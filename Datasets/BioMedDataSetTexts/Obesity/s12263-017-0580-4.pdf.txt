Does dietary fat affect inflammatory
markers in overweight and obese
individuals?—a review of randomized
controlled trials from 2010 to 2016

Abstract
Background: Obesity, a major cause of death and disability, is increasing worldwide. Obesity is characterized by a
chronic, low-grade inflammatory state which is suggested to play a critical role in the development of obesity-related
diseases like cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. In fact, in the hours following consumption of a meal, a transient
increase in inflammatory markers occurs, a response that is exaggerated in obese subjects. Dietary composition, including
content of dietary fatty acids, may affect this inflammatory response both acutely and chronically, and thereby
be predictive of progression of disease. The aim of the review was to summarize the literature from 2010 to
2016 regarding the effects of dietary fat intake on levels of inflammatory markers in overweight and obesity
in human randomized controlled trials.
Methods and results: We performed a literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed databases. The literature
search included human randomized controlled trials, both postprandial and long-term interventions, from January 2010
to September 2016. In total, 37 articles were included. Interventions with dairy products, vegetable oils, or nuts showed
minor effects on inflammatory markers. The most consistent inflammatory-mediating effects were found in intervention
with whole diets, which suggests that many components of the diet reduce inflammation synergistically. Furthermore,
interventions with weight reduction and different fatty acids did not clearly show beneficial effects on inflammatory
markers.
Conclusion: Most interventions showed either no or minor effects of dietary fat intake on inflammatory markers in
overweight and obese subjects. To progress our understanding on how diet and dietary components affect our health,
mechanistic studies are required. Hence, future studies should include whole diets and characterization of
obese phenotypes at a molecular level, including omics data and gut microbiota.

Background
Obesity and inflammation
The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide. The
number of affected individuals is nearly doubled between
1980 and 2008 [1],  and estimates show that by 2030,
prevalence will increase by 65 million in the USA and 11

million in the UK [2]. Obesity, defined as a body mass
index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or higher, is independently as-
sociated with increased mortality and is an important
risk factor for metabolic diseases, such as cardiovascular
diseases (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) [3].  Obesity
can be considered a consequence of prolonged imbal-
ance between energy intake and expenditure, driven by a
complex interplay between genes, diet, and other envir-
onmental factors [4, 5].  Interestingly, the chronic low-
grade inflammatory state of obesity [5–7] is suggested to
play a critical role in the development of obesity-related

metabolic dysfunction [8].  Adipose tissue contains adi-
pocytes and infiltrated macrophages, both of which re-
lease a spectrum of similar inflammatory mediators,
including acute-phase proteins (like PAI-1),  cytokines
(like IL-6, TNFα), and chemokines (like MCP1). Conse-
quently, circulating levels of inflammatory markers are
elevated in human obese subjects and associate with
obesity-related parameters [9–12].
Dietary fat and inflammation
Lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, play an import-
ant role in the development and progression of obesity and
its comorbidities. Specific dietary factors, such as dietary
fat, may modulate inflammation and thereby risk of disease
in humans [13]. Dietary fat is composed of different fatty
acids, like saturated fatty acids (SFA) and trans fatty acids,
monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA),  polyunsaturated
fatty acids (PUFA) of both omega (n) 6- and n3-family, and
conjugated linoleic acid (CLA). The inflammation-specific
modulatory effect of dietary fat may for example act via the
eicosanoid metabolism or as regulators of membrane and
cytosolic signaling through activation of gene expression.
Dietary fat can also directly regulate gene expression
by acting as ligand for transcription factors, such
as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors
(PPAR) and liver X receptors (LXR). Importantly, the
inflammatory response differs depending on the type
of fatty acid. Generally, while SFA and trans fat are
considered pro-inflammatory, the PUFA and especially
the long-chain (LC) n3 fatty acids are considered anti-
inflammatory. Being a precursor of pro-inflammatory
eicosanoids, n6 PUFA have been suggested to mediate
pro-inflammatory effects and thereby increase the risk
of chronic diseases in humans [14]. However, despite the
general acceptance that n6 PUFA are pro-inflammatory,
several studies show that humans with the highest
intake or plasma level of n6 PUFA have the lowest
inflammatory status and hence do not support a pro-
inflammatory effect [15].
In the hours following the consumption of a meal, a
transient increase in circulating inflammatory markers
occurs [16], which potentially contributes to endothelial
dysfunction and vascular disease [17]. The post-prandial
inflammatory reaction appears to be triggered mainly by
triglycerides and SFA, in addition to total energy and
glucose content of the meal [16, 18].  Interestingly, this
post-prandial inflammatory response is exaggerated in
obese subjects [8, 19]. Persistent increased post-prandial
exposure produces a state of chronic low-grade inflam-
mation, characterized by increased systemic levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6) and
chemokines [17], which is a critical player in the devel-
opment of many lifestyle diseases. 
Research on diet-related health effects has traditionally
examined single nutrients. Although successful, this ap-
proach has largely changed towards the examination of
food, diets, or dietary patterns. Humans do not eat single
nutrients; they eat meals with complex mixtures of dif-
ferent nutrients. In addition, many nutrients have syner-
gistic or interactive effects. Previous studies have shown
that healthy dietary patterns, characterized by increased
PUFA intake in place of SFA, are associated with de-
creased chronic low-grade inflammation, in particular
decreased level of TNFα and IL-6 [8].
Obesity-related inflammation is mainly mediated by
the increased fat mass in the obese state; however, it
may be modulated by chronic or acute exposure to diet-
ary fat. Calder and coworkers performed a comprehen-
sive review of dietary factors and inflammation in 2011,
including both dietary patterns and dietary components
(whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, soya, coffee, tea,
cocoa, fiber, milk peptides, vitamin E, vitamin C, fatty
acids, carbohydrates, iron, vitamin D, phytochemicals,
gut microbiota, prebiotics, and probiotics) [8]. They con-
clude that a healthy dietary pattern, like the Mediterra-
nean diet, is associated with decreased low-grade
inflammation in both healthy and obese individuals.
They further conclude that important protective factors
in the diet are whole grains, fiber, fruits, vegetables, fish,
PUFA, and especially n-3 PUFA, vitamin C, vitamin E,
and carotenoids. Dietary factors that are inconclusive or
have no effect on inflammation include nuts, tea, coffee,
cocoa, flavonoids, alcohol, milk peptides, vitamin D, pro-
biotics, and prebiotics, while oxidized lipids, SFA, and
trans fatty acids promote inflammation [8]. The aim of
the present review was to summarize the latest research
findings (2010–2016) in the area of dietary fat and in-
flammatory markers in overweight and obesity in human
randomized controlled trials.
Method
To identify relevant studies, we performed a literature
search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed. The
search was performed in September 2016 and was lim-
ited to publications from January 2010 to September
2016. Only original articles and randomized intervention
trials in overweight and obese humans were included.
Furthermore, only studies with information about intake
of total fat, SFA, MUFA, and PUFA, or with total fatty
acid profile in the foods or whole diet were included. In-
flammatory markers included in this article were defined
as pro-inflammatory cytokines, acute-phase proteins,
and adhesion molecules and chemokines (CRP, TNFα,
IL-6, ICAM, VCAM, and MCP1).  In addition, altered
proteome and mRNA transcripts of such markers were
included. We included studies which clearly or possibly
fulfilled the following criteria: overweight/obese subjects,

intervention with fatty acids, and at least one inflamma-
tory marker measured. Moreover, we excluded studies
that clearly fulfilled at least one of the following criteria:
not original study (for example editorial, review or con-
ference paper), animal study, or lack of inclusion criteria
measurements (as defined previously). Duplicate articles
were removed. In total, 37 articles were reviewed in full
text and included in the present article. Figure 1 shows
the flow chart of the study selection.
Results and discussion
Dietary fat and inflammatory markers
In the present review, we discuss the effects of dietary fatty
acid intake on markers of inflammation in overweight and
obese subjects, as documented by post-prandial and short-
and long-term intervention trials (parallel and cross-over
design; 3 weeks to 1 year) (Tables 1 and 2).
Dairy products
Dairy products include a vast amount of different prod-
ucts, consisting of many different nutrients, bioactive
compounds and bacteria. During the last years, several 
studies have been conducted to improve our knowledge
of the possible health effects of milk and dairy products.
Drouin-Chartier and coworkers investigated the effect of
intake of milk (3.2 servings of 2% fat milk/day) com-
pared with no servings of milk/day in a randomized
cross-over study where each period lasted for 6 weeks
[20].  No difference was seen in levels of CRP, VCAM,
ICAM, and E-selectin after the treatment in any of the
groups (Table 1). The authors concluded that short-term
milk intake has no observable favorable or deleterious
effects on cardio-metabolic risk factors [20].  Further-
more, fermented dairy products have been shown to
have cardio-protective effects [21].  Using a cross-over
design, Nestel et al. investigated the effects of full-fat fer-
mented (cheese and yogurt), full-fat non-fermented (but-
ter and cream) and low-fat (milk and yogurt) dairy
products in obese subjects [22]. Each of the three inter-
ventions lasted for 3 weeks. The low-fat products had
half the amount of total fat and a quarter amount of
SFA than the full-fat products, while MUFA and PUFA
content were similar in all groups. They did not find any
changes in the inflammatory markers CRP, TNFα,

Subjects were randomly allocated to consume 500 mL
low-fat (1.0%) milk and 150 g low-fat (1.5%) yogurt or
600 mL of fruit juice and 43 g fruit biscuits (correspond-
ing to three biscuits).  Each study period was 8 weeks.
Daily intake of dairy products compared to fruit juice
did not change fasting plasma concentration of CRP [24]
or TNFα, IL-6, ICAM, VCAM, MCP1, or sTNFR1 [23].
However, sTNFR2 was increased after dairy compared to
control food intake [23] (Table 1).
Considerable public interest has been focused on min-
imally processed products, mainly because they are 
believed to contain more natural ingredients, nutrients
and bioactive molecules, and thereby appear healthier.
In this respect, trans fatty acids occur naturally in fats
from ruminants, and fats produced using certain indus-
trial processes, and are known to have negative cardio-
metabolic effects. However, CLA, a natural trans fatty
acid, has been examined for possible beneficial health ef-
fects in several studies [25, 26]. Venkatramanan et al. in-
vestigated the effect of milk enriched with natural CLA
or enriched with synthetic CLA, compared to untreated
milk, in a randomized three-phase cross-over single-
blind trial [27].  Each dietary phase lasted for 8 weeks.
The amount of total fat was similar in the study prod-
ucts (approx. 4.0%) but the level and type of CLA dif-
fered; however, there was no difference in any of the
measured inflammatory markers between the three diet-
ary groups [27]. In another study, they compared buns
Page 11
Telle-Hansen et al. Genes & Nutrition (2017) 12:26  Page 11 of 18
with butter made of milk from grazing versus conven-
tional fed cows [28].  The fatty acid profile in both the
butter and buns were similar. After 12 weeks of inter-
vention, there were no differences in inflammatory
markers between the groups [23] (Table 1).
The six studies included in this review compare quite
different dairy products. Two of the studies found minor
differences in inflammatory markers. Whereas the full-
fat and non-fermented products slightly increased in-
flammation, only a limited amount of inflammatory
markers changed in each study. Therefore, from the
studies included in the present review, it seems that in-
take of dairy products have no favorable or deleterious
effects on inflammation (CRP, TNFα, ICAM, VCAM, IL-
1β, sTNFR1, and MIP-1α) in overweight and obese sub-
jects. Nevertheless, dairy products may have beneficial
effects by lowering CRP levels in obese subjects [8] not
captured in studies included in the present review, and
the effect may be related to non-lipid content of the
dairy products, such as matrix effects or dairy peptides.
In the present review, the focus was fat intake, and
therefore no studies specifically investigating matrix ef-
fects or dairy peptides were included, which may explain
the lack of beneficial effects.
Nuts
Nuts are high-energy, nutrient-dense foods that are rich
in PUFA and other bioactive components, including
fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals [29]. Evidence
suggests that nut consumption may have beneficial ef-
fects on oxidative stress, inflammation, and vascular re-
activity [29]. Importantly, epidemiological studies show a
negative correlation between nut intake and risk of CVD
[29] and recently, the PREDIMED study found 30% re-
duction in CVD after intake of a Mediterranean diet
enriched with mixed nuts (walnuts, almonds, and hazel-
nuts) in a high-risk CVD group [30].
Five studies that investigated the inflammatory effects
of nuts in overweight and obese subjects were included
in this review (Table 1). When investigating the effect of
the American Heart Association (AHA) dietary guide-
lines with or without enrichment of 30 g raw mixed nuts
(15 g walnuts, 7.5 g almonds, and 7.5 g hazelnuts) on in-
flammatory markers for 12 weeks, Lopez-Uriarte et al.
did not find any changes in VCAM and ICAM between
the groups [31].  However, VCAM was reduced within
the nut group. In the same study, Casas-Agustench and
coworkers investigated the effect on CRP, MCP1, IL-18,
and IL-6 [32]. A moderate weight loss was observed in
both groups. MCP1 and IL-18 levels decreased after
both diets, with no differences between the groups. The
level of IL-6 was reduced in the nut group only; how-
ever, the significance disappeared after adjusting for
weight loss. Interestingly, no differences were seen for 
plasma levels of CRP, neither within nor between the
groups [32]. Furthermore, Bakhtiary et al. did a 12-week
randomized controlled study among elderly women with
metabolic syndrome (MetS). Studying the effect of intake
of soy nuts or textured soy protein, they found no sig-
nificant differences in CRP between the groups [33]. In
another study, the effects of high oleic peanuts on
cardio-metabolic measures and CRP in healthy, over-
weight adults were examined; however, no clear effects
were found [34].  Finally, Tey and coworkers compared
the effects on inflammatory markers with consumption
of either 0, 30, or 60 g of hazelnuts per day for 12 weeks
[35]. They found no effect on any of the inflammatory
markers examined (CRP, IL-6, ICAM, and VCAM).
Despite the high-fat content of nuts, including PUFA,
intake of nuts do not seem to modulate markers of in-
flammation in overweight or obese individuals, which is
in accordance with previous review [8]. Even though two
of the five included studies found lower inflammatory
markers in the nut groups (IL-6, VCAM), the effects dis-
appeared when adjusting for weight loss or compared to
the control group.
Vegetable oils
Vegetable oils are rich in PUFA, the main constituent
being n6 fatty acids. Even though n6 fatty acids are
widely considered pro-inflammatory while n3 fatty acids
are considered anti-inflammatory, the evidence support-
ing the former is contradictory and inconclusive [6]. In
addition, there is strong evidence that n6 fatty acids pro-
mote health by reducing LDL cholesterol and thereby
the risk of CVD [30, 36–40].  Our group previously
showed no change in CRP among overweight and obese
subjects after 12 weeks of intervention with food items
where alpha-linolenic acid rich triglyceride oil was
substituted with alpha-linolenic acid rich diacylglycerol
oil [41] (Table 1). In a randomized, parallel single-blind
study, Gagliardi and coworkers investigated the effects
of daily servings of butter, no-trans-fat margarine or
plant sterol margarine on biomarkers of inflammation
and endothelial dysfunction [42].  No significant differ-
ence between the groups was found on the concentra-
tion of inflammatory and endothelial dysfunction
markers. Moreover, Bjermo et al. investigated the effects
of a high-PUFA diet (vegetable oil) or high-SFA diet
(mainly butter) on liver fat, systemic inflammation, and
metabolic disorders in a randomized study lasting for
10 weeks (the HEPFAT study) [43].  Compared to the
SFA group, liver fat, IL1Ra, and sTNFR2 were lower in
the PUFA group at the end of the study. In contrast, no
group difference was found for plasma levels of CRP, IL-
1β,  IL-6, and IL-10 [43].  Moreover, in an 8-week ran-
domized single-blind parallel intervention study, Lee and
coworkers compared the effect of three PUFA-based
Page 12

supplements, corn oil, a botanical oil, or fish oil. None
of the supplements changed the level of CRP within or
between groups [44]. In an 8-week single-blind, random-
ized trial, Rozati et al. investigated the effects of extra
virgin olive oil, compared with corn oil, soybean oil, and
butter, on quantity and functionality of a number of
lymphocyte subsets [45]. In general, there were no anti-
inflammatory effects of olive oil intake; however, the au-
thors suggested that the increased T cell proliferation in
the olive oil group might reflect immune-modulatory ef-
fects of olive oil consumption [45].
Masson and Mensink [46], Esser and coworkers [47],
and van Dijk et al. [48] all studied the difference in post-
prandial response after intake of SFA or PUFA in
overweight subjects. Masson and Mensink compared a
butter meal (14 E% SFA) and a margarine meal (8.7 E%
PUFA of which 8.0 E% was linoleic acid).  Compared
with the SFA meal, the PUFA meal decreased IL-6,
TNFα,  sTNFR1 and sTNFR2, and sVCAM [46].  Esser
et al. and Van Dijk et al. reported data from the same
study, where three different high-fat milkshake meals
consisting of palm oil, high oleic sunflower oil, or n3
PUFA (DHA) [SFA-meal (51 E% SFA), MUFA-meal (79
E% MUFA) and PUFA-meal (38 E% PUFA)] were com-
pared in both obese and lean subjects [47, 48]. Subjects
with MetS [47] and lean, obese, and obese-diabetic sub-
jects [48] were included in the studies. In the work by
Esser et al., all groups displayed a post-prandial increase
in many of the measured inflammatory markers, includ-
ing IL-8, sICAM-3, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, and a decrease
in IL-6. In contrast, and despite clear differences in
post-prandial triglyceride response and higher baseline
values of CRP in obese subjects, they found no global
differences between the groups on inflammatory re-
sponse [47]. Still, SFA consumption was associated with
higher plasma P-selectin concentration 2 h post-prandial
compared with MUFA and n3 PUFA, and lymphocyte
CD11a and CD11b expression decreased in lean partici-
pants but did not change in obese subjects [47].  Van
Dijk et al. found that plasma concentrations of IL-1β
varied both according to the type of fat and groups [48].
In addition, the TNFα level was lower after the interven-
tion in lean compared with obese and obese diabetic
subjects [48]. Palmolein, derived from dry fractionation
of palm oil, is a rich source of both SFA (42%) and
MUFA (47%),  in addition to some PUFA (12%),  and is
widely used for both frying and replacement of trans fat.
In a post-prandial study with isocaloric high protein,
high-fat meals prepared with either palmolein or olive
oil, Stonehouse and coworkers observed no differences
on endothelial function 1–5 h after intake of a high pro-
tein meal consisting of 40 g of either olive oil or palmo-
lein in overweight and obese men [49].  Finally, in
another post-prandial, cross-over study in 30 obese 
males and females, investigating the inflammatory effects
of a high-carbohydrate diet, high-MUFA diet (high oleic
sunflower oil), high-PUFA diet (sunflower oil), or a high-
SFA diet (palm oil), the researchers found no differences
between groups with regards to CRP, TNFα, and IL-6 [50].
Although tissue biopsies are often limited in human
studies, blood samples are easily accessible. Peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are a subset of the
white blood cells that include monocytes and lympho-
cytes. The PBMC, as part of the immune system, are ex-
posed to many of the same environmental factors as
metabolic tissues and provide a model for human meta-
bolic regulation and inflammation on, for example, gene
expression level [51, 52].  In addition to the circulating
inflammatory markers, Van Dijk et al. also measured the
effect of high SFA (palm oil),  high MUFA (high oleic
sunflower oil),  and high n3 PUFA (DHA) on gene ex-
pression in PBMC [48]. Intake of high-fat MUFA and n3
PUFA shakes compared to SFA shakes, induced higher
increase in the expression of MCP1 and IL-8 mRNA
levels in PBMC [48] (Table 1).
In the present review, 3 of 10 studies with vegetable
oils found some beneficial effects on inflammation
[43, 47]. Except for some contradictory effects observed at
gene expression level in the study by Van Dijk et al. [48],
none of the studies found convincing evidence of in-
creasing circulating inflammatory markers after intake of
vegetable oils. Hence, vegetable oils do not seem to have
detrimental inflammatory effects in overweight and
obese subjects, and might even have some beneficial ef-
fects. These findings correlate with different studies
showing reduced risk of CVD and cholesterol after in-
take of n6 fatty acids. Ulven et al. obtained 11% reduc-
tion in LDL cholesterol when replacing 5% of the energy
from SFA with PUFA, mainly linoleic acid, with no effect
on inflammatory markers in normal weight individuals
[38]. Farvid and coworkers have shown that by replacing
5% of the energy from SFA with linoleic acid, gives a
13% reduction in risk of coronary artery disease (CAD)
mortality and 9% in cardiac events [37].  In the PRE-
DIMED study, a 13% reduction in risk of stroke, heart
infarction and cardiovascular mortality was obtained
with a diet high in linoleic acid [30]. In addition, epi-
demiological studies show similar results [39].
Mixed diets
Humans eat mixed diets, not single nutrients. Conse-
quently, researchers have shifted focus to examine the
health effects of complex diets and dietary patterns in-
stead of the classic reductionist approach. The Mediter-
ranean diet has long been related to improved health,
while a westernized diet has the opposite effect. Simi-
larly, a healthy Nordic diet associate with lower mortal-
ity and improve cardiovascular risk factors [53, 54]. Both
Page 13

Uusitupa and De Mello have investigated the effects of a
healthy Nordic diet on inflammatory markers in obese
individuals with MetS [55] or impaired glucose metabol-
ism [56], respectively. In those studies, a healthy Nordic
diet included whole grain (of which ≥ 50% rye, barley,
and oat), cereals, fruits, vegetables and berries, rapeseed
oil, margarine, low-fat dairy products, fish, white meat,
and avoidance of sugar-sweetened beverages. The con-
trol diet included refined cereal products (of which ≥
90% as wheat) and butter, less fruits and vegetables and
no berries, and less than one meal of fish per week.
There were no limits of dairy products, meat and sugar-
sweetened beverages. Uusitupa et al. found decreased
levels of IL1Ra with the healthy diet compared with the
control diet. In addition, there was an association be-
tween intake of saturated fats and IL1Ra [55] (Table 1).
De Mello et al. found decreased levels of E-selectin in
the healthy diet group compared with the control diet
group, and CRP levels decreased both within the healthy
diet and whole grain enriched diet (WGED),  but there
were no difference when compared with control diet
[56]. Furthermore, Camhi et al. examined CRP changes
in subjects with MetS enrolled in a lifestyle intervention
trial with factorial design (the DEER trial) [57, 58]. Sub-
jects were randomly assigned to a control group, an ex-
ercise group, a diet group (NCEP-II guidelines), or a diet
and exercise group. CRP was reduced in the two latter
groups, but in women only. In men and in women and
men combined, however, CRP was unchanged. In
addition, in that study, there was no effect of exercise on
CRP levels [57]. Finally, in a fully controlled study with
14 overweight and obese, dyslipidemic women, CRP
levels decreased after 3 weeks with a high-PUFA diet
compared to a high-SFA diet [59] (Table 1).
Measuring the effects of single nutrients or foods
might be difficult due to sensitivity of the analyses, as
well as the fact that many nutrients are correlated in
dietary patterns. In the present review, three of the four
studies decreased levels of CRP or other inflammatory
markers after intervention with mixed diets, in addition
to some within group effects. The NCEP-based diet, a
Nordic diet, and a high-PUFA diet all showed beneficial
effects on inflammation, as evidenced by decreased CRP,
E-selectin, and IL1Ra. This finding indicates that a
change in whole diet is more effective with regard to in-
flammation compared to change of single components
of the diet. This may be explained by the accumulation
of many small effects and the synergy of single nutrients,
or that compliance is easier for participants when given
a whole diet instead of single nutrients or foods, thereby
also contributing to decreasing confounding factors and
practical obstacles. Several studies have shown beneficial
health effects of exchanging SFA with PUFA, and in the
review by Calder et al., they suggest that Mediterranean 
diet, characterized by high intake of PUFA, may lead to
decreased chronic low-grade inflammation [8]. Hence, it
is conceivable that a healthy fatty acid composition (high
PUFA and low SFA) as part of a healthy dietary pattern
may be of importance in reducing systemic low-grade
inflammation when overweight or obese.
The LIPGENE study
In the pan-European LIPGENE study, researchers inves-
tigated whether high-SFA diet (HSFA), high-MUFA diet
(HMUFA),  or low-fat, high-complex carbohydrate diets
supplemented with either sunflower oil (LFHCC-SFO)
or long chain (LC) n3 fatty acids (LFHCC-LC n3) for
12 weeks affected CRP [60],  IL-6, TNFα,  ICAM, or
VCAM [61] in subjects with MetS (Table 1).  No diet-
specific effects were found. In contrast, after 12 weeks of
intervention, a post-prandial fat challenge was per-
formed, and ICAM [62] was reduced with the HMUFA
diet compared with the LFHCC-LC n3 and HSFA diets,
while MCP1 [63] were reduced with both HMUFA and
LFHCC-LC n3 diets compared to HSFA diet. In con-
trast, in later analyses, Meneses and coworkers did not
find any changes in IL-6 or MCP1 after the post-
prandial fat challenge [64].
Dietary fatty acids may affect health via several mecha-
nisms, for example by influencing the activity of tran-
scription factors involved in metabolic regulation and
inflammation, like NF-κB and PPARγ [6, 8]. Changes in
adipose tissue gene expression was studied in the LIP-
GENE study, and it was shown that the mRNA level of
p65 (sub-unit of the NF-κB transcription factor) was in-
duced by a HSFA challenge meal, but with no apparent
difference between the four different test meals [64].
Post hoc statistical analyses, however, showed that the
p65 gene expression level was increased after intake of
LFHCC-SFO and LFHCC-LC n3 diets. In addition, the
post-prandial (4 h) IκBa gene expression in PBMC was
increased after HSFA compared with LFHCC-LC n3 di-
ets [63]. In contrast, fasting IκBa gene expression level
was increased after 12 weeks of intervention and post-
prandial (0 h) with the LFHCC-LC n3 diet compared
with HSFA and MUFA diets. Furthermore, post-prandial
PBMC TNFα and MMP-9 mRNA levels were reduced
after intake of the HMUFA compared with the HSFA
diet. After the HMUFA post-prandial fat challenge, the
mRNA level of TNFα and metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)
were downregulated in PBMC compared with the HSFA
fat challenge [63]. Moreover, the post-prandial effect on
the PBMC proteome (nuclear and cytoplasmic) was also
examined in the LIPGENE study by Rangel-Zuniga et al.
[65] and Camargo et al. [66]. The PBMC proteome (nu-
clear and cytoplasmic) displayed changes in pro-
inflammatory proteins after intake of HMUFA (F2,
TLN1, GSN, CAPZ) and LFHCC-LC n3 diets (FGB,
Page 14
Telle-Hansen et al. Genes & Nutrition (2017) 12:26  Page 14 of 18
FGG, VCL, ACTB, CAPZA1, and MACF1) [65].  Path-
ways analysis showed that inflammatory response pro-
tein was differently expressed 4 h after intake of four
different meals with different fat quality. In particular,
pathway analysis showed that the top function associated
with protein differently expressed after intake of a HSFA
meal was inflammatory response (HLA-C, THBS1, and
PSME1 were upregulated, and PLEC, FGB, and HSPA1A
were downregulated) [66] (Table 1).
Inflammatory markers, both circulating and mRNA
levels (TNFα,  ICAM, MCP1, p65, and MMP-9),  were
investigated in the LIPGENE study, in which four of the
seven studies investigated gene expression and or prote-
ome effects. Taken together, the results from the LIP-
GENE study suggest that a high-MUFA diet, and to a
lesser extent a LFHCC diet, have some anti-inflammatory
effects compared with high-SFA diet. However, only two
of the studies showed effects on circulating inflammatory
markers, both investigating effect after a fat challenge; the
other studies showed no effect, and it is therefore difficult
to draw firm conclusions.
Fatty acids in weight reduction studies
Diet-induced weight reduction effectively improves
obesity-related metabolic aberrations and low-grade in-
flammation. However, the importance of dietary fat in
the rising prevalence of overweight and obesity is un-
known. While some studies show no association be-
tween dietary fat intake and body weight, other studies
do find an association [67, 68]. However, during the past
years, several studies have confirmed that total energy
intake, rather than macronutrients distribution per se, is
the more important determinant of weight reduction
and maintenance [69, 70]. Therefore, it is of high inter-
est to elucidate if different fatty acids, as part of a diet-
induced weight reduction, will affect the low-grade
inflammatory status observed in overweight and obesity.
Tovar and coworkers [71] investigated the cardio-
metabolic protective effect of an 8-week multifunctional
diet (MFD; including food items such as low-glycemic-
impact meals, antioxidant-rich foods, oily fish, viscous
dietary fibers, soybean and whole barley, kernel products,
almonds, and plant stanols) in overweight and obese sub-
jects, compared with a control diet where none of the
abovementioned functional food items were included.
Some of the food items were included in the control diet
was provided such as white wheat bread, dark wheat
bread, parboiled rice, cornflakes, champignon spread,
prawn spread, powdered pastry cream, fruit preserves, and
mango chutney. Both diets were designed according to
the Nordic nutrition recommendations. Both diets re-
sulted in a weight loss of approximately 2%. There was no
difference between the diets in levels of CRP between the
groups (Table 2).  Silver et al. tested the effect of a 16- 
week, high-fat diet-based weight reduction interven-
tion [72].  The high-fat diets were supplemented with
either 9 g/d of stearate (18:0),  oleate (18:1),  linoleate
(18:2),  or placebo, and a panel of inflammatory
markers was measured. All four groups each lost 5 kg
weight, which accounted for most of the observed ef-
fects on the inflammatory markers (IL-1a, IL-1β,  IL-
12, IL-17, IFNγ,  TNFα,  and TNFβ).  Using linear
mixed models, adjusting for weight change and com-
pared with the control group, the authors showed
that the main effects of 18:0 was a drastic reduction
of IFNγ,  and the main effects of 18:1 was a small in-
crease in IL-1β,  IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNFα.  Sur-
prisingly, there were no main effects of 18:2 [72].  In
a 12-week weight reduction trial, De Luis et al. inves-
tigated the effects of a PUFA or MUFA diet, as well
as interaction with GLP-1 variants, on CRP [73]. They
found no differences in CRP with either the dietary
interventions or the genetic variants. Su et al. investi-
gated the effect of n3 supplementation on inflamma-
tory markers in the context of a 12-week weight
reduction [74].  Women with MetS were randomly
assigned to one of four interventions: energy restric-
tion, energy restriction with meal replacement, energy
restriction with fish oil, or energy restriction with
meal replacement and fish oil. Although they found a
small additive effect of n3 supplementation, the au-
thors concluded that the weight reduction was a more
important determinant of changes in inflammatory
markers than fish oil intake [74].  Moreover, the effect
of low-fat versus low-carbohydrate diets on inflamma-
tion was investigated in 103 males and females for
12 weeks [75].  The low-fat diet group ingested less
than 30 E% from fat (with < 7 E% from SFA) and 55
E% from carbohydrates, while the low-carbohydrate
diet group had less than 40 g per day of digestible
carbohydrates (total carbohydrates minus fiber).  Com-
pared to the low-fat diet, intervention with the low-
carbohydrate diet decreased CRP levels [75] (Table 2).
Weight reduction per se will have positive cardio-
metabolic effects, including reduced inflammation [76].
However, only one of the weight reduction studies in-
cluded in this review found a beneficial effect on CRP
between groups with different dietary fat composition.
Moreover, one of the studies found that a high fat diet
supplemented with oleate compared to placebo in-
creased several inflammatory markers despite a weight
reduction [72].  The present review do not focus on
weight reduction and inflammatory response, but rather
fat quality and inflammatory response, which might ex-
plain the discrepancy between the present review com-
pared with previous studies [76]. The limitation in time,
giving a limited amount of studies in the present review
may also influence the results.

Conclusion
Obesity is associated with pathological changes in adi-
pose tissue morphology, including infiltration of immune
cells, and obese individuals have higher circulating levels
of inflammatory markers than lean individuals [5, 7]. As-
sociations between intake or status of various fatty acids
and inflammatory markers have been examined in hu-
man studies and there is a general agreement that
increasing dietary SFA intake, especially in overweight
and obese individuals, is associated with raised inflam-
matory markers [8].  In the present review comprising
studies between January 2010 and September 2016, we
only found minor effects of dietary fat on inflammatory
markers in overweight and obese subjects. The most
consistent effects were found after intervention with
whole diets. Dairy products, vegetable oils and fatty
acids in dietary weight reduction studies only showed
minor effects, while nuts did not seem to have any ef-
fects on inflammatory markers. Due to small effects,
large inter-individual differences and insensitive methods,
dietary health effects are difficult to measure. This might
explain why we do not find any effects after intervention
with single nutrients or foods in the present review. How-
ever, nutrients in whole diets may have synergistic effects,
and thereby be able to affect the inflammatory system
with more beneficial effects. To measure diet-induced
changes, it may be necessary to temporarily disrupt the
body’s homeostasis, which may be done with dietary
challenge tests. The extent of the disruption and the speed
of recovery to homeostasis may be considered as health
indicators [77].
Only two of the studies investigating the effect of
mixed diets found differences between subgroups among
the intervention groups. In the study by De Mello et al.,
the CRP level was significantly reduced after the WEGD
diet compared with the control diet, but only when ex-
cluding statin users [56]. Similar, CRP level was reduced
between the diet- and diet/exercise group compared
with the control group, but only in women with MetS
[57]. Due to the small effect sizes expected from dietary
interventions, medications that influence inflammation
may camouflage a real effect. In addition, different effect
sizes between men and women are commonly registered.
This is maybe due to physiological or pathophysiological
differences between the sexes, or differences in compli-
ance and motivation. Finally, subtle differences in base-
line level of inflammation may appear as differences in
response to diet. Responses to dietary challenges post-
prandial may be more informative than measurement of
fasting homeostatic measures. In the present review,
nine articles included post-prandial measures, in which
five found changes in inflammatory response. Hence, a
dietary challenge apparently showed a more consistent
response. However, four articles were from the LIPGENE 
study, therefore making it difficult to conclude if studies
including a challenge are more efficient in differentiating
the response elicited by diet.
Investigating the transcriptomic profile in different
cells can improve our understanding of the metabolic
regulation and provide insights into the mechanisms of
metabolic disease. Investigating metabolic responses of
food and nutrients optimally involve tissue biopsies.
However, invasive biopsy procedures are a limiting factor
in human studies, while blood samples are easily access-
ible. Diet-induced changes in concentration of circulating
inflammatory markers compared to tissue concentrations
may be undetectable, but the PBMC gene expression mea-
surements may be more sensitive than plasma proteins to
alterations in circulating nutrients. Also, PBMC are hy-
pothesized to be a relevant substitute for investigating
metabolic regulation in tissues and are frequently used as
an indirect measure, particularly of gene regulation
[51, 52].  Svahn et al. compared the transcriptome
effect of dietary fat in different organs. In contrast to
the hypothesis stated above, they found that dietary
fatty acids affected the transcriptome in distinct man-
ners in different organs [78],  demonstrating the com-
plexity of diet-gene interactions and the interpretation
of dietary intervention studies. The present review did
not find obvious effects of dietary fat on gene expres-
sion or proteomic related to inflammation; however,
few studies investigating gene expression or proteome
were included.
Obese individuals represent a heterogeneous group with
different phenotypes. Interestingly, a subgroup of obese in-
dividuals has been described as “metabolically healthy
obese” (MHO).  In contrast to at-risk obese (ARO),  the
MHO phenotype is defined by a favorable cardio-metabolic
profile, despite the same amount of body fat, including a
more favorable inflammatory profile, less visceral fat, less
infiltration of macrophages into adipose tissue, and smaller
adipocyte cell size [52, 79–81]. The studies included in the
present review have not presented data of differentiated ef-
fects in different obese phenotypes. It has been estimated
that 18–44% of all obese may be categorized as MHO [82]
and because the effect sizes may be small, it may be difficult
to detect dietary effects on inflammation when investigating
all obese as one group. During the past years, increasing
focus has been given to the relation between gut microbiota
and health. Several studies have confirmed a direct implica-
tion of gut microbiota in obesity progression [83] and gut
microbiota is established as a determining factor in obesity-
related inflammation [83]. Gut microbiota are affected by
several factors, including dietary factors like fat quality and
quantity and fiber. The present review investigates
inflammatory-modulating effects of mainly dietary fat qual-
ity, and to some degree quantity. However, the proportion
of fat versus other dietary components, like fiber or the
Page 16
Telle-Hansen et al. Genes & Nutrition (2017) 12:26  Page 16 of 18
composition of gut microbiota, is not included in any
of the studies.
In the present article, only a restricted part of the sci-
entific field has been reviewed. Our literature search was
limited to randomized controlled trials with fatty acids
in overweight and obese subjects, published between
2010 and 2016 that included measurement of inflamma-
tory markers. In addition, we have categorized the
included studies according to type of dietary interven-
tion. Hence, some of the studies may be relevant in
more than one category, which may have affected the
conclusion. Taken together, in the present review we find
minor changes in inflammation after modulating fat in-
take in overweight and obese subjects. Even though ran-
domized controlled trials are superior when studying
cause-and-effect, they do not necessarily have a mechan-
istic approach. To progress our understanding on how
diet and dietary components affect our health, mechan-
istic studies are required. Hence, future studies should
include whole diets and characterization of obese pheno-
types at a molecular level, including omics data and gut
microbiota to help us understand the role of diet on low-
grade inflammation in overweight and obese subjects.
