Abstract
Background: Malaria during pregnancy remains a serious public health problem, with substantial risks for the
mother, her foetus and the newborn. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of malaria and
possible risk factors for malaria infection among pregnant women in a semi-urban area in north-western Nigeria.
Pregnant women are among the most susceptible to malaria infection. Knowledge of their malaria infection status
is an important yardstick to measure the effectiveness of any malaria control programme.
Methods: We conducted a cross sectional study in the semi-urban area of Argungu, Kebbi State Nigeria. Two hundred
and fifty five pregnant women were included in the study after informed verbal consent was obtained. For each
participant, the socio-demographic profile, stage of pregnancy and attitude to the use of insecticide- treated nets
(ITNs) were investigated using a questionnaire. Peripheral blood samples were collected and thick blood smears were
prepared and stained with Giemsa stains to check for malaria parasitaemia. The associations between age, education
level and use of ITNs with occurrence of malaria infection during pregnancy were analysed using the chi-square test.
Results: One hundred and six (41.6%) out of 255 pregnant women were infected with malaria parasites, with a
mean parasite density of 800 parasitesμl−1. It was found that prevalence and parasite density decreased as age
increased. The chi-square test indicated that a lack of education and non-usage of ITNs were significantly
associated with malaria infection.
Conclusion: Malaria is still a major public health issue among pregnant women mainly due to illiteracy and
non -compliance to using ITNs. Increasing awareness about malaria preventive measures and early attendance of
antenatal care services will help to reduce malaria and, consequently, its associated morbidities and mortalities.

P. ovale, P. vivax, and P. knowlesi. The disease is
transmitted by the bite of infected female Anopheles mos-
quitoes. Malaria in pregnancy is caused mainly by the spe-
cie P. falciparum, which is the most common species in
Africa.In malaria endemic regions, individuals are con-
stantly exposed to malaria parasites through bites of the
aforementioned mosquitoes. This frequent exposure leads
to the development of an effective anti-disease immunity,
which prevents life-threatening parasite burdens and sup-
presses the pro-inflammatory responses that cause illness

the newborn. Most cases of malaria in pregnancy in areas
of stable malaria transmission are asymptomatic [2]. De-
pending on the endemicity of malaria in an area, it can be
expected that 1–50% of pregnant women may carry malaria
parasitaemia, especially in the placenta, without noticing it
[3].  This is attributed to anti-disease immunity acquired
during previous exposure that protects against clinical mal-
aria [4]. Pregnant women are three times more likely to suf-
fer from severe diseases as a result of malarial infection
compared with their non-pregnant counterparts, and have
a mortality rate that approaches 50% [5]. The principal im-
pact of malaria infection is due to the presence of parasites
in the placenta, which causes maternal anaemia and low
birth weight [6]. Beyond the post-partum period, the long
term consequences of malaria during pregnancy on the in-
fant include poor development, behavioural problems,
short stature and neurological deficits [7].
Protection of pregnant women living in malaria endemic
countries has been of particular interest to many malaria
control programmes because of this group’s higher sus-
ceptibility and reduced immunity. Nigeria, accounts for
one fourth of all malaria cases in the 45 endemic countries
in Africa [8], and 11% of maternal deaths in the country
are attributed to malaria [9].  Positively, malaria control
measures have received a greater attention in the last dec-
ade as increased funding has resulted in the scaling up of
malaria control programmes. Use of insecticide-treated
nets (ITNs) is one of the key components of malaria pre-
vention and control as recommended by the World
Health Organization (WHO) [10]. The nets reduce human
contact with mosquitoes, thus leading to a significant re-
duction in the incidence of malaria, associated morbidity,
and mortality; as well as in the adverse effects during preg-
nancy in areas of intense malaria transmission [11].
Another key intervention for controlling malaria and
its effects during pregnancy is the administration of
intermittent preventive treatment (IPT). This consists of
a full therapeutic course of antimalarial medicine given
to pregnant women at routine prenatal visits, regardless
of whether they are infected with malaria or not. Inter-
mittent preventive treatment reduces incidences of ma-
ternal malaria episodes, maternal and foetal anaemia,
placental parasitaemia, low birth weight and neonatal
mortality. Therefore, the WHO recommends IPT with
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in areas with moderate to
high malaria transmission in Africa [12].
As the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) programme has been
around for more than a decade in Africa, it is time to as-
sess the current impact of the disease among pregnant
women who are considered to be one of the most vul-
nerable groups. This forms the basis for the present
study, which aimed at assessing the prevalence of mal-
aria infection and associated risk factors among pregnant
women in a semi-urban area of north-western Nigeria. 
Methods
Study site and study design
A cross-sectional survey was undertaken from August to
October 2012 at the Kokani south ward located in the
semi-urban area of Argungu, north- west Nigeria.
Data collection
Sample size
The sample size calculation was based on the formula
described by Araoye [13] for estimating sample size. We
used a malaria prevalence of 22.29% from a previous
study [14] at a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a 5%
margin of error. A sample size of 266 pregnant women
was required. Only 255 participated, with 11 declining
due to their husbands not allowing them to participate.
Data collection
A census to determine the number of households with
pregnant women was conducted prior to sampling. A
total number of 850 households were listed to form the
sampling frame. Out of this 266 pregnant women in
their second trimester were randomly selected based on
interviews with household heads. Trained research assis-
tants administered the questionnaires. Data on the age,
education level and ITNs usages of the selected pregnant
women were collected and sorted.
Laboratory methods
One ml of peripheral blood samples were collected by
three medical laboratory scientists through veni-puncture
from all recruited pregnant women and later taken to the
laboratory at the General Hospital Argungu for detection
of malaria parasites. Thick blood films were prepared on
the grease- free, clean glass slides by spreading two drops
of blood over a diameter of 15 mm. The slides were made
in duplicates for each subject and labelled accordingly,
and were allowed to dry for 24–48 hours before being
stained with Giemsa at pH 7.2 for 45 minutes. Two med-
ical laboratory scientists examined the stained slides and
discrepancies between the two scientists were resolved by
re-examination before the final result was determined. A
slide was considered negative when 100 high- power fields
were examined under oil immersion objective. Taking the
number of leucocytes per micro-litre of blood as 6,000,
parasite density was expressed as: parasite count × 6,000
divided by the number of leucocytes counted as described
elsewhere [15].
Statistical analysis
Data generated from the study were analysed using IBM
SPSS statistical software version 20. Chi-square test was
used to study associations and differences.

Ethical consideration
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the
Ethical Committee of the Ministry of Health in Kebbi
State. Verbal informed consent from all the participating
pregnant women was also obtained. They participants
were informed that participation in the research was vol-
untary and they could opt out at any stage of the re-
search. Pregnant women who were diagnosed with
malaria infection were treated using artemisinin-based
combination therapies (ACTs) according to national
malaria treatment policy in Nigeria.
Results
The demographic characteristics of the 255 pregnant
women who participated in this study are summarised in
Table 1. The average age of the participants was 26.1 ±
1.7 years (range:- 14 – 41). Over one- third (36.1%) had
no education, whilst 25.0%,  21.6%,  and 17.3% had pri-
mary, secondary and tertiary education, respectively.
One hundred and forty-eight women used ITNs (58.0%),
while 107 (42.0%) didn’t use nets. Malaria prevalence
was 41.6%.  Age was not significantly associated with

malaria prevalence (x2 = 5.27, p = 0.153); the 14 – 20 age
group had the highest prevalence (51.6%),  as well as
highest mean parasite density (800 parasitesμl−1  of
blood) (see Table 2).
There was a significant association between malaria
prevalence and education (x2 = 20.9, p = 0.000).  Malaria
prevalence in women with no education was 63.0%, while
in those with primary, secondary and tertiary education, it
was 45.3%, 32.7%, and 27.3% respectively (see Table 3).
Use of ITNs was significantly associated with malaria
prevalence and parasite density, as the number of partic-
ipants who did not use ITNs regularly reported a high
occurrence of malaria infection with a high parasite dens-
ity, as compared to those who used ITNs on a daily basis
(x2 = 33.6, p = 0.000). While malaria prevalence and para-
site density were 62.6% and 800 parasitesμl−1 of blood
among non- ITN users, it was 26.4% and 600 parasitesμl−1
of blood, respectively, among ITN users (see Table 4).
Discussion
In this study, the prevalence of malaria infection among
pregnant women in Argungu was found to be 41.6%.
This finding is higher than in Maiduguri where a preva-
lence of 22.1% was reported among pregnant women
[16].  It also contrasts sharply with findings in Lagos,
where a prevalence rate of 7.7% among pregnant women
attending antenatal clinics for the first time during
current pregnancy was reported [17].  However, these
findings corroborated with the results in Otukpo, Benue
State, where a total prevalence of 42.3% was recorded
[18]. This high rate of malaria among pregnant women
in the area urgently calls for the need to review the

control measures available, with a view to possibly rede-
signing the control programmes.
In our study, it was observed that maternal age was as-
sociated with malaria prevalence, showing that a preg-
nant woman of younger maternal age is at a greatest risk
of malaria infection, as well as having the highest para-
site densities. Similar findings have been reported in
Lagos where prevalence and parasite density were observed
to decrease as age increased [19] It has been consistently
demonstrated that infection rates are higher in women in
their first and second pregnancies, with lower rates in later
pregnancies [20]. This is understandable as pregnancy is
naturally accompanied by general immune suppression
that may cause loss of acquired immunity to malaria espe-
cially among primigravidae. This is because they lack the
specific immunity to placental malaria that is acquired
from exposure to malaria parasites during pregnancy [4].
This immunity accumulates with successive pregnancies,
provided there is exposure to malaria infection [21].
There was a strong association between education
level and malaria infection. Prevalence of malaria and
parasite density among pregnant women in the area de-
creased proportionately with the increase in education
level. It was observed that non- educated pregnant
women had the highest prevalence rate, while those with
a tertiary level of education had the lowest. However, a
previous study conducted in Lagos indicated that educa-
tion was not significantly associated with malaria infection
among pregnant women [19]. This stresses the role educa-
tion could have on the overall success of malaria control
programmes in the region. Government policies should be
geared towards improving citizens’  of education statuses
in order to reduce the burden of the disease in the coun-
try, especially among the most vulnerable population.
The use of ITNs decreases both the number of malaria
cases and malaria deaths in pregnant women [22].  In
our study, use of ITNs was found to be associated with
malaria infection; pregnant women who did not use
ITNs frequently, were more affected by malaria as com-
pared to those who did. A previous study conducted in
Otukpo also indicated that the rate of malaria increases
with a proportionate decrease in the use of ITNs [18].
Study limitations
Although the study offers some important findings, it also
has limitations: The study was cross sectional and the
sample size was not very large, therefore the possibility of
sampling error cannot be overruled. Factors such as gra-
vidity, trimester, whether IPT was given and frequency of
antenatal care visits were not assessed. Also, the study
used ITNs as the sole indicator of control measures, but
the usage of other measures such as indoor residual spray-
ing (IRS),  larvicides and mosquito repellent coils was
not assessed. 
Conclusion
Malaria is still a major public health problem among
pregnant women in Argungu. Lack of education and
non-usage of ITNs were the major factors associated
with an increased risk of malaria infection. The control
measures available in the area should be reviewed and
emphasis should be placed on adequate sensitisation on
usage of ITNs. Early attendance and participation in fo-
cused ante-natal care services should be encouraged
among all pregnant women especially the primigravidae,
in order to reduce the risk of malaria infection in preg-
nancy. Again, awareness on malaria prevention measures
during pregnancy should target young women even be-
fore marriage preferably at schools, and social and
religious gatherings.
