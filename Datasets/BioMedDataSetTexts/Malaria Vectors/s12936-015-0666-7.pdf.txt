Imported malaria among people who travel to
visit friends and relatives: is current UK policy
effective or does it need a strategic change?
Ron H Behrens1*, Penny E Neave2 and Caroline OH Jones3,4,5
Abstract
Background: The proportion of all imported malaria reported in travellers visiting friends and relatives (VFRs) in the
UK has increased over the past decade and the proportion of Plasmodium falciparum malaria affecting this group
has remained above 80% during that period. The epidemiological data suggest that the strategies employed in the
UK to prevent imported malaria have been ineffective for VFRs. This paper attempts to identify possible reasons for
the failure of the malaria prevention strategy among VFRs and suggest potential alternatives.
Methods: A review of the current UK malaria prevention guidelines was undertaken and their approach was compared
to the few data that are available on malaria perceptions and practices among VFRs.
Results: The current UK malaria prevention guidelines focus on educating travellers and health professionals
using messages based on the personal threat of malaria and promoting the benefits of avoiding disease through
the use of chemoprophylaxis. While malaria morbidity disproportionately affects VFRs, the mortality rates from
malaria in VFRs is eight times, and severe disease eight times lower than in tourist and business travellers. Recent
research into VFR malaria perceptions and practices has highlighted the complex socio-ecological context within
which VFRs make their decisions about malaria. These data suggest that alternative strategies that move beyond
a knowledge-deficit approach are required to address the burden of malaria in VFRs.
Discussion: Potential alternative strategies include the use of standby emergency-treatment (SBET) for the management
of fevers with an anti-malarial provided pre-travel, the provision of rapid diagnostic testing and treatment regimen based
in general-practitioner surgeries, and urgent and walk-in care centres and local accident and emergency (A&E)
departments to provide immediate diagnosis and accessible ambulatory treatment for malaria patients. This latter
approach would potentially address some of the practical barriers to reducing the burden of malaria in VFRs by moving
the process nearer to the community.
Background
Between 2002 and 2013 there was a total of 17,811 re-
ports of imported malaria in the UK [1]. The majority of
cases were among individuals travelling to West African
countries who had acquired Plasmodium falciparum
whilst visiting friends and relatives (VFRs). For example,
in 2013, the year for which the most recent data are
available, 65% of all 1,501 malaria cases reported were
acquired in West Africa, nearly 80% were caused by P.

falciparum and 82% were among people who were
VFRs [1].
The profile of imported malaria is similar in other
European countries. In France between 2001 and 2004,
of the estimated 6,500 to 7,000 annual cases, 83% were
of P. falciparum and more than 90% of P. falciparum
cases were imported from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA),
the majority from West African countries [2]. More re-
cent data from 2012 show that 95.8% of the estimated
3,510 cases imported into France were acquired in African
countries, and 88% of infections were caused by P. fal-
ciparum [2,3]. In Italy, between 2000 and 2006, 83% of
all 5,219 reports of imported malaria were caused by

P. falciparum and the majority (93%) were acquired in
sub-Saharan Africa [4].
It is clear that imported malaria morbidity dispropor-
tionately affects VFRs. The proportion of all reported
malaria cases in the UK affecting VFRs increased from
65% in 2002 to 79% in 2013, with the total proportion
remaining above 70% and P. falciparum over 80% over
the past ten years (Figure 1). In France a similar trend is
seen, with the proportion of P. falciparum cases in VFRs
increasing from 50% in 1996 to 82% in 2011 [3].
Despite the burden of morbidity, the case fatality rate
from malaria among VFRs is significantly lower than that
among non-VFRs. The data published from the UK
Malaria Reference Laboratory (MRL) found that the
case fatality was 3.0% in tourists compared with 0.32%
in VFR travellers, an odds ratio of 8.2 [5]. Similar findings
on the severity of malaria were found in France, where a
significantly lower odds ratio of 0.25 of VFRs developing
severe malaria compared to matched cases in travellers of
European origin was reported [6].  These differences in
case fatality rate between VFRs and non-VFRs with
malaria and the potential role of immunity to malaria needs
further research.
These data suggest that the malaria prevention policies
in these two countries are failing to effectively target pre-
vention of imported P. falciparum in VFR travellers who
have a high incidence of infections, but low case fatality
rates.
In light of this epidemiological evidence, the question
was raised – are the current approaches to preventing
malaria among VFRs in the UK the most appropriate
way of dealing with the continuing burden of disease in
VFRs, or should policy makers be rethinking the preven-
tion strategy? 
UK malaria prevention policy: ABCD
In the UK the national recommended guidelines for mal-
aria prevention are developed for Public Health England
(PHE) by the Advisory Committee on Malaria Prevention
(ACMP), a multi-professional group who formulate deci-
sions based on a risk assessment of contracting malaria
in country-specific destinations [7]. The Committee pro-
duces annual guidelines on malaria prevention for use by
both healthcare workers who advise travellers, and for
prospective travellers who wish to understand the malaria
risks and options for mitigating them. The guidelines
are based on a range of sources of information including:
expert opinion, published research and the recommen-
dations of other technical bodies, including the World
Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control
USA, and the Malaria Atlas Project (Chiodini, pers comm).
The acronym ‘ABCD’ reflects the main strategies in the UK
guidelines, where A is an awareness of the risk, B refers to
bite prevention, C stipulates the need for chemoprophy-
laxis, and D emphasises the importance of rapid diagnosis
and treatment [7]. Within the guidelines, VFRs are recog-
nized as a ‘special category’  but the advice proposed for
them is similar to the advice set out for other travellers,
particularly the requirement for chemoprophylaxis. There
is, however, an added emphasis on the need to raise aware-
ness in this high-risk group, emphasizing that malaria is
not a trivial disease and that acquired semi-immunity may
be quickly lost. The guidelines suggest that the best strat-
egy for increasing the use of effective malaria prevention
measures in VFRs is the dissemination of appropriately tai-
lored health information targeted to migrant communities,
especially of West African descent, stressing the im-
portance of chemoprophylaxis use when travelling. The
guidelines further state that health advisers for this group,
including primary care practitioners working in areas with
large numbers of migrants, can have an important role to
play.

2002–2013, with the proportion of all malaria and Plasmodium

is known). Data provided by the PHE Malaria Reference Laboratory. 
VFR awareness of malaria risk (A)
Studies on the knowledge and perception of the risk of
malaria among VFRs in the UK suggest that the majority
are aware of the potential risk of contracting the disease
when they travel to their country of origin [8,9] and simi-
lar knowledge levels have been found among VFR travel-
lers living in France [10]. However, knowledge of malaria,
its presence and transmission do not always mean that
malaria is perceived as a significant health threat to be
actively avoided [11-14].
The few data that are available on VFR perceptions of
personal risk of severe illness and death from malaria sug-
gest that their perceptions are at variance with the advice
provided by PHE. For example, there are the frequent re-
ports amongst VFR travellers of feelings of competence in
their ability to self-manage the disease, both recognizing

and managing symptoms of malaria [11]. Several studies
have found that VFR travellers who suspected they had
malaria while in their travel destination followed local prac-
tices and obtained treatment drugs from local providers
(pharmacies, stores and street vendors) without a para-
sitological diagnosis, with many reportedly making a full
recovery [11,12,15]. It is likely that these self-treatment be-
haviours were influenced by the context within which the
disease was experienced, where the support of family and
friends was available and the actions reflect common
management practices in endemic destinations [16]. Re-
cent research among a small group of VFRs in London
suggests that among this group there was a perception,
based on experience, that the risk of malaria was not ne-
cessarily life threatening to themselves, but could become
a medical emergency if not treated in a timely and appro-
priate manner; that some groups of people (e.g.,  young
children) were more likely to become severely ill if they
contract the disease [12].  The study also found that a
number of these VFRs had confidence in their ability, and
that of doctors and pharmacists in their country of origin,
to diagnose and treat malaria appropriately, but less confi-
dence in the approach of practitioners in the UK National
Health Service (NHS) to the identification and treatment
of the disease [12].  Interestingly, these sentiments were
echoed by some of the NHS health care providers inter-
viewed as part of the same study [17], and similar findings
have been reported from a study in the USA which inves-
tigated travel health practices of the Nigerian community
living in Houston, USA [18].
A recent study of malaria mortality among VFRs in
the UK argued that immunity following previous expos-
ure was unlikely to be the only explanation of reduced
severity, as the analysis included travellers born in the UK
(second- or third-generation migrants) who would not
have naturally acquired immunity. One explanation pro-
posed was that VFRs may have a better understanding of
malaria and its dangers, and may recognize the symptoms
early and self-treat or obtain medical treatment quicker
than other types of travellers [5]. This explanation corre-
sponds with the data with the qualitative research findings
on the perceptions and practices of VFRs [11,12,14,15].
VFR use of bite prevention (B) and chemoprophylaxis (C)
While the data suggest that the behaviours and percep-
tions of many VFRs differ to the advice provided by PHE
both in terms of their actions and their perceptions of
the potential consequences should they contract malaria,
there is evidence that many VFRs have a very good know-
ledge of the causes of malaria and the need to avoid being
bitten by mosquitoes to prevent transmission [11,18]. The
ACMP advice on bite avoidance highlights the use of
window and door screens, insect repellents, spraying bed-
rooms with insecticide, and sleeping under bed nets [7]. 
Very few data are available detailing VFRs’ compliance
with personal protective measures, but a recent qualita-
tive study suggests that while all participants were aware
of the need to avoid mosquito bites and most relied on
their hosts to provide accommodation with adequately
screened bedrooms, very few were willing to sleep under
an insecticide-treated bed net [12].
Several studies have found that many VFRs are also
frequently unlikely to comply with PHE advice on the
use of chemoprophylaxis and, in general, chemoprophy-
laxis use among VFRs has been found to be considerably
lower than among other travellers to malaria-endemic
destinations. In a study assessing chemoprophylaxis use
between 1999 and 2006 among travellers diagnosed with
malaria on return from sub-Saharan Africa, only 7% of
VFR travellers reported having used recommended drugs,
compared with 24% of people travelling for other reasons
[19]. Compliance to chemoprophylaxis recorded in mal-
aria cases are not reliable estimates or representative of
travellers practices, so airport surveys of departing passen-
gers are a better snapshot of prophylaxis use. Departing
UK passengers travelling to Nigeria and Ghana, of whom
three-quarters were travelling as VFRs to each country,
were found to have different compliance rates, with 50%
of Nigerians and 82% of Ghanaian travellers reporting that
they were taking chemoprophylaxis [8].  French data on
imported malaria is not categorized by reason for travel,
but where information is available, over 70% of VFR mal-
aria cases had not used chemoprophylaxis [3]. In a study
undertaken in 559 Dutch VFR malaria patients, 86% were
similarly found to be poorly or non-compliant [20].
In the few data that are available, no association has
been found between knowledge among VFRs of the risk
of malaria and the use of chemoprophylaxis. Despite an
accurate understanding of the threat of malaria among
departing Dutch VFR travellers at high risk of malaria
(74%), 27% of them reported no intention of undertaking
risk-avoidance measures [21].  In a separate departure-
lounge survey in The Netherlands, just over half of
the high-risk VFR travellers (54%)  used chemo-
prophylaxis despite an accurate perception of the threat of
malaria [14].
Several authors have suggested that the cost of purchas-
ing malaria chemoprophylaxis is an important barrier to
the wider use of medication by VFR travellers in the UK,
especially for those travelling as a family group, and/or
compared to the low cost of purchasing malaria treatment
should symptoms arise. Using modelling, some studies
have suggested that an improved uptake of chemoprophy-
laxis would occur if their cost was subsidized by health
systems [22,23], but an analysis of subsidized prophylaxis
in the UK found a very marginal benefit in the impact of
imported malaria in VFRs in a borough where subsidized
anti-malaria drugs were available [24].

Difficulties in accessing chemoprophylaxis have also
been reported as a constraint to its use particularly among
VFRs who travel at short notice [10,12],  and a study
among VFRs of Southeast Asian origin found that a belief
in their malaria immunity restricted the uptake of prophy-
laxis in this group [15]. While no single factor has been
identified as being the main driver behind the low use of
chemoprophylaxis, a combination of cost and accessibility,
together with experiences of side effects from previous
drug use, and the cheap and readily available treat-
ments where malaria is endemic appear to contribute
to a perception among some VFRs that the risks posed
by malaria are outweighed by the drawback of chemo-
prophylaxis use [12].
Limitations of the current strategic approach
The mismatch between the threat of malaria as detailed
in the current UK malaria prevention guidelines and the
experiences of VFRs, particularly in their country of ori-
gin, is potentially contributing to low compliance to na-
tional policy recommendations. The epidemiological data
suggest that the current strategy for addressing this gap,
focusing on A (raising awareness) to increase B (bite
prevention) and C (use of chemoprophylaxis) has had
little impact on the rates of imported malaria among
the VFR population over the past ten years. The ABCD
approach is based primarily on a knowledge deficit hy-
pothesis and the assumption that a didactic knowledge
transfer approach, delivering ‘correct’ and ‘appropriately
tailored’ information to VFRs though primary care pro-
viders is the most effective way of changing perceptions
and practices. While it may be important to increase
awareness among VFRs of the potentially fatal conse-
quences of malaria, a key limitation of this approach is,
as many studies have demonstrated, that there is no direct
link between knowledge and behaviour since health be-
haviours are grounded in complex socio-ecological con-
text where there are frequently structural and social
barriers constraining actions [25]. In particular, several
studies have shown that there is no direct association
between perceived risk of malaria and use of chemo-
prophylaxis and compliance with national recommended
preventive strategies [8,14,21]. Furthermore, data from a
recent small qualitative study among VFRs in London,
most of whom were first-generation UK residents, sug-
gests that these participants tended to be dubious about
the management of malaria within the NHS and were
unlikely to view UK primary care providers as trusted
sources of malaria information [12,17]. Two conceptual
frameworks have recently been developed to describe
the complex socio-ecological context within which VFRs
make their malaria decisions [12,14] and both identify key
structural and social factors that are likely to influence
VFR malaria behaviours and affect their willingness and 
ability to comply with the current ABCD strategy. That
is, as the epidemiological data demonstrate, attempting
to raise awareness of the dangers of malaria is an inef-
fective strategy for malaria prevention among VFRs.
The epidemiological and qualitative data presented in
this paper suggest that current policy does not account
for the epidemiological and social context of VFR malaria.
In order to develop more effective strategies to reduce the
burden of malaria among VFRs, incorporating this evi-
dence may be helpful. Additional epidemiological data on
the effect of repeated travel to malaria transmission areas
on the frequency and severity of clinical episodes among
VFRs is needed.
In the meantime, should the current malaria prevention
guidelines for VFRs be amended? Can alternative strat-
egies be created that take a different approach? Should a
separate strategy be developed for VFR travellers, and if
so, how is a VFR defined? Defining a VFR is not straight-
forward and there is no international consensus on a
definition [26].
Potential solutions? Next steps and new strategies
To address these questions alternative strategies might be
considered for the management of the malaria burden
among VFRs. One alternative may be changing the role
of VFR malaria management through the use of standby
emergency treatment (SBET) of malaria, an approach
which has been already been adopted by European pol-
icy makers for travellers to low-risk, malaria-endemic
regions [27]. However, there may be pitfalls and risks in
withdrawing prophylaxis and relying on self-treatment
when travel is to high-transmission countries. For example,
a recent French study where 74% of the participants were
immigrants, described the dangers of self-medication for
malaria, with self-treatment identified as an important
risk factor for travellers developing severe disease (OR
2.9 CI 1.6-5.6) [28]. The consequences associated with
self-management include: inappropriate management of
non-malarial fevers with an anti-malarial; use of poor
quality (counterfeit) drug or sub-optimal dosing when
purchasing medicine from street sellers; the potential
rapid deterioration of patients with falciparum malaria;
and, lack of access to medical supervision should the clinical
condition not improve [29]. On the other hand, no pub-
lished studies exist on the effectiveness of self-treatment
among VFRs and, rather than ignoring the fact that
these practices occur [12,14],  perhaps consideration
might be given to how such practices may be refined to
encourage safe and effective self-management in this
risk group.
An alternative strategy might include the provision of
rapid diagnostic testing and a recognized treatment regi-
men within community-based medical/healthcare settings.
If such a policy were to be implemented it would need to
Page 5
Behrens et al. Malaria Journal (2015) 14:149  Page 5 of 6
be underpinned by effective support structures. Such a
strategy may realistic because of the demographics and
epidemiology of imported malaria in the UK. Around
88% of all imported P. falciparum malaria in 2008, was
reported in London [17], where immigrant communities
are grouped in boroughs often by country of origin [30]
and served by local health services. This ‘clustering’ would
facilitate geographically targeted training of community-
based providers on the recognition, diagnosis and
treatment of malaria and targeted distribution of rapid
diagnostic kits and artemisinin combination drugs to
community based services in ‘high risk’ areas, particu-
larly specific boroughs in London. With such facilities
in place, community-based diagnosis in general-practitioner
(GP) surgeries, urgent and walk-in care centres and
local accident and emergency (A&E) departments could
be set up to provide rapid diagnostics [31] closer to, and
more accessible for the malaria patient. Ambulatory treat-
ment of imported malaria can be managed, in similar set-
tings with excellent outcomes, at home, without the need
for inpatient observation, where individuals are designated
at low risk of complications [31-35].
If consideration were to be given to implementing
guidelines specific to VFRs, then there remains the ques-
tion of whether two different sets of guidelines can exist
in parallel for travellers to the same region who differ by
ethnicity and reason for travel? Having different pre-
ventative policies for different risk groups has a number
of potential consequences. Firstly, health professionals
would need clear guidance on how to decide which pol-
icy suits their traveller. They would need a precise defin-
ition of who constitutes a VFR, the journey risk and,
most importantly, an understanding of the values and
beliefs of the traveller. Secondly, there are cost implica-
tions: decisions would have to be made as to who would
bear the cost and, if it were the traveller, understanding
the influence of costs of standby treatment and diagnostic
kits on uptake. Thirdly, there may be legal implications for
the prescriber (GP, pharmacist, practice nurse) of self-
treatment. Finally, the most challenging is the situation
where a non-VFR traveller, such as an expatriate or busi-
ness traveller, prefers standby treatment rather than taking
chemoprophylaxis. How should a health professional deal
with such a request? In a Dutch study of 604 malaria pa-
tients, the majority being VFRs, full compliance to chemo-
prophylaxis was associated with significantly lowered odds
of developing severe malaria [20]. A policy recommending
no prophylaxis therefore raises the potential of more
frequent fatal malaria cases. The ‘easy option’ of standby
treatment could be a poor and dangerous alternative for
tourists, expatriates and similar groups, but could prove
difficult not to provide if requested by travellers.
To decide on whether a separate policy might reduce
malaria in VFR travellers, more detailed information is 
required on: the likely cost of implementing self-diagnosis
and treatment; the acceptability of diagnosis and treat-
ment within primary or acute/emergency care settings;
user acceptability of this radical alternative to chemo-
prophylaxis; and, the acceptability to health care pro-
viders of having to deal with two policies, one for VFRs
and one for others.
Potential measurable outcomes that could be used to
monitor the effectiveness should parallel guidance on
malaria prevention be implemented to VFRs include:
I. A change in the proportion and/or number of VFR
malaria cases with no increase in deaths;
II. An increase in the number of non-VFR malaria cases
and an increase in deaths.
Conclusion
The epidemiological evidence suggests that the current
guidelines for malaria prevention in the UK are not work-
ing effectively for a specific group of travellers, namely
VFRs. The reasons for this are several and complex but
are influenced by the health beliefs of VFRs and the struc-
tural, social, environmental, and economic context within
which malaria prevention decisions are made. The current
guidelines focus on trying to change awareness of risk
using behaviour change communication strategies with
little attention to the lived experiences of VFRs and the
socio-ecological context of their decision-making. The
reviews’  findings argues for decreasing the burden of
malaria among VFRs, through a different strategy is re-
quired. Altering VFR behaviour and reducing the malaria
burden requires more than a didactic knowledge transfer
approach as is currently advocated and alternative policy
should consider a focus on solving practical issues, includ-
ing self-management of malaria, early diagnosis and rapid
treatment through primary and urgent care centres and
easy access to effective malaria treatments. If new guide-
lines are introduced, research will be critical to ensure
changes are carefully evaluated and their impact measured
to confirm improvement and safety.
