Abstract
Background: New strategies are needed to manage malaria vector populations that resist insecticides and bite
outdoors. This study describes a breakthrough in developing ‘attract and kill’ strategies targeting gravid females by
identifying and evaluating an oviposition attractant for Anopheles gambiae s.l.
Methods: Previously, the authors found that gravid An. gambiae s.s. females were two times more likely to lay eggs
in lake water infused for six days with soil from a natural oviposition site in western Kenya compared to lake water
alone or to the same but autoclaved infusion. Here, the volatile chemicals released from these substrates were analysed
with a gas-chromatograph coupled to a mass-spectrometer (GC-MS). Furthermore, the behavioural responses of gravid
females to one of the compounds identified were evaluated in dual choice egg-count bioassays, in dual-choice
semi-field experiments with odour-baited traps and in field bioassays.
Results: One of the soil infusion volatiles was readily identified as the sesquiterpene alcohol cedrol. Its widespread
presence in natural aquatic habitats in the study area was confirmed by analysing the chemical headspace of 116
water samples collected from different aquatic sites in the field and was therefore selected for evaluation in oviposition
bioassays. Twice as many gravid females were attracted to cedrol-treated water than to water alone in two choice cage
bioassays (odds ratio (OR) 1.84; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-2.91) and in experiments conducted in large-screened
cages with free-flying mosquitoes (OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.63-2.27). When tested in the field, wild malaria vector females
were three times more likely to be collected in the traps baited with cedrol than in the traps containing water alone
(OR 3.3; 95% CI 1.4-7.9).
Conclusion: Cedrol is the first compound confirmed as an oviposition attractant for gravid An. gambiae s.l. This finding
paves the way for developing new ‘attract and kill strategies’ for malaria vector control.

Background
Mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex
(An. gambiae sensu lato (s.l.)) including An. gambiae
sensu stricto (s.s.) and Anopheles arabiensis are among
the most efficient vectors of malaria on the planet
and are responsible for most deaths from this disease

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article 
in sub-Saharan Africa [1]. The most effective way to pre-
vent malaria to date is vector control. The interventions
used to reduce vector numbers primarily target host-
seeking mosquitoes indoors [2,3].  While these inter-
ventions are effective, increasing evidence suggests that
malaria elimination is not achievable by these methods
alone since residual malaria transmission is maintained by
vectors that feed and rest outdoors or feed on animal
hosts [4]. The development of an efficient attract-and-kill
strategy for oviposition site-seeking females could be
one of the novel vector control tools that is urgently
called for [5,6].

To date, there has been little research investigating how
An. gambiae s.l. females find and choose oviposition sites.
It is known that water vapour helps to guide them [7,8],
however, in nature many aquatic sites remain uncolonized
suggesting that some are more attractive to gravid females
than others [9-11].  Recently, the authors found that
mosquitoes were two times more likely to lay eggs in
lake water infused for six days with soil from a natural
oviposition site in western Kenya compared to lake
water alone in two choice egg count cage bioassays.
This preference was lost when the infusion was autoclaved
[12] suggesting that volatile chemicals, rather than visual
cues attracted the mosquitoes. Although a number of
chemicals have previously been proposed as oviposition
semiochemicals for An. gambiae s.s. [13-15], none of these
have been shown to attract gravid females over a larger
distance (more than a few cm) in laboratory, semi-field or
field settings.
Here, volatiles released from autoclaved and unmodified
soil infusions, and the lake water used as control in the
study by Herrera-Varela and others [12] were analysed.
One of the compounds was selected for evaluation in: i)
two choice egg-count cage bioassays to test for preferential
egg-laying; ii) large semi-field systems with free-flying
females to test for attraction over larger distances; and, iii)
under natural field conditions. Through these experiments
the first confirmed oviposition attractant for gravid An.
gambiae s.l is described.
Methods
Volatile collections from soil infusions
All glassware used was first washed with an odourless
detergent (Teepol, general purpose detergent, Teepol
Industries, Nairobi, Kenya) rinsed in water and acetone
and then placed in an oven at 200°C for at least two hours
before use. Volatiles released from lake water, autoclaved
and unmodified six-day old soil infusions were collected
in parallel with behavioural cage bioassays previously
published [12].  All the unmodified infusions elicited
higher oviposition responses than the lake water or
the autoclaved infusion in these bioassays [12]. Infusions
were prepared by mixing 15 L of lake water with 2 kg of
soil sourced from a natural Anopheles breeding site,
located within the compound of the International Centre
of Insect Physiology and Ecology-Thomas Odhiambo
Campus (icipe-TOC) at Mbita, western Kenya (0°26′
06.19″ South; 34°12′53.12″ East; altitude 1,149 m). The
soil was collected and sun-dried for one day prior to
preparation of the infusion. On the day of the experiment
the infusions were sieved through clean pieces of cotton
cloth to remove large debris from the soil. One half of the
infusion was autoclaved at 120°C for 20 minutes and left
to cool to ambient temperatures. Volatiles were collected
on Tenax traps made from GERSTEL-Twister Desorption 
glass liners (GERSTEL, Muelheim an der Ruhr, Germany),
glass wool (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) and 25 mg of
Tenax® TA polymer (60–80 mesh, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA,
USA).  The traps were washed with 3 ml of methyl-tert
butyl ether (MTBE, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany)
the openings covered with polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE)
tape and kept in an oven at 50°C for at least two hours
before use. Dynamic headspace collections were per-
formed from 300-ml aliquots of the three sample types in
500-ml conical borosilicate glass Erlenmeyer flasks with
24/29 sockets (Quickfit® glassware).  Forty-five grams of
sodium chloride (NaCl, ≥99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim,
Germany) were dissolved in all aqueous samples before
volatile collections to improve the release of volatile
chemicals [16,17].  E-flasks were fitted with gas wash
bottle heads and charcoal-filtered air was pumped at
100 ml/minute through the inlet and drawn out at
the same speed through the Tenax trap over 20 hours
after which the traps were stored at −70°C. Empty
bottles sampled the same way served as control for
background compounds. Volatiles were collected in
parallel from empty bottles, lake water and duplicates
of soil infusions (autoclaved and non-autoclaved).
This was repeated over seven rounds.
Analysis of soil infusion volatiles
The gas-chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS)
system consisted of a 7890A GC (Agilent Technologies,
Santa Clara, CA, USA) fitted with a 30-m long HP-5MS
column (Agilent Technologies) with an inner diameter
of 0.25 mm and 0.25 μm film thickness coupled to a
5975C MS (Agilent Technologies) with electronic
ionization set at 70 eV, the ion source at 230°C and the
quadrupole at 150°C. Tenax traps were thermally
desorbed in a GERSTEL thermal desorption unit
(TDU, GERSTEL, Muelheim an der Ruhr, Germany)
initially held at 20°C and then increased at 120°C/minute
to 250°C, the end temperature was held for five minutes.
The volatile chemicals were transferred in splitless mode
to a cooled injection system (CIS) injector fitted with a
Tenax liner (GERSTEL). The CIS injector was held at
10°C during the TDU programme and was then heated at
a rate of 12°C/second to 260°C during which the volatiles
were transferred to the column in a splitless mode.
Helium was used as carrier gas at a pressure of 34 psi.
The temperature of the GC oven was held at 40°C for one
minute and then increased by 4°C/minute to 260°C and
kept there for three minutes.
Heptyl acetate (35 ng, SAFC, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim,
Germany) in Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) was injected
as external standard with each sample. A hydrocarbon
standard with the C8-C20 compounds (10 ng of each in
cyclohexane) was run and used to calculate Kovats reten-
tion indices (RI). GC-MS data from the lake water and soil

infusion samples were compared to those of the empty
bottle controls for each round. All peaks that were present
in the samples (both duplicates for the soil samples) and
had a different retention time and/or mass spectra
compared to the empty bottle control were manually
integrated. Volatiles with a peak-area at least twice as
big in the sample compared to the control were also
included. The peak-area of the control was subtracted
from the peak-area of the sample when a volatile was
present in both chromatograms. The area of each inte-
grated peak was normalized against the area of the external
standard heptyl acetate injected with each sample and
Kovats retention indices (RI) calculated (Additional file 1).
Peaks with similar RI and mass spectra where given the
same compound identification number (ID). Mass spectral
data were compared using to the electronic mass spectral
library, NIST 2008 for a tentative identification.
Identification of cedrol in the soil infusion samples with
authentic standard
The identity of ID 276 was confirmed using an authentic
standard: (+)-cedrol, ≥99.0% sum of enantiomers, GC,
optical activity α20
D 
+ 10.5 ± 1° (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim,
Germany).  The compound was diluted in MTBE to
0.8 mg/ml and 1 μl was injected in a CIS-injector, set to a
splitless mode, held at 40°C for 0.5 minutes and then
heated at a rate of 12°C/second to 260°C. All other GC-MS
parameters were as for the soil infusion samples above.
Standard curve for cedrol
Eight different amounts (0.008, 0.016, 0.032, 0.08, 0.1,
0.2, 0.4, 0.8 μg) of cedrol ≥99.0% (sum of enantiomers,
GC, Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) dissolved in
MTBE were injected in preconditioned Tenax traps in
the TDU unit on the GC-MS system (described above).
All settings and temperature programmes were as described
above for the soil infusion samples. The area of the peaks
was utilized to create a standard curve, which was used to
calculate the amount of cedrol collected in the soil infusion
samples.
Screening of volatile collection samples from field sites
Water samples were collected from 116 natural water
bodies (puddles, pools, ponds, drains, swamps, and pits)
on Rusinga Island, western Kenya (0°24′33.08″ South;
34°10′14.84″ East; altitude 1,377 m),  during the long
rainy season in 2012. Water samples were filtered into
250-ml wide-neck polypropylene bottles (Thermo Scientific,
UK) through a clean piece of cotton cloth to remove large
debris and transported in a cool box to the laboratory. The
samples were transferred into 500-ml E-flasks. Volatiles in
the headspace above the water samples were collected
on polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB)
solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibres (65 μm Stable 
Flex™, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) for 20 hours. A bottle
containing distilled water, stored, transported and sampled
the same way as the field samples, served as control for
background compounds. SPME fibres were analysed
immediately after volatile collection on a GC-MS system
with the same instruments, GC-column and settings as
described above. The GC injector was kept at 250°C in a
splitless mode; helium with a flow of 1.2 ml/minute was
used as carrier gas. The oven temperature programme
started at 40°C for three minutes followed by an increase
of 5°C per minute to 260°C which was held for three
minutes.
The GC-MS files where screened for the main ions of the
four compounds closely associated with the unmodified soil
infusion samples in the principal component analysis
(PCA) (compound IDs 51, 263, 276 (cedrol) and 286). Only
cedrol was found. The amount of cedrol in the field
samples was often close to the detection limit of the
volatile collection method. Hence, all samples with a
peak containing two of the main mass spectra ions of
cedrol (95 and the compound specific 150) at the reten-
tion time that matched cedrol were scored as positive for
the compound.
Mosquito preparation
Laboratory and semi-field experiments were carried out
with insectary-reared An. gambiae s.s. (Mbita strain)
supplied by the mosquito insectaries at icipe-TOC,
Mbita, and reared following standard operating procedures.
Gravid mosquitoes were prepared by selecting 300 female
and 300 male mosquitoes, two to three days old, from their
rearing cages at 12.00 hours and keeping them in
30x30x30-cm netting cages at 25-28°C and 68-75% relative
humidity. To avoid mosquito desiccation, folded cotton
towels, saturated with tap water were placed over the cages.
Mosquitoes were starved of sugar for seven hours before
blood feeding and allowed to feed on a human arm for
15 minutes at 19.00 hours. Afterwards unfed female
mosquitoes were removed from the cages. Mosquitoes
were then provided with 6% glucose solution ad libitum.
This procedure was repeated the following day. Fed female
mosquitoes were kept together with males for two days
after the second blood meal and used on the third day for
experiments (i.e., four to five days after first blood meal).
At 16.30 on the day of an experiment visually presumed
gravid females (enlarged, pale white abdomen) were selected
from the holding cage [12].
Preparation of cedrol solutions for bioassays and field
experiments
Stock solutions of 10,000 ppm cedrol in ethanol were
prepared by adding 150 mg of (+)-cedrol (≥99.0%,
sum of enantiomers, Sigma-Aldrich) to 15 ml of absolute
ethanol (puriss. pa, absolute, ≥99.8% (GC), Sigma-Aldrich).
Page 4
Lindh et al. Malaria Journal (2015) 14:119  Page 4 of 12
Dilutions were made by adding the appropriate amount of
stock solution to lake water. For example, to make a
5-ppm solution of cedrol in water, 3.5 mL of the
stock solution was added to 7 L of lake water; for
each round 2.5 L of this was used for cage bioassays
and 4.5 L for semi-field experiments with free-flying
mosquitoes. The same formulation procedures were
used to create 5-ppm cedrol preparations for all traps
in the field.
Dual-choice cage bioassays to study substrate
preferences
Experiments were done in previously described [12]
make-shift sheds at icipe-TOC (Figure 1A). All experiments
were carried out at ambient conditions of temperature,
humidity (mean daily temperature 27 ± 5°C, relative
humidity 55 ± 10%) and light. Each cage (30x30x30 cm)
had two glass cups (Pyrex®,  100 ml, 70 mm diameter)
covered with a metal ring and filled with 100 ml of
either the control or test water. The control water
was lake water pumped from Lake Victoria, stored in
a settlement tank and drawn from a tap. The test
water was the same water treated with the respective
concentration of cedrol. The position of the test cups
were randomly allocated to one of the four corners of
a cage and alternated between adjacent cages to control
for possible position effect. One control cup was added in
each cage diagonal to the test cup to complete the two
choice set-up. Five treatments were tested in parallel: 
1) two untreated cups of lake water in a cage which
served as the reference group; 2) lake water (control)
versus lake water treated with 2.5 parts per million
(ppm) cedrol (test);  3) control versus 5 ppm test; 4)
control versus 10 ppm test; and, 5) control versus
20 ppm test. Cage experiments were implemented
over 15 rounds with fresh cedrol stock solution and
different batches of mosquitoes for every round. Fifteen to
25 replicate cages per treatment were set up per round.
Cages were set at a minimum distance of 30 cm. A single
gravid female was introduced per cage at 18:00. The next
morning between 08.00 and 09.00 the absence or presence,
and the number of eggs was recorded for the control and
test cup in each cage. Non-responders (mosquitoes that
did not lay eggs) were removed from the analysis.
Semi-field experiments with free-flying gravid mosquitoes
to study attraction and odour discrimination
Experiments designed to evaluate attraction (defined as
the oriented movement of an insect to the source of a
chemical cue from a distance of several metres [18]) of
free-flying gravid female An. gambiae s.s. were done in a
screened semi-field structure (10.8 m long × 6.7 m
wide × 2.4 m high) at icipe-TOC, using modified
BG-Sentinel mosquito traps (Biogents AG, Regensburg,
Germany).  The BG-Sentinel mosquito traps were sunk
into the sand and a plastic container inserted to hold 4.5 L
of aqueous solutions (Figure 1B, [19]). Two traps were set
1.5 m away from the shorter wall of the semi-field system

so that they were 4.5 m apart and equidistant to the
mosquito release point, 9.5 m away towards the opposite
short wall. Treatments were randomly allocated to four
possible corners in a randomized complete block design.
Two-hundred gravid mosquitoes were released per round
over 12 rounds. Mosquitoes were introduced at 18:00,
about five minutes after the BG-Sentinel traps were
started. Gravid mosquitoes that oriented towards either
trap were sucked into a catch bag in the trap.
The peak oviposition time of the caged An. gambiae s.
s. is between 19:00 and 21:30 [8]. To be able to compare
the oviposition response within this time period to the
remainder of the night the catch bags were changed at
21.30 and then collected the next day between 08:00 and
09:00. Two treatments were tested: 1) two traps with
4.5 L lake water, this served as the reference group; 2) 4.5 L
lake water (control) versus 4.5 L lake water with 5 ppm
cedrol (test).
Estimation of release rates of cedrol from bioassay cups
and BG-Sentinel mosquito traps
Cage bioassays and BG-Sentinel mosquito traps were set
up in the same way as during experiments. Tenax traps
prepared and cleaned as above were used to collect vola-
tiles above the oviposition cups and gravid traps. A pump
was used to draw air through the Tenax traps at a speed
of 100 ml/minute. Collections were made 3 cm above the
water surface of untreated lake water and lake water con-
taining 5 or 10 ppm cedrol in the bioassay cups between
17:30 and 08:30. BG-Sentinel traps were set up in the
semi-field system and collections made 5 cm above
the netting covering the trap where the air current
leaves the trap. The BG-Sentinel traps where baited
with untreated lake water or lake water containing
5 ppm cedrol. Tenax traps were changed hourly for
12 hours. Two rounds of samples in duplicates were
taken for cage tests and three for semi-field tests. Tenax
traps were eluted with 200 μL of MTBE containing 20 ng
of β-caryophyllene (≥98.5 sum of enantiomers. Sigma-
Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) as an internal standard.
The samples were analysed using the same GC-MS instru-
mentation, settings and programme as described for
SPME fibres above. The amount of cedrol in the samples
was determined by comparing peak areas to that of the
internal standard and converted to per minute release
rates by dividing with the collection time.
Field assessment of trapping efficiency of wild
mosquitoes with odour-baited gravid traps
Fieldwork was implemented during the end of the long
rainy season in June 2014 approximately 7 km south of
icipe-TOC in Kaugege location. Collecting gravid malaria
vectors has never been done routinely and gravid traps
have only been developed recently [19-21].  Whilst the 
modified BG-Sentinel mosquito traps worked well as
gravid traps in the semi-field system and were therefore
an obvious choice to be taken to the field for comparison
with the semi-field data, they had never been tested under
field conditions prior to this work. Two other novel gravid
traps, a square of electrocuting nets (E-nets) [22] and the
OviART gravid traps [20], had previously been developed
and preliminary field tests had shown that they performed
well in the study area (S Dugassa, pers comm). Therefore,
E-nets and OviART gravid traps were run in parallel to
BG-Sentinel traps in the field to evaluate the effect of
cedrol treatment and trap type on the collection of gravid
mosquitoes. The operating procedures for these devices
have been published in detail elsewhere [19,20,22].
Three study sites in close vicinity to residential houses
and within 200 m of the lake shores were selected. The
sites were separated by between 70 and 500 m. In each
site four trap locations were chosen 10–20 m apart from
each other and 5 m from the nearest house. One out of
the three sites was randomly selected to receive two
squares of E-nets and two OviART gravid traps whilst
the other two sites received BG-Sentinel traps in all
four locations. The different trap types were not set
simultaneously at the same site to avoid a competition
between visual and chemical cues. The OviART gravid
trap and the square of E-nets provide a visual stimulus
with their open water surface whilst the BG-Sentinel trap
relies exclusively on chemical cues released from the trap
with its convection currents. However, the trap types were
rotated randomly through all three sites so that the
OviART gravid trap and square of E-nets were tested in all
three locations. All trapping devices provided artificial
oviposition sites filled with lake water; the BG-Sentinel
trap contained 4.5 L whilst the OviART gravid trap and
the square of E-nets contained 8 L each. At each study site
half of the traps (per type) were treated with 5 ppm of
cedrol whilst the other half remained untreated. Treatment
location per site was allocated randomly in such a way that
each location had received the test treatment twice during
the test round (eight days). Cedrol treatment was done just
before the traps were switched on at 17.00. Mosquitoes
were collected from the traps in the morning at 06.00. All
traps were freshly set up in the afternoon in the same
position for eight days, then the location of the OviART
gravid traps and E-nets were relocated randomly to
another study site. This was repeated twice to ensure
that the alternative traps (OviART and E-nets) were
in each site once (three rounds of eight days).
In order to have an estimate of the mosquito population
density in the area, more established host-seeking vector
collections were implemented weekly in parallel to the
gravid collections from 12 households a minimum of
100 m apart from each other and within 1 to 2 km from
the locations of the gravid traps. Collections were made

indoors in inhabited houses with CDC light traps [23] and
outdoors with cattle baited traps (CBT) [24]. The two
different collection methods were chose to gain a better
estimate of potential malaria vectors with varying feeding
and resting behaviour. Mosquitoes were morphologically
identified to genus level and Anopheles mosquitoes to
species level [25,26].  Molecular tools were used to
identify members of the sibling species of the An.
gambiae complex and the Anopheles funestus complex
following published procedures [27,28].
Statistical analyses
GC-MS data were explored using PCA with supplemen-
tary variables. Only volatiles present in at least four out
of the seven rounds for at least one of the sample
types were included in the analysis. The data was
centred and standardized by volatiles prior to analysis
with Canoco 5 [29].
Dual choice cage bioassays and semi-field experiments
were analysed using generalized linear models with a
quasibinomial distribution fitted to account for overdis-
persion in R statistical software version 2.13 [30].  The
proportion of responses (eggs laid or females trapped)
received by the test cups in cage bioassays or test traps
in the semi-field systems of the experiments with two
different choices were compared with the responses re-
ceived by the test cups/traps in cages/semi-field systems
with two equal choices (lake water in both cups/traps).
It was hypothesized that gravid females presented
with identical treatments respond to both cups/traps
in an approximately equal proportion (p = 0.5).  The
statistical analysis aimed to reveal if the test treat-
ment of interest (e.g.,  increasing concentration of
cedrol) received an increased or decreased proportion
of responses as compared to the lake water only
treatment. The experiment (two-choice, equal choice)
and the round of experiment were included as fixed
factors to analyse their impact on the outcome. Rounds
were not significantly associated with the outcome in
any of the experiments and therefore removed from
the final models.
Field data were analysed using generalized estimating
equations (GEE) in IBM SPSS version 20. Prior to the
final analysis the data was tested for significant between-
group variations in trap location and study area. Only
study area varied significantly and was included in the
final analysis as repeated measure with an exchangeable
correlation matrix. The data fitted a negative binomial
distribution. Treatment and trap type were included in
the model as fixed factors. Interactions were tested but
no significant associations found. All reported means
and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated as
the exponentials of the parameter estimates for models
with no intercept included. 
Ethics
Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the
Kenya Medical Research Institute’s  Ethical Review
Committee (Protocol no. 363 and protocol no.422).
Results
Identification of putative oviposition semiochemicals
Volatile chemicals emitted from autoclaved and unmodi-
fied soil infusions as well as the lake water were sampled
in parallel to behavioural assays and analysed by GC-MS
(Figure 2).  Exploration of the GC-MS data using PCA
indicated similarities in volatile profiles within the repli-
cates of the same sample type but different chemical pro-
files between the treatments (Figure 3). Four compounds
(IDs 51, 263, 276, 283) grouped closely with the unmodi-
fied soil samples. GC-MS data with volatiles emitted from
water samples from natural aquatic habitats situated along
the shores of Lake Victoria in western Kenya were
screened for these four compounds. ID 276 was above the
detection threshold in 62 of the 116 samples whereas none
of the other three compounds was detected. ID 276
was identified as the sesquiterpene alcohol cedrol by
comparison of mass spectral data to the NIST08
library and an authentic standard. Based on its presence in
natural Anopheles oviposition sites and the ease of its
identification, cedrol was selected for further evaluation.
Cedrol was present in all the soil infusion samples
investigated (n = 14 for unmodified and autoclaved
samples combined) and the amount was three times as
high in the unmodified soil infusion (mean 15.8 ng, 95% CI
9.36-22.2), which was preferred for egg-laying in the previ-
ous study [12], compared to the non-preferred autoclaved
infusion (mean 5.7 ng, 95% CI 4.6-6.7). In contrast, it was
only detected in two out of seven lake water samples
(mean of those two samples: 4.2 ng, 95% CI 3.8-4.5).
Cedrol attracts laboratory-reared gravid Anopheles
gambiae s.s. females
A series of experiments was carried out in the laboratory
and semi-field with insectary-reared An. gambiae s.s. to
determine whether gravid females respond to cedrol
(Figures 1 and 4).  The cage bioassays demonstrated a
dose-dependent response of gravid females with increasing
concentrations of cedrol increasing the probability of a
female laying her eggs in the test solution. Interestingly,
the dose–response matched the previously observed
(Figures 4A and B) results for the soil infusions of
increasing incubation time when compared to lake water.
Since these egg-count cage bioassays cannot distinguish
between contact stimulants and long-range attractants [31]
experiments were implemented in a large (174 cu m) semi-
field system using modified BG-Sentinel traps (Figure 1B).
These odour-baited traps allowed to assess the relative
attractiveness of volatiles released from a trap, without the

influence of visual cues or contact stimulants since the
mosquitoes are prevented from seeing or accessing the test
substrate. The experiments confirmed that cedrol was
attractive with 69% (95% CI 66-71%) of released females
collected in the treated trap (Figure 4C).  The response
towards the cedrol-baited trap was consistent and high
from night-to-night with very little variation. Furthermore,
on average 89% (95% CI 84-92%)  of released gravid
mosquitoes were recollected during the choice experiment
when a cedrol-baited trap was present. This was in sharp
contrast (p <0.001) to the experiment where both
traps contained only lake water in which only 34%
(95% CI 29-38%) of the released females were recollected.
The peak oviposition time of the caged An. gambiae
used in this study has previously been determined to be
between 19:00 and 21:30 [8].  In the semi-field experi-
ment 68% (95% CI 57-78%) of the females were collected
during this period, with 74% (95% CI 70-76%) choosing
the cedrol-treated trap over the trap with lake water 
only. However, the response after 21.30 was nearly
balanced, with only a slightly higher proportion of females
collected in the 5 ppm test trap (58%, CI 53-62%).
Volatile headspace collections from both bioassay
systems confirmed that cedrol was released from the test
substrates but not from the controls. Besides the cedrol
peak, no consistent difference was observed in the
chromatograms from test and control treatments
hence, no breakdown products of cedrol were detected.
Oviposition cups treated with 5 ppm cedrol released
8.7 ng/minute (95% CI 5.9-12.7 ng/minute) and those
treated with 10 ppm released 22.8 ng/minute (95% CI
18.0-29.0 ng/minute) during the 12 hours of experiment.
The release rate from the BG-Sentinel traps treated
with 5 ppm cedrol was on average 8.0 ng/minute
(95% CI 5.4-12.0 ng/minute). Cedrol was released at con-
sistent rates over the 12-hour experimental period with no
significant difference (p = 0.293) between the peak
oviposition time (19:00–21:30) and the rest of the night.

Figure 3 Biplot of the GC-MS data from lake water, unmodified and autoclaved soil infusions. The three sample types form distinct
groups, mainly separated by the second principal component. Four compound IDs (51, 263, 276 and 283) group closely with the unmodified
soil samples. Data from seven rounds of each sample type were centred and standardized by the volatile compounds before being subjected
to principal component analysis with supplementary variables. The supplementary variables were the three sample types indicated with WATER
(lake water), AUTO (autoclaved soil infusion) and SOIL (unmodified soil infusions). Each sample is indicated with a letter; W, A or S for lake water,
autoclaved soil infusion and unmodified soil infusion respectively. The number following the letter indicates the round; volatiles were collected in
parallel from samples with the same number.
Cedrol attracts wild malaria vectors
Under natural field conditions a total of 933 female
mosquitoes were collected in 288 gravid trap nights
(12 traps per night for 24 nights);  91% were Culex
species. Of the An. gambiae species complex, only
An. arabiensis were collected in the field sites, representing
4% of the total catch. In addition, a small number (1%) of
the malaria vector An. funestus s.s. were collected. Trap
catches also included 2% of the secondary malaria vector
Anopheles coustani and 2% Aedes species. Traps baited
with cedrol were 3.3 times (95% CIs 1.4-7.9) more likely to
trap a female An. arabiensis than traps containing lake
water only, irrespective of the trap type (Table 1, Figure 5).
However, the three trap types performed differently under
field conditions with more An. arabiensis females caught
in devices that included visual water cues like the
squares of electrocuting nets and the OviART gravid
trap irrespective of site and location (Table 1). Collections
of host-seeking females indoors with CDC light traps and
outdoors with CBTs at the same time confirmed that the
overall population density of vectors in the study area was
low during the study period. In CDC traps a mean of 0.73 
(95% CI 0.28-1.90) and in CBTs a mean of 2.1 (95% CI
1.1-4.0) females of the An. gambiae complex were col-
lected per trap night; 96% of which were An. arabiensis,
confirming the predominance of this sibling species in the
field setting.
Interestingly, the data indicate that An. funestus might
show a preference for cedrol-treated oviposition sites,
however due to the small sample size this result is only
of borderline significance (p = 0.057, Table 1).  On the
contrary, An. coustani,  Aedes species and the abundant
Culex species preferred the untreated traps (Table 1).
Discussion
This study describes the identification of the first ovipos-
ition attractant for malaria vectors of the An. gambiae spe-
cies complex. Caged gravid females selected lake water
treated with cedrol over lake water without cedrol for laying
their eggs. Furthermore, the odorant attracted colonized
free-flying gravid mosquitoes in large semi-field structures
and increased the trap catches of wild gravid mosquitoes in
the field. The attractiveness of cedrol was established in
comparison to natural water from Lake Victoria which

constitutes the majority of the natural, highly productive
anopheline habitats in the study area [32] and which
previously was found “to be the most stimulatory
water treatment [for An. gambiae] uncovered to date”
in egg-count cage bioassays [33].  This comparison is
considered more realistic than one using distilled
water as a comparator, since it is an artificial water
source that wild mosquitoes are unlikely to encounter. It
can though not be excluded that volatile compounds
released from the lake water contributed to the attractive-
ness of cedrol. However, preliminary cage bioassays
(unpublished) implemented with distilled water gave
similar results as those with lake water. 
The recently developed systems of analysing ovipos-
ition responses in comparison to a baseline that provides
two equal, untreated choices [12],  and of measuring
attraction of gravid mosquitoes to oviposition substrates
with modified BG-Sentinel mosquito traps [19] allowed
a more detailed description of the behaviour of gravid
Anopheles in response to odorants, since the response of
individual females could be studied and stochastic effects
affecting the distribution could be estimated and included
in the analyses. It was shown here that cedrol not only
increased the proportion of gravid females that were
caught in the test trap out of the total number caught, but
it also increased the proportion that responded out of the

mosquitoes released. Furthermore, the presence of cedrol
in the system induced a fast response, with two thirds of
gravid mosquitoes trapped by 21:30.
With the ethanol-based cedrol formulation utilized
here, cedrol was released in consistent rates over the
entire 12 hours trapping period each night and therefore
does not explain the nearly balanced response of gravid
females to the traps in the semi-field experiment after
21.30. Less than one third of the collected mosquitoes
were trapped after 21.30. It might be that these specimens
were not fully gravid and therefore responded to high
humidity to locate a resting place rather than to locate an
oviposition site. For future studies, there may be value to
work out better ways to formulate and dispense cedrol.
The fact that it is a stable compound of relatively low
volatility means that it should be well suited for develop-
ment of long-lasting attractive baits.
The field study was implemented in an area of rela-
tively low vector density as confirmed by collections of
host-seeking mosquitoes. Considering that only a pro-
portion of mosquitoes that host seek obtain sufficient
amount of blood and survive long enough to become
gravid, it was not unexpected that collections in gravid
traps were an order of magnitude lower than catches in
host-seeking traps. Despite low densities, it was three
times more likely to trap An. arabiensis (the predominant
species of the An. gambiae species complex in the study
area) when the trap was cedrol-baited than when it only
contained lake water. Previous reports from the study area
show that the two sibling species An. arabiensis and An.
gambiae s.s. share the same aquatic habitats [11,34,35]
and therefore it is not surprising that they appear to
use the same odorants for orientation and selection
of oviposition sites. The collections from the gravid
traps also suggested that it is worth testing the attraction 
of the malaria vector An. funestus to cedrol since a slight
preference for cedrol-treated traps was recorded. Finding
a semiochemical or blend that could attract gravid females
of the three most important vectors of human malaria in
Africa, An. gambiae, An. arabiensis and An. funestus,
would represent a tremendous breakthrough for the de-
velopment of novel interventions. The fact that Anopheles
were caught in an area with very low densities and that
cedrol attracted An. arabiensis, a vector that is becoming
increasingly important in areas where indoor interven-
tions have impacted mosquito densities, indicates a prom-
ising future for the development of an odour-baited
surveillance tool [24,36].
The results presented here confirm that the modified
BG-Sentinel mosquito traps work extremely well under
semi-field conditions but were less effective in the field.
It is hypothesized that visual cues interact with olfactory
signals [37],  explaining the better performance of
traps with open water surfaces in the study. Further
understanding of the interaction between visual and
chemical cues which may result in more effective traps
will increase the possibility to efficiently lure vectors into
oviposition traps when competing with natural oviposition
habitats.
Cedrol-treated lake water, attracted similar proportions
of gravid females in the semi-field experiments as the
soil infusions from which it was identified [19].  To
achieve this, a release rate of cedrol, which was much
higher than from the natural source, was required. A
lower concentration of cedrol might be enough to attract
gravid malaria vectors if released in combination with
other attractants. For instance, blends of synergistic
attractants have been shown to be essential for effective
trapping of host-seeking Anopheles mosquitoes [38-40].
The analysis of the GC-MS data suggests another four

putative semiochemicals, yet to be identified, that may
play a role in the attractiveness of the six-day old soil
infusion to gravid mosquitoes however, in contrast to
cedrol none of these could be detected in the samples
from natural oviposition sites in Kenya.
Cedrol is a sesquiterpene alcohol best known for its
presence in the essential oil of conifers, especially in the
genera Cupressus and Juniperus.  However, it has been
found in a large variety of plants including Sorghum
[41],  Artemisia [42] and swamp grasses of the genus
Cyperus [43],  which are all common in the study area.
Sesquiterpenes are also known metabolites of fungi and
to some extent bacteria [44-46]. It was shown here that
the amount of cedrol released from a soil infusion was
higher than from the same infusion that had been
autoclaved and previously that the oviposition preference
increased with increasing incubation time of the infusion
[12]. This suggests that the release of cedrol is associated
with microbial activity, possibly by metabolism of plant
products. Finding the source of cedrol might further
elucidate why An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis prefer
to lay eggs in habitats containing this compound and
might help predict habitat selection and guide malaria
vector control interventions.
Conclusions
This study provides evidence that gravid females of the
An. gambiae complex can use attractive chemical cues
when orienting towards potential oviposition sites. The
findings demonstrate for the first time that these chemical
cues can be exploited for trapping female malaria vectors.
The discovery of an oviposition attractant provides
prospects for novel ecological studies and is an important
breakthrough in developing ‘attract and kill’  strategies
against gravid malaria vectors. This could provide a novel
tool in targeting residual malaria transmission in areas
where current gold-standard indoor vector control inter-
ventions are applied at full coverage but are not enough to
eliminate malaria [4,6].
