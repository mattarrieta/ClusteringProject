Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that are involved in various biological processes including insect
development. Anopheles stephensi serves as primary vector of malaria parasite in Asia and exhibits holometabolous life
cycle that involves four different stages of development. Regulation and role of mosquito miRNAs during various stages
of mosquito development remain largely unknown.
Methods: High throughput small RNA sequencing was employed for identification and profiling of miRNAs across
immature and adult stages of malaria vector, which were further validated using Northern hybridization and real time
PCR. Target prediction and pathway analysis was carried out to understand the role of regulated miRNAs in insect
development. Degradome sequencing was employed to identify cleaved targets of some regulated miRNAs. Loss of
function strategy was employed for miR-989 to understand its probable role in female reproductive process.
Results: Small RNA sequencing and data analysis revealed 111 and 14 known and novel miRNAs respectively
across all stages of Anopheles stephensi. Nine miRNAs showed gender specific regulation across different stages of
mosquito development. Analysis of miRNAs revealed regulation of 24 and 26 miRNAs across different stages of male and
female mosquito development respectively. mRNA targets and significant pathways targeted by regulated miRNAs were
identified for each stage of mosquito development. Degradome sequencing revealed twenty nine cleaved targets of
insect miRNAs. MicroRNA-989 showed significant up-regulation in the adult female as compared to adult male mosquito.
Knockdown of miR-989 expression in adult female using miRNA specific antagomir affected targets playing roles in
protein binding, proteolysis and nucleic acid binding in ovary tissue of female mosquito post blood feeding.
Conclusions: This is the first comprehensive effort to understand regulation of Anopheles stephensi miRNAs across
developmental stages of male and female mosquito. Preliminary role of regulated miRNAs in mosquito development
was revealed by target prediction and pathway analysis. MicroRNA-989 emerged to have important roles in adult female
mosquitoes showing significant up-regulation which was further studied using miR-989 specific antagomir. This study
provides insights into mosquito development and reproductive process and has implications for effective control of
mosquito population required for reducing spread of mosquito-borne infectious diseases.

Background
Mosquitoes exhibit holometabolous life cycle that pro-
ceeds through four different life stages. Eggs laid by
blood fed female mosquitoes hatch into larvae that
metamorphosis into pupae and finally to imago or adult
mosquitoes. These stages exhibit distinctive morpho-
logical and physiological differences as depicted by their
choice of different ecological niches. After hatching,
larva grows and periodically sheds its old cuticle by the
process of ecdysis. This process results in larval growth
through successive instar to reach fourth instar stage of
development. Larva metamorphosis into pupa involves
almost complete histolysis and phagocytosis of the larval
tissues. Pupa is a non feeding inactive stage during
which reconstruction of histolysed tissue results in for-
mation of organs of an adult mosquito.
Such complete metamorphosis involves complex inter-
play of ecdysteroid and juvenile hormone activities and
regulation of transcriptional events [1,2].
MicroRNAs are non protein coding small RNAs of
length 18–24 nucleotides that are produced by plants, ani-
mals and viruses [3-5]. They regulate numerous biological
processes such as growth and development, differenti-
ation, disease progression, apoptosis and immunity [6].
Such regulation is mediated by miRNA binding to 3’UTR
sequence of target gene and regulating their expression
either by target cleavage or translation repression [7]. Rep-
ertoire of miRNAs in different mosquito species has been
reported [8-10]. Few of them have been functionally char-
acterized and were shown to play critical role in insect
reproduction and immunity against pathogens [11-13].
Few studies have focused on understanding the regulation
of miRNAs across developmental stages of mosquito
[14,15].  Previous studies have identified miRNAs in
An.stephensi and studied miRNA regulation in blood fed
and post Plasmodium infected female mosquito [9,16].
Understanding the regulation of miRNAs across immature
stages of An.stephensi, an important disease vector in Asia
remains largely unfulfilled.
In this study, we employed next generation small RNA
sequencing to identify miRNAs that are regulated across
Anopheles stephensi immature stages. We studied miRNA
differences between male and female mosquito during lar-
val, pupal and adult stages of their development, as differ-
ences between the genders render the female mosquito fit
to serve as vector for parasite transmission. MicroRNAs
differentially expressed during metamorphosis from larval
to pupal and then from pupal to adult stages were identi-
fied. Characterization of these miRNAs may offer insight
into vital processes such as ecdysis, histolysis and gener-
ation of adult organs during mosquito life cycle. Addition-
ally, a number of novel mosquito-specific miRNAs were
also discovered. Further, mRNA targets were predicted to
understand their role in mosquito development. Antagomir 
injections and degradome sequencing were employed for
the first time in insects to identify mRNA targets cleaved
by regulated miRNAs in ovary tissue of female mosquito.
Ovary specific cleavage of targets highlights towards their
role in insect reproduction. Understanding the functions of
these regulated miRNAs will provide useful insights in
mosquito biology and is capable of deciphering ways to
control mosquito-borne infectious diseases.
Methods
Ethics statement
Animal experiments were performed in accordance with
National animal ethics guidelines of the Government of
India after approval by Institutional Animal Ethics Com-
mittees of International Centre for Genetic Engineering
& Biotechnology, New Delhi (Permit number: ICGEB/
AH/2011/01/IR-8).
Rearing of mosquito
All developmental stages of Anopheles stephensi includ-
ing egg, larva, pupa and adult mosquitoes were reared
under optimum temperature at 28 ± 2°C and 70 -75%
humidity in an insectary. Laid eggs were transferred to
the enamel trays and were allowed to hatch into a first
instar larvae. Larvae were fed on fish food and were
allowed to grow from first instar to fourth instar larvae.
Fourth instar larvae transforms into pupae, which were
collected and kept into cloth cages. Emerging adult mos-
quitoes were maintained in same cages and were fed on
water soaked raisins and 1% glucose soaked cotton pads.
To obtain next generation of eggs, 5–6 days old female
mosquitoes were fed for two hours on mice as a source
of blood meal. Female mosquitoes developed and laid
eggs three days post blood feeding in a bowl of sterilized
water.
Sample collection and RNA isolation
Mosquitoes at different stages of their development,
namely fourth instar larvae, pupae and 5–6 days old
adult mosquitoes, with a minimum sample size of 100
numbers in each group for both genders were collected.
The samples were collected a minimum of three times
during different rearing cycles for each stage of develop-
ment. Total RNA enriched in small RNA population was
extracted using miRNeasy kit (Qiagen) as per the man-
ual’s protocol. Total RNA from all biological replicates
were pooled during small RNA library preparation. Col-
lecting samples from different cycles of mosquito rearing
would help in nullifying changes induced by possibly al-
tered rearing conditions and hence served as biological
replicates. Quality and quantity of RNA was checked by
using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA Nano 6000 kit.

Small RNA sequencing library preparation, sequencing
and data analysis
Small RNA libraries were prepared from total RNA ex-
tracted from all six samples viz., male and female fourth
instar larva, male and female pupa and 5–6 days old
male and female adult mosquitoes. Small RNA library
preparation and post sequencing data analysis was car-
ried out as described in [9]. Briefly, Illumina Trueseq li-
braries were prepared by ligating adaptors to both side
of the RNA sequence followed by reverse transcription.
Adaptors ligated fragments were PCR amplified and
were 14–160 bps fragments were purified using 6% TBE
PAGE gel. Prepared libraries were then sequenced using
Illumina Genome Analyzer II.
In-house developed data analysis pipeline was used for
analysing post sequencing raw data as described in [8].
Briefly, raw sequences were filtered and sequences with
length >18 nt were selected. Total number of unique
reads were identified in each library, which were then
aligned against mature miRNA sequence downloaded
from mirbase database using bowtie with zero mismatch
as a parameter [17,18]. Unmatched sequences were used
for novel miRNAs identification. Unmatched sequences
were mapped on to pre-miRNA, ncRNA database [19]
and coding region of genes of different mosquito species
downloaded from vectorbase [20]. Unmatched sequences
were then matched to An.stephensi genome. Matched se-
quences as well as 75 nt sequences flanking on either
side of the mapped sequences were extracted. These se-
quences were folded into secondary structures using
RNAfold [21] and their folding energies were calculated
using RNAplot [21]. Sequences folding into hairpin loop
structure, folding energy < −20 kcal/mol and small se-
quence mapping on the arm of secondary structure were
classified as novel miRNAs [8].
Differential expression of miRNAs and statistical analysis
Total number of reads for each miRNA in all the six
libraries were obtained by using in house Perl script.
Reads were normalised by calculating tags per million of
total RNA reads (TPM) for each miRNA in all the six
libraries. TPM data obtained was then fed into edgeR
module for identification of differentially expressed
genes between different developmental stages. The P
value cut off was performed on the data with the signifi-
cance threshold selected as 0.05. The final set of miRNAs
that were considered to be significantly regulated were
selected on the basis of three criteria, namely, > two
fold change in expression between compared stages,
P value ≤ 0.05, and TPM >10.
Antagomir injections in mosquitoes
Antagomir for miR-989 was synthesized complementary
to mature miRNA sequence with 2’-O-methyl (2’-OMe) 
group at each base and also with 3’  cholesterol group
(Dharmacon, USA).  Scrambled RNA was synthesized
with same modifications and was used as a negative con-
trol. 4–5 days old female mosquitoes were divided into
three batches of 200 mosquitoes each. First batch was
injected with 69 nl of PBS. Second and third batch of
mosquitoes were injected with 69 nl of 100 uM scram-
bled RNA and miR-989 antagomir each. Mosquitoes
were allowed to recover for two days and were fed on
uninfected mice blood. Ovaries were dissected out of fe-
male mosquitoes 24 hours post blood feeding and were
then stored in Trizol at −80°C till RNA extraction.
Knockdown of miRNA expression post injection was
checked by miRNA qRT-PCR.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Expression profiling of miRNAs across three immature
stages in both genders was carried out by quantitative
RT-PCR. Ten ng of RNA was reverse transcribed using
cDNA synthesis kit (Exiqon).  Real time reactions were
set up using 1:80 diluted cDNA, custom miRNA LNA
PCR primer sets (Exiqon) and SYBR green master mix
(Exiqon) following manufacturer’s instructions in ABI
one step detection system. Experiments were conducted
a minimum of two times, with each experiment set up in
triplicates for all developmental stages. 5.8 s rRNA was
used as an endogenous control for miRNA expression pro-
filing. Expression levels were then calculated against adult
female mosquito as a calibrator using 2-ΔΔCT method.
Northern hybridization
Digoxigenin-labelled antisense miRCURY LNA probes
(Exiqon) were used for detection of miRNAs by North-
ern hybridization. 10ug of total RNA isolated from 5–6
days old female mosquito was run using 15% denaturing
polyacrylamide gels (PAGE).  After the run was com-
pleted, gels were stained with ethidium bromide and
RNA quality was checked using transilluminator. RNA
was then transferred to the nylon membrane using semi-
dry transfer apparatus. Nylon membrane with the trans-
ferred RNA was subjected to EDC crosslinking. Crosslinked
membranes were pre-hybridized in a rotating hybridization
oven for 30 min at 37 deg in hybridization buffer. Over-
night hybridization was done in same buffer at 37 deg with
the final concentration of 0.5 nM miRCURY LNA probe
(Exiqon). The membranes were washed twice for 10 min
each in a low stringent buffer (2X SSC, 0. 1% SDS) at RT
and then once in washing buffer (1X SSC) at RT. The
membranes were incubated for 3 h in blocking buffer
(Roche) followed by 30 min incubation with Anti-DIG-
alkaline phosphatase fragment antibody (Roche) in blocking
buffer. The membranes were then washed in DIG washing
buffer at RT for 15 min each and then incubated for 5 min
in development buffer. CSPD substrate (1:100 diluted in
Page 4
Jain et al. Parasites & Vectors (2015) 8:179  Page 4 of 20
development buffer) was applied on to the membranes and
incubated in dark for 10 min. Chemiluminescence signal
was then measured in a Fluorchem machine (Protein
Simple) to detect miRNA on the membrane.
MicroRNA target prediction and identification of enriched
pathways
mRNA targets of miRNAs regulated across developmen-
tal stages were predicted using RNAhybrid software [22].
3’UTR sequence of An.stephensi genes were downloaded
from vector base. Mature miRNA sequence (fasta) and
downloaded 3’UTR sequence were used as input data
files in RNAhybrid. Targets were predicted using follow-
ing parameters (i) Perfect miRNA seed complementarity
with 3’UTR sequence (ii) P value < 0.05 (iii) miR-
NA:mRNA binding energy < −20 kcal/mol. Targets pre-
dicted using these criteria’s were selected for pathway
analysis. Orthologs of these targets present in An.gam-
biae were fetched from vector base. Targets ortholog of
each miRNA cluster were analysed by NIH DAVID re-
source [23]. mRNA targets of miRNA cluster were ana-
lysed using functional annotation clustering with EASE
score of 0.1. Enrichment score for each cluster was calcu-
lated to highlight enriched role of group members in the
given study.
Degradome sequencing for miRNA target identification
Total RNA was extracted from ovaries of mosquitoes
injected with PBS, scrambled RNA and miR-989 antago-
mir as described before. Degradome library construction
and sequencing was performed by LC Sciences (Houston,
USA).  Data analysis was performed in the lab using an
in-house developed pipeline. Raw reads obtained after
sequencing were processed to remove low quality reads.
Adaptor sequences were then trimmed from the raw
reads. Resulting 20–25 nt sequences were selected for fur-
ther analysis. Potentially cleaved miRNA target were iden-
tified using Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends (PAREsnip)
[24]. Degradome sequences, cDNA of An. stephensi down-
loaded from Vectorbase and mature miRNA sequences
were provided as an input to the PAREsnip software.
Target plots (T-plots) were generated showing relative
abundance of fragments mapping at the miRNA target
site relative to the abundance of fragments found at
other sites on the transcript. Depending on this, identified
targets were grouped into five categories. In category 0,
maximum number of degraded sequences (>1) were
present at one site on the transcript. In category 1, two or
more sites were present on the transcripts where degraded
sequences (>1) map with the same abundance. If abun-
dance at a site was less than maximum but greater than
median abundance for the transcript, target was classified
as category 2. In category 3, abundance at a position was
less or equal to the median value for that transcript. 
Category 4 was classified with only one raw read at the
position.
Results
MicroRNA dynamics was studied during metamorphosis
of both male and female An.stephensi mosquito. Six
small RNA libraries enriched in miRNAs were con-
structed from larva male (LM), larva female (LF), pupa
male (PM), pupa female (PF) adult male (AM) and adult
female (AF) mosquitoes. Constructed libraries were se-
quenced using sequencing by synthesis technology,
(Illumina Inc.). Raw data generated for all six libraries
was analysed using in-house data analysis pipeline [8].
Deep sequencing of small RNA libraries
Sequencing by synthesis of six different libraries yielded
7.2 × 107 raw reads. After adaptor trimming, total of
5.9 × 107 reads remained for further analysis (Table 1).
Size distribution of reads was studied in each library.
Size distribution of reads in each library showed two dis-
tinct peaks. One was observed at 20–23 nt correspond-
ing to miRNAs and another at 32–35 nt representing
piRNA like small RNAs (Figure 1). A total of 3.3 × 106,
2.3 × 106, 4.0 × 106, 6.7 × 106, 9.6 × 106 and 2.8 × 106
reads were found to lie between size range of 18-30 nt
in LM, LF, PM, PF, AM and AF respectively. These se-
quences were mapped on to the known miRNA database
for miRNA identification in various developmental stages
of An. stephensi (Table 1).  Unmatched sequences were
mapped on the ncRNA database and coding sequences
from different mosquito species (Table 1). The remaining
unmatched sequences were used for novel miRNAs
identification.
Complete repertoire of miRNAs in immature and ma-
ture stages of An.stephensi 18-30 nt length sequences in
each of the libraries were mapped on to known miRNA
sequences fetched from mirbase database. A total of
4.9×106 reads from all six libraries mapped with 100%
match with known miRNA sequences from eight differ-
ent insect species (Table 1). After removing mapped re-
dundancy, 111 total known miRNAs were identified
across all stages of An.stephensi. Maximum and mini-
mum number of known miRNAs were identified in AM
(n = 109) and LF (n = 70) respectively (Table 2). Remaining
stages LM, PM, PF, AF contained 85, 104, 106 and 101
known miRNAs respectively. Sixty nine miRNAs were
expressed in all the stages of development of the mos-
quito. Remaining 42 were absent in one or more develop-
mental stages of the mosquito (Table 2). Many miRNAs
were absent in larval stage of mosquito although they
showed expression with TPM >10 in other stages of de-
velopment. Five miRNAs (miR-1891, miR-190-3p, miR-
285, miR-988-3p and miR-989) were not expressed in
both male and female larva. Whereas nine miRNAs

were found absent only in female larva. Out of these
111 miRNAs, three miRNAs namely miR-8-3p, miR-
bantam-3p and miR-281-5p were found most abundant
in developmental stages. MicroRNA-8-3p was the most
abundant miRNA in larval stages of the mosquito while
bantam-3p was most abundant in both male and female
pupal stages of development. Most abundant miRNA in 
AM and AF was miR-281-5p and miR-bantam-3p respect-
ively (Table 2). Differential expression of known miRNAs
between the genders and during metamorphosis is de-
scribed in following sections of the manuscript.
Several novel miRNAs were identified using high
throughput deep sequencing data in adult mosquito.
Novel miRNAs identified in adult female mosquito were
reported previously [9].  In this study, we focused on
identification of novel miRNAs in adult male mosquito.

Their expression was then checked in other stages of
mosquito development (Table 3).  Fourteen small RNA
sequences folded into a perfect hairpin structure with
folding energy < −20 kcal/mol (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Seven of these were present on 5’ arm of the precursor and
hence were annotated as miR-5p whereas rest seven se-
quences were present on 3’arm and were annotated as
miR-3p. Nomenclature of these novel miRNAs was given
in a specific order (Table 3). Novel miRNA sequences were
blasted against known miRNAs in mirBase database. These
sequences did not show similarity with any of the known
miRNAs indicating towards identification of novel class of
miRNAs in mosquito.
Validation of known miRNAs by Northern hybridization
MicroRNAs identified by small RNA sequencing was
verified by northern hybridization. Total RNA from
sugar fed female mosquito was probed using locked nucleic
acid (LNA) probes (Exiqon) for representative miRNAs.
Expression of eight miRNAs namely miR-277, miR-14,
miR-34, miR-285, miR-13b-3p, miR-989, miR-1174 and
mir-219 was validated in An.stephensi (Figure 2). Out of
these eight miRNAs, miR-277 and miR-14 were highly
abundant in female mosquito with reads more than 2×104.
Hence, these two miRNAs showed distinct and specific 
band in northern hybridization. Two MicroRNA miR-285
and miR-219 were low abundance miRNAs with reads less
than 25 in female mosquito. Nevertheless, such low ex-
pressing miRNAs was detectable by specific LNA based
probes in the mosquito (Figure 2) thereby validating the
sensitivity of this assay.
Differential expression of miRNAs across different stages
of mosquito development
To study differential expression of miRNAs, tags per
million (TPM) of individual miRNAs was calculated in
all the six libraries. MicroRNAs with TPM >10 in any of
the developmental stages were subjected to EdgeR analysis.
Regulation of miRNAs was studied between two develop-
mental stages and miRNAs showing fold change >2 with
P value ≤ 0.05 were classified as differentially expressed.
Heat map of all known miRNAs is shown in Figure 3. A
total of 36 miRNAs were found differentially expressed
between different stages of mosquito development.
Gender regulated microRNAs
We studied difference in miRNAs expression between both
genders during larval, pupa and adult mosquito stages.
Minimum number of miRNA differences was identified
during larval stages as it is the early stage of mosquito life

Figure 2 Northern hybridization based detection of mosquito miRNAs. 10ug total RNA from adult female was used for detection of (A) miR-13b,
(B) miR-277, (C) miR-285, (D) miR-989, (E) miR-14, (F) miR-1174, (G) miR-34 and (H) miR-219 via DIG based Northern hybridization. Ladder was run along

cycle. Only two miRNAs namely miR-184b and miR-1175-
5p were significantly down-regulated in female larvae when
compared with male larvae (Additional file 2: Figure S2).
Both genders during pupa stage showed difference in the
expression of three miRNAs. MicroRNA-285 was down-
regulated whereas miR-190-3p and miR-184b were up-
regulated in female pupa as compared to male pupa stage
(Additional file 2: Figure S2).  Maximum differences in
miRNA expression between genders were observed during
adult stages of the mosquito. Only one miRNA miR-989
was found significantly up-regulated in adult female mos-
quito when compared to male mosquito. Whereas, five
miRNAs namely miR-2c, miR-285, miR-219, miR-7 and
miR-2765 were found down-regulated in female compared
with male mosquito (Additional file 2: Figure S2).
MicroRNA regulation during metamorphosis of male
mosquito from larval to pupa and to adult stages
MicroRNA regulation was observed during transition of
male mosquito from larva to pupa stage and during 
metamorphosis from pupa to adult stage of mosquito life
cycle. Many miRNAs were found differentially expressed
during these two transition phases. Seven miRNAs (miR-
2c, miR-375, miR-7, miR-1175-5p, miR-263a, miR-1174
and miR-34) were down-regulated whereas cluster of
seven miRNAs (miR-100, miR-193, miR-1-3p, miR-1890,
miR-277, miR-989 and miR-285) were up-regulated in
pupa stage when compared to the larval male mosquito
(Additional file 3: Figure S3). Metamorphosis from pupa
to adult stage also resulted in differential expression of
miRNAs. We identified seven miRNAs (miR-10-5p,
miR-219, miR-2c, miR-210-3p, miR-190-3p, miR-34 and
miR-1891) up-regulated in male adult mosquito when
compared to pupal stage (Additional file 3: Figure S3).
Transition to adult mosquito resulted in down-regulation
of eight miRNAs namely miR-2765, miR-193, miR-282,
miR-989, miR-2a-5p, miR-9a, miR-1890 and miR-965
(Additional file 3: Figure S3). Out of these regulated miR-
NAs, five miRNAs are of significant importance as they
showed differential expression during larval to pupa as

well as during pupa to adult metamorphosis. Two micro-
RNAs, miR-2c and miR-34 were down-regulated from lar-
val to pupa transition whereas its expression increases
again in adult stages. Three miRNAs, miR-193, miR-1890
and miR-989 were up-regulated in pupa stage. Their ex-
pression down-regulates in adult male mosquito when
compared to its pupa stage (Additional file 3: Figure S3).
MicroRNA regulation during metamorphosis of female
mosquito from larval to pupa and to adult stages
Regulation of miRNAs was also observed during metamor-
phosis of female mosquito from larva to pupa and to adult
stages of development. Eight miRNAs (miR-1-3p, miR-let-
7, miR-277, miR-133-3p, miR-285, miR-193, miR-998 and
miR-184b) were up-regulated in pupa female when
compared to larva female mosquito (Additional file 4:
Figure S4). Another set of eight miRNAs (miR-7, miR-
263a, miR-375, miR-317, miR-34, miR-1174, miR-315
and miR-993-3p) were found down-regulated in pupa fe-
male compared with larval female mosquito (Additional
file 4: Figure S4). Metamorphosis of female pupa to adult
also resulted in differential expression of miRNAs. We 
identified eight miRNAs (miR-927-5p, miR-375, miR-980,
miR-989, miR-210-3p, miR-317, miR-34 and miR-1891)
up-regulated in adult female mosquito compared to pupa
stage (Additional file 4: Figure S4). A set of eight miRNAs
(miR-2765, miR-2c, miR-1-5p, miR-193, miR-282, miR-
2944a-5p, miR-285 and miR-9a) were down-regulated in
adult mosquito when compared with pupa female mos-
quito (Additional file 4: Figure S4). Five miRNAs were dif-
ferentially expressed in all developmental stages of female
mosquito. Two miRNAs, miR-285 and miR-193 were up-
regulated in pupa stages whereas gets down-regulated in
adult stages. Three miRNAs namely miR-375, miR-317 and
miR-34 were down-regulated in pupa female whereas adult
stage resulted in up-regulation of these miRNAs when
compared to pupa stage (Additional file 4: Figure S4).
Validation of miRNA expression profiling by real-time PCR
Differential expression of miRNAs across immature and
mature stages in both male and female mosquitoes was
validated by qRT-PCR. Two miRNAs, miR-989 and miR-
219 were up-regulated in adult female and adult male
mosquito respectively when compared to other stages of
Page 13

development (Figure 4A and B).  Significant down-
regulation was observed for miR-277, miR-210 and miR-
285 in larval stages compared to pupa and adult stages
of mosquito (Figure 4C, D and H).  MicroRNA-34 was
down-regulated in male and female pupa compared to
larva and adult mosquito (Figure 4E).  MicroRNA-1174
expression was down-regulated in both genders of pupa
stage and male mosquito (Figure 4F).  MicroRNA -9a
was the only miRNA that showed up-regulated expres-
sion in larva and pupa stages when compared to adult
mosquito (Figure 4G).  Similar expression pattern of
miRNAs was observed in small RNAs sequencing and
real time data analysis, thereby validating our analysis.
MicroRNA target prediction using RNA hybrid and
degradome sequencing
Regulation of gene expression is brought about by bind-
ing of miRNAs on 3’UTR sequence of the target genes
and in silico analysis for identifying miRNA binding re-
gions could be employed for better validation [25].  In
the present study, we employed bioinformatic analysis 
and in vivo assays to identify targets of regulated miR-
NAs. Targets binding to miRNAs were predicted first by
identifying miRNAs seed binding sites on 3’UTR of An.
stephensi genes using RNAhybrid. Further, degree of
binding complementarity determines the mechanism of
target regulation, either by mRNA cleavage or by transla-
tional repression. As ovary is an important organ for in-
sect reproduction, we aimed to identify mRNAs cleaved
by miRNAs in ovary tissue of blood fed female mosquito
by degradome sequencing.
Target prediction of differentially expressed miRNAs and
enriched pathway analysis
Targets of miRNAs regulated in gender-specific manner
and during metamorphosis from larva to pupa and to
adult stages in both genders were predicted using RNAhy-
brid (P value < 0.05). mRNA targets were predicted for 36
miRNAs that were regulated during different stages of
mosquito development (as described above) (Additional
file 5: Table S1). Maximum number of targets were identi-
fied for miR-34 (n = 524) whereas minimum targets were

predicted for miR-190-3p (n = 24).  Orthologs of all the
mRNA targets known in An.gambiae were retrieved from
vector-base. MicroRNAs were divided into five clusters
depending upon developmental stage at which they were
found differentially expressed. MicroRNAs that showed
gender differential expression during adult stage were
grouped as a cluster. MicroRNAs regulated between the
developmental stages in both genders were analysed sep-
arately (Table 4). Orthologs of target genes known in An.
gambiae were retrieved from vector base and analysed
using functional annotation clustering tool of DAVID re-
source. Analysis was carried out using An.gambiae gene
IDS as An.stephensi database is not linked to the DAVID
resource. Annotation term groups playing more enriched
role in present study were identified. Targets of miRNAs
showing gender differential expression were analysed
which resulted in identification of five enriched annotation
clusters. These clusters were involved in cellular polysac-
charide biosynthetic process, chaperone, hexose metabolic
pathway, heme binding and phagocytotic pathways
(Table 4). Targets of miRNAs regulated from larva to pupa
stage in male mosquito were enriched in genes functional
in phagocytosis and membrane organization, polysacchar-
ide metabolic process, protease activity, peptidase activity
and nuclear transport. Female larva to pupa metamor-
phosis involved genes functional in enriched pathways
such as endocytosis, polysaccharide metabolic process,
cell-redox homeostasis, peptidase and amino acid meta-
bolic pathway (Table 4). Transition of pupa to adult male
mosquito is mediated by enriched pathways such as gelso-
lin–actin binding protein, polysaccharide biosynthetic
process, zinc finger, vesicle mediated transport, protein
biosynthesis, translation, vitamin and cofactor binding,
nucleoside binding, protein catabolic process and insect
pheromone /odorant binding protein phBP (Table 4). In
female mosquitoes, pathways functional in phagocytosis,
cellular carbohydrate biosynthetic process, protein biosyn-
thesis, vitamin binding, cyclin, golgi membrane, ATP
binding, hydrolase activity and transcription were enriched
during pupa to adult metamorphosis (Table 4).
Target identification using antagomirs and degradome
sequencing
Loss of function strategy was employed for identification
of miRNA targets in ovary of female mosquito. PBS,
scrambled RNA and miRNA specific antagomirs were
Nano-injected in female mosquito. RNA was extracted
and subjected to degradome sequencing. Degradome li-
braries were constructed from ovary tissue of PBS,
scrambled RNA and miR-989 antagomir injected mos-
quitoes respectively dissected at 24 hours post blood
feeding. Analysis of data from PBS injection revealed
cleaved products of several miRNAs identified in our
study (Data not shown).  We restricted our analysis to 
those significantly regulated miRNAs between the
genders, namely, miR-2c, miR-285, miR-219, miR-7,
miR-989 and miR-2765. These miRNAs showed distinct
regulation in their expression pattern between the two
genders at their reproductively active mature stages.
Such difference in expression between the genders high-
lights their role in reproductive processes. mRNA targets
of these miRNAs were identified by sequencing the
degraded mRNA due to miRNA cleavage using PARE
sequencing. Cleaved targets were identified for four
miRNAs (miR-285, miR-219, miR-989 and miR-7).
Twenty nine mRNAs cleaved by these miRNAs as
visualised by target plots were identified in ovary of
female mosquito. mRNAs (n = 6) were cleaved by miR-
219 and miR-7 whereas miR-285 cleaved only one
mRNA in ovary tissue of female mosquito (Table 4).
Maximum number if targets were found to be cleaved
by miR-989 (n = 16).
In an attempt to validate these targets and to under-
stand the role of miR-989 in mosquito reproduction, ex-
pression of miR-989 was knocked down by injecting
miR-989 specific antagomir in female mosquito. Four
fold decreases in miRNA expression was observed in
antagomir injected tissue compared to PBS and scrambled
injected ovaries (Figure 4I). Of the sixteen mRNAs that
were found to be cleaved in the ovary of PBS injected
mosquitoes, ten mRNAs were found regulated in miR-989
antagomir injected ovaries (Table 5). Four of the cleaved
targets (ASTE002227, ASTE008381, ASTE003701 and
ASTE005749) were also predicted as miR-989 targets
by RNAhybrid (Table 5).
Out of 29 total targets cleaved by all six miRNAs, 19
were classified under category 4, one under category 3,
seven under category 2 and two targets were classified
under category 0. None of these targets were classified
under category 1. T-plots of targets falling under cat-
egory 2, 1 and 0 are shown in Figure 5. GO terms of
these targets are provided in Table 5.
Out of 29 targets identified, GO term name were iden-
tified for 14 mRNAs (Table 5).  GO terms of these
mRNAs were enriched in pathways related to protein
binding and proteolysis. These targets might be import-
ant for insect reproduction as protein deposition in the
ovary results in maturation of the developing egg. An-
other GO term significantly represented in this cluster
of targets was related to nucleic acid binding. Nucleic
acid binding might be responsible proper transcription
and translation of genes required for maternal to zygotic
transition in developing eggs.

malaria spread, few of which were directed towards con-
trolling the expansion of vector population. Such strat-
egies require detailed understanding of mosquito biology
pertaining to its developmental stages. Mosquito being a
holometabolous insect goes through four stages of devel-
opment. All four stages show characteristic morpho-
logical and physiological differences, resulting from
differential gene expression at each stage of develop-
ment. To understand molecular mechanisms mediating
such differences, we studied the stage specific differences
in miRNA expression which are known regulators of
gene expression.
In this study, we employed deep sequencing technol-
ogy to identify miRNAs expressed during mosquito de-
velopment. Many of the 111 known miRNAs were same
as those identified in our previous study [9]. Nevertheless,

few more known miRNAs were added to the list that were
not identified earlier in blood fed and parasitized mos-
quito [9].  Three microRNAs (miR-8, miR-bantam and
miR-281) were abundantly expressed across all develop-
mental stages of development indicating house-keeping
function of these miRNAs. In Drosophila,  miR-bantam
functions in maintaining circadian rhythm and controls
cell proliferation [26,27]. MicroRNA-8 regulates PI3K ac-
tivity in larval fat boy and controls apoptosis/neurodegen-
eration in insects [28,29]. MicroRNA-281 was shown to
be involved in regulating dengue virus replication in Aedes
albopictus [30]. Efforts were also taken to identify novel
mosquito-specific miRNAs in An. stephensi. Seven pairs of
small RNA reads (−5p and -3p) fulfilled set criteria’s to be
classified as mature miRNAs [31].  Expression values of 
each miRNA in all six libraries were normalised and TPM
vales were compared to study miRNAs regulation across
mosquito developmental stages. Understanding the differ-
ences between male and female mosquito is the most
significant as these differences make female mosquitoes fit
for reproduction and parasite transmission. Therefore, we
identified miRNAs that were differentially regulated be-
tween genders during larval, pupal and adult stages of
development. Few miRNAs were differentially expressed
between genders during larval and pupal stages as these
stages are early stages of development and differences be-
tween genders are not very apparent. On the other hand,
six miRNAs were found differentially expressed between
male and female adult mosquito. Out of these six miR-
NAs, miR-989 was of significant importance as it was

reported to get abundantly expressed in ovary of female
mosquito [16]. Its expression levels were up-regulated in
female mosquito post blood feeding indicating towards its
role in mosquito reproduction [9]. Two microRNAs, miR-
989 and miR-7 also showed gender difference expression
in Anopheles anthropophagus [14].
This is the first extensive study wherein efforts were
taken to understand miRNA regulation during complete
metamorphosis in male and female mosquito. Micro-
RNA differences were studied during larva to pupa tran-
sition and from pupa to adult metamorphosis in both
male and female mosquito. Larva undergoes molting or
ecdysis resulting in its growth and development from
first to fourth instar larva. Histolysis and phagocytosis of
larval tissues results in larval transition to pupa stage.
Many miRNAs were found differentially expressed be-
tween these two stages. Few miRNAs were common in 
male and female metamorphosis from larva to pupa
stage. While, few miRNAs regulated differently during
male and female metamorphosis were identified. The
role of few of these regulated miRNAs has been shown
in Drosophila. Let-7 was required for neuromuscular re-
modeling and temporal organization during metamor-
phosis [32,33].  Another regulated miRNA, miR-7 was
involved in notch signalling and photoreceptor differen-
tiation in Drosophila eye [34,35].  Metamorphosis of
pupa to adult mosquito involves tissue lysis and re-
organization resulting in formation of adult organs. This
process involves complex interplay between molecular
factors as indicated by significant number of miRNAs
found regulated during pupa to adult mosquito meta-
morphosis. MicroRNA-989 was identified up-regulated
in female mosquito whereas it was down-regulated in
male mosquito during the transition. It was found
Page 18

specifically up-regulated in female mosquito when com-
pared to other stages of mosquito development. Such
observation highlights its function in physiological activities
related specifically with adult female mosquito. Regulated
miRNAs such as miR-34 and miR-9a were involved in vari-
ous processes involved in insect development [36-39].
Development of complex organisms requires con-
trolled balance between mRNA degradation and transla-
tion. This fine balance is maintained by many factors
including miRNAs. To understand the role of regulated
miRNAs in mosquito development, it is necessary to
identify their mRNA targets. As miRNAs binds to
3’UTR of targets sequence and regulate their expression,
efforts were taken to identify miRNA seed binding sites
on 3’UTR sequence of An. stephensi genes. Many targets
of each miRNAs were identified using RNA hybrid. Tar-
gets of miRNA regulated at specific stage were analysed
together and enriched annotation clusters playing signifi-
cant role at specific stage of development were identified.
Pathways involved in metabolic processes, phagocytosis
and membrane organization were found enriched during
larval to pupal transition. These pathways might be im-
portant for histolysis and phagocytosis of larval tissue
which results in its transition to pupal stage. Metamor-
phosis from pupal to adult stage involves pathways such
as vesicle mediated transport, phagocytosis, protein and
polysaccharide biosynthetic processes. Genes functional
in translation and enzymatic activity were also found
enriched during mosquito metamorphosis. These path-
ways clearly are required for pupa tissue re-organization
and re-formation of adult mosquito organs.
In our study, we identified miRNAs that were differen-
tially expressed in male and female adult mosquitoes.
Several studies have emphasised the role of some of
these regulated miRNAs in female mosquitoes especially
upon blood feeding [9,16]. In an attempt to identify tar-
gets of miRNAs regulated in our study that could have a
possible role in female mosquitoes, ovary tissues were ana-
lysed upon blood feeding to identify targets, which could
further be studied using miRNA specific antagomirs. This
will be helpful to elucidate miRNA biological functions
in an organism [12,25]. In this study, we inhibited miR-
989 expression by injecting antagomir in mosquitoes.
MicroRNA-989 up-regulates in female mosquito com-
pared to male mosquito. Its expression further increases
in ovary tissue of mosquito post blood feeding highlight-
ing towards its significant role in mosquito reproduction
[16]. Inhibition of miRNA expression via antagomir was
combined with degradome sequencing to identify and
validate miR-989 targets in ovary of blood fed female
mosquito. Cleaved miRNA targets have been identified
in plant kingdom using degradome sequencing [40,41].
This is the first report to have used degradome sequencing
for miRNA targets identification in insects. Degradome 
sequencing has been employed mainly for identification of
miRNA targets in plants as these miRNAs bind to their
target sequence with perfect complementarity resulting
in their cleavage [40,41].  Therefore, we identified very
few cleaved targets in mosquitoes as miRNAs in animal
kingdom generally regulate gene expression by mRNA
translational repression. Targets were identified in ovary
tissue of mosquito by degradome sequencing for miRNAs
differentially expressed between both genders. Differen-
tially expressed miRNAs resulted in regulation of twenty
nine targets by mediating their cleavage in ovary of female
mosquito. Many targets have GO term related to protein
binding and proteolysis which might be important for egg
development that requires massive protein deposition in
developing embryo. Also targets with GO term related to
metabolic processes, nucleic acid binding and signal trans-
duction were identified. Functional characterizations of
these targets are underway to understand their role in
mosquito developmental processes. Deciphering function
of many cleaved targets identified in ovary tissue would
provide us with a better idea about their role in mosquito
reproduction.
Conclusions
In conclusion, this study provides comprehensive ac-
count of miRNA regulated across different stages of
mosquito development. Efforts were taken to understand
targets of these miRNAs which can provide better un-
derstanding of their biological function in mosquito de-
velopment. Identification of miRNA targets in ovary of
blood fed female mosquito could provide insights in
mosquito reproductive process and has implications for
effective control of mosquito population required for re-
ducing spread of mosquito-borne infectious diseases.
