Abstract
Background: Insecticides are widely used to control malaria vectors and have significantly contributed to the
reduction of malaria-caused mortality. In addition, the same classes of insecticides were widely introduced and used
in agriculture in Benin since 1980s. These factors probably contributed to the selection of insecticide resistance in
malaria vector populations reported in several localities in Benin. This insecticide resistance represents a threat to
vector control tool and should be monitored. The present study reveals observed insecticide resistance trends in
Benin to help for a better management of insecticide resistance.
Methods: Mosquito larvae were collected in eight sites and reared in laboratory. Bioassays were conducted on the
adult mosquitoes upon the four types of insecticide currently used in public health in Benin. Knock-down resistance,
insensitive acetylcholinesterase-1 resistance, and metabolic resistance analysis were performed in the mosquito
populations based on molecular and biochemical analysis. The data were mapped using Geographical Information
Systems (GIS) with Arcgis software.
Results: Mortalities observed with Deltamethrin (pyrethroid class) were less than 90% in 5 locations, between 90-97%
in 2 locations, and over 98% in one location. Bendiocarb (carbamate class) showed mortalities ranged 90-97%
in 2 locations and were over 98% in the others locations. A complete susceptibility to Pirimiphos methyl and
Fenitrothion (organophosphate class) was observed in all locations with 98-100% mortalities. Knock-down resistance
frequencies were high (0.78-0.96) and similar between Anopheles coluzzii, Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles arabiensis, and
Anopheles melas. Insensitive acetylcholinesterase-1 was rare (0.002-0.1) and only detected in Anopheles gambiae in
concomitance with Knock-down resistance mutation. The maps showed a large distribution of Deltamethrin resistance,
Knock-down mutation and metabolic resistance throughout the country, a suspected resistance to Bendiocarb
and detection of insensitive acetylcholinesterase-1 from northern Benin, and a wide distribution of susceptible
vectors to Pirimiphos methyl and Fenitrothion.
Conclusion: This study showed a widespread resistance of malaria vectors to pyrethroid previously located in
southern Benin, an early emergence of carbamates resistance from northern Benin and a full susceptibility to
organophosphates. Several resistance mechanisms were detected in vectors with a potential cross resistance to
pyrethroids through Knock-down and metabolic resistance mechanisms.

Background
For malaria vector control intervention, Indoor Residual
Spray and Insecticide Treated Net are so far the most ef-
fective tools used [1-3].  These two interventions are
based on the use of different classes of insecticide.
Pyrethroid insecticides are considered most suitable for
mosquito nets treatment due to their high insecticidal po-
tency at low dosages and a relative safety for human contact
and domestic handling [2]. They included: Lambdacyhalo-
thrin, Permethrinn, Alpha-cypermethrin, Etofenprox, and
Cylfluthrin [2]. They have a quick knock-down and lethal
effect on Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (An. gambiae s.l)
mosquitoes at low concentrations [3]. The majority of long-
lasting insecticide-treated nets freely distributed in all local-
ities in Benin through mass-distribution campaigns and
routine distributions since 2007 were Deltamethrin and
Permethrin based [4-6].
Bendiocarb was previously used for indoor residual
spray in Oueme province in Benin from 2008 to 2010
(6 spray cycles) and showed a significant reduction in
malaria transmission [7,8]. It is also used for indoor re-
sidual spray in Atacora province each year with one
spray cycle per year since 2011 [9].
But the use of these vector control tools cannot be effi-
cient if their use does not take into account the environ-
mental factors associated with insecticide resistance before
their implementation. Pyrethroids resistance was reported
in several localities in southern Benin since 1999 [10-13]
and represented also a threat for these interventions. In
addition, the lack of baseline data before the implementa-
tion of vectors control intervention in an area needs to be
addressed. For example, the National Malaria Control
Program (NMCP) needs data on the dynamics of in-
secticide resistance in all the epidemiological patterns
of the country, particularly a map on the entomological
situation of Benin, to be used as a guide to the choice
of vector control strategies. This study was developed
in this framework. The study was conducted in eight
randomly selected sites. The eight sites were selected in
the main malaria eco-epidemiological areas of Benin
where geography (climate, land, vegetation and agriculture
practices) and malaria prevalence were different [14].
At each site, the level of vector resistance (Pyrethroids,
Carbamates, and Organophosphates) and the resistance
mechanisms (Kdr-west, Ace-1R and metabolic resistance) in-
volved were assessed. A mapping of the distribution of vec-
tor resistance and vector resistance mechanisms was done.
Data gathered in the different malaria eco-epidemiological
areas will guide malaria vectors resistance strategies in Benin.
Methods
Study design
The study was conducted in each rainy season (April-
July; October-November) in 2012, 2013, and 2014 in 
eight districts randomly selected from different geo-
epidemiological regions in Benin [14]. The selected districts
were:
– Adjohoun, Allada, Pobe, and Ouidah in wet savanna
and degraded forest regions, southern Benin [15-18];
– Kandi and Malanville in dry savanna region,
northern Benin [19,20];
– Dassa in the central part, and Parakou in the north
southern part, are located between the dry and wet
savanna region (transition zone) [21,22].
Atacora region, where indoor residual spray was on-
going, was excluded due to the specific vector resistance
monitoring system implemented in this area, that was
well documented [9,23].
Anopheles gambiae s.l larvae were collected based on
dipping method in four villages randomly selected in
each district, then bred to adult phase (They were
pooled together to have sufficient adult of the same
physiological age by district) and tested with different
classes of insecticides (with around 150 mosquitoes
tested/insecticide/location) using WHO susceptibility
(tube/cylinder) tests guidelines [14].  Mosquitoes tested
were subjected to specific polymerase chain reaction
treatments for species identification, and determination
of resistance mechanism (Kdr-west and Ace-1R).  Geo-
graphic information system was then used to show the
distribution of phenotypic and genotypic resistances
with Arcgis 10.1 software.

climate is South Sudanian-characterized by a rainy season
(May to October) and a dry season (November-April).
The average annual rainfall is 1200 mm. The maximum
occurs from July to September [22] (Figure 1).
Kandi
Kandi (11°4′58.91″N and 2°13′37.60″E) is located in the
center of Alibori County. The climate is North Sudanian
characterized by two distinct seasons: a rainy season from
April to October and a dry season from November to
March. The annual average rainfall varies considerably be-
tween 700 and 1400 mm [19] (Figure 1).
Malanville
Malanville (11°48′49.06″N and 3°22′58.08″E) is located in
the extreme north of Benin in Alibori County. The climate
of Malanville is North Sudanian. The average rainfall turns
around 750 mm [20] (Figure 1).
Mosquito collections
Anopheles gambiae sensu lato larvae and pupae were
collected from natural breeding sites of each district.
Mosquito larvae and pupae collected were kept in sepa-
rated labeled bottles related to each district, transported
to the insectaria and maintained at a relative humidity of
72 ± 5% and a temperature of 28 ± 2°C. An. gambiae s.l
larvae were identified and separated for rearing. Adults
were provided with 10% sugar solution. Unfed An. gam-
biae s.l adults, female aged from 2 to 5 days from each
district were pooled together to have a sizable mosquito
sample (n =150).
Insecticide susceptibility tests
Mosquitoes were assessed using World Health
Organization discriminating dosages with four insecti-
cides: 0.1% Deltamethrin, 0.1% Bendiocarb, 0.25%
Pirimiphos méthyl, and 1% Fenitrothion. 20–25 unfed
females were exposed to the diagnostic doses of in-
secticide treated papers for 60 min at 27 ± 1°C and
80% relative humidity. Exposed mosquitoes were intro-
duced into each tube and inspected at different time inter-
vals (10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60 minutes), ‘Immediate mortality’
(0.1% Bendiocarb, 0.25% Pirimiphos méthyl, and 1%
Fenitrothion) and “knocked-down” (for 0.1% Deltamethrin)
were recorded. After exposure, mosquitoes were kept
in observation tubes and provided with a 10% honey
solution. Mosquitoes exposed to untreated papers were
used as control. Mortalities were recorded after
24 hours and susceptibility status of mosquito popula-
tions was graded according to the World Health
Organization protocol [24].  Dead and surviving mos-
quitoes from assessments were used for molecular
analysis. 
Species identification and PCR detection of Knock-down
resistance (Kdr) and insensitive acetylcholinesterase-1
(Ace-1R) mutations
Around 48 mosquitoes by site were randomly selected
from live and dead mosquitoes and subjected to Poly-
merase Chain Reaction (PCR) for species identification
[25]. DNA extracted from specimens of Anopheles gam-
biae sensu stricto were subjected to PCR for identifica-
tion of ‘Anopheles coluzzii’ and ‘Anopheles gambiae’ [26].
The Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment
Length Polymorphism diagnostic test was used to detect
the presence of L1014F mutation (Kdr) according to the
method described by Martinez-Torres et al. [27] and
G119S mutation (Ace-1R) using the method describe by
Weill et al. [28].
Biochemical analysis
Biochemical analysis was performed on 50 mosquitoes
stored at 280 μC within 24 h from emergence from each
district. These mosquito samples were not exposed to any
insecticides prior to biochemical assays. Levels of activity of
mixed function oxidases (MFO), non-specific esterases
(α and β-esterases),  and glutathione S-transferases
(GST) were compared in susceptible An. gambiae Kisumu
and the field populations from each district.
Oxydase activity was assessed using heme-peroxidase
assay to identify the elevation in the amount of heme
according to the method described by Brogdon et al.
[29]. Non-specific esterase activity was measured using
a-naphtol acetate and b-naphtol acetate and final concen-
trations were determined at 550 nm [30]. Glutathione- S-
transferase (GST) activity was measured in mosquitoes
using 200 ml of GSH/CDNB working solution added to
each replicate of mosquito homogenate. The kinetic reac-
tion was read at 340 nm immediately for 5 minutes [30].
Data analysis
World Health Organization criteria [24] were used to
determine resistance status of mosquito population as
follows:
Mortality rate is > 98%: susceptible mosquito
population;
Mortality rates ranged between 90 – 98%: suspected
resistance in the mosquito population;
Mortality rates < 90%: resistant mosquito population
to the insecticide.
Knock-down and Immediate mortality were very low at
10 minutes and were then analyzed from 15 minutes.
Mortality rates of An. gambiae populations were com-
pared using Fisher’s exact test. Allelic frequencies of
L1014F mutation and G119S mutation were analyzed
to assess variability of mutation frequencies across
Page 5

populations. Only Deltamethrin, Knock-down and
Ace-1R resistance data were analyzed for Ouidah due to
several unsuccessful mosquito larvae collections at this site.
All statistical analysis was performed using R 2.15
software.
Results
Effect of Deltamethrin on mosquitoes
The knock-down effect of Deltamethrin on mosquitoes
tested was very low (Figure 2).  After 15 minutes, the
proportion of mosquitoes knocked-down was between 0
and 16% versus 86% for the negative control Kisumu.
The effect of Deltamethrin on the different populations
after 15 minutes of exposure was similar (p > 0.05). The
knock-down effect after 30 minutes of exposure to
Deltamethrin varied from 0 to 60% but with a signifi-
cantly low effect on populations of mosquitoes Parakou,
Kandi and Malanville compared to other sites (P < 0.05).
At 60 minutes exposure, the knock-down effect of
Deltamethrin on mosquito populations tested was less
than 80% versus 100% for the susceptible strain Kisumu
(control).  Parakou and Malanville showed the lowest
Knock-down effects (12–19%) after an hour of exposure.
Twenty-four hours post-exposure (Figure 3), the highest
mortality rate (100%) was observed with mosquito popula-
tion from Ouidah (versus 100% for Kisumu), suggesting a
full susceptibility of this population to Deltamethrin
(Figure 3). A suspected resistance to Deltamethrin of mos-
quito populations from Pobe and Parakou was observed
with respective mortalities of 91 and 97%. In Malanville,
Kandi, Dassa, Adjohoun and Allada mortalities ranged be-
tween 14 and 87%, showing that vectors from these sites
were resistant to Deltamethrin. 
between the immediate mortalities induced by Bendiocarb
on mosquitoes from Pobè, Kandi and Malanville and those
of Parakou, Allada, Dassa and Adjohoun (p < 0.05).  The
proportion of dead mosquitoes after 30 minutes of expos-
ure to Bendiocarb is from 3 to 93%. After 60 minutes of ex-
posure, approximately 80% of tested mosquitoes are dead
except Parakou, Dassa and Adjohoun where the observed
mortality is significantly lower (33–77%) (Figure 4).
Mortality rates observed after 24 hours in Pobè, Dassa,
Allada, Malanville and Adjohoun exceeded 98% (Figure 5)
versus 100% for Kisumu. At Kandi and Parakou the ob-
served mortality rates were respectively 92.93% [86.12 to
96.53] and 89.53% [81.88 to 94.24]. This shows a reduced
susceptibility in mosquito of Kandi and resistance in mos-
quito of Parakou (Figure 5).  These results suggest the
emergence of resistance to Bendiocarb from the north of
Benin (Figure 5).
Effect of Pyrimiphos methyl on mosquitoes
The immediate mortalities induced by Pirimiphosmethyl
varied significantly between different mosquito popula-
tions tested (p <0.05) (Figure 6). It is after thirteen minutes
that the effect of Pirimiphos methyl was more perceptible
on mosquitoes (Figure 6). The observed immediate mor-
talities range from 24–95% in Allada, Parakou, Kandi and
Malanville. But, in Pobè, Adjohoun and Allada, the major-
ity of mosquitoes were still alive (Figure 6). After an hour
of exposure, immediate mortality increased in all sites
(43–100%) except Pobè and Adjohoun where mortality is
almost zero (Figure 6).
Mortalities noted after 24 hours of observation were
100% suggesting a complete susceptibility of all mosquito
populations tested to Pirimiphos methyl (Figure 7).
Effect of Bendiocarb on mosquitoes
After 15 min, the immediate mortalities induced by
Bendiocarb on different population of mosquitoes varied
between 0 and 27%. A significant difference was observed 
Fenitrothion effect on mosquitoes
The effect of Fenitrothion on mosquitoes tested was low
and similar between mosquito populations during expos-
ure (Table 1). After 15 and 30 minutes of exposure, the

observed immediate mortalities were almost null (0 to
2.40%).  After 45 minutes, the immediate effect of
Fenitrothion was more evident on mosquito population
from Malanville (25.61% [17.40 to 36.00]) and Allada (23%
[32, 15 to 15.84]) versus 100% fro Kisumu. At 60 minutes
of exposure, immediate mortalities increased to 75% in
Malanville, Kandi, Parakou, and Dassa Allada. But, in Pobè
and Adjohoun immediate mortalities remained zero.
After 24 hours of observation, mortalities varied from
98 to 100% suggesting that all vector populations tested
were susceptible to Fenitrothion (Table 1).
In summary, Deltamethrin resistance was widely dis-
tributed throughout the country (Figure 8). A suspected
resistance to Bendiocarb was observed from the northern
part of the country while a full susceptibility was observed
in the south (Figure 8).  A full susceptibility of vector 
populations to Pirimiphos methyl and Fenitrothion was also
from south to north (Figure 8).
Multiple insecticide resistance mechanisms in Anopheles
gambiae
Data presented in Table 2 shows the distribution of
Knock-down resistance among An. gambiae complex
species (An. gambiae, An. arabiensis, An. coluzzi, and
An. melas). An. gambiae, An. arabiensis, and An. coluzzi
were identified at Allada, Dassa, Parakou, Malanville, and
Kandi but at Ouidah, An. melas was found instead of An.
arabiensis (Table 2).  Knock-down resistance frequencies
were high (78–93%) in all species and at all sites. No sig-
nificant difference was observed when comparing Kdr frea-
quency between An. gambiae, An. Arabiensis, An. coluzzi,
Figure 4 Immediate mortalities observed during mosquitoes exposure to Bendiocarb.

and An. melas (p > 0.05). RR and RS genotypes of Kdr were
found in both dead and survivors but no SS was found.
Insensitive acetylcholinesterase-1 mutation (Ace-1R)
was also identified at Kandi and Parakou at very low fre-
quency (1%).  At the other localities this mutation was
absent with a null frequency (Table 3).  It was not de-
tected in An. coluzzii, An. arabiensis and An. melas spe-
cies but only in heterozygous form in four surviving An.
gambiae species (three from Parakou and one from
Kandi) that were previously identified with Knock-down
resistance mutation (Table 3).
Biochemical assays showed significantly high enzym-
atic activities (MFO, NSE and GST) in some populations
of mosquitoes. Figure 9 shows the average level of oxi-
dase activity (MFO) in the different populations tested.
The activity of cytochrome P450 was significantly higher 
in Allada Parakou compared to Kisumu (p < 0.05)
(Figure 9).
The activity of non-specific esterase (α and β esterase),
was higher in mosquito populations from Kandi, Dassa
Allada and Pobè compared to Kisumu (p < 0.05) (Figures 10
and 11).
High activities of the Glutathione-S-transferase were
observed in the populations of Dassa Allada and Pobè
compared to Kisumu (p < 0.05) (Figure 12).
The observed molecular and biochemical resistance
mechanisms were mapped to show the distribution of
these resistances (Figure 13).
Discussion

insecticides currently used in vectors control strategies in

Benin and shows their distribution. It showed a confirmed
resistance to Deltamethrin (pirethrinoid) throughout the
country except in Ouidah, an emerging resistance to
Bendiorcarb (carbamates) in northern Benin, and a full
susceptibility to Pirimiphos methyl and Fenitrothion
(organophosphate) with a slow effect of Fenitrothion
according to WHO thresholds. These thresholds have
no epidemiological meaning because the field perform-
ance of the insecticides tested remain high [31-33].
However, they were more likely designed to be the trig-
gers of preventive action by national malaria control
program to define efficient strategies to manage insecti-
cide resistance without waiting for indisputable proof
of interventions failure [24].
Resistance levels to Deltamethrin varied between local-
ities reflecting variation in resistance selection pressures on
different vector populations. Deltamethrin and Permethrin 
are the most found insecticides on mass-distributed
insecticide-treated nets in Benin (from national campaign
and routine distributions) with similar coverage rates
between regions (74-94%) [34,35]. This should select resist-
ance in the wild mosquito populations [36] and might ex-
plain the similar frequencies of Knock-down resistance
(Kdr) between regions. In addition, there are also selection
pressures generated by the use of the same class of insecti-
cide in agriculture that represent the main activities of cer-
tain districts [37-39] and could explain the observed
variations. The observed resistance level to Deltamethrin
observed in southern Benin was similar to the results previ-
ously reported by Djègbè et al. [13] and Sovi et al. [40].
The Knock-down resistance gene was the main resist-
ance mechanism found in all assessed mosquito popula-
tions. It was found at very high frequencies (0.80 in
average) in An. gambiae, An. coluzzii, An. arabiensis and

An. melas populations tested, and was widespread in the
country. Their spread could be due to both vector bio-
ecology and resistance selection pressure due to the inten-
sive use of public health insecticides in agriculture [41].
In addition to pyrethroid resistance, we observed the
emergence of carbamates resistance. This resistance to
carbamates was previously reported in Benin by Djogbenou
et al. [42] and Aïkpon et al. [9]. It was associated with very
low frequency of insensitive Ace-1 gene detected. This
mutation was previously reported by Corbel et al. [11],
Djogbénou et al. [43], Djenontin et al. [12], Yadouléton
et al. [44] and by Aikpon et al. [9]. This early spread of

Ace-1R mutation should be monitored closely. As the
use of Bendiocarb in Indoor Residual Spray is part of a
National Malaria Control Program strategy it could
increase the frequency of the Ace-1R gene and lead to a
widespread of this resistance mutation. It is urgent for
this purpose to follow-up monitoring for a better man-
agement of this resistance mechanism.
However, even if Kdr and Ace-1R genes confer a sig-
nificant effect on vector resistance, they do not fully ex-
plain the observed vectors resistance level to insecticides
because homozygous susceptible subjects (SS) survivedto pyrethroids and carbamates exposure suggesting an
involvement of other alternative mechanisms such as
metabolic resistance mechanisms [45].
To assess the metabolic resistance mechanisms involved
in the assessed vector populations, a biochemical approach
was used. High activity of glutathione-s-transferase, cyto-
chrome P450 and non-specific esterases were observed in
some areas of southern and central Benin. These results
were also previously reported in Atacora province [23] and
in Cameroon [46]. These enzymes can confer resistance to

lato collected. 
Figure 12 Glutathion-S-transferase activities in Anopheles gambiae
sensu lato collected.
organophosphates, organochlorines and pyrethroids [47].
They were found with Kdr mutation in the same vector
populations and could confer a cross resistance to pyre-
throids. The over expression of these enzymes could also
explain the slow effect of some organophosphates like
Fenitrothion on mosquito populations in absence of in-
sensitive acetylcholinesterase-1.
Ideally, when the resistance is detected for an insecti-
cide, other insecticide categories must be used as part of
a dynamic resistance management. However, very few
insecticides are currently available for treatment of mos-
quito nets and indoor residual spray [48,49]. The insecti-
cide change can also lead to higher costs of intervention
programs reducing resistance managing options. For ex-
ample, the change from Bendiocarb (8 US$/house) to
Fenitrothion (15.40 US$/house) in indoor residual spray
intervention will be 2 times more expensive [50]. In gen-
eral, the use of insecticides does not create resistance it-
self, but selects a small proportion of subjects with a
genetic mutation that allow them to resist and survive
the effects of the insecticide. If this advantage is main-
tained by a constant use of the same insecticide, the re-
sistant insects will reproduce and the genetic changes
that confer resistance are transferred from parents to
offspring so that eventually resistant subjects become
numerous within the population [51,52]. The spread of
resistant subjects will take more time if the resistance
gene is rare or present at low frequency. It is also com-
plex and depends on several genetic, biological and op-
erational factors [51].  Biological factors affect the life
cycle of the insect (the reproduction rate, the number of
generation or offspring, the rate of migration and isola-
tion, etc.), while genetic factors include intrinsic charac-
teristics of the resistance genes (mono function of
polygenic resistance, domination, genetic cost and the
interaction of genes) [53].  Operational factors concern
the insecticide treatment itself, including the method

and frequency of application, dosage and the residual activ-
ity of the insecticide and the level of insecticide coverage.
In theory, the resistance management of insecticide
resistance should be performed by alternating vector
control methods based on the use of insecticides and
non-insecticidal methods. In practice, most non-
insecticidal methods work well in experimental trials
but become difficult when programs intensify their
long-term use (operational) [54].  Then, operationally, 
the simplest way of resistance management should in-
volve insecticides management. The implementation
of management strategies that may delay selection and
spread of resistance to insecticides is therefore the
main gateway for vector control programs. Another al-
ternative is to find other insecticide formulations that
will enhance the choice possibilities of insecticides.
This data will enable the National Malaria control
programme to determine what insecticide to use and
Page 13

where. They should implement a rapid pro-active re-
sponse to avoid vectors resistance to Pirimiphosmethyl
and delay the spread of Bendiocarb resistance. Alternative
non-insecticidal methods should be used, wherever pos-
sible, to delay insecticide resistance.
Conclusion
This study shows the resistance profile of malaria vectors to
different categories of insecticides used for vector control
in Benin. A widespread malaria vector resistance to pyreth-
roid and an early emergence of carbamates resistance in
the northern region of the country were observed. How-
ever, vectors were fully susceptible to organophosphates
including Pirimiphos methyl and Fenitrothion but with a
rapid susceptibility to the effect of Pirimiphos methyl.
This useful information could help policy-makers to
better plan insecticide resistance management. The most
convenient option is based on the appropriate use of in-
secticides. The moment of insecticide use, method of
use (combined or single), the frequency and duration of
use need to be planned accordingly to delay the spread
of vectors resistance.
