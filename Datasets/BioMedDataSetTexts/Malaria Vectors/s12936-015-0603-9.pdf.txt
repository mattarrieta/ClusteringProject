Abstract
Background: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme that plays an important role in many
cellular functions. Deficiency of this enzyme results from point mutations in the coding region of the G6PD gene.
G6PD-deficiency is important in malaria, as certain anti-malarial drugs could induce haemolysis in such patients and
mutations in this gene may influence the susceptibility or resistance to the disease. Detailed information on genetic
variations in the G6PD gene for Sri Lankan populations is yet to be revealed. This study describes a set of G6PD
mutations present in a Sri Lankan population and their association with uncomplicated malaria.
Methods: DNA was extracted from 1,051 individuals. Sixty-eight SNPs in the region of the G6PD gene were
genotyped. A database created during the 1992–1993 malaria epidemic for the same individuals was used to assess
the associations between the G6PD SNPs and parasite density or disease severity of uncomplicated malaria infections.
Linkage disequilibrium for SNPs and haplotype structures were identified.
Results: Seventeen genetic variants were polymorphic in this population. The mutant allele was the major allele in 9
SNPs. Common G6PD variants already described in Asians or South-Asians seemed to be absent or rare in this population.
Both the severity of disease in uncomplicated malaria infections and parasitaemia were significantly lower in males
infected with Plasmodium falciparum carrying the ancestral allele of rs915942 compared to those carrying the mutant
allele. The parasite density of males infected with P. falciparum was significantly lower also in those who possessed the
mutant alleles of rs5986877, rs7879049 and rs7053878. Two haplotype blocks were identified, where the recombination rates
were higher in males with no history of malaria when compared to those who have experienced the disease in the past.
Conclusions: This is the most detailed survey of G6PD SNPs in a Sri Lankan population undertaken so far that enabled
novel description of single nucleotide polymorphisms within the G6PD gene. A few of these genetic variations
identified, demonstrated a tendency to be associated with either disease severity or parasite density in uncomplicated
disease in males. Known G6PD gene polymorphisms already described from elsewhere were either absent or rare in
the local study population.

Background
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an im-
portant enzyme present in all cells that catalyzes the first
step of the hexose-monophosphate pathway producing
NADPH. Cells require NADPH for many reactions in
biosynthetic pathways including maintenance of the ef-
fective redox potential that helps to protect red cell

membranes against oxidative stress and injury [1]. Defi-
ciencies in G6PD activity give rise to the most common
enzymopathy known affecting over 400 million people
worldwide. Of the various clinical manifestations that
occur due to G6PD deficiency, the most common in-
clude neonatal jaundice and acute haemolytic anaemia
[1]. Certain drugs (e.g. primaquine), infections or foods
(particularly fava beans) can trigger this phenomenon.
The resulting haemolysis is believed to be the result of
the inability of the G6PD-deficient red cells to withstand

the oxidative damage produced either directly or indir-
ectly by these triggering agents.
The G6PD enzyme has over 400 different biochemical
variants as reviewed by Beutler and Vuilliamy [2].  The
coding gene is located on the X chromosome and about
186 genetic variants, which can induce functional en-
zyme deficiency in the host have been described [3].
Many G6PD gene variants are named after locations
from where they were first discovered; for example,
Canton, Mahidol, Kaiping and Viangchang (which have
been identified as the most prevalent in Asian popula-
tions [4]) and G6PD Mediterranean, Orissa, Kalyan-
Kerala, Coimbra (more common Indian variants [3,5,6]).
Mutations in this gene are of practical relevance to
malaria-infected individuals for two main reasons; On one
hand G6PD-deficiency is believed to be associated with
susceptibility or resistance to malarial disease while on the
other hand, certain oxidative anti-malarial drugs (i.e.
primaquine and sulphur containing drugs) can trigger
haemolytic anaemia [7-9], which is of practical concern to
all malaria endemic countries including Sri Lanka.
Although a few studies have been conducted in Sri
Lanka to describe the correlation between drug- induced
haemolysis and the functional G6PD enzyme deficiency
status in mid 1960s [10,11], there is a void due to lack of
recent published data, and no information exists on ei-
ther the genetic variants associated with this condition
or its association with malaria in this country. This study
focuses on G6PD genetic variants that prevail in a se-
lected population in South-Eastern Sri Lanka (residents
of a known endemic area for both Plasmodium vivax
and Plasmodium falciparum malaria) and their possible
association with susceptibility or protection against un-
complicated malarial disease.
Methods
Ethical clearance
Ethical clearance for this study was granted by the Ethics
Review Committee, Faculty of Medicine, University of
Colombo [12]. Informed consent was obtained for all in-
dividuals and where participants were below 18-years
old, proxy consent was sought from their parents or
guardians.
Study area
The study was conducted in Southern Sri Lanka in eight ad-
jacent villages in the Kataragama Medical Officer of Health
(MOH) division in the district of Moneragala namely
Angunnara, Old Buttala Road, Kohombadigana, Karawile,
New Buttala Road, Sella Kataragama, Thanamalwila
Road and Akkarawissa. These villages are situated in
the dry zone of the country. The majority of the po-
pulation in these villages are engaged in agriculture
and farming, except in Sella Kataragama, which is a 
semi-urban area where more residents engaged in oc-
cupations such as small-scale trading. This area experi-
ences annual northeast monsoonal rains which has
been closely linked with the seasonal transmission of
malaria prior to the drastic decline in malaria case
numbers experienced across the country from year
2000 onwards [13,14].  The average mosquito inocula-
tion rates of malaria in the study area during 1992–
1993 was recorded as 0.5-1 mosquito bites per person
per year [13] with the country recording a 285,227 P.
vivax and 77,970 P. falciparum cases [14].
Participants for the study
The villages selected for this study were similar to an earl-
ier epidemiological study described elsewhere [13,15].
Clinical information was extracted from archived data-
bases at the Malaria Research Station (MRS) Kataragama
in order to create a brief history of malaria for each study
site and participant (i.e. number of malaria attacks up to
the year 1992–1993, malaria species, parasitaemia and
disease severity scores of malaria attacks for each indi-
vidual).  Of more than two thousand individuals listed
in the databases, 1,051 were traced and were visited be-
tween December 2006 and May 2007 in order to collect
fresh blood samples for DNA extraction and to collect
more a recent malaria history as part of a study on gen-
omic epidemiology of malaria [15].
Sample and data collection
Two milliliters of blood was collected by venipuncture
from all study participants into EDTA–coated tubes prior
to DNA extraction. Each tube was labeled with a unique
ID number assigned to each individual. The population
consisted of people who have had one or more malaria at-
tacks (with laboratory confirmation) during or prior to
1992–1993 (Group A) and individuals with no history of
malaria attacks during their lifetime up to 1992–1993
(Group B).  The study population was categorized into
these 2 groups based on either the information docu-
mented in the MRS database (1986 to 1993) or individual's
recall memory on history of laboratory-confirmed malarial
disease as of 1992–1993 [16].
DNA extraction and genotyping
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted from blood sam-
ples using Nucleon BACC2 DNA extraction kits [Gen-
Probe Life Sciences, Tepnel Research Products and
Services, Manchester, UK]. Five nano-grammes of gDNA
was whole-genome amplified by primer-extension pre-
amplification (PEP) using N15 primers (Sigma, UK) and
Biotaq (Bioline, UK) polymerase as previously described
by Zhang et al. [17]. Sixty-eight single nucleotide poly-
morphisms (SNPs) located in the G6PD gene and its
flanking regions were selected from the many hundreds

of SNPs identified in the literature and on public databases
based on the given criteria (1) previous associations with
malaria, (2) predicted functional consequences with re-
spect to G6PD enzyme activity (3) estimated minor allele
frequency and (4) whether they made a viable Sequenom
assay design [18]. Three gender-typing markers were also
included. Assays were performed using the Sequenom®
iPLEX platform according to manufacturer’s instruction
using diluted PEP DNA (1:10). Genotype calls were made
using the Sequenom® Typer v4.03 software [19].
Data analysis
Data were analysed using SPSS V 15.0 and Haploview
(V4.2). Eleven SNPs with greater than 10% missing calls
plus 141 individuals with greater than 20% missing calls
were excluded from further analysis. Twenty individuals
whose genotyped sex failed or mismatched with the re-
corded sex were also excluded from the study. After
quality control of samples and SNPs, 57 SNPs in 890 in-
dividuals were selected for further analysis (Table 1).
As described earlier, the population was categorized
into two groups based on the information retrieved from
the MRS databases and each individual’s history based
on recall memory; individuals who had one or more
malaria attacks during 1992 and 1993 (Group A) and in-
dividuals with no history of malaria attacks during their
lifetime up to1992-1993 (Group B). Age distributions of
the 2 groups were comparable.
In addition to the number of malaria infection epi-
sodes over 19 months spanning 1992 and 1993, the MRS
database also contained information on each malaria
episode experienced by study subjects during this period
that included the degree of disease severity, causative
parasite species, parasite density. The severity of clinical
disease in each malaria patient was measured using a
previously validated scoring system which assessed 11
symptoms recorded or reported by the patient in integer
units on a scale of 0 – 2 or 0 – 3 for each symptom [20].
This allows a maximum clinical score (CLS) of 33 for
each individual. Individuals were categorized into three
groups based on the clinical scores of the first infection
acquired during 1992–1993; Low CLS 0–9, Medium
CLS 10–19, and High CLS ≥20. Subjects were also di-
vided into 2 categories (high and low parasitaemic
groups) using an arbitrary cut off for parasite density
(set at 1 parasite per 1000 red blood cells [~0.1%]). Gen-
der stratified analysis was carried out to compare the
parasite density, clinical scores of the groups and their
possible association with identified genetic markers.
Results
Characteristics of the population
During the latest study period (2006–2007), the ages of
the study subjects ranged between 14 to 89 years (mean 
22.3 years, median 21 years).  This equates to an age
range of <12 months-old to 74 years-old (mean 22.3
years-old, median 21 years) at the time of the original
malaria survey in 1992–1993. All the subjects were ap-
parently healthy and blood smear-negative for malaria at
the point of blood sample collection in 2006–2007. All
the subjects belonged to the “Sinhala” race and 51.1% of
the individuals were males (n = 426).
Identification of G6PD gene variants present in the
population
The information on genetic variants studied in this popu-
lation study are summarized in Table 1. Out of the 57 gen-
etic markers that passed quality control (see Methods), 17
SNPs were polymorphic in the Sri Lankan population
(Table 1). Eight SNPs were found at a frequency of less
than 1% and were excluded from further analysis due to
group sizes. The remaining nine SNPs had a minor allele
frequency of greater than 10% (5 had the alternate allele
as the major allele i.e. rs766420, rs915941, rs2071429,
rs4898389 and rs7879049 while the other four SNPs had
the ancestral allele as the major allele i.e. rs915942,
rs2230037, rs5986877 and rs7053878).  Of these nine
markers, two were intronic variants, two were intergenic
variants and two were upstream variants; and the other
three SNPs were 5′  UTR, splice region and non-
synonymous variants (Table 1). A number of the SNPs
genotyped that have been reported in other populations
(G6PD-Mahidol, G6PD-Mediterranean, G6PD-Canton,
G6PD-Viangchang, G6PD-Chinese1&5, G6PD-Valladolid,
G6PD-Vancouver2, G6PD-Mexico City, G6PD-Betica and
G6PD-Union) were not polymorphic in this Sri Lankan
population (Table 1).  Therefore, the analysis was fo-
cused on the nine SNPs with a minor allele frequency of
greater than 10%. Two of these SNPs are located in the
G6PD gene and the other seven in adjacent areas on
that chromosome; i.e. four in immediate downstream of
G6PD gene and three which are known to be in long
range LD with G6PD gene [21].
Relationships of genetic variants with gender and disease
status
The number of females who presented with one or more
malaria attacks during 1992 and 1993 (n = 174) was com-
parable to the number of males with a similar history of
malaria attacks (n = 169) in this population (Chi2 = 0.998,
p = 0.524).  The percentage of individuals carrying the
alternate alleles in group A (malaria-susceptible) and B
(who were apparently protected from uncomplicated mal-
aria disease) were compared using the chi-squared test.
The percentage of males carrying the alternate allele for
rs2071429 (group A: B frequencies = 0.527:0.420, Chi2 =
4.643, p = 0.0312) for rs2230037 (group A: B frequencies =
0.479:0.377, Chi2 = 4.349, p = 0.037) and for rs4898389

Fifty seven SNPs selected for assay are listed. These include SNPs in the G6PD gene, SNPs in the immediate downstream of the G6PD gene and SNPs known to
have long range LD with the G6PD gene: rs numbers/ or primary IDs assigned for each SNP is indicated (GRch37, Ensembl release 68). Chromosome position,
minor allele frequency (MAF) and the function of the polymorphic markers are also stated. Minor allele of each SNP is italicized.
(group A: B frequencies = 0.338:0.661, Chi2 = 4.581, p =
0.031) were significantly different in group A when com-
pared to group B but the percentages between groups A
and B were not different when females were considered for
any of the markers (Table 2).  Of the 343 individuals in
group A, 44% had P. vivax infections, 31.3% had P. falcip-
arum infections and 24.7% have had mixed infections with 
both P. vivax and P. falciparum during 1992 and 1993.
Chi-squared test was used to compare the number of males
and females in high, medium or low CLS groups and high
or low parasite density groups with the presence of the al-
ternate allele in group A. Number of females carrying either
ancestral or alternate allele of any of the tested markers did
not significantly differ in CLS groups or parasite density

groups for P. vivax or P. falciparum. However, in males the
alternate allele of rs915942 was significantly higher in the
low parasitaemia group and low CLS group (for P. falcip-
arum) when compared to the other groups (for CLS: Chi =
15.1, p = 0.019; for parasite density: Chi = 101.1, p = 0.018).
But this scenario was not observed in males with P. vivax
malaria infections.
Furthermore, the number of males in low parasitaemia
group carrying the alternate allele of rs5986877 (Chi =
6.237, p = 0.044), rs7879049 (Chi = 7.292, p = 0.026), and
rs7053878 (Chi = 7.591, p = 0.022) who were infected with
P. falciparum were significantly low when compared to
other groups. But the number of males carrying the alter-
nate allele of SNP rs4898389 was significantly high in low
parasitaemic group for P. falciparum when compared to
the other groups (Chi = 6.811, p = 0.033).
Identification of markers in linkage
Genetic polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium (LD)
were identified using the software Haploview for all individ-
uals. High (D’ ~ 1.00) LD could be observed between sev-
eral pairs of SNPs identified as polymorphic (Figure 1a-g).
Females and males in group B had high LD between these
polymorphic SNPs when compared to the females and
males in group A (Figure 2). The lowest LOD values (Log
of the odds – when 2 loci are in LD) for the SNPs in LD
were seen among males in group A. LD was also observed
between other SNPs with MAF < 10%, however the low
LOD values and r2 values may indicate that the LD
observed between these markers might be due to chance.
Identification of haplotypes in the population
Identification of haplotypes was carried out using all 57
tested SNPs in this population. Haplotype blocks were
defined using the algorithm described by Wang et al. in
2002 [22] and haplotypes were estimated using an
accelerated Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm
described by Qin et al. in 2002 [23] using Haploview
(V 4.2). The blocks were determined for the entire popu-
lation, for group A and group B separately (Table 3), and
for the gender-stratified groups A and B (Table 3). Two
haplotype blocks could be identified in all groups except
in males in group A. The first haplotype block consisted
of two SNPs, i.e. rs915941 and rs915942 (89 bp apart),
forming a major haplotype (AG > 87.0%) in all groups
(except males in group A). The second haplotype block
consisted of 5 SNPs i.e. rs2071429, rs2230037 (SNPs in
the G6PD gene),  rs4898389, rs5986877 and rs7879049 
(SNPs in other locations),  with 2 major haplotypes
(present in > 35% of the population in all groups) and a
minor haplotype (Table 3).  The recombination rates
between the two haplotype blocks ranged between
0.48 – 0.76, the lowest among the females with apparent
protection and the highest among the males with appar-
ent protection from clinical malaria. The susceptible
males demonstrated one haplotype block with two major
haplotypes each occurring in >40% of individuals in that
group and three minor haplotypes (Table 3).
Discussion
This study was conducted to identify variants within the
G6PD gene present in a population residing in a malaria-
endemic area in southern Sri Lanka. Although there had
been a few studies described in the past in Sri Lanka on
G6PD enzyme functional deficiency [10,11], there are no
studies, as far as it is known to identify genetic polymor-
phisms and nucleotide variability of the G6PD gene and
no information exists on its association with malaria. The
57 SNPs that were studied in the G6PD gene are known
coding variants and/or previously identified through asso-
ciation studies with G6PD deficiency per se or with mal-
aria, and all selected markers made valid Sequenom assays.
Although some G6PD gene variants including G6PD
Mahidol variant (rs137852314),  Mediterranean variant
(rs5630868), Canton variant (rs72554665) and Viangchan
variant (rs13785237),  G6PD Kaiping (rs72554664) and
G6PD Vanua Lava (rs78365220) have been established as
those that prevail in Asian populations, none of these
SNPs were found to be polymorphic in the Sri Lankan
population studied. Similar findings with regard to the
Mediterranean variant has been reported previously on a
limited number of samples tested from a different location
within Sri Lanka [24].
Of the nine markers with MAF > 10%,  4 SNPs i.e.
rs915942, rs2230037, rs5986877 and rs7053878 the alter-
nate allele was the minor allele. These studies are in line
with data available online on Asian populations [25].
However, it is interesting to note that the allele frequen-
cies of the alternate alleles of rs2230037 and rs5986877
are much higher when compared to a general Asian
population as reported previously (Table 4).  Moreover,
the minor allele for rs766420 in the Sri Lankan population
was the ancestral allele (C) whereas the minor allele in the
general Asian population was the alternate allele (G). Fur-
thermore, the minor allele frequencies of rs2071429,
rs4898389 and rs7879049 (for which the minor allele is

the ancestral allele) are higher when compared to the
minor allele frequencies of these markers in the general
Asian population.
These differences might be due to the fact that the
genetic variants of Han-Chinese or Japanese population
(which are different from the South-Asian or Sri Lankan
populations) may have contributed largely to the frequen-
cies calculated for the general Asian populations [25]. The
variants G6PD Punjab, Kalyan-Kerala although identified
as common in neighbouring Indian populations were not
typed as they could not be designed as SQNM assays.
Of the 57 SNPs genotyped, nine (of which two are in the
G6PD gene) had frequencies greater than 10% in this Sri
Lankan population. The observations made regarding the
males who carried the alternate alleles for rs2071429 and
rs2230037 being more susceptible for malaria (Table 2)
suggest a gender-biased effect for the mutant type of these
SNPs. However homozygous or heterozygous females with
the alternate allele of these SNPs did not show any associ-
ation with malaria disease status.
Population studies on relationships between genetic
polymorphisms in the G6PD gene and phenotypic charac-
teristics in uncomplicated malaria are rare. Louicharoen
et al. [9] observed that the G6PD Mahidol variant (found 
in a Thai population) was associated with a significant re-
duction in P. vivax parasite density both in heterozygous
and homozygous females as well as in hemizygous males,
whereas no association was observed with P. falciparum
parasite density. This study however, looked at the G6PD
Mahidol variant only, whereas the current study analyzed
several G6PD variants. The degree of association (pro-
tection/susceptibility) with the disease status might differ
according to the type of mutation and of course from
population to population. A similar case–control study
done in Afghanistan by Leslie et al. [26] has also shown
that the association between G6PD gene mutations and
protection against vivax malaria is seen less often in het-
erozygous females when compared to hemizygous males.
The current study confirms the observations made by
Leslie et al. [26] that either protection and/or susceptibil-
ity to the disease are enhanced by mutations in G6PD
gene in hemizygous males rather than in heterozygous fe-
males, indicating that mono-allelic status of X-linked
markers might have a correlation with the disease status
rather than the bi-allelic status of the markers in females.
Furthermore, the results of the present study indicate that
it is not enhanced in homozygous females either. Random
inactivation of one of the two inherited X chromosomes

does occur in females. Therefore, although genotyped as
homozygote with the ancestral or the alternate allele the
actual proportion of females that express the gene activity
might be much lower, therefore, the relationship between
the marker and the disease status may not be evident.
Bienzle et al. [27] had reported lower parasite densities
(as an indication of disease severity) in two groups of
G6PD non-deficient male individuals with different vari-
ants of G6PD enzyme activity. The current study reveals
male cases carrying the ancestral allele of rs915942 had
significantly lower parasite densities for P. falciparum
when compared to males carrying the alternate allele.
However, since G6PD enzyme functional assays were
not carried out, it is not possible to comment on any
possible associations with the functional status of this
enzyme in the study subjects.
Reports on comparisons between G6PD gene muta-
tions and disease status of severe and complicated mal-
aria are abundant. A large-scale study done in Kenya by
Ruwende et al. [7] revealed that mutations in G6PD are
associated with reduction in the risk of severe malaria
for both hemizygous males and heterozygous females.
However, in two studies done in Mali and Pakistan there
was no such association between heterozygous females
and severe malaria which is believed to be due to the
control group being individuals with ‘uncomplicated
malaria’  compared to the cases of severe and compli-
cated malaria [8,26,28].  In the current study, the study
subjects who had one or more malaria infections during
the study period in 1992–1993 (group A) were com-
pared against the individuals (group B) who at the point
of data collection (1992–1993) have never acquired mal-
aria during the lifetime according to the records main-
tained in the field site and subjects’ history based on his
or her memory. Therefore, there may have been inac-
curacies in the categorization of “protected individuals”
and “susceptible individuals” that may have reduced the 
power of evidence towards the relationship between the
mutant genetic markers and malaria. Guindo et al. [8] ob-
served that male individuals with mutations in G6PD
(G6PD A- mutation at nucleotide position 202) were pro-
tected from severe malaria. This protection was found
only in males but not in heterozygous females. More re-
cently, a large multi-centre cases-control study of severe
malaria involving 12,000 cases and 17,000 controls dem-
onstrated a highly significant association of G6PD-202
with risk of severe malarial anaemia while a small but sig-
nificant protection with cerebral malaria [19].  This not
only supports the notion that balancing selection occurs
in G6PD, but that the relationship of G6PD with disease
status is very complex. Moreover a recently study of gen-
etic structure with enzyme function showed a possible
interaction between G6PD polymorphisms modifying the
outcome [18].
It is, therefore, important to note that there is a major
impact of natural selection that occur in malaria hyper-
endemic areas, such as Africa, where the numbers of
G6PD-deficient homozygous females in populations are
very rare [8]. However, this is unlikely to have happened
in this study population considering the low and sea-
sonal malaria transmission that prevailed in Sri Lanka,
from as far back as it is known. This very fact and the
genetic variations between the African and Asian popu-
lations may account for the differences observed in this
study.
Very high linkage disequilibrium was seen between
seven of the nine SNPs with MAF > 10%. Complete link-
age disequilibrium could be observed between rs915941
and rs915942, and a similar scenario has been observed in
other populations as well (e.g. Gujarati Indians and Han
Chinese populations). This could be perhaps due to the
very close chromosome locations; 153626649, 153626738
respectively [25]. Unusually high levels of linkage disequi-
librium among the markers within G6PD gene has also
been observed by Saunders et al. [29].  Furthermore, as
many of these tested SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium it
could be assumed that there might be a combined effect
of these host genetic markers towards malaria disease sta-
tus. When multiple markers in linkage disequilibrium are
studied to assess their association with disease traits,
haplotype analysis may be more efficient and accurate
than separate analyses of the genetic markers. With this
premise and with the finding that rs925941 and rs915942
(Block 1) and rs2071429, rs2230037, rs4898389, rs5986877
and rs7879049 (Block 2) fall into the same haplotype
blocks are likely to indicate a possible collective effect of
these SNPs over malaria infection.
Conclusions
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms within the G6PD gene
are described in this study population from Sri Lanka.

This is the first time that such a dense set of G6PD poly-
morphisms have been investigated and identified in a Sri
Lankan population. Furthermore, it was evident that the
common mutations previously described in the Asian or
South Asian region are absent or rare in the local popu-
lation. In light of this further studies to investigate the
full spectrum of mutations in Sri Lanka population
would help not only understand more on the ancestry of
this gene in Sri Lanka but also aid the functional signifi-
cance of these observed polymorphisms. The study also
provides evidence for likely associations of these varia-
tions either individually and/or collectively with traits of
uncomplicated malaria. Further investigations are underway
to combine detailed genetic analyses with functional en-
zyme studies, which are likely to reveal more information.
