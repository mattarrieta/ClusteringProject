Abstract
Background: Despite the efforts of the National Malaria Control Programme, malaria remains as an important public
health problem in Bangladesh, particularly in the south-eastern region bordering India. Successful malaria control
strategies rely on a detailed understanding of the underlying causes of malaria transmission. Here, an entomological
survey was conducted in a malaria endemic area of Bangladesh bordering India to investigate the Anopheles mosquito
community and assess their Plasmodium infection status.
Methods: Monthly entomological collections were undertaken from October 2010 to September 2011 in five villages
in the Matiranga sub-district, Khagrachari district in Bangladesh, bordering the Indian State of Tripura. CDC miniature
light traps were placed inside houses to collect adult Anopheles mosquitoes. Following morphological and molecular
identification of the female Anopheles mosquitoes collected, they were screened for circumsporozoite proteins (CSP) of
Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), Plasmodium vivax-210 (Pv-210) and Plasmodium vivax-247 (Pv-247), by ELISA to determine
natural infection rates. Variation in Anopheles species composition, relative abundance and Plasmodium infection rates
were analysed between sampled villages.
Results: A total of 2,027 female Anopheles were collected, belonging to 20 species. Anopheles nivipes was the most
abundant species in our test villages during the peak malaria transmission season, and was observed sympatrically with
An. philippinensis in the studied area. However, in the dry off-peak season, An. jeyporiensis was the most abundant
species. Shannon’s diversity index was highest in October (2.12) and evenness was highest in May (0.91). The CSP ELISA
positive rate overall was 0.44%. Anopheles karwari (n = 2), An. barbirostris s.l. (n = 1) and An. vagus (n = 1) were recorded
positive for Pf. Anopheles kochi (n = 1) was positive for Pv-210 while An. umbrosus (n = 1), An. nivipes (n = 1) and An.
kochi (n = 1) were positive for Pv-247. A mixed infection of Pf and Pv-247 was detected in An. barbirostris s.l..
Conclusion: High diversity of Anopheles species was observed in areas close to the international border where species
that were underestimated for malaria transmission significantly outnumbered principal vector species and these may
play a significantly heightened role in malaria transmission.

Background
There were an estimated 198 million cases and 584,000
deaths attributed to malaria globally during 2013 [1]. In
Bangladesh, malaria represents a major public health
concern with approximately 27,000 cases and 15 deaths
reported during 2013 [2]. Malaria in Bangladesh is mark-
edly seasonal, where the warm and wet months of May-
October define the peak malaria transmission season, and
the dry and cooler months of November-April define the
off-peak season [3]. Although once widespread throughout
the country, malaria is now restricted to 13 districts bor-
dering India and Myanmar [4]. In particular, Khagrachari,
Bandarban and Rangamati districts along with Cox’s Bazar
districts in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), account for
80% of malaria cases of the country [5].
Caused predominantly by Plasmodium falciparum
(Pf ), the epidemiology and therefore control of malaria
in this region is complicated by high local Anopheles
vector diversity and the fact that most vectors are mem-
bers of species complexes. These species include Anoph-
eles (Cellia) vagus Dӧnitz, An. (C.) jeyporiensis James
and An. (C.) nivipes Theobald in addition to known major
vectors An. (C.) baimaii Sallum & Peyton, An. (C.) mini-
mus complex Theobald, An. (C.) philippinensis Ludlow,
An. (C.) epiroticus Linton & Harbach, An. (C.) aconitus
Dӧnitz and An. (C.) annularis van der Wulp [6,7].
Topologically, the CHT districts vary from other regions
of the country being typified by ranges of forested hills
and associated valleys with rivers and small lakes [8] that
provide abundant oviposition sites for potential vector
species. With the presence of a diverse vector commu-
nity on both sides of the Bangladesh-India border, vec-
tor control interventions in this region are currently
reported as inadequate [7-9]. The remote and hilly ter-
rain of the border belt areas makes malaria transmis-
sion here harder to interrupt. Moreover, unrestricted
movement of people across the border for occupation
and trade increase the complexity of transmission.
Taken together, this has led to malaria persistence in
the villages adjacent to the border [10].
Over the decades, the abundance of different Anoph-
eles species throughout the endemic areas of Bangladesh
has changed [6-8].  Deforestation and changing agricul-
tural practices in the CHT [11] may explain the altered
abundance of Anopheles species and their vectorial role
[7],  once prevalent species have been documented as
rare in more recent studies [7,8].  However, only a few
data on mosquito diversity and abundance in the hilly
border belt areas are available [7,8,12].  Prediction of
malaria epidemics and plans for control programmes are
greatly dependent on knowledge of vector dynamics and
distribution [13] because disease transmission depends on
the presence or absence of vector species and their spe-
cific behaviours [14].  A better understanding of vector 
species is necessary for any successful integrated control
strategy [15]. This entomological survey was undertaken
in a malaria endemic area of CHT, near the Bangladesh-
India border to reveal the diversity and abundance of
Anopheles species over the study period, the variation of
Anopheles mosquito diversity and abundance among vil-
lages and distances from the international border and
their Plasmodium infection status.
Methods
Study area
The study was conducted in the Matiranga sub-district
(23°02′19″N, 91°52′36″E) of Khagrachari district, adja-
cent to the Bangladesh-India border (Figure 1).  Matir-
anga, covers approximately 495 km2  and supports
126,477 people at a density of 255.3 per km2 [16]. The
region has a tropical monsoon climate. During the study
period, there was an average rainfall of 217.17 mm and
annual average maximum and minimum temperatures
of 30.1°C and 20.6°C, respectively and an average humid-
ity of 79.25% (data obtained from a weather station situ-
ated at Rangamati which is 15 kilometres away from the
study site) were recorded. During surveys, the landscape
comprised of paddy fields on the plains and unused
shrub lands or teak plantations in hilly areas.
Entomological investigations were conducted in the
following five villages: Azoddha, Belchhari, Aambagan,
Khedachhara and Natunpara (listed by proximity to the
Bangladesh-India international border). Bengali and indi-
genous people reside in mixed communities, in houses
constructed mostly of mud and bamboo. Villages were
selected based on high malaria endemicity reports, ac-
cording to data obtained from the Upazilla Health Com-
plex (UHC) of Matiranga.
Collection of Anopheles mosquitoes
Monthly entomological surveys were undertaken be-
tween October 2010 and September 2011 in each village.
Adult mosquitoes were collected from the sleeping room
of houses using battery operated CDC miniature light
traps (Model: 1012, Origin: John W. Hock Inc, USA) be-
tween 1800 and 0600 hours. All houses in each village
were numbered and an online randomizer ([URL: "http://www.randomizer.org/form.htm"] http://www.
 randomizer.org/form.htm) was used to randomly deter-
mine which house to sample.
Each month, five light traps were installed in a village
for one night. This enabled five consecutive trap nights
in five villages giving 25 traps per month. A total of 60
trap nights were run in each village. Thus, in five villages
a total of 300 trap nights were run.
Processing of mosquitoes
Mosquitoes were taken to the International Centre for
Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh (icddr,b), field

laboratory in Matiranga, killed by chloroform and sub-
sequently identified. Mosquito identification to species
level was undertaken using a stereomicroscope, accord-
ing to Peyton et al. [17] and Nagpal and Sharma [18].
After identification, each mosquito was preserved in a
cryo-vial (labelled with species name, trap number and
date) containing desiccant until further analyses.
Mosquito sample preparation
After field identification, the mosquitoes were taken to
the Parasitology Laboratory at icddr,b, Dhaka for further
analyses. Each mosquito was dissected into head +
thorax and abdomen and homogenized individually in
200 μL and 100 μL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
respectively. The abdomen homogenate was used for
PCR analysis to confirm species identification after DNA
extraction as described below and from the head +
thorax homogenate 150 μL was used for circumsporo-
zoite protein specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (CSP ELISA).
Molecular identification of mosquitoes
DNA was extracted from mosquito homogenates using
the CHELEX® protocol of Lardeux et al. [19] with the
following modifications. Briefly, 50 μL CHELEX® -100
(50% v/v) solution was added to 100 μL mosquito hom-
ogenate. After an incubation of 15 minutes at 100°C, the
mixture was centrifuged at maximum speed for 5 mi-
nutes. 30 μL of supernatant was transferred to a new
tube and 2 μL Proteinase-K solution was added. After
subsequent incubations at 37°C for 45 minutes and at
100°C for 5 minutes the DNA was ready. PCR was
undertaken with the extracted mosquito DNA to con-
firm the taxonomic identification where an established
protocol was available. Protocols previously described by
Huong et al. [20] for confirmation of An. baimaii, Phuc
et al. [21],  for species belonging to An. minimus com-
plex and the Myzomyia Series, as well as two different
protocols of Walton et al. [22,23] for confirmation of
An. annularis and members of the An. (C.) maculatus
Theobald group were used. A S1000® Thermal Cycler
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.,  Hercules, CA, USA) was
used for amplification reactions. Post amplification PCR
products were electrophoresed on ethidium bromide-
stained 1.5% agarose gels, along with Invitrogen® 100
base pair (bp) molecular mass marker (Life Technolo-
gies, NY, USA) and visualized under UV illumination.
CSP ELISA
ELISAs were completed according to Wirtz et al. [24]
with slight modification (phosphate buffered saline in-
stead of blocking buffer was used to prepare mosquito
homogenates) to detect CSP of Pf and two CSP poly-
morphs of P. vivax (Pv-210 and Pv-247).  Field caught 
male mosquitoes were used as negative controls. The
positive controls and monoclonal antibodies were ob-
tained from the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC),  Atlanta, USA. The Optical Density (OD)
was measured at 410 nm in a Bio-Rad ELISA plate
reader, 60 minutes after substrate addition. A cut-off
value at least twice the mean OD of the negative con-
trols was considered as positive. All positive samples
were confirmed by repeated ELISA.
Data analysis
Mosquito species diversity and evenness in different
months and villages were calculated by using the Shan-
non’s diversity index (H') and Shannon’s evenness index
(E) [25]. Shannon’s diversity index and evenness denote
the faunal diversity of a community. Since the sample
size of Plasmodium positive mosquitoes was too small
to allow statistical analyses, mosquito light trap count
data of the ten most common Anopheles species and
whether Plasmodium positive was used to compare
among villages. The overall variation of mosquito abun-
dance was compared among villages using risk ratio by
negative binomial regression because the mean number
of mosquitoes is greater than the variance per village.
According to Ejercito and Urbino [26] and Nagpal and
Sharma [18] the flight range of the ten most common
Anopheles species collected in this study is generally
within one kilometre. Therefore, the distance was taken
into consideration to further explore which village shows
the maximum variation in terms of mosquito abun-
dance. Villages were compared after adjusting the dis-
tance of villages from the international border. Similar
analysis was undertaken for each mosquito species to
see variation among villages. All data analysis was con-
ducted in R (version 3.0.2) [27].  The geographic posi-
tions of the sampled houses were taken with a GPS
receiver (Garmin 60CS).  ArcGIS 10 (ESRI, CA, USA)
was used for map preparation.
Ethical approval
Written consents were obtained from the households
where mosquito collections were conducted. Ethical ap-
proval was obtained from Research Review Committee
and Ethical Review Committee of icddr,b for this study.
Results
A total of 2,027 female Anopheles mosquitoes were
caught (6.76 mosquitoes/trap night, standard error 1.46).
Twenty species were confirmed based on taxonomic
characteristics and molecular diagnosis for available spe-
cies complexes. Of 292 mosquitoes morphologically
identified as An. philippinensis,  247 were molecularly
identified as An. nivipes,  with the reminder (45) being
An. philippinensis.  In the present study, three of 19

specimens morphologically identified as An. minimus
were molecularly identified as An. (C.) varuna Iyengar.
The remaining 16 specimens were confirmed as An. mini-
mus (An. minimus former species A) by PCR. Of 35 An.
varuna specimens identified by morphology, one speci-
men was revised to An. minimus after molecular analysis.
Concordance between morphological and molecular iden-
tification was observed for all other specimens and
species.
Anopheles jeyporiensis was observed as the dominant
species overall (n = 505, 24.91%), due primarily to a high
trap count (n = 267) during November (Table 1 and
Figure 2).  The next most numerous species were An.
nivipes (n = 330),  An. (C.) kochi Dӧnitz (n = 259),  An.
(C.) karwari James (n = 219) and An. vagus (n = 217)
(Table 1). A sharp decrease in the mean number of mos-
quitoes was observed from January (which is considered
as the dry season) to May, the first month of the wet
season in Bangladesh. Mean number of mosquitoes
began to increase in June (Figure 2).  Interestingly, the
abundance of traditionally accepted primary vector species 
such as An. baimaii, An. philippinensis and An. minimus
was observed to be much less than newly documented or
secondary vector mosquitoes such as An. jeyporiensis, An.
vagus and An. nivipes (Table 1).
Species richness was highest (17) in November and
lowest (4) in February. However, Shannon’s diversity
index was highest in October (H' = 2.12) (Table 2).
Anopheles nivipes (n = 233) was recorded to be the dom-
inant species during peak malaria transmission season,
followed by An. (A.) peditaeniatus Leicester (n = 112),
An. vagus (n = 105), An. karwari (n = 99), An. kochi (n =
95),  and An. jeyporiensis (n = 93) (Figure 3).  However,
during the off-peak season, An. jeyporiensis was the
dominant species (n = 412),  followed by An. kochi (n =
164) and An. karwari (n = 120).
CSP ELISA was carried out on all 2,027 females col-
lected. CSP positivity was observed in nine mosquitoes
(0.44%) belonging to six species, which were collected
from eight houses (Table 3). Plasmodium falciparum in-
fection was reported from four mosquitoes (0.19%): one

and two An. karwari. A single An. kochi was observed to
be infected with Pv-210 while three additional mosqui-
toes (0.15%) identified as An. (A.) umbrosus Theobald,
An. nivipes and An. kochi were positive for Pv-247. Add-
itionally, one An. barbirostris s.l. was recorded positive
for both Pf and Pv-247.

villages. Shannon’s species diversity was highest in
Khedachhara (H' = 2.25) and evenness was highest in
Natunpara (E = 0.83) (Table 4). Overall mosquito abun-
dance varied significantly (p < 0.05) among the villages
while it was significantly greater in Azoddha (p < 0.05)
(Additional file 1: Tables S1 and S2). Azoddha was also
observed to be significantly (p < 0.05) different from
other villages when the distances of villages from the
international border was considered (Additional file 1:
Tables S3, S4 and S5). In addition, An. kochi, An. vagus,
An. barbirostris s.l., An. nivipes, An. peditaeniatus, An.
jeyporiensis,  An. (A.) nigerrimus Giles and An. varuna 
were significantly (p < 0.05) more abundant in Azoddha
(Additional file 1: Tables S6, S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, S12
and S13). Among the eight houses detected harbouring
CSP positive mosquitoes, six were located in this village
(Table 3).
Discussion
Twenty Anopheles species were recorded in Matiranga
in this study, which is 25% higher than the number of
species (n = 15) previously reported from this area dur-
ing the peak transmission season [8]. Three recent stud-
ies in an ecologically and topologically similar region of
Bandarban reported 20, 21 and 22 Anopheles species, re-
spectively [7,28,12]. Another entomological study in the
Tripura state of neighbouring India identified 13 Anoph-
eles species during peak transmission in June [9].  The
full-year trapping effort may be the reason for the higher
species diversity observed in this study. Anopheles jey-
poriensis was observed to be the dominant mosquito

species in the current study. As in a previous study in
an ecologically similar area of Bandarban [7],  An. jey-
poriensis (24.91%) was observed to be the dominant
mosquito species overall. However, An. nivipes, the sec-
ond most abundant species overall (16.18%) was the
most abundant species during the peak transmission
season, echoing the findings of Alam et al. [7]. Overall,
dominancy was observed from An. vagus (51.7%) followed
by An. philippinensis (22.92%) in another similar study in
Bandarban [12].
Anopheles philippinensis is considered to be the most
important malaria vector in the flood plains of Bangladesh
[6]. Recent entomological investigations have reported the
abundance of this species in CHT [28,12], as well as in the
Matiranga border adjacent to the north-eastern Indian
state of Tripura [9]. However, the precise limits of the dis-
tribution of this species cannot be defined due to its com-
mon misidentification with An. nivipes.  Alam et al. [7] 
confirmed all specimens morphologically identified as An.
philippinensis in Bandarban, to be An. nivipes by molecu-
lar assay. Nagpal and Sharma [29] also stated that previ-
ously identified An. philippinensis from north eastern
India were in fact An. nivipes. In the present study, coex-
istence of An. nivipes and An. philippinensis was con-
firmed in Matiranga. One specimen of morphologically
identified An. philippinensis that was reported positive
for Pv-210 in the previous study in Matiranga [8], may
have actually been An. nivipes. The coexistence of two
such closely related species in a malaria hyperendemic
area indicates the importance of detailed entomological
investigations. As previously reported from the CHT
[7], all specimens of An. minimus complex collected in
the current study were confirmed as An. minimus by
PCR.
Recent studies have implicated An. jeyporiensis,  An.
nivipes and An. vagus as potential vectors of malaria

parasites in the CHT [7,12].  These three species were
similarly abundant in this surveillance study and one spe-
cimen each of An. vagus and An. nivipes were recorded
positive for Pf and Pv-247, respectively, confirming
their role in malaria transmission in Matiranga. Similar
to Bangladesh, these unimportant mosquitoes have also
been recorded to be positive for Plasmodium in areas of
the international borders of Bangladesh. Based on mor-
phological identification, An. jeyporiensis was recorded to
be positive in a study conducted in Bangladesh-Myanmar
border [30]. Molecular evidence had revealed the involve-
ment of An. nivipes and An. vagus for malaria transmission
in north-eastern India, which is adjacent to Matiranga,
Khagrachari [31,32].
Plasmodium infection in An. karwari,  An. kochi and
An. umbrosus observed in the present investigation cor-
roborates previous studies [7,8,12]. Anopheles kochi has
been implicated as a malaria vector of Assam in north-
east India [32], and this species and An. karwari can be
considered as vectors in Bangladesh [7,12].  Anopheles
barbirostris s.l. was reported to be CSP positive in Sri
Lanka for Pf [33], as well as in a previous investigation
in Matiranga and Bandarban [8,12]. In the current study,
two specimens of An. barbirostris s.l. were CSP positive
where one specimen was positive for Pf and a mixed in-
fection of Pf and Pv-247 was recorded in the other. Such
a mixed infection has not been reported before in An.
barbirostris s.l. from Bangladesh and is rarely reported
in southeast Asia [34].  More studies need to be con-
ducted on these species in order to define their precise
role in malaria transmission.
Forests of the CHT have been converted to unused
shrub lands, agricultural lands and human settlements
over the last 30 years [11,35].  Deforestation can sig-
nificantly alter the mosquito community by magnify-
ing vector density and abundance in the deforested
areas [36,37].  It is evident from the current study
that, principal vector mosquitoes, such as An. baimaii
and An. minimus were noted to be very low in abun-
dance compared to more recently implicated vector
species.
Increasing population growth and human encroachment
into previously under-developed international border areas 
has resulted in a higher contact rate between human and
vector mosquitoes, increasing malaria parasite transmis-
sion [38].  In the current study significantly higher mos-
quito abundance and more ELISA positive mosquitoes
were recorded in Azoddha, which is situated within two
kilometres of the Bangladeshi-Indian border. During field
surveys this village was observed to be surrounded by rice
fields, which made this village different than other villages.
Since the flight range of most Anopheles species is believed
to be approximately one kilometre [26,18], malaria trans-
mission dynamics in trans-border areas might be influ-
enced by such local spatial variation of potential vector
mosquitoes observed in this study.
Conclusion
Similar to other endemic areas of CHT, Matiranga has
diverse Anopheles fauna. However, low densities of rec-
ognized vectors and comparatively greater abundance of
previously underappreciated Anopheles species may play
a significantly heightened role in malaria transmission in
areas adjacent to the Bangladesh-India border.
