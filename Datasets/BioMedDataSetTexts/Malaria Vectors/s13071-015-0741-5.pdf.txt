Abstract
Background: To reveal the spatio-temporal distribution of malaria vectors in the national malaria surveillance sites
from 2005 to 2010 and provide reference for the current National Malaria Elimination Programme (NMEP) in China.
Methods: A 6-year longitudinal surveillance on density of malaria vectors was carried out in the 62 national malaria
surveillance sites. The spatial and temporal analyses of the four primary vectors distribution were conducted by the
methods of kernel k-means and the cluster distribution of the most widely distribution vector of An.sinensis was
identified using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD).
Results: Totally 4 species of Anopheles mosquitoes including An.sinensis, An.lesteri, An.dirus and An.minimus were
captured with significant difference of distribution as well as density. An. sinensis was the most widely distributed,
accounting for 96.25% of all collections, and its distribution was divided into three different clusters with a
significant increase of density observed in the second cluster which located mostly in the central parts of China.
Conclusion: This study first described the spatio-temporal distribution of malaria vectors based on the nationwide
surveillance during 2005–2010, which served as a baseline for the ongoing national malaria elimination program.

Background
Malaria, HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) are considered
to be the three major public health problems in the
world. In order to timely monitor the malaria epidemic
and provide evidence for strategies development as well
as evaluation of control activities, China government is-
sued in 2005 the malaria surveillance program which
was trialed out until 2010, and totally 62 townships in
18 provinces were selected as the sentinel sites where
the malaria vectors were surveyed every 15 days from
June to October [1]. However, the spatio-temporal infor-
mation of continuous vectors surveillance has not been
mined particularly for the NMEP from the perspective
of vector control.

With continuous reduction of malaria incidence, a
strong political commitment was made by China
through issuing the National Action Plan for Malaria
Elimination (2010–2020) in 2010. The goal is to elimin-
ate locally acquired malaria by the end of 2015 except
for the bordering areas in Yunnan Province, and elimin-
ate the disease by 2020 nationwide. Though well-
described relationships between the parasite, man and
vector will provide an empirical basis for eradication of
this disease, until recently there has been a paucity of
systematic data on malaria vectors distribution in the
malaria epidemic-prone regions of China. Undoubtedly,
the efficiency of malaria elimination interventions will
depend largely on information of the distribution of pri-
mary vectors. It is evident from a series of studies in
China as well as in other countries [2-7] that the tem-
poral and spatial distribution of malaria vectors is very
dynamic. Thus, knowledge of the spatio-temporal mal-
aria vector distribution will facilitate the malaria elimin-
ation efforts and overall mapping is needed to focus on
priority areas for additional surveillance and response.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to map the
spatio-temporal distribution of malaria vectors to pro-
vide a dataset that would aid informed decision making
on malaria elimination program, and to provide a basis
for implementation of the elimination strategy in China.
Methods
Study areas
All the 62 national malaria surveillance sites between
2005 and 2010 in China were enrolled for malaria vectors
surveillance during the transmission seasons (Figure 1).
These sites were divided into the following three categor-
ies based on the transmission levels of malaria [1]:
1. Unstable endemic areas: 30 townships in 6 provinces
(Hainan, Yunnan, Anhui, Hubei, Henan, Jiangsu) [5
counties/ province, 1 township/county].
2. Low endemic areas: 24 townships in 8 provinces
(Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Guangdong,
Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian) [3 counties/
province, 1 township/county]. 
3. Pre-elimination areas: 8 townships in 4 provinces
(Shanghai, Zhejiang, Shandong, Liaoning) [2
counties/province, 1 township/county].
Malaria vector surveillance methods
According to WHO recommendations [8], human land-
ing catches were made by two adult volunteers from the
local population working beside the bed-net with one
sleeping person. Mosquitoes coming to bite the collec-
tors or sleeping person were detected using a flashlight,
collected with glass tubes (CDC backpack aspirator:
John W. Hock Co.,  Florida, USA) and placed in the
screened pint-sized containers. Collections were con-
ducted from 18:00 to 06:00 overnight during every
15 days from June to October, 2005–2010. Collectors
worked in pairs for 6-h shifts. Mosquitoes were taken to
the laboratory and killed by suffocation with chloroform
vapor. They were counted and identified morphologic-
ally using taxonomic keys [9], and the density was calcu-
lated as the number of female adults per man per night.

Spatial and temporal clustering
Kernel k-means method was used to identify the spatial
distribution of malaria vectors in terms of density in the
surveillance sites. We had surveillance on malaria vec-
tors every 15 days during June and October from 2005
to 2010. For the 62 sentinel sites, each had 60 time series
data equaling 60 dimensions. In this research, each time
series data denotes the density of An.sinensis, An.lesteri,
An.dirus or An.minimus per site. The time series data of
these surveillance sites were interlocked, indicating the
observed data in one site would not always be higher or
lower than that in other sites. The classic classifier (such
as k-means) would not perform well in this situation.
Kernel k-means method performs well for those high di-
mensional and nonlinear data [10].  Comparing to the
classic k-means, all of the operations will be done in fea-
ture space for kernel k-means [11]. With kernel k-means
method, all data are projected in high dimension feature
space that the data will be easily linearly classified in fea-
ture space. In feature space, the original data (x1
,…,xN
)
which represent the density of the malaria vector, will be
projected to be (φ(x1
), …, φ(xN
)). The processes of kernel
k-means are as follows [10]:
(a) Initializing the centers mk
(k =1,…,K) for those
clusters in feature space.
(b)Assigning each observed value φ(xi
)(i = 1, …, N) to
the nearest center, and the distance between
observed value and center is computed through
Euclidean distance:

(d)Repeat step (b) and (c), until the E is stable or less
than a threshold value.
Caliński [12] proposed the CH index to indicate the
number of clusters. The CH index simultaneously in-
cludes the variances of within-cluster and between-
clusters. The formula of CH index is as follows:
CH kð Þ ¼ ½   B=ð  Þ k−1 =½   W=ð  Þ n−k
B denotes variances of between-clusters, W are the
variances of within-cluster, k is the clusters’ count, n in-
dicates the count of monitoring station. The high CH
value indicates the well clustering results. In this re-
search, we chose the count of clusters when the CH 
index is highest. The kernel k-means function was used
the “kern lab” package [13] in R [14] in our study.
Temporal period and trend decomposition
Empirical mode decomposition (EMD), an adaptive time
series data analysis model [15,16],  was used to identify
the temporal trend of malaria vectors in terms of density
in the clustered surveillance sites. In EMD analysis, the
original data is decomposed into a series of modes with-
out requiring prior knowledge. Comparing with Fourier
and wavelet decomposition, EMD has its own advantage.
The Fourier analyses could transform data into the com-
bination of sine and cosine functions with different fre-
quencies, while wavelet analysis needs wavelet splines.
These types of decomposition involve many spurious
components due to serious restriction of the harmonic
nature of the basis function [10,17]. The EMD method
decomposes the data into several oscillatory compo-
nents, corresponding to some physical phenomenon
underlying the data, and the residual of the decompos-
ition is the trend of the data [10].
The model decomposed from EMD methods is called
the intrinsic mode function (IMF) [15,16].  An IMF
should satisfy two conditions [10,15]:  First, the differ-
ence between the number of extrema and the number of
zero-crossings in the whole data span should be less
than or equal to one. Second, the mean value of the en-
velope defined by the local maxima and the envelope de-
fined by the local minima is zero at any point. We
calculated the IMFs and the residuals of the density of
the malaria vectors using the sifting method by taking
the following steps:
Initialize r (t) = x(t), i = 0, k = 1, where x(t) is the time
series of density of the malaria vectors. We define a
threshold δ , the count of extreme points N.
Step1: Calculate the local maximum value and the
local minimum value of the time-series r(t);
Step2: Calculate the upper envelope emax
(t) through
interpolating the local maximum value, and the lower
envelope emin
(t) through interpolating the local mini-
mum value;
Step3: Calculate the local average value using the
formula: m(t) = (emax
(t) + emin
(t))/2;
Step4: Appoint i = i + 1, then the proto-mode function
(PMF) is calculated through the following formula:
pi
(t) = r(t) − m(t), r(t) = pi
(t);
Step 5: The termination condition is:
X
SD ¼

j  j pi
ð Þt − pi−1
ð Þt  2

If SD < δ, then imfk
(t) = pi
(t), go to the following step;
otherwise, go back to step 1–4;
Page 4
Huang et al. Parasites & Vectors (2015) 8:146  Page 4 of 9
Step 6: Appoint r(t) = r(t) − imfk
(t). If the count of ex-
treme points of r(t) is greater than N, then k = k + 1, i = 0,
and go back to step 1; otherwise, stop the sifting process.
The density series of malaria vectors x(t) can then be
expressed as:
XK
x t ð Þ ¼  imf i 
þ r

Where K is the number of IMFs and r is the trend of
the original data. The first IMF (IMF1) is the component
with the highest frequency. All of the IMFs were statisti-
cally tested against the null hypothesis [18]. In this re-
search, the EMD method was processed with the code
written by Rilling et al. [19]

Overview of the dataset
A total of 37,257 female anopheles were captured in the
62 surveillance sites during 3,720 nights of collecting
from 2005 to 2010, with a significant difference in the
distribution as well as density of different species. The
collections contained 4 species namely An.sinensis repre-
senting 96.25% (35,861/37,257),  An. lesteri 0.75% (278/ 
37,257),  An.dirus 1.49% (555/37,257) and An.minimus
1.51% (563/37,257).  The above observations indicated
the most widely distribution of An. sinensis in the all
surveillance sites (62 townships) of 18 provinces, but
showed great variation. It had a classic peak of abun-
dance each year in the rainy season (July-August), while
the other malaria vectors had the peak of abundance
during August-September in the surveillance sites during
2005–2010 (Figure 2).
The density of An. sinensis per site averaged 6.21 and
ranged between 0.40 and 107, the three highest density
of An. sinensis was observed at Quanzhou site (106.94
bites per man per night) in Guangxi Province, followed
by Jinxian (71.57 bites per man per night) and Wuyuan
(54.43 bites per man per night) in Jiangxi Province, while
the three lowest density of An. sinensis was found at
Jiangyang (1.06 bites per man per night), Qingshen (0.49
bites per man per night) and Junlian (0.40 bites per man
per night) in Sichuan Province (Figure 3A).
An. lesteri was found at 13 surveillance sites in 7 prov-
inces (Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, Hainan, Sichuan,
Guizhou and Yunnan),  with a peak of abundance each
year from June to July. The density per site averaged
0.45 and ranged from 0.03 to 2.29 bites per man per

night, the three highest density was observed at Anlu
(2.29 bites per man per night) in Hubei Province,
followed by Tongbai (0.80 bites per man per night) in
Henan Province and Baisha (0.78 bites per man per
night) in Hainan Province (Figure 3B).
An. minimus was captured at 13 national malaria sur-
veillance sites in 5 provinces (Fujian, Guangdong, Hainan,
Guizhou and Yunnan),with a peak of abundance each year
from July to September. The density of An. minimus per
site averaged 1.26 and ranged from 0.20 to 3.57 bites per
man per night, the two highest density was observed at
Menglian (3.57 bites per man per night) and Jinghong
(3.50 bites per man per night) from Yunnan Province
(Figure 3C).
An. dirus was captured at 8 national malaria surveil-
lance sites in 3 provinces (Guangdong, Guizhou and
Hainan). The density of An. dirus per site averaged 1.21
and ranged between 0.11 and 4.22 bites per man per
night, the highest density was observed at Zengcheng
(4.22 bites per man per night) in Guangdong Province, 
followed by Congjiang (1.76 bites per man per night) in
Guizhou Province (Figure 3D).
Clustering distribution
Since the density distribution of An. sinensis in some
sites was similar in the surveillance regions, kernel k-
means was used to identify these similarities, and three
distinct clusters were determined among the surveillance
regions based on CH value [10] (Figure 4).
The first cluster (low An. sinensis density) including 28
sentinel sites in 18 provinces was the most widely dis-
tributed with the lowest median density of 0.48 bites per
man per night comparing to the other two clusters, the
second cluster (medium An. sinensis density) was mainly
concentrated mostly in the central parts of China with
the median density of 1.67 bites per man per night, espe-
cially in Hubei and Anhui Provinces, the third cluster
(high An. sinensis density) was centralized in the
southeastern part of China such as Fujian, Zhejiang

and Jiangxi Provinces with highest median density of
5.03 bites per man per night (Table 1).
The temporal trend of identified clusters
During the surveillance period, a significant decrease in
An. sinensis density was found in the first as well as the
third cluster. In the first cluster, most decrease in the
density (from 0.53down to 0.39 bites per man per night)
occurred during 2005–2008 with little change between
2009 and 2010, while the decrease was significant (from
8.1 to 2.5 bites per man per night) in the third cluster
during the total surveillance period. However, an in-
crease of An. sinensis density was observed in the sec-
ond cluster during whole surveillance period with a

significant increase (from 1.4 to 1.7 bites per man per
night) during 2006–2009, while a little decrease in
2010, which was a big difference from the other two
clusters (Figure 5).
Discussion
Like many former studies [20-25] indicating four pri-
mary malaria vector species including An.sinensis, An.
lesteri, An.dirus and An.minimus existed in China, this
study also showed the same malaria vectors existing with
significant discrepancy of spatial distribution in the sur-
veillance regions.
Although An.sinensis is an inefficient vector mainly
because of its zoophilic habit, it is still considered an im-
portant vector of P. vivax malaria due to its wide distri-
bution as well as high density. Malaria transmission had
often taken place due to its high density under suitable
conditions such as the open plains in the greater part of
China between 25 ~ 33 north latitude [25-27].
An. lesteri was mainly distributed in low hill, hillock
and shallow hilly plain between 22 ~ 33 north latitude
which had still been found in 11 provinces with 205
counties through the survey conducted from 1998 to
Page 7

density) (C) third cluster (high density).
2001 [3]. However, An. lesteri had been captured only in
13 counties from 7 provinces (Henan, Hubei, Guang-
dong, Hainan, Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan) in the
surveillance sites during 2005–2010, indicating that the
spatial distribution of this vector became smaller than
before. The extensive agricultural use of pesticides and
indoor insecticide spraying may have substantially re-
duced its distribution [23,28,29].
An.minimus had long been regarded as a principal
malaria vector in China. In the past, mosquitoes of the
An. minimus group were recorded from 16 provinces in
southern China including Sichuan, Chongqing, Hubei,
Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi,
Hainan, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hong Kong
and Taiwan throughout southern China from Yunnan
Province eastward and from Hainan Island northward to
approximately 32.5 north latitude [30-33]. However, An.
minimus was captured only in 5 provinces (Fujian, 
Guangdong, Hainan, Guizhou and Yunnan) from the
surveillance sites during 2005–2010. It is still a major
malaria vector in the hilly bordering regions of Yunnan
Province near Myanmar [33].
In China, An.leucosphyrus was found for the first time
by the writer in 1941 in Yunnan [34]. It was then recti-
fied to An.dirus, a new species described by Peyton and
Harrison [35], based on the detailed morphological com-
parison of specimens from Thailand. However, different
from previous research that An.dirus had been captured
from four provinces of Hainan, Yunnan, Guangxi and
Tibet [36],  it was only captured at 8 national malaria
surveillance sites during 2005–2010 from 3 provinces
(Guangdong, Guizhou and Hainan). An.dirus has so far
been known as a malaria vector only on Hainan Island.
Further, this is the first study to systematically explore
the temporal-spatial dynamics of An.sinensis in China
using kernel k-means based on CH value [10].  The
Page 8
Huang et al. Parasites & Vectors (2015) 8:146  Page 8 of 9
significant difference of population density may have
resulted from available resources that more rice fields
in the southern part of China than the others contrib-
uting to the suitable breeding sites of An.sinensis [37].
Different from the first and third cluster that a signifi-
cant decrease of An. sinensis density was observed, the
second cluster displayed a significant increase during
2005–2010 in the central part of China, which the increas-
ing vectorial capacity leading to malaria re-emergence in
Huang-Huai River of central China may be related to this
change [38,39].
Conclusion
As malaria transmission relies mainly on Anopheles mos-
quitoes, the present results will serve as a baseline for the
ongoing NMEP in China, which will help to address the
knowledge gaps with respect to the malaria profile under
different settings.
