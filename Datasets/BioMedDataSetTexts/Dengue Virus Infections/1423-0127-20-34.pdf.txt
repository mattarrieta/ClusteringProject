Immunologic hypo- or non-responder in natural
dengue virus infection
Guey Chuen Perng1,2,3* and Kulkanya Chokephaibulkit4
Abstract
Serologically defined primary dengue virus infection and/or subsequent homologous serotype infection is known to be
associated with less severe disease as compared with secondary subsequent heterologous serotype infection. In
geographical locales of high dengue endemicity, almost all individuals in the population are infected at some point in
time and should therefore are at high risk of secondary infection. Interestingly, dengue viremia in healthy blood donors
whose sera apparently lack detectable levels of specific antibody to dengue viral antigens has been reported. The
incidence rate of potential immunologic hypo- or non-responders following natural primary dengue virus infection in
dengue endemic regions, who do become immune responders only after repeated exposure, has not been described.
These are the patients who may be diagnosed as primary infection in the subsequent infection, but actually are
secondary infection. This concept has important implications with regards to the hypothesis of immunological
enhancement of dengue pathogenesis, which has largely been advanced based on empirical observations and/or from
in vitro experimental assays. The fact that dengue naïve travelers can suffer from severe dengue upon primary exposure
while visiting dengue endemic countries underscores one of the major problems in explaining the role of immune
enhancement in the pathogenesis of severe dengue virus infection. This evidence suggests that the mechanism(s)
leading to severe dengue may not be associated with pre-existing enhancing antibody. Consequently, we propose a
new paradigm for dengue virus infection classification. These include a) patients with naïve primary infection, b) those
that are serologically defined primary in dengue endemic zones and c) those who are serologically defined secondary
dengue virus infection. We submit that clarity with regards to such definitions may help facilitate the delineation of the
potential mechanisms of severe dengue virus infection.

Review
Dengue is one of the most important vector-borne hu-
man diseases globally as well as a major public health
burden and threat. There are four distinct viral sero-
types, each one of them is capable of causing a wide
spectrum of dengue manifestations including plasma
leakage and shock with multi-organ failure. The resur-
gence of the dengue endemnicity has resulted from
numerous oscillating environmental, social and eco-
nomical factors. Two-fifths of the world’s population
is at risk of dengue virus infection, with approximately
one-half million requiring hospitalization, with an

estimated 25,000 deaths annually, according to the
WHO. Currently, there are no effective antiviral mo-
dalities and/or preventive vaccines available to com-
bat or control dengue virus infection. The precise
mechanism by which only a small percentage of den-
gue virus infected individuals progessing to severe
dengue disease remains poorly understood.
The pathophysiology of severe dengue virus infection
is very complex and may involve multiple factors. One
of the factors believed to play a role in the pathogenesis
of severe dengue disease is the presence of pre-existing
dengue reactive antibody as available data from dengue
epidemic countries have indicated that severe disease
more frequently occurs during subsequent viral infec-
tions with a different dengue serotype [1,2],  as defined
by the standard serological test. However, recent results
obtained from non-dengue endemic regions [3] and

from travelers suggest that the frequency of severe den-
gue diseases during primary infection in immune-naive
individuals is similar to that of heterologous secondary
infections in endemic areas [4]. The immune enhance-
ment theory is further put to question by the study by
Libraty et al [5] which included a cohort study that re-
vealed the lack of an association between maternal anti-
bodies and development of severe dengue in infected
infants. Collectively, the evidence suggests that as yet
undefined factor(s) play a critical role in the develop-
ment of severe dengue in naïve primary infection. We
submit that the cause of severe pathology in truly
naïve individuals infected by dengue virus may be 
distinguishable from that of serologically defined primary
infection in dengue endemic zones.
According to the WHO guidelines, it is required that
paired specimens from individual patients be simultan-
eously processed to clearly define the infection as pri-
mary or secondary in dengue endemic regions. But, very
often, paired-sample collection is impractical in routine
clinical practice. This limitation has led to the definition
of primary and secondary infection in dengue endemic
zones by the analysis of the ratio of IgM/IgG on a single
sample; if the value is >1.2, then it is a primary infection,
but if the value is ≤1.2, it is noted as a secondary infec-
tion. Epidemiologically, serological surveillance studies

have revealed that about 85 to 95% of school-aged
children in endemic countries are positive for dengue
IgG antibody [2,6,7].  Interestingly, a recent report [8]
demonstrates that dengue viremia can exist in healthy
blood donors whose sera apparently lack detectable
levels of specific antibody to dengue virus (Table 1), and
the incidence varies, ranging from 0.7/1000 to 4.5/1000,
dependent upon season and year [9]. Thus, besides the
use of the IgM/IgG ratio, it is difficult at best to distin-
guish between primary and secondary infection. It is fur-
ther complicated by the incidence of non-classical
serologic responses, in which the ratio value is often
slightly below 1.2. Such cases are very often arbitrarily
assigned as secondary infection, and thus the definition
has been called into question [10].  The fact that there
exist asymptomatic dengue viremia positive but antibody
undetectable individuals in dengue endemic geographical
locales, presents an important challenge to the blood
supply of that region [11-13]. Dengue inapparent infec-
tion has been documented in literature since 1939, in
which volunteers intravenously received serum taken
from an acute dengue patient, but no clinical symptoms
were observed, and yet serum taken from this subject
was able to infect a new healthy volunteer. Hence the
term dengue inapparent infection was instituted [14].
Interestingly, it has been proposed that asymptomatic
dengue cases may account for the introduction and
spread of dengue viruses in non-endemic regions [15].
Consequently, the cumulative evidence suggests that
asymptomatic viremia may have an important role in
dengue transmission and warrant a more in depth
investigation.
Within the context of diagnoses that are based on sero-
logical tests, it is important to note the results that have
been recorded following routine vaccinations. The esti-
mated frequency of immunologic non-responders among
Hepatitis B vaccine and Venezuelan equine encephalitis
(VEE) vaccine recipients is around 1-10% [16-18] and about
18-26% [19], respectively. However, the occurrence of such
non-responders following natural Hepatitis B or VEE in-
fection has not so far been investigated or documented.
Furthermore, although the frequency of hypo- or non-
responders in natural dengue virus infection has never
been explored, recent data accumulated from screening
of healthy blood donors living in a dengue endemic zone
suggest that the incidence ranges from 4.5 to 0.7 per
1000 donors [9]. In addition, extrapolation of cumulative
data of seroconversion following monovalent or tetrava-
lent dengue vaccine trials suggested that hypo- or non-
responders after a single dose of vaccine was found to
be between 15 to 22% (Figure 1),  regardless where the
trials are performed. Epidemiologically, the prevalence
of IgM and/or IgG negative individuals reported in
serological studies conducted in dengue endemic 
Figure 1 Frequency of immunologic non-responders derived
from vaccinees received one dose of monovalent or tetravalent
dengue vaccines. Cumulative data were gathered from numerous
resources with complete information given in dengue vaccine
clinical trials [35-52]. The frequency of immunologic non-responders
is inferred from the rate of seroconversion after one dose in
these vaccinees.
regions indicates that the range is 1 to 10% among
populations in various geographical areas [6,7,20-26].
These data suggest that subjects that are initially im-
mune non-responders may be re-challenged repeat-
edly with the incoming virus throughout their lives in
endemic countries. Interestingly, it has been docu-
mented that the frequency of reattack rate in dengue
endemic regions or during an outbreak is about 1:20,
or 5-8% [27-32].  Coincidentally, the seroconversion
rate in dengue vaccine trials can be up to 90 to 99%
after the 2nd and 3rd dose [33,34]. Consequently, several
pragmatic questions can be asked; should immunologic
non-responders after being re-challenged be defined as
primary or secondary infection in dengue endemic regions?
Will these non-responders develop severe dengue after re-
peated exposures with the virus in the natural setting?
These questions should be thoughtfully considered and
investigated.
One of avenues that can be linked to the immune
non-responder is genetic polymorphism in ethnic ori-
gin of populations and perhaps in a specific individual.

In a general term, immune related genetic polymor-
phisms are much more likely contributing to the phe-
nomena. These include genes for human leukocyte
antigens (HLA) or major histocompatibility class, for
antibody genes, for cytokines, for Toll-like receptors or
receptors in pathogen pattern recognition and others
[53,54].  Some of these genetic polymorphisms have
been associated with quality of immune response and
viral disease development, as well as that found in indi-
viduals who are hypo- or non-responders to hepatitis
B vaccination [55-62].  Recent evidence suggests that
defective in antigen intake by the antigen-presenting
cells and/or unable to present antigen properly and ad-
equately is not a cause of non-responsiveness to hepa-
titis B surface antigen from HLA polymorphism [63].
Scientifically, the cascade and complexity of immune re-
sponses in pathogen- or vaccine-induced can be highly
variable among individuals. Consequently, any genes
within the immune response network would potentially
contribute to the pleiotropic variation seen in an infected
population or vaccinees.
As for how to differentiate the naïve primary infection
from hypo/non-responder when no host gene bio-
markers are currently available, a number of methods
have been proposed. These include a) analysis of an in-
dividual’s genetic background and HLA typing, b)
performing a much more laborious laboratory test such
as the identification of a molecular signature using
whole genome transcriptional analysis in PBMC [64] or
c) the assessment of CD4+ T cell subsets, CD31+thymic
naïve CD4+ T cells, a prognostic marker for immune
competence [65]. Thus, in order to further advance the
understanding of the pathogenesis of severe dengue,
three major categories, naïve primary infection, sero-
logically defined primary infection in endemic zones,
and secondary infection, are suggested and should be
implemented where it is applicable in the interpretation
of results.
The presence of different dengue serotypes and a
sub-genotype group within a serotype are the well-
established complexity in dengue. Each serotype or
sub-genotype is capable of inducing typical dengue
diseases. Although some sub-genotypes may induce
severe dengue more often than others [66,67],
dependent upon geographical zones, the concept on
the immune nonresponder in dengue endemic regions
has not been established in spite of epidemiologically
results indicate that repeating exposure with alternate
viral serotype correlates with dengue severity [68].
Consequently, in dengue endemic zones, is severe
dengue a result of alternate heterologous infection in
the prior exposure individual or a non-responder con-
stantly re-challenged by circulating virus remains to be
investigated. Currently, there is no assay that can 
differentiate the sequence of serotype infections in an
individual [69]. Therefore, diagnostic tool that can effi-
ciently differentiate the previous infected serotype
prior to current other serotype infection is urgently
needed.
Conclusion
The ability to identify and distinguish these 3 categories
will shed new light on the development of better diag-
nostic tools, mitigation of the threat to the blood supply
in dengue-endemic countries, and pave a new avenue for
molecular processes of immune development in the de-
sign and generation of modern vaccines. Furthermore,
with a clearer definition of the virus pre-exposure, the
search for better diagnostic marker and the identity of
the pathogenic cause for severe dengue may be much
simpler and faster to reach a consensus which would
greatly facilitate the institution of effective and appropri-
ate preventive medicine strategy.
