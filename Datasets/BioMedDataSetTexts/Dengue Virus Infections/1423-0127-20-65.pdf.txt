Abstract
Background: We and others have reported that autophagy is induced by dengue viruses (DVs) in various cell lines,
and that it plays a supportive role in DV replication. This study intended to clarify whether DV infection could
induce autophagy in vivo. Furthermore, the effect of DV induced autophagy on viral replication and DV-related
pathogenesis was investigated.
Results and conclusions: The physiopathological parameters were evaluated after DV2 was intracranially injected
into 6-day-old ICR suckling mice. Autophagy-related markers were monitored by immunohistochemical/
immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting. Double-membrane autophagic vesicles were investigated by
transmission-electron-microscopy. DV non-structural-protein-1 (NS1) expression (indicating DV infection) was
detected in the cerebrum, medulla and midbrain of the infected mice. In these infected tissues, increased LC3
puncta formation, LC3-II expression, double-membrane autophagosome-like vesicles (autophagosome), amphisome,
and decreased p62 accumulation were observed, indicating that DV2 induces the autophagic progression in vivo.
Amphisome formation was demonstrated by colocalization of DV2-NS1 protein or LC3 puncta and mannose-6
-phosphate receptor (MPR, endosome marker) in DV2-infected brain tissues. We further manipulated DV-induced
autophagy by the inducer rapamycin and the inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3MA), which accordingly promoted or
suppressed the disease symptoms and virus load in the brain of the infected mice.
We demonstrated that DV2 infection of the suckling mice induces autophagy, which plays a promoting role in DV
replication and pathogenesis.

Background
DV is a positive single-strand RNA virus which belongs to
the Flaviviridae family, and is composed of four serotypes
(DV1 to 4). It is transmitted to vertebrate hosts via the
mosquito vector Aedes aegypti and A. albopictus.  DV
causes over 390 million infections every year, and is one of
the most important arboviruses causing human diseases
[1].  The symptoms of DV infection range from mild
dengue fever (DF) to life-threatening dengue haemorrhagic
fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Generally
speaking, DF is self-limited, but in a small proportion of

people the disease may proceed to severe DHF/DSS.
Diverse hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
pathologic mechanism of DHF/DSS, but the findings
remain contradictory.
Autophagy participates in the degradation of long-lived
and aggregated protein as well as damaged organelles in
the cytoplasm to maintain homeostasis. Autophagy is
characterized by a double-membrane vesicle known as an
autophagosome, which recruits cytoplasmic materials
and fuses with lysosome for protein degradation [2].
Autophagy is classified as macroautophagy, microautophagy,
and chaperon-mediated autophagy, depending on how it
delivers the cargo to lysosome and its physiological function
[3]. Aberrant autophagic activities lead to the pathogenesis of
various diseases, including diabetes, neurodegeneration, heart
disease, and cancers. Tian et al., reported that autophagy was
detected in brain sections of a GFP-LC3 transgenic mouse

model after transient cerebral ischemia and demonstrated a
relationship between autophagy and apoptosis [4,5]. Dengue
virus infection induces apoptosis in various cell lines
and clinical patient specimens [6].  However, dengue
virus-induced apoptosis and its relationship with autophagy
remain to be determined.
Beclin1 serves as a platform to recruit other regulatory
molecules of C3-PI3K complex, including Atg14-like
protein (Atg14L),  UV irradiation resistance-associated
gene (UVRAG),  Bax-interacting factor-1 (Bif-1) and
activating molecule in Beclin-1-regulated autophagy
protein-1 (Ambra-1) [7-10].  During vesicle elongation,
two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems are activated.
First, Atg12 is covalently conjugated with Atg5 by E1-like
enzyme Atg7 and E2-like enzyme Atg10. Second, Atg5
binds to Atg16L1, a coiled-coil domain-containing protein,
to form a heterotrimeric complex, Atg5-Atg12-Atg16L1.
This complex is responsible for the expansion of the
phagophore and is dissociated from the membrane when
autophagosome formation is completed. Microtubule-
associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3) (mammalian
homologue of yeast Atg8) is initially cleaved by Atg4, a cyst-
eine protease, followed by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)
modification on the carboxyl terminus of the cleaved LC3
[11]. The lipidated LC3 located on the membrane facilitates
autophagosome maturation. The autophagosome may fuse
with the endosome to form the amphisome or with the
lysosome to form the autophagolysosome [12-14].
Autophagy is also involved in the host immunity
against pathogen infection [15].  Autophagy acts as an
anti-viral component of the innate immune system and
is induced by the ligands of the toll-like receptors [16].
Furthermore, autophagy enhances the presentation of
viral antigens by dendritic cells during the infection of
Sendai and vesicular stomatitis viruses [17]. Autophagy
can also function in the adaptive immune response by
enhancing the presentation of antigen onto MHC class
II molecules [18-20]. Autophagy not only plays an anti-
viral role, but also shows pro-viral functions [21,22].
Poliovirus, coxsackievirus B3, hepatitis C virus (HCV),
coronavirus, enterovirus 71 and DV activate autophagy
to elevate viral replication [23-28]. HCV uses autophagy
for the early protein translation and suppresses the
innate antiviral immunity [23,29]. The double membrane
of the autophagosome may support poliovirus replication
[30],  and the autophagic machinery is utilized for the
replication of coronaviruses [25,31]. DV infection increases
autophagic activity to enhance viral replication, indicating
the use of autophagosome as the docking site for viral repli-
cation complex or as the organelle for lipid metabolism to
provide ATP energy for DV replication [25,32-35]. Autoph-
agy induction by NS4A protein of DV prevents the infected
cell from death and enhances viral replication [35]. While it
is known that autophagy plays an important role in DV 
replication in vitro, the role of autophagy in vivo has not
been reported. This study focused on autophagic activity,
virus titer and pathogenesis in DV2 infection of the
suckling mice.
Methods
Dengue virus and mice
The DV2 (strain PL046) was routinely maintained in A.
albopictus-derived cell line C6/36 (purchased from
ATCC). Breeder mice of the ICR strain were purchased
from the National Laboratory Animal Center, Taiwan.
The mice were maintained at the Animal Facility of Na-
tional Cheng Kung University, Taiwan, and were manip-
ulated according to the animal experiment guidelines of
the National Science Council, Taiwan. Six-day-old suck-
ling mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 2.5×105
pfu of active or heat-inactivated DV2 or control
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (GIBCO
BRL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) containing 2% fetal bo-
vine serum (FBS). The mice were sacrificed and perfused
with isotonic saline containing EDTA. For plaque assay,
the brain tissues were collected, weighed and homog-
enized in 1 ml of DMEM containing 2% FBS. The
supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 8000
rpm for 15 min at 4°C and frozen at −70°C. For
Western blot analysis, the brain tissues were homoge-
nized with 1 ml of Radio-immunoprecipitation assay
(RIPA) lysis buffer (50mM Tris, 150mM NaCl, 0.1%
SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100,
PMSF, pH7-8) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
The supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 14000
rpm for 20 min at 4°C and frozen at −70°C. For IFA and
IHC assays, the brain tissues were embedded in
Tissue-Tek O. C. T. compound (Sankura Finetek,
Torrance, CA, USA),  frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at −70°C. Serial coronal sections (5 μm) were cut
on a cryostat (Leica CM1800, Heidelberg, Germany)
and mounted on a silanized slide (Dako, Carpinteria,
CA, USA).
Plaque assay
BHK-21 cells were plated in a 12-well plate (9×104 cells/well)
and cultured in DMEM (GIBCO).  After adsorption
for 2 h with serially diluted virus solutions, the solu-
tion was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 2%
FBS and 0.8% methyl cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich).  At
four days post-infection, the medium was removed
and the cells were fixed and stained with the crystal
violet solution consisting of 1% crystal violet, 0.64%
NaCl, and 2% formalin for 1 h at room temperature
(RT).  Finally, the crystal violet was removed and the
plate was washed with the tap water. The viral titer
was determined by the plaque assay [25].

Immunohistochemostry staining (IHC) and
immunofluorescence assay (IFA)
Mice brain sections were fixed with acetone and
blocked with 3% H2
O2 
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany)
in methanol. The sections were blocked with SuperBlock
(SuperBlock blocking buffer in PBS; Thermo Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA) or Vector M.O.M mouse immuno-
globulin G blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA) for 1 h at RT. The sections
were further incubated with the anti-DV2-NS1 antibody
(ab41632, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA), anti-autophagy
LC3 antibody (AP1802a, Abgent, San Diego, CA, USA) or
anti-Beclin 1 antibody (ab62472, Abcam),  which was
diluted in blocking buffer overnight at 4°C. The sections
were further incubated with biotinylated secondary
antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 1 h at RT
and stained with AEC Substrate Chromogen (Dako).
DAPI (4′-6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole; Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) was used to stain the nuclei of the brain
cells. Subsequently, the slides were immersed in hematoxylin
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for counterstaining and
then rinsed in tap water for 10 min. Finally, the slides
were mounted with Dako Faramount Aqueous Mounting
Medium (Dako).
For the immunofluorescence assay, the section after
the primary antibody treatment was incubated with
the secondary antibody conjugated with red (A11004,
Invitrogen, Eugene, Oregon, USA) or green (A11008,
Invitrogen) fluorescence. Subsequently, the slide was
stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich). Finally, the
sections were mounted and examined under a laser
confocal scanning microscope (Olympus FluoView FV1000,
CenterValley, PA, USA).
Transmission electron microscopy
DV2 (2.5 x 105 pfu/mouse) was intracranially injected
into the brain of six-day-old ICR suckling mice. The
clinical score and body weight were measured every day.
Five mice were treated with live DV2, three were treated
with heat inactive DV2 (iDV2),  and three mice were
treated with the culture medium. At five days post-
infection, mice were sacrificed after anesthesia with 7%
chloral hydrate followed by perfusion with 4% parafor-
maldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer (PB). After fixation,
the cervical spinal cord was removed and kept in PB
solution overnight at 4°C. The cervical cord was cut into
100 μm sections and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in
0.1 M cacodylate buffer (4% sucrose, 1 mM MgCl2 
and 1
mM CaCl2
)  and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide
(Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA, USA). The
sections were then dehydrated in a series dilutions of
ethanol and embedded with LR White (Agar Scientific,
Stansted, UK). Ultrathin sections were obtained using an
ultramicrotome (Reichert-Jung, Heidelberg, Germany) 
and stained with saturated aqueous uranyl acetate
(Electron Microscopy Sciences) and lead citrate (Electron
Microscopy Sciences) at RT, and then investigated
under a Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron microscope
(Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).
Western blot analysis
Cells were cultured and infected with DV2, and the total
cell extracts harvested at various time points were
subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS PAGE).  The separated proteins in
the gel were electrically transferred to a PVDF membrane
(Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), followed by hybridization
with their corresponding specific primary antibodies
(anti-LC3: PM036, MBL, Woburn, MA, USA; anti-Beclin
1: sc-11427, Santa Cruz, CA, USA; anti-p62: Santa Cruz;
anti-β-actin: A5441, Sigma-Aldrich) and the secondary
antibodies (Goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugated
Ab: AP124P and Goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP conju-
gated: AP132P, Chemicon, Billerica, MA, USA).  After
incubation with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
solution (Millipore) for 1 min, the membrane was exposed
to an X-ray film (Eastman Kodak, NY, USA).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. Dif-
ferences between the test and control groups were analyzed
by the Student’s t test using the Prism software. Significance
was set at p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**) and p < 0.05 (***).
Results
Dengue virus type 2 infection of the ICR suckling mice
causes physiopathological changes
We and others have demonstrated that dengue virus
infection of various human cell lines induces autophagy,
which further promotes virus replication [25,33,36].  In
order to establish the role of DV2 infection in the induction
of autophagy as well as its roles in DV replication and
DV-related pathogenesis in vivo, DV2 or UV-inactivated
DV2 (iDV2) (2.5×105  pfu/mouse) was intracranially
injected into six-day-old ICR suckling mice. The body
weight, clinical score, and survival rate of the infected
mice were measured daily for seven days. The body weight
of DV2-infected mice was greatly decreased from day 5
to day 7 post infection (p.i) as compared to the mock-
infected and iDV2-infected groups (Figure 1A).  The
disease symptoms progressed from mild sickness (losing
weight and ruffled hair) at days 2 and 3 to severe paralysis
and mortally ill at day 5 p.i., and mice started to die in the
DV2-infected group, whereas no deaths were noted in the
mock- and iDV2-treated groups at day 6 p.i. (Figure 1B).
The survival rate in the DV2-infected mice was 40% at
day 6 p.i and all of the mice died at day 7 p.i., but no mice
died in the other two groups (Figure 1C). To verify that

Figure 1 Dengue-2 virus infection induces physiopathological changes of the ICR mice. Six-day-old ICR suckling mice were intracranially
inoculated with DV2 (2.5×105 pfu/mouse). The (A) body weight (B) clinical score and (C) survival rate were monitored daily after inoculation. (D)
The mice were sacrificed at day 5 p.i. The brain tissues were cryosectioned and DV2-NS1 expression in various regions of the mouse brain was
detected with anti-DV NS1 antibody by IHC staining. Arrow points NS1 labeling. Disease symptoms were scored as follows: 0 for healthy; 1 for
lightly sick (losing weight and ruffled hair); 2 for slow-moving and reduced mobility; 3 for moving with difficulty and anterior limb or posterior
limb weakness; 4 for paralysis and mortally ill; 5 for death. Mock group was treated with 2% FBS/DMEM and iDV2 group was the virus subjected
to heat treatment at 56°C for 30 min. The numbers of mice in each group were from 3 to 5. Data were analyzed using the Student’s t test.
Significance was set at p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), p < 0.05 (***).
the abovementioned disease symptoms were indeed caused
by dengue virus infection, NS1 protein, an indicator of DV
infection, was detected by anti-NS1 antibody in the brain
tissues, including the cerebrum, medulla and midbrain of
the infected mice, but no NS1 antigen was seen in the
cerebellum and pons (Figure 1D, arrow). Altogether, DV2
was shown to be capable of infecting the brain tissue of the
ICR mice, and of causing severe disease symptoms leading
to death.
Dengue virus induces amphisome and autophagosome
formation as well as autophagic flux in the brain of
infected mice
The aforementioned data showed that DV-NS1 antigen
was detected in the brain tissues of the infected mice
(Figure 1).  In order to establish that autophagy was
induced in these DV2-infected mice, aggregation 
(puncta formation) of endogenous LC3 protein (a marker
of autophagy) and DV2 NS1 expression in the brain tissue
were assessed. The increased green fluorescent LC3 puncta,
representing autophagosome formation, and the increased
red fluorescent, representing DV-NS1 expression, were
detected in the DV2-infected mice brain as compared to
levels found in the mock-infected mice (Figure 2A, lower
panels). Furthermore, colocalization of green LC3 puncta
and red DV2-NS1 was seen in the brain sections of the
infected mice (Figure 2A, arrow),  suggesting that
autophagosome formation was induced and that NS1,
as a component of the replication complex working
in concert with autophagosomes, may participate in DV
replication. The expression levels of DV2 NS1 and LC3 II
protein (a marker of autophagosome formation) in the
brain were increased only in DV2-infected mice at days 5
and 6 p.i. compared with mock-and iDV2-infected mice.

Figure 2 Dengue-2 virus infection induces LC3 puncta formation and increases LC3 II expression in the mouse brain tissue. As in
Figure 1, DV2 was injected into the six-day-old suckling mice. (A) At day 5 p.i., the brain tissues were sectioned and the expression of DV2-NS1
and LC3 in the mouse brain tissue was determined with anti-DV NS1 and anti-LC3 antibodies by IFA staining under the confocal microscope
(Olympus FluoView 1000). DAPI was used to stain the nucleus of the cell. Arrow points indicate the colocalization of NS1 and LC3. (B) The brain
tissues of the mice used in (A) were harvested and total protein lysate was collected at various times p.i. and analyzed by Western blotting to
measure the expression of DV2-NS1 and LC3 with the anti-DV NS1 and anti-LC3 antibodies. The numbers under each band are the quantification
of LC3II band intensity after normalization with β-actin.
This result further supports the finding showing that
DV induces autophagy in vivo (Figure 2B),  and these
phenomena were not seen in the heat-inactivated
DV2 infection and mock control groups. This finding
indicates that autophagy induction requires active DV
infection and/or replication. Beclin 1, a coiled-coil
protein, interacts with Bcl-2 and plays a critical role
during autophagy progression [37].  However, in this
in vivo study, Beclin 1 expression was not changed either
in infected or in mock-infected mice brains by Western
blotting at days 3, 5 and 6 p.i. and IHC assay at day 5 p.i.
(Additional file 1: A and B, arrow). In summary, the role
of Beclin 1 in DV2-induced autophagy requires further
confirmation. The double-membrane autophagosome-like
vesicles (V) were detected in the brain tissue of DV2-
infected mice (Figure 3C, 3D and 3E, arrow),  but not
in the mock-infected group (Mock) (Figure 3A and 3B)
under transmission electron microscopy. This double-
membrane ultrastructure further supports the result show-
ing that DV induces autophagy in vivo. We further detected
the colocalization of green LC3 puncta and red MPR in
the brain tissue of DV2-infected mice, indicating fusion 
of endosome with autophagosome to form amphisome
(Figure 4A, arrow). We also observed the colocalization of
DV2 NS1 (red) and MPR (green fluorescence, a marker of
endosome) protein in brain sections under fluorescent
microscopy, indicating that DV2 existed in the endosome
(Figure 4B, arrow),  which is consistent with an in vitro
investigation by Panyasrivanit et al. that showed dengue
virus was recruited into the endosome, which was then
fused with the autophagosome to form amphisomes [36].
The data described above demonstrate that DV2 infection
in vivo can induce autophagy and amphisome formation.
The polyubiquitin-binding protein p62/SQSTM1
interacts with the ubiquitinated cargo protein followed by
binding with LC3, and then is transported into the
autophagosomes for degradation. The degradation of p62
has been used as an indicator of autophagic progression
from autophagosome to autophagolysosome. To further
confirm that DV2 infection indeed induces autophagic
progression in vivo,  the kinetics of LC3, p62, and NS1
expression level in two representative mice were evaluated
at days 3 and day 5 p.i. by Western blotting. When the
expression level of LC3II was induced at days 3 and 5 p.i.,

conducted in this study. The brain tissues were collected and investigated by TEM. (A) Mock group was treated with DMEM containing 2% FBS.

the expression of p62 was decreased in the DV2-infected
group compared to that of the mock-infected group
(Figure 5, 0.59 vs. 0.94 and 0.70 vs. 0.83, respectively).
Furthermore, 3-MA was used to block DV2-induced
autophagy, and the degradation level of p62 was reversed
in the DV2 infection group at days 3 and day 5 p.i.
(Figure 5, 0.73 vs. 0.59 at day 3, and 1.00 vs. 0.7 at
day 5).  These data indicate that an autophagic flux
was induced during DV2 infection in vivo. Taken together,
these findings demonstrate formation of amphisome and
autophagosome, as well as the autophagic flux were
induced in the DV2-infected brain tissues of the mice.
Regulation of autophagy affects DV-related pathogenesis
of suckling mice during dengue virus infection
We have demonstrated that 3-MA suppresses autophagy
and reduces DV replication in vitro [25].  To further
investigate the effect of autophagy on DV2-related
pathogenesis, mice were pretreated with 3-MA (80μg/g),
rapamycin (0.15μg/g),  or PBS (Mock) by intracranial
injection two hours before DV2 infection. The expression
of LC3-II protein was suppressed by about 18% at days 3 
and 5 p.i. in the 3-MA treated group (DV2+3MA) as
compared to that of the DV2-infected group (Figure 5).
The viral titer in the brain of the mice pre-treated with
3-MA was not significantly decreased at days 3 and 5
p.i. (Figure 6A).  However, in the group treated with
autophagy inducer rapamycin (DV2+Rapa),  the viral
titer was significantly elevated as compared to that of the
DV infection group at day 5 p.i. (Figure 6B). Furthermore,
with the addition of 3-MA to block autophagy, the clinical
scores were decreased at days 5 and day 6 p.i. in the
DV2-infected mice (DV2+3MA) as compared to that of
the DV2 infection and mock infection groups (Figure 7A).
Accordingly, in the presence of the autophagy inducer
rapamycin, the clinical scores of DV2 infection group
(DV2+Rapa) were significantly increased at day 5 p.i.
compared to those of the DV2 infection and mock infec-
tion groups (Figure 7B). The survival rate of DV2-infected
mice that received 3-MA treatment was increased to 40%
as compared to 20% in the DV2 infection group at day 6
p.i. (Figure 7C).  In contrast, the survival rate of the
rapamycin-treated group (DV2+Rapa) dropped to 40% as
compared to 71% in the DV2 infection group at day 5 p.i.

Figure 4 DV2 infection of mice brain induces amphisome formation. The same treatment used in the above figures was conducted. The
expression of NS1, the endosome marker MPR, and the autophagosome marker LC3 protein in the sections of the mice brain tissue was shown
by IFA staining under a confocal microscope using specific antibodies followed by secondary fluorescent conjugation. The DAPI was used to
indicate the nucleus of the cells. (A) colocalization of LC3 (green) and MPR (red); (B) colocalization of NS1 (red) and MPR (green). Arrow points

(Figure 7D). Both 3-MA and rapamycin showed no effect
on DV2 infection-related loss of body weight in the mice
(Additional file 2: A and B).  In summary, regulation of
autophagy in vivo during dengue virus infection could
influence physiopathological parameters, including disease
symptoms, survival rate, and viral titer.
Discussion
This study showed that in ICR suckling mice, DV2 can
indeed infect the brain tissue at various regions detected
by anti-DV-NS1 antibody at five days p.i. (Figure 1D),
which is consistent with the results of our previous report 
that showed DV2 antigen was detected in the brain and
liver of the infected mice [38]. However, DV-NS1 antigen
was not detected in the cerebellum and pons of the
infected mice (Figure 1D). DV2 infection of the brain of
2-day-old Swiss mice induces apoptosis, and dengue
virus antigen was detected in the cortical and hippocampal
regions [39].  Amaral et al. reported that NS3-positive
cells could be visualized throughout the parenchyma
including the cerebrum, brainstem, and cerebellum in
the 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice [40].  The discrepancy
between our results and those reported in other studies
may be attributed to differences in the strain of mouse or
Figure 5 Autophagic flux is induced in the brain tissue of DV2-infected mice. The six-day-old ICR suckling mice were pre-treated with 3-MA
(80μg/g) or PBS by intracranial inoculation followed by DV2 (2.5 x 105 pfu/mouse) inoculation 2 h later. The brain tissues of two mice from each
group were harvested and total protein lysate was collected at day 3 and day 5 p.i. and analyzed by Western blotting to measure the expression
levels of LC3I, LC3II, p62, and DV2-NS1. The numbers under each band are the quantification and the mean of the intensity of LC3II, p62, and NS1
bands after normalization with β-actin.

pre-treated with 3-MA (80μg/g), rapamycin (0.15μg/g), or PBS by intracranial inoculation, followed by DV2 (2.5 x 105 pfu/mouse) inoculation 2 h
later. Plaque assay was conducted to measure the viral titer in DV2-infected mice brain tissue at day 3 and day 5 p.i. in (A) together with 3-MA
(DV2+3MA) and at day 5 p.i. in (B) together with rapamycin (DV2+Rapa). PBS-treated group is shown as DV2.
virus, age disparity of the mice, and inoculation titer of
the viruses. Taken together, the findings described above
indicate that dengue virus could infect various regions of
the brain and cause disease symptoms. Our findings are
consistent with those of previous reports [39,40].
The results showed that DV2 infection of mouse brain
induces autophagy as demonstrated by increased LC3-II
protein expression in the brain tissues of DV2-infected
mice (Figure 2B),  LC3 protein aggregation, and colo-
calization of DV2-NS1 and LC3 in DV2-infected brain
section (Figure 2A),  as well as the double-membrane
(autophagosome) vesicle formation under TEM (Figure 3C,
3D, and 3E), which was similar to the findings of our previ-
ous in vitro report [25].  Fusion of autophagosome with 
endosome to form amphisome was also detected in dengue
virus-infected mouse brain (Figure 4), which was consistent
with the result of an in vitro investigation by Panyasrivanit
et al. that showed that the endosome harboring dengue
viruses fuses with the autophagosome to form amphisome,
which serves as the docking site of the viral replication
complex [36].  Welsch et al. revealed that dengue virus
modifies the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane struc-
ture to promote its replication and efficient encapsidation
of the genome into progeny virus under electron tomog-
raphy [41].  Miller and Krijnse-Locker reported that viral
replication complexes form clusters around the double
membrane vesicles, which are formed by contiguous inva-
gination of the ER [42].  The aforementioned reports
Figure 7 Manipulation of autophagy by 3-MA or rapamycin affects the clinical score and survival rate of DV2-infected suckling mice.
The six-day-old ICR suckling mice were divided into three groups. The same treatment as in Figure 6 was conducted. (A) The clinical score in (A)
for 3-MA treatment and in (B) for rapamacin treatment, as well as survival rate in (C) for 3-MA treatment and in (D) for rapamycin were
monitored daily after the treatments. The criteria of the clinical score are described in Figure 1.

indicate that DV may replicate at diverse locations,
including the autophagosome membrane. Therefore,
autophagy may play a role in enhancing viral replication
[43].  In this study, we demonstrated the formation of
autophagosome and amphisome in vivo during DV infec-
tion (Figures 2, 3 and 4). Whether these vesicles are also
involved in DV replication requires further confirmation.
Autophagy is a dynamic, multi-step process that
can be modulated at several steps, both positively
and negatively. An accumulation of autophagosomes
(measured by TEM, as fluorescent GFP-LC3 dots, or
as LC3II lipidation on a Western blot),  could reflect
either increased autophagosome formation due to
increases in autophagic activity, or to reduced turn-
over of autophagosomes. The latter can occur with
the inhibition of their maturation to amphisomes or
autolysosomes, which happens if there are defects in
the fusion with endosomes or lysosomes, respectively,
or following inefficient degradation of the cargo once
fusion has occurred [44]. In our study, we demonstrated
that the fusion of autophagosome and endosome occurred
to form amphisome in vivo during DV infection together
with p62 degradation, indicating that DV2 infection
induces the autophagy flux in vivo (Figures 4 and 5).
This funding is consistent with our previous in vitro
report [25].
It has been widely reported that the infection of
many viruses affects autophagic flux. Coxsackievirus
B3 (CVB3) induces the formation of autophagosomes
without promoting lysosome-mediated protein degrad-
ation [27,45].  In contrast, HIV-1, Influenza A virus,
and HCV infection impair autophagic flux [45].  HCV
does not eliminate long-lived protein through autophagic
degradation [45,46].  We have demonstrated that DV2
infection triggers autophagic flux and DV2-induced
autophagosome is favorable for viral replication in hepa-
toma cells [25]. Panyasrivanit et al. further showed that
DV2 titer is increased by blocking autophagic flux
using fusion blocker L-asparagine, suggesting that the
autophagic flux process decreases DV2 titer [36].
Some viral proteins regulating autophagic activity have
been reported. Overexpression of the hepatitis B virus X
gene (HBx) enhances starvation-induced autophagy through
the upregulation of Beclin 1 expression [47]. Poliovirus 2BC
and 3A proteins regulate LC3 modification and membrane
induction [30,48]. Furthermore, DV2 NS4A protein induces
LC3 cleavage and translocation in epithelial cells [35].
However, whether DV2 NS4A alone in vivo is capable
of inducing autophagy requires further investigation.
We also demonstrated that expression of Beclin 1 was
not changed either in DV-infected or in mock-infected
mice (Additional file 1). This result is consistent with the
finding of our previous in vitro study [25]. Nevertheless,
whether Beclin 1 participates in DV-mediated autophagy 
needs further investigation. We further demonstrated that
manipulation of autophagy affects DV2 infection-related
pathogenesis, including disease symptoms, survival rate,
and virus titer by the autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, which
suppresses the PI3K class III signaling pathway and
autophagic activity, and the autophagy inducer rapamycin,
which blocks the mTOR signaling pathway. Although
encephalitis and neuronal involvement in dengue virus
infection are rare, this suckling mice model provides a
unique system to clarify dengue-mediated autophagy
in vivo. While the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA suppressed
LC3II expression, it could not significantly suppress virus
titer at days 3 and day 5 p.i. in vivo (Figures 5 and 6A). It
is known that 3-MA plays dual roles in autophagy [49].
Under starvation conditions, 3-MA suppresses PI3K class
III and inhibits autophagy; however, under normal condi-
tions, 3-MA promotes autophagic flux. Therefore, the treat-
ment conditions of 3-MA needed to be further optimized
to increase its inhibitory effect on autophagy. In summary,
manipulation of autophagy by 3-MA and rapamycin affects
clinical scores, survival rate, as well as DV2 titer in vivo. A
recent report demonstrated that DV-NS4A expression
induces autophagosome formation during dengue virus
infection, and promotes the infected cells to avoid apoptotic
cell death, which thus contributes to viral replication [35].
Therefore, whether suppression of DV-mediated autophagy
by 3-MA induces infection-mediated apoptosis and further
reduces the replication of dengue virus requires further
confirmation.
Conclusions
We demonstrated herein that DV2 infection can induce
autophagy both in vitro [25] and in vivo.  Furthermore,
manipulation of autophagy by 3-MA or rapamycin affects
the replication of DV2 and symptoms of dengue infection
in vivo.  Our results suggest that the DV2-related
pathogenesis and survival rate of the suckling mice
were enhanced by autophagy, possibly by promoting
viral replication.
Additional files
 Additional file 1: Beclin 1 expression was not changed in the brain
tissue of DV2-infected suckling mice. Six-day-old ICR suckling mice were
intracranially inoculated with DV2 (2.5×105 pfu/mouse) or control media
(Mock). After virus infection, mice were sacrificed and the brain tissues were
harvested at days 3, 5, and 6 p.i. The expression of Beclin 1 was determined
by (A) Western blotting and (B) IHC staining of day 5 brain sections using
anti-Beclin 1 antibidy. β-actin was used as the internal control.
 Additional file 2: Autophagy inhibitor 3-MA and inducer rapamycin
had no effect on the body weight of DV2-infected suckling mice.
Three groups of six-day-old ICR suckling mice were mock-infected or
infected by DV2 (2.5 x 105 pfu/mouse) inoculation. At 24 h p.i., mice were
treated with 3-MA (80μg/g) in (A), rapamycin (0.15μg/g) in (B), or PBS by
intracranial inoculation. The body weight of the mice was determined every
day for 5 to 6 days.
