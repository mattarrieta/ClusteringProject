Abstract
Dengue is one of the most important emerging vector-borne viral diseases. There are four serotypes of dengue
viruses (DENV), each of which is capable of causing self-limited dengue fever (DF) or even life-threatening dengue
hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). The major clinical manifestations of severe DENV
disease are vascular leakage, thrombocytopenia, and hemorrhage, yet the detailed mechanisms are not fully
resolved. Besides the direct effects of the virus, immunopathological aspects are also involved in the development
of dengue symptoms. Although no licensed dengue vaccine is yet available, several vaccine candidates are under
development, including live attenuated virus vaccines, live chimeric virus vaccines, inactivated virus vaccines, and
live recombinant, DNA and subunit vaccines. The live attenuated virus vaccines and live chimeric virus vaccines are
undergoing clinical evaluation. The other vaccine candidates have been evaluated in preclinical animal models or
are being prepared for clinical trials. For the safety and efficacy of dengue vaccines, the immunopathogenic
complications such as antibody-mediated enhancement and autoimmunity of dengue disease need to be
considered.

Review
Introduction
Dengue virus (DENV) is a member of the Flavivirus
genus of the Flaviviriade family which also includes yel-
low fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) and tick-borne encephalitis
virus. There are four antigenically distinct serotypes
(DENV1-4) based on neutralization assay. DENV is
transmitted to humans mainly by Aedes mosquitoes
(Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) [1]. The prevalence
of dengue disease is high especially in the Asia-Pacific
region and the Americas. All four DENV serotypes are
now circulating in these areas. With increased inter-
national travel and climate change, people are at risk of
dengue infection beyond the traditional tropical and
subtropical areas. Dengue disease is becoming one of
the most important emerging vector-borne viral dis-
eases. An estimated 50 million dengue infection cases

gue and 20,000 deaths per year [2].
Characteristics of dengue virus
DENV is a lipid-enveloped positive-strand RNA virus.
The RNA genome of DENV is about 10.7 kb and encodes
three structural proteins, namely capsid protein (C), pre-
cursor membrane/membrane protein (PrM/M), and en-
velope protein (E). Besides the structural proteins, there
are seven nonstructural proteins (NS) which are associ-
ated with viral replication and disease pathogenesis. The
coding of the viral proteins is organized in the genome as
C-prM-E-NS1-NS2A-NS2B-NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5 [3,4].
The C protein stabilizes the viral RNA within the viral
nucleocapsid. The N-terminus of the C protein encodes
a nuclear localization sequence which allows C protein
translocation into the nucleus and interaction with het-
erogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein [5].  A recent re-
port showed that DENV C protein may interact with
human death domain-associated protein Daxx and in-
duce apoptosis [6]. The prM protein acts as a chaperone
that helps the folding of E protein. The M protein is a
proteolytic fragment derived from its precursor form
prM by furin cleavage in the trans-Golgi network. The E

protein is the major protein exposed on the virus surface
and has three distinct structural domains. Domain I of
the E protein is an eight-stranded β barrel and is struc-
turally positioned between domain II and domain III.
Domain II contains a dimerization region and a highly
conserved fusion loop. Domain III consists of an
immunoglobulin-like fold and is the proposed receptor
binding domain [4,7].
The NS1 protein is a glycoprotein and is expressed in
three forms: an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident
form, a membrane-anchored form, and a secreted form.
In DENV-infected mammalian cells, NS1 is synthesized
as a soluble monomer and is dimerized after posttransla-
tional modification in the ER where it plays an essential
role in viral replication (ER-resident form) [8,9].  In
infected mammalian cells, secreted NS1 (sNS1) exists as
hexamers, and is another dominant target of humoral
immunity [10]. Soluble NS1 binds to the plasma mem-
brane of uninfected cells by interactions with heparin
sulfate and chondroitin sulfate E [11]. NS1 is expressed
on the surface of infected cells as membrane-anchored
form, possibly by a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)
anchor [12] or lipid raft association [13]. The functions
of surface expressed NS1 have been reported to include
signal transduction [12] and complement activation [11].
In addition, N-linked glycosylation of NS1 modulates its
secretion, cell-surface expression, hexamer stability, and
interaction with human complement [14].
NS2A can cleave itself from NS1 by its protease activ-
ity and at the same time properly processes NS1 in the
ER [15].  NS2A is also capable of blocking interferon
(IFN)-mediated signal transduction [16].  NS2B is a
cofactor of NS3 which together form an active serine
protease complex [17]. NS3 is a multifunctional protein
with N-terminal protease domain, RNA 5′-triphos-
phatase, RNA helicase and RNA-stimulated NTPase
domain in the C-terminal region. Protease activity is
required to process the polyprotein precursor and is es-
sential for viral replication [18]. The helicase activity of
NS3 is involved in viral replication and viral assembly
[19,20].  Both NS4A and NS4B may be involved in
blocking IFN-α/β-induced signal transduction [16,21].
However, NS4B can modulate viral replication by its
interaction with NS3 [22]. NS5 is the largest and most
conserved DENV protein. It encodes two distinct en-
zyme activities, i.e. S-adenosyl methyltransferase which
can methylate the 5′end of viral RNA [23] and RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase [24].
Dengue disease manifestation and classification
Infection with DENV may cause mild DF with an onset
of fever accompanied by severe headache, retro-orbital
pain, myalgia, arthralgia, abdominal pain, rash, and
minor hemorrhage in the form of petechiae, epistaxis, or 
gingival bleeding. Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia
may occasionally be observed in DF patients [25]. Severe
DHF/DSS generally occurs in those patients who are
secondarily infected with a different DENV serotype.
However, DHF/DSS may still occur in primary infection
[26].  DHF is characterized by all the symptoms of DF
but also shows severe bleeding, thrombocytopenia,
plasma leakage and organ involvement. Traditionally,
there are four grades for classifying DHF. Grades I and
II of DHF represent relatively mild cases without shock,
whereas grades III and IV of DHF are more severe and
might develop to disseminated intravascular coagulation
[27,28].  The WHO recently reclassified dengue due to
difficulties in applying the old classification in the clin-
ical situation [29,30]. The new guidelines focus on levels
of disease severity and cases are classified as dengue
without warning sign, dengue with warning sign, and se-
vere dengue. Patients with severe plasma leakage, severe
bleeding or severe organ involvement are defined as se-
vere dengue. The new classification system emphasizes
the early recognition of potential manifestations. There-
fore, recent reports indicate higher sensitivity using the
revised classification [31].  Early prediction is very im-
portant to avoid unnecessary hospitalization, especially
in hyper-endemic areas. However, whether the new
guidelines reduce the specificity of dengue confirmation
needs to be further evaluated.
Dengue virus pathogenesis
The complicated pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is not fully
resolved. However, several hypotheses for the pathogen-
esis of DENV infection have been proposed, including
viral pathogenesis and immunopathogenesis, which play
significant roles in major manifestations of DHF/DSS,
such as hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, plasma leakage
and organ impairment [32-35].
Viral pathogenesis
Viral pathogenesis indicates the pathology directly
caused by the virus which is subject to serotypic or
genotypic differences. Differences in transmission effi-
ciency and disease expression between the four serotypes
are still uncertain, but DENV-2 and DENV-3 have been
associated with an outbreak of severe dengue [36]. Viral
genetic and structural differences might contribute to
virus variation and influence human disease severity
[37-40]. The affinity of DENV for host receptors might
affect virus infectivity as well as virulence. Recent studies
indicated that certain mutations in the E and NS3 pro-
teins altered the virulence of DENV by enhancing bind-
ing activity to host cells and increasing viral replication
[41].

Immunopathogenesis
The critical phase of dengue disease is not observed at
the peak of viremia but rather when the viral burden has
started to decline. This has led to the suggestion that
immune responses are not only responsible for virus
clearance but also contribute to pathogenesis. The
adaptive immune responses, inflammatory mediators
and autoimmunity are important factors involved in
immunopathogenesis [34,42].
The adaptive immune responses play important roles
in the immunopathogenesis of dengue disease. Anti-
body-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a well-known
phenomenon of dengue pathogenesis. From epidemio-
logical studies, the presence of preexisting heterologous
antibodies (Abs) which fail to neutralize the current
infecting serotype is a major factor for developing DHF/
DSS in both infants and adults [43].  Those sub-
neutralizing Abs enhance viral uptake by Fcγ receptor
(FcγR)-dependent [43] or FcγR-independent mecha-
nisms [44]. Recently, a new hypothesis (termed intrinsic
ADE) postulates that FcγR-mediated DENV internaliza-
tion suppresses innate immunity, increases interleukin-
10 production and biases T-helper-1 (Th1) responses to
Th2 responses, leading to both high levels of viral load
and Abs in dengue patients [45-47]. In addition to neu-
tralizing and infection-enhancing Abs, memory T cells
which cross-react with heterologous viruses could pro-
vide partial protective immunity, as well as cause immu-
nopathology [48].  Secondary dengue infections show
predominant expansion of T cells with low affinity for
the current infecting serotype and high affinity for the
previously infected DENV serotype (known as original
antigenic sin) [49].  Numerous studies showed that the
cross-reactive T cells produce high concentrations of in-
flammatory cytokines which might correlate with plasma
leakage in severe dengue [50-53]. DENV-specific human
CD4+ cytotoxic T cell clones have been demonstrated to
not only produce cytokines but also lyse bystander target
cells in vitro [54].
Several studies have shown that patients with severe
dengue have elevated plasma markers, such as cytokines,
chemokines, soluble receptors, coagulation and endothe-
lial markers [27,55-57].  The abnormal production of
plasma markers mainly comes from monocytes [58], T
cells [50-53], mast cells [59], and neutrophils [60]. High
levels of C3a and C5a have also been measured in den-
gue patients’  plasma [11,61].  In addition, complement
could be activated by soluble NS1 and anti-DENV NS1
Abs on DENV-infected endothelial cells [61,62].
Autoantibodies and molecular mimicry represent an-
other contributory factor in dengue disease pathogen-
esis. Autoantibodies against platelets [63-65], endothelial
cells [66,67] and coagulatory molecules [66,68-70] have
been observed in dengue patient sera and associated 
with severe dengue. Molecular mimicry between plate-
lets, endothelial cells or coagulatory molecules with
NS1, prM and E proteins may explain the cross-
reactivity of anti-NS1, anti-prM or anti-E Abs to host
proteins. The consequences arising from these cross-
reactive Abs include platelet dysfunction, endothelial cell
apoptosis, coagulation defect, and macrophage activation
[42,57,71,72]
Protective immune responses
Both humoral and cellular immunity contribute to
DENV clearance and protection. The E protein is the
major component on the surface of DENV virion and is
a dominant target of Ab responses against DENV. E pro-
tein binds to cellular receptors and mediates fusion be-
tween viral envelope and cellular membrane during viral
entry [55,73-75]. Passive immunization with anti-E Abs
provides protection against DENV infection in mice
[76].  Although the NS1 protein is not a component of
the virion, the NS1 protein is expressed on the surface
of infected cells [12] and is secreted into the circulation
[10]. Abs against NS1 can trigger complement-mediated
lysis of DENV-infected cells in vitro and protect mice
from DENV challenge [77]. In addition, monoclonal Abs
against prM/M have been shown to provide protection
against DENV challenge [78].
Infection with DENV results in the development of
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses against multiple viral
proteins, of which the NS3 protein appears to be
immunodominant [79]. The effector functions of DENV-
specific T cells include cytokine production and target
cell lysis [55].  Both DENV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells protect mice from DENV infection; however CD8+
T cells are more efficient [80-83]. Recent studies further
demonstrated that both cross-reactive B and T cells pro-
vide protection against a secondary heterotypic DENV
infection [84,85].
The challenges of dengue vaccine development
The ideal dengue vaccine should provide long-term
homotypic and heterotypic protection. Therefore, there
are several factors which require consideration. First, the
vaccine must be protective against each of the four
DENV serotypes to reduce the risk of ADE. Second, the
immunization should be safe and not cause unacceptable
side-effects caused by cross-reactive Abs or cross-
reactive T cells. Third, the cost should be affordable to
the individuals who most need the vaccines [86,87].
There are still several obstacles for the development of
dengue vaccines. One is that the complicated pathogen-
esis is not fully understood. Another hindrance is
the lack of suitable animal models. DENV can infect
nonhuman primates but does not replicate well or cause
marked disease. For reasons of cost and convenience,

Page 4 of 9
mouse models have been used to test vaccine candidates
prior to testing in nonhuman primates. In general, im-
munocompetent mice are the more suitable models to
test the immunogenicity of a vaccine. However, DENV
replicates poorly in these mice. Recent progress has been
made in modeling dengue in mice, using transgenic,
knockout and humanized approaches [88]. One recently
described mouse model explored the use of intravenous,
intraperitoneal, intracerebal or intradermal inoculation
of DENV, resulting in liver pathology, neurological
symptoms, thrombocytopenia, or hemorrhage [89,90]. In
addition, the SCID-tumor mouse model has been tested
for live-attenuated dengue vaccine [91] and the im-
munocompromised mouse model AG129 has been de-
veloped for vaccine testing [92].
Current vaccine progress
Although no licensed dengue vaccine is yet available,
several vaccine candidates are under development. These
include live attenuated virus vaccines, live chimeric virus
vaccines, inactivated virus vaccines, and live recombin-
ant, DNA and subunit vaccines [93]. Live viral vaccines
have advanced to clinical trials, but have shown prob-
lems, such as unequal immunogenicity of the four sero-
types and viral interference among the four serotypes in
tetravalent formulations. Non-viral vaccines have also
been proposed and developed for safety reasons. This in-
cludes subunit vaccines that mostly focused on the E
protein or its derivatives. However, the difficulty of
eliciting balanced levels of neutralizing Abs to each of
the four serotypes remains a major concern. NS1 is an-
other subunit vaccine candidate that it is not a virion-
associated protein and it has no ADE effects [30].
Live attenuated virus vaccines
Live attenuated virus vaccines contain weakened viruses
that still can induce adaptive immune responses to both
structural and nonstructural proteins. The replication of
live attenuated viruses should be sufficiently restricted to
avoid pathological effects. One of the most successful
examples of a live attenuated virus vaccine is the 17D
strain of YFV, another member of the flavivirus family
[94]. Unfortunately the search for an equally successful
attenuated dengue vaccine has proven more elusive. In
pre-clinical study, live attenuated viruses derived from
serially passaged DENV in primary dog kidney (PDK)
cells were inoculated in rhesus monkeys to test for
viremia and immune responses [95].  Investigators at
Mahidol University in Bangkok, Thailand and the Walter
Reed Army Research Institute (WRAIR) group in the
USA independently developed attenuated DENV vaccine
candidates by passage in tissue culture cells for each
serotype of DENV [96,97].  Tetravalent dengue vaccine
formulations produced by the Mahidol group were used 
for Phase I and II clinical trials in Thai adults and chil-
dren. Not all of the volunteers seroconverted to all four
DENV serotypes and some showed unacceptable
reactogenicity. Consequently, further clinical testing
was stopped [98-100]. The WRAIR-produced tetravalent
dengue vaccine formulation also showed problems of
unbalanced immunogenicity and reactogenicity [97].
New formulations seem to be safe and immunogenic in
a Phase II study, however, the protective efficacy needs
to be further evaluated [101].
A more modern approach is based on site-directed
mutagenesis of the viral genome to cause attenuation. A
deletion of 30 nucleotides (Δ30) in the 3′-untranslated
region of DENV4 was first demonstrated to attenuate
DENV4, named as DEN4Δ30 [102], and used in Phase I
clinical evaluation [103].  However, while this strategy
resulted in attenuation for DENV1 and DENV4, with
retained immunogenicity, it was less successful for
DENV2 and DENV3 [102,104-106].  Hence, an alterna-
tive chimeric strategy for DENV2 and DENV3 was
designed using the Δ30DEN4 as genetic backbone for
DENV2 and DENV3 (designated as DEN2/4Δ30
and DEN3/4Δ30).  These monovalent DENV vaccines
(DEN1Δ30, DEN2/4Δ30, DEN3/4Δ30 and DEN4Δ30)
have been tested for attenuation and immunogenicity in
animal models and humans, and the attenuated tetrava-
lent DENV vaccine admixtures are currently in Phase I
clinical studies [30,107].
Live chimeric virus vaccines
The most advanced product so far, Sanofi Pasteur’s
ChimeriVax Dengue tetravalent vaccine (CVD1-4) uti-
lized the licensed YFV 17D vaccine as backbone, each
expressing the prM and E genes of one of the four
DENV serotypes. Pre-clinical studies demonstrated that
the tetravalent vaccine is genetically and phenotypically
stable [108,109], less neurovirulent than YFV 17D [110],
and immunogenic in monkeys [111]. In Phase I studies,
the tetravalent CVD vaccine appeared safe with rela-
tively low viremia [112-114]. Recently, however, Phase II
study showed only 30 percent effectiveness and efficacies
against only DENV1, 3 and 4 serotypes [115]. These re-
sults indicate that the Sanofi dengue vaccine still carries
the risk of ADE and needs more testing, modification
and/or clinical trials especially in dengue-endemic coun-
tries [116].
Inactivated virus vaccines
Inactivated virus vaccines have two advantages over live
virus vaccines, i.e. no possibility of reverting to virulence
(safety) and relative ease of inducing balanced immune
responses (for tetravalent vaccines). However, some chal-
lenges remain, such as lack of the immunity to NS
proteins and a requirement of adjuvants for enhancing

immunogenicity. A purified, inactivated DENV2 vaccine
has been shown to be immunogenic and protective in
mice and rhesus monkeys [117] as well as formulated
with adjuvants for inducing higher levels of neutralizing
Abs and protection against viraemia [118].
Live recombinant, DNA and subunit vaccines
Recent advances in molecular biology have spurred den-
gue vaccine efforts using live recombinant, DNA and
subunit vaccines. Generally, the DENV E protein is used
as the major immunogen. Certain live viral vectors, such
as adenovirus, alphavirus and vaccinia virus are designed
for direct administration to the host and have been
engineered to express DENV E protein for further evalu-
ation as vaccines [119-121]. In addition, recombinant E
proteins expressed from yeast and insect cells have been
used to test for immunogenicity [122-124] and protect-
ive efficacy [124,125] in animal models. Truncated E
proteins (DEN-8E) produced for all serotypes have been
developed with aluminum hydroxide (adjuvant) as tetra-
valent vaccine formulations [125].
The domain III of the DENV E protein (EDIII) is the
proposed receptor binding domain and elicits neutraliz-
ing Abs [30]. It has been demonstrated that immuniza-
tion with recombinant EDIII induces protective Abs
against DENV in both mouse [126] and nonhuman pri-
mate models [127]. To develop a tetravalent subunit vac-
cine, Leng et al. have prepared a consensus EDIII
(cEDIII) protein by aligning amino acid sequences from 
different isolates of the four serotypes of DENV. They
showed that the novel cEDIII successfully elicited cross-
neutralizing Ab responses against four serotypes in a
mouse model [128] and neutralizing Ab responses
against DENV-2 in a nonhuman primate model [129].
An engineered heterologous lipoprotein (recombinant
lipo-EDIII) which is EDIII protein fused with lipid signal
peptides was reported to induce higher levels of neutral-
izing Abs than EDIII protein formulated with alum adju-
vant [130].  Combining the tetravalent and adjuvant
effects, a novel single-dose dengue subunit vaccine (lipo-
cEDIII) was demonstrated to neutralize the four sero-
types of DENV and induce memory immune responses
[131].  However, recent studies indicated that EDIII-
specific Abs do not constitute a large percentage in the
dengue patient sera and only contribute to a small pro-
portion of DENV neutralization in vitro [132-134]. Thus,
the main epitope of DENV for neutralizing Abs in the
human as well as the applicability of EDIII-based vac-
cines remain to be defined.
NS1 is not a structural component of the virion, and
therefore, does not contribute to ADE. Anti-DENV NS1
Abs are potentially protective antibodies since they trig-
ger complement-mediated lysis of DENV-infected cells
[77]. Several studies indicated that passive immunization
with anti-NS1 Abs [131], DNA vaccine against NS1 pro-
teins [135-138], or recombinant vaccinia virus expressing
NS1 [139] and active immunization with NS1 proteins
[77,140] could provide protection in mice against DENV

challenge (Table 1).  However, anti-NS1 Abs still have
some pathogenic effects as determined both in vitro and
in vivo due to cross-reactivity with host proteins
[57,71,141].  A safe dengue NS1-based vaccine would
likely require the deletion or modification of cross-
reactive epitopes. In our studies, we have tested the
immunogenicity, pathogenic and protective effects of
full-length DENV NS1 and NS1 lacking the C-terminal
amino acid residues 271-352 (designated ΔC NS1). Re-
sults showed that the immunogenicity of ΔC NS1 was
similar to that of full-length DENV NS1 but, most im-
portantly, ΔC NS1 did not induce pathogenic effects as
assayed by cross-reactivity or bleeding tendency [142].
In addition, passive immunization with anti-ΔC NS1
Abs provides protection against DENV infection in a
hemorrhagic mouse model (unpublished data).  We are
currently evaluating the application of ΔC NS1 protein
for vaccine development.
Another alternative approach is the production of
fusion proteins, such as E-NS1 proteins expressed by E
coli [143] and prM-E-NS1 proteins encoded by DNA
vaccine [144] which provide protection in mice. How-
ever, the cross-protection against other serotypes needs
to be further investigated.
Conclusions
Although no licensed dengue vaccine is yet available, the
ever-increasing knowledge of dengue pathogenesis, is
providing more insights into improved vaccine design.
Important aspects of dengue vaccine development
include common features such as immunogenicity,
reactogenicity and protective efficacy but also dengue-
unique features such as the heterotypic nature of the
virus, the risk of ADE and cross-reactivity with host pro-
teins. Furthermore, all of these aspects should ideally be
tempered with considerations of cost and stability.
