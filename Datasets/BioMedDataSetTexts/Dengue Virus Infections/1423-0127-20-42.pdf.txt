Abstract
Dengue virus (DENV) infection can cause life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock
syndrome (DSS). Vascular leakage and abnormal hemorrhage are the two major pathogenic changes found in these
patients. From previous studies, it is known that both antibodies and cytokines induced in response to DENV
infection are involved in the immunopathogenesis of DHF/DSS. However, the role of viral factors during DENV
infection remains unclear. Nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), which is secreted in the sera of patients, is a useful
diagnostic marker for acute DENV infection. Nevertheless, the roles of NS1 and its antibodies in the pathogenesis of
DHF/DSS are unclear. The focus of this review is to evaluate the possible contributions of NS1 and the antibodies it
induces to vascular leakage and abnormal hemorrhage during DENV infection, which may provide clues to better
understanding the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS.

Introduction
Dengue virus (DENV) belongs to the genus flavivirus
and is a positive-stranded enveloped RNA virus. The
RNA is approximately 10.1 Kb and is translated into
three structural proteins: core protein (C),  membrane-
associated protein (M) produced as a precursor protein
(prM) and envelope protein (E). Additionally, there are 7
nonstructural proteins (NS), including NS1, NS2a, NS2b,
NS3, NS4a, NS4b and NS5. Based on the antigenic differ-
ences of the E protein, DENV can be subgrouped into four
different serotypes: DENV 1, 2, 3, and 4 [1-3].
DENV infection is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. It
is prevalent in tropic and sub-tropic areas where the vec-
tor resides. It has been estimated that greater than 2.5 bil-
lion people live in endemic areas, and the number of
individuals infected by DENV is thought to exceed 50 mil-
lion globally per year [4,5]. Most DENV infections cause

flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache, muscle and
bone pain. This infection is referred to as dengue fever
(DF), and it naturally resolves in several days. However, in
some patients, severe dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue
shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) may occur. This is correlated
with high viremia, secondary dengue virus infection, and
DENV type 2 [6-8]. The characteristic features of DHF/
DSS include vascular (plasma) leakage, thrombocytopenia,
and coagulopathy. Due to a lack of knowledge regarding
the process leading to DHF/DSS, only supportive treat-
ment is currently available [9]. In addition, vector control
is the only method of prevention, as there is no effective
vaccine currently available for DENV [10]. Therefore, fur-
ther study of the host and viral factors of dengue patho-
genesis is crucial for developing effective vaccines and
drugs to prevent the occurrence of DHF/DSS [11,12].
Flavivirus NS1 is a relatively conserved glycoprotein
with a molecular weight of 46–55 kDa, depending on its
glycosylation status, which exists in different forms at
different cellular locations [13].  Immature NS1 exists
as a monomer in the endoplasmic reticulum, and it is
processed into a stable homodimer that can be cova-
lently linked to the surface membrane via a glycosyl-
phosphatidylinositol anchor [14].  Mature DENV NS1

contains 352 amino acid residues with two N-linked
glycosylation sites at residues 130 and 207. There are
12 cysteine residues in DENV NS1 that are absolutely con-
served among all flavivirus NS1 proteins, indicating the im-
portance of disulfide bonds in the structure and function
of NS1 (Figure 1) [15]. Unlike other nonstructural proteins,
DENV NS1 can also be secreted as a soluble hexamer,
which forms a lipoprotein particle with an open-barrel pro-
tein shell and a prominent central channel rich in lipids
[16,17]. NS1 antigen circulates in dengue patients from the
first day after the onset of fever up to day 9, when the clin-
ical phase of the disease is over [18]. The serum levels of
NS1 are estimated to range from 0.01 to 50 μg/ml and
early concentrations of NS1 in blood are positively associ-
ated with disease severity [19]. Therefore, DENV NS1 anti-
gen detection has been successfully used for the early
diagnosis of DENV infection [20,21].
Despite the many gaps in our knowledge of the struc-
ture and function of flavivirus NS1, it is known that
intracellular NS1 co-localizes with dsRNA and other
components of replication complexes and plays an es-
sential cofactor role in virus replication [13,23,24]. Con-
versely, secreted NS1 has been shown to bind a number
of different complement pathway components [25].
Complement activation mediated by DENV NS1, which
leads to local and systemic generation of anaphylatoxins
and the membrane attack complex, may contribute to
the pathogenesis of the vascular leakage that occurs in
DHF/DSS patients [26]. In fact, reduction in the levels of
complement components have been described in DHF/
DSS patients, suggesting that complement activation may 
have a role in the pathogenesis of severe disease [27]. In
addition, both secreted and membrane-associated DENV
NS1 are highly immunogenic, and the antibodies they elicit
can cross-react with human endothelial cells and platelets
[28,29]. Therefore, both NS1 and its antibodies may play
pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS.
Pathogenesis of vascular leakage in DHF/DSS
The most prominent feature of DHF/DSS and the best
indicator of disease severity is plasma leakage [30,31].
Plasma leakage is caused by an increase in the capillary
permeability, and it manifests as any combination of
hemoconcentration, plural effusion, or ascites. It usually
becomes evident on days 3–7 of illness, at which point
dengue fever resolves (defervescence), the viral titer drops,
and anti-DENV antibodies gradually increase. However,
the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of plasma
leakage in DHF/DSS are not fully understood.
It is known that the vascular endothelium plays im-
portant roles in the regulation of tissue fluid homeostasis
and transmigration of leukocytes [34,35].  Endothelial
cells and their associated structures, such as the glycocalyx
and basement membrane, form the primary semiperme-
able barrier, which is tightly regulated in the resting state.
During inflammation, the tight junction between adjacent
endothelial cells and the surface glycocalyx of the endothe-
lium are acutely or permanently modified as a part of the
immune response [36,37].  Thus, vascular permeability is
increased, followed by leukocyte adherence and coagula-
tion activation. Although there are differences in the endo-
thelial cell architecture in capillaries of different organs,

Figure 2 Permeability changes and MIF secretion of human
endothelial HMEC-1 cells induced by DENV rNS1. DENV rNS1
(15 μg/ml),  prepared as previously described [32],  was incubated
with HMEC-1 cells. The secretion of MIF in the medium was

permeability of HMEC-1 cells was determined by a transwell assay
as previously described [33].  Each point represents the mean ± SEM
in duplicate.
the phenotypic changes associated with endothelial hyper-
permeability are similar.
Evidence for endothelial cell activation during DENV
infection has been reported [38,39]. Electron microscopy
studies have shown vacuolation of the cytoplasm of
endothelial cells and gap formations in the endothelial
junctions of skin biopsies of DHF patients. Although
DENV has been shown to infect endothelial cells in vitro
[40], histological studies on viral antigens in tissue speci-
mens suggest that direct infection of endothelial cells by
DENV occurs only occasionally [41,42].  Nevertheless,
many pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor ne-
crosis factor-α (TNF-α), macrophage migration inhibi-
tory factor (MIF),  monocyte chemotactic protein-1
(MCP-1), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and high mobility group
box-1 (HMGB-1) are increased during DENV infection,
which may contribute to vascular hyperpermeability
through the disruption of the tight junction and glycocalyx
degradation [33,43-46].  Because pathogenic changes
of plasma leakage are reversible, it is generally believed
that physical damage is not involved. Instead, soluble
mediators, such as cytokines produced during the acute
phase of infection, likely play an important role in the
pathogenesis of DHF/DSS [47,48]. However, it is diffi-
cult to reconcile the specific vascular leakage in DENV
infection with cytokines or similar bio-active mediators
because they are also generated during other infections
that do not lead to vascular leakage. Therefore, a more
complex interaction between host and virus factors has
yet to be characterized in the pathogenesis of vascular
leakage in DHF/DSS. 
Pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy in
DHF/DSS
In addition to vascular leakage, almost all DHF patients
have abnormal hemostasis, which is evidenced by marked
thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100,000/μl)
[49]. In fact, thrombocytopenia is one of the most consist-
ent clinical features of severe dengue infection [50]. This
occurs as a result of both decrease of platelet production
due to DENV-induced bone marrow suppression and in-
crease of platelet destruction in blood circulation [51,52].
Immune complexes containing dengue antigen have been
reported on platelet surfaces and may be one of the mech-
anisms underlying increased platelet destruction [53,54].
Subsequent studies have shown that autoantibodies that
can cross-react with platelets are induced in DENV
patients and NS1 immunized mice [55,56].  These anti-
platelet antibodies may represent another possible mech-
anism by which platelet consumption is increased during
DENV infection.
In addition to thrombocytopenia, an association be-
tween coagulation and fibrinolysis activation and clinical
outcome is also conceivable [57,58].  Prolonged pro-
thrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin
time (APTT),  reduced fibrinogen level, and increased fi-
brinogen degradation products are more common in DHF
than DF [59,60]. Normally, hemostasis is tightly controlled
to prevent overt bleeding or thrombosis. Thus far, it re-
mains unclear how hemorrhage is induced during DENV
infection. However, autoantibodies and cytokines induced
by DENV infection, hemostatic molecules expressed on
DENV-infected cells, and DENV viral proteins may all con-
tribute to the defect of hemostasis during DENV infection
[61]. The combination of these viral and host factors may
tilt the balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis toward
bleeding in dengue patients.
Possible pathogenic effects of anti-NS1 cross-reactive
antibodies during DENV infection
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
pathogenesis of DHF/DSSincluding antibody-dependent
enhancement (ADE) [52]. The ADE hypothesis was pro-
posed to explain why DHF/DSS occurs more commonly
in secondary-infected patients with a different serotype
of DENV. According to ADE, antibodies against DENV
structural proteins, such as E protein or prM, which are
generated from previous infections, cannot efficiently
neutralize subsequent DENV infections of a different
serotype. Rather, these antibodies could bind to DENV
andenhance its infection to Fcγ receptor-positive cells
such as macrophage [62]. The ADE hypothesis leads us
to realize the potential pathogenic roles of antibody in
dengue pathogenesis and explains why passive and actively
acquired dengue antibodies may result in enhance infec-
tions. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of vascular

Figure 3 Viremia, NS1 antigen and antibody responses during
DENV infection. A schematic demonstration of the relationship
between vascular leakage, thrombocytopenia, the kinetics of DENV
viremia, the detection of secreted NS1, and titers of anti-DENV
antibodies in the sera of dengue patients during febrile, critical, and
recovery phases of the disease.
leakage and hemorrhage in DHF/DSS patients are still un-
clear. Recently, anti-NS1 antibodies that can cross-react
with different coagulation-related molecules and cells, such
as human plasminogen, thrombin, platelets and endothelial
cells, have been reported [63-67]. The titers of these endo-
thelial cells and platelets cross-reactive anti-NS1 antibodies
were higher in the acute phaseof DHF/DSS patientsthan
those in DF patients. In addition, the titers of these auto-
antibodies are decreased in the sera collected in the conva-
lescent phase, even though the total anti-NS1 antibody 
levels continually remain high [55,68].  This may explain
why there is no subsequent autoimmune disease in DHF
patients once they are recovered. These anti-NS1 autoanti-
bodies can lead to thrombocytopenia in vivo [56,69] and
nitric oxide-mediated apoptosis of endothelial cells in vitro
[64]. Because there is sequence homology between DENV
NS1 and proteins on endothelial cells and platelets, it is
possible that these autoantibodies are induced by NS1
through molecular mimicry [70]. Therefore, autoantibodies
induced by NS1 may contribute to thrombocytopenia,
coagulopathy and vascular leakage in DHF/DSS. However,
these symptoms in DHF/DSSpatients usually occur within
the first week of fever onset when antibodies are still
underdeveloped [7,31,71]. Therefore, we think the patho-
genic roles of secreted NS1 cannot be neglected, especially
in the early stage of DENV infection.
Possible pathogenic effects of NS1 during DENV infection
NS1, which is secreted early during DENV infection, can
bind to heparan sulfate on the surface of a wide variety
of cells, including epithelial cells, fibroblasts, hepatocytes
and some endothelial cells [72]. The binding of NS1 to
the surface of endothelial cells can induce complement
activation, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of
vascular leakage that occurs in patients with DHF/DSS
[26]. Secreted NS1 can also be endocytosed by hepato-
cytes, which may enhance DENV infection [73]. Binding
of anti-NS1 antibodies to membrane-anchored NS1 can
also induce signal transduction, leading to protein tyrosine
Figure 4 Potential pathogenic roles of NS1 and its antibodies in DENV infection. During DENV infection, NS1 can exist in monomeric,
dimeric, or hexameric form. In the left panel, (1) NS1 is involved in DENV replication within cells [13,23,24]. The NS1 dimer can be anchored at the
cell membrane, which may be involved in signaling transduction [14]. (2) NS1 can bind to C4 protein and promotes its degradation [74]. (3) NS1
can also bind to prothrombin and inhibit its activation [32]. (4) The binding of NS1 to cells may enhance endocytosis and cytokine production,
which may enhance DENV infection and increase vascular permeability [73]. In the right panel, (5) anti-NS1 antibodies that cross-react with
endothelial cells may induce endothelial damage [64]. (6) Anti-platelet antibodies elicited by NS1 may inhibit platelet aggregation and cause
thrombocytopenia [56]. It is the integrated effects of NS1 and its antibodies, and the immunocomplexes they formed that may contribute to the
development of thrombocytopenia, vascular leakage, and coagulopathy during the critical phase of DHF/DSS.

phosphorylation that might affect DENV replication within
infected cells [14]. Conversely, NS1 interacting with com-
plement protein C4 and C4b-binding protein, which can
promote C4 degradation, may in turn protect DENV from
complement-dependent lysis [74,75].  Therefore, NS1 is
a viral factor that can enhance both DENV replication
and immune evasion.
Recently, we have demonstrated that DENV NS1 can
bind to prothrombin and inhibit its activation, which
may prolong APTT in dengue patients [32].  This may
explain why APTT abnormality occurs within the first
week of fever onset when the antibody response is still
weak. In addition, because the vascular leakage in den-
gue patients is directly correlated with APTT levels, NS1
may also contribute to plasma leakage by mechanisms
that do not involve antibodies. In our preliminary study
using recombinant DENV NS1 (rNS1) to stimulate the
human endothelial cell line HMEC-1, we found that
rNS1 stimulation of HMEC-1 cells increased cell perme-
ability in a time-dependent manner, which was positively
correlated with the secretion of MIF in the culture
medium (Figure 2). Even though further studies using na-
tive forms of NS1 are required to confirm the effect of
NS1 on the permeability of endothelial cells, it is possible
that NS1 may induce cytokine production, such as MIF,
to cause vascular leakage in the early stages of DENV in-
fection. NS1 can be detected early during the disease be-
fore antibodies are induced, and the levels of NS1 rapidly
decrease in the circulation once anti-NS1 antibodies in-
crease [18]. Therefore, peak NS1 is only observed early
during the acute phase of infection. As a consequence,
the high levels of NS1 do not coincide with the onset of
severe disease [19]. In addition, the magnitude of NS1 se-
cretion does not correlate with severe pathology in the
mouse model [76]. Thus, we propose that the pathogenic
effect of DENV infection on vascular permeability may
reach the peak when anti-NS1 antibodies are induced
and NS1 immunocomplexes are formed. Besides to the
pathogenic effects of NS1 and its antibodies which were
mentioned above, complement activation by NS1 immuno-
complexesmay further contribute to the development of
thrombocytopenia and vascular leakage during the critical
phase of DHF/DSS (Figure 3).
Conclusions
Not only is vascular leakage the hallmark of DHF/DSS,
but there is evidence to suggest that damage during
DENV infection may begin at endothelial surfaces. In clin-
ical practice, plasma leakage-induced shock-related patho-
physiological conditions are most often caused by bacterial
infections such as sepsis or septic shock [77]. Regardless of
the different causes, similar pathological changes are found
in these patients. These are characterized by a systemic in-
flammatory response causing vascular hyperpermeability 
and leading to almost uncontrollable edema, coagulation
changes and multi-organ failure. Bacterial cell wall compo-
nents, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS, or endotoxin), can
induce septic shock. However, the viral factors in DHF/
DSS remain unknown. Although it is premature to ex-
trapolate from in vitro findings to human pathogenesis, it
is possible that dengue NS1 may play a role similar to LPS
for endotoxic shock patients to trigger the pathophysio-
logical abnormalities in DHF/DSS [78]. However, it is the
integrated effects of NS1, its antibodies, and the immuno-
complexes they formed that may contribute to severe dis-
ease outcome (Figure 4). Further studies to investigate the
pathogenic roles of NS1 and its antibodies, and of course
the contribution of their interaction, immunocomplexes to
the overall disease process may improve our current un-
derstanding of the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS and uncover
new vaccine strategies and therapeutic approaches.
