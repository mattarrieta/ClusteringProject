Abstract
Virtual reality (VR) technology is rapidly becoming a popular application for physical rehabilitation
and motor control research. But questions remain about whether this technology really extends
our ability to influence the nervous system or whether moving within a virtual environment just
motivates the individual to perform. I served as guest editor of this month's issue of the Journal of
NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation (JNER) for a group of papers on augmented and virtual reality
in rehabilitation. These papers demonstrate a variety of approaches taken for applying VR
technology to physical rehabilitation. The papers by Kenyon et al. and Sparto et al. address critical
questions about how this technology can be applied to physical rehabilitation and research. The
papers by Sveistrup and Viau et al. explore whether action within a virtual environment is
equivalent to motor performance within the physical environment. Finally, papers by Riva et al. and
Weiss et al. discuss the important characteristics of a virtual environment that will be most effective
for obtaining changes in the motor system.
Prevalence of virtual reality technology
Virtual reality (VR) technology has been used for several
decades for a variety of psychosocial interventions. But
since the early 1990's there has been an explosion of lab-
oratories and clinics promoting the use of virtual technol-
ogy for physical rehabilitation [1-4]. Presently, combining
the words virtual reality and rehabilitation brings up 132
articles in PubMed. I served as guest editor of a group of
six papers on augmented and virtual reality in rehabilita-
tion that appear this month on the Journal of NeuroEngi-
neering and Rehabilitation (JNER).  These papers
demonstrate a variety of approaches taken for applying VR
technology to physical rehabilitation. 
VR describes a computer-generated scenario (a virtual
world) with which the user can interact in 3 dimensions
so that the user feels that he or she is part of the scene [6].
Currently, there are 4 forms of virtual environments: head
mounted display, augmented, Fish Tank, and projection-
based [see [5-7] for a review]. A totally immersive VR sys-
tem is the head mounted display (HMD) where the sub-
ject sees only the computer-generated image and the rest
of the physical world is blocked from view. With aug-
mented VR systems both computer generated images and
the physical world are visible to the subject. Hence, the
computer world is overlaid on the physical world. With
"Fish Tank" VR, the stereo images are produced on a mon-
itor in front of the subject [8]. These systems have a lim-
ited field of view (FOV) and space in which one can

interact with the scene. Consequently, the resulting FOV is
smaller than that available with other VR systems but the
accompanying pixel visual angle is also smaller and,
therefore, better. With projection-based VR, the computer
generated imagery is projected on a screen or wall in front
of the user much like that in a theater [9]. Back-projection
is often used instead of front-projection to insure that the
projected scene is not obscured by the subject's body.
These systems usually have a wide field of view and can be
multi-walled and floor systems as with the CAVE™ tech-
nology. Among the papers published this month on
JNER, Sparto et al. present studies using a monocular pro-
jection based virtual environment to determine if patients
with vestibular disorders will tolerate wide FOV environ-
ments. Also, Kenyon et al. explore emerging VR technolo-
gies and the application of a stereo projection based VR
system to research in a posture laboratory. 
Another question that has arisen at meetings and in the
review of the papers for JNER is under what circumstances
a computer generated environment should be considered
virtual reality? Factors that differ among many of the lab-
oratories claiming to use virtual reality and that also
emerge amongst this group of papers include field of view,
the presence of stereo vision, and real-time feedback of
head position so that the scene can be updated to reflect
natural movement of the visual world. There is evidence
demonstrating that a transfer of training from the virtual
to the physical environment is greater if the learner is
immersed in the training environment [13]. Perhaps then
the most important and defining factor for VR is the sense
of presence of the performer in the environment. Thus,
the first paper by Riva et al. that appears on JNER this
month focuses on the meaning of presence and its impor-
tance to the use of VR for rehabilitation.
Why use a virtual world for rehabilitation?
Many people question why we don't just have subjects
perform motor tasks in the real world. The answer to this
question is that VR offers us the opportunity to bring the
complexity of the physical world into the controlled envi-
ronment of the laboratory. VR gives us the potential to
move away from reductionism in science and towards the
measurement of natural movement within natural com-
plex environments. In general, VR allows us to create a
synthetic environment with precise control over a large
number of physical variables that influence behavior
while recording physiological and kinematic responses
[10]. To this topic relate the papers by Sveistrup and Viau
et al. also published on JNER this month. Viau et al. com-
pare the kinematic strategies of reach, grasp, and place
movements performed with physical and virtual objects
by healthy adults and those with hemiparesis. Sveistrup
presents current work on motor rehabilitation using vir-
tual environments and virtual reality and, where possible,
compares outcomes with those achieved in controlled
real-world applications.
There are numerous strengths underlying the use of VR
with rehabilitation [11,12]. Among these are that VR pro-
vides the opportunity for ecological validity, stimulus
control and consistency, real-time performance feedback,
independent practice, stimulus and response modifica-
tions that are contingent on a user's physical abilities, a
safe testing and training environment, the opportunity for
graduated exposure to stimuli, the ability to distract or
augment the performer's attention, and perhaps most
important to therapeutic intervention, motivation for the
performer. In the group of papers that I guest-edited for
JNER, the application of Fish Tank VR as a rehabilitation
tool for patients with spinal cord injury is explored by
Weiss et al.
