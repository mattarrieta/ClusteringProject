NetworkingRehabilitationVirtual RealityField of ViewComplex Behaviors
Abstract
Background: Virtual environments (VE) are a powerful tool for various forms of rehabilitation. Coupling
VE with high-speed networking [Tele-Immersion] that approaches speeds of 100 Gb/sec can greatly
expand its influence in rehabilitation. Accordingly, these new networks will permit various peripherals
attached to computers on this network to be connected and to act as fast as if connected to a local PC.
This innovation may soon allow the development of previously unheard of networked rehabilitation
systems. Rapid advances in this technology need to be coupled with an understanding of how human
behavior is affected when immersed in the VE.
Methods: This paper will discuss various forms of VE that are currently available for rehabilitation. The
characteristic of these new networks and examine how such networks might be used for extending the
rehabilitation clinic to remote areas will be explained. In addition, we will present data from an immersive
dynamic virtual environment united with motion of a posture platform to record biomechanical and
physiological responses to combined visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive inputs. A 6 degree-of-freedom
force plate provides measurements of moments exerted on the base of support. Kinematic data from the
head, trunk, and lower limb was collected using 3-D video motion analysis.
Results: Our data suggest that when there is a confluence of meaningful inputs, neither vision, vestibular,
or proprioceptive inputs are suppressed in healthy adults; the postural response is modulated by all
existing sensory signals in a non-additive fashion. Individual perception of the sensory structure appears to
be a significant component of the response to these protocols and underlies much of the observed
response variability.
Conclusion: The ability to provide new technology for rehabilitation services is emerging as an important
option for clinicians and patients. The use of data mining software would help analyze the incoming data
to provide both the patient and the therapist with evaluation of the current treatment and modifications
needed for future therapies. Quantification of individual perceptual styles in the VE will support
development of individualized treatment programs. The virtual environment can be a valuable tool for
therapeutic interventions that require adaptation to complex, multimodal environments.

Background
Visual imaging is one of the major technological advances
of the last decade. Although its impact in medicine and
research is most strongly observed in the explosion of PET
and fMRI studies in recent years [1], there has been a
steady emergence of studies using virtual imaging to
measure and train human behavior. Virtual environments
(VE) or virtual reality (VR) have taken a foot hold in reha-
bilitation with dramatic results in some cases. Some appli-
cations have the patient wearing VE systems to improve
their ability to locomote [2]. Others bring the VE technol-
ogy to the patient to improve much needed rehabilitation
[3]. With either approach, there are at least two issues that
need to be addressed by the clinical or basic scientist
employing virtual technology to elicit natural human
behaviors. One is the ability of the technology to present
images in real-time. If the virtual stimulus has delays that
exceed those expected by the central nervous system
(CNS), then the stimulus will most likely be ignored or
processed differently than inputs from the physical world.
Once a response is elicited, it must be determined whether
the variability observed across individuals is due to indi-
vidual differences or inconsistencies between expectation
and the presentation of the virtual image.
Components of a virtual environment
Let us first define what we consider a VE and consider the
signals that need to be transmitted for such a system to
operate remotely (TeleImmersion). VE is immersion of a
person in a computer generated environment such that
the person experiences stereovision, correct perspective
for all objects regardless of their motion, and objects in
the environment move in a natural fashion with subject
motion. To achieve theses characteristics, certain technol-
ogy must be utilized. To provide stereovision, slightly dif-
ferent images must be presented to the right and left eyes
with little if any cross talk between the two images. In
some systems this is provided by using field sequential
stereo in combination with liquid crystal shutter glasses
(StereoGraphics, Inc). In this system the right liquid crys-
tal lens is clear while the left is opaque and the perspective
scene generated on the screen is that for the right eye.
Then the left eye lens is clear and the right is opaque and
the left eye's view is displayed. This method of producing
stereo has found its way into projection based systems
[4,5] and desktop systems also known as "fish tank VR"
[6]. In other systems the person wears a head mounted
display (HMD) where the right and left eye each see a ded-
icated display so that the computer generates a left and
right eye perspective image and each image is connected
to the corresponding monitor. Such systems have used
miniature CRTs, Liquid Crystal Displays, and Laser light
directed into the eye to create the image on the retina [7].
In contrast to the above mentioned systems, an auto-ster-
eographic system displays stereo images to the person 
without the aid of any visual apparatus worn by the per-
son [8]. The person merely looks at the screen(s) and sees
stereo images as one might in the natural world. Because
of their ease of use by the subject and their versatility these
new and experimental systems have the potential of
becoming the ultimate VE display when large motions of
the subject are not needed.
Regardless of the system used, to keep all the stereo
objects in the correct perspective and to keep them from
being distorted when the person moves in the environ-
ment, it is necessary to track the movements of the person
so that the computer can calculate a new perspective
image given the reported location of the person's head/
eyes. The tracking systems that are used to do this are var-
ied. The most commonly used of these are the 6-degrees
of freedom (DOF) magnetic tracking systems (Ascension,
Inc and Polhemus, Inc.). With these systems a small sen-
sor cube is placed on the subject and the location of the
sensor within the magnetic field is detected. When the
sensor is place on the head or glasses of the person the ori-
entation of the head and therefore the location of the eyes
can be presumed. Other non-magnetically based systems
use a combination of acoustic location to delineate posi-
tion and acceleration detection to obtain body coordi-
nates in space. The combination results in 6 DOF for the
location information (InterSense, Inc). Other systems use
cameras to track the person and then transform this infor-
mation to the 6-DOF needed to maintain a proper image
in the VE (Motion Analysis, Inc).
So far we have confined our discussion to visual objects
and have not considered the use of haptic or other forms
of information to be integrated into the VE system [9]. To
provide a realistic haptic experience to the subject, objects
must be rendered at 1000 times per second. While a local
haptic system such as that produced by Sensable Inc. and
others can provide such high speed communication,
when such information is floated over the network the
issues of bandwidth and latency of the network are para-
mount to consider. While experimental networks have
significantly increased the bandwidth of the network, our
ability to move information over these networks is cur-
rently fixed by the speed of light. Prediction and other
methods can be employed to help reduce the effective
latency (Handshake Technologies, Inc), but this character-
istic will continue to pose a problem for many conditions
that we would like to use in tele-rehabilitation.
In networked VEs several types of data need to be trans-
mitted between collaborating sites: 1. the main data-set
itself (this often consists of 3D geometry); 2. the changes
to the data-set (these occur when collaborating users
modify the geometry in some way â perhaps by moving
the object or deforming it); 3. the virtual representation of

the remote collaborator (this often is referred to as an ava-
tar); 4. the video and/or audio channel (that facilitates
face-to-face conversation.) Video has limited use in stere-
oscopic projection-based VEs because the large shutter
glasses that the viewer uses to resolve the stereo tends to
hide the viewers face from the camera. Furthermore most
stereoscopic projection systems operate in dimly lit rooms
which are usually too dark for effective use of video.
The common model for data sharing in networked VEs is
to have most of the main data-set replicated across all the
sites and transmit only incremental changes. Furthermore
the main data-set is often cached locally at each of the col-
laborating sites to reduce the need for having to retransmit
the entire data-set each time the application is started.
Classically TCP (Transmission Control Protocol â the pro-
tocol that is widely used on the Internet for reliable data
delivery) has been the default protocol used to distribute
the data-sets. TCP works well in low-bandwidth (below
10 Mb/s) or short distance (local area) networks. However
for high-bandwidth long-distance networks, TCP's con-
servative transmission policy thwarts an application's
attempt to move data expediently, regardless of the
amount of bandwidth available on the network. This
problem is known as the Long Fat Network (LFN) prob-
lem [10]. There are a wide variety of solutions to this [11],
however none of them have been universally adopted.
Changes made to the 3D environment need to be propa-
gated with absolute reliability and with minimal latency
and jitter. Latency is the time it takes for a transmitted
message to reach its destination. Jitter is the variation in
the latency. Fully reliable protocols like TCP have too
much latency and jitter because the protocol requires an
acknowledgment to verify delivery. Park and Kenyon [12]
have shown that jitter is far more offensive than latency.
One can trade off some latency for jitter by creating a
receiving buffer to smooth out the incoming data stream.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) on the other hand trans-
mits data with low latency and jitter, but is unreliable.
Forward Error Correct (FEC) is a protocol that uses UDP
to attempt to correct for transmission errors without
requiring the receiver to acknowledge the sender. FEC
works by transmitting a number of redundant data pack-
ets so that if one is lost at the receiving end, the missing
data can be reconstructed from the redundant packets
[13]. FEC however is not completely reliable. Hence to
achieve complete reliability (at the expense of an infre-
quent increase in jitter) FEC is often augmented with an
acknowledgment mechanism that is only used when it is
unable to reconstruct a missing packet.
The virtual representation of a remote collaborator (ava-
tar) is often captured as the position and orientation of
the 3D tracking devices that are attached to the stereo- 
scopic glasses and/or 3D input device (e.g. a wand). With
simple inverse kinematics one is able to map this position
and orientation information onto a 3D geometric puppet,
creating lifelike movements [14]. The 3D tracking infor-
mation is often transmitted using UDP to minimize
latency and jitter â however since the data is mainly used
to convey a user's gesture, absolute delivery of the data is
not necessary. Furthermore since tracking data is transmit-
ted as an un-ending stream, a lost packet is often followed
soon after (usually within 1/30th of a second) by a more
recent update.
Audio and video data are similar in property to the avatar
data in that they usually comprise an unending stream
that is best transmitted via UDP to minimize latency and
jitter. Often video and audio packets are time stamped so
that they can be synchronized on the receiving end. When
more than two sites are involved in collaboration it is
more economical to send audio/video via multicast. In
multicast the sender sends the data to a specific device or
machine that then copies the data to the various people
that are subscribers to the data. For example, a user send
their data to a multicast address and the routers that
receive the data send copies of the data to remote sites that
are subscribed to the multicast address. One drawback of
multicast is that it is often disabled on routers on the
Internet as one can potentially inundate the entire Inter-
net. An alternative approach is to use dedicated computers
as "repeaters" that intercept packets and transmit copies
only to receivers that are specifically registered with the
repeater. This broadcast method tends to increase the
latency and jitter of packets, especially as the number of
collaborators increases.
Quality of Service (QoS)
QoS refers to a network's ability to provide bandwidth
and/or latency guarantees. QoS is crucial for applications
such as networked VE, especially those involving haptics
or tele-surgery, which are highly intolerant of latency and
jitter. Early attempts to provide QoS (such as Integrated
Services and Differentiated Services) have been good
research prototypes but have completely failed to deploy
across the wider Internet because telecommunications
companies are not motivated to abide by each others QoS
policies. It has been argued that QoS is unnecessary
because in the future all the networks will be over-provi-
sioned so that congestion or data loss that result in latency
and jitter, will never occur. This has been found to be
untrue in practice. Even with the enormous increase in
bandwidth accrued during the dot-com explosion, the
networks are still as unpredictable as they were a decade
ago. Ample evidence is available from the online gaming
community which often remarks about problems with
bandwidth, latency and jitter during game sessions [15].
These games are based on the same principles that govern

the design of networked VEs and therefore serve as a good
metric for the current Internet's ability to support tightly
coupled collaborative work.
Customer Owned Networks
Frustrated by the lack of QoS on the Internet, there is
growing interest in bypassing the traditional routed Inter-
net by using the available dark fiber in the ground. Dark
fiber is optical fiber that has not yet been lit. Currently it
is estimated that only about 5â10% of the available fiber
has been lit, and each fiber has several terabits/s of capac-
ity. The dot-com implosion has made this dark fiber and
wavelengths of light in the fiber, very affordable. The
newly emerging model is to construct a separate cus-
tomer-owned network by purchasing or leasing the fiber
from a telecommunications company, and installing
one's own networking equipment at the endpoints. A
number of federally supported national and international
initiatives have been underway for the last few years to
create customer-controlled networks explicitly for the sci-
entific community. These include the National Lambda
rail [16], StarLight [17], and the Global Lambda Inte-
grated Facility [18]. By creating dedicated fiber networks,
applications will be able to schedule dedicated and secure
light paths with tens of gigabits/s of unshared, uncon-
gested bandwidth between collaborating sites. This is the
best operating environment for tightly coupled net-
worked, haptic VEs.
Connection Characteristics for Rehabilitation
The ability to use virtual technology for rehabilitation is a
function of cost, availability, and the kind of applications
that can best utilize the network and provide rehabilita-
tion services. Thus far, tele-rehabilitation research has
focused on the use of low speed and inexpensive commu-
nication networks. While this work is important, the
potential of new high-speed networks has not gathered as
much attention. Consequently, we have little but imag-
ined scenarios of how such networks might be utilized.
Let us consider the case where a high-speed network con-
nects a rehabilitation center and a remote clinic. The ques-
tion is what kind of services can be provided remotely.
The scenario that we envision is one where patients are
required to appear at a rehabilitation center to receive
therapy. Our scenario could work in several conditions.
For example, a therapist at one location may want an
opinion about the patient from a colleague at another
location or, perhaps, the therapist can only visit the
remote location once per week and with virtual technol-
ogy the daily therapy could still be monitored by the ther-
apist remotely. In our imagined condition we have a
therapist at a rehabilitation center with VE, haptic and
video devices and software to help analyze the incoming
data (i.e., data mining) feeding to a remote clinic with 
identical equipment connected together through a dedi-
cated high speed network. As displayed in Fig. 1, the ther-
apist station has several areas of information that
connects him/her to the patient in the remote clinic. The
VE (in this case Varrier) provides the therapist with a rep-
resentation of the patient and the kind of trajectory that
will be needed for this training session. Notice that the use
of Varrier removes the need for HMD or shutter glasses to
be worn by the patient or therapist. This may seem like a
minor difference, but now the patient and the therapist
can see each other eye to eye. The video connection allows
more communication (non-verbal or bed side manner) to
take place between the two linked users of this system. The
haptic device serves two purposes (1) to feedback the
forces from the patient's limb to the therapist and (2) to
feed the forces that the therapist wishes the patient to
experience. Furthermore, we could provide a task that uses
the affected limb so that learning and coordination is
encouraged. Other possibilities include having the robot
apply forces to the patient appendage so that adaptation
and recovery of function occurs [9]. In our scenario we
could allow the patient to see both the virtual limb and
their own limb if needed by the therapy. As can be seen
from Fig. 1, the bandwidth and latency requirements
change as a function of the kind of information that is
being transmitted.
A system as described above is possible today although
expensive. The network characteristics that would be
needed for each information channel would be as follows.
A high-bandwidth connection would be needed for video
and audio streamed to the plasma displays at each loca-
tion, in addition to the high bandwidth a low latency and
jitter connection would be needed for the Varrier Display
system (VE). For a force feedback haptic device communi-
cating between the patient and the therapist, a low net-
work bandwidth could be used but the latency and jitter
need to be low.
Response behaviors in the virtual environment
After all possible consideration of how to best construct
the virtual system, the next concern is how to associate the
complex stimuli with the behavior of interest. The relative
influence of particular scene characteristics, namely field
of view (FOV), scene resolution, and scene content, are
critical to our understanding of the effects of the VE on our
response behaviors [19] and the effect of these character-
istics on postural stability in an immersive environment
has been examined [20]. Roll oscillations of the visual
scene were presented at a low frequency â 0.05 Hz to 10
healthy adult subjects. The peak angular velocity of the
scene was approximately 70Â°/sec. Three different scenes
(600 dpi fountain scene, 600 dpi simple scene, and 256
dpi fountain scene) were presented at 6 different FOVs (+/
-15Â°, 30Â°, 45Â°, 60Â°, 75Â°, 90Â° from the center of the visual

field) counterbalanced across subjects. Subjects stood on
a force platform, one foot in front of the other, with their
arms crossed behind their backs. Data collected for each
trial included stance break (yes, no), latency to stance
break (10 sec maximum), subjective difficulty rating (dif-
ficulty in maintaining the Romberg stance, 1â10 scale),
and dispersion of center-of-balance. Postural stability was
found to vary as a function of display FOV, resolution,
and scene content. Subjects exhibited more balance dis-
turbance with increasing FOVs, higher resolutions and
more complex scene contents. Thus, altered scene con-
tents, levels of interactivity, and resolution in immersive
environments will interact with the FOV in creating a pos-
tural disturbance.
Expectation of the visual scene characteristics will also
influence responses in a VE. When subjects had some
knowledge of the characteristics of a forthcoming visual
displacement most reduced their postural readjustments, 
even when they did not exert active control over the visual
motion [21]. Thus we can hypothesize that visual stimuli
present an optimal pathway for central control of postural
orientation as there are many cues in the visual flow field
that can identified for anticipatory processing. The impor-
tant parameters of the visual field on posture can be
extracted from several studies. Vestibular deficient indi-
viduals who were able to stabilize sway when fixating on
a stationary light [22] became unstable when an optoki-
netic stimulus was introduced, implying that velocity
information from peripheral vision was a cause of insta-
bility. Focusing upon distant visual objects in the environ-
ment increased postural stability [23,24].  We have
observed in the VE [25,26] that small physical motions
combined with large visual stimuli trigger a perception of
large physical movements as occurs during flight simula-
tions [27] and gaming. We have also observed measurable
increases in the variability of head and trunk coordination
and increased lateral head and trunk motion when

standing quietly and walking within a dynamic visual
environment [28].
The challenge is to determine whether the subject has
become immersed in the environment, i.e., has estab-
lished a sense of presence in the environment (see paper
by Riva in this issue), and then to establish the correlation
between the stimulus and response properties. The expe-
rience within the VE is multimodal, requiring participa-
tion of all sensory pathways as well as anticipatory
processing and higher order decision making. Conse-
quently, it is difficult to attribute resultant behaviors to
any single event in the environment and responses across
participants may be very variable. We have united an
immersive dynamic virtual environment with motion of a
posture platform [25] to record biomechanical and phys-
iological responses to combined visual, vestibular, and
proprioceptive inputs in order to determine the relative
weighting of physical and visual stimuli on the postural
responses.
Methods
In our laboratory, a linear accelerator (sled) that could be
translated in the anterior-posterior direction was control-
led by D/A outputs from an on-line PC. The sled was
placed 40 cm in front of a screen on which a virtual image
was projected via a stereo-capable projector (Electrohome
Marquis 8500) mounted behind the back-projection
screen. The wall in our system consisted of back projec-
tion material measuring 1.2 m Ã 1.6 m. An Electrohome
Marquis 8500 projector throws a full-color stereo work-
station field (1024 Ã 768 stereo) at 200 Hz [maximum]
onto the screen. A dual Pentum IV PC with a nVidia 900
graphics card created the imagery projected onto the wall.
The field sequential stereo images generated by the PC
were separated into right and left eye images using liquid
crystal stereo shutter glasses worn by the subject (Crystal
Eyes, StereoGraphics Inc.). The shutter glasses limited the
subject's horizontal FOV to 100Â° of binocular vision and
55Â° for the vertical direction. The correct perspective and
stereo projections for the scene were computed using val-
ues for the current orientation of the head supplied by a
position sensor (Flock of Birds, Ascension Inc.) attached
to the stereo shutter glasses (head). Consequently, virtual
objects retained their true perspective and position in
space regardless of the subjects' movement. The total dis-
play system latency from the time a subject moved to the
time the new stereo image was displayed in the environ-
ment was 20â35 ms. The stereo update rate of the scene
(how quickly a new image is generated by the graphics
computer in the frame buffer) was 60 stereo frames/sec.
Flock of birds data was sampled at 120 Hz. 
Scene Characteristics
The scene consisted of a room containing round columns
with patterned rugs and painted ceiling (Fig. 2). The col-
umns were 6.1 m apart and rose 6.1 m off the floor to the
ceiling. The rug patterns were texture mapped on the floor
and consisted of 10 different patterns. The interior of the
room measured 30.5 m wide by 6.1 m high by 30.5 m
deep. The subject was placed in the center of the room
between two rows of columns. Since the sled was 64.8 cm
above the laboratory floor the image of the virtual room
was adjusted so that its height matched the sled height
(i.e., the virtual floor and the top of the sled were coinci-
dent). Beyond the virtual room was a landscape consisting
of mountains, meadows, sky and clouds. The floor was
the distance from the subject's eyes to the virtual floor and
the nearest column was 4.6 m away. The resolution of the
image was 7.4 min of arc per pixel when the subject was
40 cm from the screen. The view from the subjects' posi-
tion was that objects in the room were both in front of and
behind the screen. When the scene moved in fore-aft,
objects moved in and out of view depending on their
position in the scene.
Procedures
Subjects gave informed consent according to the guide-
lines of the Institutional Review Board of Northwestern
University Medical School to participate in this study.
Subjects had no history of central or peripheral neurolog-
ical disorders or problems related to movements of the
spinal column (e.g., significant arthritis or musculoskele-
tal abnormalities) and a minimum of 20/40 corrected
vision. All subjects were naive to the VE.
We have tested 7 healthy young adults (aged 25â38 yrs)
standing on the force platform (sled) with their hands
crossed over their chest and their feet together in front of
a screen on which a virtual image was projected. Either the
support surface translated Â± 15.7 cm/sec (Â± 10 cm dis-
placement) in the a-p direction at 0.25 Hz, or the scene
moved Â± 3.8 m/sec (Â± 6.1 m displacement) fore-aft at 0.1
Hz, or both were translated at the same time for 205 sec.
Trials were randomized for order. In all trials, 20 sec of
data was collected before scene or sled motion began (pre-
perturbation period). When only the sled was translated,
the visual scene was visible but stationary, thus providing
appropriate visual feedback equivalent to a stationary
environment.
Data Collection and Analysis
Three-dimensional kinematic data from the head, trunk,
and lower limb were collected at 120 Hz using video
motion analysis (Optotrak, Northern Digital Inc.,
Ontario, Canada). Infrared markers placed near the lower
border of the left eye socket and the external auditory
meatus of the ear (corresponding to the relative axis of

rotation between the head and the upper part of the cervi-
cal spine) were used to define the Frankfort plane and to
calculate head position. Other markers were placed on the
back of the neck at the level of C7, the left greater tro-
chanter, the left lateral femoral condyle, the left lateral
malleolus, and on the translated surface. Markers placed
at C7 and the greater trocanter were used to calculate
trunk position, and shank position was the calculated
from the markers on the lateral femoral condyle and the
lateral malleolus. 
For trials where the sled moved, sled motion was sub-
tracted from the linear motion of each segment prior to
calculating segmental motion. Motion of the three seg-
ments was presented as relative segmental angles where
motion of the trunk was removed from motion of the
head to determine the motion of the head with respect to
the trunk. Motion of the shank was removed from motion
of the trunk to reveal motion of the trunk with respect to
the shank. Motion of the shank was calculated with
respect to the sled.

Results
The response to visual information was strongly potenti-
ated by the presence of physical motion. Either stimulus
alone produced marginal responses in most subjects.
When combined, the response to visual stimulation was
dramatically enhanced (Fig. 3), perhaps because the vis-
ual inputs were incongruent with those of the physical
motion.
Using Principal Component Analysis we have determined
the overall weighting of the input variables. In healthy
young adults, some subjects consistently responded more
robustly when receiving a single input, suggesting a prop-
rioceptive (see S3 in Fig. 4) or visual (S1 in Fig. 4) domi-
nance. With multiple inputs, most subjects produced
fluctuating behaviors so that their response was divided
between both inputs. The relative weighting of each input 
fluctuated across a trial. When the contribution of each
body segment to the overall response strategy was calcu-
lated, movement was observed primarily in the trunk and
shank.
Discussion
Results from experiments in our laboratory using this
sophisticated technology revealed a non-additive effect in
the energy of the response with combined inputs. With
single inputs, some subjects consistently selected a single
segmental strategy. With multiple inputs, most produced
fluctuating behaviors. Thus, individual perception of the
sensory structure was a significant component of the pos-
tural response in the VE. By quantifying the relative sen-
sory weighting of each individual's behavior in the VE, we
should be better able to design individualized treatment
plans to match their particular motor learning style.

technology would allow [5]. For example, at some loca-
tion remote from the clinic a patient enters a VE suitable
for rehabilitation protocols connected to the clinic and a
therapist. While this idea is not new, the kind of therapies
that could be applied under such a condition is limited by
the communication connection and facilities at both ends
of the communication cable.
The ability to provide rehabilitation services to locations
outside the clinic will be an important option for clini-
cians and patients in the near future. Effective therapy may
best be supplied by the use of high technology systems
such as VE and video, coupled to robots, and linked
between locations by high-speed, low-latency, high-band-
width networks. The use of data mining software would
help analyze the incoming data to provide both the
patient and the therapist with evaluation of the current
treatment and modifications needed for future therapies.

Developing treatment interventions in the virtual envi-
ronment should carry over into the physical world so that
functional independence will be increased for many indi-
viduals with physical limitations. In fact, there is evidence
that the knowledge and skills acquired by disabled indi-
viduals in simulated environments can transfer to the real
world [29-31].
The ability for us to use this technology outside the area of
research labs and bring these systems to clinics is just
starting. However, the cost is high and the applications
that can best be applied to rehabilitation are limited. The
cost of such systems might be mitigated if this technology
allowed therapists and patients to interact more fre-
quently and/or resulted in better patient outcomes. Such
issues are under study now at several institutions. This
brings us to the idea of tele-rehabilitation, which would
allow therapy to transcend the physical boundaries of the
clinic and go wherever the communication system and the 
Conclusions
The ability to provide rehabilitation services to locations
outside the clinic is emerging as an important option for
clinicians and patients. Effective therapy may best be sup-
plied by the use of high technology systems such as VE
and video, coupled to robots, and linked between loca-
tions by high-speed, low-latency, high-bandwidth net-
works. The use of data mining software would help
analyze the incoming data to provide both the patient and
the therapist with evaluation of the current treatment and
modifications needed for future therapies. Although
responses in the VE can vary significantly between indi-
viduals, these results can actually be used to benefit
patients through the development of individualized treat-
ments programs that will raise the level of successful reha-
bilitative outcomes. Further funding for research in this
area will be needed to answer the questions that arise
from the use of these technologies.
