Abstract
Video capture virtual reality (VR) uses a video camera and software to track movement in a single
plane without the need to place markers on specific bodily locations. The user's image is thereby
embedded within a simulated environment such that it is possible to interact with animated
graphics in a completely natural manner. Although this technology first became available more than
25 years ago, it is only within the past five years that it has been applied in rehabilitation. The
objective of this article is to describe the way this technology works, to review its assets relative
to other VR platforms, and to provide an overview of some of the major studies that have evaluated
the use of video capture technologies for rehabilitation.
Introduction
Two major goals of rehabilitation are the enhancement of
functional ability and the realization of greater participa-
tion in community life. These goals are achieved by inten-
sive intervention aimed at improving sensory, motor,
cognitive and higher level-cognitive functions on the one
hand, and practice in everyday activities and occupations
to increase participation on the other hand [1,2]. Inter-
vention is based primarily on the performance of rote
exercises and/or of different types of purposeful activities
and occupations [3,4]. The client's cognitive and motor
abilities are assessed throughout the intervention period
so that therapy may be continually adjusted to the client's
needs. For many injuries and disabilities, the rehabilita-
tion process is long and arduous, and clinicians face the
challenge of identifying a variety of appealing, meaning-
ful and motivating intervention tasks that may be adapted
and graded to facilitate this process. Clinicians also
require outcomes that may be measured accurately. Vir- 
tual reality-based therapy, one of the most innovative and
promising recent developments in rehabilitation technol-
ogy, appears to provide an answer to this challenge.
Indeed, it is anticipated that virtual reality (VR) will have
a considerable impact on rehabilitation over the next ten
years [5].
Virtual reality typically refers to the use of interactive sim-
ulations created with computer hardware and software to
present users with opportunities to engage in environ-
ments that appear to be and feel similar to real world
objects and events [6-8]. Users interact with displayed
images, move and manipulate virtual objects, and per-
form other actions in a way that attempts to "immerse"
them within the simulated environment thereby engen-
dering a feeling of presence in the virtual world [9,10].
The objective of this article is to briefly describe the use of
VR in rehabilitation, and then emphasize the unique

attributes of the video capture VR to rehabilitation,
including an overview of some of the major studies that
have evaluated the use of this technology for
rehabilitation.
Virtual reality applied to rehabilitation
Virtual reality has a number of well-known assets, which
make it highly suitable as a rehabilitation intervention
tool [11]. These assets include the opportunity for experi-
ential, active learning and the ability to objectively meas-
ure behavior in challenging but safe and ecologically-valid
environments while maintaining strict experimental con-
trol over stimulus delivery and measurement. VR also pro-
vides the capacity to individualize treatment needs, while
gradually increasing the complexity of tasks and decreas-
ing the support provided by the clinician [5,12].
During the mid to late 1990s, virtual reality technologies
first began to be developed and studied as potential tools
for rehabilitation assessment and treatment intervention
[7]. The list of applications is long and diverse, and only
several examples are provided here. VR has been used as a
medium for the assessment and rehabilitation of cogni-
tive and metacognitive processes, such as visual percep-
tion, attention, memory, sequencing and executive
functioning [13]. Rizzo and colleagues [14,15] developed
a Virtual Classroom for the assessment and training of
attention in children with Attention Deficits Hyperactive
Disorder. Piron, et al. [16] used a virtual environment to
train reaching movements, Broeren, et al. [17] used a hap-
tic device for the assessment and training of motor coor-
dination, and Jack et al. [18] and Merians, et al. [19] have
developed a force feedback glove to improve hand
strength and a joint position glove to improve the range
of motion and speed of hand movement. The studies cited
above share a common goal of using virtual reality to con-
struct a simulated environment that aimed to facilitate the
client's motor, cognitive or metacognitive abilities in
order to improve functional ability. In some cases, the
applications take advantage of the ability to adapt virtual
environment to simulate real life activities such as meal
preparation [20] or crossing a street [21-25]. The ultimate
goal of such applications is to enable clients to become
able to participate in their own real environments in a
more independent manner. Attempting to achieve similar
results via conventional therapy when clinicians and cli-
ents must deal with real world settings (e.g., a visit to a real
supermarket) is fraught with difficulty. In contrast, virtual
environments may be adapted with relative ease to the
needs and characteristics of the clients under care.
Given the variety of VR platforms and the diverse clinical
populations that may benefit from VR-based intervention,
it is helpful to view the VR experience as a multidimen-
sional model that appears to be influenced by many 
parameters. A conceptual model was developed within
the context of terminology established by the Interna-
tional Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health
(ICF) [2] and the rehabilitation process [25,26].  This
model helps to identify the clinical rationale underlying
the use of virtual reality as an intervention tool in rehabil-
itation as well as to design research to investigate its effi-
cacy for achieving improved performance in the real
world. The process of using VR in rehabilitation is mod-
eled via three nested circles, the inner "Interaction Space",
the intermediate "Transfer Phase" and the outer "Real
World".
The "Interaction Space" denotes the interaction that
occurs when the client performs within the virtual envi-
ronment, experiencing functional or game-like tasks of
varying levels of difficulty, i.e., the activity component
according to the ICF terminology. This interaction is influ-
enced by user characteristics, which include personal fac-
tors (e.g. age, gender, cultural background),  body
functions (e.g. cognitive, sensory, motor abilities) and
structures (e.g., the parts of the body activated during the
task). It is also influenced by the characteristics of VR plat-
form and its underlying technology (e.g. point of view,
encumbrance) that presents the virtual environment and
the nature and demands of the task to be performed
within the virtual environment.
It is during the interaction process that sensations and per-
ceptions related to the virtual experience take place; here
the user's sense of presence is established, and the process
of assigning meaning to the virtual experience as well as
the actual performance of virtual tasks or activities occurs.
The sense of presence enables the client to focus on the
virtual task, separating himself temporarily from the real
world environment. This is an important requirement
when motor and, especially, cognitive abilities and skills
are trained or restored. The concept of meaning is also
thought to be an essential factor that enhances task per-
formance and skills in rehabilitation in general [1,3], and
thus also in the VR-based rehabilitation [27]. Environ-
mental factors within the virtual environment may con-
tribute information about issues that facilitate or hinder
the client's performance, and may serve as facilitators of
performance in the virtual environment leading to
improved performance in the real world.
Two outer circles, the "Transfer Phase" and the "Real
World" denote the goal of transferring skills and abilities
acquired within the "Interaction Space" and eliminating
environmental barriers in order to increase participation
in the real world (i.e., participation in the natural environ-
ment according to the ICF terminology). The "Transfer
Phase" may be very rapid and accomplished entirely by
the client or may take time and need considerable

guidance and mediation from the clinician. The entire
process is facilitated by the clinician whose expertise helps
to actualize the potential of VR as a rehabilitation tool.
Virtual reality platforms
Virtual environments are experienced with the aid of spe-
cial hardware and software for input (transfer of informa-
tion from the user to the system) and output (transfer of
information from the system to the user). The selection of
appropriate hardware is important since its characteristics
may greatly influence what is taking place in the Interac-
tion Space, i.e., the way users respond (e.g. sense of pres-
ence, performance) to a virtual environment [28]. The
output to the user generates different levels of immersion,
which may be enhanced by different modalities including
visual, auditory, haptic, vestibular and olfactory stimuli,
although, to date, most VR platforms deliver primarily vis-
ual and auditory feedback. Visual information is com-
monly displayed by head mounted displays (HMD),
projection systems, or flat screen, desktop systems of var-
ying size. Input to a virtual environment enables the user
to navigate and manipulate objects within it. Input may
be achieved via direct methods such as inertial orientation
tracker or by video sensing which tracks user movement.
Input may also be achieved via activation of computer
keyboard keys, a mouse or a joystick or even virtual but-
tons appearing as part of the environment.
In addition to specialized hardware, application software
is also necessary. In recent years, off-the-shelf, ready-for-
clinical-use VR software has become available for pur-
chase. However, more frequently, special software devel-
opment tools are required in order to design and code an
interactive simulated environment that will achieve a
desired rehabilitation goal. In many cases, innovative
intervention ideas may entail customized programming
to construct a virtual environment from scratch, using tra-
ditional programming languages.
Video capture VR
Video capture VR consists of a family of camera-based,
motion capture platforms that differ substantially from
the HMD and desktop platforms in wider use. When using
a video-capture VR platform, users stand or sit in a demar-
cated area viewing a large video screen that displays one of
a series of simulated environments. Users see themselves
on the screen, in the virtual environment, and their own
natural movements entirely direct the progression of the
task, i.e., the user's movement is the input. The result is a
complete engagement of the user in the simulated task. A
single video camera converts the video signal of the user's
movements wherein the participant's image is processed
on the same plane as screen animation, text, graphics, and
sound, which respond in real-time. This process is referred
to as "video gesture", i.e., the initiation of changes in a vir- 
tual reality environment through video contact. The user's
live, on-screen video image responds at exactly the same
time to movements, lending an intensified degree of real-
ism to the virtual reality experience. Video capture pro-
vides both visual and auditory feedback with the visual
cues being most predominant.
Myron Krueger [29] was the first to investigate the poten-
tial of video capture technology in the 1970s with his
innovative Videoplace installation. This was one of the
first platforms that enabled users to interact with graphic
objects via movements of their limbs and body, and was
used to explore a variety of virtual art forms. The quality
of the video image in these applications was relatively
primitive, consisting of silhouetted figures. Nevertheless,
the immediate response of the virtual environment in
real-time to the user's movements presented compelling
evidence of the possibility of using this technique for
interactive simulation.
The next major development occurred with the release of
VividGroup's Mandala Gesture Extreme (GX) platform
 http://www.gesturetekhealth.com in 1996, together with
a suite of interactive, game-type environments. This plat-
form makes use of a chroma key-based setup so that the
existing background is subtracted and replaced by a simu-
lated background. GX VR has enjoyed considerable suc-
cess around the world in numerous entertainment and
educational facilities including science museums and
entertainment parks. During the past five years it has also
begun to be adapted for use in rehabilitation and has gen-
erated great interest in clinical settings (see below). GX VR
currently offers a wide variety of gaming applications
including, Birds & Balls, wherein a user is required to
touch balls of different colors; if the touch is "gentle", the
balls turn into doves whereas an abrupt touch causes
them to burst. In another application, a soccer game, the
user sees himself as the goalkeeper whose task it is to pre-
vent balls from entering the goal area (see Figure 1).
In the late 1990s two other commercial companies devel-
oped video-capture gaming platforms, Reality Fusion's
GameCam and Intel's Me2Cam Virtual Game System
[30]. Both of these platforms aimed for the low-cost, gen-
eral market, relying on inexpensive web camera installa-
tions that did not entail the use of the chroma key
technique. For reasons that are not clear, Reality Fusion
and Intel discontinued their products within the past two
years.
Somewhat later, Sony developed its very popular EyeToy
application designed to be used with the PlayStation II
platform [URL: "http://www.EyeToy.com"] http://www.EyeToy.com. This is an off-the-shelf,
low-cost gaming application, which provides the oppor-
tunity to interact with virtual objects that can be displayed

on a standard TV monitor [31]. As with the VividGroup's
GX platform, the EyeToy displays real-time images of the
user. However, it does not require a chroma key blue/
green backdrop behind the user nor bright ambient light-
ing (see Figure 2). This makes for an easier setup of the
platform in any location but, on the other hand, it means
that the user sees himself manipulating virtual objects
within a video image of his own physical surrounding
rather than within different virtual environments. An
additional difference between the cheaper EyeToy plat-
form and the more expensive GX platform is that the
former is capable of recognizing users or objects only
when they are in motion. A user who remains stationery
does not exist for EyeToy applications. In contrast, the GX
VR is responsive to users whether they are in motion or
not. 
The EyeToy application includes many motivating and
competitive environments which may be played by one
user or more than one user sequentially in a tournament
fashion. With GX VR, two users can compete together
simultaneously (e.g., boxing, spinning plates) as well as
combine their efforts to create different visual effects with-
out a competitive component (e.g., painting a rainbow,
mirror image distortions and popping bubbles).
The potential of these platforms for rehabilitation was
readily apparent despite the fact that they were originally
developed for entertainment and gaming purposes.
Indeed, VividGroups's GX platform was first applied with-
out adaptations within a clinical setting by Cunningham
and Krishack [32] who used it to treat elderly patients who
were unstable and at high risk for falling. Unfortunately,

the inability to grade these platforms to levels suited to
patients with severe cognitive or motor impairments ini-
tially limited the application of these environments in
clinical settings. In order to broaden the potential clinical
applications of the platforms, our research group adapted
the GX VR platform [33,34]. VividGroup developed, and
now also markets, a version of the GX platform, known as
IREX (Interactive Rehabilitation EXercise) platform [URL: "http://www.irexonline.com"] http:/
 /www.irexonline.com which enables therapists to adapt
levels of difficulty and record performance outcomes [35].
Characteristics of the Video-Capture Platforms
Video-capture VR differs from other platforms in a
number of ways that have great relevance for its use as a
tool for rehabilitation evaluation and intervention. Some
of these characteristics appear to be advantageous whereas
others may limit the utility of video-capture VR. 
Point of View
Video-capture VR provides users with a mirror image view
of themselves actively participating within the environ-
ment. This contrasts with other VR platforms such as the
HMD which provides users with a "first person" point of
view, or many desktop platforms in which the user is rep-
resented by an avatar. The use of the user's own image has
been suggested to add to the realism of the environment
and to the sense of presence [10]. It also provides feedback
about a client's body posture and quality of movement,
comparable to the use of video feedback in conventional
rehabilitation during the treatment of certain conditions
such as unilateral spatial neglect [36].
Freedom from encumbrance
The user in video-capture VR does not have to wear or sup-
port extraneous devices such as an HMD, glove or markers
Page 5 of 12

Page 6
Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation 2004, 1:12  http://www.jneuroengrehab.com/content/1/1/12
in order to achieve a substantial intensity of immersion
within the virtual environment. This eliminates a source
of encumbrance that would likely hinder the motor
response of patients with neurological or orthopedic def-
icits. Although the newer HMDs and stereoscopic glasses
are considerably less cumbersome than previous models,
little information is available regarding their use by indi-
viduals undergoing cognitive or motor rehabilitation. 
User position
Video-capture VR may be implemented while users stand,
sit, or even walk on a treadmill. For example, the same
environment may thus be suitable for training standing
balance of a patient who had a stroke, sitting balance of
an individual with an incomplete quadriplegic spinal cord
injury, and balance during treadmill locomotion of an
individual with a paraplegic spinal cord injury.
Interaction and Control
This characteristic relates to how the user controls objects
within the virtual environment. As indicated above, rather
than relying on a pointing device or tracker, interaction
within video-capture based environments is accom-plished in a completely intuitive manner via natural
motion of the head, trunk and limbs. Not only is the con-
trol of movement more natural, but, in the case of the
chroma key GX VR, a "red glove" option (or any object
with a distinct color) may be used to restrict system
response to one or more body parts as deemed suitable for
the attainment of specified therapeutic goals. For exam-
ple, when it is appropriate to have the intervention
directed in a more precise manner, a client may be
required to repel projected balls via a specific body part
(e.g., by the hand when wearing a red glove or by the head
when wearing a red hat). Or, when intervention is more
global, the client will not use the red glove option and
thus be able to respond with any part of the body. The
ability to direct a client's motor response to be either spe-
cific or global makes it possible to train diverse motor
abilities such as the range of motion of different limbs and
whole body balance training.
Feedback
A limitation of currently available video capture platforms
is the reliance on visual and auditory feedback and the
absence of a haptic interface that would provide partici-
pants with real-time indications of contact with the virtual
stimuli. Such feedback could serve as an important addi-
tion when used in therapy since the balls, for example,
could be rendered to appear to have progressively greater
mass, making the task more or less difficult. It would also
add an additional element of realism to the gaming expe-
rience, and ensure that feedback to participants was more
realistic. This could be accomplished to some degree via a
quasi-haptic effect that might use vibration to simulate a
true haptic interface (A.A. Rizzo, personal communica-
tion). For example, small buzzers may be affixed to the
tips of the digits. Touching a virtual ball in the Vivid GX
Birds & Balls application would generate a low amplitude,
high frequency "buzz". In contrast, repelling a larger ball
in the Soccer application would generate a high ampli-
tude, low frequency "buzz". 
Multiple users
Moreover, one or more users may participate within the
same environment. In some applications, the ability to
have two "rival" users interact simultaneously within the
same game or task adds an element of competitiveness
that may be motivating. Of greater importance is the abil-
ity of the therapist to support a client or use handling tech-
niques in order to facilitate active movement while the
client interacts with the virtual stimuli. The therapist can
be concealed behind the client in order not to be seen in
the VE, or can join the client within the virtual
environment.
Two-dimensional motion plane
Another limitation of the currently available video cap-
ture VR platforms is that they may be operated with only
one camera. This means that all tasks must be performed
within a single plane. In the case of the typical coronal
plane setup where the camera is positioned to face the
user, any functional movement that takes place in the sag-
ittal or transverse planes is disregarded. Virtual scenarios
must therefore be carefully designed such that a meaning-
ful task can be performed despite the restriction to unipla-
nar movement. Moreover, care must be taken when
analyzing the kinematic trajectories since any out-of-
plane motion will not be recorded. It is encouraging to
note that three dimensional, functional environments
will likely soon become available (I. Cohen and A.A.
Rizzo, personal communication).
Applications of video-capture VR in
rehabilitation
Although video-capture platforms have only begun to be
used for rehabilitation applications within the last five
years, there are already results from a number of research
groups who have studied its utility with different patient
populations. In this section we highlight the major studies
that provide evidence that this technology appears to be
suitable for use in rehabilitation. The evidence concerning
participant sense of presence, enjoyment, usability and
performance are summarized as reported by studies of
single platforms and by studies that compared different
VR platforms

Side effects
None of the studies carried out to date have reported any
significant occurrence of cybersickness-type side effects
when using video-capture VR. Rand et al. [28] explicitly
examined the incidence of side effect of a group of 89
healthy participants who experienced the GX platform.
The occurrence of the side effects was very low, and no
participants requested to terminate their participation in
the study. To date, evidence from a fewer number of
patient subjects with spinal cord injury (SCI) or stroke
indicates that they also are not disturbed by side effects
when using video-capture VR [25,34].
Presence and enjoyment
Several studies examined the influence of video capture
platform of the user's sense of presence and level of enjoy-
ment. Rand et al. [28] in their study of 40 healthy young
adult participants, compared two different VR platforms,
the GX-monitor and a combination of GX environments
viewed via an HMD. They found that the participants'
sense of presence was significantly higher when using the
GX monitor platform than when using the GX-HMD. In a
companion study, which compared the GX-monitor with
an HMD with two age groups, 33 young adults and 16 eld-
erly participants, the older group felt a significantly higher
sense of presence and enjoyment than did the younger
group using the HMD. Lott et al. [37] used the IREX video
capture platform and an HMD and found that the levels
of presence reported by the young adult participants did
not differ significantly for the two virtual reality
conditions.
The results of these studies showed that a high sense of
presence and level of enjoyment can be achieved in a
video capture VR platform. They also demonstrate that
user characteristics such as age influence the sense of
presence.
In another study, Rand et al. [38] compared the sense of
presence, performance and perceived exertion experi-
enced by 30 healthy young participants when they
engaged in two games performed within video-projected
virtual environments that differed in their level of struc-
ture and spontaneity. The non-structured application was
applied using VividGroup's Gesture Xtreme (GX) VR plat-
form, and the structured application was applied using
the IREX platform, a rehabilitation-oriented application
of GX, developed to train a specific movement (e.g.,
shoulder abduction) in order to increase range of motion
or endurance. No main effect or interaction effect was
found for the sense of presence (assessed using Witmer &
Singer's [39] Presence Questionnaire (PQ) although sig-
nificant differences were found for several of the PQ sub-
scales. It was concluded that it is possible to provide users
with a satisfactory level of presence and enjoyment using 
both structured and non-structured paradigms. Therefore,
both movement options, structured and non-structured,
enhance the therapist's repertoire of VR intervention tools
in order to maximize rehabilitation.
Rand at al. [40] reported the results of another study, in
which two different video-capture platforms, GX and Eye-
Toy, were compared to determine their effect on users'
sense of presence, level of enjoyment, perceived exertion
and side effects. In this study, 18 healthy young adults
experienced two games in each platform (Birds & Balls
and Soccer in GX and Kung-Foo and Wishy-Washy in Eye-
Toy) in a counter-balanced order. There was no significant
difference in the sense of presence between the two plat-
forms. However, the EyeToy Kung-Foo game, which
encourages participants to eliminate successive invading
warriors by hitting at them, was found to be significantly
more enjoyable than the other games. In a continuation
of this study, Rand et al. [40] examined the feasibility of
using the EyeToy with healthy elderly users. Ten healthy
elderly participants, aged 59 to 80 years, found this plat-
form easy to operate and enjoyable. The results for
patients with stroke at a chronic stage (1–5 years post
stroke) were similar to the healthy elderly. They thought
that it could contribute to their rehabilitation process, and
were able to operate the platform independently. The
responses of a third group of users, patients with stroke at
an acute stage (1–3 months post stroke), were somewhat
different. They also reported that they enjoyed the experi-
ence; however, they became frustrated while performing
the EyeToy games, even when played at the easiest levels.
This latter observation highlights a major limitation of the
closed architecture of the EyeToy; to date, Sony has been
unwilling to adapt the games to include a greater range of
levels of difficulty, nor to provide tools to external pro-
grammers to do so (R. Marks, personal communication).
It also emphasized the effect that user characteristics, in
this case, time post onset of stroke, have on the sense of
presence.
The GX VR platform has consistently generated high levels
of presence and enjoyment across a wide range of clinical
populations and ages including adults with paraplegic
spinal cord injury [34], stroke [25,33], and young adults
with cerebral palsy and intellectual impairment [41]. A
pilot study using the GX platform to determine its suita-
bility for leisure time activities among older stroke survi-
vors was carried out. These participants enjoyed the
experience, and perceived it to be therapeutic [42].
Performance outcomes and sensitivity of video capture VR
The measures of performance used by video-capture VR
studies to date include response times to presented virtual
stimuli, percent success with which a given game is per-
formed (e.g., how many balls are repelled by the user in

the role of soccer game goal keeper), a subjective report on
how much effort the user has felt while in the environ-
ment. The chroma key video capture platforms such as GX
and IREX also provide a relatively gross measure of limb
kinematics. Whether these data have sufficient precision
and resolution to warrant their inclusion in a research
study remains to be investigated (F. MacDougal, personal
communication).
Sveistrup, McComas and colleagues have used the IREX
platform for balance retraining. Following six weeks of
training at an intensity of three sessions per week,
improvement was found for all 14 participants in both the
VR and control groups [35].  However, the VR group
reported more confidence in their ability to "not fall" and
to "not shuffle while walking". The same research group
has also demonstrated that an exercise program delivered
via video capture VR can improve balance and mobility in
adults with traumatic brain injury [43] and the elderly
[44].
Kizony et al. [34] performed a feasibility study of the GX-
VR platform to train balance of people who had a paraple-
gic SCI. The study included 13 adult participants who had
paraplegia. Results from the patient group were compared
to data from a parallel study of a group of 12 healthy adult
participants who performed a similar protocol, while sit-
ting on a chair with hands supported. The results showed
that the participants with SCI who had better balance
function performed higher within the virtual environ-
ments and the healthy participants performed signifi-
cantly better than the participants with paraplegia. This
platform appeared to be suitable for use with people who
have paraplegia and it was able to differentiate between
participants with different levels of balance function.
In a second study Kizony et al. [25] examined the relation-
ships between cognitive and motor ability and perform-
ance within the GX-virtual environments with people
who have had a stroke. Thirteen older adult patients with
stroke participated in the full study. Significant moderate
positive correlations were found between VR performance
and cognitive abilities suggesting that higher cognitive
abilities relate to higher performance within the VR. In
contrast, almost no positive correlations were found with
the motor abilities. Indeed, as pointed out by these
authors, perhaps motor performance demands and their
characteristics should not be expected to be identical
within the real and the virtual worlds. It may be that dif-
ferences in presence, motivation, or other factors influ-
ence the movement patterns differently in virtual versus
natural environments. This result is in accordance with
Lott et al.'s [38] findings which showed significant differ-
ences between functional lateral reach performed in a real
versus virtual environment. They reported that the partic- 
ipants reached significantly further when virtual objects
were presented within the virtual environment using a
video capture VR platform than when they were asked to
touch a person hand standing on their side. They suggest
that embedding the reaching task in a game shifts the per-
son's attention from the possibility of losing his balance
thereby enabling him to achieve greater function.
Rand et al. [28] used a virtual office environment which
was developed by Rizzo et al., [15] and was displayed
both via an HMD and via the GX-monitor platform. In
this case, participants stood in front of the GX monitor
and visually scanned the Virtual Office. Performance by
both age groups was significantly higher when using the
GX-monitor platform than when using an HMD, whereas
the younger group's visual scan ability was better than the
elderly on both platforms. The results also demonstrated
the effect that different user characteristics, such as age
and gender, have on the VR experience and thus should be
taken into consideration when considering which VR plat-
form to use in rehabilitation.
Weiss at al. [41], in a study of five young male adults with
physical and intellectual disabilities, explored ways in
which virtual reality could provide positive and enjoyable
leisure experiences during physical interactions with dif-
ferent game-like virtual environments and potentially
lead to increased self-esteem and a sense of self-empower-
ment. The results of this study showed that the GX-VR
platform was feasible for use with this population. The
participants were able to use the platform and expressed
their considerable enjoyment from the virtual games.
However, the authors raised several concerns, especially
that some of the participants displayed involuntary move-
ment synergies, increased reflexes and maladaptive pos-
tures due to the too difficult levels of the games that were
used in study. Thus, a more controlled study with the
same population is currently in progress in order to exam-
ine more thoroughly the potential of the platform as a
mean for providing leisure opportunities to this
population.
Performance within two games (Kung-Foo and Wishy-
Washy) was measured while three different groups, young
adult participants, healthy senior participants and indi-
viduals who were several years post-stroke, used several of
the EyeToy games [40]. Performance was scored for each
game in terms of how much of a given activity (e.g., how
many windows washed, how many warriers eliminated)
was accomplished within a preset time limit. Higher
scores were achieved when clients were able to perform
these activities faster and/or more accurately. There were
significant differences in performance between the young
and stroke groups, with the young adults having greater

success in both games than the stroke group. The older
adult group performed as well as the younger group.
The performance results described above highlight the
interplay between the user and VR platform characteris-
tics, and emphasize the importance of taking these char-
acteristics into consideration while using VR in
rehabilitation. Moreover, they demonstrate the sensitivity
of the VR performance measures in their capacity to differ-
entiate between levels of participant ability.
Due to the motivating nature of the game-like environ-
ments, it is important to determine how much effort
healthy subjects and those with disabilities expend while
engaged in these tasks. In a study of healthy young adults,
the participants using the GX platform perceived the high-
est level of exertion while playing Soccer, less for Birds &
Balls and still less for a third game, Snowboard where only
weight transfer was needed [28].  When differences
between the age groups were assessed, the younger group
perceived higher levels of exertion in comparison to the
older group. There were also differences in the perceived
level of exertion of the Birds & Balls game in GX as com-
pared to comparable games in the EyeToy [40]. Overall,
the level of perceived exertion was rated as "somewhat dif-
ficult" which is an ideal level to use in therapy.
Initial comparisons of VR-based intervention to
conventional therapy
Using the IREX platform, Sveistrup et al. [35] performed
two studies designed to compare VR-delivered therapy to
conventional therapy. In their first study, patients suffer-
ing from frozen shoulder received exercise either via IREX
applications or via conventional physiotherapy. In both
cases, therapy was directed at improving the quality of
three specific shoulder joint movements. In the second
study, individuals who suffered from post-traumatic brain
injury were assigned to either VR-based (applications such
as the virtual soccer game were used where patients were
encouraged to reach towards the virtual stimulus in
addition to weight transfer) or conventional therapy (e.g.,
stepping, picking up objects, reaching) for balance train-
ing for a total of 24 sessions. In their report on prelimi-
nary data from 14 patients, the authors concluded that
both exercise programs resulted in improvement of
patients' balance. However, additional benefits were iden-
tified for the VR group, including greater enthusiasm for
the VR-delivered therapy program, increased enjoyment
while doing the exercises, improved confidence while
walking and fewer incidents of falling.
Cunningham & Krishack [32] presented VR as it was used
in occupational therapy to improve balance and dynamic
standing tolerance with geriatric patients. They reported
greater improvement in dynamic standing tolerance in a 
small group of older adults following a VR therapy than in
a small group following a standard occupational therapy.
More recently, Bisson, et al. [44] demonstrated significant
improvements in balance and functional mobility in
community-living older adults following a VR exercise
program delivered with the IREX platform. The compari-
son group completed a biofeedback exercise program and
also demonstrated significant balance improvement.
Analysis of conventional and video capture VR treatment
for SCI by specialists in rehabilitation highlighted several
key differences between the two methods of intervention
[34]. First, control over delivery of the stimuli via the VR
platform enabled the therapist to intervene more effec-
tively, especially in terms of physical guidance and sup-
port. In addition, the VR platform allowed precise control
over delivery of the number of stimuli simultaneously
presented to the patient as well as their speed and direc-
tion. These features appeared to increase the number of
times a desired balance-recovery movement was per-
formed by patients. Finally, the ease with which this plat-
form elicited dynamic equilibrium recovery responses, an
essential component in balance training and encouraged
weight transfer movements was remarkable. In contrast,
the static presentation of stimuli during conventional
therapy restricts intervention to focus almost exclusively
on weight transfer.
Towards functional video-capture environments
One of the newest developments in video-capture VR is
the simulation of more functional environments. Rand et
al. [45] have created a Virtual Mall (VMall), using the GX
platform. It has been designed to support intervention of
patients following a stroke who have motor and/or execu-
tive functions deficits that restrict their everyday activities.
This environment enables participants to engage in tasks
based on typical daily activities such as shopping in a
supermarket. In the initial application, shown in Figure 3,
the user moves from aisle to aisle by activating icons
located on a large monitor around thereby encouraging
active movement, transfer of weight from side to side, and
balance reactions. Virtual food items are manipulated
(e.g., selected from a shelf and placed in a supermarket
cart in accordance with a shopping list selected in
advance. The performance of the task provides multiple
opportunities to make decisions, plan strategies and mul-
titask, all in a relatively intuitive manner. Output meas-
ures include a record how well the user accomplishes the
task (e.g.,  how many correct items selected) will be
recorded and saved thus giving an option to monitor
improvement over time. Initial performance measures
and user feedback has been recorded from six patients
who had a stroke more than two years since onset and suf-
fer from residual motor and cognitive deficits. The results
suggest that the VMall provides a motivating task that

requires active movement as well as the ability to plan and
problem solve.
Sony's EyeToy Wishy Washy application involves the
cleaning of successive dirty windows via wiping move-
ments of the hand and arms. Most recently, VividGroup
has developed a laundry application (V.J. Vincent, per-
sonal communication). These moves towards more func-
tional applications are encouraging.
Conclusions
Evidence from the literature has demonstrated the feasi-
bility, usability and flexibility of video-capture VR, and
there is little doubt that this technology provides a useful
tool for rehabilitation intervention. The results of
presence questionnaires, reports of user satisfaction, and
the sensitivity to differences in user ability as functions of
age, gender and disability are all strong indicators of the
suitability of this tool. A short video-clip, taken from a
local news report of applications of video-capture VR for
stroke, illustrates the extremely positive response of one
user to the use of this technology (see Video 1).
To date, as indicated by the studies reviewed above, video
capture VR shows great promise for a variety of therapeu-
tic goals including intervention for cognitive and motor
rehabilitation, functional activities and leisure opportuni-
ties. The general assets of virtual reality summarized above
combined with several assets that are unique to video-cap-
ture VR, are compelling arguments for the inclusion of
this technology in the repertoire of tools available in clin-
ical settings.
Market demand, user interest and improvements in tech-
nology have led to the availability of a number of different
video-capture platforms. There is no doubt that these plat-
forms are valuable as intervention tools during the reha- 
bilitation of patients with neurological and
musculoskeletal disorders. Motivated patients would be
encouraged to practice movements in a repetitive manner
thereby improving their condition, an achievement that is
not easy to attain via conventional therapy [46]. Cur-
rently, the two main contenders for the rehabilitation
market are VividGroup's GX and IREX platforms and
Sony's PlayStation II's EyeToy. Both use large monitors to
display real-time images of users interacting with virtual
objects in a simulated environment. The VividGroup plat-
forms are considerably more expensive and require a
more elaborate setup including a chroma key blue/green
backdrop behind the user and bright, ambient lighting.
Sony's EyeToy is an off-the-shelf, low-cost gaming appli-
cation that may be run under almost any ambient
conditions.
Studies comparing these two platforms have shown that
presence, enjoyment, usability and performance were
equivalent under many conditions and for diverse users.
Thus, despite the EyeToy's limitations, its low cost, user-
friendly interface and simple setup requirements makes it
highly attractive to therapists. It may be readily acquired
for use in any clinical setting, and even be purchased for
use at home to provide regular, intensive therapy after dis-
charge from hospital.
Nevertheless, it is clear that the EyeToy is not suited for
use with the most severely impaired users. The currently
available games seem to have a broad appeal for users of
different ages but an open architecture that permits adap-
tations of existing applications and development of new
environments appears to be a basic requirement to make
this platform truly functional as a clinical tool. A system
for generating an outcomes report comparable to the IREX
platform would also be of great benefit for clinicians.
Additional low-cost video-capture platforms are currently

under development (M. Shahar, personal communica-
tion). Moreover, video-capture platforms that will provide
three dimensional, functional environments will likely
soon become available (Cohen and Rizzo, personal
communication).
In contrast to the EyeToy's closed architecture, Viv-
idGroup's IREX platform provides a user-friendly interface
that a therapist may use to specify a much greater range of
levels of difficulty. Their SDK (Software Development Kit)
provides programmers with the ability to further adapt
existing applications such as the standard set of games
[33] and to design and implement novel applications
such as the virtual mall described above [45]. The popular
press has been generating a considerable amount of pub-
licity in the EyeToy platform [31], and it is clear that low-
cost video-capture systems such as these are poised to
make VR available to a wide range of users. We anticipate
that future developments in technology, such as low-cost
virtual environments that are more functional will enable
clinicians to take advantage of the considerable benefits
that VR has for rehabilitation.
