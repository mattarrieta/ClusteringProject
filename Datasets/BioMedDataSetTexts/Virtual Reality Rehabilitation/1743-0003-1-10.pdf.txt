Abstract
Virtual Reality (VR) provides a unique medium suited to the achievement of several requirements
for effective rehabilitation intervention. Specifically, therapy can be provided within a functional,
purposeful and motivating context. Many VR applications present opportunities for individuals to
participate in experiences, which are engaging and rewarding. In addition to the value of the
rehabilitation experience for the user, both therapists and users benefit from the ability to readily
grade and document the therapeutic intervention using various systems. In VR, advanced
technologies are used to produce simulated, interactive and multi-dimensional environments.
Visual interfaces including desktop monitors and head-mounted displays (HMDs), haptic interfaces,
and real-time motion tracking devices are used to create environments allowing users to interact
with images and virtual objects in real-time through multiple sensory modalities. Opportunities for
object manipulation and body movement through virtual space provide frameworks that, in varying
degrees, are perceived as comparable to similar opportunities in the real world. This paper reviews
current work on motor rehabilitation using virtual environments and virtual reality and where
possible, compares outcomes with those achieved in real-world applications.
Introduction
One of the major goals of rehabilitation is to make quan-
titative and qualitative improvements in daily activities in
order to improve the quality of independent living. Three
determinants of motor recovery are early intervention,
task-oriented training, and repetition intensity [1] while a
major objective of rehabilitation is to identify the means
to provide repeated opportunities for tasks that involve
multimodal processes (different sensory modalities
including vision, haptics, proprioception, audition) and
that further enable increases in function. Carr and Shep-
herd [2] focus on motor relearning where relearned move-
ments are structured to be task specific. They suggest that
the practice of specific motor skills leads to the ability to
perform the task and that motor tasks should be practiced
in the appropriate environments where sensory inputs 
modulate their performance. The functional relevance of
the specific environmental context has been specifically
addressed by Keshner and colleagues [3-5] as it relates to
posture control. These authors have shown that specific
postural responses differ between paradigms where iso-
lated individual control pathways are manipulated (i.e.,
visual, vestibular, somatosensory pathway) as opposed to
within a functionally relevant context where information
from multiple pathways is available.
The successful integration of virtual reality into multiple
aspects of medicine, psychology, and rehabilitation has
demonstrated the potential for the technology to present
opportunities to engage in behaviors in challenging but
safe, ecologically valid environments while maintaining
experimental control over stimulus delivery and measure-

ment [for review see [6,7]]. Moreover, in VR, the user
(patient, therapist) interacts with a multidimensional,
multisensory computer generated environment, a virtual
environment, which can be explored in real time [8]. Vir-
tual reality also offers the capacity to individualize treat-
ment needs while providing increased standardization of
assessment and training protocols. In fact, preliminary
evidence [9-11] indicates that VR provides a unique
medium where therapy can be provided within a func-
tional, purposeful and motivating context and can be
readily graded and documented.
Several features distinguish virtual environments from
other forms of visual imaging such as video and televi-
sion. A key feature of all VR applications is interaction.
Virtual environments (VE) are created that allow the user
to interact with not only the VE but also with virtual
objects within the environment. In some systems, the
interaction may be achieved via a pointer operated by a
mouse or joystick button. In other systems, a representa-
tion of the user's hand (or other body part) may be gener-
ated within the environment where movement of the
virtual hand is "slaved" to the user's hand allowing a more
natural interaction with objects. Finally, while many
applications of VR allow the user to control the viewpoint
on the screen, third-person views or images of the users
themselves that appear as players in the environment also
provide the opportunity for interaction with the VE.
A broad range of visual interfaces are used to create vary-
ing degrees of immersion in a VE ranging from conven-
tional desktop monitors to head mounted displays.
Increasingly complex, fully immersive VR systems, such as
the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) devel-
oped at the University of Illinois at Chicago, provide the
illusion of immersion by projecting stereo images on the
walls and floor of a room-sized cube. Several persons
wearing lightweight stereo glasses can enter and walk
freely inside the CAVE. A head tracking system continu-
ously adjusts the stereo projection to the current position
of the leading viewer. In order to integrate the movement
of the user with that of the VE and virtual objects, user
position and motion must be tracked so that virtual
images can be updated in real-time. Motion tracking
approaches include color subtraction technology, video
frame subtraction as well as magnetic and infrared track-
ing devices. Technical advances in the development of
these interfaces have minimized the once lengthy lag
times responsible for some of the earlier reports of cyber-
sickness.
To date, rehabilitation applications have primarily used
visual and auditory sensory input while the addition of
haptics is less developed. Haptic interface devices includ-
ing gloves, pens, joysticks and exoskeletons provide users 
with a sense of touch and allow the user to feel a variety of
textures as well as changes in texture. There is increasing
evidence that haptic information is an effective addition
towards the accomplishment of certain treatment objec-
tives such as increasing joint range of motion and force
[12]. Haptic information has also been identified as a sig-
nificant signal for improving a subject's performance in
more difficult tasks. For example, Shing and colleagues
[13] report a specific benefit of adding haptic information
to an upper extremity movement when the difficulty of
the task, in this case a 3D pick and place task, was high.
Integration of visual and haptic interfaces with motion
tracking allows the user to become immersed in three
dimensional virtual environments, including three
dimensional sound, and virtual objects that can be picked
up, manipulated, and even felt with the fingers and hands
[14].
Another cardinal feature of virtual reality is the provision
of a sense of actual presence in, and control over, the sim-
ulated environment [15]. The sense of presence has been
defined as the feeling of being in an environment even if
one is not physically present and resulting in behavior
that is congruent with the subject's situation in the envi-
ronment [16]. Early studies relied on questionnaires to
characterize presence within a virtual environment [15]
with more recent work suggesting that physiological
measures including heart rate and galvanic skin response
provide important information about user immersion
[17].
Movement elicited and generated in virtual reality
applications
One important consideration with the application of vir-
tual reality and movement in virtual environments is the
behavior or movement characteristics of subjects in virtual
environments [8].  Recent work by Feldman and col-
leagues [18] specifically compared movements made with
or to virtual objects in a VE to movements made with or
to real objects in real environments. Virtual representa-
tions of the hand were obtained by combining a fiber
optic glove with a prehension force feedback device. Ori-
entation of the hand in the VE was achieved using an elec-
tromagnetic tracker while kinematic data of the arm and
trunk were recorded as the participant reached separately
to real and virtual targets. Minimal movement differences
in spatial and temporal kinematics of reaching in healthy
adults were identified and included the amount of termi-
nal wrist and elbow extension as well as timing of maxi-
mal grip aperture. There were no differences in movement
characteristics between the real and virtual task in partici-
pants with hemiparesis. The authors suggest that VR is
similar enough to reality to provide an effective training
environment for rehabilitation.

In contrast, we have demonstrated significant differences
between functional lateral reach performances when per-
formed in the real environment versus in a virtual envi-
ronment delivered on a flatscreen [19].  The VR
technology, VIVID Group's IREX system, provided partic-
ipants with a third-person view of the users themselves in
the virtual environments where they acted on virtual
objects. Both young and old adults reached significantly
further when virtual objects were presented in the VE
compared to when reaches were made to real objects pre-
sented in the periphery. Lateral stability is crucial for per-
formance of many weight-bearing tasks including turning,
transferring, and stepping onto a stool while controlling a
reach made as far as possible to the side requires regula-
tion of the position of the center of mass within the limits
of stability. We proposed that embedding the reaching
task within a VR application may have resulted in shifting
attention away from the potential for loss of balance,
whereas focusing attention on balance, such as in the real-
environment, may have resulted in increased fear of desta-
bilization and underestimation of true ability.
Improving the functional abilities of patients is com-
monly achieved by using tasks of increasing difficulty in
combination with physical and/or verbal guidance of the
patient's movements or actions. Thus, integrating the
means to modulate the level of difficulty within a VR task
is of crucial importance. A virtual reality system (VIVID
GX) was used to provide independent leisure opportuni-
ties to adults with cerebral palsy and severe intellectual
disabilities who were non-speaking and who used wheel-
chairs for mobility [15]. The participants demonstrated an
exceptional degree of enthusiasm during the VR experi-
ences reacting with appropriate, goal-oriented responses.
However, a small number of participants clearly displayed
involuntary movement synergies, increased reflexes and
maladaptive postures, which were attributed to the level
of task difficulty. The ability to change the virtual environ-
ment relatively easily, to grade task difficulty and to adapt
it according to the patient's capabilities are important
advantages of VR, since these features are essential to cog-
nitive and motor remediation [20].
Does the technology work?
Transfer of training
Central to the issue of virtual environments as a training
medium is the issue of transfer of training; does task
improvement or learning transfer reliably from a VE to a
real environment? Virtual environments and VR interven-
tions should not only be used to augment current ability
or to provide exposure to "other" therapeutic possibilities,
but importantly to demonstrate distinct carryover to real-
life functional tasks. One major challenge is identifying
effective and motivating intervention tools that enable
transfer of the skills and abilities achieved during rehabil- 
itation to function in the "real" world. For example, recent
studies stress that simple repetitive movements of an
affected limb are not productive for the reorganization
process but that it is action related to skill acquisition
which contribute to the desired effect [21].
Rose and colleagues studied the transfer of training of a
simple sensorimotor virtual task to performance on the
"real world" equivalent [22]. The real-world equivalent
consisted of a curved wire suspended between two vertical
supports. With the non-preferred hand, the subject held a
rod with a wire loop at the end and guided the loop along
the wire without touching it. Contact between loop and
wire, defined as an error, produced feedback. Errors and
time to complete task were recorded. The group provided
with no practice did significantly worse that the two prac-
tice groups, one practicing with the virtual task and one
practicing with the real task, although with no difference
between the type of practice performed. In other words,
within the constraints of this task, final real-world per-
formance benefited as much from real as virtual practice.
Thus, it is not sufficient simply to demonstrate that train-
ing does transfer in a given situation. It is crucial to iden-
tify whether a specific skill or a general familiarity with the
training context is being transferred. If specific skills are
transferred, it is important to determine whether the
transferred training lasts as long and as reliably as an
equivalent amount of real world training [22]. In addi-
tion, the conditions such as degree of immersiveness,
overlap between real and virtual tasks, must be under-
stood if we are to optimize or facilitate transfer.
Balance and Posture
Several systems have been used in studies of balance
including a combined HMD display system combined
with a fixed bicycle, a flatscreen VR system providing pri-
marily 2D visual information and more recently an
immersive dynamic virtual environment combined with a
posture platform.
Kim et al [23] reported preliminary data from healthy
adults using a bicycle linked to a virtual visual environ-
ment and suggested that this training system would be
beneficial for postural balance control. They described
decreases in cycling path deviation and increases in
cycling velocity following a short training period and sug-
gested that these variables, in conjunction with additional
parameters, may be relevant for determining a training
effect on balance rehabilitation. Several problems remain
to be resolved including the limited integration of bicycle
motion and auditory cues. A specific concern is that a
fixed bike was used which could provide the degree of
safety necessary for an individual with a significant
amount of balance impairment. However, a fixed bike sets
up incongruence between the expectation of lean/tilt of

the bike when covering a curved path and the sensory
information indicating no tilt.
Multiple applications of flatscreen VR for balance training
have been reported that have used video capture technol-
ogy from VividGroup's GX or IREX systems [see for exam-
ple, [9,10,24-26]]. The systems take a video image of the
user and use color subtraction software to remove a mon-
ochrome background and insert the user into a virtual
environment. Proprietary software is used to allow the
user to interact with virtual objects within the VE. Appli-
cations that have been used in various studies include: 1)
a juggling task where the participant is required to reach
laterally to juggle virtual balls; 2) a conveyer belt task
where the participant is required to turn sideways, pick up
a virtual box from a virtual conveyer belt, turn and deposit
the box on a second virtual conveyer belt; and 3) a snow-
board task where the user is required to lean sideways to
avoid trees, rocks and other virtual objects while boarding
down a hill. The applications are modifiable allowing the
task difficulty to be modified by increasing the number of
virtual objects to contact, increasing the speed at which
the objects or environment moves, or increasing and
decreasing the height of the objects requiring users to
reach to the ground or to step up onto a stool. One of the
earliest reports of use of the technology in rehabilitation
compared therapy delivered through VR to a conventional
approach in a sample of frail, older adults [25]. Greater
improvements in dynamic standing tolerance were
reported for a small (n = 3 to 4) group of older adults fol-
lowing a VR therapy than for a small group (n = 3 to 4 per
group) following a standard occupational therapy pro-
gram.
We have used a similar approach with a significantly
larger study population of community-living individuals
with traumatic brain injury [see [9,10,26] for preliminary
data]. A six week, three sessions per week intervention
trial compared an activity-based exercise program (ABE)
with a VR-based exercise program (VRE). Both exercise
programs resulted in clinically significant changes on the
Community Balance and Mobility Scale (CB&M) [27],
used to measure functional mobility and balance, with
average improvements of 6 and 10 points recorded for the
ABE and VRE groups, respectively. Although not all partic-
ipants involved in the exercise programs improved on
their balance measures, 10 out of 14 individuals in the
VRE group and 4 out of 10 individuals in the ABE group
had clinically significant improvements. Most recently, we
have demonstrated significant improvements in balance
and functional mobility in community-living older adults
following a VR exercise program. The comparison group
completed a biofeedback exercise program and also dem-
onstrated significant balance improvement [24].
Although these two studies did not demonstrate signifi- 
cantly greater improvements in balance outcome with the
VR exercise program relative to the comparison interven-
tion, other benefits of VR were identified. Specifically, the
participants in the VR programs indicated greater enthusi-
asm about the exercise programs and reported greater
enjoyment and improved confidence. The implications of
these psychosocial benefits for long-term exercise compli-
ance and participation have yet to be determined.
More recently, Keshner and colleagues [4] have united an
immersive dynamic virtual environment projected onto a
wall with a linear accelerator (sled) that is translated in the
anterior-posterior direction. Study participants stand on
the sled in front of a screen on which a virtual image is
projected. Various combinations of inputs (i.e., translat-
ing the support surface, moving the virtual scene, or com-
bining different motions) are used to determine responses
elicited when conflicts of different magnitudes between
visual and vestibular/somatosensory signals are delivered.
The results of initial experiments clearly demonstrate the
non-linear effect in the postural response from single ver-
sus different combinations of inputs. These findings sug-
gest that using this or similar complex, multimodal
environments for rehabilitation intervention would pro-
mote ongoing recalculation of sensory inputs that would
result in appropriate updates of posture within realistic
environmental contexts.
Locomotion
Patients with Parkinson's disease akinesia have little diffi-
culty stepping over objects in their path even when they
are totally unable to initiate a step on open ground [28].
A virtual display superimposed over a user's visual field,
augmented reality, has been shown to initiate and sustain
walking in akinetic Parkinson's patients. Reiss and col-
leagues [28] reported that a stable cue appearing about six
inches in front of the toes was required to initiate the first
step, while cues scrolling toward the feet, as if stable on
the ground as the person moves, were needed to sustain
walking. The effectiveness of the visual cue was dependent
on the degree and type of akinesia with, as a general rule,
more realistic cues needed as the severity of akinesia
increases.
A locomotor interface, GaitMaster2 (GM2), intended to
provide the user with the sense of forward movement
while his/her actual position in space is constant, has
been tested with two individuals with hemiplegia follow-
ing a stroke [29]. The user stands on two footpads that
move individually with each user's foot providing a sense
of movement over a virtual terrain. The footpads in the
GM2 follow the trajectory of a healthy individual when
walking. The user thus experiences a corrected foot trajec-
tory for each step. Modifications in gait patterns of two
hemiplegic patients following gait training with the GM2

included moderate improvements in gait speed, improve-
ments in leg muscle activity, increased symmetry during
gait and improvement in QOL.
A VR-enhanced orthopedic appliance for use with individ-
uals with spinal cord injuries has also been developed and
links a gait-inducing exoskeleton to a HMD providing
binocular visual displays [30]. Briefly, the exoskeleton
consists of a semi-rigid sling that supports the bust and
lower limbs of the user. The sling is equipped with small
actuators that move the lower extremities in accordance
with human gait. Preliminary results from two experimen-
tal sessions with the same patient, a 26-year old with com-
plete paraplegia, showed improvements in self-
confidence, higher levels of optimism and motivation as
well as increased relaxation and activity scores.
A novel VR application for locomotor rehabilitation cou-
ples a three dimensional visual scene with a self-paced
treadmill [31]. Briefly, both treadmill speed and scene
progression are based on real-time feedback of subject
position and progression with the speed of walking
adjusted easily by the individual user. Preliminary trials of
the system provided subjects with varying levels of inter-
action with the scene surface and surrounding objects
with a strong sense of presence reported by users. Ongo-
ing work by the group includes development and evalua-
tion of a training protocol for locomotor rehabilitation in
individuals with stroke.
Upper and Lower Extremity Function
Several upper and lower extremity VR applications have
been developed using different technologies. Preliminary
data suggest potential benefits of various systems. For
example, a report based on two case studies using the
Vivid GX video capture technology demonstrates
improvements in upper extremity function [32]. The first
individual had a T9 complete spinal cord injury requiring
use of wheelchair for all mobility activities. His primary
rehabilitation goal was to improve sitting balance in order
to enable him to perform functional activities such as
reaching out for a book placed on a shelf. Analysis of vid-
eotaped records of performance revealed that initially he
used only one hand at a time to interact with the virtual
objects while leaving the other on his lap or on the wheel-
chair arm rest in order to maintain balance. As sessions
with the VR system progressed, he began to use both
hands during the tasks relying on weak trunk muscles to
maintain balance. The second individual had a right hem-
ispheric stroke and ambulated with a cane due to poor
control of foot and poor standing balance. He had func-
tional movement in the upper extremity, suffered from
mild attention deficit and required some help when dress-
ing the lower extremity. The application he used consisted
of balls appearing in the VE from all sides requiring that 
he pay attention to the entire visual space. After 3 minutes
of interaction, he asked to get up and continue with ther-
apy while in a standing position (although therapist
behind was necessary for safety).  Both participants
reported enjoyment and wanted to repeat experience if
possible. Importantly, they acknowledged the relevance
of the experience to their rehabilitation process.
Holden and colleagues [33] developed a VE training sys-
tem based on the principle of learning by imitation. Pre-
recorded movements of a virtual 'teacher' are displayed as
either movements of the limb's endpoint or as an entire
arm. Patient movements are recorded using an electro-
magnetic tracking device for the arm and hand segment or
a CyberGlove for hand kinematics. The "teacher" shows
the patient the trajectory of the end-point (hand) path for
the movement to be reproduced. Frequency of visual feed-
back, speed of motion, degree of movement synchroniza-
tion and other aspects of the teacher-patient relationship
can be modulated. Data from eight chronic post-stroke
patients demonstrated variable improvements on clinical
measures of upper extremity function including strength.
Piron et al. [34] used a virtual reality task to assess func-
tional motor progress of a group of 20 post-stroke patients
undergoing conventional rehabilitation. The patients
were required to move an envelope instrumented with a
magnetic receiver to a virtual mailbox slot. The participant
was provided with a view of the trajectory of the corre-
sponding virtual envelope as it moved. Patients improved
on reach velocity and reach duration with the changes
related to improvements on a clinical measure of upper
extremity voluntary movement. The authors suggest that
the reach trajectory characteristics also improved although
limited data were presented. Several questions however
remain. Primarily, would similar changes in movement
trajectories be observed if the subject did not "see" a vir-
tual mailbox? Moreover, in this paradigm, the trajectory
to the mailbox is only one aspect of the functional task
while an equally, if not more important task component
is the orientation of the envelope once it reaches the mail-
box slot. This emphasizes the need to adequately charac-
terize and represent the functional task to be practiced
within the VE.
The Rutgers ankle and hand systems, both incorporating
the haptic sense, were developed as assessment and inter-
vention tools although there are limited clinical data
available at this time regarding efficacy [see [35,36]]. The
two systems combine force feedback with a virtual envi-
ronment that requires subjects to complete various tasks
such as a virtual PegBoard task as well as reach-to-grasp
(hand system) or piloting a virtual airplane through loops
(ankle system). Preliminary data suggest that the systems
may be useful to augment rehabilitation in patients in the

chronic phase following stroke. A recent study using the
hand system demonstrated transfer of skills acquired with
the VR system to a functional clinical outcome measure as
well as improvement on a variety of movement parame-
ters with greatest benefit recorded in the least impaired
patients [37].
Exercise and pain tolerance
Chuang et al [38] compared physiological responses of
the cardiovascular and respiratory systems during incre-
mental exercise testing with and without VR in healthy
older adults. A mechanically braked bicycle was linked to
a visual virtual scene projected on a flatscreen display. The
rate of subject movement on the bicycle matched the envi-
ronmental flow on the screen and included a 5 km
straight or curved road bordered by grass, trees, seashore
background and street lamps. No differences were
observed on submaximal and peak exercise responses but
the cycling with the VR scenario resulted in longer mean
values for cycling duration, distance and energy consump-
tion. It is possible that performing the exercises while
immersed in a comfortable environment resulted in an
increased degree of relative tolerance.
Positive outcomes of virtual reality as a distractive tech-
nique have also been reported for physiotherapy treat-
ment sessions. Hoffman and colleagues [39] report
decreased anxiety and reductions in self-report of pain
from a single-pediatric patient undergoing post-operative
physiotherapy. The child underwent single event multi-
level surgery including femoral de-rotation osteotomy,
quadriceps tendon translocation and release of the Achil-
les and hamstring tendons. Children experience high lev-
els of post-operative pain association with physiotherapy
treatments despite standardized pharmacological analge-
sia. Effective use of VR as a non-pharmacological analge-
sia for patients post-surgery may result in greater therapy
gains.
Assessment
Although the majority of VR environments that have been
developed for assessment to date focus on daily living
skills such as meal preparation [40], spatial memory [8]
and cognitive function [41], specific applications have
been developed for assessment of upper and lower
extremity motor function, balance and locomotion. For
example, two separate assessment approaches using the
PHANTOM haptic interface, a 6 degree of freedom meas-
uring device for positional input that provides feedback
force in translation and rotation have been developed.
Broeren et al [42,43] used a relatively simple task requir-
ing the user to reach for, grasp and move the visual repre-
sentation of the device from a home position to nine
separate locations in the visual field. Preliminary data sug-
gest that this is a potential tool for identifying specific def- 
icits of movement such as timing or accuracy that vary
across patients. A more complex use of the technology,
labyrinth navigation, has been used to isolate more subtle
aspects of movement in patients with neurological disease
including tremor amplitude and frequency, movement
control, and speed of advancement through the labyrinth
[44].
Assessments can be developed using VR technologies that
will provide objective, repeatable and quantitative results.
Standardized instructions, non-varying environmental
cues, tasks and feedback can be achieved. In the extreme
condition, interactions are limited to those between the
patient and a virtual assessor. Since the devices are pro-
grammable, varying the complexity of assessment tasks is
relatively trivial allowing for batteries of simple and more
complex tasks to be developed. For example, an upper
extremity assessment scale may include tasks requiring
self-selected motion as well as responses to force perturba-
tions permitting assessment of feedback limb control.
Access to rehabilitation
The degree of functional movement outcome achieved by
therapy is often sub-optimal since intensive therapy is
limited by resource allocation and access. For many indi-
viduals, such as traumatic brain injury survivors, access to
therapy is terminated once a level of function is achieved
even if residual deficits remain. For other individuals,
even when therapy is available such as during in-patient
neurological rehabilitation, low levels of interaction
between the patient and environment have been reported
[45,46]. For example, Tinson [46] reported that individu-
als post stroke typically spent only 20â60 minutes per day
in formal therapy. Common problems influencing the
degree of interaction include boredom, fatigue, lack of
motivation and lack of cooperation in attending therapy
[47]. Clinicians agree that such problems are undesirable
and restrict progress in rehabilitation. Increasing interac-
tion is seen as vital to effective rehabilitation, a fact borne
out by experimental studies of recovery after brain dam-
age [48]. Development and incorporation of virtual real-
ity applications in rehabilitation may increase the
possibility of stimulation and interaction with the world
with potentially little or no increase on the demands of
staff time. Virtual reality may provide interesting and
engaging tasks that are more motivating than formal
repetitive therapy. In fact, our recent experience compar-
ing participant perceptions of exercise programs strongly
suggest there is added benefit with VR compared to a con-
ventional program (M Thornton et al, unpublished data).
For example, the son of a TBI survivor participating in a
VR balance retraining program noted We have tried in the
past to have him involved in things but he seemed uninterested.
With these exercises (referring to a VR-exercise balance
retraining program) he was trying to explain what he was

doing, he was interested in what he was doing, he was looking
forward to going.
Summary
An exponentially increasing number of distinct VR appli-
cations are being developed for intervention and assess-
ment of a broad range of motor rehabilitation needs
including upper and lower extremity function, balance
and locomotion. Although the initial VR rehabilitation
applications that were developed, in particular applica-
tions using video capture technologies and most HMDs,
were subjected to relatively prohibitive entry level costs
associated with the technology, recent developments in
technology have made the number of low-cost multisen-
sory VR applications increasingly available. Significant
decreases in the costs associated with HMDs and motion
trackers, desktop computers and certain haptic devices,
are facilitating the development of low cost off-the-shelf
applications.
The applications reviewed in this paper have demon-
strated improvements of specific motor function with cer-
tain populations. It is clear that many of the applications
that have been developed, for example gait trainers, will
serve a specific rehabilitation niche. These devices have
the potential to significantly extend our current under-
standing of movement and therapy and may substantially
impact delivery of rehabilitation interventions. Critical for
continued successful integration of virtual reality in motor
rehabilitation is the need for the ongoing development
and use of the technology to be based on clear under-
standing of the complexity of voluntary movement [49].
Sensorimotor integration, movement production, learn-
ing and transfer as well as psychosocial benefits are critical
issues to address in ongoing and future studies. Of crucial
importance is the fundamental question "Can the same
objective be accomplished with a simpler approach".
Prior to adoption of novel rehabilitation approaches
including virtual reality based applications, users must
assess whether the VR technology will provide any addi-
tional benefits to that of well trained and experienced
therapists.
