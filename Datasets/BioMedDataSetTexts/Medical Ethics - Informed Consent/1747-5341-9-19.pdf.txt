Informed consent in the psychosis prodrome:
ethical, procedural and cultural considerations
Sarah E Morris1* and Robert K Heinssen2
Abstract
Research focused on the prodromal period prior to the onset of psychosis is essential for the further development
of strategies for early detection, early intervention, and disease pre-emption. Such efforts necessarily require the
enrollment of individuals who are at risk of psychosis but have not yet developed a psychotic illness into research
and treatment protocols. This work is becoming increasingly internationalized, which warrants special consideration
of cultural differences in conceptualization of mental illness and international differences in health care practices
and rights regarding research participation. The process of identifying and requesting informed consent from
individuals at elevated risk for psychosis requires thoughtful communication about illness risk and often involves
the participation of family members. Empirical studies of risk reasoning and decisional capacity in young people
and individuals with psychosis suggest that most individuals who are at-risk for psychosis can adequately provide
informed consent; however ongoing improvements to tools and procedures are important to ensure that this work
proceeds with maximal consideration of relevant ethical issues. This review provides a discussion of these issues in
the context of international research efforts.

Introduction
Evidence that increased duration of untreated psychosis
is related to worse outcomes, including delay in medica-
tion response [1], more severe symptoms [2], and earlier
relapse [3],  has invigorated clinical research efforts to
identify individuals who are likely to develop psychosis
prior to the onset of full-blown illness. Accumulated
data now clearly indicates that psychosis onset is typic-
ally predated by a prodromal phase which is of variable
length and starts in early adolescence or late childhood.
Research approaches focused on individuals who are
variously described as ultra-high risk (UHR),  clinical
high risk (CHR), or having at-risk mental state (ARMS)
have allowed researchers to address the psychopatho-
logical and neurobiological underpinnings of the puta-
tive prodromal state for psychosis and to test new
interventions aimed at preventing or delaying the devel-
opment of psychosis.

Further work is needed to improve predictive accur-
acy, understand underlying neurobiological mechanisms,
and develop rational strategies for interventions aimed
at pre-empting illness. This ambitious research agenda
will entail enrolling large numbers of individuals who
are at risk of psychosis into research protocols. Much of
the prior work on psychosis risk has been conducted in
Western countries but a crucial aspect of future work
will be to examine similarities and differences in the
psychosis trajectory among different countries and cul-
tures. Expanding this research agenda in non-Western
countries confers at least two scientific advances: it al-
lows the scientific community to examine the ways in
which the patterns of risk and outcomes vary among
countries and allows larger, more definitive and repre-
sentative studies. International expansion of psychosis
risk research requires careful consideration of the ethical
and cultural issues involved in obtaining informed con-
sent from young adults judged to be at heightened risk
for psychotic illness. Differences in economic and
healthcare opportunities, scientific worldview, and insti-
tutional practices among countries and cultures require
careful consideration of ethical research practices and

the consideration the economic, linguistic and social char-
acteristics of the individual and the local environment [4].
In this article, we review research relevant to these issues
and make suggestions regarding the informed consent
process.
Review
Identifying at-risk individuals
A number of clinical criteria have been suggested and
tested to identify subjects with an increased risk of de-
veloping psychosis within a relatively short period of
time [5,6].  Converging evidence shows that individuals
at high clinical risk for psychosis who present with sub-
threshold and attenuated psychotic symptoms and signs
have an enhanced liability for developing a psychotic dis-
order over time. For some of these individuals, these
sub-syndromal symptoms will prove to be early manifes-
tations of psychotic illness. For others, the symptoms
will persist without exacerbation and may not become
the focus of clinical attention or may resolve entirely
over time. A recent meta-analysis of more than 2500
high risk subjects quantified such vulnerability, showing
a transition risk that increased from 18% after six
months to 36% after three years following first presenta-
tion [7]. Notably, most of the subjects who later develop
a psychotic illness will transition to an ICD/DSM schizo-
phrenia spectrum psychosis (73%) rather than to an
affective psychotic illness (11%,  Risk Ratio = 5.4) [8].
The high risk state is usually associated with distressing
symptoms, impaired quality of life and subtle, albeit sig-
nificant, deficits in cognitive functioning [9]. At a neuro-
biological level, there are alterations in brain structure
[10,11], function [12], connectivity [13] and neurochem-
istry [14-17]. Some of these brain abnormalities are asso-
ciated with the high risk state, while others are dynamic
predictors of the longitudinal development of psychosis
[18]. New treatments to reduce the disability associated
with sub-threshold symptoms or to prevent the frank
onset of illness are being investigated [19,20].
Differences in health care systems and patterns of re-
ferral for specialized care affect the ways in which high
risk individuals can be identified for research purposes
and the implementation of intervention research. Base
rates of self-reported psychosis prodrome symptoms ap-
pear to differ among countries [21,22],  thus impacting
estimates of prevalence and conversion rates. Transla-
tion and validation of the measures used to detect the
psychosis risk state facilitates data sharing and integra-
tion across countries and cultures. For example, the
Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes (SIPS)
has been translated into Korean and validated with a
sample of 40 subjects, 12.5% of whom developed psych-
osis during a one-year follow-up period [23]. Reliability 
of the SIPS has also been tested in Japan [24].  Another
measure, the PRIME screening tool, has been studied in a
variety of countries and languages, including Kenya [25],
Mexico [22], and Japan [26]. Further work is needed to de-
termine the extent to which differences in rates of psychosis
risk symptoms among countries reflect actual variation in
prevalence or are due to differences in screening proce-
dures, willingness to report symptoms, or other factors.
Communicating the nature of the prodrome
At the time of recruitment into a prodromal psychosis
study, many high risk patients are already experiencing de-
pression, anxiety, changes in thinking, problems in basic
cognition, and social impairment [27-31]; some may already
be receiving psychosocial or pharmacological [32] treat-
ment. For these individuals, questions about diagnosis,
likely outcomes, and treatment options are common. For
others who may not previously have thought of themselves
as being at risk of mental illness, the invitation to partici-
pate in a psychosis risk study is likely to stimulate similar
questions. Heinssen and colleagues [32], summarizing the
results of an NIMH-sponsored workshop on informed
consent in early psychosis research, recommended three
specific “informed consent bullets” that should be commu-
nicated to potential participants regarding the nature of
psychosis risk:
1. Individuals who are at increased risk of psychosis
compared to the general population can be
identified with acceptable reliability by using
structured instruments administered by trained
personnel. Among people who meet at-risk criteria,
however, we are currently unable to predict precisely
who will go on to develop a psychotic disorder and
who will not.
2. Transition to psychosis is not inevitable or
predetermined for individuals who are identified as
being as risk. Research suggests that about 36% of
individuals who meet clinical risk criteria will
develop psychosis within three years [33]. Psychosis
risk for any individual will vary depending on factors
such as family history, symptom severity, and
change in functioning but it is important to
communicate that serious mental illness is not
foreordained. However, independent from the risk of
developing a psychotic disorder, vulnerable subjects
often experience co-occurring problems and
disability which can be more distressing than
prodromal symptoms themselves. Thus, it is
important to inform prospective research
participants about outcomes other than psychosis in
the process of requesting informed consent.
3. At present, we do not have enough research to
definitively recommend specific treatments for

persons who are at risk for psychosis. Findings from
pharmacotherapy studies do not support broad use
of antipsychotic medications as a first-line treatment
approach with at-risk individuals [20]. However,
cognitive behavioral therapy, family work, substance
abuse prevention, and cognitive remediation are
among promising psychological treatment
approaches that appear effective during the earliest
stages of the prodrome [34]. All of these options, as
well as other reasonable medication and
psychosocial interventions for treating subjects’
presenting problems, should be disclosed to
potential subjects as potential alternative treatment
options [35].
In summary, the decision to provide consent should be
informed by a full explanation of what is currently known
about the psychosis prodrome, specifically, that many indi-
viduals who are at clinical risk do not develop psychosis,
and that among those who don’t, some have complete
resolution of symptoms while others may develop disor-
ders other than psychosis [36-38]. It is equally important
to convey what is not known, most importantly that it is
not possible to predict whether any given individual will
eventually develop psychosis. Given the range of difficul-
ties observed among at-risk individuals, however, potential
research participants should also understand that a poten-
tial benefit of research participation includes the possibil-
ity of receiving early and effective intervention should a
disorder develop, and the possibility of reduced distress
from the prodromal or at-risk symptoms per se [39].
Competence, capacity and coercion
Studies of the psychosis prodrome require large samples
of high risk individuals who are willing to be followed over
considerable periods of time. Both up-front refusal and
downstream attrition threaten the quality and quantity of
research in this area, but it is paramount that the informed
consent process be conducted in a non-coercive manner.
Many of the issues related to consent processes apply
broadly to all areas of medical research but others are
more specifically relevant to psychosis risk research due to
cultural differences in ideas about mental illness, stigma,
the involvement of predominantly adolescent individuals
and the role of the family in consent and research pro-
cesses. A full review of these shared and specific consider-
ations is beyond the scope of this review but a selective
review is provided here.
Cultural differences in doctor-patient relationship and
communication [40], attitudes toward personal autonomy
and individualism, and institutional trust, and language
and social class differences [41,42] should be taken into
consideration when formulating procedures related to
obtaining informed consent so that potential participants 
may feel fully free to ask questions about the study and to
decline to participate. In Japan, as an example, there is an
effort to increase the use of informed consent for medical
procedures and reduce paternalism in the doctor-patient
relationship while preserving the autonomy of the phys-
ician [43]. It isn’t always possible to reduce real or per-
ceived power or status differentials between study staff
and potential participants and methods for addressing
these factors which may affect the consent process will
vary depending on the details of the research project and
the setting. Care should, of course, be taken to ensure that
informed consent documents can be understood by all po-
tential participants. To maximize the exercise of personal
choice in the consent process in cultures in which defer-
ence to authority is high, for example, research staff may
want to avoid having a physician who is in a leadership
role in the study approach potential participants for
consent.
Specific to studies of mental illness, culture-based dif-
ferences in understandings of psychiatric symptoms [44]
might impact potential participants’  reasoning about
study participation. For example, spiritual attributions
about the causes of mental disorders are prevalent in
many cultures [45,46] or individuals may have a combin-
ation of biomedical and indigenous beliefs about the
causes and treatment of mental disorders [47].  Inter-
national differences in laws regulating the treatment of
persons with mental illness affect procedures for enrolling
individuals in research protocols. For example, in Japan
and Korea, obtaining informed consent for treatment of
psychiatric patients is a relatively new practice and, as a
result, novel measures for assessing competency to con-
sent to treatment have been developed [48,49],  which
could be also useful for research purposes.
Informed consent for research participation is predi-
cated on the assumption that the prospective participant
is competent to give consent as evidenced by the ability to
(1) understand relevant study information, including the
reasons why they are being asked to participate, the proce-
dures that they will be asked to undergo, and how to dis-
continue their participation); (2) appreciate the nature and
consequences of accepting or declining the invitation to
participate; (3) manipulate information rationally while
making decisions; and (4) communicate a choice [50,51].
Given the complexity of most informed consent docu-
ments and many research studies, it is not surprising that
misunderstanding of consent documents and procedures
such as randomization and blinded assignment to experi-
mental groups and misconceptions about the purposes of
research (i.e., the “therapeutic misconception”) are wide-
spread [52]. Many instruments for assessing understand-
ing of study information and decisional capacity have been
developed [53] and they vary in their content, format,
standardization, administration and psychometrics [54].

Different standards and cutoff scores have been used to
determine decisional capacity in studies of individuals with
psychosis, and although it is appropriate for stringency to
differ depending upon the nature of the study-associated
risks, it is important for investigators to consider a priori
the impact of implementing different criteria on the
screening and capacity determination outcomes [55]. It is
also important to keep in mind that if a patient has cap-
acity to provide consent for one type of study or interven-
tion, it does not necessarily mean they have capacity to
consent for other procedures [56] and that different mea-
sures of consent capacity will be appropriate for different
settings and studies, depending on factors such as the de-
gree of risk involved in the study procedures and the par-
ticipants’ illness severity [54].
Competence and capacity for providing informed con-
sent among individuals at risk for psychosis has rarely
been the focus of empirical research, however, the results
of an increasing number of studies of these processes in
people with psychosis [57] may be informative for shaping
policies and procedures for prodrome studies. Evidence
that most schizophrenia patients are competent to provide
informed consent [58-61] and anecdotal reports from
large studies of at-risk individuals [62] suggest that most
individuals who are at clinical or genetic risk for psychosis
are competent to provide consent. There is, however, sub-
stantial variability in decisional capacity among schizo-
phrenia patients and non-patients [61],  so it must be
assumed that at least some candidates for psychosis risk
studies may not meet these standards for competence.
Poor performance on a measure of decisional capacity has
been associated with cognitive impairment and, to a lesser
degree, with positive and negative symptoms of psychosis
[55,60].
Various types of educational efforts to enhance decisional
capacity in individuals with schizophrenia have demon-
strated efficacy, with some interventions successfully elim-
inating the disparity between patients and non-patients in
understanding the elements of informed consent [63].
Thus, when considering whether a potential participant is
capable of consenting to participate, the staff administering
informed consent may want to consider whether dimin-
ished cognition or sub-syndromal symptoms are affecting
decisional capacity and whether an enhanced consenting
process with additional educational content might be
appropriate.
When research is conducted in a clinical setting or
with individuals who are already engaged with clinical
systems, it is important for investigators to clearly de-
scribe which procedures are being done as part of the
research protocol rather than clinical care and for partic-
ipants to understand whether and how their decision to
participate in research will affect their clinical care. It
can be a challenge when clinical staff are assisting with 
subject recruitment, assessment or treatments, but partici-
pants should clearly understand the roles of the clinical and
research staff members and effort should be made to avoid
giving participants the impression that clinicians are pres-
suring them to provide consent for research participation.
Increasingly, research on psychosis risk has focused on
the possible impact of immigration and status as a social
minority [64]. Such studies require participation of immi-
grants and/or family members of immigrants, who might
have cultural norms that are different than the dominant
norms in their country of residence and might be less
aware of their rights (both to participate and to decline
participation) and more vulnerable to coercion [41]. When
outreach and informed consent procedures are developed
for use in these populations, particular care should be
taken to ensure that potential participants understand the
boundaries between study personnel and government offi-
cials. Studies may consider coordinating outreach efforts
through cultural groups and organization in the local
community in order to overcome cultural barriers to re-
search participation [65].
With its massive population centers well-suited for the
recruitment of large samples of at-risk individuals, several
new research projects on the psychosis prodrome have fo-
cused their efforts in China. Pointing to the feasibility of
such studies, methods used for identification and enroll-
ment of at-risk individuals have been successfully adapted
and implemented in a Chinese setting to recruit a sample
with characteristics, including conversion rates, that are
similar to those in large psychosis risk studies in other
countries [66]. The new national Mental Health Law of
China emphasizes de-stigmatization, prevention, and pa-
tient rights [67]. The law’s provision that inpatient treat-
ment of mental disorders “shall generally be voluntary”
reflects a change from the previously widespread assump-
tion that psychiatric patients are unable to make decisions
regarding inpatient treatment and the nearly ubiquitous
practice that guardians made decisions regarding treat-
ment [68]. In a study of consent competence among inpa-
tients with schizophrenia in Hunan province, China, 28%
of patients with schizophrenia were classified as compe-
tent to provide consent on the basis of their score on the
Semi-structured Inventory for Competence Assessment
[69],  compared to 40% in a similar study conducted in
London [70].  Despite a substantial minority of patients
with capacity to consent, all of the consent documents for
inpatient treatment for study participants had been signed
by guardians. Among those, 18% were signed by both the
guardian and the patient; however, patient co-signature
was not related to patient score on the capacity assess-
ment. Although this analysis focused specifically on con-
sent for treatment, similar challenges in defining and
determining capacity to consent are present for research
endeavors.

Risk reasoning in adolescence and psychosis
Studies of risk reasoning and decision-making in adoles-
cents and individuals with psychosis can inform the
process of soliciting informed consent with individuals
who are at-risk of developing schizophrenia. Decision-
making in adolescents may be impacted by greater
responsiveness to peer pressure, altered risk perception,
and increased focus on short-term risks and benefits
[71];  these tendencies can affect adolescents’  thinking
about their risk of developing illness as well as their risk
of experiencing discomfort or adverse outcomes related
to participation in a research study or clinical interven-
tion. Variability in the rates of conversion reported in
the research literature adds to the challenge in weighing
the potential risks and benefits of research participation.
A review of the empirical research concerning children’s
competence to provide consent or assent for psycho-
logical and medical treatment and research [72] indi-
cates that some aspects of treatment or research are
understood by children more easily than other aspects
and that understanding increases with age and when un-
derstanding is queried more frequently. The Institute of
Medicine [73] provides guidance for ensuring appropri-
ate levels of decisional support when involving young
people in research.
There is evidence that individuals with schizophrenia
have a propensity to value smaller rewards that are re-
ceived quickly more than larger rewards delivered fur-
ther into the future [74] and that they experience a
foreshortened future time horizon [75]. Decision-making
differences in individuals with early-onset schizophrenia,
characterized by increased sensitivity to reward and de-
creased sensitivity to future outcomes, mirror these find-
ings [76]. Cannabis abuse, a risk factor for schizophrenia
[77,78], has been associated with impaired decision mak-
ing among first-episode patients with schizophrenia-
spectrum psychosis [79].
Although it is not known whether these characteristics
of risk reasoning are also present during the prodromal
period, it is possible that individuals who are asked to
participate in studies of the psychosis prodrome may
tend to downplay the long-term risks and benefits of
participation. Monetary (or other) incentives may be
more highly salient for potential participants who have
already experienced a decline in functioning than for less
impaired individuals with more opportunities for finan-
cial income. Care should be taken to set compensation
at a level that is reasonable and fair but not excessive to
the point that it could be considered to be coercive. This
is an especially important issue for research that is being
conducted in low-income countries where some partici-
pants may be vulnerable to coercive payments due to a
shortage of other opportunities for paid work. In con-
trast, some culturally Asian research participants might 
feel uncomfortable accepting payment for research par-
ticipation because they are not accustomed to being paid
by clinical personnel and payments may arouse suspi-
cion about the purpose of the project [80].
Involving families in informed consent
Research involving individuals at risk for psychosis may
include children as young as 12 years old as well as many
adolescents younger than 18. In these circumstances, adult
family members often play a critical role in subject recruit-
ment and consent activities.
Most studies rely on individuals’ self-report of symp-
toms and experiences to determine eligibility for re-
search participation and for tracking changes in clinical
status and functioning. There is, however, evidence that
patient reports of functioning might be less accurate
than those of high-contact clinicians, friends or family
members [81]. Using a new caregiver-report version of the
12-item Prime Screen-Revised, investigators found that
parent–child agreement about adolescents’ psychosis risk
symptoms was poor, and that incorporating parents’ rat-
ings improved the specificity of at-risk classification [82],
indicating the potential utility of gathering input from col-
lateral informants.
Policies regarding consent procedures differ among coun-
tries and institutions [73] but, generally, before an adoles-
cent can participate in research, informed consent from a
parent and assent from the at-risk adolescent is required.
At the time of recruitment, some family members may be
uninformed about the nature of mental disorders and may
have the incorrect impression that they are to blame for
their family member’s risk status. Family members typically
react with distress upon being informed that their child is
at increased risk of developing psychosis [62,83] and some-
times appear reluctant to engage with research or clinical
staff members. As recommended above for at-risk individ-
uals, family members should be provided with accurate and
up-to-date information about mental illness risk and the
details of the project for which consent is being solicited.
Referrals to sources of information about mental health
and clinical support for family members should be made
available as appropriate.
Parental attitudes can impact medical decisions made
by adolescents and young adults [84] and family mem-
bers often play an important role in research endeavors
by helping to make sure that participants attend ap-
pointments and adhere to study protocols. Furthermore,
parental attitudes, behavior, and coping strategies are as-
sociated with functional outcomes of at-risk youth [85]
and degree of caregiver distress [86].  Despite concerns
about the potentially stigmatizing effects of early identi-
fication, the majority of caregivers for psychiatrically ill
family members report that they would have made use
of clinical services for early detection if they had been
Page 6

Page 6 of 9
given the opportunity, and believe that earlier interven-
tion benefited both their ill family member and them-
selves [87]. A small, U.S.-based study suggests that levels
of stigma are generally low among family members of
prodromal individuals but relatively higher among ethnic
minority families [88]. Research focused on the consent
process is limited, but Li and Seidman [89] provide a
several suggestions regarding family-related issues that
may be involved when working clinically with Asian-
American youth at high risk for psychosis which could
apply to the research consent process. To address con-
cerns regarding stigma, the informed consent process
should include discussion of when clinical information
about the adolescent will be shared or kept confidential
and the circumstances under which family members will
be notified about clinically significant events like suicidal
ideation or intent. Family members should feel sup-
ported by the research team regardless of the decisions
they make regarding research participation.
Sustained consent, clinical contingencies and termination
Because research projects involving at-risk participants
may have multi-year durations and participants’  willing-
ness and capacity to provide consent may change during
their involvement, it is important to ensure that informed
consent is sustained throughout the period of participa-
tion. In an analysis of longitudinal consent-related abilities
in research participants with schizophrenia [90], most par-
ticipants’ capacity to understand study procedures either
stayed steady or improved over time, however, under-
standing declined in approximately one quarter of the par-
ticipants and 4% of participants failed to meet the initial
capacity threshold at one or more follow-up assessment
time point. These findings suggest that it isn’t necessary to
re-evaluate consent capacity for all participants in longitu-
dinal studies. However, predictors of decline in consent-
related abilities like poor cognitive performance at baseline
or worsening positive and negative symptoms over time,
suggest the need to re-assess both capacity and consent
whenever changes in clinical status are observed. Sus-
tained consent procedures should include specification of
the means by which participants may inform study staff if
they wish to discontinue their participation.
One potential benefit of enrolling in a research proto-
col for at-risk individuals is that ongoing monitoring of
clinical symptoms is often provided, allowing rapid de-
tection of symptom escalation. Depending on the nature
of the research activity, staff may need to consider
whether it is appropriate to develop a plan to provide
clinical referrals for persons who are screened for re-
cruitment but, upon further evaluation, do not meet the
study’s eligibility criteria. This plan should take into con-
sideration the practicalities of the local health care sys-
tem. A substantial proportion of individuals enrolled in 
studies of psychosis risk have previously been diagnosed
with a mood or anxiety disorder [66,91] and so ongoing
treatment needs should be taken into consideration when
planning for research participation. Information about
contingencies for handling conversion to full-blown illness
or other psychiatric crises should be included in the in-
formed consent document and discussion and should take
into consideration the points of entry into care systems
that are available to the individual. Some studies allow
psychotic individuals to continue in the protocol while
others discontinue participation upon development of
full-blown illness, with referral of psychotic individuals to
other care providers. Medication trials with a blinded con-
dition may discontinue the blind when psychotic symp-
toms are observed and immediately initiate individualized
treatment. Similarly, it is important for protocols to in-
clude a plan for appropriate continuity of care for partici-
pants at the conclusion of their study participation. The
issue of duration and discontinuation of treatment in lon-
gitudinal studies of psychosis risk is a challenging one be-
cause there is, at present, no method for determining
whether an individual who does not develop psychosis
during the course of a study will never go on to develop
psychosis (i.e.,  a false positive) and can safely withdraw
from treatment or are responsive to the intervention and
likely to develop illness if intervention is discontinued
[92]. Care should be taken to avoid inadvertently convey-
ing during these discussions that the development of
psychosis is inevitable or even more likely than not. Non-
psychosis outcomes that require clinical attention are,
however, common among participants in psychosis risk
studies [36].  Depending on participants’  clinical status,
post-study follow-up might involve referral for ongoing
treatment or education regarding warning signs and self-
monitoring for individuals who are asymptomatic or ex-
periencing subthreshold symptoms.
Beyond the issues of consent and clinical contingencies
for individual participants, researchers who are conducting
their work in low-income countries in which information
about mental illness and resources for treatment may be
limited may want to consider ways in which they can in-
corporate the benefits of research into the local commu-
nity via educational outreach and enhancements to public
health resources and infrastructure [4].
Future directions and considerations
Several important ethical and procedural questions related
to informed consent in psychiatric research require further
consideration and empirical study [93]. For example: How
should fluctuations in decisional capacity be handled?
How can participant advocates be incorporated into the
consent process? What degree of risk is reasonable in
studies that likely include large numbers of individuals
who won’t go on to develop psychosis? It should be noted,
Page 7
Morris and Heinssen Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine 2014, 9:19
http://www.peh-med.com/content/9/1/19 
Page 7 of 9
however, that concerns and questions regarding decisional
capacity and competence are not unique to psychiatric re-
search and unrelated factors such as medical illness and
low education levels can impact the informed consent
process independently of psychiatric status. As in the gen-
eral population, there is great heterogeneity in decisional
capacity and risk reasoning among individuals at risk for
mental disorders and stigmatizing attitudes about the ap-
propriateness of psychiatric research [94] should not be
allowed to unduly hinder important scientific initiatives.
Duration of untreated psychosis is one of the most highly
modifiable illness characteristics and the fact that commu-
nity practitioners already are prescribing antipsychotic
medication to at-risk individuals [32] highlights the tre-
mendous need for this type of work to proceed quickly
and with utmost concern for the rights and welfare of the
study participants so that the care for these individuals
can be informed by the highest quality research.
As this research endeavor becomes increasingly inter-
nationalized, researchers must carefully attend to issues
related to cultural differences in understanding mental
illness, research and consent and international differ-
ences in regulatory requirements. Especially in low-
income countries and communities, care must be taken
to balance the benefits accrued to the research team and
those accrued to participants and to avoid exploitation
of research participants that can result from taking ad-
vantage (either intentionally or unintentionally) of power
differentials among countries and among individuals [4].
Conclusions
Schizophrenia represents a personal tragedy for those
afflicted, a source of sorrow for family members, and a
costly public health concern. Available interventions
cannot cure this devastating disorder, but early interven-
tion may help shift the illness trajectory from chronic
disability to recovery of function. Consequently, scien-
tific efforts to discern the earliest developmental stages
of schizophrenia in the prodromal period must move
forward. Studies conducted to date represent a laudable
step toward the identification of illness onset markers and
suggest treatment approaches that may prevent or delay
the transition to active psychosis. Future investigations are
expected to chart presymptomatic pathways with greater
precision, hopefully uncovering pathogenic mechanisms
that will be targeted in the coming generation of preven-
tion studies. Including diverse cultural perspectives will re-
sult in a more comprehensive knowledge base and will
require investigators to work across international boundar-
ies. These studies will continue to rely on the participation
of competent research subjects who must understand, ap-
preciate, and act on the elements of informed consent pre-
sented in this report.
