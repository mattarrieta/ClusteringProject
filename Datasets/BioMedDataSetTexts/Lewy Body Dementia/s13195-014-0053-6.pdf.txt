Abstract
Introduction: The aim of this review was to investigate whether there is a faster cognitive decline in dementia
with Lewy bodies (DLB) than in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) over time.
Methods: PsycINFO and Medline were searched from 1946 to February 2013. A quality rating from 1 to 15 (best)
was applied to the included studies. A quantitative meta-analysis was done on studies with mini mental state
examination (MMSE) as the outcome measure.
Results: A total of 18 studies were included. Of these, six (36%) reported significant differences in the rate of
cognitive decline. Three studies reported a faster cognitive decline on MMSE in patients with mixed DLB and AD
compared to pure forms, whereas two studies reported a faster decline on delayed recall and recognition in AD
and one in DLB on verbal fluency. Mean quality scores for studies that did or did not differ were not significantly
different. Six studies reported MMSE scores and were included in the meta-analysis, which showed no significant
difference in annual decline on MMSE between DLB (mean 3.4) and AD (mean 3.3).
Conclusions: Our findings do not support the hypothesis of a faster rate of cognitive decline in DLB compared to
AD. Future studies should apply recent diagnostic criteria, as well as extensive diagnostic evaluation and ideally
autopsy diagnosis. Studies with large enough samples, detailed cognitive tests, at least two years follow up and
multivariate statistical analysis are also needed.
Introduction
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer’s dis-
ease (AD) are the two most common subtypes of neurode-
generative dementia, representing 15 to 20% and 65% of
all dementia cases, respectively [1]. DLB is characterized
clinically by symptoms such as visual hallucinations,
Parkinsonism and fluctuating cognition in addition to
cognitive impairment with typically more visuospatial
and executive impairment relative to memory impair-
ment [2].  There is some evidence that DLB patients
have more rapidly progressing dementia compared to
AD [3], and more recent studies also reported a more

severe course with shorter survival [4],  higher rate of
nursing home admissions [5] and higher costs in DLB
as compared to AD [6].
An overlap in neuropathology between AD and DLB
has been noted [7]. Parkinson’s disease (PD) and DLB
also share some clinical and pathological features [8].
Subgroups with different cognitive profiles have been
described in patients with PD [9], and there is evidence
that this differentiation is related to the rate of cogni-
tive decline [10]. Similar neuropsychologically defined
subgroups may exist also in DLB [8],  which could also
predict differences in the rate of progression to end-stage
dementia. Data supports accelerated disease progression
when AD and DLB pathologies are present together [11].
To our knowledge, no systematic review has compared
rate of cognitive decline in DLB versus AD. We therefore
systematically reviewed the literature to find studies
assessing overall cognitive decline in DLB and AD. We

specifically noted studies that had investigated the po-
tential differences in cognitive decline in subgroups
with DLB and the effect of employing different diag-
nostic criteria.
Methods
PsycINFO and Medline were searched in February 2013,
using key words listed in Table 1. References from
reviewed articles were also searched for relevant studies.
The following inclusion criteria were used: a) paper pub-
lished in a peer-reviewed journal; b) written in English;
c) DLB or mixed AD/DLB compared with AD; d) appli-
cation of at least one neuropsychological test, and e) at
least 6 months follow up. The following exclusion criteria
were used: a) drug trials, and b) survival studies with death
as the only outcome.
Quality assessment
Two independent raters rated all studies with a self-
designed quality scale and arrived at the same result. The
domains, a) number of patients included; b) follow-up
time; c) clinical criteria; d) autopsy, and e) neuropsycho-
logical tests) were rated on a four-point scale adapted
from Aarsland et al. (2005) [12]: 0 (none), 1 (poor), 2 (fair)
and 3 (good). See Table 2. Studies could be assigned 1 to
15 points.
Statistical analysis
For studies reporting mini mental state examination
(MMSE) results, standardized mean difference in annual
progression between DLB and AD was calculated as the
difference between annual progression between the DLB
and AD groups divided by the pooled standard deviation
across groups in each included study. The standardized
mean differences were combined in a random-effects
model to obtain summary estimates of the effect in each
study. The overall results from each trial were then com-
bined using a random-effects model to obtain a pooled
summary estimate of effect across all trials [13]. To as-
sess heterogeneity, the I2 as proposed by Higgins and
colleagues [14] was chosen, indicating the percentage of
total variation across studies due to heterogeneity. 
Results
Of the 18 studies included in this review (see Table 3),
six (36%) reported a statistically significant difference in
cognitive decline over time between AD and DLB (see
Table 4). Three studies reported a faster cognitive decline
on cognitive screening tests in the neuropathologically
mixed AD/DLB group [3,15,16] compared to those with
pure AD or DLB. One study reported a faster decline in
DLB than in AD on verbal fluency [17], and two in AD
compared to DLB on memory [18,19]. For a full descrip-
tion of neuropsychological tests used in included studies,
see Table 3.
Six studies either reported annual decline in MMSE
scores, or included data enabling calculation of annual
decline based on reported scores. In AD, mean annual
decline was 3.3 (SD 1.7, range 1.8 to 4.9),  and in DLB
3.4 (SD 1.4, range 1.8 to 5.8). One study also reported
annual decline of 5.0 in AD/DLB (see Figure 1).  The
random-effects meta-analysis revealed an overall effect-
size of −0.035 (negative sign indicates faster progression in
DLB) (P = 0.764; 95% CI = 0.261, 0.192). I2 was 50.3, which
is considered to represent moderate heterogeneity [14].
Cognitive domains
Six studies measured memory, and two reported differ-
ences in memory over time, both a faster decline in AD.
Delayed recall was found to have a faster decline in AD
compared to AD/DLB when measured with the Consor-
tium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease
(CERAD) evaluation, with 15% of patients with AD ver-
sus 32% of patients with AD/DLB remembering any item
at the last evaluation [17].  Recognition was found to
have a faster decline in AD compared to DLB as measured
with Hopkins verbal learning test- revised (HVLT-R)
(scores not available) [19].  Eight studies measuring lan-
guage and ten studies measuring visuospatial ability re-
ported no differences in rate of decline. Seven studies
measured explicit executive functions, and one reported
differences over time. In that study, verbal fluency was
found to have a more rapid decline in DLB compared to
AD, measured with the Cambride cognitive examination
(CAMCOG) (subscores not available) [17].

Subgroups
Two studies [28,30] divided patients into two groups ac-
cording to high or low visuospatial functioning. In the
first study, DLB patients with a low baseline score (<20)
on the Wechsler intelligence scale for children-revised,
block design (WISC-R) and impaired clock drawing test
(CDT) had a faster decline on the dementia rating scale
(DRS),  compared to DLB patients with a high baseline
score. In the latter study, DLB patients with a low base-
line score on the Newcastle visual perception battery
(NEVIP) had a faster decline in activities of daily living
(ADL) than those with higher score, but no difference
on any of the cognitive tests. There were no differences
in the AD groups.
Quality assessment
The mean quality score for all the included studies was
9.4 points (SD 2.5, range 5 to 14) (see Table 5). Only two
studies were rated fair or good on all quality measures
[26,27]. Three studies were rated poor on one variable,
but fair and good on the others [15,16,22]. Mean quality
scores for studies that found any differences in cognitive
decline was 9.8 points (SD 2.4, range 5 to 11) compared
to 9.3 points (SD 2.6, range 5 to 14) in the group with
no differences (P = 0.335).
Clinical and neuropathological diagnostic criteria
There were no systematical differences in clinical or
neuropathological criteria between studies that found
differences in cognitive decline and those who did not
(see Table 6).  Of 18 included studies, 16 (89%) used
National Institute of Neurological and Communication
Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Disorders Association (NINCDS/ADRDA) or CERAD
clinical criteria for AD and 12 (67%) used DLB consen-
sus criteria, only one of them used the revised criteria
from 2005. To diagnose AD neuropathologically, mainly
CERAD neuropathological criteria for the diagnosis of
AD and neuropathological DLB consensus criteria from
1996 were used. A diagnosis of mixed AD/DLB was made,
if in addition to the Alzheimer’s pathology the characteris-
tic Lewy bodies were found in subcortical and cortical 
areas. Eleven studies (61%) used autopsy-confirmed diag-
nosis on all patients. In three studies (17%), some of the
diagnoses were autopsy-confirmed. In four studies (22%)
autopsy was not performed. One of the studies used
123I-FP-CIT-SPECT only as a method of verifying of
clinical diagnosis [31].
Discussion
In the 18 studies included in this review, no consistent
faster rate of decline in DLB as compared to AD on cog-
nitive screening tests was found. When combining stud-
ies that used MMSE, the most frequently used scale, a
meta-analysis revealed no difference in the annual rate
of cognitive decline. There were mixed findings on de-
cline in specific cognitive domains. Two of six studies of
memory found a more rapid decline in AD. Only one of
seven studies of executive function found a more rapid
decline in DLB, and differences in visuospatial or lan-
guage tests were not found. The hypothesis of a more
rapid cognitive decline in autopsied patients with both
AD and DLB pathology was supported in three studies.
However, findings were inconsistent and other studies
did not find differences.
Differences in methods such as selection criteria, de-
sign, neuropsychological tests, dementia severity, diag-
nostic procedures and criteria can explain the diverse
findings and lack of firm conclusions. However, quality
assessment did not reveal any systematic differences be-
tween studies with high or low quality scores. There
were large differences in sample sizes (n = 28 to 315),
and the studies that could not be included in the meta-
analysis or used other tests than MMSE, thus, may have
had varying statistical power to detect significant differ-
ences between groups. To be able to compare the overall
results and draw some general conclusions it would have
been ideal that uniform diagnostic criteria had been used
in all the studies. Some of the studies initially included
patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD only, where ana-
lyses were based on autopsy diagnosis which included
both AD and DLB.
A common weakness in the included studies was the
choice of neuropsychological measures. When studying

cognitive decline over time, cognitive tests that are de-
signed for a specific cognitive domain are required.
Screening tests or batteries that use a total score only,
often designed for purposes other than research are less
suitable. In this review, the MMSE was the most used test,
either alone, or in combination with others. The MMSE
may not be an optimal measure, especially when using
only the total score and not separate subscores for differ-
ent cognitive domains, as AD and DLB have different cog-
nitive profiles at onset [32]. This difference in cognitive
profile leads to difficulties in choosing an optimal cogni-
tive screening instrument to compare AD and DLB. The
MMSE is heavily based on memory and language and is
thus more sensitive to changes in AD than in DLB [33]. 
DLB is associated with a more severe visuospatial def-
icit than AD [32,34],  but only 1 of 30 points on the
MMSE comes from a measure of visuospatial function-
ing. MMSE may also be less than optimal because of
the ceiling and floor effect [35], which refers to a test
being too easy or too difficult to discriminate below or
above a certain point, which is a common problem
when testing people with dementia. In one of the
reviewed studies the children’s version of the Wechsler
intelligence scale was used to avoid this. The test then
lacks age adjusted norms, but it gains a wider range in
scores, and therefore can monitor the cognitive decline
over a longer period of time. Studies differed also with
regard to the time period of observation, from 1 to

20 years. In studies with short follow-up periods, the
MMSE may not be a reliable measure, as Clark, Shep-
pard, Fillenbaum et al.  (1999) [36] have argued that
MMSE registrations need to be separated by at least
three years in order to be a reliable measure of cogni-
tive decline in AD.
Only few studies investigated, or reported, subgroups
with different cognitive profiles in DLB. It could be due
to a low number of cases in several studies, and subse-
quent low statistical power. People die from dementia or
reach an endpoint where they are not capable of per-
forming cognitive tests, and therefore in several studies
there was a lower number of patients towards the end of
the study. This is challenging when performing statistical
analysis. Our search did not cover the issue of subgroups 
with different cognitive profiles thoroughly, as we only
included studies comparing DLB with AD, and not stud-
ies describing cognitive decline in DLB and potential
subgroups alone. However, there are some data that sup-
port the hypothesis that there are subgroups in DLB
with different cognitive profiles, and subgroups with
poor initial visuospatial function may have a more rapid
decline than DLB with good visuospatial function [28].
Due to overlapping symptoms, it can be difficult to de-
termine the correct diagnosis ante mortem between the
pure form of AD, mixed AD/DLB and the pure form of
DLB. Because clinical criteria cannot distinguish with
certainty the individual pathology, the gold standard for
validating the clinical assessment is neuropathological
diagnosis. Clinical criteria may have a low sensitivity in
Page 12
Breitve et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy 2014, 6:53
http://alzres.com/content/6/5/53 
Page 12 of 13
particular for DLB, which could have been a source of
bias in studies that did not include a neuropathological
validation of the diagnosis. However, dementia is a clin-
ical diagnosis and both AD and DLB pathology can be
found also in cognitively normal elderly subjects. In one
study with autopsy, 50% of cases with widespread α-
synucleinopathy did not show any clinical signs of de-
mentia [37].
In most studies with autopsy, consensus neuropatho-
logical criteria were used. Even though not all included
studies used consistent and the same neuropathological
methods and criteria, and many also used varying com-
binations, use of post-mortem verification at least in-
creases the validity of the clinical diagnosis.
It is also important to mention that the sensitivity for
detecting Lewy bodies has increased with anti-ubiquitin
immunostaining, where tau-positive samples indicate
Alzheimer’s pathology. Anti-α-synuclein immunostain-
ing has been incorporated in the assessment, which is
most sensitive for Lewy body pathology [2].  Thus, the
neuropathological identification of cases may have been
less accurate before the new methods were established,
and more reliable staging strategies have been developed
[38].
A complicating issue is the frequent occurrence of
mixed pathology [39],  and to underline the complexity
of dementia and its pathology, at least four distinct
pathological phenotypes have been identified between
AD and DLB [40]. According to Schneider et al. (2012)
[7], the locus of neuropathology is associated with a fas-
ter decline in cognition. A neocortical type of Lewy body
pathology is associated with increased odds of dementia
and a faster decline in episodic, semantic and working
memory. The limbic-type is more associated with more
rapid decline in visuospatial function. Olichney et al.
(1998) [3], concluded that patients with Lewy body vari-
ant decline faster than patients with Alzheimer’s disease.
This statement has often been used with reference to
rapid progression in DLB, but it actually refers to an AD
variant with Lewy body pathology, not to pure DLB. It
should be emphasized that it is still uncertain whether
AD and DLB are two independent pathologies that may
coexist, or the pathologies are related, or one of them is
a consequence of the other.
Conclusion
Only 6 of the 18 included studies in this review found
some differences in cognitive decline between DLB and
AD over time, and only one of them found a faster de-
cline in DLB. It is difficult to draw firm conclusions
based on available studies, since the results are contradict-
ory. Future studies will need to apply recent diagnostic
criteria, as well as extensive diagnostic evaluation and aut-
opsy to confirm the diagnosis. Studies with large enough 
samples, adapted cognitive tests, more than one year of
follow up and multivariate statistical analysis are also
needed. Inclusion of mild cognitive impairment pa-
tients, with subclinical manifestations and an increased
risk of developing DLB (for example, who present rapid
eye-movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder) could also
strengthen the studies. Our final conclusion is that the
studies in this review support neither the hypothesis of
a faster cognitive decline in DLB, nor in AD.
