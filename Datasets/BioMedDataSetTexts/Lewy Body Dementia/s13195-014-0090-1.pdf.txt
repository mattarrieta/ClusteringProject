Abstract
Introduction: Depression and psychosis are two of the most severe neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia
with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Both NPS have negative effects on cognitive performance
and life expectancy. The current study aimed to investigate and compare monoaminergic etiologies between both
neurodegenerative conditions, given the lack of an efficient pharmacological treatment until present.
Methods: Eleven behaviorally relevant brain regions of the left frozen hemisphere of 10 neuropathologically confirmed
AD patients with/without depression (AD + D/-D; 5 were psychotic within AD + D), 10 confirmed DLB patients, all of
whom were depressed (DLB + D; 5 psychotic patients), and, finally, 10 confirmed control subjects were regionally
dissected. All patients were retrospectively assessed before death using the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease
Rating Scale (Behave-AD) and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia amongst others. The concentrations of dopamine
(DA), serotonin (5-HT), (nor)adrenaline and respective metabolites, i.e. 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and
homovanillic acid (HVA), 5-hydroxy-3-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), were
determined using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.
Results: DLB subjects had the overall lowest monoamine and metabolite concentrations regarding 33 out of 41
significant monoaminergic group alterations. Moreover, MHPG levels were significantly decreased in almost 8 out of 11
brain regions of DLB- compared to AD patients. We also observed the lowest 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels, and 5-HIAA/5-HT
turnover ratios in DLB + D compared to AD + D subjects. Additionally, a 4- and 7-fold increase of DOPAC/DA and HVA/
DA turnover ratios, and, a 10-fold decrease of thalamic DA levels in DLB + D compared to AD + D patients and control
subjects was noticed. Regarding psychosis, hippocampal DA levels in the overall DLB group significantly correlated with
Behave-AD AB scores. In the total AD group, DA levels and HVA/DA ratios in the amygdala significantly correlated with
Behave-AD AB scores instead.
Conclusions: Monoaminergic neurotransmitter alterations contribute differently to the pathophysiology of depression
and psychosis in DLB as opposed to AD, with a severely decreased serotonergic neurotransmission as the main
monoaminergic etiology of depression in DLB. Similarly, psychosis in DLB might, in part, be etiologically explained by
dopaminergic alterations in the hippocampus, whereas in AD, the amygdala might be involved.

Introduction
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most
common neurodegenerative disorder following Alzhei-
mer’s disease (AD) and accounts for up to 20% of all
autopsy-confirmed dementias in the elderly [1,2]. One of
the key hallmarks of DLB patients, besides the cognitive
impairment and parkinsonian symptomatology, is the
high frequency of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS),
particularly psychosis [3]. The presence of recurrent vis-
ual hallucinations has even been identified as one of the
core features in the clinical diagnosis of DLB. Addition-
ally, the supportive and suggestive diagnostic features
include depression, systematized delusions and rapid eye
movement (REM) sleep behavior disorders among others
[4].  Typically, visual hallucinations, delusions and de-
pression are much more common in DLB than in AD
[5,6]. The first two NPS occur in approximately 60% to
70% of DLB patients [5-7], whereas depression, although
frequently present in AD (28%),  remains much more
persistent in DLB (45%) after a follow-up period of one
year [8].  Moreover, depressive symptoms in AD and
DLB are associated with a greater cognitive decline [8]
and, in AD, significantly relate to lower survival rates
over a three-year period [9]. Psychosis in AD is also very
common and has previously been associated with an
increased mortality rate and, again, an accelerated cogni-
tive decline [10,11].  Besides depression and psychosis,
symptoms of anxiety, apathy and sleep disturbances
often coexist in DLB patients [3,12].  In addition, delu-
sions and hallucinations may trigger other NPS, such as
agitation or aggression, which regularly leads to early
nursing home admission [12].
At present, regarding the different classes of psycho-
active drug therapies to alleviate depression and psychosis
in AD, antipsychotics are the primary pharmacological
treatment option, although they may induce serious side
effects, increase mortality rates [13], and their efficacy is
‘modest’ at best [14]. The administration of psychotropic
medication has also been associated with a more rapid
cognitive and functional decline, and not necessarily with
improved NPS [15]. As for antidepressants, Pollock and
colleagues [16] reported that citalopram was superior to
placebo, with greatest efficacy for aggression, and, in a
later study [17], citalopram was found to be comparable
in efficacy to risperidone, differentiated by its significant
effect on agitation and its superior tolerability in the treat-
ment of moderate to severe NPS. Randomized controlled
trials of sertraline [18] and trazodone [19], however, have
been less promising. The pharmacological treatment of
NPS in DLB patients, on the other hand, requires an even
more cautious approach. For example, all drugs with anti-
cholinergic side effects, such as tricyclic antidepressants,
low potency neuroleptics, antiparkinsonian anticholinergic
drugs and antispasmodics for bladder or gastrointestinal 
tract, should be avoided due to their potential to exacer-
bate psychotic symptoms and, moreover, might induce
orthostatic hypotension [12].  Consequently, cholinomi-
metic therapy using cholinesterase inhibitors has proven
to be beneficial for apathy, anxiety and psychosis [20-22],
while two other studies found weak [23] or unclear [24]
evidence to support its use in DLB compared to Parkin-
son’s disease dementia (PDD).  Interestingly, concurrent
treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
(SSRI) and a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) 1A
receptor antagonist might offer a positive outcome to treat
depression efficiently in DLB, as was suggested by Francis
[25], although evidence for the benefits of antipsychotics
other than clozapine is limited, and there are serious
safety concerns about the use of antipsychotics in these
patients [3]. Finally, the administration of memantine, an
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, may
result in variable symptomatic side effects in DLB patients,
including worsening of psychosis or even an adverse drug
reaction [26,27].
While the neurobiological aspects of the parkinsonism
of DLB patients have been intensively studied, much less
attention has been paid to the pathophysiological mech-
anisms underlying depression and psychosis associated
with DLB. More specifically, very few studies have
attempted to delineate their neurochemical correlates
[25,28-31] and whether these are similar to or distinct
from AD [25]. Furthermore, given the lack of an efficient
psychotropic monoaminergic therapy, and due to the
fact that psychosis and depression are enormously
troublesome to caregivers and patients, cause an earlier
institutionalization and account for a significant increase
in the overall cost of dementia, it becomes essential to
intensely investigate the monoaminergic pathophysiology
of NPS features in DLB compared to AD. Likewise,
although recently a handful of studies have examined
the monoaminergic etiology of NPS in AD, as well as in
DLB and frontotemporal dementia, in postmortem
brain tissue [32] and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples
[33],  a neurochemical comparison study between DLB
and AD supplemented with the inclusion of an age- and
gender-matched control group would give more insight
into the monoaminergic characteristics of depression and
psychosis of both neurodegenerative disorders separately.
In the long term, such comparison studies may contribute
to the development of novel psychotropic pharmacother-
apies [3,34].
We, therefore, determined the levels of eight mono-
amines and metabolites, that is, the indolamine 5-HT,
the catecholamines dopamine (DA), adrenaline (A) and
noradrenaline (NA), as well as their respective metabo-
lites, that is, 5-hydroxy-3-indoleacetic acid (5-HIAA;
metabolite of the serotonergic neurotransmitter system),
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid and homovanillic acid

(DOPAC and HVA, respectively; metabolites of the dopa-
minergic neurotransmitter system) and 3-methoxy-4-
hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG; metabolite of the (nor)
adrenergic neurotransmitter system) in various post-
mortem brain regions of depressed and/or psychotic DLB
and AD patients using reversed-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection
(RP-HPLC-ECD) to identify monoaminergic neurotrans-
mitter alterations which may underlie both NPS. As a
baseline reference, tissue samples of the same brain
regions of a healthy control group were neurochemi-
cally analyzed as well.
Methods
Study population and inclusion protocol
Neuropathologically confirmed AD patients with (n = 10;
AD + D) and without (n = 10; AD-D) depression, 10
confirmed DLB patients, all of whom were depressed
(DLB + D) and, finally, 10 confirmed control subjects were
selected from the Biobank of the Institute Born-Bunge
(University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium). Initially, all
patients with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD and
DLB were recruited at the Memory Clinic of the Hospital
Network Antwerp (ZNA-Middelheim and ZNA-Hoge
Beuken, Antwerp, Belgium) for inclusion in a prospective,
longitudinal study on NPS [35]. As part of their differen-
tial diagnostic work-up of dementia, besides the general
physical and neurological examinations, blood screening
tests, structural neuroimaging by computed tomography
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or single photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT),  neuropsycho-
logical evaluations (for example, Mini-Mental State Exam-
ination (MMSE) scores) and optional cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF)/blood sampling for biomarker and/or DNA ana-
lyses, a baseline behavioral assessment was routinely
performed. If possible, AD and DLB patients were behav-
iorally rated again during follow-up. The clinical diagnosis
of probable AD was based on the NINCDS/ADRDA cri-
teria of McKhann et al.  [36,37] whereas probable DLB
was diagnosed according to the consensus guidelines
of McKeith et al. [4,38]. All patients also fulfilled the Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – IV –
text revision (DMS-IV-TR) criteria [39].  On the other
hand, age-matched control subjects were hospitalized in
the Middelheim General Hospital (Antwerp, Belgium) and
consented shortly before death. Death causes were cardiac
failure due to an acute myocardial infarct (n = 2), chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 3), carcinoma
(hepatic (n = 1); prostate (n = 1); lung (n = 1); neuroendo-
crine (n = 1)) and multiple myeloma (n = 1).  Moreover,
clinical neurological examination, as well as a retrospect-
ive review of the clinical history, neuropsychological
evaluation and hospital records, did not reveal any evi-
dence of dementia, psychiatric antecedents or cognitive 
decline. Written informed consent regarding autopsy and
the subsequent use of brain tissue, clinical documentation
and behavioral data for research purposes was obtained
from all participants. The study was also approved by the
Medical Ethical Committee of the Middelheim General
Hospital (Antwerp, Belgium) and conducted in compli-
ance with the Helsinki Declaration.
In case consented AD, DLB or control subjects died,
brain autopsy was performed within six hours after
death after which the left hemisphere was frozen at −80°C
for neurochemical analyses, and the right hemisphere was
formaldehyde-fixated for neuropathological examination.
The 10 AD + D and 10 AD-D patients were part of a
larger cohort of 40 behaviorally characterized AD patients
who were previously subjected to RP-HPLC-ECD assess-
ments [32]. However, the inclusion of DLB patients and
control subjects, as well as the inclusion of several extra
brain regions, render the current study significantly
distinct from our previous one [32], which had the same
methodological setup, but an entirely different hypothesis.
None of the included control subjects suffered from
central nervous system pathology.
Behavioral assessment
Behavior of AD and DLB patients was assessed together
with relatives and/or nursing staff using a battery of
behavioral assessment scales, including: the Behavioral
Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease Rating Scale (Behave-AD)
[40];  Middelheim Frontality Score (MFS) [41];  Cohen-
Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) [42];  and Cornell
Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) [43]. Dementia
staging was based on the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS)
with a range varying from 1 (nondemented) to 7 (terminal
stage of dementia) [44]. During each NPS assessment, only
the behavioral phenomena covering the last two weeks
prior to the assessment were included and rated. Behav-
ioral assessment was repeated during each neurological
follow-up examination in the hospital, if possible (n = 2
for AD + D, n = 3 for AD-D and n = 6 for DLB + D).  A
final retrospective behavioral scoring was performed in
case patients died more than ten days after the last follow-
up or baseline rating. In total, eight AD + D-, seven AD-
D- and four DLB + D patients underwent only one rating
close to death, given the short amount of time which was
left since they entered our study protocol. Nevertheless,
for this research purpose, only the final behavioral assess-
ment scores around the date of death were used so that
possible neurochemical alterations in the brain were as
representative as possible for the concurrent clinical mani-
festation of NPS in all dementia patients.
Patients with a total CSDD cutoff score ≥8 were classi-
fied as depressed, whereas patients with a CSDD score <8
were defined as non-depressed [45]. Furthermore, patients
with a Behave-AD cluster A score (delusions) ≥4 or a
Page 4
Vermeiren et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy (2015) 7:7  Page 4 of 18
Behave-AD cluster B score (hallucinations) ≥2 or patients
who were rated on the Behave-AD cluster A and B
subscales (delusions + hallucinations), irrespective of its
combined value, were classified as psychotic [46]. Finally,
based on their behavioral profiles, AD and DLB patients
were divided into three main groups, that is, AD + D
(n = 10, of which 5 were psychotic (AD + D + P),  AD-D
(n = 10, of which none were psychotic (AD-D-P)) and
DLB + D (n = 10, of which 5 were psychotic (DLB + D + P).
No behavioral scores were available for the control
group.
Neuropathological examination and criteria
In order to neuropathologically confirm or reject the clin-
ically established AD and DLB diagnoses, immunohisto-
chemistry on a standard selection of 10 to 13 regionally
dissected postmortem brain regions of the formaldehyde-
fixated right hemisphere was performed [47]. In short, the
stains routinely applied in our laboratory on paraffin
blocks of the neocortex (frontal, temporal and occipital),
amygdala, rhinencephalon (at the level of the posterior
part of the amygdala and the lateral geniculate body (for
hippocampus)), basal ganglia, thalamus, brain stem, sub-
stantia nigra (SN), pons at the level of the locus coeruleus
(LC) and cerebellum are hematoxylin-eosin (HE),  cresyl
violet and Bodian’s technique. The routinely applied
immunostains are 4G8 (amyloid), AT8 (P-tau181P
) and an
anti-ubiquitin antibody (ubiquitin). When the presence of
Lewy bodies (LB) is suspected on HE staining and ubiqui-
tin immunoreactivity, an additional anti-α-synuclein stain-
ing is applied.
Neuropathological assessments were established by the
same neuropathologist (JJM),  employing the criteria of
Braak and Braak [48], Braak et al. [49] and Jellinger and
Bancher [50] to decide on definite AD. The ‘ABC scoring’
method of Montine et al. [51] was applied to all AD brains
collected after May 2011 (n = 5). Similarly, the consensus
guidelines of McKeith et al.  [4,38] were used for the
neuropathological diagnosis of definite DLB. In case of
significant concurrent AD pathology (n = 8 out of 10
DLB patients),  the likelihood that the pathological
findings were associated with a DLB clinical syndrome
was assessed as recommended by McKeith et al.  [4],
resulting in a final decision of definite DLB with
limbic translational (n = 4; including n = 2 without AD
pathology) and diffuse neocortical (n = 6) Lewy body
subtype pathologies.
Regarding the control subjects, microscopic examin-
ation failed to detect significant degenerative changes in
any of the control brains, except for a limited cerebral
amyloid angiopathy, if present at all, and the sporadic
presence of some neurofibrillary (pre)tangles or diffuse
senile plaques, all of which were considered age-related. 
Regional brain dissection
Regional brain dissection of the left frozen hemisphere
was performed according to a standard procedure during
which 21 brain regions were routinely dissected. With re-
gard to this specific study design, a total of 11 behaviorally
and neurochemically relevant brain areas were ultimately
analyzed using RP-HPLC-ECD, that is, Brodmann area
(BA) 9 and BA10 (prefrontal cortex), BA11 (orbitofrontal
cortex), BA17 (occipital cortex), BA22 (temporal cortex),
BA24 (anterior cingulate gyrus), amygdala, hippocampus,
thalamus, cerebellar cortex and LC. All of these brain
regions have previously been the subject of other NPS-
related neurochemical research in depressed and/or
psychotic AD and DLB patients [25,28-31,52-56] and,
moreover, are also part of integrated behavior-modifying
brain circuits, such as the dopaminergic mesolimbic
system among others. In addition, this careful selection
comprises regions with clear-cut AD and DLB neuro-
pathological and -imaging hallmarks (for example, BA22,
hippocampus, prefrontal areas, thalamus and LC), as well
as brain regions in which these lesions are less present to
absent (BA17 and cerebellar cortex), but might still hold
significant neurochemical alterations.
Dissections were performed on a plastic cutting board
above a mixture of regular and dry ice by means of
scalpel, tweezers and a Dremel® 200 series rotary instru-
ment tool according to a standard procedure. During the
first part of this protocol, 15 of the 21 brain regions were
meticulously dissected as they were easily accessible, that
is, BA6/7/8/9/10/11/12/17/22/24/46, SN, cerebellar cor-
tex, medulla oblongata and LC. Afterwards, the remaining
left hemisphere was placed at −20°C for four hours after
which seven to eight coronal slices were cut. Subse-
quently, the remaining six brain regions were dissected,
namely amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate nu-
cleus, putamen and globus pallidus. All dissected brain
tissue samples roughly weighed 300 to 500 mg and were
immediately stored on dry ice in precooled aluminum
cryovials (Sanbio BV, Uden, The Netherlands) during the
dissection. In total, each dissected brain region could be
subdivided into four of these cryovials of which three were
used for HPLC analyses. The fourth one was used for pH
measurement if necessary.
All AD, DLB and control brain hemispheres were
dissected by the same researcher to minimize variability.
Neurochemical RP-HPLC-ECD analysis
A recently optimized and validated RP-HPLC system with
electrochemical detection (ECD) for the fast detection
of monoaminergic compounds in human brain tissue
was used to simultaneously measure the concentrations
of 5-HT, DA, (N)A and their respective metabolites,
that is, 5-HIAA, DOPAC/HVA and MHPG [57]. Sam-
ple analysis was performed using an AlexysTM Dual
Page 5
Vermeiren et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy (2015) 7:7  Page 5 of 18
Monoamines Analyzer (Antec Leyden BV, Zoeterwoude,
The Netherlands) by which each brain tissue sample was
directly analyzed in duplicate. Output ranges were 500
pA and 2 nA, respectively, with two electrochemical
VT03 flow cells each containing a glassy carbon working
electrode of 0.7 mm and an in situ Ag/AgCl reference
electrode at 670 mV placed in a Decade II electro-
chemical detector (Antec Leyden BV, Zoeterwoude, The
Netherlands). An isocratic flow rate of 40 μL of mobile
phase per minute was set for both LC 110 pumps. The
optimal conditions for separation of the monoaminergic
compounds were obtained using a mobile phase compris-
ing 13% methanol combined with a mixture of phosphoric
(50 mM) and citric acid (50 mM), octane-1-sulfonic acid
sodium salt (1.8 mM), KCl (8 mM) and ethylenediamine-
tetraacetic acid (EDTA) (0.1 mM) (pH 3.6). Samples were
loaded onto two microbore ALF-125 columns (250 mm ×
1.0 mm, 3 μm particle size) filled with a porous C18 silica
stationary phase by an AlexysTM AS 100 Autosampler
(Antec Leyden BV, Zoeterwoude, The Netherlands).
Separation of the monoamines and metabolites was
achieved at a stable column and VT03 flow cell temp-
erature of 36°C with a total runtime of only 45 minutes
per sample. Levels of the monoaminergic compounds
were calculated using ClarityTM Software (DataApex Ltd,
2008, Prague, The Czech Republic). All chemicals were of
analytical grade.
The brain sample preparation procedure prior to RP-
HPLC-ECD analysis was simple and fast. Initially, 200 to
300 mg frozen brain tissue was weighed in 4 ml mobile
phase. Next, this mixture was homogenized for 40 seconds
(50 seconds in case samples that weighed ≥250 mg) at
moderate speed using an Ultra-Turrax TR 50 homogenizer®
(Janke & Kunkel, Ika-Werk, Staufen, Germany). The hom-
ogenate was then centrifuged (26,000 × g, 20 minutes, 4°C)
and afterwards, the supernatant was filtered using a 0.2 μm
Millipore® filter (Millex, Merck Millipore, Carrigtwohill,
County Cork, Ireland) attached to a syringe. Further
elimination of proteins was accomplished using 10 kDa
Amicon® Ultra Centrifugal Filters (Millipore) (14,000 × g,
20 minutes, 4°C) which were washed twice beforehand
with mobile phase. The final filtrate was then loaded onto
the HPLC columns (undiluted and diluted).
pH measurement of cerebellar brain tissue
Samples needed to be nonacidotic (that is, pH >6.1) [58,59]
in order to guarantee high-quality brain tissue since acid-
osis may induce alterations in neurotransmitter and neuro-
peptide concentrations, as well as enzyme activity. Several
factors such as a prolonged death struggle, premortem
stroke and a long postmortem delay could acidify brain tis-
sue [60,61]. In this study, pH values of the cerebellar cortex
were measured since the cerebellar pH has previously been
shown to be most representative for the entire brain [61]. 
First, a 0.01 N NaOH-solution was prepared to adjust
the pH of deionized water to 7.0. Next, approximately
100 mg of frozen cerebellar cortex was weighed after
which 1 ml of the adjusted water was added. The mixture
was then homogenized with a Pro-200 Homogenizer (Pro
Scientific, Oxford, CT, USA) for 30 seconds at moderate
speed at 4°C. Finally, the homogenate was centrifuged
(8,000 × g, 10 minutes, 4°C) and the pH of the super-
natant was measured. Per patient, two cerebellar samples
were included.
At the end, all brain regions with acidotic pH values
(<6.1) were excluded from data analysis.
Statistical analysis
Nonparametric statistics were applied due to the limited
number of patients, ordinal variables (behavioral scores)
and not normally distributed data after performing a
Shapiro-Wilk test of normality.
Chi-square statistics were applied to compare male/
female ratios and patients taking/not taking psychotropic
medication across groups. Kruskal-Wallis analyses with
post-hoc Mann-Whitney U tests were used for comparison
of all behavioral, neurocognitive, demographic, pH and
monoaminergic data between AD + D, AD-D, DLB + D
and control subjects, as well as the monoaminergic data
between AD + D + P, AD + D-P, DLB + D + P and DLB +
D-P. In all cases, only data remaining statistically sig-
nificant following a Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparisons (P <0.017 for three group comparisons
(Table 1) and P <0.0083 for six group comparisons (Tables 2
and 3)) were regarded as significant. Mann–Whitney U
tests were used to look at potential confounding effects of
psychotropic medication, with regard to our neurochemical
data, between patients taking and not taking psychotropic
medication within each group. Finally, in order to calculate
neurochemical correlations of CSDD-, Behave-AD cluster
A/B/A + B- and other behavioral scores in the total AD
(n = 20) and DLB (n = 10) populations, nonparametric
Spearman’s Rank-Order correlation statistics were applied.
Again, a Bonferroni correction was performed, and only
those significant data were taken into account (Table 4;
P <0.0033). All analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0
for Windows (IBM SPSS Software, Armonk, NY, USA,
IBM Corp.). Figures were generated using GraphPad Prism
6.0 software.

comparable between groups as well. The different types
of administered psychotropic medication were cholino-
mimetics (n = 1 for AD + D; n = 2 for AD-D; n = 3 for
DLB + D), prolopa/levodopa (n = 3 for DLB + D), antide-
pressants (n = 4 for AD + D; n = 1 for AD-D; n = 3 for
DLB + D; n = 2 for controls),  hypnotics/sedatives/anxio-
lytics (n = 1 for AD + D and DLB + D; n = 2 for AD-D;
n = 3 for controls) and antipsychotics (n = 4 for AD + D
and AD-D; n = 2 for DLB + D). The average number of
days between the last behavioral assessment and date of
death was 3.8, 3.9 and 5.2 days for the AD + D, AD-D
and DLB + D groups, respectively. Furthermore, MMSE
scores of the DLB + D group were significantly lower
than those of the AD-D group (P = 0.013), who had the
overall highest MMSE scores. Finally, GDS scores and
pH values were comparable between groups with, in
total, one AD + D and one AD-D patient who had low
cerebellar pH values (<6.1). For these patients, extra pH
analyses on the ten remaining brain regions were
performed. Eventually, brain samples with acidotic pH
values were excluded from statistical analysis, that is, for
BA9 (n = 1), BA11 (n = 1), BA17 (n = 1), amygdala (n = 1)
and cerebellum (n = 2).
Behavioral assessment scores
The behavioral assessment scores of each group are
presented in Table 1.
The MFS total scores (P = 0.004),  Behave-AD total
scores (P = 0.005),  Behave-AD global scores (P = 0.004),
CMAI cluster 2 scores (P = 0.015) and CSDD total scores
(P = 0.00001) were significantly higher in the AD + D
group compared to the AD-D group, whereas the Behave-
AD cluster B scores (P = 0.013),  Behave-AD cluster AB
scores (P = 0.013) and CSDD total scores (P = 0.00001)
were all significantly lower in the AD-D group compared
to the DLB + D group.
Focus depression: neurochemical comparison of brain
monoamines, metabolites and ratios between AD + D,
AD-D, DLB + D and control subjects
Only the neurochemical group differences which remained
statistically significant following Bonferroni correction are 
displayed in Table 2 (P <0.00833). Nonsignificant data were
omitted.
The DLB + D group had the overall lowest monoamine
and metabolite levels, as well as ratios. More specifically,
the DLB + D group had the significantly lowest values
for 33 out of 41 monoaminergic group alterations
(rows),  across 11 brain regions, compared to AD + D,
AD-D and/or control subjects (Table 2). In addition, the
DLB + D group had the significantly highest DOPAC/DA
and HVA/DA ratios, indicative of dopaminergic turn-
over, specifically for hippocampus (only DOPAC/DA),
thalamus (both), and cerebellum (only DOPAC/DA), as
well as the highest MHPG/NA ratios, indicative of nor-
adrenergic catabolism, in the LC. The control group had
the lowest, second lowest and highest values for 5, 18
and 7 out of 41 significant monoaminergic group differ-
ences, respectively. As for the AD + D/-D groups, levels
varied, but, in general, they had the highest concentra-
tions for 29 rows out of the total of 41.
The most statistically significant alterations were
noticeable in the thalamus, with significantly lower DA
levels and, at the same time, significantly increased
DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA ratios in the DLB + D popu-
lation compared to the AD + D (P = 0.00008, 0.002 and
0.007, respectively), AD-D (P = 0.0003, 0.002 and 0.007,
respectively) and control group (P = 0.00008, 0.0003 and
0.004, respectively). Thalamic NA levels were also signifi-
cantly decreased (P = 0.003, 0.001 and 0.0005, respect-
ively),  whereas thalamic MHPG levels of the DLB + D
group were only significantly lower when compared to the
AD + D population (P = 0.0002). Similarly, 5-HT levels of
BA9, BA10 and BA24, as well as 5-HIAA levels of BA10,
BA17, BA22 and BA24 were significantly lower in DLB +
D patients compared to their AD + D (for 5-HT: P = 0.001,
0.00001 and 0.0005; for 5-HIAA: P = 0.003, 0.00008,
0.0004 and 0.007, respectively) and AD-D (for 5-HT:
P = 0.00008, 0.00008 and 0.0003; for 5-HIAA: P = 0.029,
0.002, 0.001 and 0.007, respectively) counterparts. The
hippocampal 5-HIAA/5-HT ratios, indicative of serotoner-
gic catabolism, were significantly decreased in DLB + D
patients compared to AD + D patients as well (P = 0.003).
Furthermore, in the LC, DOPAC, DA and HVA levels of
the DLB + D population were significantly decreased

respectively) and control group (P = 0.0001, 0.002 and
0.00001, respectively) (Table 2).
Finally, DA levels of BA17 were significantly increased
in AD + D patients compared to AD-D patients and the
control group (P = 0.003 and 0.006, respectively), whereas
5-HT levels of BA9 were significantly higher in AD-D
patients compared to the control subjects (P = 0.007).
MHPG levels across different postmortem brain regions in
DLB versus AD and controls
Remarkably, MHPG was significantly decreased in seven
out of eleven postmortem brain regions of DLB subjects
compared to AD + D and/or AD-D patients, that is, BA9
(P = 0.004 compared to AD-D),  BA10 (P = 0.04 and 
0.008 compared to AD + D and AD-D, respectively),
amygdala (P = 0.007 compared to AD + D), hippocampus
(P = 0.023 compared to AD + D), thalamus (P = 0.0002 and
0.013 compared to AD + D and AD-D, respectively), BA11
(P = 0.028 compared to AD-D) and BA22 (P = 0.0004
and 0.041 compared to AD + D and AD-D, respectively)
(Figure 1). As for BA24, MHPG levels were almost signifi-
cantly lower in DLB patients compared to both AD + D
and AD-D subjects (borderline significance; P = 0.059
for both). Surprisingly, in BA17, DLB patients as well as
control subjects had significantly higher MHPG levels
compared to their AD + D counterparts (P = 0.011 for
both).  In total, for five out of seven brain regions in
which statistically different MHPG levels were found
(P <0.05), these differences remained significant following

For the cerebellar cortex and the LC, no MHPG differ-

except for NA levels and MHPG/NA ratios in the LC
of DLB patients, which were respectively significantly
decreased and increased compared to both AD + D and
AD-D patients (for AD + D: P = 0.041 for both; for AD-D:
P = 0.018 and 0.007 (Table 2)).
Besides the DLB-AD comparison, MHPG concentrations
were significantly increased in the AD + D and/or AD-D
group(s) compared to the control group as well, that is, for
BA9 (P = 0.049 compared to AD-D),  BA10 (P = 0.04 and
0.01 compared to AD + D and AD-D, respectively), BA24
(P = 0.03 and 0.049 compared to AD + D and AD-D,
respectively),  amygdala (P = 0.027 compared to AD + D),
hippocampus (P = 0.027 compared to AD + D) and thal-
amus (P = 0.016 compared to AD + D).  As for BA17,
MHPG levels of the control group were significantly in-
creased compared to the AD + D group (P = 0.011). Finally,
in BA11, BA22 and cerebellar cortex, we also noticed 
significantly lower MHPG levels in DLB patients compared
to control subjects (P = 0.007, 0.011 and 0.023, respectively)
(Figure 1).

Brain monoaminergic correlates of NPS features in the
DLB and AD population
Table 4 shows the significant brain monoaminergic
correlates of NPS in the DLB and total AD group, only
for those that remained significant following Bonferroni
correction. Both AD subgroups were joined into one
total AD group (n = 20) in order to obtain a heteroge-
neous cohort with a better distribution of NPS scores
since AD + D patients had much higher behavioral scores
compared to AD-D patients (Table 1). Furthermore, there
were no significant brain monoamine differences between
AD + D and AD-D subjects, except of DA levels in 
BA17 (Table 2). The merging also resulted in increased
statistical power. The four most significant correlations
are described below.
In the DLB group, hippocampal DA levels strongly
correlated with Behave-AD cluster AB scores (psychosis)
(P = 0.0001, R = +0.928, n = 10; Figure 2B).
In the total AD population, HVA/DA ratios of the
amygdala strongly correlated with Behave-AD cluster
AB scores (psychosis) (P = 0.0003, R = +0.766, n = 17;
Figure 2C) and CMAI cluster 3 scores (verbal agitation)
(P = 0.0002, R = +0.786, n = 17; Figure 2A), whereas DA
levels of the amygdala inversely correlated with Behave-
AD cluster AB scores (psychosis) (P = 0.0009, R = −0.728,
n = 17; Figure 2D).  Noteworthy, MHPG/NA ratios of
the LC significantly correlated with Behave-AD cluster
D scores (agitation/aggression) in the total AD group
as well (P = 0.001, R = +0.728, n = 16),  although statis-
tical significance was not maintained after Bonferroni
correction.

Potential confounding monoaminergic effects of
administered psychotropic medication
In the AD + D group, HVA levels of the amygdala (727.8
versus 537.0 ng/ml; P = 0.016),  MHPG levels of BA17
(164.6 versus 119.6 ng/ml; P = 0.016) and MHPG (669.9
versus 531.4 ng/ml; P = 0.029) and HVA levels of the LC
(1,690.0 versus 963.2 ng/ml; P = 0.029) were significantly
higher in patients who were administered psychotropic
medication before death (n = 4),  compared to patients
free of such medication (n = 5). In AD-D patients, only
HVA/5-HIAA ratios of BA17 were revealed to be signifi-
cantly lower in those patients who took psychotropic
medication (n = 7) compared to their medication-free
counterparts (n = 3) (0.259 versus 0.541; P = 0.017). With
regard to the control subjects, only MHPG levels of
BA22 were significantly increased in takers (n = 5) versus
non-takers (n = 5) (1,484.0 versus 428.7 ng/ml; P = 0.032)
and finally, in the DLB + D group, 5-HT levels of BA17
were significantly lower (2.443 versus 4.822 ng/ml;
P = 0.038), whereas HVA levels of the cerebellar cortex
(51.7 versus 20.8 ng/ml; P = 0.019) as well as the HVA/
5-HIAA ratios of BA9 (1.408 versus 0.459; P = 0.038),
BA11 (0.839 versus 0.378; P = 0.01) and BA24 (0.685
versus 0.325; P = 0.01) were all significantly higher in
patients on psychotropic medication (n = 6) compared
to patients free of such drugs (n = 4).
Discussion
Study strengths and weaknesses
Following our study protocol which allows no more than
six hours between death and brain storage at −80°C, an
average postmortem delay of approximately three to four
hours was accomplished for each group. Besides this
short time interval, additional pH measurements as a
second quality control measure also ensured us of non-
acidotic and high quality brain tissue samples. All groups
were age- and gender-matched, with similar storage
times of the frozen brain tissue samples and a low num-
ber of days between the last behavioral assessment and
date of death (Table 1; see Results).  Moreover, all the
paraformaldehyde-fixated right brain hemispheres were
always neuropathologically examined by the same neuro-
pathologist and, in addition, regional brain dissections of
the left frozen hemispheres were also carried out by the
same scientist, which, respectively, minimized the diag-
nostic and inter-dissection variability. Our optimized
RP-HPLC-ECD method was reliable, fast, robust and
sensitive for the simultaneous determination of eight
monoamines and metabolites with a low detection limit,
high repeatability and recovery, short runtime, measure-
ments in duplicate, short and simple sample preparation
procedure and relatively high throughput. All analyses
and sample preparation procedures were accurately 
performed by the same two scientists, which resulted in
a low inter-assay variability.
With regard to the study weaknesses, each group con-
sisted of a relatively small number of patients, although
each patient was clinically, behaviorally and neuropatho-
logically well characterized and nonparametric statistics
were applied. Unfortunately, no behavioral ratings were
available for the control subjects, although their clinical
records did not demonstrate any evidence of psychiatric
antecedents or depression. The absence of a non-
depressed DLB group for neurochemical and statistical
group comparisons might also be regarded as a study
weakness. Furthermore, the administration of psycho-
tropic medication before death might have camouflaged
certain NPS and might also have altered the brain’s
monoamine levels and -receptors. Our neurochemical
data thus might have been influenced, since the neuro-
chemical effects may last up to several weeks after the
last administration. In order to address this weakness,
we applied a total Bonferroni correction to all statistical
analyses and compared the brain monoamine levels
between patients taking and not taking psychotropic
medication in each group. Accordingly, these analyses
showed that all of the highly significant aforementioned
brain monoamine differences between the groups were
most likely not influenced by psychotropic drugs, except
HVA levels in the LC of AD + D patients and 5-HT and
HVA levels in BA17 and the cerebellum, respectively, of
DLB + D patients. These specific monoamines were sig-
nificantly altered in AD + D and DLB + D patients who
were on psychotropic medication (see Results),  which
might have caused these same monoamines to become
significantly altered in the AD + D/DLB + D comparison
(Table 2). Lastly, the concurrent AD pathology in eight
of ten neuropathologically confirmed DLB patients
might also form a limitation of this study, although the
co-occurrence of AD and DLB is very common. More
specifically, the neuropathological overlap between both
neurodegenerative conditions is so extensive that ‘pure’
DLB, that is, without any AD-related pathology beyond
that attributable to normal aging, is relatively uncommon,
accounting for merely one third of all cases of Lewy body
dementia and perhaps 4% of all dementia cases [64].
The serotonergic neuropathophysiology of depression in
DLB compared to AD
Our results indicate that the serotonergic neurotrans-
mission in the prefrontal, temporal, limbic and even oc-
cipital cortex as well as hippocampus might be severely
impaired in DLB patients who suffered from depression.
More specifically, we observed the lowest 5-HT and 5-
HIAA levels as well as 5-HIAA/5-HT turnover ratios in
eight of eleven brain regions of DLB + D patients com-
pared to AD + D patients.

In general, LB accumulate in the dorsal raphe nucleus,
which is the largest serotonergic nucleus in the human
brain and provides a substantial proportion of the sero-
tonergic innervation to the forebrain [65], resulting in a
marked reduction of 5-HT levels in the striatum, neo-
cortex and frontal cortex of DLB patients [25].  Ballard
and colleagues [3] also adduced that the pathophysiology
of depression in DLB, as well as PDD, is fundamentally
different from that seen in AD, with alterations within
the serotonergic pathway as a common feature of both.
A previous study that investigated the theory of an im-
paired serotonergic neurotransmission in DLB patients
with a major depressive disorder, observed an increased
expression of 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) reuptake sites
in BA7, the parietal neocortex, compared to those with-
out depression [66].  On the other hand, in depressed
AD patients, 5-HTT reuptake sites of the temporal cor-
tex were reported to be significantly reduced compared
to their nondepressed counterparts [67]. The depressed
and nondepressed DLB groups of Ballard et al.  [66]
apparently also had lower mean 5-HTT reuptake site
binding values than controls [unpublished observations;
[25]]. The latter is comparable with our own serotoner-
gic data, with significantly lower 5-HT and/or 5-HIAA
levels in BA10, BA11, BA22, BA17 and cerebellum of
DLB + D patients compared to healthy controls. In other
studies of Sharp et al., higher 5-HT1A 
receptor binding
densities were examined in postmortem brain tissue
samples of the frontal cortex and BA36 in DLB patients
compared to healthy controls (for the frontal cortex)
[52] and in a subgroup of DLB + D subjects compared to
DLB-D patients (for BA36) [28].
Based upon these recent findings, it seems plausible that
in response to the severely damaged and degenerated
raphe nuclei, a selective postsynaptic 5-HT1A 
receptor
upregulation and relative preservation of the 5-HTT re-
uptake sites might be triggered, specifically in depressed
DLB patients, to compensate for the decreased serotoner-
gic neurotransmission from these nuclei towards their
neocortical and limbic projection areas [3,25].
Thalamic dopaminergic dysfunctioning and depression in
DLB compared to AD
Besides the serotonergic brain differences, our monoam-
inergic data also point to a decreased dopaminergic
neurotransmission with four- and seven-fold increases of
DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA turnover ratios and a ten-fold
decrease of DA levels in the thalamus of DLB + D com-
pared to AD + D patients and control subjects. These find-
ings in the thalamus might be attributed to the loss of DA
producing neurons in the SN, one of the neuropathological
hallmarks in DLB, although a significant reduction of
nigro-thalamic and -striatal DA levels may also mediate
some of the non-motor symptoms [29], such as depression. 
With regard to apathy, for example, David and colleagues
[30] studied the relationship between apathy and striatal
DA transporter (DAT) uptake in AD (n = 14) and DLB
(n = 8) subjects by means of 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT imaging.
The authors concluded that, using the Apathy Inventory,
lack of initiative inversely correlated with bilateral puta-
men DAT uptake in the overall population of 22 patients.
Although no statistical comparative analysis of the DAT
binding potential (BP) values between DLB and AD was
performed, their data clearly indicated that the subgroup
of DLB subjects with apathy (n = 6; scores of 9 to 12) had
much lower DAT BP values in left and right putamen than
their apathetic AD counterparts (n = 3; scores of 9 to 12).
On the other hand, increased thalamic D2 receptor dens-
ities in 18 DLB patients compared to 14 elderly controls
have been reported as well [29], although the authors did
not determine thalamic DA levels nor classify their DLB
population into depressed/nondepressed study patients.
Interestingly, Wilson et al. [68] also noticed a strong
association between the LB density in the LC, dorsal
raphe nucleus as well as SN, and the degree of depressive
symptoms in 124 older nondemented individuals. On the
contrary, neurofibrillary tangle density within the same
nuclei was not significantly related to depressive symptoms.
Again, these results underline the prominent place of
depression in synucleinopathies, such as DLB, and evidence
the putative link between depression, LB and altered sero-
tonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems.
Psychosis and its dopaminergic pathogenesis in DLB
versus AD
Based upon our findings, we suggest that psychosis in AD
might be pathophysiologically associated with a decreased
dopaminergic neurotransmission solely restricted to the
amygdala, whereas an impaired and rather increased
dopaminergic activity across the mesolimbic system and
LC might clinically account for psychosis in DLB.
The pathogenic link between altered dopaminergic
pathways and psychosis in DLB has not been intensively
investigated before. The most intriguing evidence comes
from Roselli et al.  [31],  who observed an association
between decreased striatal DAT levels, measured by 123I-
FP-CIT-SPECT imaging, and the presence of visual halluci-
nations in 18 DLB patients. When the authors considered
the putamen and caudate nucleus separately, delusions,
apathy and depression were inversely correlated with
decreased caudate DAT levels also. The ratios of specific
to nonspecific binding of 123I-FP-CIT, a DAT-specific
radiotracer, were calculated as size-weighted averages of
right, as well as left, brain activities. Similarly, our research
group previously examined an inverse correlation between
CSF HVA levels and hallucinations in a group of 26 DLB
patients [33].  Overall, given the significantly impaired
serotonergic neurotransmission in DLB brain [25],  it is
Page 15
Vermeiren et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy (2015) 7:7  Page 15 of 18
conceivable that the functional coupling between the sero-
tonergic and dopaminergic pathways, with an inhibitory
output of the serotonergic on the dopaminergic neuro-
transmission [62,63], could be severely impaired, possibly
leading to increased HVA and DA levels. Such a disrup-
tion of a functionally coupled system might explain the
overall serotonergic and dopaminergic differences which
are summarized in Table 3. With regard to dopaminergic
medications, to date, no randomized controlled trials have
been performed to evaluate the use of levodopa to relieve
psychosis in DLB, given the known side effects and the
potential risk of worsening hallucinations and sleep distur-
bances [3]. For the same reasons, only a limited number
of studies have investigated the use of antipsychotics in
DLB patients, with one study reporting partial or complete
amelioration of psychosis in 90% of participants after the
administration of quetiapine [69], with only mild worsen-
ing in 27% of the cases of parkinsonian symptoms, while
another one showed diminution of delusions and halluci-
nations after treatment with olanzapine [70].
Lastly, we need to bear in mind that the pathogenesis
of psychosis in DLB is mainly related to right, and not
left, hemispheric abnormalities, something which has been
postulated after various SPECT and PET-related imaging
studies [53,71,72]. Nonetheless, a left hemispheric hypo-
perfusion in the hippocampus, insula, ventral striatum
and prefrontal, parietal and occipital cortices has also been
previously linked with the presence of delusions and visual
hallucinations in DLB [53].
Brain MHPG levels are significantly reduced in DLB as
opposed to AD
DLB + D patients had significantly decreased brain
MHPG levels compared to the AD + D and/or AD-D
group(s) in almost eight of eleven brain regions. The most
remarkable decrease was noticed in BA9 and BA10, BA22
and especially thalamus. Surprisingly, in BA17, MHPG
levels were significantly increased in contrast with AD
patients (Figure 1).
Reduced NA concentrations in the putamen, as well as
frontal, temporal and occipital cortices of DLB patients
compared to AD and control subjects have been previ-
ously observed by Ohara et al. [54], although no MHPG
levels were measured and only five patients per group
were included. Accordingly, MHPG and NA levels
across the cortex of AD subjects have been reported to
be significantly increased and decreased, respectively,
compared to control values [55].  However, the only
study that comes close in comparing brain MHPG levels
between DLB and AD patients, is that from Langlais
et al. [56], in which lower MHPG and NA levels in the
caudate nucleus, putamen and BA8 (frontal cortex) of
LB variant AD cases compared to ‘pure’ AD cases and
control subjects were observed. 
The importance of MHPG in DLB as opposed to AD
has been emphasized before by Herbert et al. [73], who
confirmed that the addition of MHPG to CSF amyloid
beta1–42 
(Aβ1–42
), total- and phosphorylated tau protein
improves the discrimination of DLB from AD but not
from vascular dementia. These authors also measured
CSF levels of MHPG, HVA and 5-HIAA and found that
not only MHPG, but also HVA, as well as 5-HIAA were
significantly lower in DLB compared to AD patients,
which is very similar to our results (Table 2) [74]. Given
the neuropathological hallmark of substantial LC neuro-
degeneration in DLB [75], our results underpin the hy-
pothesis that MHPG might indeed have an important
added biomarker value to effectively distinguish between
both neurodegenerative conditions. Noteworthy, in our
study, MHPG levels in the LC did not significantly differ,
although NA levels and MHPG/NA ratios were signifi-
cantly decreased and increased, respectively, in DLB
compared to both AD subgroups. Results possibly dem-
onstrate that the presence of LB in addition to plaques
and tangles might further affect the noradrenergic
neurotransmission in the LC. Moreover, in AD, compen-
satory noradrenergic changes in response to the signifi-
cant noradrenergic cell body loss in the LC have been
suggested [75]. Overall, both counteracting pathophysio-
logical processes may have resulted in seemingly unaltered
MHPG levels.
Finally, the surprisingly higher MHPG levels in BA17
of DLB versus AD patients may be indicative of certain
distinct monoaminergic neurotransmitter alterations in
the visual association cortex. Functional deficits of such
a distinguishable cerebral network have been linked to
the presence of psychosis in DLB before [53,76]. How-
ever, this assumption necessitates further investigation,
certainly regarding its monoaminergic etiology.
Conclusions
By and large, we conclude that monoaminergic neuro-
transmitter alterations contribute differently to the neuro-
chemical pathophysiology of depression and psychosis
in DLB compared to AD. More specifically, our results
support the hypothesis of a dysfunctional, decreased sero-
tonergic neurotransmission as the main monoaminergic
etiology of depression in DLB. The serotonergic pathways
could potentially be even more impaired in DLB + D com-
pared to those in AD + D, although the 5-HT deficiency
theory may serve as a common feature of both. Moreover,
given the generally decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels, as
well as 5-HIAA/5-HT turnover ratios, measured in our
study, combined with the formerly suggested counteract-
ing mechanisms of upregulated postsynaptic 5-HT1A 
re-
ceptors and relatively preserved 5-HTT reuptake sites, a
concurrent pharmacological treatment using an SSRI and
a 5-HT1A 
receptor antagonist might indeed effectively
Page 16
Vermeiren et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy (2015) 7:7  Page 16 of 18
alleviate depressive symptoms in DLB patients [25]. Cor-
respondingly, we point at a severely impaired thalamic
dopaminergic neurotransmission which, supplemented
with a deficient nigrostriatal dopaminergic innervation,
might mediate non-parkinsonian symptoms, such as de-
pression, in DLB as well. Furthermore, we suggest that a
generally increased dopaminergic neurotransmitter activ-
ity in the prefrontal, temporal and mesolimbic cortices as
well as LC and hippocampus could closely relate to psych-
osis in DLB. On the contrary, in AD, a decreased dopa-
minergic neurotransmission and increased dopaminergic
catabolism, specifically in the amgydala, might function as
a monoaminergic substrate of psychosis. The complexity
of an altered coupling between serotonergic and dopamin-
ergic pathways might, additionally, also account differently
for the presence of psychosis in DLB compared to that in
AD. On the whole, evidence is accumulating that future
pharmacological treatments may target both serotonergic
and dopaminergic systems to reduce these specific NPS.
Finally, significantly lower MHPG levels across the brain,
with the exception of BA17, in DLB compared to AD pa-
tients empathically stress its added CSF biomarker value
to the traditional Aβ1–42 
and tau proteins, as was postu-
lated before [73].
As for future studies, the functional importance of the
basal ganglia and nigrostriatal pathways in non-motor
symptoms in DLB necessitate further examination, given
their monoaminergic relationship with depression, among
others. For example, a neurochemical analysis of the entire
neostriatum, subthalamic nucleus, SN, thalamus, midbrain
and cerebral cortex might create a better perspective
on certain dysfunctional monoaminergic patterns which
could contribute to NPS in DLB. With regard to psychosis
in particular, inclusion of the right hemisphere is advised.
Likewise, the relationship between NPS and acetylcholi-
nergic neurotransmitter abnormalities in DLB as opposed
to AD needs to be scrutinized as well.
