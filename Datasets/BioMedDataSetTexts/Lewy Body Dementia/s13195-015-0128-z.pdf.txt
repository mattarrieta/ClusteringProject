Comprehensive treatment of dementia with
Lewy bodies

Abstract
Dementia with Lewy bodies is an under-recognized disease; it is responsible for up to 20 % of all dementia cases.
Accurate diagnosis is essential because the management of dementia with Lewy bodies is more complex than many
neurodegenerative diseases. This is because alpha-synuclein, the pathological protein responsible for dementia with
Lewy bodies (and Parkinson’s disease), produces symptoms in multiple domains. By dividing the symptoms into
cognitive, neuropsychiatric, movement, autonomic, and sleep categories, a comprehensive treatment strategy can be
achieved. Management decisions are complex, since the treatment of one set of symptoms can cause complications in
other symptom domains. Nevertheless, a comprehensive treatment program can greatly improve the patient’s quality
of life, but does not alter the progression of disease. Cholinesterase inhibitors are effective for cognitive and
neuropsychiatric symptoms; rivastigmine has the widest evidence base. Special care needs to be taken to avoid
potentially fatal idiopathic reactions to neuroleptic medications; these should be used for short periods only when
absolutely necessary and when alternative treatments have failed. Pimavanserin, a selective serotonin 5-HT2A inverse
agonist, holds promise as an alternative therapy for synuclein-associated psychosis. Levodopa/carbidopa treatment of
parkinsonism is often limited by dopa-induced exacerbations of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms. Autonomic
symptoms are under-recognized complications of synucleinopathy. Constipation, urinary symptoms and postural
hypotension respond to standard medications. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is highly specific (98 %)
to the synucleinopathies. Nonpharmacological treatments, melatonin and clonazepam are all effective.
Introduction
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is an under-recognized
disease. The diagnostic criteria have low sensitivity (12 to
32 %) and high specificity (>95 %) [1], so many cases are
not diagnosed. Therefore, meta-analytic studies suggesting
that DLB accounts for 4 % of dementia diagnoses [2]
underestimate the true prevalence [3],  which may be
closer to 20 % of dementia [4, 5]. Parkinson’s disease de-
mentia (PDD) accounts for a further 3 to 5 % of dementia
cases [5, 6]. Both DLB and PDD are due to the patho-
logical accumulation of alpha-synuclein, but patients with
parkinsonism for 1 year prior to cognitive decline are clas-
sified as PDD [4]. Cognitive decline and parkinsonism are
insidious, so the distinction can be difficult to draw and
may be influenced by the subspecialty interest of the diag-
nosing neurologist (for example, movement disorder ver-
sus behavioral neurology) [1, 7].  Data on the relative

frequency of DLB and PDD may be similarly affected by
this subspecialty referral pattern. Whether or not the dis-
tinction has treatment implications is difficult to deter-
mine. This review highlights the distinction only where
clinically relevant differences in outcomes have been
noted. Restricting this review only to evidence-based treat-
ments would mean that it could not be comprehensive,
since many treatments have not been studied in DLB or
PDD populations. In these instances, evidence from
Parkinson’s disease (PD) studies is used to guide clinical
recommendations.
The management of DLB is replete with quandaries: in
choosing to treat one symptom, we often produce com-
plications in other facets of the disease. For example,
dopamine replacement for motor symptoms frequently
exacerbates a patient’s neuropsychiatric symptoms, anti-
psychotic treatment of hallucinations risks a potentially
fatal adverse reaction, and cholinesterase inhibitor treat-
ment of cognitive symptoms can complicate cardiac and
gastrointestinal dysautonomia. These quandaries make
the treatment of DLB challenging, yet just as rewarding

as navigating between Scylla and Charybdis. The side-
effect proclivity applies to medications prescribed by other
physicians, so it is essential to rationalize treatment and to
communicate with other care providers about the com-
plexities of the disease. An understanding of the pervasive
effects of alpha-synuclein can also assist the physician to
make sense of nonspecific or vague complaints, particu-
larly when advanced disease impairs a patient’s ability to
communicate. For example, a feeling of general malaise or
lethargy can reflect orthostatic hypotension, a common
and under-recognized feature of the disease.
Many symptoms of DLB are noncognitive in nature,
and many are under-recognized [8–10]. It can be helpful
to divide the array of symptoms into five symptom cat-
egories: cognitive, neuropsychiatric, movement, auto-
nomic, and sleep. Patients often view DLB as a purely
cognitive disease, and consequently will not volunteer
noncognitive symptoms since they do not believe they
are a consequence of the disease. Directed questions in
each of the five categories can form the basis of a com-
prehensive treatment strategy that can improve the pa-
tient’s quality of life [11].  The disease course can be
rapid, although prognosis varies between individuals. In
one study, life expectancy at diagnosis is 2.3 years
shorter for DLB compared with Alzheimer’s disease [10].
Cognitive symptoms
DLB-associated deficits in attention, executive function,
and visuospatial ability respond well to cholinesterase in-
hibitor treatment [12–14].  In meta-analyses, the stan-
dardized mean treatment effects are 0.34 for cognition
and 0.20 on behavioral and functional measures [13], al-
though most of the source data are from PDD patients.
These effects compare favorably with cholinesterase in-
hibitor treatment of Alzheimer’s disease [15],  because
the targets of therapy are relatively preserved in DLB.
Compared with Alzheimer’s patients, DLB patients have
relatively little neuronal loss but profound cholinergic
dysfunction [5, 16].  The characteristic fluctuations in
cognition in DLB are difficult to manage; they may have
multiple contributing causes [17]. Cholinesterase inhibi-
tor treatment is associated with reduced mortality; mor-
tality odds ratios in treatment trials are 0.28 (P = 0.03)
despite increases in adverse events on therapy (odds ra-
tio 1.64, P = 0.0003) [14].
There are no head-to-head trials comparing efficacy of
the cholinesterase inhibitors in DLB or PDD, but rivas-
tigmine has the widest evidence base [12, 18, 19].  A
Movement Disorder Society evidence-based review con-
cluded that rivastigmine is effective in PDD, but that the
data for other cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine
are inconclusive [20]. Special care is needed when starting
cholinesterase inhibitors in patients with DLB because of
frequent disease-associated autonomic dysfunction [21]. 
Cardiac denervation [22] might increase the risk of symp-
tomatic bradycardia [13, 23], or QT prolongation. Gastro-
intestinal dysautonomia [24, 25] means patients may be
more at risk for the common cholinesterase inhibitor side
effects of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and weight
loss [13, 26]. To treat these, the clinician should eschew
antagonists of dopamine, acetylcholine, or histamine in
favor of 5HT-3 receptor antagonists such as ondansetron
or granisetron. Rivastigmine has a transdermal formula-
tion with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. DLB patients
frequently have disordered sleep and so may be more
likely to experience the vivid dreams that are an under-
recognized side effect of cholinesterase inhibitors. These
dreams can be limited by avoiding night-time doses; for
cholinesterase inhibitors that require twice-daily dosing,
the second dose may be given in the afternoon.
Only one of four trials of memantine in DLB/PD/PDD
found significant effects in the primary outcome [27].
The results may be driven by data from PDD rather than
DLB subjects, and may only be present with concurrent
cholinesterase inhibitor treatment [27, 28]. Atomexetine
[29], rasagiline [30] and levodopa [31, 32] have variable
effects on cognition in PD/PDD populations [33].
Neuropsychiatric symptoms
Anxiety and depression
Anxiety and depression are common in DLB; they affect
27 % and 59 % of cases, respectively [10]. Like many non-
motor symptoms of synucleinopathy, anxiety and depres-
sion can predate the onset of parkinsonism and dementia
by decades [10, 21, 34], possibly due to early pathology in
serotonergic projection cells of the dorsal raphe [35, 36].
Incipient synucleinopathy should therefore be considered
in the differential diagnosis of late-onset anxiety and de-
pression, particularly in patients without an obvious pre-
cipitant and/or subtle parkinsonism [37, 38].
There are no controlled trials of treatments for anxiety
in DLB or PDD [33]. Depression was one of four neuro-
psychiatric symptoms in a composite measure that im-
proved in trials of rivastigmine [39] and olanzapine [27,
40]. A single, uncontrolled trial of citalopram and risper-
idone in 31 patients found no improvement for either
drug after 12 weeks [41]. Otherwise, there is a paucity
of evidence in the treatment of depression in DLB. Sero-
tonin and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
antidepressants have mixed results in the treatment of
PD-related depression [20, 42, 43].  Electroconvulsive
treatment and transcranial magnetic stimulation are
both effective in DLB [44, 45].
Hallucinations and delusions
Hallucinations occur in 60 to 70 % of DLB patients [8].
Commonly, they begin in the first 2 or 3 years of the dis-
ease whereas they are a late phenomenon in Alzheimer’s

disease [46].  There may also be qualitative differences.
In Alzheimer’s disease, hallucinations generally have a
threatening or fearful quality [47].  They are often ac-
companied by delusions of suspicion [47].  In contrast,
the hallucinations in DLB are often (but not always)
nonthreatening misperceptions of ambiguous stimuli.
For example, a patient may misinterpret a shadow to be
a person or an animal. Tests of these misperceptions,
termed pareidolias, accurately differentiate DLB from
Alzheimer’s disease [48].  Electing not to treat these
symptoms is often appropriate, but cholinesterase inhibi-
tor therapy is safe and effective [39].  In one study of
PDD, more than 90 % of patients reported reduced vis-
ual hallucinations with cholinesterase inhibitor use [12].
The hallucinations can be minimized by regular vision
correction and a bright light or no light policy, whilst
minimizing the risk of falls. Medications that can exacer-
bate neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB should also be
stopped. These include anticholinergic medications,
amantadine, dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase in-
hibitors, catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors, and
levodopa, bearing in mind that abrupt cessation can trig-
ger the neuroleptic malignant syndrome [49].
The most fraught decision in the management of DLB
relates to the use of antipsychotic medications. In
Alzheimer’s disease and all-cause dementia studies, anti-
psychotic medications are rarely effective at reducing
symptoms [50] and they increase the risk of stroke and
sudden cardiac death by at least 50 % [51, 52]. Ceasing
these medications decreases the risk of death by the
same amount [53].  The latter study counters the idea
that the antipsychotic-associated mortality is due to con-
founding by indication. This theory states that end-stage
dementia causes increased mortality and also causes the
prescription of antipsychotics. Data from these pivotal
studies led to a US Food and Drug Administration black-
box warning for antipsychotic medication use in dementia
and a substantial change in prescribing practice.
A major factor in the success or otherwise of treat-
ment trials of antipsychotic medications in DLB and
other dementia relates to the target symptoms. Halluci-
nations and delusions are more likely to respond to these
medications than behavioral disturbance, as described
below. Physicians should reserve the use of neuroleptics
for symptoms likely to respond to their use, after focused
behavioral interventions have been attempted. There is
ample evidence of efficacy for these behavioral interven-
tions [54],  but limited funds for implementation. Gitlin
and colleagues provide an excellent description of such a
program [55].
A continued role for antipsychotic treatment remains
for the short-term treatment of subjects at risk of harm
due to their psychosis [47]. Higher scores on the Neuro-
psychiatric Inventory may indicate a patient is more likely 
to respond to the treatment, particularly if the findings are
within the domains most amenable to treatment with
neuroleptic medication (see discussion below) [56].
DLB patients are particularly at risk of antipsychotic
medication morbidity and mortality. Severe neuroleptic
sensitivity occurs in 30 to 50 % of patients [57]. Typical
antipsychotics (for example, haloperidol) are best
avoided [57], but reactions can occur after any neurolep-
tic and no differences in mortality were found between
the atypical antipsychotics in all-dementia clinical trials
[50]. Profound sedation, confusion, exacerbations of par-
kinsonism, rigidity, dysautonomia, and death can occur
[4, 16, 57, 58] even after a single dose [57, 59, 60]. These
effects are associated with a threefold increase in stroke
occurrence and a twofold to fourfold increase in the rate
of cognitive decline [50, 53].  There is also evidence to
the contrary, however. Antipsychotic medications have
been well tolerated in DLB trials [61, 62], and a large ob-
servational study that controlled for cardiovascular risk
and psychosis severity found no increase in mortality
amongst Alzheimer’s disease patients [63].  Irrespective
of the controversy over the degree of risk, the large pla-
cebo response seen in trials of antipsychotics [27, 50]
and the data showing improved survival for those taken
off long-term antipsychotics treatment [53] dictate that
all new prescriptions of antipsychotics should include a
programmed trial of cessation [64].
The choice of which antipsychotic to use is also a
vexed question. Quetiapine and clozapine are equally ef-
fective in head-to-head PDD trials [49, 65],  although
other data show mixed results for quetiapine in under-
powered trials of DLB/PDD [20, 61, 62, 66, 67]. Despite
the paucity of evidence for its efficacy, many clinicians
use quetiapine, reserving clozapine for second-line or
third-line treatment because of its potential to cause
agranulocytosis [68–72]. More data are sorely needed to
inform antipsychotic medication choice in DLB. In the
interim, it is reasonable to select antipsychotic medica-
tions on the basis of their side-effect profiles. Patients at
risk for diabetes or hyperlipidemia should avoid quetia-
pine, olanzapine and clozapine, whereas those with ele-
vated cerebrovascular risk should avoid olanzapine and
risperidone [47].  Olanzapine is also associated with
motor decline in PD patients with psychosis [20].  The
Movement Disorders Society advises against olanzapine
use in PD [20], advice that might reasonably be extended
to DLB patients. Irrespective of which antipsychotic
medication is used, prescribers should be wary of the
cardiac denervation seen in the synucleinopathies [22]
and so consider monitoring the QT interval. This is es-
pecially important when cholinesterase inhibitor and
neuroleptic medications are used together. Fortunately,
several new agents without such side effects are under de-
velopment. For example, a recent trial of pimavanserin, a
Page 4
Boot Alzheimer's Research & Therapy (2015) 7:45  Page 4 of 8
selective serotonin 5-HT2A inverse agonist, shows great
promise in the treatment of PDD, both in terms of treat-
ment response and trial design [73].
Agitation and behavioral disturbance
Agitation and behavioral disturbance often respond to
simple measures such as caregiver training, removal of
fear triggers, and increased social interaction [74]. Many
triggers for agitation are fleeting, and episodes of agita-
tion are self-limiting, so watchful waiting is often prefer-
able to antipsychotic prescription [53]. In the late stages
of disease, when patients have difficulty expressing their
needs, pain is often a trigger for agitation: investigation
for potential sources of pain and empiric treatment with
simple analgesics such as acetaminophen should be first-
line therapy [75].  Antipsychotic medications have the
same qualifications to their use as noted above. Further-
more, behavioral disturbances such as sleep–wake cycle
disturbance, shouting, oppositional behavior, pacing, agita-
tion, and aggression are not good targets of therapy for the
neuroleptic medications. There are numerous carer train-
ing programs designed to decrease the disturbances, but
only six medications have evidence for efficacy, three of
which are readily accessible [76–78]. Successful programs
train caregivers to understand care situations from the per-
spective of people with moderate to severe dementia, and
to adapt their approach to such encounters to encourage
respect for the patient’s personhood [55]. Extensive train-
ing is required for program success [76–78].
Movement symptoms
The motor symptoms and signs of DLB are similar to
those found in PD, including rigidity, bradykinesia,
tremor, and gait difficulties. They may respond to phys-
ical therapy and home safety modification. As is the case
in PD, the primary prevention of falls is paramount in
DLB. Education on the importance of this point can be
punctuated with advice such as ‘gravity is your mortal
enemy’. Repeated falls should trigger a rapid assessment
and treatment of the cause(s).
The same medications that are used in PD for move-
ment symptoms are used in DLB, but they are usually
less effective than in PD [79]. Their use is often limited
because of their tendency to exacerbate the neuropsychi-
atric features of DLB [79–81].  Levodopa/carbidopa is
most useful in patients with prominent parkinsonism
and few or no neuropsychiatric symptoms [81].  Levo-
dopa/carbidopa is used in preference to the dopamine
agonists because the latter are more likely to induce
compulsive behavior. In one series, 24 % of PD patients
taking dopamine agonists suffered from this potentially
devastating constellation of side effects [82]. Amantadine
may reduce the severity of the compulsive behaviors, but
can also worsen dysautonomia and hallucinations [20]. 
Physical therapy and home modification are effective in
PD. Cholinesterase inhibitors may exacerbate tremor, but
only mildly so, and do not otherwise worsen parkinsonism
[26, 39]. Where possible, medications that can induce par-
kinsonism should be avoided – these include the dopa-
mine receptor blocking anti-emetics (for example,
prochlorperazine and metoclopramide) and neuroleptics.
Autonomic symptoms
Constipation
The most common autonomic complications of synu-
cleinopathy are under-recognized: 89 % of PD patients
have constipation or diarrhea. Sixteen percent of the pa-
tients have been hospitalized for bowel obstruction [24,
25]. Patients may be unaware that this is a consequence
of their DLB, since the symptoms usually predate other
aspects of the syndrome by many years [10, 21, 34]. Di-
rected questions and early treatment with a high-fiber
diet, exercise, stool softeners, psyllium [83], polyethylene
glycol [84],  methylcellulose, docusate, and misoprostol
[49] are effective. Increased bowel activity is a common
(and in this case welcome) side effect of cholinesterase
inhibitor therapy.
Genitourinary symptoms
Up to 83 % of PD patients experience urinary frequency,
urgency, and incontinence [85], for which oral trospium
and transdermal oxybutyinin are effective [20] alterna-
tives to trihexyphenidyl and oral oxybutyinin, which
cause confusion [8, 86–88].  Tamsulosin and bethanol
chloride are effective for prostatism and urinary reten-
tion [49]. Sildenafil is effective for erectile dysfunction in
PD [89],  but prescription requests should trigger a re-
view to determine whether levodopa or dopamine agon-
ist treatment is inducing hypersexual behavior [82, 85].
Postural hypotension
Orthostatic symptoms are common in DLB [58, 90];
their frequency and severity is a strong predictor of prog-
nosis [91].  Patients may not describe classic postural
symptoms, but instead mention nonspecific weakness or
lethargy. Reduction or cessation of antihypertensive medi-
cation, meal fragmentation, salt liberalization/supplemen-
tation and compression stockings [20],  fludrocortisone
[92], and domperidone [92] are all effective in the synu-
cleinopathies. Cholinesterase inhibition [93] and pyrodos-
tigmine [94] also improve these symptoms.
Sleep symptoms
Excessive daytime sleepiness
It is easy to underestimate the effect that excessive
sleepiness can have on a patient’s quality of life. Sedating
medications should be ceased and obstructive sleep
apnea, primary sleep disorders, and nocturia should be
Page 5

ruled out. Caffeine is a useful treatment in those with-
out periodic leg movement disorder of sleep or restless
leg syndrome [95].  The evidence for methylphenidate
and dextroamphetamine is mixed [20].  Modafinil was
effective in two of three PD trials [20, 96]. Eighteen of
20 patients responded well in a small, unblinded trial of
armodafinil [97].
Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder
Seventy-six percent of DLB patients act out their dreams
[98].  When confirmed by polysomnography, rapid eye
movement sleep behavior disorder is 98 % specific to the
disorders of synuclein [99].  The disorder may not re-
quire treatment unless it induces excessive daytime
sleepiness, or poses a physical risk to the patient or their
bed partner. Simple instructions can prevent harm: re-
move sharp objects from the bedside, use soft barriers
around the bed, or sleep in a tightly closed sleeping bag
(cocooning) [95, 100]. The enacted dream often involves
being chased or attacked, so bed partners should avoid
the dreamer lest they be incorporated into the dream
and attacked [95]. Randomized controlled trials demon-
strate that melatonin [101–103], rivastigmine [104], and
bed alarms that play soothing messages from caregivers
[100] are effective rapid eye movement sleep behavior
disorder treatments. The short half-life of melatonin
means that a second dose may be needed if sleep is
interrupted. Low-dose clonazepam is a recommended
second-line therapy [105]. 
is enough to qualify for this feature? Treatment options can
improve quality of life, but do not alter the course of the
disease. For many symptoms, the best treatments are non-
drug treatments. Regular reviews aimed at rationalizing
therapy can be beneficial. For example, anti-hypertensive
medications that were erstwhile well tolerated may induce
postural dizziness because alpha-synucleinopathy weakens
neurovascular tone. The most difficult decision relates to
the use of antipsychotic medications; these occasionally
benefit patients with hallucinations and delusions, but se-
vere reactions such as prolonged rigidity and decreased re-
sponsiveness are common in DLB. Recent trials of
antipsychotics with novel mechanisms of action hold prom-
ise for this vulnerable population.

Restless leg syndrome and periodic limb movement
disorder
These conditions often accompany the disorders of sy-
nuclein, and each other [106]. The treatment options are
identical for the two disorders; however, periodic limb
movement disorder does not require treatment unless it
is disrupting sleep or sleep architecture. There are no
trials of restless leg syndrome or periodic limb move-
ment disorder treatment in the context of DLB. The
dopamine agonists are not recommended in this setting
for the reasons outlined earlier. Standard treatment of
restless leg syndrome and limb movement disorder with
carbidopa/levodopa, benzodiazepines (and especially clo-
nazepam), and the alpha-2-delta calcium channel ligands
(gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin) are
effective in PD patients [106].
Conclusions
DLB is a complex disease with many challenging treat-
ment decisions. It is often under-recognized in the
clinic, in part because the core clinical diagnostic fea-
tures – fluctuations in cognition, visual hallucinations,
and parkinsonism – are nonspecific and subject to var-
ied interpretation. For example, how much parkinsonism
