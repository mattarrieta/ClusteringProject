REVIEW
Biomarkers in biological fluids for dementia with
Lewy bodies
Sebastian Schade1,2 and Brit Mollenhauer1,3,4*
Abstract
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) has become the second most common neurodegenerative dementia due to
demographic ageing. Differential diagnosis is still troublesome especially in early stages of the disease, since there is
a great clinical and neuropathological overlap primarily with Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Therefore,
more specific biomarkers, not only for scientific reasons but also for clinical therapeutic decision-making, are
urgently needed. In this review, we summarize the knowledge on fluid biomarkers for DLB, derived predominantly from
cerebrospinal fluid. We discuss the value of well-defined markers (β-amyloid, (phosphorylated) tau, α-synuclein) as well
as some promising ‘upcoming’ substances, which still have to be further evaluated.
Introduction
The isolation and successful detection of soluble β-amyloid
(Aβ) from biological fluids in 1992 [1] revolutionized our
knowledge of the connection between molecular pathology
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. The progressing
elucidation of the underlying and overlapping molecular
pathologies of several neurodegenerative diseases, including
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD),
has resulted in new biomarkers, which are urgently needed
for more accurate diagnosis and as possible endpoints for
clinical trials with future neuropreventive strategies. Thanks
to vigorous defining criteria, the stratification of dementia
with Lewy-bodies (DLB) as a molecular and clinical
‘in-between’ disorder has been pursued, but it still has
clinical and neuropathological overlap with AD and
PD [2,3],  which makes its early diagnosis difficult.
While hallucinations in AD predict the coincidence of
DLB with a specificity of 100% [4],  the presence of
non-motor symptoms, decreased dopamine transporter
imaging [5] and response to dopaminergic therapy does
not help to separate DLB from PD since only about 36%
of subjects can be clinically classified as ‘responders’ using
the L-dopa challenge [6,7].
The quantification of Aβ1-42 in CSF in combination
with total and/or phosphorylated tau protein was recently

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article 
(together with positron emission tomography and struc-
tural magnetic resonance imaging) included in proposed
research criteria for the clinical diagnosis of AD [8]. Here,
reduced Aβ1-42 and increased total/phosphorylated tau
protein in CSF correlate with neuropathologic features of
the disease - that is, Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles
and neuronal loss - as well as clinical symptoms and dis-
ease intensity [9]. This CSF signature is a good predictor
for cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment [10]
with high predictive value for identifying converters into
overt dementia [11].
In PD, the underlying pathology is characterized by
presynaptic α-synuclein (aSyn) aggregates and synapse
rarefaction. Cognitive decline in PD occurs due to various
reasons leading to destruction of essential networks [12].
The main question of whether and how much AD and
aSyn pathology each contribute to cognitive decline in PD
remains disputable [13]. A majority of DLB patients show
increased cortical 11C-PIB binding, similar to AD [14,15].
This suggests that DLB is actually a dementia associated
with both aSyn and Aβ pathology, thereby possibly
explaining its aggressive nature. PD with dementia
(PDD),  in contrast, shows a reduced prevalence of
amyloid plaques and lower levels of cortical 11C-PIB
binding than DLB [14-16].  This finding suggests that
the dementia of PD subjects is more likely due to a
specific aSyn pathology rather than only an overlap of
other pathologies, in agreement with post-mortem ob-
servations [17,18].  Others suggest, however, that the
neuropathological correlate of PDD is a combination

of different pathologies rather than the severity of any
single pathology [3]. In addition, it has been proposed
that the presence of Aβ triggers cognitive decline and
dementia in PDD and DLB, but does not directly determine
its nature [19]. In this context, it should be highlighted that
incidental Aβ can be detected on occasion in healthy
controls as well as in older subjects with PD [15], and
decreased levels of CSF Aβ1-42 have been observed in
recently diagnosed PD patients [20] and in patients with
and without cognitive decline [21,22]; this suggests that
amyloid pathology does not have a single causative role
in dementia. Furthermore, it has been shown that PD
cases without dementia, but progression of cortical amyl-
oid, show a faster cognitive deterioration than patients
who are without Aβ deposits at baseline [23]. This is sup-
ported by a recent study that showed that low levels of
CSF Aβ1-42 predict early-onset cognitive decline [24].
Thus, one current major problem is the overlapping
neuropathology and the as yet incompletely understood
molecular constituents of the pathological changes. It is
expected that in the next years many more neuropatho-
logical entities will be identified and characterized at the
molecular level, which will also influence our thinking
of clinical phenotyping and the selection of biomarker
candidates in the future [25].
Biomarkers in dementia with Lewy bodies
In addition to imaging biomarkers (see article by Mak and
colleagues within this special series [26]),  biomarkers in
DLB include functional marker candidates, like electroen-
cephalography slowing [27] and the detection of rapid eye
movement sleep behaviour disorder and other sleep dis-
turbances with polysomnography [28].
Dopamine transporter imaging studies are helpful in the
differential diagnosis of AD, but are expensive and not
widely available. A biological fluid marker would be more
widely available (when shipped to a central laboratory),
cheap, and have low safety concerns. Optimal marker can-
didates reflect a process proximal to the specific pathology;
therefore, most studies on neurodegenerative disorders rely
on marker candidates in the CSF. The ‘CSF analytic area’
comprises the area of the brain directly contributing to CSF
composition, which incorporates the basal ganglia and the
brainstem as main sites of interest in movement disorders.
aSyn pathology in DLB (and PD) has also been shown in
the periphery [29], however, which could enable the detec-
tion of a marker in peripheral biological fluids; for example,
in blood or saliva [30]. So far, studies have been discrepant
and need further validation (see below).
Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers in dementia with Lewy
bodies
The composition and alteration of CSF proteins, which
might be disease-specific, underlines the value of CSF 
analysis as a diagnostic tool. Nevertheless, known and
potential confounding factors need to be taken into
account in any biological fluid study, such as protease
activity, blood contamination - which occurs in 10 to
20% of lumbar punctures - and adhesion, especially of
lipophilic proteins to certain external surfaces like
polypropylene and glass. The adherence of standard oper-
ating procedures is essential to avoid false positive or
negative findings.
Alzheimer’s disease biomarkers in dementia with Lewy
bodies
The combination of decreased Aβ peptides and increased
total/phosphorylated tau protein in CSF of AD subjects
has shown diagnostic sensitivity and specificity above 80%
in most studies [9].
Enzymatic cleavage of the 120 kDa transmembrane
amyloid precursor protein leads to different fragments of
the Aβ peptide [31]. Aβ seems to be important for the
processing of information between neurons and is vari-
ably prone to aggregate and form plaques [32]. Amyloid
plaques are found in the brain of patients with AD and
DLB [31,33] and contain primarily carboxy-terminally
elongated forms of Aβ peptides, such as the fragment
Aβ1-42.
As in AD, CSF levels of Aβ1-42 in DLB are regularly
decreased compared to non-demented controls [34]. The
correlation of decreased CSF Aβ values was shown by
in vivo brain amyloid load in AD [35] but also appeared to
be non-specifically decreased in other disorders without
plaque pathology [36], which might be due to interindivid-
ual differences in the amount of amyloidogenic amyloid
precursor protein processing. Attempts to normalize
Aβ1-42 concentrations to Aβ1-40 (Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ra-
tio) have been promising in terms of differentiating AD
from DLB when compared with measuring these bio-
markers individually [37].  Nevertheless, most studies
could not define valuable cutoff scores to distinguish
AD and DLB [38,39], including one large autopsy study
[40]. One reason might be the heterogeneity and possible
interaction of neuropathological alterations in DLB. At
least one study showed significantly lower CSF Aβ1-42 in
DLB patients with senile plaques compared with DLB pa-
tients without senile plaques [41]. Another reason could
be that a correlation between phosphorylated tau protein
in CSF and its neuropathological equivalent (neurofibril-
lary tangles) was not found in patients with DLB [41].
Other fragments, isoforms and posttranslational modi-
fications of Aβ peptides have also been proposed as CSF
biomarkers for DLB. The oxidized version of Aβ1-40
(Aβ1-40ox), containing α-helical structures [42], has been
shown to be increased in DLB patients compared with
PDD patients and non-demented disease controls, which
recently also has been shown in autopsy-proven AD and

DLB [43]. This finding has been proposed to be a patho-
physiological metabolism of Aβ1-40 specific to DLB, but
needs to be replicated by independent groups and using
alternative approaches. Other Aβ isoforms, such as Aβ1-37
and Aβ 1–38, are still a focus of research, but need to be
better characterized [42]. Further posttranslational modifi-
cations (for example, fragmented forms of Aβ) possibly
reflecting more disease-specific changes are currently
been investigated by different groups [44].
The natively unfolded microtubule-associated phospho-
protein 68 kDa tau is important for the stabilization of
microtubules [45]. Neuronal cells in AD contain pairwise
helical protein filaments (neurofibrillary tangles) [46,47]
that are insoluble, stable polymers of the low molecular
weight tau protein [48].
Intracellular tau protein is elevated in CSF of AD subjects
and excessively increases in conditions with rapid neuronal
loss - for example, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. In DLB, levels
of CSF tau protein are lower compared to AD [40] and
higher compared to PD and PDD [49]. Interestingly, pa-
tients with a diagnosis of ‘probable DLB’ according to the
classification criteria [5] (which should be more accurate),
tend to have even lower CSF tau protein levels [49].
Hyperphosphorylation of tau protein promotes its ag-
gregation into neurofibrillary tangles. Some CSF studies
have revealed better specificity for the discrimination of
AD when using p-tau protein 181 rather than total tau
protein [50]. Since the phosphorylation of tau protein in
brain occurs to a lesser extent in DLB [51,52], the quan-
tification of phosphorylated tau species in CSF may
serve as a specific marker to discriminate AD from DLB
[50,53].  Other phosphorylation sites of tau protein in
CSF have been analyzed for their diagnostic value, show-
ing similar results [54-57] (Table 1). 
Parkinson’s disease biomarkers in dementia with Lewy
bodies
The 140 amino acid aSyn is predominantly expressed in
the pre-synapses supporting the formation and transport
of vesicles [58] and is the major constituent of Lewy
bodies, the generally accepted pathological hallmark of
PD and DLB, and it is also present in the glial cytoplasmic
inclusions of multiple system atrophy [59,60].
Full-length aSyn has been detected in extracellular
biological fluids, including plasma, conditioned cell
media and most recently saliva [61,62]. The quantification
of extracellular aSyn has been proposed as a potential bio-
marker for synuclein-related disorders: most investigators
have shown a reduction of CSF total aSyn in the
synuclein-related disorders PD, DLB and multiple sys-
tem atrophy [63-65]. A rather small study, but one that
strictly controlled several possible confounders (for
example, blood contamination, diurnal variation, food
intake, rostro-caudal CSF gradient, gender, age), showed
contradictory results, with an increase of aSyn in DLB
compared with healthy controls and AD patients [66].
These results need to be replicated, but possible con-
founding factors (for example, blood contamination,
subject selection and technical/methodological differences,
especially choosing the right antibodies to ensure accurate
measurement of total aSyn rather than its fractions) should
be even more rigorously taken into account when conduct-
ing further studies.
The underlying mechanism of decreasing CSF aSyn
remains unclear to date, and could result from various
scenarios, such as the reduction of aSyn release into
the extracellular space due to intracellular aggregation;
alteration of SNCA gene transcription [67], mRNA spli-
cing [68] or protein processing [69];  a higher CSF flow

with lower permeation of plasma aSyn into CSF; an
enhanced clearance rate of aSyn from CSF [70]; or as
yet unidentified factors or any combination of mecha-
nisms [65]. Furthermore, aSyn might intracellularly aggre-
gate in Lewy bodies and presynaptic terminals (thereby
possibly decreasing the extracellular amount), since results
from studies on aSyn in patients with AD have been
somewhat heterogeneous, perhaps indicating a subgroup
of AD patients with additional Lewy body pathology and a
clear mismatch of high p-tau protein 181 and low aSyn
CSF levels [71]. A possible explanation for increased CSF
aSyn levels (in addition to the inverse of the mechanisms
described above) might be that they partly reflect neuronal
and/or axonal injury, which would be in line with a correl-
ation of total tau values and aSyn in CSF samples of AD
patients [71], although a correlation between aSyn levels
and regional brain atrophy could not be detected [72].
Whereas methods for quantifying total aSyn detect
mono- and oligomeric forms, an oligomer-specific aSyn
assay has been established that uses the same monoclonal
antibody for both capture and detection [73]. Oligomeric
aSyn comprises up to 10% of the total aSyn content of
CSF. Independent studies show an increase of CSF oligo-
meric aSyn in PD compared with AD, progressive supra-
nuclear palsy and controls [73,74].  Together with the
reduced CSF total aSyn, the ratio of oligomeric to total
aSyn had a sensitivity of 89.3% and a specificity of 90.6%
for the diagnosis of PD in this study [74].
Further investigation of the specificity of the antibodies
and total and oligomeric aSyn enzyme-linked immuno-
assay techniques are needed, as are independent studies
on other posttranslationally modified aSyn species, studies
quantifying CSF aSyn in longitudinal patient cohorts, as
well as studies of aSyn in other biological fluids.
Neurosin, a protein suggested to cleave aSyn and
thereby potentially with a major role in the pathome-
chanisms of diseases associated with aSyn pathology,
was shown to be reduced in CSF of patients with
synuclein-related disorders compared with healthy con-
trols and patients with AD. The lowest levels have been
found in patients with DLB, thereby offering a new option
for a potential biomarker [75].
Other PD biomarkers in CSF have not yet been inves-
tigated in DLB, such as the multifunctional protein DJ-1
and its oxidized forms involved in many cellular processes
[76-78], and other synaptic proteins.
Other potential biomarkers for dementia with Lewy
bodies
Neurofilaments
Neurofilaments (NFs) are involved in structural integrity
and cell/organelle motility along the axons and determine
axon calibre. CSF levels of NFs have been found to be
elevated in DLB, but no significant differences have 
been observed in comparison with other dementias.
Therefore, NFs seem to provide only a general hint of
neuronal and axonal dysfunction without differential
value for separating DLB from other disorders [79].
But data are still rare. In particular, subsets of NFs
need to be evaluated further, since various types of
neurons are affected in the different forms of demen-
tia, perhaps meaning that different patterns of elevated
NFs are potential biomarkers for differential diagnosis
of dementias. Three different subunits of NF (light
(NF-L), medium (NF-M) and heavy (NF-H)) have been
defined. The filament is made up of one NF-L and either
NF-M or NF-H arranged head to tail [80,81].
Fatty acid-binding proteins
Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are a family of small
intracellular proteins that facilitate the transport of fatty
acids between the cell membrane and different organelles
[82]. Lower levels of heart-type FABP have been reported
in brains from patients with Down’s syndrome and AD
[83]. Serum FABP levels are elevated in a quite distinct
manner in DLB [84,85].
Other potential biomarkers
On the basis of stronger pathological involvement of
dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways in DLB than in
AD, several neurotransmitters and their metabolites have
been investigated. Reduced levels of the metabolites
homovanillic acid, 5- hydroxyindolacetic acid and 3-
methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylethyleneglycol have been found
in DLB compared with AD [86]. Especially the latter, in
combination with total tau protein, p-tau and Aβ1-42,
could increase the sensitivity and specificity of discrimin-
ating those entities [87].
The chondroitinase sulphate proteoglycan Neuron glia 2
is a proteoglycan involved in several basic cellular mecha-
nisms of pericytes as well as oligodentrocyte progenitor
cells and its soluble form can be detected in CSF. Lower
levels of soluble Neuron glia 2 have been found in CSF of
patients with AD and DLB, but not in patients with PD or
PDD, thereby implicating some kind of association with
the accumulation of Aβ rather than aSyn. Results are pre-
liminary and mechanisms far from being understood, but
further investigations seem to be worthwhile [88].
Cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript is a
neuropeptide which is expressed selectively in the
hypothalamus and was recently found to be present at
significantly reduced levels in the CSF of DLB patients
compared with controls and patients with AD [89].
Further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary
data resulting from a rather small patient sample. Simi-
larly, elevated levels of calcium and magnesium in CSF as
well as of magnesium in blood were found by a Swedish
study group, which used mass spectrometry to compare

DLB patients with healthy controls and patients with AD
[90]. These findings have to be replicated by independent
groups. It is noteworthy that following our growing know-
ledge of molecular genetics in the field of neurodegenera-
tive diseases, there have been high expectations that some
gene products (for example, DJ-1, glucocerebrosidase)
might be of use as biomarkers. Unfortunately, results have
been either heterogeneous or rare in terms of DLB [91].
Finally, new diagnostic proteins might be discovered
by proteomic studies. So far, some ‘protein peaks’  have
been found as potential differential biomarkers, but these
have either not been attributed to specific proteins [92] or
have not been confirmed by further studies [93].  It is
problematic that there is a lack of consistency across
proteomic studies, which might be due to strong varia-
tions during sample preparation prior to the proteomic
experiment itself (for example, degradation of proteins by
storage material, contamination with blood) [94]. There-
fore, standardized procedures are needed.
Conclusion
This review summarizes current studies on neurochemical
marker candidates for DLB. Overall, it is clear that DLB is
a disease ‘in between’ AD and PD, which is supported by
clinical, imaging, neuropathological and neurochemical
studies. Biomarker candidates from the AD and PD fields
have been tested in DLB, but only a few have been shown
to more specifically reflect the underlying DLB. Most of
the markers reflect neuropathological features, but as long
our discrimination of PDD and DLB is based only on an
arbitrary ‘one-year rule’ without separation based on mo-
lecular pathology, biomarker studies with DLB subjects
will be hampered [95].
