Abstract
Introduction: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between visual hallucinations in dementia
with Lewy bodies (DLB) and brain perfusion using single-photon emission computed tomography.
Methods: We retrospectively included 66 patients with DLB, 36 of whom were having visual hallucinations (DLB-hallu)
and 30 of whom were not (DLB-c). We assessed visual hallucination severity on a 3-point scale of increasing severity:
illusions, simple visual hallucinations and complex visual hallucinations. We performed voxel-level comparisons between
the two groups and assessed correlations between perfusion and visual hallucinations severity.
Results: We found a significant decrease in perfusion in the left anterior cingulate cortex, the left orbitofrontal cortex
and the left cuneus in the DLB-hallu group compared with the DLB-c group. We also found a significant correlation
between decreased bilateral anterior cingulate cortex, left orbitofrontal cortex, right parahippocampal gyrus, right
inferior temporal cortex and left cuneus perfusion with the severity of hallucinations.
Conclusions: Visual hallucinations seem to be associated with the impairment of anterior and posterior regions
(secondary visual areas, orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex) involved in a top-down and bottom-up
mechanism, respectively. Furthermore, involvement of the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and right parahippocampal
gyrus seems to lead to more complex hallucinations.
Introduction
In people older than 65 years of age, dementia with Lewy
bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of neuro-
degenerative dementia after Alzheimer disease (AD) [1,2].
Visual hallucinations (VHs) are one of the commonest
features of DLB, present in 54% to 70% of patients [3]. It
most frequently consists of simple visual illusions wherein
objects are distorted or deformed, even though more
complex hallucinations may also occur.
Different hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
occurrence of VHs in DLB. One of the main hypotheses is
that VHs could be consecutive to visuospatial, visuoper-
ceptual or attention deficits, which are more frequent in
DLB with VHs than in either DLB without VHs or AD
[4]. These visual deficits of central origin are coherent

with the specific occipital hypoperfusion in DLB [5].
Another hypothesis is a dysregulation of the gating and
filtering of external perception and internal image produc-
tion [6]. The developers of the Perception and Attention
Deficit model proposed that VHs are caused by a combin-
ation of impaired attentional binding (top-down) and per-
ceptual processes (bottom-up) [7].
To support theses hypotheses, some study researchers
have investigated the relationship between VH and cere-
bral perfusion or metabolism [8-15] or atrophy by using
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [16] in patients with
neurodegenerative disease. Howard et al. [8] found a de-
creased reaction of the visual cortex to a visual stimulus
during hallucinations in a patient with DLB. Nagahama
et al. [10] studied 100 patients with DLB patients with
or without hallucinations using single-photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT).  Those authors dem-
onstrated the involvement of both posterior (bilateral
occipital and parietal cortices) and less significantly an-
terior regions (bilateral middle frontal gyri and bilateral
posterior cingulate gyri) in the group with hallucinations.

In another study, Pernezcky et al. [13] suggested the in-
volvement of hypometabolism in both visual associative
areas (right temporo-occipital cortex) and the prefrontal
region (right middle frontal gyrus). Moreover, the involve-
ment of the anterior region was demonstrated in a volu-
metric study in which Sanchez-Castaneda et al.  [16]
showed right inferior frontal gyrus atrophy in patients
with DLB with VHs. The authors supposed that the pre-
frontal region is involved in insight into and consciousness
of the hallucinations.
The aim of our study was to investigate the neural
basis of VHs in DLB and, moreover, the qualitative in-
tensity of VH, which has never previously been investi-
gated in DLB, to the best of our knowledge. Working
with the hypothesis that a deficit both in visual treat-
ment of information and in executive control could con-
tribute to VH, we posited that the group of DLB
patients with VH would have greater hypoperfusion in
posterior regions (that is, occipital and parietotemporal
cortices) and the anterior region (that is, prefrontal cor-
tex),  respectively, as compared with the group without
VH.
Methods
Ethics statement
Our study did not need ethical approval or the patients’
written consent according to French legislation, because
it was a retrospective study and SPECT was performed
during the patients’ follow-up.
Methodology
We conducted a retrospective study of patients diagnosed
with DLB by three neurologist experts in dementia in the
Memory Clinic of the Department of Neurology, University
Hospital of Strasbourg, France, between 2006 and 2010. To
be included, the patients had to have a probable or possible
DLB diagnosis as defined by McKeith’s 2005 criteria [17],
and a SPECT scan had to have been performed during the
patients’ follow-up. SPECT is included in routine diagnos-
tic workups of these patients and is performed for all pa-
tients to help in making the diagnosis. To distinguish
DLB from Parkinson disease associated with dementia,
we excluded patients in whom cognitive impairment
had occurred more than 2 years after they were diag-
nosed with the extrapyramidal syndrome.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We studied 100 patients’  records, and a total of 66 pa-
tients were included in the study. Nineteen patients were
excluded because they had not undergone a SPECT scan;
twelve patients were excluded because the diagnosis was
uncertain (AD for two patients, trisomy 21 for three pa-
tients, epilepsy with memory deficit for two patients, vascu-
lar dementia for two patients, metabolic encephalopathy 
for one patient, Parkinson disease for one patient and no
diagnosis for one patient); two patients were excluded be-
cause they had only auditory hallucinations; and one pa-
tient was excluded because he did not speak French. We
also excluded patients with clinical features that could be
explained by another cause, patients whose clinical re-
cords were incomplete and patients with hallucinations of
a nonvisual type (for example, auditory, somatosensory).
However, we included patients with another type of hallu-
cination (n = 6) if they were associated with VHs.
Patient records
Patients’  records were analyzed for the following items:
sex, age, family history, personal history of depression,
presence and severity of an extrapyramidal syndrome
(tremor, extrapyramidal rigidity or akinesia),  existence
and type of hallucinations, presence of motor or cognitive
fluctuations, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and
neuropsychological assessment, presence of a psychiatric
disease or a sleep disorder evocative of a rapid eye move-
ment sleep disorder, results of other investigations (cere-
brospinal fluid biomarkers, including tau, phosphorylated
tau, Aβ1–42 
(Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium),  brain [123I]
FP-CIT SPECT, brain MRI, electroencephalography) and
patients’ medications at the time of the SPECT. By using
the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale III score
[18], akinesia, rigidity and tremor were rated from 0 to
4 (0 = no symptoms to 4 = serious impairment).
Assessments
Hallucinations were assessed by neurology experts. The
patients were asked the following question: “Have you
ever seen things that do not exist?” Different types of
tests were applied in different patients during follow-up
to evaluate cognitive function. The most frequently used
tests were the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test
(FCSRT) [19] for episodic memory, the Frontal Assess-
ment Battery (FAB) [20], Trail Making Test (TMT) A
and B [21] and formal and semantic lexical evocation
[22] for executive function; and a digit-span test for at-
tention and working memory and the Rey-Osterrieth
Complex Figure Test [23] for visuoconstructive function.
Single-photon emission computed tomography
Image acquisition
A SPECT scan was obtained by a nuclear medicine phys-
ician for every patient during follow-up. The procedure
used was as follows. The patients received an injection of
740 MBq of [99mTc]ethyl cysteinate dimer (Neurolite;
Lantheus Medical Imaging, North Billerica, MA, USA)
(eight patients received 740 MBq of [99mTc]exametazime
Ceretec; GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). The image
acquisition began 15 minutes after injection with a dual-
head gamma camera (Siemens Medical Imaging, Hoffman
Page 3
Heitz et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy (2015) 7:6  Page 3 of 8
Estates, IL, USA) equipped with a fan beam collimator
specially manufactured for the study of the brain. Patients
were imaged while in the supine position. The heads of
the gamma camera were 15 cm away from the center of
rotation. The height of the table was 20 cm. Image acqui-
sition included 32 tomographic projections of 50 seconds
each. The acquisition matrix was 128 × 128 pixels with
zoom set at 1.23. The acquisition window was focused on
the energy of the 99mTc isotope photopeak (that is,
140 keV) with a window width of 15%.
Image processing
For image processing, we used SPM8 software (Statistical
Parametric Mapping; Wellcome Department of Imaging
Neuroscience, University College London [24]) running
on MATLAB R2010a (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA).
SPECT images of each patient were spatially normalized
to the Montreal Neurological Institute space. Intensities
were linearly scaled using the average perfusion of the
central regions of cerebellum because these areas are
almost preserved in patients with DLB. Finally, images
were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 12 mm.
Statistical analysis
Patients were divided into two groups: a group of patients
with DLB who were having VHs (DLB-hallu) and a con-
trol group of patients with DLB who were not having VHs
(DLB-c). There were 36 patients in the DLB-hallu group
and 30 patients in the DLB-c group.
We used the voxel-based statistical framework pro-
vided in SPM8 to compare the images of the two
groups. We performed voxel-level comparison of
perfusion of the DLB-hallu group with that of the
DLB-c group using a two-sample t-test with age and
type of tracer as covariates. Statistical maps were
thresholded with P < 0.001 with a minimum cluster
size of 25 voxels.
A second one-tailed analysis was then undertaken to
investigate the putative correlation between perfusion
intensity and the severity score of hallucinations while
still considering age and type of radiotracer as covariates.
We also chose a threshold of P < 0.001 and a minimum
cluster size of 25 voxels.
These analyses were conducted without correction for
multiple testing. Statistical maps were analyzed with Xjview
[25], which allowed us to identify the brain regions associ-
ated with the detected clusters.
To compare the general characteristics of the two groups,
we used a χ2 test for qualitative data and a Student’s t-test
for quantitative data. We used a Kruskal-Wallis test to
compare the three subgroups according to the type of
hallucination. A difference was considered significant at
P < 0.05. 
Results
The DLB-hallu and DLB-c groups were comparable with
regard to age, sex and MMSE score (see Table 1).  In
terms of clinical symptoms, there was no significant dif-
ference between the two groups for the primary criteria
for DLB. However, fluctuations seemed to be more fre-
quent in the DLB-hallu group, but this result did not
reach statistical significance (P = 0.07, 95% confidence
interval: 0.059, 1.2351).
With regard to cognitive performance, there were no sig-
nificant differences between the two groups (all P > 0.05)
(see Table 2). The DLB-c group performed worse than the
DLB-hallu group on the FCSRT, and the DLB-hallu group
performed worse than the DLB-c group on the TMT A,
but without a significant difference.
The DLB-hallu group was more often treated with
neuroleptics: seven by clozapine, two by olanzapine, two by
tiapride, one by cyamemazine and one by aripiprazole.
Within the DLB-hallu group, we divided patients into
three subgroups according to the type of hallucination.
Group 1 (n = 8) included patients with visual illusions (for
example, feeling of movement or deformation of an ob-
ject).  Group 2 (n = 9) consisted of patients with simple
hallucinations with vision of an isolated entity (for ex-
ample, a person or an animal). Group 3 (n = 6) comprised
patients who had complex hallucinations with the vision
of scenes (for example, several persons). For 13 patients,
we had insufficient information on the type of hallucina-
tions they were having. We did not find any significant

Cerebral perfusion
DLB-hallu versus DLB-c
Analyses revealed significant hypoperfusion (P < 0.001)
in three brain regions in the DLB-hallu group compared 
with the DLB-c group: the left anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC) within the limbic regions (Brodmann area (BA)
32), the left orbitofrontal cortex (BA 11 and 47) and the
left cuneus within the occipital cortex (BA 18) (Figure 1
and Table 3). To evaluate the influence of neuroleptics on
these results, we performed supplementary analyses com-
paring DLB-hallu group and DLB-c group after exclusion
of patients who were taking neuroleptics. The results were
similar to those of the previous analysis, with additional
significant hypoperfusion in the left fusiform gyrus

orbitofrontal cortex (BA 11/47) and the left cuneus (BA 19).

Severity of hallucinations
In correlation analysis of cerebral perfusion regarding
the severity of hallucinations in the patients with DLB,
we found significant hypoperfusion in the bilateral ACC
(BA 32), the right parahippocampal gyrus, the right in-
ferior temporal gyrus (BA 20), the left orbitofrontal cor-
tex (BA 11 and 47) and the left cuneus (BA 18) (Figure 2
and Table 3).
Discussion
In this work, we studied two groups of patients with
DLB, one with and the other without VHs, who were
broadly comparable for general and clinical characteris-
tics. We found three regions with hypoperfusion in pa-
tients with DLB and VH. The first was posterior and 
consisted of the occipital cortex (cuneus),  which is in-
volved in visual information processing. The second cor-
responded to the ACC, which is involved in control
process and error detection. The third corresponded to
the orbitofrontal cortex, which is involved in inhibitory
control and has a network lateralized primarily to the
left.
In our study, hypoperfusion in the cuneus (BA 18)
seemed to be associated with the presence of hallucina-
tions. This secondary visual area, BA 18, is involved in
the recognition and extraction of object features (shape,
color, position in space, movement). Dysfunction of BA
18 causes errors in visual processing, with occurrence of
object distortions that explain visual illusions particularly
well. Patients with DLB report visual illusions more fre-
quently than true hallucinations [26]. The localized rela-
tive dysfunction of this visual area, which we found in
the present study, is consistent with previous data

right parahippocampal gyrus (BA 20) and the left cuneus (BA 18) (P < 0.001, including age and type of radiotracer as nuisance covariates and a
minimum cluster size of 25 voxels).

reported in the literature [9,10,12,15,27]. It confirms the
original hypothesis that the occipital dysfunction specific
to DLB [28,29] might be involved in the occurrence of
VHs. The implication of visual areas was previously con-
firmed by other studies [10,12,16],  in association with
the parietal cortex [10] or the right temporo-occipital
junction [12]. In previous work by our group involving
patients with AD chosen from the Alzheimer’s Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative database, we showed atrophy of
the occipital cortex in patients with VHs. In our study,
the left occipital region seemed predominant. Nagahama
et al. [10] also found a predominance of left occipital in-
volvement. This lateralization suggests that impairment
of visual perception is crucial in VHs, for which the
dominant pathway is the left occipitotemporal cortex,
whereas visuospatial function preferentially follows the
right occipitoparietal pathway [30,31].
In addition to these posterior aspects, we found hypo-
perfusion in the left ACC (BA 32) and the left orbitofron-
tal cortex (BA 11 and 47), suggesting that involvement of
the occipital cortex alone is not sufficient to cause halluci-
nations. The ACC is a part of the limbic lobe, which is ac-
tivated in tasks involving attention on the Stroop test and
go/no-go tasks and is supposed to play an important role
in attention, motivation, executive function and error
detection [32-34].  The ACC, aside from the insula, is
also known to contain the neurons called von Economo
neurons [35], which would be implicated in intuitive de-
cision making. Thus, in a complex situation where a
quick decision is needed, these cells would be crucial to
detect errors and make the correct decision. The func-
tional deficit of the ACC in patients with DLB could
lead to difficulty in error detection and correct decision
making. The orbitofrontal cortex is well known for this
role in inhibitory control and decision making [36].
Dysfunction of this area could prevent the patient from
inhibiting the production of internal images.
The following hypothesis on the occurrence of hallu-
cinations in DLB can therefore be proposed. Secondary
visual areas are deficient and send false data to the en-
tire cortex (ascending or bottom-up phenomenon). The
patient cannot recognize this information as abnormal,
because the ACC and the orbitofrontal cortex are also
impaired and the VH seems real (descending or top-down
phenomenon).  The presence of hallucinations requires
both a lesion of visual areas and one of control regions
such as the ACC and orbitofrontal cortex. Previous stud-
ies have implicated the cingulate gyrus in the genesis of
hallucinations [37]. It has been found to be the case for
the ACC in patients with AD and for the posterior cingu-
late cortex in patients with DLB [10,11]. Menthis et al.
found a significant hypometabolism in orbitofrontal and
cingulate areas bilaterally in patients with AD who had de-
lusional misidentification syndromes [38]. 
As in the study by Nagahama et al. [10], the left cingu-
lum was implicated in our study, whereas the right
hemisphere has been observed to be more particularly
affected in most studies. Nevertheless, we noted bilateral
involvement of the ACC when we took the severity of
the hallucinations into account. Severity was defined
here not by the frequency of hallucinations, but by their
type. A hallucination was considered mild if it was an
illusion and severe if it was a complex scene. On the
basis of our results, we suggest that the severity of VH
depends on the extent to which the system of error de-
tection within the ACC is impaired, with unilateral dys-
function being sufficient for visual illusions, whereas
bilateral involvement would be necessary for the vision
of complex and aberrant scenes. The severity of halluci-
nations also correlated with the inferior temporal cortex
and parahippocampal hypoperfusion. These results are
consistent with previously published data. Harding et al.
[39] found an association between hallucinations and
high densities of Lewy bodies in the parahippocampal
and inferior temporal cortices. In a recent study, Megevand
et al.  [40] showed that VHs could be evoked by direct
electrical stimulation of the parahippocampal area. Our
results support the role of the parahippocampal gyrus in
the perception of visual scenes [41] because its hypoperfu-
sion seems necessary for the occurrence of complex VHs,
but not for visual illusions.
Our study has some limitations. The diagnosis of DLB
was based on clinical features, and we did not have ac-
cess to the postmortem examinations to confirm these
diagnoses. However, the McKeith criteria for DLB have
very good specificity (98%) [42]. Exploration of halluci-
nations is difficult because they are transient and short,
and SPECT is often performed outside the hallucinatory
period. Functional imaging studies to show which areas
are involved during hallucinations would be interesting,
but they are difficult to achieve because hallucinations
are not predictable and require considerable cooperation
on the part of the patient, which is not easy to obtain in
patients with DLB. A higher proportion of patients with
hallucinations were on neuroleptics, and these drugs
could have influenced the SPECT findings. Handley
et al. showed frontal hypoperfusion secondary to neuro-
leptics (haloperidol and aripiprazole) in healthy volun-
teers, but anterior cingulate perfusion was increased
after neuroleptic treatment [43]. The same results were
found by Pardo et al.  [44].  The relative hypoperfusion
found in the ACC is possibly minimized by neuroleptics.
Conclusions
Overall, our study, together with previous studies, sug-
gests that the occurrence of VHs in DLB requires the
dysfunction of both the anterior and posterior regions,
which are involved in top-down and bottom-up

mechanisms, respectively. VHs seem to be related to im-
pairment of secondary visual areas involved in visual per-
ception and impairment of the ACC and orbitofrontal
cortex involved in control processes and error detection.
Well-formed hallucinations with complex scenes seem to
be related specifically to impairment of bilateral ACC and
parahippocampal gyrus involved in the perception of visual
scenes.
