Abstract
Introduction: The long-term efficacy and safety of donepezil 10 mg in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies
(DLB) were investigated in a 52-week Phase 3 trial.
Methods: This 52-week study consisted of 16-week randomized placebo-controlled (RCT) and 36-week open-label
extension phases. Of 142 DLB patients enrolled in the RCT phase (three arms: placebo, 5 mg, and 10 mg), 110 entered
the extension phase. The placebo group of the RCT phase initiated active treatment at week 16, and the active groups
maintained allocated treatment and dosages until week 24. After week 24, all patients received 10 mg. Dose reduction
to 5 mg for safety concerns was allowed. Efficacy measures included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for
cognitive function and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) for behavioral symptoms. Safety evaluations included adverse
events (AEs) and the unified Parkinson disease rating scale.
Results: In total, 100 subjects completed the study. Cognitive function improvement was sustained for 52 weeks
(MMSE at week 52 in 10 mg: 2.8 ± 3.5 (mean ± standard deviation); P <0.001, Student paired t test)). Those who
received placebo in the RCT phase showed an improvement after starting active treatment. NPI improved in all
the groups throughout the study, including the placebo period. In the subgroup of the 5 mg group without remarkable
cognitive or behavioral improvement at week 24, further improvement was observed after a dose increase to 10 mg.
After week 24, 21 patients experienced dose reduction. The incidence of any AEs did not increase over time.
Conclusions: The long-term administration of donepezil at 10 mg/day improved cognitive function for up to 52 weeks
in patients with DLB without increasing the risk of clinically significant safety events.

Introduction
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a common form of
dementia in the elderly, and constitutes the second largest
group of patients with dementia, following Alzheimer
disease (AD) [1]. The core clinical features of DLB in-
clude neuropsychiatric symptoms and parkinsonism, as
well as cognitive impairment characterized by deficits
of attention, executive function, and visual perception
[2].  The progression of cognitive impairment is faster
than or similar to that in AD [3-6]. Patients with DLB have
a higher risk for falls [7,8], higher risk of admission [9],

lower activities of daily living, lower quality of life, and a
heavier caregiver burden [10-13],  compared with those
with AD.
Cholinergic neurotransmission is more defective in pa-
tients with DLB than in those with AD [14].  Although
cholinergic losses in DLB affect both brainstem and
basal forebrain presynaptic nuclei, postsynaptic cortical
muscarinic and nicotinic receptors are preserved [15].
For these reasons, cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) may
be effective for treating DLB, and several clinical trials
have demonstrated favorable potential of ChEls such as
galantamine, rivastigmine, and donepezil for DLB [16-22].
The previous Phase 2, 12-week, randomized double-
blind placebo-controlled trial of three different doses of
donepezil in patients with DLB [22] demonstrated that

donepezil significantly improved all of the efficacy end-
points of cognitive impairment, behavioral and psychi-
atric symptoms, global clinical symptoms, and
caregiver burden, compared with placebo, and the
open-label 1-year extension study of donepezil at 5
mg/day [23] showed that the major concerns about the
safety of long-term administration of 5 mg donepezil,
including parkinsonism and cardiovascular events, were
minimal, and that the mild improvement of cognitive im-
pairment and psychiatric symptoms was sustained for
up to 52 weeks.
Based on these results, a Phase 3 study, which integrated
a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind compara-
tive study (RCT phase) and an open-label extension study
(extension phase), was conducted in patients with DLB to
confirm the superiority of donepezil at 5 and 10 mg/day
for 12 weeks over placebo and to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of long-term administration of 10 mg/day. The
RCT phase yielded the efficacy of donepezil on cognitive
impairment with significant improvement in MMSE com-
pared with placebo in the 10 mg group (mean ± standard
deviation (SD): 0.6 ± 3.0 and 2.2 ± 2.9 in the placebo and
10 mg group, respectively; P = 0.016, analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA)), although a significant difference was not
detected on the behavioral and neuropsychiatric mea-
sures (change in Neuropsychiatric Inventory-2 (NPI-2)
(mean ± SD):  −2.0 ± 4.2 and −2.9 ± 4.7 in the placebo
and 10 mg group, respectively; P = 0.391, ANCOVA),
falling short of confirming the pre-defined superiority
of donepezil compared with placebo at either dose (5 or
10 mg/day). With detailed information of the results re-
ported elsewhere [24], this report describes the results
obtained through long-term administration of the higher
dose of donepezil in DLB.
Methods
Patients
Patients diagnosed as probable DLB, according to the
consensus diagnostic criteria [2], were recruited from 72
psychiatric or neurologic specialty centers throughout
Japan from February 2011 to March 2012. Eligible patients
were outpatients aged ≥50 years with mild to moderately
severe dementia (10 to 26 on the MMSE and Clinical
Dementia Rating ≥0.5) and behavioral and psychiatric
symptoms NPI-plus ≥8 and NPI-2 ≥ 1).  NPI-plus con-
sisted of 12 items: original 10 items [25,26], sleep, and
cognitive fluctuation, which was reported as Cognitive
Fluctuation Inventory [27]. NPI-2 consisted of halluci-
nations and cognitive fluctuation [22]. Caregivers of the
eligible patients had to stay with them routinely at least
3 days per week and 4 hours per day, provide informa-
tion for this study, assist with the compliance with treat-
ment, and escort them to required visits. The evidence or
rationale for the presence of the core features, on which 
each diagnosis of DLB was based, was provided and exam-
ined by the review board (Mori, Ikeda, and Kosaka) to as-
sure the validity of the diagnosis.
Exclusion criteria included Parkinson disease diagnosed
at least 1 year prior to the onset of dementia; focal vascu-
lar lesions on MRI or CT that might cause cognitive im-
pairment (for example, infarcts/hemorrhages affecting the
thalamus, caudate nucleus, or globus pallidus, single in-
farct of diameter ≥1.5 cm or multiple infarcts in any other
regions, and moderate or severe white matter changes);
other neurologic or psychiatric diseases; clinically sig-
nificant systemic disease; complications or history of
severe gastrointestinal ulcer, severe asthma or obstruct-
ive pulmonary disease; systolic hypotension (<90 mm Hg);
bradycardia (<50 m−1); sick sinus syndrome; atrial or atrio-
ventricular conduction block; QT-interval prolongation
(≥450 ms); hypersensitivity to donepezil or piperidine de-
rivatives; severe parkinsonism (Hoehn and Yahr score ≥
IV) [28]; and treatment with ChEIs or any investigational
drug within 3 months before screening. ChEIs, antipsy-
chotics, and anti-Parkinson drugs other than L-dopa or
dopamine agonists were not allowed during the study.
Procedures
This was a 52-week, multicenter, Phase 3 study consisting of
a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
phase (referred as RCT phase) and the subsequent 36-week,
open-label extension phase (referred as extension phase)
(Figure 1).
After a 2-week prerandomization period with placebo
administration, the patients were randomly assigned in a
1:1:1 ratio to placebo or 5 mg or 10 mg of donepezil in
the RTC phase. Treatment began with 3 mg and was then
titrated. After the RCT phase (ended before Week 16), the
dose was maintained until Week 52 in the 10 mg group of
the RCT phase (referred to as DON10-DON10). In the
5 mg group of the RCT phase, the dose was increased
to 10 mg/day at Week 24 (referred to as DON5-DON10).
The placebo group started active treatment with 3 mg at
the beginning of the extension phase (at Week 16), and
the dose was then increased to 5 mg at Week 18 and to 10
mg at Week 24 (referred to as PLA-DON10). After Week
24, dose reduction to 5 mg was allowed if continuation at
10 mg caused any safety concerns.
The randomization code was broken in August 2012
after all data of the RCT phase were fixed before the end
of the extension phase (March 2013).  The physicians
and patients were kept blinded to the treatment alloca-
tion until the extension phase completion by blinded ti-
tration by using a similar placebo.
Written informed consent was obtained from the pa-
tient (if at all possible) and his/her primary caregiving
family member before initiating the study procedures. The
study was conducted in accordance with the principles of

the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved
by the institutional review board at each center (see
Additional file 1).
Outcome measures
Cognitive function was assessed by using the MMSE
[29]. Behavioral and psychiatric symptoms were assessed
by using the NPI-2 [22] and NPI-10 [25,27]. NPI-2 was
calculated as the sum of the scores for hallucinations
and cognitive fluctuation [26], which correspond to the
core features of DLB in the consensus criteria. These
measures were assessed at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24,
28, 34, 40, 46, and 52. Caregiver burden was assessed by
using the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview (ZBI) [30],
which evaluates the physical, psychological, and social
consequences of caring activities. The ZBI contains 22
items scored from 0 (best) to 4 (worst),  from which a
total score of 0 to 88 is calculated. The ZBI was assessed
at 0, 12, 24, 40, and 52 weeks.
Safety was assessed based on the adverse events (AEs),
vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests. All
AEs were classified and coded according to Medical
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terms.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, parkinsonian symptoms,
psychiatric symptoms, and arrhythmia were assessed as
AEs of interest. Motor function was assessed as a safety
measure by using the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating
Scale (UPDRS) part III [31].
Statistical analyses
Sample-size calculation is reported elsewhere [24].  The
safety analysis set (SAS) comprised all patients who re-
ceived at least one dose of donepezil and had safety-
assessment data. The incidence of AEs was summarized
based on the treatment period with the active drug;
safety analysis in the DON5-DON10, DON10-DON10
groups, and the combined group of them (referred to 
as DON-DON10) encompasses the entire study period,
including the RCT phase (52 weeks),  and that in the
PLA-DON10 group covers the extension phase alone
(36 weeks). Laboratory parameters and vital signs were
summarized by descriptive statistics. Scores or their
changes in UPDRS part III from the baseline in each of
the DON5-DON10 and DON10-DON10 groups or in the
DON-DON10 group were analyzed by using Student
paired t test.
Efficacy was analyzed in the full analysis set (FAS), in-
cluding the randomized patients who received the study
drug at least once and had valid efficacy assessment data
at more than one point. Exploratory analyses were per-
formed as appropriate to compare scores at every evalu-
ation point in each of the three groups with the baseline
(Week 0) by paired t tests, and in the DON5-DON10
group, also to compare scores at every evaluation point
with Week 24 to evaluate the effect of dose increment
by paired t tests and mixed-effect model for repeated
measures (MMRMs).  The parameters included in the
model were the Observed value at week 24 as a covari-
ate, and Subgroup stratified according to the degree of
improvement, Visit, and Interaction as factors. Values at
the final evaluation were imputed by using a last obser-
vation carried forward (LOCF) method.
P values were not adjusted for multiplicity. All statistical
tests were two-tailed, and P < 0.05 was considered to indi-
cate statistical significance. All analyses were made on
SAS versions 9.1 and 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Baseline characteristics
Of 161 patients enrolled in the pre-randomization period,
142 were enrolled in the RCT phase and randomized to
the placebo, 5 mg, and 10 mg groups (46, 47, and 49 pa-
tients, respectively). During the RCT phase (by Week 16),
32 patients were discontinued (9, 17, and 6 patients in the
Page 4
Mori et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy (2015) 7:5  Page 4 of 13
placebo, 5 mg, and 10 mg groups, respectively).  The
reasons for the discontinuations were AEs (17 patients),
patient’s request (11 patients),  and other reasons (4
patients).  In the placebo group, 37 patients started
active treatment at Week 16. During the extension phase,
10 patients were discontinued (3, 4, and 3 patients in
the PLA-DON10, DON5-DON10, and DON10-DON10
groups, respectively) because of AEs (6 patients) and
patient's request (4 patients) (Figure 2).
Demographic and baseline characteristics of the FAS
are summarized in Table 1. No characteristic differences
occurred between the three groups. Females accounted
for 58.0%.  The mean age was 77.9 (range, 57 to 95)
years; all but 2 patients were 65 years or older. Demen-
tia medication had previously been used by only 5.8%
of the patients. The mean score of the MMSE at base-
line was 20.4 points.
Cognitive function
Changes in MMSE are shown in Figure 3. Significant
improvement compared with baseline was observed from
Weeks 8 to 52 in the DON5-DON10 group, and from
Week 4 to 52 in the DON10-DON10 group. The mean
changes (mean ± SD, Student paired t test) at Week
52 and at the final evaluation (LOCF) from baseline
were 2.5 ± 3.1 (P < 0.001) and 1.3 ± 3.6 (P = 0.018) in the 
DON5-DON10 group, 2.8 ± 3.5 and 2.4 ± 3.7 (P < 0.001
each) in the DON10-DON10 group, respectively.
In the DON5-DON10 group, MMSE increased by 0.4
to 1.1 points at Week 28 to 52 compared with that be-
fore the dose increase at Week 24, although it was not
significant (Student paired t test). For further exploration
of this result, changes in MMSE by the subgroups with
and without MMSE improvement of 3 points or more
from baseline at Week 24 (cognitively improved and less
improved by 5 mg) were calculated (Figure 4).  Using
MMRM for the observed value at or after Week 24, the ef-
fect of dose increment was found significant (subgroup,
visit, and interaction were P = 0.018, P = 0.328, and P =
0.047, respectively).  In the subgroup of less-improved,
MMSE significantly increased after dose increment (mean
changes from Week 24 with SD (Student paired t test) at
Weeks 28, 34, 46, and 52: 2.2 ± 3.1 (P = 0.019), 2.6 ± 3.2
(P = 0.011), 2.0 ± 2.4 (P = 0.013), and 1.8 ± 2.2 (P = 0.019),
respectively).
The PLA-DON10 group showed significant improve-
ment from the baseline (Week 0) through the period after
starting active drug at Week 16; the mean changes at Week
28 or later were similar to those in the DON5-DON10 and
DON10-DON10 groups, in which treatment with active
drugs was started earlier.
In 18 patients whose dose was reduced from 10 mg to
5 mg because of adverse events (9, 4, and 5 patients in

the PLA-DON10, DON5-DON10, and DON10-DON10
groups), the change in MMSE from the last administration
of the 10 mg was calculated. The changes (mean ± SD) at 6,
12, 18, and 24 weeks after the dose reduction were 0.7 ±
3.0, 0.5 ± 3.5, −0.5 ± 3.6, and −0.7 ± 3.9, respectively; the
score was still above the baseline at 24 weeks after the dose
reduction (mean change from the baseline, 1.0 ± 3.8).
Behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms
NPI-2 significantly improved compared with baseline
from Weeks 12 to 52 in the DON5-DON10, and from
Weeks 4 to 52 in the DON10-DON10 groups (Figure 5).
The mean changes (mean ± SD, Student paired t test) at
Week 52 and at the final evaluation (LOCF) from base-
line were −3.6 ± 4.7 (P < 0.001) and −2.1 ± 4.8 (P = 0.005)
in the DON5-DON10 group, and −3.9 ± 4.2 and −3.4
± 4.4 (P < 0.001 each) in the DON10-DON10 group,
respectively. The PLA-DON10 group also showed a 
sustained reduction in the score from the RCT phase
under placebo administration through the extension phase.
In the DON5-DON10 group, NPI-2 decreased by 0.6 to
1.0 points at Weeks 28 to 52 compared with that before
the dose increase at Week 24, although it was not signifi-
cant (Student paired t test).  Changes in NPI-2 by the
subgroups with and without NPI-2 improvement of 30%
or more from baseline at Week 24 (behaviorally improved
and less improved by 5 mg) are shown in Figure 6. As the
result of an MMRM for observed value at or after Week
24 with observed value at week 24 as a covariate, and with
subgroup, visit and interaction as factors, the factor of
interaction were significant (P < 0.001) and the factors of
subgroup and visit were not significant (P = 0.282,
P = 0.199). In the subgroups of less-improved, NPI-2 sig-
nificantly decreased after dose increment (mean changes
from Week 24 with SD (Student paired t test) at Weeks
40, 46, and 52: −3.2 ± 4.0 (P =0.033), −3.8 ± 4.9 (P = 0.035),
and −3.7 ± 4.9 (P = 0.042), respectively).

Significant improvement in NPI-10 compared with
baseline was observed from Weeks 34 to 52 in the
DON5-DON10 group, and from Weeks 4 to 52 in the
DON10-DON10 group, with the largest changes (mean
± SD) at Week 40 (−8.8 ± 14.9) in the DON5-DON10
group, and Week 16 (−7.3 ± 7.2) in the DON10-DON10
group. The PLA-DON10 group also showed a sustained
score decrease from baseline for 52 weeks.
Caregiver burden
Changes in ZBI scores from baseline in each of the PLA-
DON10, DON5-DON10, and DON10-DON10 groups are
shown in Figure 7. The improvement was significant at
Week 40 in the DON5-DON10 group, but not at any
points in the PLA-DON10 and DON10-DON10 groups.
Safety
AEs were reported by 93.8% (90 of 96) in the DON-
DON10 group throughout the 52-week study period and
by 89.2% (33 of 37) in the PLA-DON10 group during 36 
weeks of the extension phase. Sixteen patients re-
ported 23 serious AEs. Of these, 2 patients died
because of asphyxia (PLA-DON10) or pneumonia (DON5-
DON10) while receiving 10 mg, but a causal relation with
the study drug was ruled out.
The incidence of AEs reported by more than 5% of the
DON-DON10 group is shown in Table 2 (by 12-week in-
tervals and total period). Major AEs with high incidence
were nasopharyngitis (17.7% (17 of 96)) and parkinsonism
(12.5% (12 of 96)).  Treatment-related AE reported by
more than 5% was only parkinsonism (10.4% (10 of 96)).
All the treatment-related AEs were mild or moderate, ex-
cept for 5 events (insomnia, visual hallucinations, irrit-
ability, agitation, and paranoia) reported by 2 patients
in the DON5-DON10 group. The incidence of no AEs in-
creased over time. AEs reported by the PLA-DON10
group showed a similar trend as the DON-DON10
group (Table 3).

than 5% were diarrhea, decreased appetite (6.3% (6 of 96)
each), constipation, and nausea (5.2% (5 of 96) each). All
the gastrointestinal events but ileus in 1 patient (DON5-
DON10, while receiving 10 mg) were mild or moderate
(Table 4).  In the PLA-DON10, the incidence rate was
32.4% (12 of 37).  Constipation, diarrhea (8.1% (3 of 37)
each),  abdominal pain upper, dyspepsia, gastritis, nausea,
and decreased appetite (all 5.4% (2 of 37) each) were re-
ported by more than 5%. All these events were mild or
moderate. Analyzed by 2-week intervals, the incidence
rate was the highest (22.2% (8 of 36)) in the interval
from Weeks 24 to 26 subsequent to the dose increase
to 10 mg. 
Parkinsonian symptoms were reported by 12.5% (12 of
96) in the DON-DON10 group; parkinsonism (12.5% (12

(Table 5). In the PLA-DON10 group (13.5% (5 of 37)),
parkinsonism (8.1% (3 of 37)),  akinesia, and tremor
(2.7% (1 of 37) each) were reported. None of the re-
ported parkinsonian symptoms were severe or serious.
Six events led to discontinuation or dose reduction in
these patients, but all of them were recovered or re-
lieved. UPDRS part III did not significantly increase
from the baseline in any groups (Table 6). In the DON5-

Discussion
The DON5-DON10 and DON10-DON10 groups showed
a significant improvement on the MMSE compared with
baseline for 52 weeks. The previous long-term study pre-
sented a similar treatment effect of 5 mg donepezil over
52 weeks [23]. These results suggest that improvement of

cognitive impairment by donepezil at 5 mg and 10 mg is
sustainable for at least 1 year in patients with DLB. In an
open-label long-term study of donepezil in patients with
mild to moderate AD, the improvement in MMSE was
maintained until 24 weeks after administration start, and
gradually waned and deteriorated afterward [32]. Consid-
ering this result in the context of a similar or faster pro-
gression in cognitive impairment in DLB than in AD [3-6],
the duration during which the cognitive improvement
induced by donepezil persists in patients with DLB may
surpass those with AD. Although learning effects due
to repeated tests possibly contributed to the improve-
ment in the extension phase, a 1-year lasting effect of
cognitive impairment is of clinical significance.
For behavioral and psychiatric symptoms, donepezil
administration at any dose (5 or 10 mg) reduced the
NPI-2 and NPI-10 over 52 weeks. However, similar im-
provement seen in the PLA-DON10 group, even from
the RCT phase, makes it difficult to attribute the im-
provement to the study drug. It is conceivable that care-
giver education about the disease and instructions on
coping, which were likely given at the beginning of and
during the study, affected the behavioral and psychiatric
symptoms. However, because it is unlikely to last long,
such an effect on the symptom improvement may be re-
placed or enhanced by donepezil after treatment initi-
ation and may lead to a 1-year lasting improvement,
even in the PLA-DON10 group.
With regard to the effect of dose increment in the
DON5-DON10 group, although no significant improve-
ment due to the dose increment was detected either in
MMSE score or in NPI-2 score as a whole, the subgroup
either with an MMSE change of <3 points or with a
NPI-2 change of <30% from the baseline at Week 24
showed an improvement after the dose increment. There
may be a range of doses at which the maximum im-
provement can be obtained, and 5 mg can provide a
sufficient effect to some patients. The expected further

improvement by increasing to 10 mg may allow recom-
mendation for a dose increase to 10 mg based on the
individual safety when 5 mg is insufficient.
After Week 24, 18 patients experienced a dose reduction
from 10 mg to 5 mg. Because MMSE scores remained
above the baseline at all times, without deterioration of
more than 0.7 points, the effects can be maintained even
with a reduction to 5 mg. When intolerable at 10 mg,
treatment could effectively be continued by dose reduction
to 5 mg.
No great difference was observed in the occurrence of
AEs due to the length of the administration period.
Thus, the possibility of delayed onset of AEs with long-
term treatment seems low. Most of the treatment-related
AEs were mild or moderate, and only parkinsonism had
an incidence of 5% or more. Of the 107 patients who con-
tinued the treatment beyond Week 24, dosage was re-
duced in 21 (19.6%) of patients. The main adverse events
leading to dose reduction were gastrointestinal, psychi-
atric, and parkinsonian symptoms. All of these resolved or
were relieved after dose reduction, and did not lead to dis-
continuation after the reduction. Gastrointestinal events
are well-known adverse events of ChEIs. Gastrointestinal
events most frequently reported by the patients who re-
ceived 10 mg of donepezil in the 52-week study in AD
patients were diarrhea (12.7%),  nausea (12.2%),  and
vomiting (10.1%) [33]; the equivalent incidences of these
in the present study in patients with DLB were lower. A
slight increase in the incidence after a dose increase from
5 to 10 mg suggests the need to pay attention to the oc-
currence of gastrointestinal events on dose increase. How-
ever, this comparison, the present result of mostly mild to
moderate severity and the absence of an increasing trend
in the incidence over time support a low risk for clinically
significant gastrointestinal symptoms.
Another AE of specific concern is parkinsonism; done-
pezil may induce or exacerbate extrapyramidal symptoms,
which are threatening for DLB patients in whom
Page 12
Mori et al. Alzheimer's Research & Therapy (2015) 7:5  Page 12 of 13
parkinsonism occurs frequently. However, none of the
reported parkinsonian symptoms was severe or serious.
Neither the incidence nor UPDRS part III scores were in-
clined to increase over time, representing no notable
deterioration over time. Psychiatric events were not con-
sidered to be notable safety concerns, according to their
incidence (including lower rate in 10 mg group in the
RCT).  Arrhythmic events require particular attention,
based on the incidence of 9.0% (12 of 133) of all the in-
cluded patients and 3 cases of loss of consciousness, one
of which was severe. In the RCT phase, the incidence of
arrhythmic events did not clearly tend to increase in the
active groups (placebo, 5, and 10 mg: 4.3%,  4.3%,  and
6.1%, respectively). In the extension phase, the incidence
by 12-week intervals did not exceed the incidence in the
placebo group during the RCT phase. As loss of con-
sciousness reported by 1 patient in the placebo group dur-
ing the RCT phase is certainly attributed to the disease
itself, those reported in patients who received donepezil
might not be necessarily attributed to donepezil.
Another safety event to be noted is abnormal weight
loss, which was reported in a substantial proportion of
patients. However, it was mostly self-limited and not ser-
ious, as it was rarely recognized to be an adverse event.
The findings suggest that no major concerns exist re-
garding the safety or tolerability profile of long-term
administration of donepezil at up to 10 mg. Safe and
tolerable treatment can be assured by alerting the patients
and their caregivers about the occurrence of parkinsonism
and gastrointestinal or arrhythmic symptoms and man-
aging the risks for such events by reducing the dose.
The major limitations include the short duration (12
week) of the RCT phase and the open-label design of the
extension phase as well as the small sample size. Because
of the progressive nature of this disease and the increasing
caregiver stress, it would be difficult to enroll patients with
DLB in a long-term placebo-controlled trial. For these rea-
sons, the long-term efficacy and safety of 10 mg of done-
pezil over 5 mg or placebo cannot be stated assertively.
Conclusions
The open-label long-term administration of donepezil at
10 mg/day improved impaired cognitive function for up
to 52 weeks in patients with DLB without increasing the
risk of clinically significant safety events.
