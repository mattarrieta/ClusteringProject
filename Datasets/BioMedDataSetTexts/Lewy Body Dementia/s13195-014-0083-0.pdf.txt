randomized, placebo-controlled, confirmatory
phase III trial

Abstract
Introduction: The efficacy of a cholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil, in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)
was investigated to confirm the superiority over placebo in the 12-week, double-blind phase of this phase III study.
Methods: Patients with probable DLB (n = 142) were randomly assigned to placebo or to 5 mg or 10 mg of donepezil
administered once daily for 12 weeks. The co–primary endpoints were changes in cognitive function assessed using
the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms using the Neuropsychiatric
Inventory (NPI-2: hallucinations and fluctuations). The superiority of each active group over placebo was determined
with simultaneous statistical significance in both endpoints. Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs) and the
unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS) part III.
Results: The predefined superiority of donepezil to the placebo was not confirmed in either active group in the
primary analysis. MMSE score significantly improved compared to placebo in the 10 mg group (10 mg: 2.2 ± 0.4,
placebo: 0.6 ± 0.5 (mean ± standard error); P = 0.016). The change in MMSE score in the 5 mg group was not significant
(1.4 ± 0.5 (mean ± standard error); P = 0.232). Although NPI-2 improved compared to baseline in the active groups,
the differences from placebo were not significant. Most AEs were mild or moderate. Although the incidence of
parkinsonism was slightly higher in the 10 mg group, the change in the UPDRS score was minimal and without a
significant difference from the placebo group.
Conclusions: The co–primary endpoints were not achieved in this trial. However, significant improvement in
MMSE score was demonstrated with 10 mg, but not 5 mg, of donepezil. The evaluation of psychiatric symptoms
might be affected by advanced education and instructions given to caregivers. Overall, donepezil was well
tolerated in patients with DLB. With careful attention on gastrointestinal or parkinsonian symptoms, patients with
DLB can safely benefit from treatment with donepezil.

Introduction
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most
common type of senile dementia following Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) [1]. The core clinical features of DLB are
fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations and motor
symptoms of parkinsonism, as well as cognitive impairment
characterized by deficits in attention, executive function
and visual perception [2]. Other features include neuro-
psychiatric symptoms such as delusions and depression,

as well as autonomic dysfunction. Fluctuating cognition,
hallucinations and delusions impose particular challenges
and distress on both patients and caregivers. The motor
and autonomic features have a further negative impact on
activities of daily living and quality of life [3,4].
DLB is associated with a greater loss of cholinergic
neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert and lower
choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity than AD, but
more postsynaptic muscarinic receptors in the cortex
are preserved [5-7]. The cholinergic depletion correlates
not only with the cognitive impairment but also with
psychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations [8]. On the

basis of these pathological features, it has been suggested
that cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) may be an effective
treatment for DLB [9,10]. However, no ChEIs have been
approved for DLB to date.
Previously, we examined the efficacy and safety of done-
pezil administered at 3, 5 and 10 mg for 12 weeks in
patients with DLB in a placebo-controlled, double-blind
exploratory study [11]. An open-label, long-term extension
study was then conducted in patients who had completed
the double-blind study to examine the safety and efficacy
of donepezil at 5 mg for 52 weeks [12]. The double-blind
study showed that donepezil at 5 mg or 10 mg per day
significantly improved cognitive impairment, behavioral
and psychiatric symptoms, global clinical symptoms and
the caregiver burden compared to placebo. The long-
term study showed that donepezil at 5 mg/day was well
tolerated and that it sustained improvement in cognitive
impairment and psychiatric symptoms over the course
of 52 weeks.
The aim of the present phase III study, integrating a
placebo-controlled, double-blind comparative study and
an open-label long-term extension study, was to further
evaluate the efficacy and to confirm the superiority of
donepezil administration at 5 mg and 10 mg per day for
12 weeks over placebo, as well as to evaluate the safety
and efficacy of long-term administration at 10 mg as
well as 5 mg per day, in patients with DLB. This report
describes the results of the placebo-controlled, double-
blind, 12-week phase. Detailed results of the extension
phase are reported elsewhere [13].
Methods
Patients
Patients diagnosed as probable DLB according to the
consensus diagnostic criteria [2] were recruited from 72
psychiatric or neurological specialty centers throughout
Japan from February 2011 to March 2012. Eligible patients
were outpatients aged ≥50 years with mild to moderate or
severe dementia (10 to 26 on the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating ≥0.5)
and behavioral and psychiatric symptoms (Neuropsychi-
atric Inventory-plus (NPI-plus) ≥8 and NPI (NPI-2) ≥1).
The NPI-plus consisted of 12 items: the original 10
items, sleep [14,15] and cognitive fluctuation, which is
reported as the Cognitive Fluctuation Inventory [16,17]
(see Additional file 1). The NPI-2 consisted of hallucina-
tions and cognitive fluctuation [11]. The caregivers of the
eligible patients had to routinely stay with them at least
3 days per week and 4 hours per day, provide information
for this study, assist with the compliance with treatment
and escort them to required visits.
The exclusion criteria included Parkinson’s disease
that was diagnosed at least 1 year prior to the onset of
dementia; focal vascular lesions visualized on magnetic 
resonance imaging or computed tomographic scans that
might cause cognitive impairment; other neurological or
psychiatric diseases; clinically significant systemic disease;
complications or a history of severe gastrointestinal ulcer,
severe asthma or obstructive pulmonary disease; systolic
hypotension (<90 mmHg); bradycardia (<50 m−1); sick
sinus syndrome; atrial or atrioventricular conduction
block; QT interval prolongation (≥450 ms);  hypersen-
sitivity to donepezil or piperidine derivatives; severe
parkinsonism (Hoehn and Yahr stage IV or above) [18];
and treatment with ChEIs or any investigational drug
within 3 months prior to screening. ChEIs, antipsychotics
and antiparkinson drugs other than L-dopa or dopamine
agonists were not allowed during the study.
Randomization and masking
This study consisted of two phases: a 16-week, double-
blind randomized control (RCT) phase and a subsequent
36-week, open-label extension phase. Treatment with
donepezil lasted up to 52 weeks in total. The RCT phase,
which was preceded by a 2-week (1 to 3 weeks) preran-
domization period, entailed the 12-week confirmatory
phase (Figure 1). In this article, we report the results of
the confirmatory phase. All patients were given placebo
tablets during the prerandomization period, after which
the patients were assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to placebo or
5 mg or 10 mg of donepezil in the RCT phase.
Randomization was performed centrally according to a
dynamic allocation, adjusting for MMSE and NPI-2
scores at screening. A member of the research staff who
was in charge of randomization and who was independ-
ent of all the parties concerned with the study securely
kept the randomization list with limited access only in
an emergency. No other members of the research staff,
including the physicians, nurses and study institution
staff were aware of the treatment assignment, nor were
any of the participants.
Patients received two study drug tablets, which were
composed of a combination of 3 mg, 5 mg, or the matched
placebo tablets with the same physical appearance, once
daily in the morning. The dosage was titrated at the begin-
ning. Treatment began with 3 mg for 2 weeks, and then the
dose was increased to 5 mg. Thereafter, the dose was
increased to 10 mg at week 6 only in the 10 mg group. The
dose was escalated after patient safety was confirmed. Dose
reduction was not permitted in the RCT phase.
Procedures
In the confirmatory phase, efficacy was assessed at base-
line and at weeks 4, 8 and 12. Co–primary endpoints were
cognitive function assessed using the MMSE [19] and
behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms assessed using
the NPI-2 [11], both at week 12. NPI-2 was calculated as
the sum of the scores for hallucinations and cognitive

fluctuation, which corresponded to two of the core
features of DLB in the consensus criteria. The original
NPI-10 (delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression,
dysphoria, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irrit-
ability/lability and aberrant motor behavior) was set as
a secondary endpoint.
Caregiver burden was assessed using the Zarit Caregiver
Burden Interview (ZBI) [20], which evaluates the physical,
psychological and social consequences of care activities.
The ZBI contains 22 items scored from 0 (best) to 4
(worst), from which a total score of 0 to 88 is calculated.
Safety was assessed based on adverse events (AEs), vital
signs, electrocardiograms and laboratory tests. All AEs
were classified and coded according to Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activities (“MedDRA”) terms. Gastro-
intestinal symptoms, parkinsonian symptoms, psychiatric
symptoms and arrhythmia were assessed as AEs of inter-
est. Motor function was assessed as a safety measure using
the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)
part III [21] at baseline and week 12.
Written informed consent was obtained from the
patients (if at all possible) and their primary caregiving
family members before initiating the study procedures.
The study was conducted in accordance with the principles
of the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol was approved
by the institutional review board at each center (Additional
file 2).
Statistical analyses
In a sample size calculation, the mean changes in MMSE
score were estimated to be −0.4, 2.0 and 2.0 with stand-
ard deviation (SD) of 3.3, and the mean changes in
NPI-2 score were estimated to be 1.1, −3.3 and −4.6
with SD of 5.2 in the placebo, 5 mg and 10 mg groups,
respectively, according to the results of the previous
double-blind study. The Bonferroni-corrected significance
level was set at one-sided 1.25%. Detecting the significant 
difference, predefined to be determined only with statis-
tical significance in both MMSE and NPI-2 results, with
at least 80% statistical power between the placebo and
5 mg groups required at least 126 patients (42 per group)
(statistical power of 80.7%). The number was expected to
provide power of 85.4% to detect a significant difference
between the placebo and 10 mg groups. Given that 10% of
the patients were excluded from the full analysis set (FAS),
the target number of patients in this study was set at 141.
Efficacy was analyzed in the FAS and the per-protocol
set (PPS).  Analysis using the FAS was positioned for
primary analysis. Mean changes from the baseline in each
outcome measure were compared between each active
group and placebo by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
with baseline values as covariates. Only the statistical sig-
nificance in both MMSE and NPI-2 between the placebo
group and each active group could determine the super-
iority of the active drug over placebo. The significance
level was adjusted for multiplicity using the Hochberg
method. In addition, MMSE improvement was evaluated
by responder rate, defined as the proportion of patients
with ≥3-point improvement.
The safety analysis set comprised all patients who
received at least one dose and had a postbaseline safety
assessment. The incidence of AEs was summarized by
group. For laboratory parameters and vital signs, descrip-
tive statistics and frequency distributions were calculated.
UPDRS part III scores were compared between each
active group and the placebo group using ANCOVA with
baseline values as covariates.
All analyses were carried out using SAS versions 9.1
and 9.2 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Patients
Of 161 patients enrolled in the prerandomization period,
142 were enrolled in the RCT phase and randomized to

the placebo, 5 mg and 10 mg groups (46, 47 and 49
patients, respectively) (Figure 2). Of these patients, 138
were included in the FAS (44, 45 and 49 patients in the
placebo, 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively).  Four
patients (two patients each in the placebo and 5 mg
groups) were excluded because of a lack of evaluable
efficacy data (three patients) and doubtful diagnosis of
probable DLB (one patient). Excluding 19 patients from
the FAS, 119 patients (40, 34 and 45 patients in the pla-
cebo, 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively) constituted
the PPS. The reasons for the 19 exclusions were discon-
tinuation within <8 weeks, compliance rate <75% or lack
of efficacy data due to a change in the evaluator.
Thirty-one patients discontinued (9, 16 and 6 patients
in the placebo, 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively)
with more discontinuations in the 5 mg group than in
the 10 mg group. The total discontinuations in the active
groups comprised 22 (22.9%) of the 96 patients, which
was similar to the placebo group (19.6%).
Demographic and baseline characteristics of the FAS
are summarized in Table 1. There were no characteristic
differences among the three groups. Females accounted
for 58.0%.  The mean age was 77.9 (range, 57 to 95)
years. All but two patients were 65 years of age or older.
Dementia medication had previously been used by only
5.8% of the patients. The mean MMSE score at baseline
was 20.4 points.
Co–primary endpoints (MMSE and NPI-2 scores)
Changes in the co–primary endpoints (MMSE and NPI-
2 scores) from baseline are shown in Table 2. Primary
analysis did not confirm the predefined superiority of
either active group to the placebo group.
Cognitive function
Mean changes from baseline in MMSE in the FAS and
PPS are shown in Table 3. In the FAS, the mean change
from baseline in the MMSE scores at week 12 (last
observation carried forward (LOCF)) was higher in each 
active group (mean ± standard error (SE):  1.4 ± 0.5 and
2.2 ± 0.4 in the 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively) than
in the placebo group (mean ± SE: 0.6 ± 0.5). Improvement
in the 10 mg group was significant compared to that in
the placebo group (mean difference from placebo = 1.6;
P = 0.016), but that in the 5 mg group was not (mean
difference from the placebo = 0.8, P = 0.232). PPS analysis
yielded a significant improvement in both active groups
(5 mg: P = 0.025, 10 mg: P = 0.004).  The responder rate
(MMSE score change ≥3) was higher in each active group
than in the placebo group (29.5%, 41.9% and 42.9% in the
placebo, 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively).
Behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms
Changes from baseline in NPI-2 and NPI-10 scores are
shown in Table 4. The changes in NPI-2 scores in both
active groups were not significantly different from that in
the placebo group. In the active group, NPI-2 improved at
week 12 (LOCF) (mean ± SE: −1.8 ± 0.6 and −2.8 ± 0.5 in
the 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively). However, the
placebo group also showed improvement of −2.1 ± 0.6
(mean ± SE).  The NPI-10 score improved at week 12
(LOCF) in each active group by −3.3 ± 1.4 and −5.5 ± 1.4
(mean ± SE) in the 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively,
and also in the placebo group, by −6.4 ± 1.5. There was no
significant difference between either of the active groups
and the placebo group.
Caregiver burden
ZBI score at week 12 (LOCF) was almost unchanged from
the baseline in the placebo group (mean ± SE: −0.1 ± 1.8).
In both the 5 mg and 10 mg groups, the score improved
by −5.0 ± 1.8 and −0.8 ± 1.7 points (mean ± SE), respect-
ively, but without a significant difference from the placebo
group. Subgroup analysis yielded a stronger trend of the
ZBI improvement in a group of caregivers who lived with
the patient, and a significant difference between the 5 mg
group and the placebo group (FAS-LOCF: P = 0.017).

The incidence of AEs and treatment-related AEs did not
differ substantially among the groups (AEs: 67.4% (31 of
46),  63.8% (30 of 47) and 69.4% (34 of 49);  treatment-
related AEs: 23.9% (11 of 46),  25.5% (12 of 47) and
28.6% (14 of 49) in the placebo, 5 mg and 10 mg groups,
respectively). The incidence of severe or serious AEs in
either of the active groups (severe AEs: 8.5% (4 of 47)
and 0% (0 of 49); serious AEs: 8.5% (4 of 47) and 2.0% (1
of 49) in the 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively) did
not substantially exceed those in the placebo group
(severe AEs: 6.5% (3 of 46);  serious AEs: 10.9% (5 of
46)).  The incidence of the AEs that led to discontinu-
ation was higher in the 5 mg group (21.3% (10 of 47)),
but lower in the 10 mg group (4.1% (2 of 49)), than in
the placebo group (10.9% (5 of 46)).
AEs with an incidence ≥5% in any treatment group are
shown in Table 5. Major AEs with a higher incidence in
either of the active groups than in the placebo group
were parkinsonism (4.3% (2 of 46),  4.3% (2 of 47) and
8.2% (4 of 49), in the placebo, 5 mg and 10 mg groups,
respectively, provided in the same order hereinafter),
decreased appetite (2.2% (1 of 46),  6.4% (3 of 47),  and
4.1% (2 of 49)) and nausea (2.2% (1 of 46), 6.4% (3 of 47)
and 2.0% (1 of 49)). The incidence of contusion in the
active groups (0.0% (0 of 47) and 2.0% (1 of 49) in the 
5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively) was low compared
to the placebo group (8.7% (4 of 46)).
The incidence of gastrointestinal events in the 5 mg
group was higher than in the placebo group, but that
in the 10 mg group was similar to the placebo group
(13.0% (6 of 46), 21.3% (10 of 47) and 14.3% (7 of 49)).
Decreased appetite and nausea were both observed in
>5% of patients in the 5 mg group, but the incidence
of no gastrointestinal events in the 10 mg group
reached 5%.  All gastrointestinal events were mild or
moderate in severity. When analyzed in 14-day inter-
vals from the baseline, the incidence in the 10 mg
group at the interval of days 43 to 56, the first interval
following the dose increase from 5 to 10 mg at week 6,
was the highest among the periods and the groups
(8.3%).
As parkinsonian AEs, only parkinsonism was reported,
and its incidence was slightly higher in the 10 mg group
than in the placebo and 5 mg groups (4.3% (2 of 46),
4.3% (2 of 47) and 8.2% (4 of 49)), all of which were mild
or moderate and not serious. Changes from baseline in the
UPDRS part III score were minimal in all of the groups
(−0.9 ± 0.9, −1.7 ± 0.9 and 0.4 ± 0.9 points (mean ± SE),
respectively) without a significant difference between
either of the active groups and the placebo group (5 mg:
P = 0.525, 10 mg: P = 0.306).

The incidence of psychiatric events was similar between
the 5 mg group and the placebo group, and the incidence
in the 10 mg group was lower than that in the placebo
group (10.9% (5 of 46), 12.8% (6 of 47) and 4.1% (2 of 49)).
The incidence of individual psychiatric events was <5% in
each group. Five severe psychiatric events were reported
in two patients in the 5 mg group: visual hallucinations,
insomnia, paranoia, agitation and irritability, all of which
were judged to be related to the treatment.
The incidence of arrhythmic events was similar among
the groups (4.3% (2 of 46), 4.3% (2 of 47) and 6.1% (3 of
49)). Each event was reported by only one patient, and
the events were of mild to moderate severity.
For vital signs, blood pressure, pulse rate and body
weight slightly declined in the active groups. AEs related
to vital signs were ventricular extrasystoles (n = 1) and
hypotension (n = 1) in the 10 mg group and weight
decrease (n = 1) in the 5 mg group. All of these AEs were
either mild or moderate. No patients reported any abnor-
mal changes in pulse rate. The incidences of abnormal
changes in the electrocardiogram were similar among the
groups (4.7% (2 of 43), 4.7% (2 of 43) and 6.3% (3 of 48)).
Discussion
In the primary analysis of the co–primary endpoints
(MMSE and NPI-2 scores),  predefined superiority over
placebo was not confirmed in either the 5 mg or 10 mg
group. However, in the evaluation of cognitive function
using MMSE score, the difference between the placebo
and 10 mg groups was significant, which is consistent
with the previous double-blind study [11].  The mean
change in the MMSE score in the 10 mg group was 2.2
points, which was almost equal to the score of 2.3
obtained in our previous study [11].
The improvement in the 5 mg group was found to be
significant only in the PPS analysis, although it was also
found to be significant in all analyses in the previous
study [11].  The results of the present study did not
replicate our previous finding, which is probably due to 
a relatively larger number of earlier discontinuations. In
the 5 mg group, eight patients (17.0%) discontinued by
week 4 when the blood concentrations of 5 mg donepezil
reached the steady state, whereas only one patient (3.0%)
discontinued in the previous study. The imbalance of
discontinuation was not caused by the dose of 5 mg itself,
because only one patient in the 10 mg group discontinued
by week 4, while taking the same doses as the 5 mg group
until week 6.
In two phase III studies in which the efficacy of donepe-
zil in patients with mild to moderate AD was investigated
[22,23], a mean change in the MMSE score of 0.24 to 1.35
points with a difference from the change in the placebo
groups of 1.02 to 1.36 points was reported. In contrast, in
the confirmatory phase of this study and in the previous
double-blind study [11] in patients with DLB, the mean
change in the MMSE score in the active groups (5 or
10 mg) was 1.4 to 3.4 points with a difference from the
placebo groups of 0.8 to 3.8 points, which exceeded the
equivalent scores in the two AD studies. Therefore, these
results imply that treatment with donepezil for DLB
provides greater improvement in cognitive function than
for AD, for which donepezil had already been approved,
reinforcing the clinical significance of treating DLB with
donepezil.
In the phase II study, donepezil clearly showed dose-
dependent efficacy against behavioral and neuropsychi-
atric symptoms [11]. In the present study, however, the
placebo group also benefited from improvement in these
symptoms, which represents the failure to replicate the
findings in the previous study. Which factors affected
the unexpected improvement of behavioral and neuro-
psychiatric symptoms in the placebo group? Two possible
reasons are conceivable in terms of the time of the trials:
(1) promotion of disease awareness and improved care-
giving methodology brought about by quantitatively and
qualitatively enriched disease-related information and (2)
the emergence of reports on successful psychosocial inter-
ventions in behavioral and neuropsychological disorders
Page 8

related to DLB. Psychosocial factors, as well as brain
organic and functional factors, have been reported to
cause symptoms such as hallucinations in DLB [24].
Anxiety alleviation, accompanied by enhanced disease
understanding, advancement in coping skills and pro-
motion of empathic attitudes through disease education
and instructions, may relieve symptoms (for example,
frequency or severity of hallucinations) [24,25]. Most of
the patients and their caregivers likely received disease
education and/or caregiving instructions or acquired
information on the disease and its care right before or
during the study. The education of and information
provided for caregivers may also have increased a positive
bias, because NPI is an assessment scale implemented
through interviews with caregivers. To lessen the placebo
effect, a lead-in period when nonpharmacological treat-
ment is administered has been suggested by a study in
which investigators evaluated the efficacy of pimavanserin
on psychosis in Parkinson’s disease [26]. The results of
our present study support our interpretation and the
necessity of disease-specific brief psychosocial therapy
in the lead-in period in future studies.
In the confirmatory phase, most of the AEs were mild
or moderate in severity. The absence of substantial dif-
ferences in the incidence of AEs or treatment-related
AEs, and the existence of fewer reports on AEs that led
to discontinuation in the 10 mg group than in the pla-
cebo group, suggest tolerability of donepezil in patients
with DLB. The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms,
which are typically observed AEs with ChEI administra-
tion, did not tend to increase in the active groups.
Another expected risk was parkinsonism. Donepezil may
possibly induce or exacerbate extrapyramidal symptoms,
which are threatening for patients with DLB. Although it
is reported with a slightly higher incidence in the 10 mg
group, none of these events were serious, and the UPDRS
part III score did not represent significant deterioration in
each of the active groups. We found no particular
concerns about psychiatric symptoms or arrhythmia.
The interpretation of the present results requires taking
some points into consideration. First, the number of
patients enrolled by each center was generally small
(that is, none by 14 of 72 centers and only 1 by 15 of
the remaining 58), possibly due to DLB’s characteristic
features, including the faster progression, severe psychi-
atric symptoms and greater caregiver burden when
compared to those with AD [4,27-30]. Similar recruitment
difficulties impeded the previous phase II trial and a
placebo-controlled study of rivastigmine in patients with
DLB [31]. This may have caused a flaw in the interrater
reliability of the clinical ratings. However, in this trial, a
training and certification course was mandatory for the
investigators. A second limitation is the short duration
of the RCT phase. The period was set to 12 weeks, 
considering the above-noted disease-specific characteristics
and the result of the previous phase II trial and its exten-
sion. The long-term efficacy of donepezil was evaluated in
the open-label extension phase and is reported in another
paper [13]. Third, because a global measure was not used,
the influence of donepezil administration on the global
clinical status cannot be inferred, despite its clinically
important effect on improvement in cognitive function
demonstrated through evaluation using the MMSE.
Conclusions
The predefined superiority of donepezil over the placebo in
the co–primary endpoints was not confirmed. However,
significant improvement in MMSE score was demonstrated
with 10 mg but not 5 mg. Overall, donepezil was well toler-
ated in patients with DLB. While paying careful attention
to gastrointestinal and parkinsonian symptoms, patients
with DLB can safely benefit from treatment with donepezil.
