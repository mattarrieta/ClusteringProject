REVIEW
Advocacy, education, and the role of not-for-profit
organizations in Lewy body dementias
Angela Taylor1* and Cecilia Yardley2
Abstract
Lewy body dementias (LBDs) represent a spectrum of dementias that are associated with the presence of Lewy
bodies in the brain and that dramatically impact both the person diagnosed and the family caregiver. LBD charities
provide education of the public and health-care professionals, emotional support to families, and advocacy to
policy-makers on the needs of LBD families and advance research. The US-based Lewy Body Dementia Association
and the Lewy Body Society in the UK play an important role in reducing the burden that LBD places on families
and society and provide leadership on issues affecting LBD families. Health-care providers are encouraged to refer
families upon diagnosis to LBD charities as an additional resource to clinical care.
Introduction
Lewy body dementias (LBDs) are related brain disorders
affecting cognition, motor function, mood, behavior, and
autonomic function. Despite being the second most
common form of progressive dementia (10% to 15% of all
dementia cases) [1], LBD is the most misdiagnosed [2] as
onset can present as a psychiatric disorder or Alzheimer’s or
Parkinson’s disease. The Lewy Body Dementia Association
(LBDA) and the Lewy Body Society (LBS) are the only not-
for-profit organizations in the US and Europe, respectively,
that focus exclusively on LBD by disseminating information
and promoting awareness, providing support for people
affected by LBD, advocating on behalf of LBD families,
and funding research.
The term ‘LBD’ covers two related clinical diagnoses
which have similar underlying pathology and symptoms
but which have different patterns of onset. ‘Dementia with
Lewy bodies’  (DLB) is diagnosed when a person de-
velops dementia and any other DLB symptoms before,
or within a year of, developing extrapyramidal symptoms
(bradykinesia, rigidity, or postural instability), with tremor
being a less pronounced feature. Many individuals with
Parkinson’s disease will go on to develop dementia a
year or more after the onset of motor symptoms. This
is diagnosed as ‘Parkinson’s disease dementia’  (PDD).
The diagnostic criteria for DLB and PDD have many

common features. This ‘one-year rule’, though a rather
arbitrary boundary, is useful as a guide during diagno-
sis. The distinction is essential for research purposes,
however, and more studies are needed to better under-
stand the expression of Lewy body spectrum symptoms
over the course of the disease.
In this article, LBD is used to refer to both clinical
diagnoses. DLB or PDD will be used only when referring
to a specific clinical diagnosis. There are approximately
1.3 million people in the US and 140,000 in the UK with
LBD. At least 75% of people with Parkinson’s disease
who survive for more than 10 years will develop demen-
tia [3]. Individuals with LBD can be expected to live 5 to
8 years after diagnosis [4]. Whereas the other articles in
this special series of Alzheimer’s Research & Therapy will
focus on clinical, cognitive, and biomarker characteris-
tics of LBD, this article will focus on the work of two
LBD charities (Box 1).
Education of the public and health-care
professionals
Public understanding of LBD lags dramatically behind
that of diseases that have been in the public eye for decades
longer, such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. Most
individuals with DLB and their families are unaware that
the disorder exists, until diagnosis. Parkinson’s disease
is still viewed by the general public as largely a motor
disorder without cognitive symptoms, although there is
growing recognition among health-care providers of its
non-motor symptoms.

Box 1. Lewy body dementia charities, driven by
experience
The Lewy Body Dementia Association (LBDA) was formed in
2003 by a group of family caregivers in the US and is raising
awareness of Lewy body dementia (LBD) in the public and
health-care community, providing outreach and education to
LBD families, and advancing research. The LBDA’s Scientific
Advisory Council members are leaders in LBD research and
clinical management who provide strategic input to the
LBDA’s programs and services. The LBDA engages its LBD
Community Discussion Panel of caregivers and individuals with
LBD to ensure that its programs and services are designed to meet
the evolving needs of families affected by LBD.
The Lewy Body Society was founded in the UK in 2006 and its
aims are to support research into dementia with Lewy bodies
and to raise awareness and educate the general public, the
medical profession, and relevant decision-makers about all aspects
of the disease. It is the only organization in Europe dedicated to
dementia with Lewy bodies and has strong links with Parkinson’s
UK, a charity advocating on behalf of Parkinson’s disease. Caregiver
support is through provision of information via the website,
written materials, and response to enquiries. The Lewy Body
Society Specialist Advisory Committee consists of 11 medical,
scientific, and legal experts with a special interest in LBD.
An LBDA-sponsored survey of 962 LBD caregivers [5]
found that eight out of 10 cases of LBD are initially di-
agnosed as another condition, most often Alzheimer’s,
a movement disorder like Parkinson’s, or a psychiatric
condition. Lack of an early, accurate diagnosis deprives
people of information that explains disturbing symptoms.
It can also put them at risk of medication side effects.
Up to half of the people with DLB who are treated
with antipsychotic medications display severe sensitiv-
ity. Medications, like haloperidol, that may be used to
control hallucinations in Alzheimer’s disease can have
devastating consequences for someone with LBD, has-
tening disease progression or even causing death.
A definite diagnosis of LBD can only be confirmed
post-mortem. Because of the range of cognitive, behavioral,
movement, and autonomic symptoms, an incomplete
picture of onset symptoms can delay diagnosis. Part of
the problem is the use of inadequate assessment tools,
such as the Mini-Mental State Examination, which is not
sensitive enough to detect cognitive changes in early DLB,
such as fluctuating cognition, visuospatial deficits, or atten-
tion difficulties. LBD charities provide information to help
health-care professionals make earlier, accurate diagnoses,
and campaign for the development and adoption of more
robust diagnostic tools. 
A survey by the LBDA about LBD caregivers’ experience
with clinical care indicates that in the US neurologists make
nearly two thirds of all LBD diagnoses but that primary care
physicians make less than 10% [5]. This indicates a gap in
diagnostic capability between specialists and general practi-
tioners. Many primary care doctors are also unfamiliar with
the complex diagnostic criteria for DLB. The LBD charities
work to raise awareness of LBD among primary care physi-
cians, both directly and through their professional associa-
tions, to encourage them to refer anyone who may have
LBD to a specialist for diagnosis. Information resources
such as the LBDA’s LBD Diagnostic Symptoms Checklist
[6] and the LBS’s new information leaflets [7] can increase
the knowledge and confidence of frontline staff in working
with people with LBD.
Many newly diagnosed people with DLB return to
their primary care doctor for follow-up clinical care
[5]. Continuing professional medical education is vital to
ensure comprehensive treatment. LBD charities urge closer
coordination between clinicians who are treating the same
patient for different LBD symptoms, because managing the
cognitive, motor, and behavioral symptoms of LBD requires
a delicate balance in order to relieve one symptom without
unintentionally or unduly exacerbating another.
Encouragingly, there are signs that more people are re-
ceiving a specific diagnosis of DLB, as ‘In memoriam’
gifts to these condition-specific charities are rising. Both
the LBDA and the LBS are driven, however, by the stark
reality that there is still a long way to go to educate the
public and health-care professionals about the presentation
and impact of this disease. Vital efforts are being made to
inform the public and the health-care profession about LBD
via social media, public service announcements featuring
celebrities, paid advertising, and public relations initiatives.
Outreach and partnership with the Lewy body
dementia community
Lifting the burden on LBD families directly or indirectly
requires commitment to seek a comprehensive understand-
ing of the challenges created by the disease, not only for the
person with the LBD but for the primary caregiver and the
immediate family. This understanding is then used to de-
sign programs and services that ultimately reduce those
challenges (Box 2).
Upon receiving a diagnosis, LBD families face different
pathways to education about the condition and referrals
to resources for advice, support, and community services.
People diagnosed in a specialist dementia or movement
disorders clinic are more likely to receive LBD educational
information and be referred to organizations like the LBDA
and the LBS. UK guidelines for diagnosing dementia make
it most likely that diagnosis will take place in secondary
care. In the US, however, it is most common for people to
be diagnosed by general neurologists and psychiatrists who

Box 2. Lewy Body Dementia Association services
The programs and services of the Lewy Body Dementia
Association (LBDA) reflect its corporate tagline, ‘Increasing
Knowledge, Sharing Experience, Building Hope’ and provide
outreach to families, increase awareness in the public and
health-care profession, and foster research. Family services
include a national network of caregiver support groups, virtual
Lewy body dementia (LBD) communities, and a Caregiver Link
[10] which connects caregivers in the US to volunteers with
experience in caring. Educational activities include free
publications and webinars on LBD and related caring. The LBDA
publishes a monthly e-newsletter reporting on LBD research and
resources for families. The website [11] features news,
educational resources, stories from LBD families, and tools, such as
a Speakers’ Kit, for raising awareness. The LBDA fosters research by
organizing scientific conferences, awarding grants for pilot studies,
and evaluating the impact of LBD on the family caregiver.
Lewy Body Society services
The initiatives of the Lewy Body Society (LBS) embody its
slogan, ‘The more people who know, the fewer people who
suffer’ and its programs center on raising awareness and
promoting and funding research. Information is provided
through written materials and a comprehensive website [12].
Queries are answered by post, email, and telephone, and where
appropriate, referrals are made to other organizations or
agencies. The LBS helpline is answered by nurses with expertise
in dementia through its partnership with Parkinson’s UK. The
LBS sponsors research projects in the genetics of LBD and the
development of new drugs for dementia with Lewy bodies [13]
and is currently seeking to extend its research portfolio.
diagnose and treat patients with a much broader range of
neurological or psychiatric disorders. This reduces the
likelihood of receiving disease-specific information and re-
ferrals. Once diagnosed, most people with LBD return to
primary care for symptom management [5]. This under-
scores the importance of increasing LBD education for
primary care physicians.
Although in some practices doctors refer people to LBD
charities as a valuable add-on to clinical care, most people
find their way to the charities via the internet. Families
come seeking both educational information and emotional
support from LBD charities, whose staff and volunteers are
sometimes the first to answer difficult questions and listen
to distraught caregivers. Calls are often received after the
initial diagnosis and then at varying times of caregiver
stress, including major holidays when extended family
come face to face with heart-breaking signs of disease pro-
gression or caregiver burnout. Both charities make it clear 
that the information they supply is not a substitute for
advice from a trained professional, but by involving
leading experts in the development of information ma-
terials, the charities’  resources are both current and
quality-ensured.
As an adjunct resource to the clinician, the LBDA and
the LBS relieve the strain on the health-care system by
helping people understand LBD and directing them to
other sources of information. They also give hope to LBD
families by providing news about advances in research and
increase self-sufficiency by providing advice on caring and
access to services.
LBD caregivers report medium to high levels of stress
from caring for a person with LBD [8]. Caregiver stress
is associated with the presence of psychosis, daytime sleep,
and cognitive fluctuations, which are common features in
people with DLB and PDD [9]. As LBD progresses, so does
the need to understand medication sensitivities, behavioral
problems, and long-term care requirements. Most care-
givers ask: ‘What does the course of LBD really look like?
What can I expect?’ Becoming part of an established LBD
community provides access to others with experience and
new perspectives about the disease (for example, the impact
on the caregiver (and need for self-care) as well as caregiv-
ing suggestions for the person with LBD). During late-stage
LBD, caregivers often struggle with the emotional realities
and practical decisions about end-of-life issues and they
value the support of others who have had this experience.
LBD organizations can also encourage people affected by
LBD to become active advocates to help raise the profile of
the disease. Families often become frustrated when they
learn that very few people are familiar with LBD, including
many medical professionals. This generates a strong motiv-
ation in some individuals to take action through volunteer-
ism to raise awareness and to serve as a resource for other
LBD families. Being a knowledgeable advocate about LBD
is empowering and helps balance the feeling of powerless-
ness one has against a degenerative disease.
After the death of a person with LBD, the charities can
help families make sense of their experience and draw
positive things from it. Recording the name of the deceased
on an ‘In memoriam’ webpage or in an online forum can
provide solace and community that helps to overcome the
isolation and depletion associated with LBD. Some family
members actively engage with LBD organizations after a
time of grieving. After the devastating impact of LBD on
their lives, others need to close the door on LBD, heal,
recharge, and move on.
Advocacy in action
LBD charities advocate for people who are currently
underserved. People with LBD may be disenfranchised
because of low public awareness, stigma, ageism, insuf-
ficient resources, and the application of the medical

model instead of person-centered solutions. LBD orga-
nizations endeavor to make the issues surrounding and
arising from LBD high on the agendas of relevant re-
searchers, clinicians, industries, government agencies,
and other organizations concerned with the development
and delivery of health-care and social services.
Dementia advocacy within the charity sector has diver-
sified in recent years, as research sheds more light on
how different dementias impact individuals and families.
The LBDA and the LBS engage with other not-for-profit
organizations in advocacy initiatives, acting indepen-
dently of, in parallel with, or in direct collaboration with
related disease-specific groups. LBD charities can partici-
pate effectively in broad alliances calling for more funding
for key governmental agencies or research funding for de-
mentia and movement disorders. However, LBD charities
must also assertively emphasize the distinctive needs of
their beneficiaries (for example, the development of safer
medications to treat behavioral problems in LBD).
LBD charities are increasing their presence among
government bodies, bringing to their attention the
challenges and needs arising from and surrounding
LBD. Those affected by LBD are now being repre-
sented at national and international research strategy
meetings for dementia and Parkinson’s disease. Other
advocacy activities include testifying to drug regula-
tory agencies about the importance of approving drugs
specifically for LBD symptoms, speaking out for early
disability benefits for people with LBD, and support-
ing the development of new psychiatric codes for LBD
in order to improve treatment.
Although LBD charities have been formed in other
countries, including Argentina, Australia, and Japan,
people outside the US and the UK frequently seek in-
formation and support from the LBDA and the LBS be-
cause of the lack of an equivalent organization in their
own countries. More LBD charities are needed around
the globe to advocate on behalf of LBD families and to
increase synergistic opportunities for research advances.
The LBDA and the LBS have served as useful advisors and
resources to emerging LBD charities.
Advancing research
Supporting research is a primary objective for both LBD
charities, as the greatest need of those affected by LBD
is for clinical advances leading to better treatments and
ultimately a cure.
LBD charities place vital donated funds in the hands
of researchers in the form of grant awards. Other research
programs include caregiver research, fellowships, and con-
vening scientific meetings. Collaborations with government
agencies, industry, and related disease charities are impera-
tive to minimize research silos as well as build synergy and
minimize duplication of effort. 
Conclusions
The LBDA and the LBS deliver a wide range of services to
lift the burden of LBD on families and society. By providing
support and promoting awareness, LBD charities reduce
the personal distress experienced by LBD families and may
reduce excessive use of the health system. The LBS and the
LBDA offer resources that enable health-care professionals
to make earlier, accurate diagnoses, and promote better
understanding of the condition among the public, clinical
and care professions, and the many agencies that serve
the LBD community.
Individuals personally touched by LBD and leaders in
relevant fields drive the work of both organizations, and
LBD charities ensure that strategies, programs of re-
search, and services are quality-ensured by LBD experts.
The needs of LBD families evolve as the condition ad-
vances and the charities offer continuity of contact as
individuals move through the health and social care sys-
tem. They also sustain a community of people who
understand the struggles of others affected by LBD. By
offering a range of opportunities to find meaning and
purpose, the charities help people overcome their sense
of powerlessness in the face of a degenerative disease.
Families seeking information and emotional support
currently find their way to the LBDA and the LBS via
the internet, rather than referral from a health or social
care professional. Providers are encouraged to refer fam-
ilies upon diagnosis to LBD charities as an additional re-
source to clinical care.
