Abstract 
Background:  Conserving migratory birds is challenging due to their reliance on multiple distant sites at different
stages of their annual life cycle. The concept of “flyway”, which refers to all areas covered by the breeding, nonbreed‑
ing, and migrating of birds, provides a framework for international cooperation for conservation. In the same flyway, 
however, the migratory activities of the same species can differ substantially between seasons and populations. 
Clarifying the seasonal and population differences in migration is helpful for understanding migration ecology and for
identifying conservation gaps.
Methods:  Using satellite-tracking we tracked the migration of Whimbrels (Numenius phaeopus variegatus) from non‑
breeding sites at Moreton Bay (MB) and Roebuck Bay (RB) in Australia in the East Asian–Australasian Flyway. Mantel
tests were used to analyze the strength of migration connectivity between the nonbreeding and breeding sites of MB
and RB populations. Welch’s t test was used to compare the migration activities between the two populations and
between northward and southward migration.
Results:  During northward migration, migration distance and duration were longer for the MB population than for
the RB population. The distance and duration of the first leg flight during northward migration were longer for the
MB population than for the RB population, suggesting that MB individuals deposited more fuel before departing from
nonbreeding sites to support their longer nonstop flight. The RB population exhibited weaker migration connectivity
(breeding sites dispersing over a range of 60 longitudes) than the MB population (breeding sites concentrating in a
range of 5 longitudes in Far Eastern Russia). Compared with MB population, RB population was more dependent on
the stopover sites in the Yellow Sea and the coastal regions in China, where tidal habitat has suffered dramatic loss. 
However, RB population increased while MB population decreased over the past decades, suggesting that loss of tidal
habitat at stopover sites had less impact on the Whimbrel populations, which can use diverse habitat types. Different
trends between the populations might be due to the different degrees of hunting pressure in their breeding grounds.
Conclusions:  This study highlights that conservation measures can be improved by understanding the full annual
life cycle of movements of multiple populations of Whimbrels and probably other migratory birds.

Background
The annual life cycle of migratory birds depends on dis-
tant breeding, nonbreeding, and stopover sites as well as
the interlinkage shaped by these sites (Newton 2008). The
concept of “flyway”, which refers to all of the areas cov-
ered by breeding, nonbreeding, and migrating of birds, 
provides a framework for international cooperation in
the conservation of migratory birds and their key areas
(Boere and Stroud 2006). Over the past decades, field
surveys have identified many key areas used by migratory
birds, which has facilitated the designation of conserva-
tion hotspots along a flyway (e.g., Bamford et al. 2008).
However, the temporal and spatial patterns of migration
can be quite different between seasons and between pop-
ulations of the same species in the same flyway (e.g., Bat-
tley et al. 2012; Hewson et al. 2016). Understanding the
seasonal and population difference in migration activities
can be helpful for detecting the factors linked with popu-
lation dynamics, for finding conservation gaps, and for
developing targeted conservation measures.
Geographical distribution greatly affects the temporal
and spatial patterns of migratory populations. In general, 
the higher the latitude of the breeding site, the later the
suitable time to initiate breeding (especially for those
species breeding in the Arctic which must wait for snow
melt), and thus the later the birds depart from nonbreed-
ing sites and arrive at breeding sites (Conklin et al. 2013; 
Briedis et al. 2016). With an increase in nonstop flight
distance, birds require a longer time to deposit more fuel
to support migratory flight before departure (Conklin
et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2017). Moreover, migratory routes
are closely linked with the availability and quality of
stopover sites. The quality of stopover sites can affect the
population dynamics of migratory birds. For example, a
decline in the numbers of the Common Cuckoo (Cuculus
canorus) that breed in the UK is related to the use of the
western migration route, which provides low quality hab-
itat (Hewson et al. 2016). In the East Asian–Australasian
Flyway (EAAF),  the rapid population decline of many
migratory shorebirds is related to the dramatic habitat
loss and degradation at their critical stopover sites in the
Yellow Sea (Hua et al. 2015; Piersma et al. 2016; Studds
et al. 2017).
Migration routes and stopover sites can also differ
between the northward and southward migration of the
same population. Weather conditions, especially wind
conditions, influence the seasonal difference in migra-
tion activities (Alerstam et al. 2003).  Because flying
with a tailwind reduces fuel consumption and increases 
migration speed, birds prefer to use migration routes that
provide tailwind assistance, and seasonal differences in
wind direction and strength may therefore greatly affect
migration routes and stopover decisions (e.g., Shamoun-
Baranes et al. 2017; Carneiro et al. 2019).  Migration
can also be affected by the activities after arrival at the
migration destination. Because breeding activities are
time-constrained, migratory birds face great time pres-
sure during migration to their breeding grounds. As a
consequence, for boreal breeding species, birds generally
exhibit shorter stopover durations, and thus faster migra-
tion speeds, during northward than southward migration
(Battley et al. 2012; Nilsson et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2017).
In recent years, many migratory shorebirds in the
EAAF have suffered rapid population decline (Hua et al. 
2015; Piersma et al. 2016; Studds et al. 2017). Clarifying
the full annual life cycle of movements is the basis for
identifying potential causes of these declines and con-
servation gaps. The Whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) is
a long-distance migratory shorebird with a worldwide
distribution. In the EAAF, there are about 65,000 indi-
vidual Whimbrels (Hansen et al. 2016), and these belong
to the subspecies N. p. variegatus (Engelmoer and Rose-
laar 1998). They are mainly distributed in Australia and
Southeast Asia during the nonbreeding period and in
Far Eastern Russia during the breeding period. Roebuck
Bay (RB) in Northwest Australia and Moreton Bay (MB) 
in East Australia are two major nonbreeding sites for the
Whimbrels (Bamford et al. 2008; Rogers et al. 2011; Wil-
son et al. 2011). Since the 1990s, Whimbrels numbers
have declined at MB (Wilson et al. 2011) but increased
at RB (Rogers et al. 2019). The causes for these different
population trends are unclear (Conklin et al. 2014).
Field surveys have revealed seasonal differences in
numbers of Whimbrels at stopover sites along the EAAF. 
Many birds stopover in the Yellow Sea region during
northward migration (Barter 2002; Bamford et al. 2008) 
but mainly stopover on the coasts of the Kamchatka Pen-
insula (Gerasimov et al. 2018), south China (Carey et al. 
2001; Bai et al. 2015), Indonesia (Eaton et al. 2016) and
Papua New Guinea (Bishop 2006) during southward
migration (Conklin et al. 2014).  However, few surveys
were conducted on southward migration (Choi et al. 
2016).  Shorebird banding and flag resightings (Min-
ton et al. 2006) indicate that the migration route used
by the Whimbrels may be more eastward during south-
ward than northward migration, i.e., more birds migrat-
ing south use the Kamchatka Peninsula rather than the
Yellow Sea region as a stopover site (Minton et al. 2006).

However, not many Whimbrels were flagged and these
flagged birds mainly came from nonbreeding sites in
East Australia. Moreover, few flagged birds were recov-
ered due to lack of people looking for flags. The annual
life cycle of Whimbrels in the EAAF therefore remains
unclear.
The rapid development of bio-tracking technology
facilitates the identification of the migration routes, key
stopover sites, and migration connectivity of migratory
birds. In this study, we tracked the nonbreeding Whim-
brel populations at MB and RB to identify their breeding
sites and stopover sites, and compare their seasonal and
population differences in migration activities. We com-
pare their migration with those of Whimbrels in the East
Atlantic Flyway and the Americas Flyway, and we also
discuss the potential causes of the differences in migra-
tory activities.
Methods
Bird capture and tagging
Whimbrels were captured using cannon nets at high tide
in MB and RB by the Queensland Wader Study Group
(QWSG)/the Australasian Wader Studies Group (AWSG) 
respectively in the nonbreeding seasons of 2017‒2018. 
These were part of the banding programs of the Aus-
tralasian Wader Studies Group (RB) and the Queensland
Wader Study Group (MB). At MB, five birds were tagged
with 5-g solar Platform Terminal Transmitters (PTTs, 
Microwave Telemetry, Inc., Columbia, Maryland, US) in
November 2017. In February 2018 at RB, five birds were
tagged with 5-g PTTs and 11 birds were tagged with
7-g solar Global Positioning System–Global System for
Mobile Communication tags (GPS–GSMs, Hunan Global
Messenger Technology Co.,  Ltd.,  Hunan, China).  Tags
were attached to the lower back of birds with leg-looped
harnesses (Kuang et al. 2019). All of the tagged individu-
als were adults based on plumage characters (Prater et al. 
1977). Relative to the body mass of the individual cap-
tured Whimbrels, the tag weight ranged from 1.1 to 2.0%.
The PTT duty cycle was set to 10 h on/48 h off. GPS–
GSM tags were programed to make one record of loca-
tion (fix) at 2–6 h intervals. Only the fixes with high
positioning accuracy (error < 500 m for PTTs and < 100 m
for GPS–GSM tags) were included in this study.
Data processing
All of the tagged Whimbrels initially remained near the
capture site after release. We assumed that the birds
had initiated their northward migration when they flew
northward more than 50 km from the capture sites
and did not return. We assumed that birds had arrived
at the breeding site when they no longer moved north-
ward and when two successive fixes were less than 50 km 
apart. Similarly, we assumed that birds had initiated their
southward migration when they flew southward more
than 50 km from the breeding sites and did not return. 
During migration, sites where birds remained within
0.5 degree of latitude for more than 48 h and where two
successive fixes were less than 50 km apart were consid-
ered to be stopover sites. The geographical location of
the nonbreeding site, stopover site, and breeding site for
each individual was the arithmetic mean of all of the geo-
graphical coordinates at each site (Giunchi et al. 2019).
Migration distance was calculated as the accumulation of
the great circle distance between the nonbreeding, suc-
cessive stopover, and breeding sites.
Departure time from and arrival time at the nonbreed-
ing, stopover, and breeding sites was estimated for each
individual bird. If the time interval between two consecu-
tive fixes before and after departure from the site did not
exceed 24 h, the last record at the site was used as the
departure time. If the time interval between two con-
secutive fixes before and after arrival at the site did not
exceed 24 h, the first record at the site was used as the
arrival time. If the time interval between two consecu-
tive fixes of departure from or arrival at the site exceeded
24 h, the departure time was calculated as the average
time between the last fix at the site and the next fix after
departure from the site, and the arrival time was calcu-
lated as the average time between the first fix at the site
and the previous fix before arrival at the site (Giunchi
et al. 2019).
Migration duration was calculated as the period from
start to finish of the migratory flight. Stopover duration
was the period between arrival at and departure from
the stopover site. Overall stopover duration for each bird
was the sum of all stopover durations during migration. 
Travel duration was calculated as the difference between
the migration duration and the overall stopover duration. 
Migration speed was calculated as the migration distance
divided by the corresponding migration duration. Travel
speed was calculated as the migration distance divided by
the travel duration.
Birds do not generally fly along the shortest path
between the nonbreeding and breeding site. We calcu-
lated the detour index of migration route by dividing the
great circle distance between nonbreeding and breed-
ing site by the actual migration distance. Long-distance
migratory birds deposit some amount of fuel before the
first leg of the migratory flight (Zhao et al. 2017). Gener-
ally, birds flying a longer distance require to store more
fuel prior to initiate migratory flight (Lindström 2020).
To detect the contribution of the pre-migration fuel store
to first migratory flight, we calculated the distance and
duration of the first leg flight after departure from non-
breeding and breeding sites.

Data analysis
Of the 21 tagged Whimbrels, eight completed both the
northward and southward migration (three from MB and
five from RB), and another two from RB completed the
northward but not the southward migration. Individuals
failed to track were due to equipment failure or death of
birds. For example, four birds with tags were resighted
in the field but no data received, and one bird was killed
in Yakut, Russia by local hunter, and two birds were lost
when encountering typhoon in the East China Sea. We
analyzed migration data from birds that completed at
least a single trip, including 10 birds (7 with PTTs and 3
with GPS–GSMs) that completed northward migration
and 8 birds (7 with PTTs and 1 with GPS–GSMs) that
completed southward migration. Mantel tests were used
to analyze the strength of migration connectivity between
the nonbreeding and breeding sites of the two popu-
lations (Ambrosini et al. 2009).  The pairwise distance
matrix for each of the two populations was established
based on the geographical location of the nonbreeding
and breeding sites for each individual (Ambrosini et al. 
2009). The distance matrix included all individuals that
arrived at the breeding site during northward migration
(seven individuals from RB and three individuals from
MB). Distance between individuals was calculated as the
great circle distance. The “ADE4” package in R was used
to calculate the Mantel correlation coefficient (rM
) for
each population (Dray and Dufour 2007). The larger the
coefficient, the stronger the migration connectivity.
A two-tailed Welch t-test was used to compare the
migration activities of the RB and MB population in the
same season. We calculated the logarithm of the sea-
sonal ratio of migration speed, overall stopover duration, 
and travel speed for each individual in order to compare
the seasonal difference in migration activities (Nilsson
et al. 2013; Schmaljohann 2018). Linear mixed models
(LMMs) were used to analyze the effect of travel speed
and overall stopover duration on the seasonal difference
in migration speed, with individual as a random variable. 
All statistical analyses were conducted with R software (R
Core Team 2018), and results are reported as mean ± SD.
Results
Migration routes and stopover sites
During their northward migration, Whimbrels from
the same nonbreeding site followed a similar migration
route for their first leg of flights after departure (Fig. 1a, 
b).  The seven tagged birds from RB (Northwest Aus-
tralia) flew over Southeast Asia to stopover sites on the
south China coast, and then moved northward along the
coast to the Yellow Sea region (Fig. 1a). The three tagged
birds from MB (East Australia) flew over the Western 
Pacific to stopover sites on the Japan or Yellow Sea coast
(Fig. 1b). The first leg flight from RB was 4791 ± 222 km, 
which represented 44% of the total northward migra-
tion distance (11,018 km). The first leg flight from MB
was 7121 ± 412 km, which represented 55% of the total
northward migration distance (12,991 km).  Both the
flight distance and duration were significantly longer
(t = 9.23, df = 2.52 and p = 0.006 for flight distance; 
t = 2.38, df = 3.65 and p = 0.04 for duration) from MB
than from RB (Table 1). The seven birds from RB flew dif-
ferent migration routes after departure from the Yellow
Sea region, and their breeding sites were dispersed over
a large region in Far Eastern Russia, i.e., from 105.1° to
173.3° E (Fig. 1a). In contrast, the three birds from MB
flew a similar migration route and their breeding sites
were concentrated in the east of Far Eastern Russia, from
167.7°–172.3° E (Fig. 1b). The migration connectivity (rM
)
was 0.39 and 0.99 for birds from RB and MB, respectively. 
During southward migration, six of the seven birds
from RB followed migration routes that were similar to
their northward migration routes and stayed at one or
more stopover sites in mainland China; in contrast, one
of the seven RB birds, which had a breeding ground at
the east of Far Eastern Russia, flew across the Western
Pacific to Bismarck Archipelago and then returned to RB
(Fig. 1c). Of the three birds from MB, one stopped over in
the Yellow Sea, and two flew across the Western Pacific
from the Kamchatka Peninsula to Bismarck Archipelago. 
All three flew back to MB after a stopover at Papua New
Guinea (Fig. 1d).  The first leg flight of the southward
migration was 1292 and 2182 km for birds from MB
and RB, respectively; these distances represented about
10% of the total migration distance for each population
(Table 1).
None of the tagged birds paused their migration in
Southeast Asia during their northward migration. The
main stopover sites were located along the coast of China
and Northeast Asia. Nine of the 10 tagged birds stopped
over in the Yellow Sea region and the other one stopped
over in Japan (Fig. 1a, b). During southward migration, 
most birds from the RB stopped over in the coastal region
of China including the Yellow Sea region and South-
east Asia, except for the one RB bird that bred in the
east of Far Eastern Russia (Fig. 1c). All three birds from
MB, however, stopped over in Kamchatka and eastern
Papua New Guinea/Bismarck Archipelago, but only one
used the Yellow Sea and none used Southeast Asia as a
stopover site (Fig. 1d). Birds stopped over one more time
during southward (4.0 ± 1.2 times) than the northward
(2.7 ± 1.3 times) migration (two populations combined).
Migration routes of the Whimbrels breeding in the
East of Far Eastern Russia were further east and shorter
during southward than the northward migration. All four

birds used stopover sites in the Yellow Sea and adjacent
region (Japan) during their northward migration, but
three of the four birds took a shorter migration route, fly-
ing across the Western Pacific without a stopover in Asia
during their southward migration.
A total of 67 stopover sites used by Whimbrels were
identified in this study, including 29 sites during north-
ward migration and 38 sites during southward migration. 
During northward migration, stopover sites mainly con-
centrated in the Yellow Sea and the South China while
during south migration, stopover sites were dispersed
along migration routes including southeast Asian where
birds did not stopover during northward migration
(Fig. 1, Additional file 1: Table S1).
Migration timing and stopover duration
During northward migration, there was no significant
difference between the two populations in the departure
date from nonbreeding sites (t = 1.01, df = 2.81, p = 0.39) 
or arrival date at breeding sites (t = 0.90, df = 6.78, 
p = 0.40).  The migration distance was nearly 2000 km
longer for birds from MB than for birds from RB (t = 2.51, 
df = 7.97, p = 0.04), but migration duration did not sig-
nificantly differ between the two populations (t = 1.08, 
df = 7.014, p = 0.32). The detour index was slightly lower
(t = 1.94, df = 7.68, p = 0.05) for birds from MB than for
birds from RB. The overall migration speed was similar
(t = 0.07, df = 5.34, p = 0.94) between the two populations
(Table 1).
During southward migration, the two populations did
not significantly differ in the departure date from the 
breeding sites (t = 0.78, df = 7.83 and p = 0.46) or the
arrival date at the nonbreeding sites (t = 0.18, df = 4.67
and p = 0.87) (Table 1). Migration distance was about
1000 km longer for birds from MB than from RB, but
migration duration did not significantly differ (t = 0.57, 
df = 4.48, p = 0.60) between the two populations. The
detour index and overall migration speed were similar
(t = 1.51, df = 5.07, p = 0.19) for the two populations
(Table 1).
During northward migration, the overall stopover
duration was longer (t = 2.84, df = 7.37, p = 0.01) for
birds from MB than for birds from RB. Two of three
birds from MB and six of seven birds from RB stopped
over in the Yellow Sea region. Both stopover duration
(t = 0.32, df = 2.78, p = 0.77) and percentage of the
overall stopover duration (t = 0.06, df = 3.08, p = 0.95) 
in the Yellow Sea region were similar between the MB
and RB birds (Fig. 1, Table 1).
During southward migration, the overall stopo-
ver duration was similar (t = 0.63, df = 4.58, p = 0.56) 
for birds from MB and RB. Four of the seven birds
from RB stopped over in the Yellow Sea region for
35.5 ± 16.1 days, which accounted for 52.6 ± 29.3% of
the overall stopover duration. The other three birds did
not stopover in the Yellow Sea region. One of the three
birds from MB stopped over in the Yellow Sea region; 
that bird remained at stopover sites for 33.5 days, 
which accounted for 53.3% of its overall stopover
duration (Fig. 1, Table 1). None of the three MB birds
stopped over in the coastal region of China while the
Page 7
Kuang   et al. Avian Res (2020) 11:24  Page 7 of 12
RB birds stopped over for 28.8 ± 18.0 days, accounting
for 48.2 ± 34.4% of the overall stopover duration.
Seasonal difference in migration activity
The overall migration speed of birds was faster (t = 9.51, 
df = 14.78, p < 0.001) during northward migration than
during southward migration (Table 1). This was mainly
due to the shorter migration duration and stopover dura-
tion during northward migration than during south-
ward migration (Additional file 1: Table S2). There was
no significant difference in migration distance (t = 0.37, 
df = 14.26, p = 0.72) or detour index (t = 0.55, df = 12.51, 
p = 0.59) between the northward migration and the
southward migration (Table 1).
Discussion
This study provided new information on the migration of
Whimbrels from two nonbreeding sites (RB and MB) in
the EAAF. The dates for the start and end of the migra-
tion were similar for the two populations in both seasons, 
perhaps because the latitudes of breeding sites are similar
for the two populations. Migration routes, stopover sites, 
and stopover duration, however, differed between the
populations and between seasons. Moreover, the migra-
tion connectivity between nonbreeding and breeding
sites was strong for the MB population (all birds nested
in a narrow longitudinal band in Far East Siberia) but
weak for the RB population (birds nested across a broad
band spanning ~ 60 degrees of longitude). Seasonal and
population differences in migration highlight the impor-
tance of identifying the full annual movements of multi-
ple populations of the same species in the same flyway.
Migration of Whimbrels in the EAAF
Using band recovery and flag resighting data, Minton
et al. (2006) suggested that, unlike most shorebirds in the
EAAF that pass through the coasts of the Asian main-
land during their northward migration, Whimbrels take
an eastward migration route and their main stopover
sites are located in the Kamchatka region of Far East-
ern Russia and Japan. Field surveys also have indicated
the importance of Kamchatka for Whimbrels on both
northward (Lappo et al. 2012) and southward (Gerasi-
mov et al. 2018) migration. This is consistent with our
tracking results for Whimbrels from MB (located in East
Australia) but inconsistent with our tracking results for
Whimbrels from RB (located in Northwest Australia). It
is not surprising because most of the banded and flagged
Whimbrels were from East Australia (Minton et al. 2006).
In the current study, we found that unlike the Whimbrels
from MB, Whimbrels from RB depend on the stopover
sites along the coasts of the Asian mainland during both
their northward and southward migration. Actually, of 
the two recovered birds that originate from RB, one was
recovered in the south Yellow Sea (Minton et al. 2006).
As a consequence, the inconsistence might be due to
relatively few birds being flagged in RB and lack of peo-
ple looking for flagged birds along the coasts of the Asian
mainland at the study period (Ma et al. 2013a). Results
from our tracking study support speculation by Min-
ton et al. (2006) that “there is only one report from the
Yellow Sea in China but… this under-reflects the true
importance of the Yellow Sea as a migratory stopover
for this species”. Moreover, Minton et al. (2006) exhib-
ited that all the breeding region of Whimbrels in Aus-
tralia is related to Anadyr region in Far Eastern Russia. 
Our tracking study identified two new breeding regions
(central-northern Sakha and eastern Krasnoyarskiy Kray) 
for Whimbrels in RB. These breeding regions fit well with
the breeding distribution shown by Lappo et al. (2012).
We found that, during their northward migration, the
Whimbrels that breed in the east of Far Eastern Rus-
sia tend to veer or “detour” westward to the Yellow Sea
region (Fig. 1b). This has been found in several species
that spend the non-breeding season in eastern Australia
or New Zealand, such as the Grey-tailed Tattler (Tringa
brevipes,  Coleman et al. 2018),  the Ruddy Turnstone
(Arenaria interpres,  Minton et al. 2011),  and the Bar-
tailed Godwit (Limosa lapponica baueri,  Battley et al. 
2012). The “detours” may be related to the use of stopover
sites in the Yellow Sea region for fuel deposition. Suitable
breeding period is short for shorebirds breeding at high
latitudes; arriving at breeding sites in good condition is
therefore important so that breeding can be quickly ini-
tiated. Many studies have indicated that shorebirds in
the Yellow Sea region during their northward migration
deposit huge amounts of fuel that can be used for both
the migratory flight and activities at breeding sites (e.g.,
Hua et al. 2013; Ma et al. 2013b). During their southward
migration, in contrast, birds can restore their body condi-
tion after arriving at nonbreeding sites.
Whimbrels from Australia are believed to breed mainly
in Far Eastern Russia (Barter 2002; Bamford et al. 2008).
However, the migration connectivity between nonbreed-
ing and breeding populations is still unclear. Although
sample sizes were small, this study showed that the
Whimbrels from MB breed in a relatively small region
in the southeast of Chukchi, while the breeding areas of
the Whimbrels from RB are more widely distributed in
Far Eastern Russia. This indicates that the migration con-
nectivity is stronger for Whimbrels from MB than from
RB. All eight individuals that were successfully tracked
for their round-trip migration returned to the nonbreed-
ing sites in the previous year, suggesting that Whimbrels
exhibit high fidelity to their nonbreeding sites. Further
analysis of the genetic traits of birds at various breeding
Page 8
Kuang et al. Avian Res (2020) 11:24  Page 8 of 12
and nonbreeding sites should help clarify the migration
connectivity and gene flow in the flyway.
N. p. variegatus was considered to be the only subspe-
cies in the EAAF with breeding at the east of Far East-
ern Russia (Bamford et al. 2008; Conklin et al. 2014). In
this study, the breeding grounds of most tracked birds
match the breeding range of variegatus but new breed-
ing regions (central-northern Sakha and eastern Krasno-
yarskiy Kray) were identified for RB birds. These regions
have been suggested to be the overlap zone of subspecies
phaeopus and variegatus (Engelmoer and Roselaar 1998) 
and the nature of intergradation is unclear. Although
our tracking results cannot identify whether there is
intergradation between the two subspecies and whether
phaeopus and variegatus might even be different species
(Livezey 2010), we found RB Whimbrels have a wide-
spread breeding region in Far Eastern Russia. Combining
with migratory tracking, comparison on the morphologi-
cal and genetic traits of birds at both breeding and non-
breeding sites will help to clarify the issue in taxonomy.
We detected obvious seasonal difference in the use of
stopover sites. During northward migration, birds took a
long-distance, nonstop flight after departing from non-
breeding sites, and their stopover sites were therefore
concentrated in the second half of their migratory jour-
ney, i.e., along the coasts of China, Japan, and the Yellow
Sea region. During southward migration, stopover sites
were widely distributed on the Kamchatka Peninsula, 
the Yellow Sea region, and the coasts of China, southeast
Asia, and Papua New Guinea and the Bismarck Archi-
pelago (Fig. 1c, d).  This is consistent with the results
from field surveys (Barter 2002; Hadden 2004; Bishop
2006; Bamford et al. 2008; Bai et al. 2015) and reported
in McClure (1974).  Our tracking results confirm field
observations by Gerasimov et al. (2018), for Whimbrels
that breed in East Siberia, the Kamchatka Peninsula is
an important gathering site during southward migra-
tion before their cross-sea southward flight. Our track-
ing results also indicated that the Kamchatka Peninsula
was less used during the northern migration. Field sur-
veys have reported that about 51% (Gerasimov et al. 
2018) to 91% (Schuckard et al. 2006) of the Whimbrels
in the EAAF stopped over on the Kamchatka Peninsula
during southward migration, which is much more than
birds recorded during northward migration, although a
large number of birds also can be recorded on northward
migration (Lappo et al. 2012).
Most of stopover sites the Whimbrels used in this study
have been identified as the sites of international impor-
tance (Bamford et al. 2008; Conklin et al. 2014) but some
new recognized sites have not yet (Additional file 1: 
Table S1). During northward migration, the newly rec-
ognized sites were concentrated in the south coast and 
the northeast of China, where RB birds did stopover at. 
During southward migration, the newly recognized sites
were concentrated in the southwest coast of Kamchatka, 
Papua New Guinea and Bismarck Archipelago, south
coast of China, and Sulawesi in Indonesia (Additional
file 1: Table S1).  Although large flocks of Whimbrels
have been reported in the southeast Asia on southward
migration and nonbreeding period (Conklin et al. 2016),
the detailed sites recorded by our tracking are different
from former records. Field surveys in these regions are
required to clarify the importance of these sites for the
Whimbrels and other shorebirds.
The first leg of the migratory flight during north-
ward migration is far for both MB and RB populations, 
i.e., the leg covers about half of the total migration dis-
tance. This is also the case for some other shorebirds that
spend the nonbreeding period in Oceania and that breed
in the Arctic and subarctic (Additional file 1: Table S3).
Fuel deposition rate of shorebirds is relatively low at
low latitudes where there is less food (macrobenthos on
tideland) than at high latitudes (Piersma et al. 2004). To
improve their fuel deposition rate, shorebirds can take a
long-distance, nonstop flight to “jump over” the low lati-
tudes (Piersma et al. 2004; Aharon-Rotman et al. 2016).
This requires high-quality habitats with abundant food to
support rapid fuel deposition pre-migration at nonbreed-
ing sites. During their northward migration, birds from
MB exhibited longer first leg flights than birds from RB, 
suggesting that birds from MB deposit more fuel than
birds from RB before the onset of migration. This infer-
ence is supported by the body mass data at the two sites: 
there was no significant difference in body mass between
the two populations from October to December; while
at pre-migration period in March, body mass of the
Whimbrels at MB was significantly higher than that at RB
(Additional file 2: Figure S1). We therefore suggest that
high quality habitats at nonbreeding sites are important
for long-distance migration.
We found RB population intensively used China’s coast
including the Yellow Sea during both northward and
southward migration, while MB population less used
during southward migration. This is similar to the migra-
tion of Bar-tailed Godwits in the EAAF: menzbieri God-
wits (mainly stay in Northwest Australia in nonbreeding
season) use the Yellow Sea on both migrations while
baueri Godwits (mainly stay in New Zealand and East
Australia in nonbreeding season) use the Yellow Sea only
on northward migration (Battley et al. 2012). Menzbieri 
population suffered more rapid decline than baueri pop-
ulation; this is likely due to their different dependence
on the stopover sites in the Yellow Sea, where the criti-
cal tidal habitats suffered dramatic loss over the past sev-
eral decades (Conklin et al. 2016). However, Whimbrel
Page 9
Kuang   et al. Avian Res (2020) 11:24  Page 9 of 12
populations have declined at MB (Wilson et al. 2011) but
increased at RB in the recent few decades (Rogers et al. 
2019). This is the opposite of the situation of Godwits. 
This may be because the Whimbrels can use a variety
of habitat types (including widely distributed farmland
and shrub) during migration (Kuang et al. 2019), thus
tidal habitat loss along China’s coast had limited impact
on the Whimbrels. Recent study indicated that huge
numbers of Whimbrels were killed by local hunters in
Kamchatka (37,000 birds per year, Khlokov et al. 2020),
suggesting MB birds that breed in the east of Far East-
ern Russia suffered serious hunting pressure. Further
studies on the survival rates at different periods and sites
in the full annual life cycle (e.g., Piersma et al. 2016) are
important to clarify the different trends between the two
populations.
Migration of Whimbrels in different flyways
Recent studies have indicated that Whimbrels that breed
in North America and Iceland use only a limited num-
ber of stopover sites during migration. They generally
make one stopover during their northward migration, 
and Icelandic Whimbrels can fly directly from the breed-
ing to nonbreeding site during their southward migra-
tion (Alves et al. 2016; Johnson et al. 2016; Carneiro
et al. 2019, Additional file 1: Table S4). Whimbrels in the
EAAF, in contrast, stopover for an average of three and
four times during their northward and southward migra-
tion, respectively. This might be related to the longer
migration distances of the Whimbrels in the EAAF
(11,000 and 13,000 km for birds from MB and RB, respec-
tively) than in the other two flyways (9800 and 6700 km
for birds in North America and Iceland, respectively, 
Additional file 1: Table S4). Wind conditions (tailwinds
or headwinds) in different regions can also affect stopo-
ver decisions during migration (Alerstam et al. 2003; Ma
et al. 2011; Carneiro et al. 2019). Whimbrels that breed
in Iceland and North America are likely to obtain wind
assistance (Alves et al. 2016; Johnson et al. 2016; Carneiro
et al. 2019) while birds in the EAAF might encounter
unfavorable tailwinds near the equator (Wang et al. 2020) 
and in the south hemisphere during southward migration
(Gill et al. 2014). The adverse wind condition can increase
the possibility of stopover of birds during migratory flight
(Ma et al. 2011).
Because the fuel deposition rate at stopover sites
is much slower than the fuel consumption rate dur-
ing flight, stopover duration is much longer than the
duration of migratory flight, and thus migration speed
is mainly determined by stopover duration (Kölzsch
et al. 2016; Schmaljohann 2018). In the EAAF, Whim-
brels have shorter stopover durations and thus faster 
migration speeds during their northward than their
southward migration. This is consistent with results
obtained for most migratory birds and is related to the
time pressure for early arrival at breeding sties dur-
ing northward migration (Newton 2008; Nilsson et al. 
2013).  Whimbrels that breed in Iceland and North
America, however, have a shorter stopover duration
and thus a faster migration speed during their south-
ward than northward migration (Alves et al. 2016; 
Johnson et al. 2016; Carneiro et al. 2019, Additional
file 1: Table S4). It is likely that Whimbrels that breed
in Iceland and North America have a greater chance of
obtaining tailwind assistance during their southward
than northward migration. This benefits the migratory
flights from breeding to nonbreeding sites (Alves et al. 
2016; Johnson et al. 2016; Carneiro et al. 2019). The rel-
atively short migration distance of Whimbrels breeding
in Iceland also enables those birds to make a nonstop
flight from the breeding to the nonbreeding site.
In response to the narrow breeding time window
at high latitudes, some birds adopt a capital breeding
strategy, i.e., they deposit nutrients that form the eggs
before arriving at breeding sites (Hobson and Jehl 2010) 
and can therefore lay eggs soon after arriving at breed-
ing sites. Capital breeders generally have a relatively
long stopover duration en route (especially at final pre-
breeding stopover sites), which enables them to deposit
more fuel than required for the migratory flight (Hua
et al. 2013). Whimbrels that breed in North America at
least partially adopt a capital breeding strategy (Hob-
son and Jehl 2010). They spend 64 days at the breeding
site and 34 days at stopover sites during their north-
ward migration, and there is only an 11-day interval
between arriving at the breeding site and laying eggs
(Johnson et al. 2016).  In contrast, Whimbrels that
breed in Iceland tend to be income breeders (Carneiro
et al. 2019). They have a short stopover duration dur-
ing their northward migration (12 days), remain for a
long period at the breeding site (95 days), and exhibit a
long interval between arriving at the breeding site and
laying eggs (22 days) (Carneiro et al. 2019). The cur-
rent study indicates that Whimbrels in the EAAF have
an average stopover duration of 26 days during north-
ward migration and remain at the breeding site for
59 days (Table 1, Additional file 1: Table S4), which is
similar to the Whimbrels in North America. As a con-
sequence, we speculate that Whimbrels in the EAAF
at least partially adopt a capital breeding strategy and
that the conservation of key stopover sites that enable
fuel deposition en route is critical for their population
maintenance.

Conclusions
This study identified the migration routes and breeding
areas as well as revealed the migration activities of two
Whimbrel populations in the EAAF. We found there are
obvious seasonal and population differences in migra-
tion activities within the EAAF and among flyways. This
might be related to the different environmental condi-
tions among populations, such as geographical distribu-
tion of breeding and nonbreeding sites, characteristics
of migration routes and stopover sites, as well as weather
conditions during migration. Environmental condi-
tions shape the migration performance of migratory
birds, which is also closely related to their physiologi-
cal and ecological traits during migration as well as pre- 
and post-migration. We highlight that clarifying the full
annual life cycle of movements of multiple populations
is the basis for understanding the adaption to migratory
life and for making conservation measures to migra-
tory birds. In addition, many studies have highlighted
the impact of habitat loss and degradation at stopover
sites on migratory shorebirds along the EAAF (e.g., Mel-
ville et al. 2016; Piersma et al. 2016; Studds et al. 2017).
Results of this study suggest that hunting pressure in
breeding sites might be an important but neglected cause
of population decline.
