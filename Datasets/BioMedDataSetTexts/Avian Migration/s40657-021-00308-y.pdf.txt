Abstract 
Background:  The Swan Goose (Anser cygnoides) breeds across Mongolia and adjacent China and Russia and winters
exclusively in China. It is globally threatened, showing long-term major range contractions and declining abundance, 
linked to habitat loss and degradation. We remain ignorant about the biogeographical subpopulation structure of the
species and potential differences in their migration timing, stopovers and schedules, information that could be vital
to effective conservation of different elements of the species population, which we address here with results from a
telemetry study.
Methods:  In 2017–2018, we attached GPS/GSM telemetry devices to 238 Swan Geese on moulting sites in three
discrete parts of their summering area (Dauria International Protected Area, Central Mongolia and Western Mongolia),
generating 104 complete spring and autumn migration episodes to compare migration speed and nature between
birds of different summer provenances.
Results:  Birds from all three breeding areas used almost completely separate migration routes to winter sympatrically
in the Yangtze River floodplain. Although many features of the spring and autumn migrations of the three groups
were similar, despite the significantly longer migration routes taken by Western Mongolian tagged birds, birds from
Dauria Region arrived significantly later in winter due to prolonged staging in coastal areas and took longer to reach
their breeding areas in spring. Among birds of all breeding provenances, spring migration was approximately twice as
fast as autumn migration. Areas used by staging Swan Geese (mainly wetlands) in autumn and spring almost never
fell within national level protected areas, suggesting major site safeguard is necessary to protect these critical areas.
Conclusions:  This study showed the discreteness of migration routes taken by birds of different summer prov-
enances and differences in their migratory patterns, highlighting key staging areas (Yalu River Estuary in China/North
Korea for Dauria Region breeding birds, Daihai Lake for Central Mongolian and Ordos Basin for Western Mongolian
birds). Based on this new knowledge of the biogeographical subpopulation structure of the Swan Goose, we need to

Background
The Swan Geese (Anser cygnoides) is an endemic East
Asian species listed by IUCN as Vulnerable, which now
breeds mainly in Mongolia and adjacent areas of Russia
and China and migrates to winter almost exclusively in
China (Batbayar et al. 2011; An et al. 2018; Damba et al. 
2020). The species has shown long-term major contrac-
tions of breeding and wintering range as well as recent
continued declines in abundance (Fox and Leafloor 2018; 
Damba et al. 2020). These are thought to be linked to hab-
itat loss and degradation due to human activities through
climate change, agriculture, aquaculture and urbani-
zation, as well as the direct effects of hunting (Gom-
bobaatar and Monks 2011; BirdLife International 2018; 
Chen et al. 2019). Survival rates of neck-collared telem-
etry tagged Swan Geese revealed low autumn survival
rates, especially among juveniles (Choi et al. 2016), but
we still remain ignorant about the biogeographical sub-
population structure of the species and potential differ-
ences in their migration timing, stopovers and schedules, 
information that could be vital to effective conservation
of different elements of the species population.
In this study, we report, compare and contrast the find-
ings from telemetry results from Swan Geese fitted with
GPS/GSM transmitter collars marked in three different
core breeding areas in Mongolian plateau. In particular, 
we wished to compare and contrast (1) migration routes, 
(2) migration parameters and (3) stopover sites used by
Swan Geese from the three breeding areas in autumn
and spring to contribute and improve the efforts for their
effective conservation.
Methods
Tracking geese marked with GPS/GSM transmitters
Swan Geese breed across all of Mongolia, but are most
concentrated into three core areas by the availability
of wetlands, separated by arid landscapes with more
restricted nesting habitat. In this study, we attempted
to mark birds from each of these three discrete areas to
compare their migration patterns and levels of protec-
tion. In Western Mongolia, Swan Geese breed in large
lakes located in the semi-desert region of the Great Lakes
Depression, where the annual temperature range is high-
est and it is significantly warmer and drier during the
breeding season. Swan Geese breeding in Central Mon-
golia nest on lakes and along rivers located in the short 
grass steppe biome set among middle elevation roll-
ing hills, where annual precipitation is higher than the
other capture regions. Swan Geese in the Dauria region, 
in Eastern Mongolia, breed in lakes and river valleys
located on more flat steppe areas generally surrounded
by tall grass steppe habitat, which experiences the mild-
est climate compared to the other two areas (Batchuluun
and Dash 2020). There are estimated 600 moulting Swan
Geese at Aireg Lake and Uws Lake, which are the major
breeding areas in Western Mongolia; estimated 3000
moulting birds at Ugii Lake, which is the largest moult-
ing concentration in Central Mongolia; estimated 25,000
moulting birds in the Dauria region and Eastern Mongo-
lia (Fox and Leafloor 2018). The capture areas were 700–
1000 km separate from each other (Fig. 1).
In three different parts of the breeding area, flightless
moulting Swan Geese were captured by herding them
up using boats and kayaks and pushing them onto land
into funnel drive-traps (Bub 1991). In Western Mongo-
lia, two geese were marked with 35 g GPS/GSM trans-
mitters manufactured by Druid Technology, China at
Uws Lake (50.4° N, 93.1° E) in July 2017, three marked
with 44 g transmitters manufactured by Ornitela, UAB
at Uws Lake and eight with 44 g Ornitela transmitters
at Taigan Lake (46.4° N, 97.4° E) in July 2018. In Central
Mongolia, 25 geese were marked with 35 g Druid trans-
mitters at Ugii Lake (47.8° N, 102.7° E) in July 2017. In
Dauria International Protected Area (47.7° N, 117.5° E),
200 geese were marked with 35 g Druid transmitters in
July 2017. All these GPS/GSM transmitters were neck
collar-mounted and constituted less than 1.2% to Swan
Geese body mass to minimize the impact on their behav-
iour and ecology (Millspaugh and Marzluff 2001; Bodey
et al. 2018). Devices attached in 2017 and 2018 were set
to record the GPS locations at 1 h and 10 min intervals, 
respectively, throughout the research project. Bench tests
prior to deployment confirmed the horizontal accuracy
of transmitters as 9.6 m (SD =  ± 5.6 m).
Data from tracked geese contributed 104 completed
autumn and spring migration episodes (Additional file 1: 
Table S1).  To avoid pseudo-replication, only the first
autumn and spring migration tracks were selected from
each individual.

Identifying stopover sites
We applied the method of Wang et al. (2018b) to segment
movement tracks into periods of “flight” and “non-flight”.
A cluster of positions within a radius of 35 km and within
a period of 48 h was defined as a stopover site (48 h
defined as the minimal time required to rest and start
accumulating energy stores from feeding; Drent et al. 
2006; Kölzsch et al. 2016). If subsequent tracking posi-
tions from an individual fell outside of this radius, but the
same individual returned to the same stopover site again
subsequently, then those points were still determined to
be in the same stopover cluster (van Wijk et al. 2012).
Land‑use and conservation status of stopovers
To characterize the landcover and assess the effective-
ness of the current extent of designated protected areas
for the protection of stopover sites used by tracked geese, 
we only retained the GPS locations where the velocity
between adjacent points was less than 1 km/h to exclude
the fast-moving positional fixes during stopovers (Zhang
et al. 2020). In order to compare between the land-use
and conservation status of stopovers in different migra-
tion routes, we divided these stopover sites into different
geographical regions based on mountain ranges, river
basins and country boundaries, such as the Daxing’an
Mountains (a.k.a Greater Khingan Mountain) and Yellow
River (Fig. 1, Table 2).
To characterize the landcover at stopover sites, we used
the Land Cover Atlas of the People’s Republic of China
(resolution 30 m × 30 m; Wu et al. 2017) for GPS loca-
tions within China, and the “FROM-GLC 2017v1” land
cover dataset (resolution 10 m × 10 m) created by the
Department of Earth System Science, Tsinghua Univer-
sity (Gong et al. 2019) for GPS locations outside of China. 
We divided landcover types into several broad catego-
ries, namely wetland, grassland, cropland, bare substrate
(including bare soil, desert and salina) and others (includ-
ing forest and artificial surface) (Gong et al. 2013). We
assigned each GPS location within the stopover sites to
a specific land-use type defined by the land cover data
using R 3.6.0 (R Core Team 2019).
To assess the conservation status at stopover sites, we
downloaded the boundary information from the National
Nature Reserves of China ([URL: "http://www.resdc.cn/data.aspx?DATAID=272"] http://​www.​resdc.​cn/​data.​
 aspx?​DATAID=​272), Database of Mongolian Protected
Areas (Ministry of Nature, Environment and Tour-
ism, Mongolia) and World Database of Protected Areas
(WDPA 2018; accessed at protectedplanet.net) for North
Korea. We then overlaid stopover sites within QGIS 3.18
to identify which GPS fixes were located within protected
area boundaries in different countries. 
Defining migration parameters
We defined the departure date as the time and date of
the position when the individual departed from sum-
mering/wintering sites and was judged by the meth-
ods above to have an acquired “flight” status. Arrival
date was defined as the first time when the individual
was judged to have arrived at wintering/summering
sites, based on the methods above to qualify as “non-
flight” status after a period of “flight”. Migration dura-
tion was calculated as the time the individual took to
migrate (including stopovers) between the last sum-
mering and first wintering position (autumn migration) 
or between the last wintering and the first summering
position (spring migration). A site where an individual
bird spent more than two days resting and feeding dur-
ing migration was defined as stopover site (Kölzsch
et al. 2016) and the number of stopovers was calcu-
lated accordingly. The stopover duration was derived
as the sum of all days spent at all stopover sites. Thus, 
the days actually spent traveling (total travel days) was
calculated as total migration duration minus stopover
duration. We defined flight leg as the journey connect-
ing subsequent stopover, wintering or summering sites, 
to generate the number of flight legs involved in each
autumn/spring episode. We defined migration distance
as the cumulative travel distance between summering
and wintering sites. Step length was calculated as the
migration distance divided by the number of flight legs
during each migration season. We calculated the path
tortuosity of the movement between summering and
wintering areas in both directions using the straight-
ness index (Benhamou 2004).  Based on the above
results, we were able to calculate migration speed as
migration distance divided by migration duration, and
the travel speed was calculated by dividing migration
distance by total travel days (Wang et al. 2018a; Deng
et al. 2019).
Comparison of migration parameters
For the spring and autumn migration parameters, we
used paired student t-tests to test for significant dif-
ferences between seasons among birds tagged at each
of the three different breeding areas. We used ANOVA
tests and Tukey–Kramer tests for statistical differences
between the three groups of geese from the different
breeding areas. All the analyses were conducted within R. 
All data presented in the tables and text in the form of
estimated means ± SD unless otherwise stated.

Results
After rejection of repeats (to avoid pseudo-replication),
we obtained a total of 104 Swan Geese which finished
both complete autumn and spring migration episodes
during 2017–2019, including 81 birds captured at Dau-
ria Region, 13 birds at Central Mongolia and 10 birds
Western Mongolia. Although all of these geese wintered
in the Yangtze floodplain, they selected different migra-
tion routes during autumn and spring migration to travel
there (Fig. 1).
Geese from Dauria Region
Geese summering in Dauria Region started autumn
migration between 28 August and 29 September
(median date = 12 September, N = 81).  Two birds
started in late August, and the other 79 geese started
in September. Geese arrived on the Yangtze River
wintering sites between 17 October and 8 December
(median = 18 November).  Of these, 13 birds arrived
at their wintering grounds in late October, 50 birds
arrived in November, and 18 birds arrived in early
December. Geese took on an average of 64.1 ± 15.4 days
to complete their 2677.9 ± 159.7 km southbound
migration. Autumn stopover sites used by geese were
concentrated between Dauria Region (summering site) 
and Yalu River Estuary, but any stopovers were rarely
used between the Yalu River and Yangtze River (see
Fig. 1).
Geese started their spring migration from the win-
tering grounds between 4 and 26 March (median = 21
March) and selected the Yalu River Estuary as their
first goal for staging stopovers. The first birds arrived
at the summering grounds on 9 April and the last one
arrived on 1 May (median = 16 April).  Most of the
birds arrived at the breeding grounds in April but a sin-
gle bird arrived at the beginning of May. Geese spent
29.7 ± 6.2 days to complete 2710.4 ± 221 km north-
bound migration. The few spring stopover sites were
located between the Yangtze River and Yalu River Estu-
ary, and most of them concentrated between the Yalu
River Estuary and the Huihe Wetland (see Fig. 1).
Although the routes and distance taken by the Dauria
Region Swan Geese were similar, there were significant
differences in migration patterns between two migra-
tion seasons (Table 1 and Figs. 2 and 3). The migration
duration of spring migration was 34 days, significantly
shorter than autumn migration (df = 80, t = 19.0, 
P < 0.001).  Swan Geese flew during spring migration
twice as fast as in autumn (95.1 km/day for spring
migration and 44.9 km/day for autumn migration, 
df = 80, t =  − 19.1, P < 0.001).  The travelling duration
in spring was 0.62 days longer than autumn migra-
tion (df = 80, t =  − 2.93, P < 0.01). The travel speed in 
spring (averaged 735 km/day) was significantly slower
than autumn (averaged 857.6 km/day; df = 80, t = 3.31, 
P < 0.001).  The stopover duration in spring migration
was 34 days, significantly shorter than that during
autumn migration (df = 80, t =  − 19.83, P < 0.001), while
the number of stopover sites did not differ significantly
between the seasons (df = 80, t =  − 1.6, P = 0.117). The
step length did not differ significantly between the two
seasons (df = 80, t =  − 1.9, P = 0.06).
Geese from Central Mongolia
Geese summering in Central Mongolia started autumn
migration between 3 and 28 September (median = 13
September, N = 13) and arrived at the wintering ground
between 24 October and 23 November (median date = 31
October). Six birds arrived at their wintering grounds in
the end of October and seven birds arrived in Novem-
ber. Geese took an average of 53.7 ± 9 days to complete
the 2603.8 ± 166.3 km southbound migration. During
autumn migration, all of the tagged birds used just one
area located near Daihai Lake as stopover site (see Fig. 1).
Geese started spring migration from the wintering
grounds between 9 and 21 March (median = 21 March).
The first birds arrived at the breeding grounds on 24
March and the last one arrived on 20 April (median = 5
April). Four birds arrived at the breeding grounds and
in March and the other nine arrived in April. Geese
spent 20.8 ± 8.1 days to complete the 2927.8 ± 388.8 km
northbound migration. During migration, most of geese
selected Daihai Lake and Ordos Basin as their stopover
sites. In addition, one bird chose the same spring migra-
tion route as that used by geese from Dauria Region ini-
tially and flew back from Eastern Mongolia (see Fig. 1).
Although the autumn and spring migration routes and
distance taken by Central Mongolia Swan Geese were
similar, there were significant differences in migration
patterns (Table 1, Figs. 2 and 3). The migration duration
of spring migration was 32 days significantly shorter than
in autumn (df = 12, t = 8.5, P < 0.001). The travel speed in
spring (averaged 685.8 km/day) is slower than autumn
(averaged 891.4 km/day; df = 80, t = 3.31, P < 0.001). Swan
Geese daily flew 3 times faster during spring than autumn
migration, which averaged 159.8 km/day in spring and
50 km/day in autumn and stopover duration in spring
migration was 34 days, shorter than that in autumn
migration (df = 12, t = 9.2, P < 0.001). Numbers of stopo-
ver sites averaged 1.6 during spring migration compared
to 1.9 during autumn, which did not differ significantly.
Geese from Western Mongolia
Geese summering in Western Mongolia started
autumn migration between 15 August and 4 October

(median = 10 September, N = 10).  One bird started
migration in the middle of August, seven in the Septem-
ber and two in the beginning of October. Geese arrived
at the wintering grounds between 11 October and 19
November (median = 24 October). Eight birds arrived in
the end of October and the other two arrived in Novem-
ber. During southbound migration, geese spent an aver-
age of 45.2 ± 18.6 days completing 3136.1 ± 242.4 km
migration. All birds used stopover sites in the Ordos
Basin.
Geese started spring migration from the wintering
grounds between 6 and 21 March (median = 8 March), 
and arrived at their summering grounds between 11 and
25 April (median = 20 April). Geese spent 25.6 ± 5.3 days
completing 3341.1 ± 284.9 km northbound migration. 
Most of geese selected the Ordos Basin, as the first stopo-
ver for a prolonged rest, followed by shorter periods at
their second stopover in Mongolia.
Although migration routes and distances taken by
Western Mongolia Swan Geese were similar, there
were again significant differences in migration pat-
terns (Table 1 and Figs. 2 and 3). The duration of spring
migration was 25.6 days, significantly shorter than in
autumn (df = 9, t = 3.2, P < 0.05). The mean migration

speed of spring migration was 136 km/day compared
to 85.8 km/day in autumn, which means Swan Geese
flew faster during spring migration than autumn
migration (df = 9, t =  − 2.9, P < 0.05). The travel dura-
tion in spring was 2 days longer than autumn migra-
tion (df = 9, t =  − 3.3, P < 0.05).  The travel speed on 
spring migration was significant slower than that of
autumn migration (averaged 572.8 km/day in spring
and 801.1 km/day in autumn; df = 9, t = 3.1, P < 0.05).
The stopover duration in spring migration was 25 days
less than that during autumn migration (df = 9, t = 3.6,

Comparison of the three migration routes
During autumn migration, the migration distance taken
by geese from Western Mongolia was longer than those 
migrating from Dauria Region and Central Mongo-
lia (adj.P < 0.001; ANOVA: F2,101
 = 35.58, P < 0.001).
Although geese from all three summering areas started
migration on similar dates (F2,101
 = 0.83, P = 0.438),
geese from Dauria Region arrived significantly later at
the Yangtze River than geese from Western and Central
Page 9
Damba   et al. Avian Research (2021) 12:73  Page 9 of 14
Mongolia (adj.P < 0.001; F2,101
 = 39.06, P < 0.001).  This
was the result of longer migration duration (adj.P < 0.001; 
adj.P = 0.06; F2,101
 = 8.70, P < 0.001) and stopover dura-
tion (adj.P < 0.001; adj.P = 0.05; F2,101
 = 9.48, P < 0.001).
The migration speed of geese from Western Mongolia
was faster than those from Central Mongolia and Dauria
Region (adj.P < 0.001; F2,101
 = 18.89, P < 0.001).
ANOVA tests showed the same significant differ-
ences in spring as in autumn for departure date, arrival
date, migration distance, migration duration and stopo-
ver duration. The migration speed of geese from Dauria
Region was slower than among those from Western and
Central Mongolia (adj.P < 0.001; F2,101
 = 35.98, P < 0.001).
The geese from Dauria Region used more stopover
sites than geese from Western and Central Mongolia
(adj.P = 0.01; adj.P < 0.001; F2,101
 = 11.47, P < 0.001), which
resulted in significantly shorter step lengths (adj.P < 0.001; 
F2,101
 = 32.08, P < 0.001).
The major stopover regions
Tracking identified eight major stopover regions used by
the Swan Geese during autumn and spring migration (see
Fig. 1 for locations). Among these, the Yalu River Estu-
ary was the most important for geese from Dauria Region
during both autumn and spring migration. Daihai Lake
was important for geese from Central Mongolia during
autumn migration, while the Ordos Basin was important
for geese from Central Mongolia during spring migration
and geese from Western Mongolia during both autumn
and spring migration periods (Table 2).
(1)Huihe Wetland, Inner Mongolia, China: 14 geese
used this site for an average of 13.7 days in autumn. 
These small, sandy lakes are located near a known
bird catching area, around 150 km away. The land-
use of stopover sites located here included 64% wet-
land, 22% cropland and 12% grassland in autumn
(Fig. 4). The percentage of positions used by staging
birds was only 3.5% (Table 2).
(2)Tashgai Tavan Lake, Dornod Province, Mongolia: 
Six geese used this lake as a stopover site during
autumn migration for an average of 15.9 days. The
land-use of stopover sites located here included
67% wetland, 22% grassland and 10% bare substrate
in autumn. This region is not protected.
(3) Wulagai Reservoir, Inner Mongolia, China: 20 geese
stayed for an average of 12.8 days in autumn, 11
geese (6.5 days) in spring. The land-use of stopover
sites located here included 67% wetland, 12% bare
substrate and 10% grassland in autumn, 69% wet-
land and 28% grassland in spring. This region is not
protected. 
(4)Xilamulun River, Inner Mongolia and Liaon-
ing Province, China: 25 geese stayed for a mean
of 16.8 days (autumn) and 71 geese for 13.1 days
(spring) at many small lakes in a sandy landscape, 
where they fed on nearby rice fields and roosted
on lakes. The land-use of stopover sites located
here included 68% wetland and 24% grassland in
autumn, 56% wetland and 35% cropland in spring. 
The percentage of the areas used by geese that is
protected was only 4.3% in autumn and 1.2% in
spring.
(5)Yalu River Estuary China/North Korean border: 
geese staged here for 9–80 days (mean = 48.8, 
N = 78) in autumn and 2–29 days (mean = 14.7, 
N = 65) in spring, feeding and roosting in the inter-
tidal estuary and mud flats. The land-use of stopo-
ver sites located here included 94% wetland in
autumn, 83% wetland and 14% cropland in spring. 
This area used by the geese during these periods is
almost totally un-protected.
(6)Daihai Lake, Inner Mongolia and Shanxi Prov-
ince, China: Central Mongolian Swan Geese
mainly rested here, on average remaining 50.1 days
in autumn. Only four geese (average duration
16.2 days) rested here in spring. All geese in this
area fed and roosted near lakes. The land-use of
stopover sites located here included 78% wetland
and 12% grassland in autumn, 68% wetland, 20% 
grassland and 11% cropland in spring. This region is
not protected.
(7) Orog Nuur Lake, Bayanhongor Province, Mongolia: 
Western Mongolian Swan Geese mainly rested here
as the first stopover sites during autumn migration
(average duration10.9 days). The land-use of stopo-
ver sites located here included 55% wetland, 29% 
bare substrate and 15% grassland in autumn. This
region is not protected.
(8)Ordos Basin, Inner Mongolia, China: In autumn, 
Western Mongolian Swan Geese mostly stayed in
the middle of basin (average stay 33.0 days), used
34% grassland, 30% bare substrate, 15% cropland
and 14% others. In spring, both Central and West-
ern Mongolian Swan Geese stayed at stopover sites
close to the Yellow River (average 11.0 and 16.2 days
respectively), used 70% cropland and 10% grassland. 
Only 3.9% (autumn) and none of the areas used in
spring by staging birds are currently protected.
Discussion
We used data from 104 Swan Geese tracked using GPS/
GSM telemetry to identify the spring and autumn migra-
tion parameters, migration route and stopover sites

Fig. 4  Percentage habitat use of Swan Geese during stopovers in the major stopover regions during autumn (top) and spring (bottom) migration
respectively. Sample sizes are indicated by N (number of tracked geese) and n (total number of GPS fixes per category)
from birds using three different breeding areas. For the
first time, these data were able to show that, despite fol-
lowing three discrete migration routes, Swan Geese all 
came to winter together in one place, the Yangtze River
floodplain. Despite the fact that the birds tagged in West-
ern Mongolia undertook significantly longer migration

routes, those birds recorded faster travel speeds, with the
result that they and the birds tagged in Central Mongo-
lia arrived earliest to wintering areas, significantly ear-
lier than birds tagged at Dauria Region, which generally
had the shortest migration distances. This was because
Dauria Region birds spent significantly longer at their
stopover sites than birds from either of the other two
breeding areas. Dauria Region and Central Mongolian
birds generally departed their summering areas and sub-
sequent stopover sites in autumn when local tempera-
tures approached or fell below freezing (unpubl. data),
supporting the frost hypothesis of Xu and Si (2019). On
the return migration, Dauria Region birds arrived signifi-
cantly later to the breeding areas than either Central or
Western Mongolian birds, again the result of spending
longer periods on the stopover sites en route. Arrival of
tagged Swan Geese from the Dauria Region and Central
Mongolian breeding areas to their stopover sites coin-
cided with minimum temperatures exceeding freezing
point (unpubl. data), suggesting the extent of frost was
determining their movement northwards in spring as
well. This may suggest that the rate of movement along
their flyways was determined by the annual rate of spring
thaw and that this could contribute to the observed dif-
ferences between the three groups following different
spring migration routes, but more tracking data from
multiple seasons are needed to confirm this.
Despite the sympatric nature of their wintering
grounds, tagged Swan Geese showed almost discrete
migration corridors back to their respective breeding
areas, as had been the case during autumn migration
(Fig. 1). As a result, birds from the different breeding
provenances used largely mutually exclusive staging
stopover sites along their respective migration corridors. 
In autumn, Swan Geese tagged at Dauria Region mostly
used the Yalu River Estuary, Central Mongolian birds
used Daihai Lake heavily in autumn (but also by some
individuals in spring) and Western Mongolian Swan
Geese used the Ordos Basin staging areas (in autumn
and spring). Interestingly, nine Central Mongolian tagged
birds also used the Ordos Basin as a spring staging stopo-
ver site. Away from Ordos Basin, > 55% of positions used
by autumn staging Swan Geese (and > 56% spring) were
in wetlands. The remainder were mainly on grassland
and cropland dependent upon agriculture. While this
implies that the extent, availability and quality of these
natural habitats are adequate to support these birds with
overspill to agricultural land, the future safeguard of
these wetlands requires protection as local and national
nature reserves. In the Ordos Basin, autumn geese used
a variety of different habitats which perhaps suggests
problems finding adequate food during that season, but
were heavily reliant on cropland in spring, suggesting in 
comparison with the other staging areas, this area has
insufficient wetland resources available to these birds
during the critical spring migration and prelude to breed-
ing. Furthermore, a superficial comparison between
tracking positions and protected area site boundaries
suggests that birds from all three summering areas use
autumn and spring staging areas that enjoy almost no
nature conservation protection at national level at all. 
There is a particular urgent need for autumn stopover
sites associated with Daihai Lake and the Ordos Basin to
be better protected under local and national nature con-
servation criteria. We remain lamentably ignorant about
the numbers of birds using these areas, food resources
and the nature of the safe roosting habitats used by
these birds during their stay there. We would therefore
urge local studies to determine the most heavily used
areas (and therefore most important areas for the geese) 
as a basis for implementing site safeguard through desig-
nation of protected areas. Foraging and ecological stud-
ies would also help to improve local habitat management
(for instance to provide protection from disturbance and
maybe sacrificial crops in areas where geese are heavily
dependent upon cropland and farmland) to provide opti-
mal conditions for the birds during the relatively short
time they are present in this area. Finally, we would advo-
cate subsequent feedback monitoring to assess the effects
of protected area designation and habitat management in
relation to subpopulation annual growth rate to protect
these areas and the geese using them more effectively in
the future.
For the tagged Swan Geese from Dauria Region, Yalu
River Estuary was the most important stopover site. 
The Yalu Estuary is long recognised as a very important
spring and autumn staging area for Swan Geese breed-
ing in northeastern Mongolia (Batbayar et al. 2011; Choi
et al. 2016), but it is clearly also vital for Inner Mongolian
breeding birds from China. Sixty-five of the tagged indi-
viduals among the 81 tracked geese (80%) used it as stop-
over in spring, and 78 individuals (96%) in autumn. Those
geese using the site showed the longest average stopover
durations there on the Yalu River (49 days in autumn and
15 days in spring, significantly longer than on the Xila-
mulun River and the Inner Mongolia grassland further
north).  Indeed, Swan Geese left the Xilamulun River
southwards when the daily minimum temperature in
autumn was still high (3.7 °C, unpublished data), suggest-
ing more attractive conditions on the Yalu River, which
being on the coast with a very extensive intertidal zone
enjoys a milder climate, freezing later and thawing ear-
lier than more continental areas at the same latitude. 
The Yalu Estuary is situated within highly militarised
areas, which may give the birds and their habitats some
de facto protection, but this is by no means guaranteed.

We therefore also urge more cross border collaboration
to encourage joint research programmes, scientific moni-
toring and international conservation actions to protect
these birds during their two important and major staging
periods at this vital site.
Our results again confirm among birds tracked from
all three migratory corridors, that unlike many Arctic
breeding goose species in the same region (e.g. Deng
et al. 2019),  Swan Geese undertake spring migration
faster than in autumn. For all territory holding migratory
breeding birds, theory suggests that the earliest arriv-
ing birds in the best condition have the greatest chance
of securing best territories, breeding earliest and enjoy-
ing the longest breeding season (Milonoff et al. 1998; 
Kokko 1999; Moore et al. 2005).  Earlier hatched and
fledged young also have greater chance of surviving to
breed (Perrins 1970), so there is an imperative for breed-
ing birds to return earliest to their breeding areas, which
means spring migration is often of shorter duration than
autumn. This has been confirmed among other species, 
e.g. waders (Alves et al. 2016), gulls (Bustnes et al. 2013),
swifts (Henningsson et al. 2009) and songbirds (DeLuca
et al. 2015) as well as in Bar-headed Geese (Anser indi-
cus) (Hawkes et al. 2013).
The main difference in timing between Swan Goose
migrations in the two seasons concerned stopover dura-
tion. Migration distance did not differ significantly
between spring and autumn for the Swan Goose, but
geese took half the time in spring to cover the same dis-
tance. In spring, they undertook relatively few migration
flight legs, when individual step length was longer than
in autumn. Swan Geese stayed much longer at autumn
stopover sites than in spring, since overall travel speed
was similar.
Conclusions
Use of modern telemetry devices enabled us to identify
significant differences in migration duration, speed and
stopover duration of Swan Geese tagged in three differ-
ent parts of the breeding range, which used almost dis-
crete migration routes to sympatric wintering areas in the
Yangtze River floodplain. These novel findings suggest
the possibility for some degree of population structuring, 
if individuals using these different migration routes are
isolated, as long as genetic continuity is not maintained
by pairing on the wintering grounds (as seems likely).
Southbound autumn migration duration and stopover
duration of birds tagged at Dauria Region exceeded those
marked in Central and Western Mongolia. The autumn
migration speed of Western Mongolian Swan Geese
was faster than other two routes. However, as all Swan
Geese seemed to respond to frost by travelling south-
wards from breeding and staging areas in the same way, 
it seems more likely that the timing of migration along
the different migration routes was response to environ-
mental conditions rather than having any basis in genet-
ics or cultural tradition. During spring migration, Central
and Western Mongolian birds arrived earlier than Dauria
Region birds to the breeding grounds, again seemingly
following the vernal thaw.
The most important spring and autumn stopover
site for Dauria Region tagged Swan Geese was the Yalu
River Estuary during spring and autumn migration. 
Results showed that tagged birds from Central Mon-
golian were heavily reliant on Daihai Lake and Western
Mongolian birds on the Ordos Basin, drawing attention
to the need to adequately protect these stopover sites
and ensure the sympathetic management of habitats
for the geese during their short, but highly significant
stopovers at these sites.

Availability of data and materials
The raw data for this article can be presented for review, but cannot be
published because waterbirds in the East Asian-Australasian Flyway are highly
threatened by illegal hunting and open access of the tracking data will show
the critical location and timing of stopovers, which could potentially impact
upon the birds greatly in this instance.
