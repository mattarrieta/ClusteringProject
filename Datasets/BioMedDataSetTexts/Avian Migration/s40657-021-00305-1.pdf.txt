Citrine Wagtail migration
on the Indo‑European flyway: a first geolocator

and endurance flights to cross ecological
barriers

Abstract 
Most long-distance migrating passerines that breed in Europe spend their winters in Africa, with only a few species
migrating eastward to spend the non-breeding period in South Asia. The use of the Indo-European flyway is rare and
has been poorly studied so far. However, it is extremely interesting as within that system we are currently witnessing a
recent range expansion of European breeding long distance migrants and thus the lengthening of migration routes. 
It may therefore conceal a unique migratory strategies and behaviour that can help us to understand the underlying
factors and mechanisms determining the evolution of migration routes, strategies and breeding range extinction. 
Based on light-level geolocator we reveal a first track of the Citrine Wagtail (Motacilla citreola) migration, providing
insight into the migration pattern, timing and behaviour of the species that recently has extended its migration
routes. Unexpectedly, the studied individual did not retrace a recent range expansion that runs north and east from
the Caspian Sea but followed a migration route running south form the Caspian sea, suggesting possible presence
of an alternative species range expansion. The overall migration distance between the breeding site in Poland and
the non-breeding site in Pakistan was about 10,420 km and included two endurance movement phases (920 and
2240 km) covering 30% of the whole journey length, with an average movement speed of 574 km/day. We explain
this migration behaviour as an adaptation for crossing the ecological barriers imposed by arid environments.

(Lislevand and Hahn 2015; Stach et al. 2016; Brlík et al. 
2018; Lisovski et al. 2021). Also the recoveries of ringed
birds remained scarce and deficient for describing the
Indo-European flyway (Lisovski et al. 2021). This flyway
is however unique as it is utilized by many bird spe-
cies that are currently extending their breeding ranges
towards western Europe (del Hoyo et al. 2005). Migra-
tion routes often reflect historical expansions of bird
populations (Wiltschko and Wiltschko 2003; Bairlein

et al. 2012). This was found recently in passerines that
winter in India sub-continent (Stach et al. 2016; Brlík
et al. 2018). Studying migration of the species that utilize
Indo-European flyway can therefore provide information
about the course of the breeding population expansion, 
mechanisms underlying the migration routes evolution
and knowledge about key stopover and wintering areas
within that system.
The Citrine Wagtail (Motacilla citreola) is a passerine
that gradually expanded its breeding range from Asia
westward to areas in central and western Europe (Meiss-
ner and Skakuj 1997) and is an example of a species that
had has recently lengthened its migration route (Newton
2008). In last 60 years, the breeding range of the subspe-
cies werae has extended westward more than 1000 km, 
from the Moscow region to all central European coun-
tries (Dementiev and Gladkov 1954; Keller et al. 2020),
where it currently breeds regularly (Ściborska 2004; Kra-
jewski 2016). The Citrine Wagtail population from north
Siberia winters from south of the Caspian Sea and south-
ern Iran to India (Cramp 1998), while birds from central
European Russia migrate eastward from the Caspian Sea
through Turkmenistan, eastern Iran and Afghanistan to
spend winter on the Indian sub-continent (Ali and Rip-
ley 1973). However, information regarding Citrine Wag-
tail migration routes between breeding sites in central
Europe and wintering sites is almost completely lack-
ing (see: Hnatyna et al. 2020). The aim of this study was
to use light-level loggers to reveal the Citrine Wagtail
migratory pattern and to identify stopovers and winter-
ing quarters.
The fieldwork was carried out in north Poland (52.98° 
N, 23.70° E) where within a habitat of around 50 ha
(rewetted degraded peatland) 4 to 8 pairs of Citrine Wag-
tails breed regularly (Tumiel et al. 2013). In June 2016, 
we trapped 9 individuals (6 males and 3 females) that we
ringed and equipped with light-level geolocators (0.6 g
Intigeo-P50Z11-7, Migrate Technology, Cambridge, UK) 
by attachment to the bird’s rump with a flexible 0.8 mm
thick leg-loop harness (Rappole and Tipton 1991).  In
2017, we recovered one geolocator from a previously
tagged male and one more male with a tag was seen in
the field with a plastic ring (not retaped), indicating that
at least two different tagged individuals had returned
(22% of tagged birds).
To analyse the light-level data we used a threshold
approach in R package ‘GeoLight’ (Lisovski and Hahn
2012; R Core Team 2018). To determine sun elevation
angle (at a light threshold value = 2) we used ‘getEle-
vation’ function (based one light recordings from the
breading site after tag deployment) and Hill–Ekstrom
calibration (Lisovski and Hahn 2012; Lisovski et al. 
2020) of the longest stationary site (wintering site). 
This resulted in obtaining − 3.2° and − 4° sun elevation
angle, respectively. We decide to apply a mean value of
those (SEA = − 3.6) to calculate the coordinates for the
non-breeding period. Stationary periods were classi-
fied using the ‘changeLight’ function (change probability
q = 0.8) and a minimum stationary period of 3 days (Lis-
ovski et al. 2020). In order to avoid stationary periods
separation caused by single large errors in the twilight, 
we used ‘mergeSites’ function to finally estimate stopo-
ver (distance threshold = 150 km) and wintering sites
(distance threshold = 300 km).  However, due to a lack
of long stationary periods on the spring migration (only
one was longer than 3 days), in two instances we also
calculated two potential stopovers shorter than 3 days
assigning them as potential stopovers (Fig. 1). The pres-
ence of those stopovers were found by visual inspection
of latitude and longitude change over time as well as a
‘changeLight’ function with minimum stationary period
of 1 day. The arrival and departure timing and move-
ment periods were determined by inspecting patterns of
latitude and longitude over time (Lindström et al. 2016).
Long movement phases were classified as part of a migra-
tion between stationary sites longer than 24 h with con-
tinuous longitudinal changes over time and no stopovers
identified. Maps were created in GIS (ArcGIS 10.1, Red-
lands, CA, USA) based on stationary periods and errors
(interquartile ranges) estimated in ‘mergeSites’ function.
We calculated a great circle distances between succes-
sive stationary sites (see Additional file 1: Table S1) and
the migration distance as the sum of those distances
between the breeding and wintering grounds (Table 1).
The migration duration was calculated as the total num-
ber of days spent on migration (between departure and
arrival dates),  whereas the duration of movement was
considered as the number of days spent moving, exclud-
ing stopover periods. Movement speed (km/day) was
calculated as the distance between stopover positions
divided by the number of movement days, whereas
migration speed (km/day) was determined as the migra-
tion distance divided by the total number of days spent
on migration, including stopover periods.
The studied individual left the breeding site on 13 July
and in one and a half days moved south to west Ukraine
where it spent 30 days. Given that this first stop (post
breeding site, Fig. 1) was fairly long and the estimated
positions of that site were based on a high variation in
latitude in that period (because of irregular pattern in
light measurements),  we interpret this stopover as a
dispersal towards post-breeding moulting and fuelling
sites. Our conclusion is based on Hnatyna et al. (2020) 
who found that in western Ukraine half of the captured
Catrine Wagtail adults at that time of the year were
in various stages of active moult and fat deposition.

Distances are reportd to nearest 10 km. Dates in the end of spring migration is partly missing due to improper light measurements (see methods) thus the 1 arrival
date is the date 2 days after the last stopover site position while the 2 is the first light logger position at the breeding sites when the logger starts working again. 
Arrival dates indicate the presumed period when the individual arrived to breeding grounds
The authors estimate that the moult lasts around one
month and thus starts after mid-July which fits into
timing of the post-breeding site we distinguished (15
July–14 August).  Moreover during the moult period
birds often make night roosts in reed beds (Hnatyna
et al. 2020) what may explain a different pattern in 
light measurements and so high variation in posi-
tions estimates (Lisovski et al. 2012, 2020). We there-
fore reported migration parameter estimations based
on both departure dates from the breeding site and
from the post-breeding site (Table 1). After 14 August, 
the studied bird started a fast migration, proceeding

in a southeast direction and making 2 stopovers (in a
total of 16 days, including movement: 15–31 August) 
along the north coast of the Black Sea (Fig. 1). From
there, in 48 h, the bird performed the first long move-
ment covering a distance of 920 km (mean movement
speed = 460 km/day, Table 2),  reaching north Iran, 
where it made a prolonged stop of 16 days. On 18 Sep-
tember the studied Citrine Wagtail performed a second
fast (mean movement speed = 640 km/day, Table 2) 
and long movement phase (2240 km in 84 h, Table 2) 
crossing the arid landscapes in Iran and Pakistan until
arriving on 21 September, at the lower Indus River val-
ley in Pakistan. This endurance flight indicates that the
preceding stopover (that was the longest on migra-
tion) had a fuel deposition meaning to allow crossing
the arid landscape. The autumn migration distance was
4800 km (duration 70 days) with a migration speed of
69 km/day when considering the post-breeding site as
a first stopover. Excluding it, the migration distance
covered 4450 km (duration 38.5 days) with an average
migration speed of 116 km/day (Table 1). The studied
individual wintered in south Pakistan close to or within
the Indus river delta (duration 178.5 days). The spring
migration started on 19 March following a more south-
ern route back to the breeding site than it had taken in
the autumn migration (Fig. 1). The first 9 days of the
journey were in progressive movement phases west-
ward (1860 km) with a relatively slow movement speed
of 207 km/day (Additional file 1: Table S1), which sug-
gests that, at this part of the journey the Citrine Wag-
tail was foraging and flying in an intermittent migratory
strategy. After that, the studied male made the only
long stopover during the spring migration (5 days: 28
March–02 April),  potentially in the Tigris-Euphra-
tes delta (the latitude of this site is highly uncertain
because of closeness to Equinox [Lisovski et al. 2012]).
From that site, the Citrine Wagtail continued a fast
journey, heading in a northwest direction, with a short
stop in Turkey (a potential stopover 1.5 days, Fig. 1) 
afterwards heading north (potentially crossing the
Black Sea) where it made a short stop for at least one
day (6–7 April). However the latitudes of those position
may be uncertain while estimated based on four and
two positions respectively. Afterwards (08–21 April), 
the tag recorded the light improperly (permanent full
light range).  The estimated positions after the light
recording error (from 21 to 27 April) were around the
breeding sites (after that time, the tag was no longer
recording), indicating that the spring migration had fin-
ished within the period between 9 and 21 April (assum-
ing at least 48 h to get to the breeding sites from the
last spring stopover) and covered 5640 km (Table 1).
According to this assumption, the spring migration
duration was between 21.5 and 33 days, which gives a
migration speed between 171 and 262 km/day. How-
ever, while the average spring migration speed until
the last stopover before the tag record light improperly
was around 270 km/day (Additional file 1: Table S1),
the second value of the overall spring migration speed
seems to be more reasonable because it is very unlikely
that at the end of migration (650 km from the breed-
ing grounds) a male would change the migration behav-
iour and move relatively slowly with an average speed
of 57 km/day, especially given that the early arrival
of males to the breeding grounds is highly beneficial
(explained below). We therefore use spring migration
speed 262 km/day in further discussions.
The overall spring migration speed (262 km/day) of
the studied individual was approximately twice as fast
as the autumn migration speed (116 km/day) and was a
consequence of a longer stopover duration in the autumn
(26.5 days in autumn vs. 7.5 days in spring, in total). A
faster spring migration is also observed in many other
long-distance migrants, since early arrival at the breed-
ing grounds allows the establishment of higher quality
territories and increases the chances of finding a mate, 
thereby relating to a higher fitness (Moore et al. 2005; 
Nilsson et al. 2013). This pattern was also the case for the
other individuals studied so far on the Indo-European
flyway (Lislevand et al. 2015; Stach et al. 2016; Lisovski
et al. 2021).
Within the overall migration of the studied Citrine
Wagtail male, we distinguished two long movement
phases covering a distance of 920 and 2240 km in autumn
(30% of the whole journey length), with an average speed
574 km/day. We explain this rapid migration behaviour
by the need to cross ecological barriers with limited refu-
elling possibilities in the Caucasian Region and the arid

landscapes of the mountains and deserts in Iran (Kavir
and Dasht-e Lut Desert) and Pakistan (Kharan Desert).
The lack of clear long movement phases in the spring
migration were presumably related to better feeding con-
ditions in spring than in the autumn, since the precipita-
tion in that region is lower in autumn and thus potential
food resources for insectivorous bird species are very
limited (Dolnik 1990; Lisovski et al. 2021).
The longest movement phase (84 h, Table 2) took place
during the autumn migration when the Citrine Wagtail
crossed the arid landscapes of Iran and Pakistan at a dis-
tance of 2240 km (640 km/day). This journey covered
3 days and 5 nights. Assuming that the ground flight
speed of the Citrine Wagtail is similar to Pied Wagtail
(Motacilla alba) (13.3 m/s, Pennycuick et al. 2013), the
studied individual had to fly for about 47 h (56% of this
movement phase) at maximum speed to cover that dis-
tance (no wind constraint/support consideration). In that
long movement phase, the maximum day light was 37 h
and 53 min (time with any light intensity recorded by
the tag at this part of the journey). This suggests that the
studied individual most likely also migrated at night to
cover that distance. It is surprising while in general wag-
tails are considered to be a diurnal migrants (Alerstam
and Ulfstrand 1975; Biebach et al. 2000; Schmaljohann
et al. 2007a), and this also confirms behavioural observa-
tions of the Citrine Wagtail: they migrate in the daytime
with yellow wagtails flock and use collective night roost-
ing sites in reed beds (Zavyalov et al. 2008; Hnatyna et al. 
2020). A prolonged nocturnal migration of an assumed
diurnal migrant was also recently found for the Tawny
Pipit (Anthus campestris),  as more than 2/3 of all its
migratory movements were carried out at night (Briedis
et al. 2020b). Given that nocturnal migration is beneficial
for birds due to a reduction in dehydration risks caused
by high temperatures when crossing the deserts (Biebach
1990), and that flying non-stop in the daytime excludes
the possibility of recovering energy and water reserves at
small oases along the way (Schwilch et al. 2002), a noc-
turnal migration of assumed diurnal migrants may be a
more common phenomenon than is currently recog-
nised (Briedis et al. 2020b). We suggest that the mixed
day-night migratory strategy (Schmaljohann et al. 2007b; 
Newton 2008) could represent a flexible migration strat-
egy where prolonged flights were brought about by the
need to cross ecological barriers ( Schmaljohann et al. 
2007b; Adamík et al. 2016)—in our example, a desert in
Iran and Pakistan.
During the autumn and spring migration, the studied
Citrine Wagtail flew south from the Caspian Sea. This
migration course was unexpected while the migration
routes of a Citrine Wagtail described previously (Cramp
1998) runs through a well-known passerine passage in the 
Central Asian region east of the Caspian Sea ( Dolnik 1990; 
Chernetsov et al. 2007a). This migration route also retraced
Citrine Wagtail breeding range expansion (Meissner and
Skakuj 1997; Ściborska 2004) observed in the last decades
(see the breeding range changes on Fig. 1). A new migra-
tion route found here may therefore reflect an alternative
expansion direction of Citrine Wagtail to Europe. If so, this
suggests that breeding Citrine Wagtails found in central
and western Europe may originate from a different histori-
cal subpopulation.
The possible presence of alternative migrating routes that
suggests different population expansion directions and a
mixed day-night migratory strategy makes the migration of
the Citrine Wagtail interesting to study in future, especially
with recent availability of multi-sensor tracking devices
(Bäckman et al. 2017; Liechti et al. 2018).
