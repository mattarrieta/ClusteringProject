Abstract 
Background:  The Eurasian Spoonbill (Platalea leucorodia) occurs throughout Eurasia and North and sub-Saharan
Africa, with three recognized subspecies and six geographically distributed populations. However, in China, we knew
almost nothing about migration routes, habitat use and effectiveness of current site protection measures for this
species.
Methods:  We deployed Global Positioning System/Global System for Mobile Communications (GPS/GSM) satellite
trackers on 29 Eurasian Spoonbills captured in summer in Mongolia and northeastern China, to obtain complete
migration routes data from 10 individuals from 19 complete migration episodes.
Results:  Tracking data showed no geographical overlap during the annual cycle in Eurasian Spoonbills marked in the
two main summering areas. Birds marked in the Naoli River Basin in Heilongjiang Province, China, wintered along the
Jiangsu coastline in China, while Eurasian Spoonbills from two discrete summering areas (in Inner and western Mon‑
golia) overwintered inland in the Yangtze River floodplain of China. Excluding the single Inner Mongolian bird, spring
migration was significantly faster than autumn migration in the other two groups of birds. Eurasian Spoonbills mainly
used water, wetland and grassland habitats in summer, but almost exclusively water in winter. Lack of protection of
staging sites used by all the birds in spring and poor levels of protection throughout the annual cycle for western
Mongolian birds (5–22%) gives considerable cause for concern, although sites used in other time by East Mongolian
and Naoli River birds in the rest of their annual life cycle enjoyed good levels of protection (49–95%).
Conclusions:  These results revealed previously unknown relationships between summering and wintering areas, 
migration routes and stopover sites for Eurasian Spoonbills wintering in China, suggesting the existence of discrete
biogeographical population units. They also identified winter habitat use of Eurasian Spoonbills in China, confirming
open water habitats as being critical throughout the annual cycle, although based on small sample size, gaps in cur‑
rent site safeguard networks for these populations.

which breeds mainly in Mauritanian and coastal islands
(Piersma et al. 2012);  (2) a Red Sea subspecies (P. l. 
archeri), which breeds in the Red Sea and along the coast
of Somalia. The remainder are considered to belong to
the nominate subspecies (3) the Eurasian Spoonbill (P. 
l. leucorodia) which is widely distributed throughout
Eurasia. Within this third group, there are four accepted
biogeographical populations (Wetlands International
2021): (1) a West Europe/West Mediterranean and West
Africa population, which breeds along western coastal
areas of Europe, winters in the western Mediterranean
and the western coastal areas of Africa and is estimated
to number 11,300 birds (Champagnon et al. 2019); (2) a
Southeast European/Mediterranean and tropical African
population, which winters in the Mediterranean or tropi-
cal northern Africa, estimated to number 11,700 birds
(Champagnon et al. 2019);  (3) a West/Southwest and
South Asian population, which breeds extensively across
Central and Southwest Asia, winters in Southwest and
South Asia, and numbers some 23,000 individuals (Wet-
lands International 2021); and finally (4) an East Asian
population, which breeds mainly in Northeast Asia, 
Mongolia and China, winters in Southeast China, South 
Korea and Japan, which is thought to number 20,000
birds (Xi et al. 2021) (Fig. 1). Because of its extensive
range, relative abundance and stable population trend, 
the Eurasian Spoonbill population is listed by Birdlife
International (BirdLife International 2019) as a species
of least concern (LC). However, we still know lamentably
little about its flyway structure and the potential for small
discrete elements of the species to be threatened because
of its narrow feeding niche and reliance upon threatened
and degrading wetlands.
There has been much research on the reproduction, 
feeding habits (Aguilera et al. 1996; Veen et al. 2012; 
Enners et al. 2020), migration (Jelena et al. 2012), home
range and habitat selection (El-Hacen et al. 2013; Bellisa-
rio 2018) of European and African birds. In contrast, very
few studies have taken place in East Asia, mainly con-
cerning breeding and wintering (Li 2016), feeding habits
and habitat use (Zhang 2018). So there is an urgent need
to understand the relationships between breeding, stag-
ing and wintering areas used by birds to identify discrete
biogeographical populations, establish effective monitor-
ing programmes to determine trajectories in abundance
and develop site safeguard and effective conservation

programmes for their protection. In this study, we report
the first deployment of satellite tracking technology to
study the migration of the Eurasian Spoonbill in East
Asia, to establish the migration routes and strategy of the
species, its habitat use and the degree of site safeguard
currently in place to protect areas used along its regular
migration corridors. Given the results of these studies, 
we provide recommendations to improve its conserva-
tion status in the future. 
tracking. Eight of the analyzed individuals were marked
as juveniles and as Eurasian Spoonbills only starts breed-
ing at age of 3 years, we accept that these birds in their
sub-adult summers would be less loyal to specific breed-
ing localities than the adult birds (Pigniczki and Vegvari
2015). The multi-year migration route data from these 10
individuals form the basis for the analysis in this study. 
Information on the individual birds and their loggers is
summarized in Additional file 1: Table S1.
Methods
Transmitter types and attachment
Between July 2016 and August 2018, 29 Eurasian Spoon-
bills were captured at 3 separate locations on the sum-
mering areas (25 juveniles, 2 adults, 2 of unknown age, 
no birds were sexed in the field).  Of these, 16 were
caught in 2016 at Naoli River Basin (46.73° N, 132.18° E; 
Qixinhe National Nature Reserve in Heilongjiang Prov-
ince, China), 2 in 2017 at Hulun Lake (48.93° N, 117.38° 
E; Inner Mongolia, China) and 11 in 2018 at Uvs Lake
(50.46° N, 93.10° E; Mongolia). We rounded up flightless
pre-fledging juvenile birds and drove them onto movable
funnel nets, deploying backpack trackers with solar cells
to maintain battery power on the bird’s backs using Tef-
lon ribbon. We caught adults at roosting areas at night
using spotlights. The 18 Eurasian Spoonbills captured in
2016 and 2017 were all fitted with backpack-mounted
loggers from Hunan Global Messenger Co. Ltd, China
(HQXS, weight 15–22 g).  The 11 Eurasian Spoonbills
captured in 2018 were fitted with backpack-mounted
loggers from Ornitela, Lithuania (weight 25 g).  The
tracking loggers collected location information via the
Global Positioning System (GPS) and sent the data back
to a server through a mobile communications network
(GSM). In this study, the HQXS loggers collected 12 to 24
GPS positions per day, and the Ornitela loggers collected
24 to 144 GPS positions per day, the actual number of
points depending on how much power remained in the
tracker batteries.
Because of technical problems, 14 transmitters
were lost (12 for HQXS and 2 for Ornitela, lost after
37–137 days on the breeding areas),  no data were
obtained from 4 transmitters (all Ornitela) and one bird
either died or lost its transmitter in the breeding areas
27 days after catching. Lost devices or deaths of birds
were determined based on total lack of movement reg-
istered by in-built accelerometers (Ornitela devices) 
or when a transmitter failed to move from its apparent
position over 7 consecutive days (HQXS). Of the origi-
nal 29 Eurasian Spoonbills, 10 individuals provided full
information from at least one complete spring or autumn
migration (Additional file 1: Table S1),  generating a
total of 19 complete migration routes obtained through 
Defining migration periods
We wrote simple routines in R (R development core team
2020) to delete GPS locations with null values or inad-
missible coordinates. We used Wang et al.’s (2018) first
passage time method to differentiate the migration peri-
ods when each bird could be categorized into “fly” and
“non-fly” behavior. Any “non-fly” state lasting for more
than 2 days (48 h; Koelzsch et al. 2016) within an activity
radius less than 50 km was defined as staging at a stopo-
ver site and the number of discrete stopover sites was
calculated accordingly. Throughout this paper, we define
autumn migration as starting with the first “fly” state
shown by an individual departing the summering site and
the first “non-fly” state of that individual arriving at the
wintering site. Spring migration was defined as extend-
ing from the first “fly” status of an individual leaving the
wintering site until the first “non-fly” status of that indi-
vidual after arrival at the summering site. The summer-
ing points was defined as the GPS location from the end
of the spring migration to the beginning of the autumn
migration.
Defining migration parameters
We here define nine migration parameters for each indi-
vidual migration episode as follows. The migration start
time was defined as the time when the tracked individ-
ual clearly left the summering/wintering ground based
on attaining its first “fly” status. That migration episode
ended when the same individual arrived at the winter-
ing/summering site when the first “non-fly” status was
recorded (Wang et al. 2018).  We defined duration of
migration as the difference between these two times, i.e. 
between the beginning and the end of a full migration
episode (including the time at stopover sites). The num-
ber of stopover sites was defined as the number of times
the tracked individual used separate stopover sites (as
defined above) and stopover duration was the cumula-
tive sum of all time spent at the stopover sites throughout
the migration episode. Migration distance refers to all the
cumulative “fly” distances taken by a tracked individual
during a migration episode, excluding the distance flown
during activities at stopover sites. The migration speed
is the overall average speed of the tracked individual in
Page 4
Xi et al. Avian Research (2021) 12:70  Page 4 of 17
the migration process, the value obtained by dividing
the migration distance by the migration duration. The
daily travel speed is calculated as the migration distance
divided by the “fly” time (the migration duration minus
the rest duration) (Nilsson et al. 2013). We calculated
the Straightness Index as the ratio of the difference in
distance between the straight-line distance between the
start and end points of migration and the actual route
taken by each bird (Benhamou 2004). Based on the data
size and the similarity of migration routes of the tracked
individuals, we used Wilcoxon rank-sum test to compare
the parameters of autumn migration between two groups
of birds, which were differentiated by their migration
routes. Values are given as mean ± standard deviation, 
unless otherwise stated.
In order to get a clearer understanding of the stopo-
ver sites of the Eurasian Spoonbill during the spring and
autumn migration, we also counted the number of sites
where the stopover duration was longer than 6 h (but
less than 48 h) and where the range of activity was within
30 km. These we named “stop sites” where spoonbills
could potentially drink, rest, preen and feed to a limited
extent, to be distinguished from “stopover sites” defined
above, where prolonged stopover duration imply great
nutritional and energetic benefit.
Quantifying habitat use
We used the tracking data from the ten Eurasian Spoon-
bills whilst they were at rest to determine the habitat
use of these individuals during summer and winter. We
extracted “non-fly” segments from the tracking data and
overlaid these positions on land cover data within ArcGIS
10.3. We used the 10-m resolution global land cover ras-
ter layer released by Tsinghua University in 2017 (used to
analyze the land cover types outside China) (Gong et al. 
2019) and the 30-m resolution national land cover ras-
ter layer within China in 2015 as base maps. We merged
second level land use types from 2015 data (based on
the FROM-GLC-Hierarchy) into first-level types to har-
monize with the 2017 data, resulting in ten land cover
types: including cropland (including rice fields), forest, 
grassland, shrubland, wetland, water, tundra, impervious
surface, bare land, snow/ice ([URL: "http://data.ess.tsinghua.edu.cn/"] http://​data.​ess.​tsing​hua.​edu.​
 cn/).
Establishing degree of protected area use
Finally, to determine the extent to which the tagged win-
tering Eurasian Spoonbills used the existing protected
area network, we overlaid the “non-fly” stationary posi-
tions from the tagged birds upon the world natural
reserve boundary data (UNEP WCMC 2017) and Chi-
na’s national nature reserve boundary data ([URL: "http://www.resdc.cn/"] http://​www.​
 resdc.​cn/) within the ArcGIS 10.3 environment. 
Results
Chinese wintering birds originate from at least three
breeding areas
Based on the tracking data, Eurasian Spoonbills from
the three different breeding provenances migrated sepa-
rately to winter in two different parts of China. The four
tagged birds that were marked in the Naoli River Basin
(Heilongjiang Province, China) all wintered in coastal
China (including around Yancheng, Lianyungang and Tai
Lake in Jiangsu Province; Fig. 2). The remaining six birds
caught at Uvs Lake (in western Mongolia) or Hulun Lake
(in eastern Inner Mongolia) wintered in the middle and
lower reaches of the Yangtze River floodplain, in Hubei, 
Jiangxi and Anhui Provinces (Fig. 3).
Autumn migration routes
We derived 13 complete autumn migrations from the
10 tagged Eurasian Spoonbills. Four tracked Eurasian
Spoonbills (ES01, ES02, ES03, ES04) captured along the
Naoli River Basin, Heilongjiang Province used Ussuri Bay
(Primorsky Krai, Russia), Kanghwa Bay (Inchon, South
Korea) or Haizhou Bay (Lianyungang, Jiangsu Prov-
ince, China) as stopover sites (Fig. 2; Additional file 1: 
Table S2) and wintered along the Jiangsu coast. The mean
migration distance was 2376 ± 161 km (standard devia-
tion, SD).
The group that overwintered in the Yangtze River
floodplain of China, originated from two different, but
more westerly summering areas. The single tagged Eur-
asian Spoonbill (ES05) from the Wulanor wetland on
Hulun Lake, Inner Mongolia departed and stopped at the
Daling River (Chaoyang, Liaoning Province, China) and
the Yellow River Delta in Bohai Bay during its autumn
migration, and wintered at Poyang Lake in the Yang-
tze River Basin (Fig. 3; Additional file 1: Table S2). The
migration distance was 2451 km. Complete migration
data were available from five individuals (ES06, ES07, 
ES08, ES09, ES10) marked at Uvs Lake in western Mon-
golia. These birds commenced autumn migration from
their summering habitat, stopping either in southern
Mongolia, in the Yellow River Basin (Inner Mongolia
and Shaanxi and Henan Provinces) or within the Yang-
tze River Basin (Hubei and Anhui Provinces). Of all these
staging areas, the Yellow River Basin formed the core area
for all the migration routes used by this group of birds
from western Mongolia. The wintering areas of these
birds were Poyang Lake (ES09), Dongting Lake (ES06, 
ES07), Liangzi Lake (ES08) and Caizi Lake (ES10) in the
Yangtze River Basin in 2018/2019 winter (Fig. 3; Table 1).
Their mean migration distance was 3466 ± 527 km (SD).
Unfortunately, the signal from ES09 was lost in Decem-
ber 2018 in Inner Mongolia, China, and ES10 died or lost
the transmitter in May 2019 in Anhui Province, China,

which was close to its wintering area. Data from the
remaining birds in subsequent years showed that these
birds summered at Uvs Lake (western Mongolia),  the
Zavkhan and Ider Rivers, with one individual spending
the summer on the Tuin River in central Mongolia (Fig. 3; 
Additional file 1: Table S2). 
Three tagged juveniles hatched in western Mongolia
(ES06, ES07, ES08) in 2018 changed their subsequent
summer location (Fig. 3; Additional file 1: Table S2).
In 2019, the three birds shifted their summer quar-
ters from western Mongolia to central Mongolia and
the Yellow River Basin (about 1300 km). Two of them

are derived from Xi (2021)
(ES07, ES08) also changed their wintering location
after autumn 2019. ES07 wintered at Dongting Lake, 
Hunan Province in the Yangtze in 2018/2019 but win-
tered in Henan Province in 2019/2020 (about 400 km
to the east; Additional file 2: Fig. S2). ES08 wintered on
Caizi Lake, Anhui Province in 2019/2020 winter after
wintering at Liangzi Lake, Hubei Province (although
both sites are within the Yangtze, c. 250 km apart) in
2018/2019 winter (Additional file 2: Fig. S3). In sum-
mary, all three surviving juveniles changed their sum-
mer places and shortened their migration distance.
Spring migration routes
We derived six complete spring migration episodes in
2019 from the ten Eurasian Spoonbills. Only two of the
tagged Eurasian Spoonbills, which wintered along the
coast at Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, survived to spring. 
They followed different spring migration routes but to 
the same ultimate summering area (along the Naoli River, 
near Shuangyashan City, Heilongjiang Province, China; 
Fig. 2; Table 1). ES01 flew along the coast, and staged for
2 days in Ussuri Bay (Primorsky Krai), Russia, while ES02
flew inland and staged for 22 days at Daqing and Kuerbin
Reservoirs in Yichun, Heilongjiang Province, China. The
mean migration distance was 2432 ± 590 km (SD).
The lone Inner Mongolian tagged individual, ES05, 
started its spring migration from its wintering site at Poy-
ang Lake in the Yangtze River Basin, and staged at Bohai
Bay and a reservoir in Tangshan, Hebei Province between
28 February and 12 April, before continuing back to
Hulun Lake via Pingyuan Reservoir (Hebei Province; 
Fig. 3; Table 1). The migration distance was 2452 km.
Of the western Mongolian tagged birds, ES06, ES07
and ES08 commenced spring migration from the Yang-
tze River Basin (Fig. 3; Table 2), ES06 stopped midway
in the Yellow River Basin (Shaanxi Province) for about
10 days, before returning to its summering area in the

Yellow River Basin, Bayannur, Inner Mongolia (Addi-
tional file 2: Figure S1). ES07 staged in the Yellow River
Basin (Shanxi Province) for about 15 days and 2 further
days in the southern Gobi region of Mongolia, finally
summering along the Tuin River in central Mongolia. 
ES08 flew from its Dongting Lake wintering site directly
to its summering place in the Yellow River Basin (Baotou, 
Inner Mongolia) without stopping (Fig. 3; Table 2). The
mean migration distance was 1897 ± 500 km (SD).
Autumn migration parameters
We summarized migration parameters in different
migration routes (Table 1), as we tagged only one bird in
Inner Mongolia, China, here we only make comparisons
between birds caught along the Naoli River in Heilongji-
ang Province, China, and those in western Mongolia.
Among these birds, autumn migration started from
late August to the end of October. Naoli River individu-
als left their summering area in mid-October, arriving
to their coastal Jiangsu Province wintering areas in late
November to mid-December. All Naoli River birds left
their breeding areas more or less simultaneously in 2016
between 19 and 22 October. Western Mongolian birds
left their summer areas earlier between 22 August and 5
October in 2017 and 2018. However, the same individu-
als left later in 2019, when they also arrived at their ulti-
mate wintering site significantly earlier in later October
compared to 2018, when almost all arrived in November. 
This was because they undertook a much shorter over-
all migration in that year, having summered at sites well
south of where they had previously been captured. In
2019, three western Mongolian individuals did not return
to their place of hatching, so their migration distance was
almost half of that in autumn 2018 (Table 1).
Naoli River birds undertook significantly shorter
migration routes than western Mongolian tagged birds
(Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P < 0.05) but the difference in
migration duration did not differ significantly (Table 3).
Western Mongolia tagged birds made twice the number
of stopovers taken by Naoli River birds (a statistically
significant difference, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P < 0.05) 
although the stopover duration did not differ significantly
between the two groups (Table 3).  Overall, migration
speed, daily travel speed and straightness index did not
differ between the two routes.
Spring migration parameters
The start of Far East Asian Eurasian Spoonbill spring
migration extended from mid-February to mid-May
(Table 2). Naoli River tagged individuals left their coastal
wintering area between 10 and 16 May and arrived at
their summering areas between 23 May and 15 June. 
Western Mongolian tagged birds started migration
between 1 and 17 May, arriving at the summering areas
between 2 May and 9 June (Table 2), which did not differ
significantly from Naoli River tagged individuals. Over-
all, migration distance, daily travel speed and straightness
index did not differ between the two routes.
In contrast, the single tagged in Inner Mongolia began
spring migration on 13 February and arrived at the sum-
mering area on 16 April (Table 2), a migration duration
of 61.4 days, significantly greater than all other individu-
als, due to more frequent stopovers and longer stopover
duration.
Stop sites
We identified 45 stop sites, including 35 during autumn
migration and 10 during spring migration. None of these
stop sites used in autumn were used as stop sites by any
individuals again in the following spring migration, sug-
gesting these were of less importance than stopover sites. 
Among them, Mongolia (11 sites) and Henan Province (7
sites), China, and Inner Mongolia (7 sites) of China were
the most used areas (Table 4).
Habitat use
Habitat use differed between migration routes (Figs. 4, 5, 
6; Additional file 1). Throughout the annual cycle, more
than 90% of habitat types used by Eurasian Spoonbills
tracked in Naoli River were wetlands and open waters
combined. The same was true for the single Inner Mon-
golian tagged bird, except at spring stopover areas, where
it exploited 49% cropland. Western Mongolian tagged
birds used 19–25% cropland throughout the year and
34% grassland in summer, proportionally less open water
(varying between 74% in winter and 31% in summer).
Use of protected areas
All tagged individuals used spring stopover sites that
lacked protection (Fig. 7; Additional file 1: Table S4).
Naoli River and the Inner Mongolian birds used sites
throughout the rest of their annual life cycle which
seemed well protected (> 49%). Birds tagged in western
Mongolia also exploited areas that were relatively poorly
protected (19–21% for summering and wintering areas, 
but only 5% for autumn stopover areas).
Naoli River tagged Eurasian Spoonbills spent 73.0% of
time on summering sites located within protected areas
(Fig. 7; Additional file 1: Table S4), mostly in the Naoli
River and Sanjiang National Nature Reserves. Dur-
ing autumn migration, these birds spent 62.0% of their
stopover time within the Xingkai Lake National Nature
Reserves, and 80.9% of time on wintering sites within the
Yancheng National Nature Reserve.

The tracked Inner Mongolia Eurasian Spoonbill spent
94.8% of time within protected areas during the sum-
mer period (Fig. 7; Additional file 1: Table S4), almost all
within the Hulun Lake and Hui River National Nature
Reserves. During autumn stopovers, 48.5% of positions
were located within Yellow River Delta National Nature
Reserve, and 70.8% in winter period, the majority from
the Poyang Lake National Nature Reserve (Fig. 7; Addi-
tional file 1: Table S4).
Tracking positions from western Mongolia Eurasian
Spoonbills on the summering grounds were relatively
rarely (19.2%) from within Uvs Nuur Basin Biosphere
Reserve and Valley of Lake Reserve, and just 4.9% of the
sites used as autumn stopover sites fell within Ordos Rel-
ict Gull National Nature Reserve. In winter, 21.8% of the
sites were located in protected areas, mainly within East
Dongting Lake National Nature Reserve, Shengjin Lake
National Nature Reserve, Poyang Lake National Nature
Reserve and Tongling Freshwater Dolphin National
Nature Reserve.
Discussion
We used satellite tracking technology for the first time
to reveal migration routes of Eurasian Spoonbills winter-
ing in China and to highlight total separation in migra-
tion routes in spring and autumn between coastal and
inland wintering birds of differing breeding provenances. 
Although our sample size is modest, it appears that Eura-
sian Spoonbills wintering in the freshwater Yangtze River
Wetlands breed further to the west into western Mongo-
lia steppe than spoonbills wintering in coastal wetlands
in China and these sets of birds have migration routes 
and important stopovers that appear independent of each
other.
Although these results come from the first telemetry
tagging of this species in Far East Asia, we should be pru-
dent about concluding too much from so few individu-
als from relatively few sites and from relative few years. 
For example, the majority of Eurasian Spoonbills marked
in this study were caught as juveniles, which are highly
unlikely to behave as adults. Eurasian Spoonbills breed
first when aged three years old, and studies show that
adult birds are more loyal to their breeding area than the
young birds, which may summer well away from natal
areas (Lok et al. 2011). This was very evident from our
data, which showed that several of our tagged Eurasian
Spoonbills returned in spring along their autumn corri-
dor, but did not travel all the way to their natal summer-
ing area, stopping short in wetlands well to the south
of the original nesting areas. Hence, three tagged birds
(ES06, ES07, ES08) marked as birds of the juveniles failed
to return to their place of hatching the following spring.
There is also evidence from studies of Eurasian Spoon-
bills in other parts of the range that birds are more likely
to change their wintering area in their second winter
(Lok et al. 2011), and juvenile birds are more likely to
disperse and exploit new habitats (Pigniczki and Vegvari
2015), which is consistent with our results. Clearly, we
need many more replicates of such individual tracking
to gather more evidence on levels of breeding and winter
site fidelity before we can judge the loyalty of individuals
to specific sites throughout the annual cycle, especially
how this change with age and pairing status. Although
most individuals followed very similar migration routes
between breeding and wintering areas, the precise routes

Fig. 6  Habitat use of western Mongolia-Yangtze River individuals
(n = 2) in the summering area of the Yellow River Basin
taken by one individual in spring and autumn differed
substantially. According to a study conducted in win-
tering areas (Sullender et al. 2016), Eurasian Spoonbills
spent 36.4% of their time foraging, and they prefer for-
aging areas with water depths of 28.1–36.6 cm. Hence, 
it is possible that the young birds changed their habitats
simply to seek better foraging areas, although how much
this was due to inexperience, poor weather conditions or
the need to follow different routes in different seasons
remains unknown until it is possible to chart many more
such migration routes to confirm the frequency of such
patterns.
It is extremely difficult to draw meaningful conclusions
about migration timing and speed from so few tracked
individuals, but the duration of migration stopovers of
our tracked sample was highly variable. Stopover dura-
tion is likely related to the body condition of the individ-
ual and the feeding opportunities to which it is exposed
in time and space. Comparing data on autumn migration
duration, stopover duration and migration speed, the sin-
gle Inner Mongolia bird took longer to complete autumn
migration than those that took the other two migration
routes. This individual also visited more stopover sites
with longer stopover time on spring migration compared
to those using other routes. However, we urgently need
data from more tagged individuals before we can con-
clude that differences in stopover frequency and overall
migration speed are due to differences in migration strat-
egy or in the quality and availability of suitable habitat
of birds following these different routes. Nevertheless, 
it does seem the case that across all migration routes, 
migration duration in autumn was longer, mainly due
to prolonged stopover durations, than in spring, which
is consistent with the Oriental Stork (Ciconia neomycin)
(Fan et al. 2020) and the classical theory (Kokko 1999).
In a study of Central European populations (Pigniczki
et al. 2016), the stopover duration of autumn migration 
(mean ± SD = 5.7 ± 1.0 days) was longer than that of
spring migration (3.9 ± 1.2 days), which is similar to our
results, although our migration durations were much
longer (Tables 1 and 2). However, the difference showed
in the study was not statistically significant and clear, 
and we need more tracking studies to confirm these pat-
terns and determine the mechanisms that shape them.
The closely-related and globally threatened Black-
faced Spoonbill (Platalea minor;  Sung et al. 2018; Yu
et al. 2020) shows similar migration patterns to Eura-
sian Spoonbills. The Black-faced Spoonbill is currently
confined to East and Southeast Asia (Carey et al. 2001).
Satellite tracking studies (Jung et al. 2018; Jia et al. 
2020; Son et al. 2020) found that Black-faced Spoonbills
began to migrate in autumn from mid-October to mid-
November, undertaking a maximum migration distance
of 1820 km. The longest migration duration for that spe-
cies was 34 days. The Black-faced Spoonbills usually use
1 to 3 stopover sites during migration, where they remain
for 1 to 2 days (although up to 31 days; Y.W. Chen et al. 
2021). These are especially similar to the migration habits
shown by the Eurasian Spoonbills captured at the Naoli
River. We currently know little about the potential for
competition and other interactions between these two
specialist waterbirds and it would be interesting in the
future to compare the migration, diet, habitat use, and
ecological niche overlap between Eurasian Spoonbill and
Black-faced Spoonbill. Tracking studies of other Ciconii-
formes species show contrasting strategies, for instance, 
Polish tagged Night Herons (Nycticorax nycticorax) were
found to spend longer periods (mean 17 days) at each of
their migration stopover sites (Ledwoń and Betleja 2015),
while tracked Grey Herons (Ardea cinerea) migrated
without stopovers (Ye et al. 2018). The reasons behind
the differences in frequency and duration of migration
stopovers between these species in relation to their food
availability need further exploration.
We found 45 stop sites where the stop duration was
less than 2 days. These stop durations were not long, so
although we might consider they were exploratory, for
drinking, resting or preening, it is possible that such halts
during migration could potentially also be important for
the birds to replenish energy during the migration pro-
cess. Although ES08 did not stop at all during the spring
migration, all other individuals stopped frequently dur-
ing both of their migrations, perhaps because they did
not accumulate sufficient energy stores on their stopo-
ver sites, wintering or summering areas to sustain them
during migration, or simply because they were sam-
pling potential stopover sites along the route. It is per-
haps relevant that ES10 probably died next to a fish pond
on the wintering area in May 2019, which might reflect

represent individual positions of birds marked in western Mongolia; yellow dots represent the bird marked in Inner Mongolia; red dots represent

lack of energy stores and an inability to locally replenish
these in this bird.
Not surprisingly, Eurasian Spoonbills predominantly
utilize water and wetland habitats throughout the annual 
cycle. This is consistent with the feeding habits used by
Eurasian Spoonbills, which mainly forage on fish and
crustaceans (Aguilera et al. 1996) and their general behav-
ior that also involves resting, preening and indulging in
Page 15
Xi   et al. Avian Research (2021) 12:70  Page 15 of 17
social activities in shallow water (Lok et al. 2013; Sullen-
der et al. 2016). What is interesting is the degree to which
some of the tagged birds exploited croplands. Many
areas in Yellow River and Yangtze River Basins support
intensive rice production, which requires intensive irriga-
tion and a reliable source of water supply that inevitably
means such areas are associated with major floodplains, 
rivers and wetlands. Two of the sub-adult birds from the
western Mongolian breeding area that summered in the
Yellow River Basin (Fig. 6) showed highest rates of use of
cropland (40.0%), followed by grassland (32.7%) and open
water (15.0%). Birds from the western Mongolian breed-
ing areas also used croplands and grassland in winter
in the Yangtze River Basin as well. While such behavior
flexibility suggests an adaptability to exploit novel food
resources in new artificial habitats, the use of agricultural
habitats is likely to expose Eurasian Spoonbills more to
the effects of pesticides and contaminants than perhaps
would be the case in natural floodplain wetlands. The use
of such artificial habitats may also be an indication of the
local loss and/or degradation of natural wetland ecosys-
tems along the network of sites these birds use in their
annual cycle.
There is no doubt that the Eurasian Spoonbill enjoys
better conservation status than the Black-faced Spoon-
bill, because of its wider geographical distribution and
abundance. These results have also shown a greater com-
plexity in potential biogeographical population structure
and diversity in breeding provenance and migration cor-
ridors that also suggest a greater robustness to ecologi-
cal change than the rarer species. However, this does not
imply that Eurasian Spoonbills are not threatened in East
Asia, especially as the results of our tracking underline
deficiencies in the protected areas network to adequately
safeguard sites and habitats used by all Chinese winter-
ing birds. The finding that some birds are highly reliant
upon croplands also poses questions about the long-
term viability of these patterns that need further inves-
tigation. We also emphasise that these results stem from
tagged juveniles marked on breeding areas, which likely
have relatively low survival rates and introduce sources
of bias, as we have discussed above. For these reasons we
urge further tracking of individuals of all ages, improved
wintering surveys to effectively track populations and
more ecological studies to determine the food and habi-
tat requirements of the species in this part of its range, to
better support the effective protection of this iconic spe-
cies in the future.
Overall, while the degree of existing protection for sites
used by our tagged Eurasian Spoonbills was adequate, 
there is room for considerable improvement. The sites
used by the birds in spring were generally less well pro-
tected than at other points in the annual cycle and this 
could merit further research. Although the spring migra-
tion is relatively rapid and the stopover duration time
relatively short, it may be that these areas are of dispro-
portional importance to birds preparing for onward
migration and, in the case of adults, ultimately preparing
to breed. In particular, birds travelling towards the Inner
Mongolian breeding areas stopped for prolonged peri-
ods in the Yellow River Delta, where they were almost
exclusively active outside the boundary of the protected
areas. We would urge more survey work on the ground
to understand the foraging behaviour, feeding habitat use
and roosting areas for these birds to better implement
local conservation management and particularly pro-
tected area designation to plug this gap in the protection
of this species throughout the annual cycle. We recom-
mend further research on Eurasian Spoonbill habitat use
and site protection in the future, combining remote sens-
ing, telemetry and field observation.
Conclusions
This study revealed for the first time the migration
routes, stopover patterns and habitat use of Chinese win-
tering populations of the Eurasian Spoonbill throughout
the annual cycle. We are painfully aware of the limitation
of the sample size of just ten individuals, so it is clear that
we require much further research to determine winter
and summer site fidelity of different age classes and the
discreteness of the migration corridors that we describe
here. We urge continued combined field surveys, long-
term color-banding scheme and satellite tracking to
describe the migration patterns of a far greater sample of
individuals to better illuminate the degree of separation
of birds using different migration corridors between dis-
crete breeding and summering areas and their respective
winter quarters.
