Abstract 
Background:  The Black-faced Spoonbill (Platalea minor) is a globally threatened species, nesting mainly in western
Korea with smaller numbers breeding in Liaoning Province, China, and Far East Russia. Recent winter field surveys to
estimate the species’ population size were almost totally conducted in coastal areas, but tracking studies showed that
some individuals now winter inland. To ensure its long-term survival, we need a more comprehensive assessment of
the current distribution and abundance of the species.
Methods:  We combined the most recent count data and satellite tracking information to update existing informa‑
tion about the population abundance and distribution of the Black-faced Spoonbill at all stages of its annual life cycle, 
and how these have changed during 2004–2020.
Results:  Black-faced Spoonbills mainly breed on the west coast of the Korean peninsula, while immature birds show
a wider summer distribution throughout Yellow Sea coastal areas, when a few remain on wintering sites in the south. 
Combined tracking results and mid-winter counts confirmed known wintering sites on the east and south coasts of
China, but showed that the species also winters on wetlands in the Yangtze River floodplain and in Southeast Asia. 
During 2004–2020, counts of wintering birds in coastal habitats increased from 1198 to 4864, with numbers wintering
on the island of Taiwan contributing most to the overall increase. Latest counts found 5222 in 2021. We also identify
key wintering and stopover sites as well as their current conservation status.
Conclusions:  This study revised the known summering and wintering ranges of the Black-faced Spoonbill and
assessed the conservation status of key sites based on a combination of field survey and satellite tracking data. 
We recommend prioritisation of further field research to identify and survey inland wintering areas in the Yangtze
River floodplain and summering areas of immature birds. More tracking of adult individuals and birds during spring
migration is necessary to fill these information gaps. We also suggest establishing a Black-faced Spoonbill monitoring
platform to store, share and show real-time distribution range and population abundance data.

Background
The Black-faced Spoonbill (Platalea minor) is a globally
threatened waterbird, which breeds mainly on the west
coast of the Korean Peninsula (Kang et al. 2016), with
small numbers breeding in Liaoning Province, China
(Ding et al. 2000) and Far East Russia (Shibaev 2010). It
winters in coastal areas of south and southeast Chinese
mainland, on Taiwan and Hainan in China, western
Japan, and Southeast Asia (BirdLife International and
Handbook of the Birds of the World 2019), constituting
just one biogeographical population (Wetlands Interna-
tional 2020).
Black-faced Spoonbills were considered relatively com-
mon prior to the 1950s, but the population declined
during the Korean War, because of the destruction
of breeding sites and subsequent pollution of habi-
tats, thought to be caused by pesticide use (Yeung et al. 
2006).  In 1980s, the global population numbered less
than 300 individuals (Kennerley 1989), and the species
was designated as “Critically Endangered” by Interna-
tional Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1994
(BirdLife International and Handbook of the Birds of the
World 2017). Conservation efforts, including consider-
able investment in site protection during 1997–2014, 
increased the population of Black-faced Spoonbills from
535 to 2726 individuals (Sung et al. 2018), and the threat-
ened category was down-listed to “Endangered” in 2000
(BirdLife International and Handbook of the Birds of the
World 2017). During the 2021 global synchronous census
coordinated by the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society
(HKBWS), the number of wintering Black-faced Spoon-
bills reached a new maximum of 5222 individuals (Yu
et al. 2021).
Besides the census, the first satellite tracking research
was also initiated in 1998 in order to locate previously
undiscovered breeding grounds, migration routes and
stopover sites (Ueta et al. 2002) and further studies were
undertaken in the 2010s (Wood et al. 2013; Jung et al. 
2018; Jia et al. 2020; Son et al. 2020). Results from these
latter studies revealed that immature individuals could
remain on inland habitats during winter, indicating that
the midwinter count focusing almost entirely on coastal
areas could miss some individuals wintering inland.
Black-faced Spoonbills are sensitive to human dis-
turbance (Ding et al. 2000; Zhang et al. 2010), while cli-
mate change and habitat loss together also threaten the
recovery of the population (Pickett et al. 2018). Although
recent studies have revealed valuable information about 
population size and trends, distribution, and the migra-
tion routes of the Black-faced Spoonbills, we still need
more knowledge relating to the important sites used by
the species throughout the annual cycle and their con-
servation status. It is especially important for us to (1) 
understand the distribution of the Black-faced Spoonbill
throughout the annual cycle, and (2) confirm whether
current levels of site protection are adequate to secure
the population for the future. Here, we attempt to pro-
vide new information in the current analysis to fulfil
these two objectives.
Methods
Information sources
Count data
We derived census information from recent waterbird
field surveys and from published information to establish
the full distributional range and abundance of the Black-
faced Spoonbill at different points in its annual cycle. The
information included figures from the synchronized sur-
veys conducted by the Hong Kong Bird Watching Soci-
ety (HKBWS) during 2004–2020 (Sung et al. 2018; Yu
et al. 2020), synchronized Yangtze waterbird surveys in
2004, 2005, 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (Cao et al. 2010),
and records in published scientific papers. The synchro-
nized HKBWS surveys presented only count figures from
major wintering sites (which are known to comprise at
least 90% of the total numbers recorded during the cen-
sus) from 2004 to 2020. Synchronized Yangtze waterbird
surveys were undertaken during mid-January to early
February, which are considered to cover the majority of
the possible wintering sites of Black-faced Spoonbills in
inland China (Yu and Swennen 2005; Cao et al. 2010).
Other field survey results and satellite tracking results
were obtained from published articles by searching the
internet ([URL: "http://www.cnki.net"] www.​cnki.​net; apps.webofknowledge.com; sci-
hub.org.cn) with key words (“black-faced spoonbill” or
“black-faced spoonbills” or “Platalea minor”) (Additional
file 1: Table S1).
Telemetry data
Telemetry data analyzed and presented here from all
available studies derive from 34 different tagged individu-
als. These include 24 complete autumn migration routes
from 24 birds caught at Chinese and South Korean breed-
ing sites and 10 complete spring migration routes from
10 birds caught at two key wintering sites on Taiwan and
Hong Kong in China (see Additional file 1: Table S2 for
Page 3
Chen   et al. Avian Research (2021) 12:74  Page 3 of 17
detail information on individuals and Additional file 1: 
Table S3 for data summaries from tracking studies).
Analysis
We created new distribution maps based on the infor-
mation from recent field surveys and tracking studies, 
overlaying these upon the distribution map generated by
BirdLife International and Handbook of the Birds of the
World (2019) within an ArcGIS 10.6 environment.
We used the telemetry results and data from field
surveys on the wintering areas (Jin et al. 2009), breed-
ing areas (Lee et al. 2001; Kang et al. 2016) and stopover
areas (Yuan and Zhang 2006) to define different periods
of the annual cycle (see “Results” below). Based on the
information from the literature, we assigned birds using
sites during the defined wintering period (December–
February, see “Results” below) to wintering sites. Breed-
ing sites were defined based upon direct observation of
birds’ breeding behavior or movements to and from colo-
nies interpreted from tracking data. Other sites occupied
by birds during the period defined as summer (between
May and September; see “Results” below), in the absence
of evidence of breeding were noted as summering sites. 
We also present a tentative map of possible migration
routes based on the combined results from the telemetry
studies.
We attempted to assess the total current population
size and the trends in abundance within some larger geo-
graphical units in recent years based on the HKBWS’s
synchronized survey results from mid-winter counts
carried out during 2004–2020, and supplemented by
additional information from other sources. Population
abundance and trends were analyzed by grouping indi-
vidual sites as follows: Yangtze River Delta (including
Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Province), Fujian Coast, 
Pearl River Delta (including Hong Kong, Macau and
Guangdong Province), Hainan, on the island of Taiwan
and in Japan, Korea, Philippines, Thailand and Red River
Delta of Vietnam.
Internationally important wintering sites were deter-
mined based on the average of total winter counts from
2016 to 2020 (the past 5 years, according to the Ramsar
criterion; Ramsar 2007),  for identifying important key
sites (defined as supporting > 5% of the population) and
regular key sites (> 1% of the population; Damba et al. 
2020). We arbitrarily defined key stopover sites as those
used by more than 0.25% of the total wintering counts or
that supported staging tagged individuals for more than
7 days. In five cases [two reported by Liu (2006) and three
reported by Son et al. (2020)], it was not clear precisely
how long birds had remained at stopover sites, so these
were estimated in Table 1. To assess the current protec-
tion status of these key sites based on the definitions 
above, we downloaded the boundary information from
the World Database of Protected Areas (WDPA, [URL: "https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/thematic-areas/wdpa"] https://​
 www.​prote​ctedp​lanet.​net/​en/​thema​tic-​areas/​wdpa) and
National Nature Reserves (NNRs, [URL: "http://www.resdc.cn/data.aspx?DATAID=272"] http://​www.​resdc.​cn/​
 data.​aspx?​DATAID=​272) with permissions. We then
overlaid all the key wintering sites using ArcGIS 10.6 to
identify which sites were located within WDPA and NNR
boundaries. However, during this process we also became
aware that the boundary information held in WDPA did
not reflect the true protected area boundaries in a very
few cases. For this reason, we asked the opinion of local
experts to define the precise geographical extent of pro-
tection status for a few sites, e.g., the Deep Bay area of
Hong Kong.
Results
Distribution
From the results presented here, we can add a breeding
site in South Korea (Chilsando Islet; Kang et al. 2016) 
revealed by field surveys, and summering sites revealed
by telemetry tracking, including Yancheng NNR in
Jiangsu Province, China (Ueta et al. 2002). These results
confirm that all the known summering sites are exclu-
sively coastal and restricted to South Korea, China, and
Russia (Fig. 1).
Tracking results from 11 individuals showed birds
wintering in other previously less known areas. These
include: Yancheng NNR in Jiangsu Province (Jia et al. 
2020); Hangzhou Bay and Taizhou Bay in Zhejiang Prov-
ince (Jung et al. 2018); Yangtze River floodplain [Poyang

Funing Bay of Fujian Coast (Son et al. 2020) and Luoyuan
Bay and Xiamen (Jung et al. 2018), all in Fujian Province; 
and Tra-sur Flooded Forest on the border of Vietnam
and Cambodia (Wood et al. 2013). Based on HKBWS
field survey results, Black-faced Spoonbills also winter
on Batanes Island and Panpang in Philippines and Phet-
chaburi in Thailand (Yu et al. 2020). With the exception
of the inland freshwater Yangtze River floodplain and
the Tra-sur Flooded Forest, all other wintering areas are
maritime coastal East Asian habitats (Fig. 1).
The results suggest the inclusion of the south coast of
South Korea and the coastal area east to the Han River in
South Korea (Kim and Kim 2005) as part of the staging
areas, as well as parts of Shandong Province (Yellow River
Delta; Shan et al. 2005) and Zhejiang Province (Hang-
zhou Bay; Jin et al. 2017) in China. Telemetry tracking
data also revealed stopover sites on the southeast coast
of Shandong Province (Rongcheng and Jiaozhou Bay; Jia
et al. 2020) and Jiangsu Province (Linhong Esturay; Jia

other newly located stopover sites were in marine coastal
areas (Fig. 2).
Migration routes and timing
We present a tentative map of possible migration routes
based on the combined results of the telemetry studies
in Fig. 3, based on 34 migration routes from 34 differ-
ent individuals. Black-faced Spoonbills usually migrate 
along the coast of southwest South Korea and in East
China, occasionally along river floodplains, as in the
case of the Yangtze River. According to telemetry data
from the literature, first-year birds initiated their autumn
migration from mid-October to mid-November (Octo-
ber 13–November 14; mean = October 29; SD = 8 days) 
and arrived to winter quarters in late October to early
December (October 15–December 7; mean = November
8; SD = 14 days). The average duration of autumn migra-
tion was 9 days (SD = 10 days, range 2–34, n = 21 birds;

Fig. 1  Revised distribution map of the Black faced Spoonbill (Platalea minor) in East Asia. Summering areas (the west coast of Korean Peninsula, and
Xingren Island in Liaoning and Yancheng NNR in Jiangsu Province, China, and Furugelma Island in Russia) are shaded green. Wintering ranges (the
west coast of Japan, Jeju Island in South Korea, the east and south coast of China, Yangtze River floodplain, Taiwan of China, Red River Delta and
south coast in Vietnam, south coast in Cambodia, south in Thailand and north in Philippines) are shaded blue. Distributions are shown modified
from previous maps from BirdLife International and Handbook of Birds of the World (2019, shown as hatching and cross-hatching). Revisions to
summer and winter ranges are based on tracking data from the literature (red triangles denote GPS points from when each individual arrived and
when they departed the summering and wintering grounds) and field surveys data (yellow circles, including data from Hong Kong Bird Watching
Society and data from literature, while Yangtze waterbird survey points were not shown because no Black-faced Spoonbills were counted, see
“Methods” for details). All the summering and wintering site/area names mentioned in the paper are shown on the map
Jung et al. 2018; Jia et al. 2020; Son et al. 2020). Based on
these tracking results and field survey results (Additional
file 1: Table S1), we defined the autumn migration period
of Black-faced Spoonbills as October to November inclu-
sive, although a very few individuals started their move-
ments before and continued after this period.
Adult Black-faced Spoonbills started spring migration
from mid-March to mid-April (March 15 to April 13; 
mean = March 30; SD = 12 days) and arrived from late
March to early May (March 31 to May 4; mean = April
14; SD = 12 days). The average migration duration was
16 days (SD = 6 days, range 9–24, n = 6 birds; Ueta
et al. 2002).  Juveniles started spring migration from
late April to late May (April 23 to May 18; mean = May
7; SD = 11 days),  and arrived from mid-May to mid-
June (May 10 to June 16; mean = May 30; SD = 17 days).
Average migration duration was 22 days (SD = 13 days, 
range 4–33, n = 4 birds; Ueta et al. 2002). Based on these 
tracking results and field survey results (Additional file 1: 
Table S1),  we defined the spring migration in adults
as March and April, but in juveniles March to May, for
whom the summering period was May to September. 
The wintering period was defined as December to Febru-
ary inclusive and we thus defined the summer, wintering
range and migration staging range according to the distri-
bution of where tracked birds were during these periods. 
The migration routes of the Black-faced Spoonbills con-
nected the summering sites (Korean Peninsula), stopover
sites (east coast of China) and wintering sites (from the
southeast coast of China to the south of Philippines and
Vietnam) and are based on the results of tracking studies.
Twenty-four immature birds were tracked from
breeding sites, including 18 from the main breed-
ing sites in South Korea, and 6 from those in China, 
although no tracking data were available from Russia. 
Six of them wintered in inland China, mainly in Yangtze

of Korean Peninsula and northeast of Han River, East China, including the Yellow River Delta in Shandong Province, and the coastal area from
Rongcheng, Shandong Province to Pearl River Delta). The distribution is based on data mapped by BirdLife International and Handbook of Birds of
the World (2019, indicated by hatching) updated based on data presented here. The revised stopover range is based on tracking data (red triangles
denoting GPS points generated during the stopover period) and field surveys data (yellow circles, see “Methods” for details) from literature. All the

River floodplain; 18 wintered in coastal areas, including
Yangtze River Delta, Fujian Coast, Pearl River Delta, on
the island of Taiwan, and Japan. From these tracking, 
the Yangtze River Delta and Yangtze floodplain and the
wintering site on the Vietnam/Cambodia border were
previously unknown as regular wintering sites (Fig. 1).
From wintering sites in China, four birds (two adults, 
two juveniles) were tracked from Taiwan and six from
Hong Kong (four adults, two juveniles). All six adults
summered at the Gyeonggi Bay breeding site, but
among the four juveniles, only one summered in the
breeding range (Namph in North Korea),  while the
other three summered at known non-breeding sites
(one on Taiwan and two in Yangtze River Delta). The
lack of segregation among these tracking results con-
necting breeding and wintering ranges supports the
current hypothesis that there is only one biogeographi-
cal population of this species, until further tracking
data can show to the contrary. 
Abundance estimates and trends
According to the HKBWS survey results, the population
of the Black-faced Spoonbill increased by 300%,  from
about 1200 to 4864 during 2004 to 2020 (Yu et al. 2020).
Since 2004, over 50% of the Black-faced Spoonbills win-
tered on Taiwan (with the exceptions of 48% in 2007 and
47% in 2011) and these numbers contributed most to the
increase of the overall population total. However, the
period 2017–2020 also saw a rapid increase in numbers
wintering on the Min and Yangtze River Deltas, while
numbers wintering on the Pearl River Delta and in Japan
have also maintained a steady increase (Table 2; Figs. 4
and 5).
Key sites during the annual life cycle
Summering period
From the literature search, we derived a total of 19
records of Black-faced Spoonbills from 9 sites during
the summering period (Additional file 1: Tables S1, S3)

including 8 from South Korea, 8 in China, 2 in Russia and

ing sites: Gyeonggi Bay and Chilsando Islet in South
Korea, Xingren Island and Yuanbao Island in China, and
Furugelma Island in Russia, whereas Gyeonggi Bay had
the highest number of breeding individuals of 652 birds
(Table 3). Of these sites, Gyeonggi Bay is within WDPA; 
sites used in Chilsando Islet are partially protected; Xin-
gren Island and Yuanbao Island are protected by provin-
cial government, while Furugelma Island lies outside the
known reserve boundaries (Fig. 6a).
Wintering period
Key wintering sites were defined on 5% and 1% thresh-
olds derived from the overall population estimate of 4113
birds, based on average total counts from the annual cen-
sus during 2016–2020 (Yu et al. 2020). Nineteen interna-
tionally important wintering sites (based on the criterion
that they supported more than 1% population at least
once since 2004, rounded to a threshold of 40 birds) were 
identified based on the maximum counts during 2004–
2020 censuses. These comprised 5 important key sites
(supporting > 5% of the population, 200 birds) and 14
regular key sites (1–5%, 40–200 birds) (Fig. 6b). These 5
important key sites were: Taijiang National Park, Chiayi
and Kaoshiung on Taiwan, Xinghua Bay in Fujian, and
Deep Bay in Hong Kong and the adjacent Shenzhen. Of
all these 19 key wintering sites, 12 sites are currently pro-
tected. Seven sites are within WDPA boundaries or NNR
boundaries. The Deep Bay area of Hong Kong is partially
protected. Haifeng in Guangdong Province, Dongfang
in Hainan Province, Taipa-coloane in Macau, and Chi-
ayi on Taiwan are located within a state protected area
(Table 4).
Autumn and spring migration periods
There were 47 records providing some dated informa-
tion about stopover sites (Table 5). Chongming Island
in Shanghai (Yangtze River Delta) and Xinghua Bay in
Fujian Province were the most intensively used stopover

The ten regions were identified based on the distribution of the surveyed wintering sites during 2004–2020 conducted by HKBWS. Counts of Yangtze River Delta
includes counts of Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Province in China; counts of Fujian Coast includes counts of Fujian Province in China; counts of Pearl River Delta
includes counts of Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong Province in China
sites. Numbers staging at the Yellow River Delta from
2002 to 2005 might have decreased during these years, 
but long-term regular monitoring activities at this site
were lacking. The most recent records (110 birds in
October and 142 birds in December) were 2 total counts
from 7 sites along the Zhejiang coast in 2016. Twenty-
three key sites were identified by meeting the threshold
of 0.25% population and staging for 7 days from the field
survey results and satellite tracking data. Among these
sites, 4 were located within NNR boundaries: Yellow
River Delta, Yancheng NNR, Chongming Island and Min
River Estuary (Fig. 6c, d).
Data from 24 tracked individuals revealed 26 autumn
stopover sites (Fig. 7),  of which 7 sites were used for
8–31 days (based on maximum possible stopover dura-
tion), 9 sites for the staging of 2–7 days, and 10 sites for
staging of one day only. Chongming Island of Shanghai
recorded the highest number of tracked individuals (9),
followed by 3 individuals at Yancheng NNR of Jiangsu
Province and 2 at Luoyuan Bay of Fujian Province.
Discussion
In this paper, we integrated data from field surveys and
satellite tracking studies to refine the existing distribu-
tion range of the Black-faced Spoonbill, identified some
new key sites and reviewed the conservation status of
these sites. We recommend including Yellow Sea coastal
areas (e.g., the Yancheng NNR in Jiangsu Province; Fig. 1) 
within the summer range of this species. We also found
that Black-faced Spoonbills were reported summering in
the Min River Estuary (several immature birds; Liu 2006) 
and Yilan, Taiwan (one tracked immature; Ueta et al. 
2002), but consultation with local experts confirmed that
these records were too few and irregular to justify includ-
ing these sites as summering sites. Historically, Longtan
Reservoir (Liaoning Province) was reported to be used
by a dozen Black-faced Spoonbills in March 1993 (Qiu
2007a), but as this site lies well away from the known
migration routes and the information is relatively old, 
this site was not included in the analysis of this study. 
Further survey is needed to confirm whether Black-faced
Spoonbills still occur regularly there in the absence of
recent records.
We also suggest the inclusion of wetlands on the east
coast of China within the regular wintering area of this
species. The Yangtze River floodplain wetlands need
more surveys to elucidate the true status of the winter-
ing Black-faced Spoonbills. Satellite tracking results in
conjunction with a few isolated ground observations
(e.g.,  Yu and Swennen 2005) showed that Black-faced
Spoonbills could be found in freshwater inland habitats
during the winter (Table 6, Fig. 3).  With the increas-
ing trend in the wintering population of this species, it
could be speculated that new wintering flocks could be
found there in the future (Wood et al. 2013). Records in
these inland freshwater habitats gives us a hint that some

provided courtesy of the HKBWS. b Same figures excluding Taiwan shown in smaller scale (< 800 individuals) for better clarity of smaller count
figures
fledging Black-faced Spoonbills could mix with the con-
generic Eurasian Spoonbills (Platalea leucorodia) win-
tering in this area which were counted in large numbers
(Additional file 1: Table S4), as both these species have
already been reported together using freshwater habitats
in inland wintering sites (Yu and Swennen 2005; Wood
et al. 2013; Sullender et al. 2016). Public awareness of
the Black-faced Spoonbill should be raised among the
waterbird surveyors, wetland managers and birdwatch-
ing communities in these areas to alert them to the pos-
sibility of their occurrence in these previously unusual
wintering areas. Local ornithologists might not be aware
that the Black-faced Spoonbill, thought to be a coastal
species, could also be found in these freshwater habitats, 
and that single individuals have the potential to be mixed
in with the larger wintering flocks of Eurasian Spoonbills. 
In addition, hybridization between the two species makes
it possible that a certain proportion of hybrid individu-
als exist in Eurasian Spoonbill colonies on the mainland. 
Since observed hybrid individuals appear very similar to
Black-faced Spoonbills (Kwon et al. 2017; Tiunov 2021),
careful monitoring is necessary in both breeding and
wintering areas to determine their numbers and distribu-
tion throughout the range. Local observers and research-
ers should also be encouraged to report sightings of
Black-faced Spoonbills to the international coordinator
of the annual Black-faced Spoonbill winter census, as this
will extend census coverage and improve our assessment

In South Korea, Gyeonggi Bay area currently falls within existing protected area boundaries and sites used in Chilsando Islet are partially protected. In China, Yuanbao
Island and Xingren Island are shown as provincial protected areas. The partially and locally protected areas were not within the current national protected area
boundary

Summering = May–September, including four breeding sites (Yuanbao Island is very close to Xingren Island so here are combined as one site, 
labelled Xingren Island). b Wintering = December–February, including 19 internationally important sites, 5 important key sites (> 5% of the
2016–2020 wintering counts, 200) and 14 regular key sites (1–5%, 40–200). c Autumn Migration = October–November, including 9 key sites (used
by more than ten birds, the 0.25% of the average of the 2016–2020 wintering counts, 10 birds, or used by tagged individuals for more than 7
consecutive days). d Spring Migration = March–April or May, including 4 key sites (the definition is the same as the Autumn Migration period).
Revised summering, wintering, and stopover ranges are shaded in green, blue and light purple, respectively
of the total population size. Given that the Black-faced
Spoonbill population is expanding (based on the results
of the winter census), further expansion of its wintering
range into the wetlands along the Yangtze River remains
highly likely in the future (Wood et al. 2013; Takano et al. 
2014). Migratory waterbirds are known to show explora-
tory behavior during migration and colonize new staging
and wintering areas (Baker 1980; Jansen 1981; Galvan
et al. 2003). Black-faced Spoonbills have been reported
migrating in age-specific groups (Ueta and Higuchi 2002; 
Wood et al. 2013), and since all birds tracked on autumn
migration were immature birds (Wood et al. 2013; Jung
et al. 2018; Jia et al. 2020; Son et al. 2020), their migration
(thought independent of adults) may explain such explor-
atory patterns. 
One major drawback of recent tracking studies of
Black-faced Spoonbills is that results are heavily biased
towards those from trapped and tracked fledglings, 
because they were more easily caught than the adults
on the breeding sites (e.g., Wood et al. 2013; Son et al. 
2020). Hence, information about the movements of indi-
viduals of other age groups, i.e., subadults and adults are
still lacking, despite Ueta et al. (2002) tracking six adults
to study their spring migration in 1999. Data retrieved
from immature birds showed them not returning to the
breeding sites, but remaining on their wintering grounds, 
or at least in southern parts of the normal summer dis-
tributional range (Ueta et al. 2002). Therefore, tracking
of adult or sub-adult Black-faced Spoonbills could pro-
vide more information about their migration schedules,

The key wintering sites (> 1% Criterion: 40 birds, n = 14) and important key sites (> 5% Criterion: 200 birds, shown in bold, n = 5) were identified based on the
maximum counts during 2004–2020 from the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society (HKBWS). Seven sites currently fall within existing protected area boundaries. In
addition, areas used in Deep Bay are partially protected and the Haifeng, Dongfang, Chiayi and Taipa-coloane sites are shown as provincial or state protected area, but
the areas used by birds were not within the current national protected area boundary
staging site use and the distribution range of this segment
of the population. This also suggests that the immature
birds do not usually undertake the long non-stop flight of
crossing the Yellow Sea to reach the Korean Peninsula for
summer. By doing so, young individuals could also avoid
competition with breeding birds (Kokko 1999).
We can synthesize information from tracking studies
to generate distribution map for the Black-faced Spoon-
bill’s stopover sites of autumn migration (Fig. 7), but data
were insufficient to do the same for spring migration. The
literature review found three important sites in spring
migration: Yancheng NNR in Jiangsu Province (three
birds);  Shanghai (four) and Yueqing in Zhejiang Prov-
ince (seven) (Ueta et al. 2002). This information is simi-
lar to the results from autumn migration, suggesting that
these three areas could be important stopover sites of the
Black-faced Spoonbills during both migration episodes. 
However, field surveys of these sites were still inadequate
to record the actual frequency of use by Black-faced
Spoonbills of these sites in spring (Fig. 6; Table 5). For
this reason, we urge systematic monitoring activities dur-
ing the migration period especially from mid-October
to mid-November and from mid-March to mid-April
at these sites, to generate information on abundance, 
turnover and stopover ecology of this species, as well as
the relative importance of the stopover sites.
On the breeding areas, field surveys were regularly
conducted in South Korea (Kwon et al. 2015; Kang et al. 
2016), China (Ding et al. 2000; Qiu 2007a, b; Jia et al. 
2020) and Russia (Tiunov and Katin 2020; Tiunov 2021),
but no survey or regular monitoring was conducted at
sites within North Korea. As the current wintering popu-
lation is more than 5200 individuals (Yu et al. 2021) and
non-systematic summer counts recorded less than 1000
individuals (Additional file 1: Table S1), this discrepancy
suggests that some breeding concentrations and aggrega-
tions of non-breeding immature individuals in summer
remained undiscovered. These sites could be of conserva-
tion importance for the Black-faced Spoonbill based on
the numbers of these missing individuals, so more field
surveys here are urgently needed.
Black-faced Spoonbills are sensitive to human dis-
turbance and benefit from protection of the sites (Wei
et al. 2005; Zhang et al. 2010, 2012; Henmi and Takano
2012; Sung et al. 2018). The Black-faced Spoonbill takes
five years to reach sexually maturity (Yu 2005), which
means the protection of the sites for these segments of
the population during staging and wintering period are

*Indicates that the date and/or duration were estimated. Stopover sites with more than ten birds (0.25% of the average wintering counts in 2016–2020) or used for
more than seven days are shown in bold
also important. However, many habitats used by Black-
faced Spoonbills are close to developed areas, including
major cities and harbors, and are experiencing severe
habitat loss and human disturbance, especially on their
wintering areas (Henmi and Takano 2012; Chen 2014; 
Choi et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2018). In addition, many of
the internationally important sites for the Black-faced
Spoonbill identified in this study currently lie outside of
the existing WDPA or NNRs protection areas. Although
some of sites could still be protected locally by provincial
or state governments, this status might not provide ade-
quate protection to the birds and their habitats against
national development plans (Zhang et al. 2015). There-
fore, we recommend that those sites qualifying as inter-
nationally important sites based on count data should be
given national protection. Pickett et al. (2018) also sug-
gested that the recent increase in population size was
due to recent low numbers falling well below potential 
population carrying capacities of their habitat, but cli-
mate change and on-going habitat loss are predicted to
have adverse impacts upon this species, causing ultimate
reductions in the size of their global population before
2050. Thus, we would argue that the future of the Black-
faced Spoonbill is not totally secure, despite the recent
increase in the global population.
To conclude, we urge continued field surveys and
tracking studies to provide further information about
the distribution and abundance of the Black-faced
Spoonbill particularly in summering period and
more tracking of adult individuals as the population
increases. We also recommend the strengthening of
protection and sympathetic management of wetlands
along the China coast, based on the important sites
identified in this study in Zhejiang and Fujian Prov-
ince, as well as in the traditional wintering areas in
Guangdong and Hainan Provinces. After identifying

number of birds using the 26 sites during autumn migration. Numbers in brackets after site names indicate the number of different tagged birds
recorded using that staging site. Among the sites, 10 sites were used for 1 day (black dots), 9 sites were used for 2–7 days (small white circles), and
7 sites were used for 8–31 days (large white circles). Sites used for at least 2 days were marked with their names on the map. Three sites were used
more than once: Yancheng NNR in Jiangsu Province, 3 times; Shanghai (including Chongming Island), 9 times; Luoyuan Bay in Fujian Province, twice, 
all in China. Revised stopover range is shaded in light purple
key stopover sites along the southwest coast of Korea
and east coast of China, regular monitoring activities
should be established there to track the abundance and
turnover rate of Black-faced Spoonbills during passage. 
Following this study, we also suggest the creation of an
open platform to deposit count and census data, track-
ing studies results and regularly updated information on
the distribution range and abundance of the Black-faced
Spoonbill. This platform will be useful for the long-term 
scientific research, conservation planning and rais-
ing awareness of this iconic waterbird in East Asia. 
Through this participation process, we hope to engage
more researchers and conservationists locally and glob-
ally joining hands to protect this species and their wet-
land habitats, which could also be beneficial for other
waterbirds.
