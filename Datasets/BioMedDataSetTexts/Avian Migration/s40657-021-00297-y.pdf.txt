Abstract 
Background:  The vulnerable Chinese Egret (Egretta eulophotes) is a long-distance migratory waterbird whose migra-
tion and wintering information is poorly understood. This study aims to identify the autumn migration routes and
wintering areas of juvenile Chinese Egrets and determine the migration movement traits of this species.
Methods:  Thirty-nine juvenile Chinese Egrets from the Fantuozi Island, an uninhabited offshore island with a large
breeding colony of Chinese Egrets in Dalian, China, were tracked using GPS/GSM transmitters. Some feathers from
each tracked juvenile were collected for molecular identification of sex in the laboratory. The GPS locations, recorded
at 2-h intervals from August 2018 to May 2020, were used for the analyses.
Results:  Of the 39 tracked juveniles, 30 individuals began their migration between September and November, 
and 13 successfully completed their autumn migration between October and November. The juveniles migrated
southward via three migration routes, coastal, oceanic and inland, mainly during the night. The migration duration, 
migration distance, flight speed, and stopover duration of the 13 juvenile egrets that completed migration averaged
5.08 ± 1.04 days, 3928.18 ± 414.27 km, 57.27 ± 5.73 km/h, and 23.08 ± 19.28 h, respectively. These juveniles wintered
in the coastal wetlands of Southeast Asia including those in the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia, and only one suc-
cessfully began its spring migration in June 2020.
Conclusions:  This study newly finds that the oceanic route taken by juvenile Chinese Egrets, suggesting that the
juveniles are able to fly over the Pacific Ocean without a stopover. Moreover, our novel data indicate that coastal
wetlands along the East Asian–Australasian Flyway are important areas for both autumn migration stopover and the
wintering of these juveniles, suggesting that international cooperation is important to conserve the vulnerable Chi-
nese Egret and the wetland habitats on which it depends.

Background
Seasonal climatic changes and food availability fluctua-
tions drive many species of animals to migrate between
breeding and wintering areas (Alerstam et al. 2003;

niles, their long-distance migration is incredibly chal-
lenging (Klaassen et al. 2014; Oppel et al. 2015; Rotics
et al. 2016; Vega et al. 2016) regardless of whether they
travel by themselves (McKinnon et al. 2014) or follow
adults (Sergio et al. 2014; Hewson et al. 2016; Meyburg
et al. 2017).  Juveniles may have migration strategies
that differ from those of adults (Strandberg et al. 2010; 
McKinnon et al. 2014), such as choosing different move-
ment patterns (Oppel et al. 2015), spending more time

at stopover sites (Mellone et al. 2013), flying with large
flocks to escape predators, or exploring new migration
paths to accommodate environmental change (Yoda et al. 
2017).  Although the juvenile migration and wintering
destination of several ardeid species have been examined
(Jourdain et al. 2008; Geary et al. 2015), further conserva-
tion studies addressing the juvenile migration ecology of
other species, especially those that are either threatened
or depend on particular areas, are still needed (Rotics
et al. 2016; Vega et al. 2016).
The Chinese Egret (Egretta eulophotes)  (Pelecani-
formes: Ardeidae) is a globally vulnerable species with
an estimated population below 10,000 worldwide (Bird-
Life International 2020). It is a wetland-dependent bird, 
usually foraging in coastal wetlands, mainly breeding on
offshore islands in eastern China, North Korea, South
Korea and eastern Russia, and wintering in coastal
regions of southeast Asia, with sightings of banded bird
occurring in the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sin-
gapore, Brunei, Vietnam and Thailand. This egret is a
long-distance migrant, likely migrating through coastal
South Korea, Japan and China. According to the IUCN, 
the Chinese Egret has suffered population reductions in
recent decades because of the reclamation of tidal mud-
flats, estuarine habitats, and offshore breeding islands for
agriculture and industry (BirdLife International 2020).
Although many studies have focused on the breeding
behavior, feeding ecology and genetics of the Chinese
Egret (Zhou et al. 2010; Huang et al. 2013; Wang et al. 
2013; Dai et al. 2015; Lei et al. 2016), and juvenile Chi-
nese Egret migration data were collected from within
China from 5 transmitters (Zhang et al. 2018), the trans-
national migration and wintering areas of this vulnerable
species have not been studied.
In this study, we documented the transnational migra-
tion and wintering areas of juvenile Chinese Egrets and
aimed to: (1) identify and map juvenile Chinese Egret
autumn migration routes with Global Positioning System
(GPS) tracking, (2) determine their migration movement
traits such as travel distance, migration duration, stopo-
ver duration and flight speed, and (3) identify their win-
tering areas. Our novel juvenile Chinese Egret migration
data will provide a fundamental basis for further studies
on the population dynamics and habitat conservation of
this vulnerable species.
Methods
Study area
Juvenile Chinese Egrets were captured on Fantuozi Island
(39°9′12.16″ N, 122°18′  19.84″ E) in Dalian, Liaoning
Province, China (Fig. 1). This offshore island is located in
the Yellow Sea and near Bohai Bay, and its distance from
the mainland is approximately 11.9 km. Fantuozi Island 
has hosted a large breeding colony of vulnerable Chinese
Egrets during April to October in recent years. The area
of this breeding island is approximately 0.09 k­ m2 and the
island is uninhabited.
Capture of birds and transmitter attachment
In August 2018, 39 fully flighted juvenile Chinese Egrets
were captured on the ground near their nests at night
using a hand-held net after they fledged, their weights
and body length were measured, and some feathers were
collected to extract DNA to unambiguously assign sex
later in the laboratory (Huang et al. 2013). Then, the juve-
niles were fitted with solar-charged GPS/GSM transmit-
ters (HQB-2512S, weight 14 g, or HQB-2009P, weight
9 g; Hunan Global Messenger Technology, China). The
weight of the transmitter plus backpacks with a Teflon
ribbon harness was approximately 2–4% of the average
egret’s weight (449.10 ± 43.21 g) (Hadjikyriakou et al. 
2020). Both types of transmitters included a solar panel
with rechargeable batteries, transmitting data at 2-h
intervals via the GSM network. All birds were released
within 2 h at the site of capture when no abnormal behav-
ior or death was observed after transmitter attachment.
Migration parameters
Departure was considered to have occurred when new
locations showed a significant southern movement and
directional movements continued to occur (Huschle et al. 
2013). The wintering area was based on the IUCN docu-
ment or determined by both movements not continuing
to move south and juveniles surviving through whole
wintering period in the reached area during December–
February to ensure that the data represent the locations
of wintering birds. When a juvenile arrived at a wintering
area, its autumn migration was considered complete. The
autumn migration of juvenile Chinese Egrets was defined
as the last point recorded from the vicinity of its natal
island before departure until the first point reached in
the wintering area, and using the WGS-84 (World Geo-
detic System 1984, used by all GPS devices) coordinate
system, the migration distance was calculated by sum-
ming all the distances of consecutive migration locations
between these two points, not including the variation in
locations at stopover sites (Li et al. 2020). A stopover site
was defined as an area when the speed was 0 km/h and
where a juvenile stayed for at least 4 h (two GPS posi-
tions and intervals recorded with a transmitter) dur-
ing the migration journey (Mi et al. 2018; Alonso et al. 
2020). The inland and coastal migration routes indicated
that more than two thirds of the juvenile stopover sites
occurred in freshwater and coastal wetlands, respectively. 
Migration duration was defined as the total duration
between the last date in the vicinity of the natal island

males
before departure and the first date on which successfully
arriving individuals reached the wintering area, includ-
ing the periods spent at stopover sites (Huschle et al. 
2013). Migration speed was calculated as the migration
distance divided by the migration duration (Monti et al. 
2018; Li et al. 2020). Night and day were defined as 6:00
p.m. to 6:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Beijing time, 
respectively, depending on the transmitter’s transmission
at 2-h intervals via the GSM network and according to
the closer local times of sunrise and sunset ([URL: "https://richurimo.51240.com/or"] https://​richu​
 rimo.​51240.​com/​or [URL: "http://www.timeanddate.com"] www.​timea​nddate.​com) in Octo-
ber in two time zones, UTC + 8 (China, Philippines, and
Malaysia) and UTC + 7 (Vietnam), in which the juvenile
Chinese Egrets passed during their autumn migration.
The death of a tracked juvenile was identified on the
basis of three indicators (Monti et al. 2018; Sergio et al. 
2019): the transmission data indicated that the transmit-
ter was functioning normally, GPS locations confirmed
that the transmitter was stationary or the juvenile was
not moving, and terminal temperature values followed 
the environmental temperature fluctuations. However, 
this indirect death identification sometimes cannot be
distinguished from transmitter loss and hence might
overestimate the mortality of juveniles. Therefore, the
retrieval of carcasses or transmitters in the field was
used to further confirm death and determine the cause
of death if possible. Transmitter-failure (signal loss) was
assumed to occur when the GPS signal was suddenly
interrupted and no new GPS data were further received. 
This transmitter-failure identification procedure some-
times included death that occurred over the sea, as no
carcass or transmitter could be found, and hence might
underestimate mortality.
Data analyses
GPS positions were utilized to map the migration routes
of the juvenile Chinese Egrets, visualize their move-
ments with Google Earth remote-sensing images (Google
Inc. 2013), and identify their wintering areas (Klaassen
et al. 2010; Page et al. 2014; Hadjikyriakou et al. 2020)

via ArcGIS 10.3. A-test was used to analyze gender dif-
ferences and all statistical analyses were conducted in R
3.5.1 (R Core Team 2018).

Tracking results
Thirty-nine juvenile Chinese Egrets were captured and
tracked in the summer of 2018, including 15 females and
24 males. During their first autumn journey, migration
information was obtained for 30 tracked juveniles (14
females, 16 males), and 9 tracked juveniles (1 female, 8
males) died before starting migration (Table 1). Finally, 
13 tracked juveniles (8 females and 5 males) successfully
finished migration and arrived in the wintering area, 13
tracked juveniles unfortunately failed, and 4 lost signals
during migration. 
Migration routes
The juvenile Chinese Egrets departed southward from
the vicinity of their natal island and underwent direc-
tional movements that continued to occur in a narrow
range, with longitude ranging between 128.39° E and
105.76° E and latitude ranging from 40.55° N to 4.71° 
N. GPS tracking data showed that the juvenile Chinese
Egrets migrated via three routes: coastal, inland, and oce-
anic (Fig. 1).
The coastal route was most often used by the juve-
nile Chinese Egrets. Twenty-one of the tracked egrets
(11 females, 10 males) migrated along this route, with
11 individuals successfully arriving in the wintering
area. The juveniles flew along the eastern coast of Chi-
nese mainland, passed across the Taiwan Strait and
South China Sea, and finally arrived in their wintering
area. On this journey, there were several stopovers in the

coastal wetlands of China, including those in Shandong, 
Jiangsu, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Taiwan, Guangdong, 
Guangxi, and Hainan.
The inland route of juvenile Chinese Egrets was via
Chinese mainland to the wintering area. On this jour-
ney, their stopovers were mainly distributed in the fresh-
water wetlands of Chinese mainland, including those in
Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi. Six juveniles (one
female, five males) migrated via this route (Fig. 1). Two
flew inland but stayed in Guangxi, China, which is not a
reported wintering area for the Chinese Egret, and died
or lost data there in late winter. The other four juveniles
died during inland migration, with one staying near the
Poyang Lake in Jiangxi Province, China, for 51 days.
The oceanic route of juvenile Chinese Egrets was a
migration route in which juveniles flew over the Pacific
Ocean to the wintering area. Three juveniles (two
females, one male) migrated via this route, with two
females directly arriving in the wintering area without
a stopover. These two females flew over 3305.44 km in
56 h and 3368.40 km in 62 h across the Pacific Ocean. 
The male migrating via the oceanic route flew along the
Korean Peninsula and Japan, and passed over the western
Pacific Ocean but unfortunately died at a stopover site in
Taiwan.
Migration movements
The juvenile Chinese Egrets began their migration jour-
neys between September 23rd and November 16th, with
a departure peak occurring October 16th to 17th among
eight males. Unlike males, females mostly embarked on
different dates and most of them (N = 11, approximately
73%) left before October 16th (Table 1). These juveniles
arrived in wintering areas between October 3rd and
November 1st.
Juvenile Chinese Egrets mainly migrated during the
night. The total flight time for all juveniles (N = 30) 
was 622 h (79.85%) during the night from 6:00 p.m. 
to 6:00 a.m. and 157 h (20.15%) during the day. The
complete migration duration of 13 juveniles averaged
5.08 ± 1.04 days, with the shortest time being approxi-
mately 3 days without stopover, and the longest duration
was 7 days with 4 stopovers. There was no significant
difference in migration duration between males (N = 5, 
5.40 ± 0.55 days) and females (N = 8, 4.88 ± 1.25 days) 
(p > 0.05). The stopover duration of these 13 juveniles
averaged 23.08 ± 19.28 h during the complete migra-
tion, ranging from 6 to 66 h. The flight speed during
the complete migration averaged 57.27 ± 5.73 km/h, 
and the maximum speed reached 116.8 km/h. The
migratory distance of these juvenile egrets during the
complete migration averaged 3928.18 ± 414.27 km, 
ranging from 3305.44 to 4562.74 km. There was

no significant difference in migration distance
between males (4071.30 ± 345.35 km) and females
(3838.72 ± 449.75 km) (p > 0.05).
Wintering areas
Our data map (Fig. 2) showed that five (three females, 
two males) juvenile Chinese Egrets arrived and win-
tered in the Philippines, four (two females, two males) 
arrived and wintered in Vietnam, and three (two
females, one male) arrived and wintered in Malaysia. 
Two juveniles (one female, one male) stayed in Guangxi
in China and died or lost data there in late winter, sug-
gesting that Guangxi might be a newly recorded winter-
ing area of the Chinese Egret. This observation needs
to be further confirmed with more evidence, such as
adult wintering records or juvenile survival through
the whole wintering period. The wintering area covered
4.9127° N to 18.75929° N latitude and 105.76315° E to
122.28246° E longitude (Table 2). Of these juveniles, 12
individuals died while staying in their wintering areas, 
one (JE1815) lost its signal in January 2019, and only
one successfully started its spring migration on June
2020 after staying in the Philippines for 606 days.

Discussion
This GPS tracking study showed that the autumn migra-
tion of juvenile Chinese Egrets migrated southward via
three routes: coastal, oceanic, and inland. The oceanic
route was the first to be reported for this egret, and the
coastal and inland routes were consistent with previ-
ous findings of studies tracking juvenile Chinese Egrets
in China (Zhang et al. 2018). The oceanic route had a
shorter migration distance (3336.92 km on average) 
and migration duration (59.00 h) than the coastal route
(4035.68 km and 70.55 h, respectively).  The coastal
migration route was the most important for juvenile Chi-
nese Egrets, as it was popular for autumn migration, sug-
gesting that coastal wetlands are critical habitats for the
conservation of the vulnerable Chinese Egret. The inland
route, such as that used by one individual that stayed for
51 days in Poyang Lake in Chinese mainland, suggests
that juvenile egrets might consume prey in freshwater
habitats during the autumn migration. Previous nestling
diet analyses on offshore breeding islands in southern
China indicated that the nestlings depended on prey that
only occurred in coastal wetlands (Fang et al. 2011).
Our tracking data indicated that juvenile Chinese
Egrets departed southward in autumn from the vicinity
of their natal island to their wintering areas, the Philip-
pines, Vietnam, and Malaysia, after a premigratory stage
in early summer. This migration information is highly
consistent with the typical pattern of autumn migration
in other juvenile ardeid birds, such as Reddish Egrets
(Egretta rufescens) (Geary et al. 2015) and Purple Herons
(Ardea purpurea) (Jourdain et al. 2008). However, there
are some differences in the movement traits of ardeid
species. The average migratory distance of juvenile Chi-
nese Egrets (3928.18 ± 414.27 km) was longer than that 
of juvenile Reddish Egrets (1140.41 ± 179.16 km) (Geary
et al. 2015), and the average flight speed of juvenile Chi-
nese Egrets (57.27 ± 5.73 km/h) was faster than that of
juvenile Purple Herons (approximately 40 km/h) and
juvenile Reddish Egrets (4.87 km/day) (Jourdain et al. 
2008; Geary et al. 2015).  Analyzing consistency and
plasticity in migratory traits between short- and long-
distance migrants within the same species is essential
to understand the evolution and ontogeny of migratory
strategies (Monti et al. 2018). The oceanic route of juve-
nile Chinese Egrets had a shorter migration distance
(3336.92 km on average), fewer stopover (0), and slower
flight speed (54.71 km/h) when compared to those of the
coastal route (4035.68 km; 1.5; and 57.73 km/h, respec-
tively). A study on short- and long-distance migratory
Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) showed that short-distance
migration birds had shorter migratory distances, lower
stopover use, and a faster flight speed when compared
to long-distance migratory birds, suggesting that migra-
tion distance affects stopover use but not flight speed
and that the lower flight speed is due to higher stopover
use (Monti et al. 2018). Our data support the conclusion
that migration distance affects stopover use when juve-
nile Chinese Egrets use a relatively direct oceanic route
across the Pacific Ocean without stopovers but do not
correspond with the suggestion that higher stopover use
reduces flight speed.
The mortalities of tracked juvenile Chinese Egrets
were 23.08, 38.46, and 23.08% in the stages of premigra-
tion, migration and wintering, respectively. The associ-
ated high mortality indicates that autumn migration is a
more critical time affecting the survival of juvenile Chi-
nese Egrets than both the premigration and wintering
periods. The first autumn migration is a crucial time for
Page 7

juveniles because of the combination of their relatively
low mobility and inexperience. Juveniles may experi-
ence high costs associated with their relatively low flight
performance because of their inexperience when using
thermals (on land) or choosing favorable air currents
(Mitchell et al. 2015). They may spend more time at stop-
over sites to refuel than older individuals due to their low
foraging efficiency (Riotte-Lambert and Weimerskirch
2013). Moreover, juveniles may be more likely to interact
naively with predators or venture into suboptimal habi-
tats, decreasing their probability of obtaining adequate
refuel and/or survival (Geary et al. 2015). In addition, 
during migration, the mortalities of our tracked juveniles
along the coastal, oceanic, and inland route were 33.33, 
33.33, and 83.33%, respectively. The juveniles successfully
finished migration had significantly lower stopover use
(N = 13; 1.38 ± 1.04) than the unsuccessful individuals
(N = 14; 3.86 ± 2.60) (p < 0.01), suggesting that low stopo-
ver use may reduce mortality during autumn migration. 
When migrants increase their use of stopovers during
the migratory period, they may experience a longer time
over which to encounter harsh environmental conditions, 
leading to death.
Our data support that the Chinese Egret is one of the
key species making use of the East Asian–Australasian
Flyway (EAAFP 2020).  The migratory routes taken by
juvenile Chinese Egrets stretch from China, southward
through East Asia to wintering areas in Southeast Asia
including the Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam, which
could be identified as a part of the East Asian–Australa-
sian Flyway (EAAFP 2020). During the migration jour-
ney, Chinese Egrets should rely on a system of healthy
wetlands to rest and feed. The habitats along the flyway, 
ranging from important inland wetlands to coastal and
offshore sites, are internationally important in supporting
the vulnerable Chinese Egret. Among the three migratory
routes used by juvenile Chinese Egrets, the coastal route
was most often used, suggesting that coastal wetlands are
particularly important for these birds. In the future, it is
essential to identify and conserve a network of impor-
tant wetlands used by the Chinese Egret throughout its
migratory routes.
Conclusions
Juvenile Chinese Egrets were found to migrate southward
via three migration routes, coastal, oceanic, and inland, 
winter in the coastal wetlands of Southeast Asia, includ-
ing the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia, and begin
their spring migration in the third year, which confirms
that the Chinese Egret is one of the key species using the
East Asian–Australasian Flyway. Among these routes, the
oceanic route is newly reported in this study. Moreover, 
the coastal route is most often used by juveniles during 
autumn migration, suggesting that coastal wetlands are
particularly important. The inland route used by some
juveniles indicates that they may rely on freshwater wet-
land habitats. Our novel autumn migration data collected
for the Chinese Egret suggest that international coop-
eration is important to conserve this vulnerable egret
and the wetland habitats on which it depends. These
results provide a fundamental basis for further studies to
develop conservation plans for this vulnerable species.
