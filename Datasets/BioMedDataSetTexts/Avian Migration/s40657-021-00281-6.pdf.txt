migratory divide

Abstract 
Background:  Long-term ringing and telemetry studies show that the Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) is a broad-front
migrant following different migratory flyways, depending on the geographical location of their breeding populations. 
We have investigated two distinct and declining populations of Osprey in Poland, separated by only a few hundred
kilometres, and hypothesised they may exhibit two different migration routes. We followed mortality causes, compar-
ing them between migration and stationary phases of annual cycle, as well as between two distinct populations.
Methods:  Nineteen Ospreys, both juveniles and adults, were equipped with GPS loggers in 2017–2020 in two
populations in western and eastern Poland and followed on their autumn migration. We calculated the distance they
covered on the migration, number of stopover days, migration duration, daily distances covered and departure dates
to compare them between age and sex classes and between the eastern and western populations.
Results:  Ospreys from the western and eastern populations showed a partial migratory divide. While the first
migrated through a western flyway, the second followed a central flyway, resulting in crossing the Mediterranean Sea
in distant passes that affected the distance covered. Annual mortality reached at least 67% in juveniles and at least
57% in adults.
Conclusions:  We showed that two distinct Osprey populations in Poland revealed a partial migratory divide, with
one covering greater distances over sea and deserts over the central flyway. This might affect individual survival rates
and contribute to a steeper decline in one of the populations. In order for this to be confirmed, more individuals still
have to be followed.

Background
Revealing bird migration patterns is crucial to under-
standing the factors limiting populations of long-dis-
tance migratory species. Migrations are considered the
most dangerous part of the annual cycle and mortality
at that time may exceed that of the breeding and win-
tering periods even six-fold (Klaassen et al. 2014). The

differentiation of migration routes between populations
is known to affect individuals’ survival and, effectu-
ally, also whole population trends (Hewson et al. 2016).
Therefore, it is justified to investigate migratory behav-
iour of selected, especially declining, populations of
species, although they already seem sufficiently studied. 
One such extensively studied species is the Osprey (Pan-
dion haliaetus; see Bierregaard et al. 2014 for summary
of migration studies). It is a true cosmopolitan species, 
considered a long-distance migrant in most of the North-
ern Hemisphere (Martell et al. 2011; MacKrill 2017), but
also a sedentary or partial-migratory species in lower

latitudes (Monti et al. 2018a). A great body of studies
have shown that Ospreys can migrate in broad-front. A
study by Østnes et al. (2019) can serve as a good example
of such a flexible migration pattern, where juveniles dis-
persed in different directions and crossed the Mediter-
ranean Sea at known bottlenecks but also through open
sea. On the other hand, depending on the geographi-
cal location of populations, Ospreys tend to show some
general “highways” and minor paths (Fig. 1). Individuals
from western Europe (United Kingdom, Germany, Nor-
way and Sweden) were shown to most frequently use (but
not exclusively) the western-most Mediterranean pas-
sage through the Iberian Peninsula (Alerstam et al. 2006; 
Klaassen et al. 2011; Mackrill 2017; Meyburg et al. 2018). 
This seems logical and, consequently, the Ospreys from
eastern Europe (Russia, Baltic countries and some from
Finland) passed the Mediterranean Sea along its east-
ern shore or the Balkan Peninsula (Väli and Sellis 2015; 
Babushkin et al. 2019; LUOMUS 2020). The central Med-
iterranean passage through Corsica and Italian Peninsula
were used by the Ospreys from central (e.g. Germany) 
and both, eastern and western Europe, but to a lesser
degree. Finally, crossing the sea at its full width without
any insurance of peninsulas and islands is also a com-
mon phenomenon in the case of this species. However, 
taking into account that migratory behaviour of soaring
raptors, such as the Osprey, is most likely governed by
innate mechanism (Väli et al. 2018), resembling the one

called “clock and compass” known from passerines (Hel-
big 1996), we can expect that migration direction differs
between populations. This assumption is supported by
the philopatry phenomenon known to occur in Ospreys
(Monti et al. 2018b). In this context, it might be inter-
esting to investigate migration routes of populations in
the middle of the range to check if the migration direc-
tion exhibits a continuous range or a migratory divide
between the eastern and western populations of the
species.
The central part of the Osprey’s European range shows
a break that is further prolonged by the Baltic Sea (Fig. 1).
In the eastern part, species range is continuous, while in
the western part, the range is fragmented but the popu-
lation is increasing thanks to conservation efforts (Den-
nis 2016). However, between the continuous eastern and
growing German population, there are small “islands” in
this species’ range, located in Poland. Both are in decline. 
Therefore, conservation actions and studies were recently
carried out in order to protect this species in its last Pol-
ish populations (Anderwald 2017). We have carried out a
GPS telemetry study to follow spatial ecology and mor-
tality rates, but also to reveal if those two populations will
show contrasting migratory patterns that might affect
the more isolated and faster declining eastern population
in particular. Taking into account the migration studies
conducted so far (Fig. 1), we predict that the eastern and
western populations may show a migratory divide and, 
therefore, might also be subjected to different selective
pressure. Thus, our aim was to check whether migration
paths and migration patterns differ between the eastern
and western populations as well as between different age
and sex classes. Also, we followed mortality rates and
reasons to reveal the crucial threats for those declining
populations and to check if potentially different migra-
tory behaviour might affect it.
Methods
Study area and bird tagging
The study was carried out in two small, spatially dis-
tinct Polish populations, separated by about 235 km
(between closest nests).  The eastern population forms
a small island (only 8–9 pairs in 2020) in the species
range, about 200 km from the nearest breeding sites in
Lithuania. It is located in the vast Masuria Lakeland area, 
where Ospreys mostly nest in the interior of large forest
complexes. The western population contains about 16
pairs (in 2020) scattered in forests, but some also nest-
ing on electric pylons on farmland. This population is
slowly increasing and some exchange of individuals with
Ospreys from eastern Germany was observed to occur in
both directions. 
Tagging was carried out in 2017–2020 and covered
both chicks in nests and adults. In the first year, only a
single juvenile was equipped with a 30 g “Ornitrack E30” 
GPS GPRS logger (manufactured by Ornitela Lithuania),
while later on 4 individuals were tagged annually in 2018
and 2020 and 10 individuals in 2019, all with 35–40 g
“Kite-M” GPS GPRS loggers (manufactured by Ecotone
Poland).  Well-developed chicks (body mass > 1420 g) 
were caught in the nests. Adults were caught with large
mist nets, provoked by a stuffed white-tailed eagle close
to their nests. Devices were mounted on the birds’ backs
with Teflon ribbon sewn at the sternum with the “Y” 
method described by Buehler et al. (1995).  Data were
acquired with a 15-min interval, on average. Sex was
identified according to body mass and biometrics (Poole
1982), although in the case of juveniles, they were treated
as possible male and possible female as biometry meas-
urements can sometimes overlap between sexes. In the
case of adults, direct observations of behaviour at the
nesting site and the extent of the breeding patch were
found to be reliable criteria in identifying sex.
Analysis
The onset of autumn migration was determined as a
long (over 30 km), directional (straight-line) movement
in the southern or south-western direction undertaken
over at least two consecutive days. A threshold of a
daily distance of 30 km was chosen upon a histogram
of daily distance covered during the expected time of
migration (August–November). Distance up to 30 km
formed a visibly more frequent class, while distances
over 30 km were represented with a similar frequency
range (Additional file 1: Fig. S1). A stopover site was
defined as an area where a bird spent more than two
consecutive nights in a radius of less than 10 km. The
end of autumn migration and beginning of wintering
was considered to be the last day of the long, direc-
tional movement southwards. Migration direction was
measured (in QGIS) as azimuth between location at
start of migration and reaching the Mediterranean Sea. 
At the sea-crossing point, the innate migratory direc-
tion might already be distorted by choosing the most
convenient site and trying to bypass this barrier, and
therefore we measured it at the early migration stage. 
For mortality statistics, we counted followed individual
as perished, if we were able to find its dead corpse. We
reported also suspicious losses of data transmission
as possible mortality events, but we have not included
those cases as mortality events, since tag malfunction is
also a common scenario. Total and daily distance cov-
ered by the followed individuals were calculated using
the moveHMM package (Michelot et al. 2016) in R 4.0.3
and two-point equidistant projection. Straight-line

distance was calculated with the same projection in
QGIS 3.16. In order to check if sex, age and popula-
tion had any impact on movement speed, they were
used as fixed factors in linear mixed effects models with
random effect of individual built into the lme4 pack-
age (Bates et al. 2015) to explain the logarithm of daily
distance covered during migration. Stopover days were
excluded by limiting the dataset to days with move-
ment over 50 km. Models were built in additive pat-
tern. The best supported model was chosen according
to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).  Models
with ΔAIC < 2 were averaged in the MuMIn package
(Bartoń 2020).  In order to check whether migration
patterns differed between individuals from the two dis-
tinct populations or individuals of different sex and age, 
departure date, migration duration, migration direc-
tion, number of stopover days and distance covered on
migration were compared in above-mentioned pairs
using the Mann–Whitney test.
Results
Migration routes
Out of 19 Ospreys tagged with GPS tags, we recorded
the autumn migration of 12:5 adults (1 for 2 sea-
sons) and 7 juveniles (Table 1). The remaining 7 died
before the onset of migration, juveniles mostly due
to Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) predation or fell due
to unknown reasons still at the nest or in its vicinity. 
Two adult males died due to poaching and electro-
cution at the breeding grounds. Unfortunately, 3 of
migrating individuals recorded incomplete tracks, but
came far enough to judge their general migration paths
(Fig. 2a).  The Ospreys showed broad-front migration
and crossed the Mediterranean Sea in a vast belt from
Gibraltar to the Balkan Peninsula to winter in the cen-
tral part of Western Africa (Fig. 2a). The only exception
was the juvenile that wintered in the Iberian Penin-
sula (Table 1). Some juveniles travelled long distances
over open sea, while adults tended to use less hazard-
ous paths along the eastern shore of the Iberian Pen-
insula, Corsica and Italian Peninsula (Fig. 2b). Ospreys
from the eastern and western populations in Poland
exhibited a partial migratory divide, with most of the
individuals (86%;  incl. all juveniles) from the east-
ern population heading south (azimuth 205.5 ± 16.8) 
and crossing the Mediterranean Sea at the middle to
reach wintering sites in Ghana, Burkina Faso, Nige-
ria, Angola. On the contrary, most of the individuals
(83%) from the western population headed south-west
(azimuth 221.0 ± 20.3) to cross the Mediterranean Sea
at its western narrowing and winter in Senegal, Sierra
Leone and Spain (Fig. 2c). Differences in azimuth were, 
however, not significant (U = 12, p = 0.23).  At later
stages, migration direction was similar between the
eastern and western population. 
Mortality
We observed high mortality in juveniles in their first year, 
reaching 67% in the case of certain deaths, but possibly
even 83% together if unknown cases of suspicious signal
losses were added. Some cases even occurred before the
onset of migration (Table 2). Five died at fledgling stage: 
one in the nest of unknown reasons, three were killed by
a Goshawk and another one was killed by a wind turbine. 
Two juveniles died at wintering sites: one was poached
in Nigeria, the other died of unknown reasons in Sen-
egal. The last death was confirmed at the start of spring
migration in Spain, probably due to Goshawk preda-
tion. Another two juveniles stopped transmitting during
autumn migration: one in Italy, the other in Morocco, but
we have no evidence of their death. Only two juveniles
certainly survived the first year and transmitted in the
next season.
Surprisingly, the mortality of adults was also high
and reached 57% (confirmed deaths) already in the first
year of tracking. In this case, the reasons were highly
anthropogenic in three (out of four) cases: two adults
died because of electrocution (one in Senegal and one in
Poland) and one was poached (still in Poland). Another
individual (from the eastern population) was simply
found dead (for unknown reasons) in Burkina Faso. Two
other adults from eastern population stopped transmit-
ting in the deserts and were not seen at their breeding
grounds in the next year, therefore actual mortality was
probably even higher.
Factors affecting autumn migration
Models explaining daily distance covered on migration
were poorly distinguishable between the base model with
a random effect of individual only, comparing to mod-
els involving individual’s sex, age and source population
(Table 3). Eventually, the averaged model involved all the
factors, but all were insignificant and showed very low
slope estimates (Table 4). The variance explained by the
base model was low (conditional R2 = 0.151) and barely
increased when other predictors were added (conditional
R2 increased to 0.165–0.167, depending on the model).
The departure for autumn migration did not differ
significantly between individuals of different age or sex, 
although in the last case, surprisingly, females left breed-
ing grounds later than males (Additional file 1: Fig. S2).
Similarly, we found no effect of age or sex on migra-
tion distance, duration and number of stopover days
(Fig. 3a, c, d; Additional file 1: Table S1). However, when

individuals from different source populations were com-

significantly higher in the eastern than in the western
population (Fig. 3b) although straight-line distance was
almost the same (U = 15, p = 0.286).  When migration
was divided into sections, juveniles covered some surplus
kilometres across land in Europe, compared to adults
(Fig. 4a). Individuals from the eastern population covered
shorter distances over land in Europe, but longer over

sea and the Sahara Desert (Fig. 4b). Unfortunately, the
sample size was too small to perform reliable statistical
comparisons. 
In general, the dynamics of migration was rather
even in adults, but showed longer stopovers and more
pronounced stopover behaviour in some juveniles
(Additional file 1: Fig. S3).  Individuals of both age 
groups were capable of covering a distance of around
800 km in 24 h.
Discussion
Overall, the Ospreys from the two distinct populations
differed in their migration routes. With single excep-
tions, individuals from the eastern and western popu-
lations headed south and south-west, respectively. 
Eastern juveniles, which are supposed to follow their
innate migratory mechanism at first migration (Väli
et al. 2018), tended to cross the Mediterranean Sea fur-
ther east than adults, highlighting the difference in direc-
tion between eastern and western population. Taking
into account that migratory direction is inherited, single
exceptions from the main flyways may show that the two
populations are not entirely isolated. Osprey males are
highly philopatric and breed in the radius of about 30 km
from their natal sites (Kinkead 1985). On the contrary, 
females can show quite long dispersal and may breed
hundreds of kilometres from their birth site. In the men-
tioned population of the Osprey in eastern Poland, alien
females (but not males), ringed in Germany and Latvia
(> 500 km), were recorded to breed. Thus, gene flow with

differences

populations of different migration paths certainly occurs, 
although with low frequency, as shown for other Euro-
pean populations by Monti et al. (2018b). The authors
of the above-mentioned paper reveal that gene flow and
migratory behaviour are linked in Europe and the central
location of Polish populations might attract dispersing
females from three different migratory pathways. How-
ever, looking at the rather distinct migratory pathways
of Ospreys belonging to the western and central popula-
tions studied, gene flow rates are rather low. Preliminary
genetic analysis done on Polish Ospreys showed relatively
high heterozygosity in the small sample set dominated by
the western population. All individuals from this popula-
tion represented one haplotype (Rutkowski 2019), com-
mon for Ospreys in northern and western Europe (Monti
et al. 2018b).  On the other hand, unique alleles were
found in a single individual examined from the eastern
population (Rutkowski 2019). This fact may indicate rela-
tively high genetic distance between the two mentioned
populations, but needs further confirmation in a greater
sample size. 
Migration patterns, at least for tested traits, did not
differ between age and sex classes. This was quite sur-
prising, since many studies have shown females depart
much earlier than males (Bai and Schmidt 2012; Väli
and Sellis 2015; Meyburg et al. 2018), adult females and
juveniles cover longer distances than adult males (Bai
and Schmidt 2012), and males use fewer days for stopo-
vers than females (Alerstam et al. 2006; Meyburg et al. 
2018).  In terms of the departure date, the difference
should be sharp, but not only was this not observed in
adult females, but we found them departing later than
adult males. This might be an artefact caused by the low
sample size, but also it may indicate that foraging condi-
tions were optimal and inter-species competition is low
in those small populations. Therefore, instead of moving
to other foraging sites, the breeding grounds were suit-
able for “filling their tanks” before migration. In contrary
to other mentioned studies, we did not find age or sex to
affect migration dynamics, but also showed that it is vari-
able, especially in the case of juveniles (Additional file 1: 
Fig. S3).
Individuals from different source populations, although
located along similar latitudes, exhibited close-to-sig-
nificant differences in migration distance (Fig. 3b), with
individuals from the eastern population covering, on
average, over 2000 km more to reach wintering sites. 
When migration was divided into stages, we found that
the main difference in migration length lies in the most
risky parts: crossing the Mediterranean Sea and Sahara
Desert (Fig. 4b). This fact may be a factor in differing sur-
vival rates and the opposite population trend patterns in
the two populations across the migratory divide. Such a
pattern was shown for the Common Cuckoo (Cuculus
canorus) in Great Britain, which uses two different paths
on its way to wintering sites in Africa (Hewson et al. 
2016).  Those that followed the central Mediterranean
passage and later headed through the central part of the
Sahara Desert exhibited higher mortality and, in conse-
quence, declined.
We found mortality rates in Polish Ospreys to be
high in juveniles, which was expected, but also high
in adults. It seems odd that mature and experienced
Ospreys in our study do not demonstrate a signifi-
cant increase in survival. However, other studies sup-
port the expected increase in survival with age (i.e. 
Wahl and Barbraud 2014; Väli et al. 2021). Monti et al. 
(2014) showed survival of translocated juveniles reach-
ing only 26% in their first autumn/winter season, while
in the second calendar year it reached 69%, and later
increased in adults to 93%. In France, the survival of
individuals reached 49% in their first year and as much
as 87% in the second year and in older birds (Wahl and
Page 9
Anderwald   et al. Avian Res (2021) 12:46  Page 9 of 10
Barbraud 2014). Even higher rates were noted in Swed-
ish Ospreys; 65% of year-old birds survived the first
year and 81% thereafter (Ryttman 1994). In Latvia and
Estonia, survival of 1-year old birds was reached only
14% for young females and 27% for young males, while
in older individuals it reached 64% and 74%,  respec-
tively (Väli et al. 2021). In North America, survival in
the first year was estimated to be as much as 47%, while
in adults to ca. 81% (Henny and Wight 1969). All of
these data reported above were based on ringing recov-
eries and were much higher than the ones reported in
our telemetry study. Certainly, GPS devices are more
precise in showing where and when mortality exactly
occurred and probably less biased than survival esti-
mates from capture-recapture methods. At the same
time GPS tags themselves were not found to affect sur-
vival of followed individuals (Väli et al. 2021).
In the case of adults, a huge part of mortality was
attributed to anthropogenic reasons. We have noted sur-
prisingly small mortality on migration, contrary to what
is expected, given the results of Klaassen et al. (2014) 
on a few migratory birds of prey species, including the
Osprey. However, probably also in our case, the mortality
on migration is higher and at least some individuals that
stopped transmitting on migration, actually perished. 
Birds’ corpses were not found in those cases, which is
not surprising especially in the deserts. However, con-
sidering the early death of unknown reason of individual
just reaching the wintering grounds and two individuals
missing while flying through deserts, eastern popula-
tion seems more susceptible to losses on migration. This
corresponds to greater distance they covered, especially
at the most hazardous points on the migration route
(sea and desert; Fig. 4b). Greater distance covered dur-
ing migration is associated with a higher risk of mortal-
ity in Ospreys, but also in other migratory birds of prey
(de Pascalis et al. 2020). The mortality reasons are not
necessarily directly linked to longer and more hazardous
paths, but may impact the birds’ condition by weakening
them and making them more susceptible to predation, 
poaching and starvation, i.e. “disappearing” in the deserts
or dying of unknown causes. Certainly, the high mortal-
ity of Ospreys from declining Polish population requires
further investigation to reveal the most important threats
and subsequently counteract them.
Conclusions
Two small and distinct Osprey populations showed a
clear but incomplete migratory divide, despite being sep-
arated by only a few hundred kilometres, a distance that
did not completely limit gene flow through female disper-
sal. We found high mortality rates in juvenile and adult 
Ospreys, which were relatively higher while on migration
in the case of the eastern population. There may be a link
between migration route and mortality rates that led to
the steeper decline of the eastern population; however, 
the sample size of tagged individuals is too low at the
moment to make any definite conclusions.
