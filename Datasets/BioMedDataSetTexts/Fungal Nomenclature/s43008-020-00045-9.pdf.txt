ABSTRACT
Due to their submerged and cryptic lifestyle, the vast majority of fungal species are difficult to observe and describe
morphologically, and many remain known to science only from sequences detected in environmental samples. The
lack of practices to delimit and name most fungal species is a staggering limitation to communication and
interpretation of ecology and evolution in kingdom Fungi. Here, we use environmental sequence data as
taxonomical evidence and combine phylogenetic and ecological data to generate and test species hypotheses in
the class Archaeorhizomycetes (Taphrinomycotina, Ascomycota). Based on environmental amplicon sequencing from
a well-studied Swedish pine forest podzol soil, we generate 68 distinct species hypotheses of Archaeorhizomycetes,
of which two correspond to the only described species in the class. Nine of the species hypotheses represent 78%
of the sequenced Archaeorhizomycetes community, and are supported by long read data that form the backbone
for delimiting species hypothesis based on phylogenetic branch lengths.
Soil fungal communities are shaped by environmental filtering and competitive exclusion so that closely related
species are less likely to co-occur in a niche if adaptive traits are evolutionarily conserved. In soil profiles, distinct
vertical horizons represent a testable niche dimension, and we found significantly differential distribution across
samples for a well-supported pair of sister species hypotheses. Based on the combination of phylogenetic and
ecological evidence, we identify two novel species for which we provide molecular diagnostics and propose
names. While environmental sequences cannot be automatically translated to species, they can be used to
generate phylogenetically distinct species hypotheses that can be further tested using sequences as ecological
evidence. We conclude that in the case of abundantly and frequently observed species, environmental sequences
can support species recognition in the absences of physical specimens, while rare taxa remain uncaptured at our
sampling and sequencing intensity.

INTRODUCTION
Species are fundamental units of biodiversity. There is
general support for species as entities with their own evo-
lutionary identity and fate, i.e. separately evolving meta-
population lineages, the principle upon which the unified
species concept is built (De Queiroz 2007; De Queiroz
1998). Nevertheless, it remains challenging to operation-
ally delimit species. It is increasingly evident that morph-
ology-based taxonomy is not a feasible approach to
systematically classify most eukaryotic microorganisms,
including fungi (Hibbett 2016) and protists (Keeling and
Burki 2019). Diagnostic morphological characters may not
be readily available even in some macroscopic animals
(Fišer et al. 2018), calling for use of different types of data,
including DNA-based methods for delimitation and classi-
fication of cryptic species (Dayrat 2005; Padial et al. 2010;
Yeates et al. 2011). Often, molecular data play a key role
in taxonomy, for example, by utilizing phylogenetic evi-
dence to test hypotheses of species boundaries that were
developed using morphological evidence. Over the last
decade, DNA-based species delimitation has resolved hun-
dreds of cryptic species, and species diagnosis based solely
on DNA sequence data is increasingly accepted in algae
(Leliaert et al. 2014). Molecular phylogenetic evidence is
also increasingly important, in particular for species de-
limitation in groups of fungi where it is challenging to
identify diagnostic morphological characters (Linde et al.
2017).
Ecological species delimitation is another way of rec-
ognizing species (De Queiroz 2007).  In nature, niche
partitioning is an important process that allows co-exist-
ence of species with similar resource requirements
(Schoener 1974) such as soil fungal communities (Peay
et al. 2008).  In accordance with the expectation that
closely related species have separate niches in at least
one dimension, vertical separation has been demon-
strated for sister species of soil fungi as a result of com-
petitive avoidance (Mujic et al. 2016).
Currently, the roughly 140,000 described fungal spe-
cies are predicted to represent less than one tenth of the
true fungal diversity (Hibbett 2016). The submerged life-
style and microscopic, morphological simplicity of fungi
complicates their discovery and formal nomenclature be-
cause the physical specimens or images required for
naming species in accordance with the International
Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi and Plants
(ICNafp) can often not be isolated or identified. Many of
the undescribed fungi are known from environmental
studies using amplicon sequencing (Nilsson et al. 2019a)
and are among those referred to as “dark taxa” (Ryberg
and Nilsson 2018).  Efforts to culture and image “dark
taxa” are scarce, and as in the case of the current study,
often fruitless, in part because we know so little about
these organisms. 
One approach to identifying hypothetical species and
assigning them an identifier using environmental se-
quence data is via a cluster-based reference system that
includes both environmental and ex-type sequences, for
example “virtual taxa” of the MaarjAM database (Öpik
et al. 2010) or “species hypotheses” of the UNITE data-
base (Kõljalg et al. 2013; Nilsson et al. 2019b). Such da-
tabases are valuable tools for identification of
environmental amplicon sequences. However, clustering
of often short, single locus sequence data from complex
environmental samples cannot replace taxonomy, since
outputs are context-dependent and similarity cutoffs re-
main arbitrary (Ryberg 2015).  Alternatives to cluster-
based approaches instead use phylogenetic evidence to
test which clades are best supported as species based on
the difference in expected branch lengths within and be-
tween species due to the different processes generating
them (Pons et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2013).  These
methods do not depend on preset cut-offs, but their suc-
cess still depends on how distinct the difference in
within and between species branch length is, taxon sam-
pling, and potential artifacts in the inferred phylogenetic
tree (Ahrens et al. 2016; Fujisawa and Barraclough
2013).
Some researchers cite concerns with the use of envir-
onmental sequences from complex samples to detect
taxa (Thines et al. 2018; Zamora et al. 2018),  partially
because sequence variation within OTUs is both bio-
logical and artifactual. By including sequence quality
data alongside the raw reads, artificial noise can be re-
duced and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) can be in-
ferred. Using ASVs instead of sequences representing
OTUs can facilitate cross-comparison between studies
and make it possible to get an insight into the intra- vs
inter- specific sequence variation, which helps resolve
species hypotheses.
One particularly enigmatic lineage filled with “dark
taxa” is the fungal class Archaeorhizomycetes (Taphrino-
mycotina,  Ascomycota) (Rosling et al. 2011).  Sequences
of Archaeorhizomycetes are frequently observed in envir-
onmental DNA samples from soil and roots, and have
been detected in more than 100 environmental studies
(Hibbett 2016; Menkis et al. 2014). Based on clustering
of published environmental amplicon sequences, the
class is likely to comprise at least 500 species with a
wide geographical distribution, occurring in terrestrial
environments around the globe (Menkis et al. 2014).
The annotated fungal sequence database UNITE (ver-
sion 8.0) (Kõljalg et al. 2013) currently has 195 species
hypotheses classified as Archaeorhizomycetes at the 1.5%
dissimilarity threshold. Richness estimates based on clus-
tering at 98.5% of environmental sequences available as
Short Read Archive data indicate that Archaeorhizomy-
cetes could encompass as many as 16,231 OTUs

(Lücking and Hawksworth 2018).  Previously known as
Soil Clone Group 1 based on environmental sequence
data (Porter et al. 2008; Schadt et al. 2003), the first liv-
ing specimen was isolated into pure culture and validly
named in 2011: Archaeorhizomyces finlayi Rosling & T.
James (Rosling et al. 2011). To date, only one additional
species, Archaeorhizomyces borealis Menkis, T. James &
Rosling (Menkis et al. 2014), has been isolated and de-
scribed. Even if the species richness estimates based on
environmental sequence data are inflated due to sequen-
cing errors or artefacts of OTU clustering methods
(Lücking and Hawksworth 2018), the two name-bearing
species in the class certainly represent a small fraction of
the true diversity. While little is currently known about
the ecology and lifestyles of species in the Archaeorhizo-
mycetes, studies using environmental sequences indicate
that the class is both abundant and diverse in a range of
terrestrial ecosystems (Carrino-Kyker et al. 2016; Clem-
mensen et al. 2015; Cruz-Paredes et al. 2019; Fernández-
Martínez et al. 2017; Geml et al. 2014; He et al. 2019;
Kluting et al. 2019; Kyaschenko et al. 2017; Levy-Booth
et al. 2019; Maghnia et al. 2017; Pinto-Figueroa et al.
2019; Rosling et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2016).  In several
studies, its abundance is linked to ecological patterns,
such as succession and nutrient availability, highlighting
the urgent need to recognize species in the class to fa-
cilitate communication and identify ecological patterns
across studies. Despite extensive culturing efforts, no
further cultures of Archaeorhizomycetes were success-
fully isolated in the current study.
To estimate diversity of Archaeorhizomycetes,  as well
as many other under-described fungal lineages, environ-
mental sequence analysis needs to be developed for spe-
cies hypothesis testing. High abundance in
environmental sequence datasets and access to reference
sequences for all described species makes Archaeorhizo-
mycetes an excellent case to develop novel taxonomic
approaches for describing species known only from en-
vironmental sequences, without the risk of creating con-
fusion with respect to species lacking description of
homologous gene regions. Previous studies have revealed
a diverse Archaeorhizomycetes community that is both
abundant and vertically stratified at our study site
(Fransson and Rosling 2014; Lindahl et al. 2007).  We
combined long and short read ASVs to delimit species
hypotheses (SH) in Archaeorhizomycetes using the
branch length model PTP (Zhang et al. 2013), and test
these using ecological species recognition. We hypothe-
sized that sister SHs would have different realized
niches, defined as colonization of visually distinct Podzol
soil horizons, and tested this using short read relative
abundance across soil horizons as a proxy for niche dis-
tribution. By combining two lines of evidence, we firmly
delimit and describe two novel species. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Field site, sampling, culturing and soil DNA extraction
Soil samples were collected in mid-October 2013 from a
pine forest at Ivantjärnsheden field station close to
Jädraås (60°49′N, 16°30′E, altitude 185 m) (Persson
1980) (Method S1). Between 1974 and 1990, an experi-
mental field study [experiment Ih2 (9802)] (Axelsson
and Bråkenhielm 1980) (Fig. S1) with three different
treatments: irrigation and fertilization (IF), irrigation (I),
un-manipulated control (UM), and a later clear cut plots
(CC) was conducted in the stand. After peeling back the
top shrub and moss layer, we collected five soil cores
from five locations in each 30 × 30 m plot. Soil cores
were separated into visually distinct podzol soil layers:
organic soil (O, approximately 0–5 cm depth),  mineral
elluvial soil (E, 5–8 cm) and mineral illuvial soil (B, 8–15
cm), before pooling the layers for each plot for a total of
36 samples (Table S1). Later, roots were separated from
the soil samples for an extensive culturing effort
attempting to isolate species in Archaeorhizomycetes
(Grelet et al. 2010; Menkis et al. 2014; Rosling et al.
2011) (Method S1). We obtained 160 cultures, and suc-
cessfully sequenced rDNA genes from 98 of these with
primers ITS1, ITS4, and LR3 (Gardes and Bruns 1993;
Hopple Jr and Vilgalys 1994; White et al. 1990). None of
the sequences (deposited in GenBank under accessions
MH843963-MH844060) matched Archaeorhizomycetes.
From the 36 composite soil sample, DNA was extracted
using the (Xpedition™ Soil/Fecal DNA miniprep, Zymo
Research Corporation, Irvine, California, USA) (Urbina
et al. 2016) (Method S2). Two different sequence data-
sets were generated from these samples: 1) a “phylogen-
etic” dataset of long amplicons using PacBio SMRT, and
2) an “ecological” dataset based on short read metabar-
coding using IonTorrent. The longer reads in the
“phylogenetic” sequence dataset provides enough infor-
mation to resolve deeper nodes in the Archaeorhizomy-
cetes tree while the “ecological”  dataset provides
sufficient sequencing depth and replication to test for
species specific realized niches.
Generating the “phylogenetic” sequence dataset
Approximately 1,500 bp of the rDNA ITS and LSU re-
gion was amplified from all soil DNA extracts using the
primer set ITS1F (Gardes and Bruns 1993) and LR5
(Hopple Jr and Vilgalys 1994), with Phusion High-Fidel-
ity DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wal-
tham, Massachusetts, USA) (Methods S3). A total of 5, 8
and 3 samples successfully amplified by PCR for O, E
and B horizons, respectively (Table S1), and PCR prod-
ucts were pooled separately for the three soil horizons to
generate the amplicon libraries (SwO, SwE and SwB) for
sequencing at SciLifeLab/NGI (Uppsala, Sweden) on a
PacBio RS II system (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park,
Page 4
Kalsoom Khan et al. IMA Fungus (2020) 11:23  Page 4 of 12
CA, USA). Sequences were delivered to us as error-cor-
rected FASTQ files, and raw reads for the current study
are available in ENA (samples ERS3508481-
ERS3508483).
The “phylogenetic” sequence dataset was filtered, and
long read sequence dataset of all amplified sequence var-
iants (ASVs) was generated using DADA2 (version 1.9.3)
(Callahan et al. 2016) (Method S3). Taxonomy was pre-
dicted with the ITS2 region using the SINTAX classifier
(Edgar 2010) as implemented in VSEARCH (version
2.10.4) (Rognes et al. 2016), and the USEARCH/UTAX
reference dataset (version 8.0) (UNITE Community
2019), available from the UNITE database (Kõljalg et al.
2013).  This reference dataset was customized by re-
placing unassigned species level taxonomy with UNITE
SH when available.
ASVs belonging to Archaeorhizomycetes were identi-
fied by aligning the LSU region of the 276 ASVs with
the LSU sequences of A. finlayi (JF836022), A. borealis
(KF993708) and the uncultured sister lineage of Archae-
orhizomycetes GS31 (KY687760) (Tedersoo et al. 2017)
using Geneious (version 11.1.4) (Kearse et al. 2012).  A
maximum likelihood tree using RAxML XSED2 (version
8) using the GTRGAMMA model following recommen-
dations on parametrization in (Kelchner and Thomas
2007),  and 1000 iterations for the calculation of boot-
strap support (Stamatakis 2014) in the CIPRES portal
(Miller et al. 2010). The tree was rooted with two Rozel-
lomycota sequences (ASV_229 and ASV_237).  Tax-
onomy predictions with a confidence value of 0.8 or
higher using class when available, or else phyla or do-
main was added to the ASV name using a customized
script. Forty-two ASVs representing Archaeorhizomy-
cetes were identified as those forming a well-supported
clade together with A. borealis and A. finlayi, and dis-
tinct from GS31 (Fig. S2).  The corresponding 42 full-
length ASVs were aligned in Geneious, and a ML tree
was generated in the CIPRES portal as described above.
Removing one chimeric sequence resulted in a high
quality Archaeorhizomycetes rDNA sequence dataset
consisting of 41 ASVs ranging in length from 1373 to
1801 bp together representing 52,274 reads (Fig. S2,
Table S2, S3). In the end, 272 ASV sequences including
assigned taxonomy level with a confidence value of 0.8
or above were published in GBIF ([URL: "https://doi.org/10.15468/8zymuf"] https://doi.org/10.
 15468/8zymuf) and are available in UNITE with acces-
sion numbers UDB0779092-UDB0779901.
Generating the “ecological” sequence dataset
The ITS2 region of the rDNA genes was amplified using
primers gITS7 forward (Ihrmark et al. 2012) and modi-
fied ITS4m reverse (Urbina et al. 2016) using barcoded
primers (Table S1) (Method S4). Six PCR products were
amplified from each soil sample using a  CFR96 
Touch™Real/Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad La-
boratories) as previously described (Urbina et al. 2016).
Replicates were combined before purification, and a se-
quencing library was prepared by pooling maximum 35
ng PCR products from each sample including both nega-
tive and positive template controls, loaded onto a 318
chip for PGM Ion Torrent sequencing technology (Life
Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, US),  and se-
quenced at SciLifeLab/NGI (Uppsala, Sweden).  The
current study was sequenced together with four other
studies from different ecosystems for a total of 96 sam-
ples on the IonTorrent chip. A total of 4,805,942 raw se-
quence reads were demultiplexed by the sequencing
facility and provided as 96 FASTQ files. Raw reads for
the current study are available in ENA (samples
ERS4600640-ERS4600675).
The software package DADA2 (version 1.14.0) (Calla-
han et al. 2016) for R (version 3.6.1) (R Core Team,
2019) was used to quality filter the raw reads and infer
ASVs after removing primer sequences with cutadapt
(version 2.6 with Python version 3.7.5) (Martin 2011)
(Method S4). All 96 samples from the chip were pooled
for ASV inference and chimera detection, resulting in a
total of 4822 ASVs, representing 1,804,814 reads (37.6%
of raw reads). For clarity, ASVs generated from IonTor-
rent data are called itASVs throughout the text. After re-
moving non-fungal itASVs and itASV_1 (the positive
control sequence), the dataset consisted of 4461 itASVs
and 1,680,044 reads, of which 282 itASVs and 425,349
reads were putatively Archaeorhizomycetes across the se-
quencing run. The R package vegan (version 2.5–6)
(Oksanen et al. 2013) was used to conduct an nMDS or-
dination of the fungal itASV occurrence matrix across
all samples based on per-sample relative abundances
using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index (Fig. S3).  Fi-
nally, the ”ecological” dataset was generated by removing
all samples from other studies, controls and all itASVs
occurring only once across the 36 Jädraås samples. The
count-per-sample matrix of the “ecological”  dataset
covers 1664 itASVs (619,176 reads) ([URL: "https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/96DKZ"] Supplementary
[URL: "https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/96DKZ"] datafile 1), and the sequences are published in GenBank
(accession numbers MT926458-MT928121).  Of these,
123 itASVs (233,667 reads; 37.7% of Jädraås fungal
reads) were putatively Archaeorhizomycetes (Table S4,
 Supplementary datafile 2).
Delimiting phylogenetic species hypotheses based on
environmental sequences
We combined the two sequence datasets described
above to delimitate species supported by both phylogen-
etic and ecological species recognition. In brief, we used
PTP to generate species hypotheses (SHs) based on
branch length distribution in a ML tree including both
long ASVs and itASVs (Zhang et al. 2013).  SH
Page 5
Kalsoom Khan et al. IMA Fungus (2020) 11:23  Page 5 of 12
distribution across samples was estimated based on
combined read counts for all itASVs mapped into a SH.
Well-supported sister SHs, i.e. pairs of SHs supported by
long read data, were tested for having different realized
niches using their relative abundance in the total fungal
community. The procedure is specified in Method S5.
Placement of local SHs among published
Archaeorhizomycetes sequences
To place Archaeorhizomycetes SHs from the current
study in a larger phylogenetic context, an alignment that
included publicly available environmental sequences pre-
viously identified as belonging to the Archaeorhizomy-
cetes (Menkis et al. 2014),  as well as new sequences
affiliated with the class as identified by BLAST search in
UNITE (Altschul et al. 1990), was generated in Geneious
(Method S6). Environmental sequences were included if
they covered at least two of the three rDNA regions
ITS1, ITS2 or LSU. Duplicate sequences from individual
studies were excluded. To focus the analysis on SHs
from the current study, a series of alignments and ML
trees were generated through a process of stepwise re-
moval of published sequences that separated on deep
nodes without sequences generated in the current study.
The final alignment included a total of 172 Archaeorhi-
zomycetes sequences in addition to the 41 ASVs gener-
ated in the current study and six outgroup sequences
(alignment and tree are available in TreeBASE Study
S26320).  Global SHs were delimitated across the tree
using the bPTP portal and visualized in TreeView by
collapsing ML solution SHs as above. All included
Archaeorhizomycetes sequences were mapped to UNITE
species hypotheses at 98.5% by massBLAST of their ITS
region ([URL: "https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/96DKZ"] Supplementary datafile 6).  The generated tree
allowed us to evaluate the robustness of phylogenetic
species delimitation in our local dataset and to visualize
global sister clade relationships. Further, the larger
Archaeorhizomycetes alignment was used to visually in-
spect and identify diagnostic sequences regions in both
the ITS1 and ITS2 region for two novel species first hy-
pothesized as SH_7 and SH_8 (Fig. 1).
RESULTS
Across all samples in the studied pine forest, 33% of the
sequenced fungal community was assigned to class
Archaeorhizomycetes in the short amplicon “ecological”
dataset (Table S4). In the “phylogenetic” dataset on the
other hand, the class represents 26% of the fungal reads
(Table S2).  Despite representing a large proportion of
the total fungal reads in the dataset (Fig. S4) and intense
cultivation efforts, no isolates of Archaeorhizomycetes
were successfully obtained. We did not detect a signifi-
cant relationship between the relative abundance of class
Archaeorhizomycetes and soil horizon (Fig. S5, Table S5) 
or treatment (Table S5).  However, the number of
Archaeorhizomycetes itASVs and SHs were significantly
affected by soil horizon (Table S5), with higher richness
detected in B horizon compared to both O and E hori-
zon (Fig. S6). Across all samples, 68 SHs of Archaeorhi-
zomycetes were delimited, nine of which were supported
by reads in the “phylogenetic” dataset, one of which in-
cluded the reference sequence of A. finlayi (Fig. 1, Fig.
S7).  The most abundant SHs were supported by long
read data in the “phylogenetic” dataset (Fig. S4), together
accounting for 78% of the Archaeorhizomycetes reads
identified in the “ecological” dataset. Likely due to the
lower sequencing depth of the “phylogenetic” dataset,
taxa making up less than 1% of the sequenced fungal
community were not consistently recovered in long read
ASVs (Fig. S4).
The Archaeorhizomycetes community composition was
structured by soil horizons (Fig. S8), and model testing
showed that the relative abundance in the “ecological”
dataset of nine SHs supported by long reads was signifi-
cantly affected by soil horizon (PERMANOVA: SH vs
Horizon df = 2, F = 4.6070, P < 0.001) as well as by treat-
ment and plot (Table S6).  SH distribution also varied
with plot*treatment interactions (df = 3, F = 2.0344, P >
0.005) (Table S6).  Since treatment plots are spatially
structured (Fig. S1), we could not separate treatment ef-
fects from spatial effects. We conclude that across treat-
ments and plots, soil horizons likely reflect niches
explored differently by these fungi. While most of the
nine SHs were not significantly associated with a single
horizon, we found a marginally significant effect of O
horizon on relative abundance of A. finlayi (df = 2, χ2 =
9.457, pcorrected 
= 0.792) (Table S7) which was found at
highest relative abundance in the B horizons (Fig. S9).
For two sister pairs of phylogenetically well-supported
SHs that were both abundant and frequently observed
(Fig. S4, Table S8),  we found significant differences in
realized niche for SHs within each pair (Fig. 1, Table
S9). Based on their relative sequence read abundance in
the fungal community across soil horizons, SH_7 and
SH_8 had significantly different niche distributions
(Pr(>F) = 0.02985). Differential niche distribution of SH_
1 and SH_2 was marginally significant (Pr(>F) = 0.0995;
Table S9). This ecological evidence provides further sup-
port for the phylogenetically delimited SH_7 and SH_8
as distinct species with robust boundaries.
Global perspective on recognized taxa
The site-specific Archaeorhizomycetes diversity (Fig. 1)
was analyzed in a global perspective by populating an
alignment of ASVs from our “phylogenetic” dataset with
publicly available environmental sequences that formed
well-supported clades with long read ASVs from Archae-
orhizomycetes from the current study (Fig. 2, Fig. S10,

Fig. 1 Maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference demonstrating the diversity of Archaeorhizomycetes in mid-Sweden pine forest podzol soil
based on environmental ribosomal long (41 sequences with ITS and LSU) and short (98 sequences with ITS2) ASVs representing 68 species
hypotheses (SH) based on Maximum likelihood solutions in bPTP. Two SHs includes sequences of the described species Archaeorhizomyces
borealis and Archaeorhizomyces finlayi. The tree includes the undescribed sister lineage GS31 (Tedersoo, et al. 2017) and four Taphrinomycotina
species as outgroup. SHs are cartooned to their stem node to visualize SH represented by more than one ASV. Nine SHs (numbers 1–9) include
long read ASVs from the current study and are highlighted in large bold font. Remaining cartooned terminal nodes were represented only by
short read itASVs from the current study and are labeled with SH_number or A. borealis. Bootstrap support values over 75 are shown on the
branches (calculated from 1000 iterations). Average relative sequence read abundance in soil horizons O, E and B are inserted as tables for two
pairs of sister SHs. Bent arrows indicate tested orthogonal contrasts with Pr(>F)-values shown in the middle (See Fig. S7a for corresponding tree
with all ASV labels displayed).
 Supplementary datafile 6). A total of 76 global SHs were
delimited and supported using a PTP model, 41 of which
are represented by a single sequence (Fig. 2). However,
some of the SHs delimited in the local dataset (Fig. 1)
were not stable after the removal of short read itASVs
and the addition of published environmental sequences.
Most notably, SH_2, SH_5 and SH_9 (identified as A.
finlayi) each split in the global ML tree (Fig. 2).  SH_2
separates into two global SHs, both containing se-
quences previously recovered from the studied field site,
with SH_2:2 being the more frequently observed of the
two and including long sequences in UNITE 
SH1566367.08FU, while sequences in SH 2:1 did not
map to any existing UNITE SHs ([URL: "https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/96DKZ"] Supplementary datafile
6). SH_5 also separates into two global SHs, with SH_5:1
containing previously published sequences from our field
site, as well as sequences from Ireland and the US, while
global SH_5:2 contained only two ASVs from the
current study ([URL: "https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/96DKZ"] Supplementary datafile 6).  Both global
SH_5:1 and SH_5:2 cluster on a well-supported branch
with four global SHs that include previously published
sequences (Fig. 2). Sequences in three of these SHs map
to the same UNITE SH (SH1571336.08FU), demonstrat-
ing that the boundaries of phylogenetically delimited

Fig. 2 Maximum likelihood tree including all long read ASVs from the current study and publicly available environmental and reference
sequences of Archaeorhizomycetes covering at least two of the rDNA regions ITS1, ITS2 and LSU. The tree is limited to environmental sequences
that cluster on well-supported basal nodes with long read ASV sequences from the current study. Nodes represent 76 species hypothesis (SH)
based on Maximum likelihood solutions in bPTP. Nodes including ASVs from the current study are cartooned to visualize how many sequences
are included and labeled with SH_number according to Fig. 1, followed by ML support value for species delineation based on bPTP in
parenthesis. Names for two described and two novel species are included in bold for their corresponding SHs. Following addition of
environmental sequences, three local SHs split, as indicated by adding:1 and:2 after the SH number. SHs including only publicly available
sequences are collapsed. Placement of previously published sequences from the studied field station is indicated by *. Bootstrap supports are
calculated from 1000 iterations and indicated only when 80 or higher on branches leading up to SH from the current study. Full set of support
values and sequence names are available in Fig. S10
SHs and cluster-based SHs are not always the same. Fur-
ther, ASVs and published sequences mapping to
SH1556760.08FU, A. finlayi,  split into two global SHs
(SH_9:1 and SH_9:2) in the current analysis (Fig. 2,
 Supplementary datafile 6).  These two SHs cluster on a
well-supported branch with five single sequence SHs
mapping to four different UNITE SHs. Limited taxon
sampling and low representation of intra-species genetic
variation of potential sister taxa as well as possible chi-
meras among published sequences within the clade may
obscure phylogenetic SH delimitation.
The included sequences represent only a fraction of
the global Archaeorhizomycetes diversity, including se-
quences from 90 of the 181 UNITE SH currently 
identified as belonging to Archaeorhizomycetes (Kõljalg
et al. 2013).  With the exception of SH_4 and SH_2:1,
long read ASVs mapped to UNITE SH, meaning that
the majority of our ASVs were highly similar to previ-
ously observed environmental sequences ([URL: "https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/96DKZ"] Supplementary
 datafile 6).  Archaeorhizomyces borealis is distributed
across the Eurasian boreal biome (Menkis et al. 2014)
but was rare at our study site and was only detected as a
short amplicon itASV.
In the global analysis, the sister taxa SH_7 and SH_8
cluster together with three single sequences (Fig. 2). One
of these (GenBank Acc nr: JN006470) represents se-
quences from UK and Germany (Cox et al. 2010) and
clusters closely to SH_7. This sequence maps to UNITE
Page 8
Kalsoom Khan et al. IMA Fungus (2020) 11:23  Page 8 of 12
SH1566370.08FU, together with sequences in SH_7
([URL: "https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/96DKZ"] Supplementary datafile 6). The other two sequences are
from Canada and the US and map to UNITE
SH1566388.08FU ([URL: "https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/96DKZ"] Supplementary datafile 6).  Based on
the GlobalFungi database ([URL: "http://globalfungi.com"] globalfungi.com) (Vetrovsky
et al. 2020) the later SH is restricted to North America.
Together, these observations indicate that closely related
taxa exist globally, but that these could be geographically
separated from those captured in our dataset. While
addition of publicly available environmental sequences
weakened the PTP ML support for these two SHs, both
remain intact. In the global tree, the delimitation of SH_
7 and SH_8 both include sequences previously recovered
from the studied field site as well as sequences collected
throughout Europe ([URL: "https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/96DKZ"] Supplementary datafile 7).  These
two SHs are distinct based on both local (Fig. 1) and glo-
bal (Fig. 2) phylogenetic evidence, as well as ecological
evidence, since they have significantly different realized
niches across samples in the studied Podzol profile (Fig.
S9, Table S9).  Overall, relative abundance of SH_8 is
higher (8.9 ± 1.7%) across all three horizons compared to
SH_7 (3.5 ± 1.2%). Relative abundance of SH_8 is highest
in O horizon and decreases towards deeper mineral soil
layers while the relative abundance of PH_7 is stable
throughout the soil profile (Fig. S9b). SH_8 tends to rep-
resent a larger proportion of the sequenced fungal com-
munity compared to SH_7 when the two are detected
together, high relative abundance of SH_7 is restricted
to when the relative abundance of SH_8 is low (Fig. S9c)
indicating competitive avoidance between the two 
species similar to patterns of vertical separation previ-
ously observed for soil fungal sister species (Mujic et al.
2016).
Based on combined phylogenetic and ecological evi-
dence, we propose two novel species, Archaeorhizomyces
secundus nom. seq. for SH_7 and Archaeorhizomyces vic-
tor nom. seq. for SH_8. Names are appended with nom.
seq. to indicate that the names are based on a sequence
in the absence of acceptable type material (Lücking and
Hawksworth 2018). We also provide short diagnostic se-
quences in the ITS1 and ITS2 region to distinguish the
two species from each other and from the two described
species in the class (Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
The class Archaeorhizomycetes is diverse, ubiquitous,
and often highly abundant in environmental DNA sam-
ples from around the world (Rosling et al. 2011). With
only two formally named and thus recognized species,
very little is known about the ecology, morphology, and
life styles of the species within Archaeorhizomycetes
(Menkis et al. 2014; Rosling et al. 2011). Species within
the class are likely to have different ecological roles and
occupy different niches in soil horizons (Rosling et al.
2013), but intra-taxonomic boundaries have only begun
to be characterized within this lineage. The goal of this
study was to investigate the diversity of Archaeorhizomy-
cetes at Ivantjärnsheden field station, a well-studied site
from which occurrences of OTUs representing species
of Archaeorhizomyces have been repeatedly documented
(Fransson and Rosling 2014; Lindahl et al. 2007).  We
have demonstrated the notable difficulty associated with
obtaining pure cultures of Archaeorhizomycetes,  even
from such site with known high richness and abundance
based on amplicon sequencing. This prevents us from
collecting traditional sources of evidence for species de-
scriptions, such as morphological characterization, and
we have instead delineated two novel species of Archae-
orhizomycetes using alternative lines of evidence inferred
from environmental sequence data.
By combining phylogenetic and ecological evidence,
we show that these two species are different from each
other and from previously described species. We propose
the names A. secundus nom. seq. and A. victor nom. seq.
for them, and have appended the names with nom. seq.
to represent their status, in line with the recommenda-
tions of Lücking and Hawksworth (2018). To avoid fu-
ture confusion, we plea that these names are continued
to be used if and when material becomes available to
give them valid names in accordance with ICNafp. It is
important to remember the function of a name: as a tool
Page 10
Kalsoom Khan et al. IMA Fungus (2020) 11:23  Page 10 of 12
to label and communicate a defined object or concept.
We hope that by applying and using these names, we
will be able to accumulate knowledge about these spe-
cies faster, and potentially expediate discovery of repre-
centative living specimens.
CONCLUSION
Diversity estimates indicate that the majority of fungal
species remain known only from sequences detected in
environmental samples. We demonstrate that environ-
mental sequences and their accompanying metadata can
be used as phylogenetic and environmental evidence to
build and test species hypothesis. In the absences of
physical specimens, environmental sequence data may
facilitate species discovery in lineages of abundantly and
frequently observed, yet largely unknown, taxa such as
the Archaeorhizomycetes.
