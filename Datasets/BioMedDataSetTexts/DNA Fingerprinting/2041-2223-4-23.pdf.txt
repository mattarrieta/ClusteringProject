DNA fingerprinting in anthropological genetics:
past, present, future
Michael H Crawford* and Kristine G Beaty
Abstract
In 1985, Sir Alec Jeffreys developed the variable-number tandem repeat method used to identify individuals and
giving researchers the first DNA fingerprints. These initial methods were used in anthropological genetics, a field
that uses a comparative approach to answer questions about human history, including the discernment of the
origin of Native American populations and the discrimination of clan affiliation from individuals in Siberia. The
technological and methodological advances since this time have led to the use of many more markers, including
restriction fragment length polymorphisms, Y chromosomal and autosomal short tandem repeats, single nucleotide
polymorphisms, and direct sequencing not only to identify individuals, but to examine frequencies and distributions
of markers (or “prints”) of entire populations. In the field of anthropological genetics these markers have been used
to reconstruct evolutionary history and answer questions concerning human origins and diaspora, migration, and
the effects of admixture and adaptation to different environments, as well as susceptibility and resistance to disease.
This review discusses the evolution of DNA markers since their application by Sir Alec Jeffreys and their applications
in anthropological genetics.

Introduction
Anthropological genetics is a synthetic field that examines
evolutionary theory of interest to anthropologists while
applying genetic methodologies [1]. This intimate relation-
ship between genetics and anthropology was first charac-
terized in 1973, in a volume entitled Methods and
Theories of Anthropological Genetics [2]. This initial syn-
thesis was followed by three volumes on Current Develop-
ments in Anthropological Genetics [3-5]. The far-reaching
impact of the molecular revolution on the field of an-
thropological genetics in the 1980s and 1990s was assessed
by a volume entitled Anthropological Genetics: Theory,
Methods and Applications [6]. The field of anthropological
genetics utilizes a comparative approach on small, isolated
populations and topics such as human variation, evolu-
tionary theory, reconstruction of the human diaspora
(out-of-Africa),  genetic epidemiology, and forensic sci-
ences [7].  Anthropological geneticists (particularly from

Institute) have been successful in mapping quantitative
trait loci involved in biological pathways of diseases such
as diabetes mellitus, cancers, obesity, osteoporosis, and
coronary heart disease [8].  Schanfield has reviewed the
prominent role of anthropological genetics in cases of legal
interest, using classic genetic markers and molecular
methods [9]. See the thematic review of the application of
DNA fingerprints to forensic sciences in this special issue
of Investigative Genetics.  In population studies, genetic
markers have been defined as “discrete, segregating genetic
traits which can be used to characterize populations by
virtue of their presence, absence, or high frequency in
some populations and low frequencies in others” [10]; in a
sense, a combination of these markers can be used as a
“fingerprint” of a population. Although this definition was
first applied to blood groups and protein variation, any seg-
regating regions of DNA, present in some populations but
absent or infrequent in others, may be termed genetic
markers. Thus, variable-number tandem repeats (VNTRs),
short tandem repeats (STRs),  mitochondrial DNA hap-
logroups, Y-specific non-recombining region (NRY)

haplotypes, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
have been used as “genetic markers” to document popula-
tion history and to assess the actions of the forces of evolu-
tion. This thematic review focuses on the application of a
variety of genetic markers (from VNTRs to STRs to SNPs)
to the resolution of several evolutionary controversies. Ex-
amples of the application of these DNA fingerprints (gen-
etic markers) to evolutionary questions come primarily
from studies conducted by researchers of the Laboratory of
Biological Anthropology at the University of Kansas, and
provides a more “personalized view” of anthropological
genetics that has built upon the work that Sir Alec Jeffrey
began over 35 years ago.
Review and discussion
DNA fingerprints
In 1985, Alec Jeffreys and his colleagues developed a
method using VNTRs or minisatellites of DNA to identify
specific individuals for forensic purposes and parenthood
determination [11]. These DNA fingerprints are specific
to an individual (or to a set of monozygotic twins) with 1
in 30 billion chances that the identical patterns will be en-
countered in an unrelated individual. Southern blot meth-
odology was utilized to identify specific loci and alleles
from a multitude of DNA fragments. This method in-
volved cutting intact DNA with a sequence specific re-
striction enzyme, followed by separation of fragments
using electrophoresis, transferring these fragments onto a
nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridizing the fragments
with specific probes labeled by radioactive isotopes or bio-
tin. Numerous minisatellite loci were considered simulta-
neously, which increased the observable variation but
made it difficult to discern specific alleles. A series of frag-
ments of various lengths were digitized and grouped into
size bins and the frequencies of fragments within these bins
were calculated for each population. Because of the time-
consuming nature of this methodology and the ambiguity
associated with whether fragments within bins were specific
alleles, this Southern blot method was eventually sup-
planted by PCR-based assays [12]. The PCR methodology is
less expensive, more sensitive, less time consuming and
amplifies the specific regions of DNA, using multiplexes
and “cocktails” containing thermostable DNA polymerase.
Anthropological genetic applications of DNA fingerprints
The past
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, frequency distribu-
tions of VNTRs were used as genetic markers to discrimi-
nate between ethnically defined populations [13-15].  In
addition, because of the non-coding nature of VNTRs, high
mutation rates, and high genetic diversity, McComb et al.
applied VNTR restriction fragment length polymorphism
distributions to questions concerning the peopling of the
Americas and the characterization of the genetic structure 
of indigenous Siberian populations [16-18]. Data assessing
morphological traits and classic genetic markers suggested
a Siberian origin of Native American populations, but until
1989, DNA samples from Siberian indigenous groups were
not available to western scientists to verify this origin. Field
investigations in Siberia were made possible by the breakup
of the Soviet Union and “perestroika” (rebuilding). During
the summers of 1989–1993, an international team of re-
searchers from the University of Kansas and the Russian
Academy of Sciences, funded by the NSF, collected blood
samples from volunteers in two adjacent Evenki reindeer
herding brigades (Surinda and Poligus), a small Ket fishing/
hunting village on the Yenesei River (Sulamai), and a cattle-
herding village from Gorno-Altai (Mendur-Sokhon).  In
2002, DNA samples were collected from Even, Koryak, and
Aleut communities of Kamchatka and Bering Island. DNA
was extracted at the Laboratory of Biological Anthropology,
University of Kansas, and analyzed using Southern blots to
assign DNA fragments into length bins through digital
comparisons with sizing ladders. All statistical analyses
were based on a conservative standard error of ± 2%. Inter-
group variation was tested for statistical significance using
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons (P = 0.05). Siberian populations
clustered with the Native American groups were statisti-
cally significantly different from European and African
Americans [17] (Figure 1). In addition to DNA fingerprints,
mtDNA analyses of the same DNA samples demonstrated
that Siberian and Native American populations shared the
founding haplotypes A, B, C, and D [19]. Phillips-Krawczak
et al. later identified the presence of a Siberian X hap-
logroup in the Kizhi population of Gorno Altai [20]. Non-
recombining Y chromosome markers further verified the
Siberian origins of Native Americans [21].
Crawford et al. also utilized VNTR loci to determine clan
affiliation in the Kizhi pastoral community of Mendur-
Sokhon, Gorno Altai region of Southern Siberia [22].  A
sample of Altai Kizhi were characterized for three VNTR
loci (D7S104, D11S129 and D18S17) and linear discrimi-
nant function analysis was used to classify unknown indi-
viduals to a specific clan. The Kizhi community contained
three major clans, Irkit, Todosh, and Kipchak, and other
smaller clans. Linear discriminant function correctly classi-
fied 72% of all unknowns entered into the analysis. The
highest correct classification occurred when 80% of the re-
search subjects were placed in the Todosh clan, followed by
75% correct classification of individuals assigned to the Irkit
clan, and 60% into the Kipchak clan. Those Kizhi indivi-
duals who were not affiliated with the Irkit, Todosh, or
Kipchak were assigned randomly to a fourth group. If all of
the clan assignments were random in regards to the VNTR
loci, individuals would have been correctly assigned 25% of
the time, while the unassigned individuals were classified
into that category 29% of the time. These data suggest that

VNTR markers have detected genetic similarities within
each clan that permit a high probability of correct assign-
ment of each individual to a correct clan (Table 1).
Present
Microsatellites (STRs)
Technological advances have allowed for more efficient
means of investigating the genetic makeup of individuals
with the use of DNA fingerprints such as STRs. In an-
thropological genetics, these markers have been used as
ancestry-informative markers to reconstruct the human
diaspora and to interpret the evolutionary history of human
populations to answer questions of population origins, mi-
gration, and admixture. STRs, also known as microsatel-
lites, are sequences of 2 to 6 base pairs (bp) repeated in a
region of DNA from 3 to 100 times. Variant alleles usually
result from slipped strand mispairing during DNA replica-
tion. In this review, we focus on the anthropological genetic
questions that have been investigated during the last decade
using STRs. STR variation can be examined in a number of
different ways to test hypotheses concerning anthropo-
logical genetics. The following examples demonstrate the

usefulness of STRs in answering evolutionary questions,
such as (1) Are the Basque inhabitants of Spain and France
remnants of the Paleolithic populations of Europe prior to
the expansion of agriculture and Indo-European languages
from the Middle East, circa 10,000 years B.P.? Are they
Iberian groups that have been geographically isolated from
their neighbors or are they related to distant populations
from North Africa or the Caucasus? (2) How much gene
flow did the populations of the Aleutian Islands experience
from Russian, English, and/or Scandinavian sources? (3)
Can a single ubiquitous STR allele (D9S1120 9 RA) reveal
the number of migrations that have occurred from Siberia
into the Americas?
STRs and Basque origins
Are the Basque populations remnants of the Paleolithic
settlers of Europe and/or do they show affinities to popula-
tions of the Caucasus or North Africa? Most of the early
molecular genetic studies of Basque populations were
based primarily on small samples of school children or
adults from urban sites, with some admixture with the sur-
rounding Spanish communities [23]. The Vizcaya Province
sample (68 unrelated volunteers) revealed, on the basis of
13 autosomal STR loci, that the Basques are outliers rela-
tive to neighboring Spanish and the more distant North
African populations. Young et al. characterized a total of
404 DNA samples for nine autosomal STR loci collected
from rural villages and towns of four Basque Provinces
[24]. Multidimensional scaling based on Shriver’s Dsw 
dis-
tance matrix did not support the hypothesis of a recent
common ancestry between the Basques and populations
from the Caucasus or North Africa [25].  STR, mtDNA,
and NRY genetic markers indicate that the Basques are dis-
tinct from the surrounding Spanish populations but also

differ from the inhabitants of the Caucasus and North
Africa. The most parsimonious explanation for the distri-
bution of the genetic markers is that the contemporary
Basques are descendants of the earliest Paleolithic migrants
into Europe. However, recent analyses of ancient DNA
from early Neolithic farmers and hunter-gatherers suggest
that the maternal genetic contribution of farmers coming
from the Middle East is higher than previously suspected
[26,27].
Aleutian island admixture
Estimates of gene flow and admixture in human popula-
tions may vary depending on which specific genetic
markers are used to characterize the populations. If the
indigenous Aleutian island populations are characte-
rized solely by mitochondrial DNA haplogroups shown
in Figure 2, only the native haplogroups A (shown in
blue) and D (shown in orange) are observed [28]. Based
solely on these data, one might conclude that there was
no gene flow from Russian, English, or Scandinavian
populations into the Aleutian Islands. However, mor-
phologically, the Aleuts appear to be highly admixed. In
Figure 3, NRY haplotypes based on SNPs indicate that
only 15% of the Y chromosomes from male participants
of the Aleutian archipelago were either Q* or Q3
(shown in light orange and orange), considered Native 
American paternal lineages [29].  Thus, 85% of the Y
chromosomes of the Aleutian Islands inhabitants are of
European origin, primarily R1b (dark green) or R1a (dark
blue),  depending on whether the samples are from the
western or eastern islands [30]. The calculation of admix-
ture (using the program Admix 3.1) based on nine auto-
somal STR loci revealed that approximately 40% of the
genes in the Bering gene pool were of Russian origin while
60% were Aleut. Genetic markers that recombine, such as
STRs, provide a more accurate assessment of the total
contents of an admixed gene pool in human populations,
but fail to detect gender-specific patterns of gene flow.
Private STR alleles and migration into the Americas
The frequencies of private STR alleles and their ubiquitous
distributions can provide invaluable information concern-
ing the evolutionary history of populations. Schroeder
et al. described a private STR allele (D9S1120 9 RA), which
is ubiquitous in the Americas but present in only two indi-
genous Siberian populations, Koryaks and Chukchi, both
groups located proximally to the former location of the
land bridge, Beringia (Figure 4) [31]. While this private al-
lele, shown in orange, is frequent in the Americas and in
two Siberian populations, it is absent in Europe, Africa,
Australia, Oceania, and most of Asia. The most parsimo-
nious explanation for the geographic distribution of this

private allele is that an ancestral Siberian population mi-
grated across the Bering land bridge in a single wave. This
single migration theory is based on the assumptions that
all copies of the 9-bp allele are identical by descent and
not influenced by selection. Schroeder et al. tested these
underlying assumptions by examining the haplotypic back-
ground in the vicinity of D9S1120 [32]. They observed that
91% of these chromosomes share the same 76.26 kb haplo-
type that they termed “American Modal Haplotype”.
Schroeder et al. suggest that the high frequency and wide-
spread distribution of the 9-repeat alleles are unlikely to be
the result of natural selection [32]. They conclude that all
contemporary Native Americans and Western Beringians
can trace their ancestry to a single founding population.
Recent analyses of genome-wide SNP data suggest
multiple waves of migration from Siberia to the Americas
[33]. The exact number of migrations is difficult to assess
because of the few North American populations analyzed
in this sample (n = 4).  Reich et al. conclude that three
migrations occurred (the same number postulated by
Greenberg et al. [34]), consisting of Amerinds (earliest
migrants), NaDene (Canada and SW United States), and
Aleut/Eskimo (last arrivals) [33]. How can these differ-
ing conclusions be reconciled? One possible scenario is
that multiple migration waves came from the same
Beringian source population. Among Siberian popula-
tions, only the Altai share all of the founding mtDNA
haplogroups A, B, C, D, and X. Yet, these Central Siberian
groups are located more than 1,000 miles from Beringia
with numerous genetically distinct populations located
between the Altai and the region closest to Beringia,
Chukotka. Does the Altai region share common ances-
try with the populations that founded the Americas? An
alternative explanation is that the multiple migrations
were followed by extensive gene flow between the mi-
grant groups, thus, spreading the private allele. A third
possible explanation is that the STR mutation occurred
on the land bridge, followed by gene flow into both the
Americas and Siberia. This ubiquitous mutation is found
in all Native populations of the Americas tested to date,
but in only two contemporary Siberian groups, Chukchi,
located on Chukotka, which is adjacent to Beringia and
Koryaks, located south of Chukotka on the Kamchatkan
peninsula (Figure 3).
DNA sequencing and the reconstruction of
evolutionary history
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, DNA sequencing, which
allows for direct identification of individual or population
fingerprints, was a costly and time-consuming metho-
dology inappropriate for use in population genetics due to
the required sample size. As a result, most of the early
sequencing in anthropological genetics was focused on hy-
pervariable segment-1 of mtDNA, a non-coding region 
that contains considerable genetic variation, approxi-
mately 400 bp in length. However, vast expanses of ge-
nomic DNA were useful for determining the structure and
function of specific genes. High throughput DNA sequen-
cing methodologies and machines have made large sam-
ples from specific populations economically feasible, with
a cost, projected by the National Human Genome Re-
search Center, of $1,000 per genome within the next year
[35]. Sequencing human genomes yields large numbers of
SNPs that can be considered equivalent to fingerprints or
genetic markers.
One application of whole genome sequencing is its
application to questions of admixture and gene flow.
Measures of admixture and gene flow were initially
based on estimates of the frequencies of marker genes
in parental populations and compared to frequencies in
the admixed groups. Earliest attempts to ascertain the
proportions of African and European genes in African
Americans depended on frequencies of Rhesus blood
group Ro 
in an African American population and com-
pared to estimated frequencies of these alleles in West
Africa and Europe [36].  This proportion of admixture
(m) was computed using the Bernstein (1931) formula:
m ¼ qh
–q2
=q1
–q2 
ð1Þ
where, qh 
is the frequency of the allele in the admixed
population; q1 
and q2 
are frequencies of the same allele
in the parental populations [37].
In the 1960s and 1970s, Bernstein’s method for esti-
mating admixture for populations with two ancestral
groups was expanded for populations with three or more
parental groups using parental frequencies and ma-
ximum likelihood, true least squares, or multiple regres-
sion statistical approaches [38]. All of these approaches
suffered from the same weaknesses, i.e., the parental fre-
quencies were rough estimates from populations dating
back centuries before.
Halder et al. developed a panel of ancestry informative
markers (AIMs) consisting of SNPs for estimating indi-
vidual bio-geographical ancestry and admixture. These
are genetic loci with large frequency differences be-
tween ancestral populations allowing them to act as
“prints” or marks of a specific population [39]. They ini-
tially employed 176 autosomal AIMs from four conti-
nents, namely Europeans, West Africans, Indigenous
Americans, and East Asians. This approach for estima-
ting admixture based on AIM SNPs was effectively ap-
plied to two Mexican American samples from San
Antonio, Texas, to determine if their genetic structures
were equivalent [40].  A total of 706 participants from
the San Antonio Family Diabetes Study (SAFDS) were
compared to 586 males from the San Antonio Center
for Biomarkers of Risk of Prostate Cancer (SABOR)
Page 7

Page 7 of 10
using 64 ancestry informative markers. Significant ge-
netic differences in population structure were observed in
the ancestral proportions of the two samples of Mexican
Americans from San Antonio. The SAFDS sample exhib-
ited 50.2 ± 0.6% European admixture, while the SABOR
sample had 58.9 ± 0.7%. Similar differences were observed
using this method for estimating Native American propor-
tions, SAFDS 46.4 ± 0.6% versus SABOR 38.2 ± 0.7%. The
West African admixture was estimated at 3.1 ± 0.2%
for the SAFDS sample and 2.9 ± 0.2% for the SABOR
Mexican American samples from San Antonio. These
AIM (SNP) methodologies are considerably more ro-
bust and provide more informative estimates of admix-
ture than standard genetic markers, mtDNA, or NRY
haplotypes in subpopulations.
Because of high throughput sequencing and the
characterization of entire genomes, Johnson et al. have
been able to reconstruct the history of admixed popula-
tions using DNA recombination to parse out the more
specific geographical sources of the parental populations
[41]. The shorter chromosomal segments reflect a longer
evolutionary history because they have had more time to
recombine with unrelated DNA; the longer chromosomal
segments reflect a more recent admixture. By comparing
DNA segments from one ancestral population (either
European, African, or Native American) with admixed
groups, greater accuracy can be obtained about the origin
of the parental groups and the sizes of the source of the
gene flow. They found that the European contribution to
the Latino population came from Spain and Portugal and
had a low genetic diversity, indicating that few individuals
contributed to the admixed population [42].
Among the projects underway to better understand
genome wide diversity is the 1000 Genomes Project,
which is currently sequencing 2,500 genomes from indi-
viduals from all over the world in an attempt to reveal
the extent of the diversity contained in the human spe-
cies and determine how this genetic diversity translates
into specific phenotypes [43]. This project has identified
several hundred thousand SNPs that vary in allelic fre-
quencies by population, exposing potential variants that
will allow us to better define and reconstruct the human
diaspora, provide a better understanding of ancestry at
both the individual and population level, and allow us to
better tell the story of both ancient and recent admix-
ture. These data will initiate a new era of anthropological
genetics and will further shift the definition of what
constitutes a genetic marker or DNA fingerprint.
Ancient DNA (whole genome)
The last decade has also seen an emergence of technology
that has allowed for investigation of ancient genomes be-
yond mtDNA, traditionally a focus in ancient molecular
studies because of the abundance of mitochondria in 
skeletal remains. These advances have included the
sequencing of entire genomes of ancient remains of
Neandertals and a hominin group from Siberia, called
Denisovans, that were identified by their unique ge-
netic characteristics [44,45]. These studies have shown
that we shared a common ancestor with Neandertals
and Denisovans some 800,000 years ago [45],  that
Neandertals have contributed more genes to non-
African populations than African populations [46], and
that Denisovans have contributed to the genomes of
Melanesians, Australian aborigines, and Southeast Asians
[45]. Studies of both groups of ancient hominins have also
unraveled functional genes. For example, Neandertal re-
mains from various sites indicate the presence of type O
blood [47],  alleles that may be associated with red hair
and fair skin [48], and the ability to taste the bitter che-
mical phenylthiocarbamide [49]. Genetic variants of the
Denisovan individual suggest the presence of dark skin,
hair, and eyes [45]. These advances have allowed us to
look further back into our evolutionary history and
allow us to better refine our knowledge of how, when
and why we have come to be.
In anthropology, whole genome studies of ancient indi-
viduals have also been used to answer questions regarding
the peopling of the Americas. A human hair tuft, exca-
vated in 1986 at Qeqertasussuk, a Saqqaq archeological
site from West Greenland, was rediscovered in a museum
in Copenhagen. Because of the permafrost conditions,
there was excellent preservation of both mitochondrial
and genomic DNA. The whole mtDNA genome was first
sequenced from this Paleo-Eskimo, dating back 4,000 to
5,000 years B.P. [50]. The mtDNA haplogroup (D2a1) de-
tected in this Paleo-Eskimo is distinct from modern Native
Americans and Neo-Eskimos but is identical to the hap-
logroup observed in contemporary Aleuts of the Archipel-
ago [50]. This analysis raised questions about a potential
early migration of Siberians who expanded into Greenland
prior to the later Thule Eskimo expansion.
Rasmussen et al. sequenced the whole genome of the
Paleo-Eskimo and recovered 353,151 high confidence SNPs
[51]. This Saqqaq genome clusters with Asian populations
instead of the contemporary Eskimo or Native American
populations. The maternal discontinuity first described by
Gilbert et al. was further verified through whole genomic
sequencing [50].
Because of the identification of the vast array of SNPs
in the Saqqaq genome, it was possible to identify the
functional SNPs in this 4,000 year old Paleo-Eskimo.
Rasmussen et al. utilized the observed SNPs to recon-
struct the following phenotypes of Saqqaq man: blood
group subtype A1, Q1 NRY haplogroup, brown eyes, non-
European light skin, increased risk of baldness, higher
body mass index, dry cerumen, shovel-shaped incisors,
and a metabolism that was adapted to a cold environment

[51]. These phenotypes were deduced from their associa-
tions to SNPs, such as a single base deletion in a transfe-
rase gene that results in an additional domain at the
carboxyl terminal and an A1 phenotype [52]. Similarly, the
presence of a non-synonymous variant (C/C) in the TP53
on chromosome 17, suggested that Saqqaq man possessed
a more active form of p53 by coding for an Arg variant
which is related to the more effective regulation of metab-
olism in cold climates [53]. Similar functional associations
may yield future information about the evolution of com-
plex diseases and the genetic predispositions for chronic
conditions, such as heart disease or breast cancer, in
contemporary and ancient populations.
Future
With the rapid changes in technology and data analyses,
DNA genetic markers will play a significant role in future
anthropological genetics. Whole genome sequencing is go-
ing to become cheaper and faster. The main hurdle for
scientists will be the analysis of immense data sets (mil-
lions of nucleotides) that are being generated by massive
sequencing programs. Within anthropological genetics,
these developments are going to mean improvements in
the use of molecular data in forensics (with less reliance
on more subjective morphological techniques),  genetic
epidemiology, and population genetics. Greater emphasis
can then be placed on unraveling the cultural and environ-
mental factors that shape the expression of our genomes.
Anthropological geneticists investigating disease associa-
tions and adaptation have long worked toward uncovering
the genetic variation that leads to disease and disease sus-
ceptibility. These attempts have, over the past decade, ge-
nerally been performed using genome wide association
studies that have identified some common variants that
can lead to, or provide protection from, pathology. How-
ever, many of these diseases and disorders may be caused
by rare variants that do not give a strong enough signal
for identification (see Gibson, 2012 for a review [54]). The
1000 Genomes Project may rectify some of these short-
comings as it aims to identify variants that are found at a
frequency of 1% compared to the frequency of common
variants used in genome-wide association studies that are
found at roughly 5%. Furthermore, whole genome sequen-
cing will reveal rare variants that lie farther from the block
of linkage disequilibrium that may also influence the
disease pathway. These data will only expand as more stu-
dies involve the use of whole genome sequences towards a
better understanding of disease.
Future studies of admixed populations will be based on
whole genomic sequencing, the effects of recombination,
linkage disequilibrium and the use of panels of ancestry
informative markers. In the past, the effects of natural se-
lection on admixture estimates could only be examined
using imprecise approaches such as the examination, locus 
by locus, of deviations from expectation under a specific
gene flow model. Through the use of whole genomic se-
quencing, regions of the genome can be examined for the
signature of selection in both modern and ancient popula-
tions. In addition, rare alleles found only in specific groups
should allow for a more detailed picture of human history
and better define the complicated ways in which humans
interact with one another and the environment.
In the 1980s, Sir Alec Jeffreys first pioneered DNA finger-
prints as a means of identifying individuals. Since that time
many more genetic markers and polymorphisms have been
developed to identify unknown individuals of forensic inter-
est. Now, an individual’s entire genome can be considered a
DNA fingerprint, but its size, and the computational power
necessary for analysis, makes its use in forensics inefficient
and costly. The changing technology has resulted in the
discovery of many more genetic markers (mtDNA, NRY,
autosomal STRs, and SNPs) that are better suited for foren-
sic and anthropological analyses, as well as cheaper and fas-
ter ways of achieving these analyses.
The future application of genetic markers (DNA fin-
gerprints) is wide open and the next decade of research
will lead to a better understanding of the origins and
evolution of our species. It is unclear how far back in
time studies of ancient DNA will take us, but these new
methodologies will provide anthropologists with a re-
fined story of human history, unraveling the complex-
ities of human migration, admixture, and the successful
and unsuccessful ways in which hominin genomes were
selected by their environment. We are in the initial
stages of personalized medicine in which our familial
genomic endowment will determine specific treatments.
We envisage a future where genetic information, a fin-
gerprint of an individual’s genome, will be readily avail-
able and utilized for the assessment of ancestry, health
risks and the treatment of disease, and crimes will be
solved by comparisons of DNA from individuals of inter-
est in particular cases with huge DNA data bases. When
Sir Alec Jeffreys first began his work using fingerprints
to identify individuals for forensic purposes, it opened a
door to research that has allowed a better understanding
of who we are both as individuals and as a species.
