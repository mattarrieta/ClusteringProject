Abstract
Over the past 5 years there has been a marked increase in the use
of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast. Multiple
research studies have confirmed improved cancer detection,
diagnosis, and evaluation of response to therapy with breast MRI
compared with mammography and ultrasound. As this exciting new
technology advances, focused work in optimal scan protocols,
appropriate clinical applications, and image interpretation are
needed. Both the potential benefits and harms need to be
evaluated to guide optimal use of this imaging modality in select
patient populations.
History of magnetic resonance imaging of the
breast
Some of the first images of the body produced with magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) were of the breast [1]. However, by
the mid-1980s most investigators had concluded that there
was little clinical utility for MRI in detecting or diagnosing
breast cancer. The application of contrast agents to breast
imaging, first published by Heywang and colleagues [2],
changed that thinking and revealed that breast cancers, in
comparison with normal breast tissue, were enhanced
significantly with standard gadolinium contrast agents.
Heywang’s reports were followed closely by those of Kaiser
and Zeitler [3], who also found contrast-enhanced magnetic
resonance images useful in breast cancer diagnosis but by
using a very different technique. Whereas Heywang and
colleagues acquired one pre-contrast and two post-contrast
sequences of a single breast, permitting high spatial
resolution with a three-dimensional gradient echo technique,
Kaiser and Zeitler obtained one pre-contrast and multiple
post-contrast images of both breasts, permitting high
temporal resolution.
This work by Heywang and Kaiser in the 1980s established
that contrast-enhanced MRI could distinguish benign from
malignant breast tissue; additional reports, including those by
Harms and Kuhl in the 1990s [4,5],  contributed to our 
understanding of the optimal methods of image acquisition.
Two basic camps were established, one focusing on the
rapid acquisition of images of both breasts after contrast
injection (high temporal resolution of the ‘dynamic’ school)
and the other focusing on three-dimensional gradient echo
imaging with thin slices through one breast (high spatial
resolution of the ‘static’ school). The dynamic school tended
to use image subtraction to suppress the high signal from fat,
whereas the static school tended to eliminate the fat signal by
more time-consuming methods of suppression. The dynamic
school, more popular in Europe, helped to develop methods
to evaluate various enhancement profiles over time, and the
static school, more popular in the USA, helped to develop
methods to distinguish morphologic features of malignant
and benign lesions [6]. By 2000, most agreed that both high
temporal and high spatial resolution were important in gaining
information about both the pharmacokinetics and morphology
of breast lesions. Importantly, current technology permits
acquisition protocols that provide both high spatial resolution
(≤3mm slices with ≤1mm in-plane spatial resolution) and
high temporal resolution (fat-suppressed T
1 
acquisitions
covering both breasts in ≤2 min).
Breast MRI acquisition techniques
There are numerous acceptable methods of image
acquisition, and no single method has proven superior to
another. However, there are guidelines considered by most
experts to be reasonable minimum requirements for achieving
acceptable image quality.
A dedicated breast surface coil should always be used. Both
unilateral and bilateral coils are available. Bilateral imaging
has obvious advantages of cost, time, and patient
convenience. Most coils sold today are for bilateral imaging
and most are open, allowing for access to the breast tissue
for MRI-guided interventions. The vast majority of published
studies of breast MRI have been conducted on 1.5T
magnets, but there are some reports from 1.0 T scanners.

In 2003, the 4th edition of the manual for the American College
of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-
RADS®) included a section dedicated to the performance and
reporting of breast MRI [7]. The committee acknowledged that
no single method of image acquisition had been proven
superior to others, but that reporting of breast MRI should
include field strength, pre-contrast and post-contrast
sequences used, method of fat suppression, and post-
processing performed (subtractions, axial, sagittal, coronal
reconstructions, and/or maximum intensity projections).
Breast MR image interpretation
The American College of Radiology BI-RADS MRI lexicon for
breast imaging includes detailed language for describing
morphology and kinetics of lesions. All suspicious enhancing
areas should be described as a focus or foci, mass or non-
mass-like enhancement. Foci are typically less than 5mm in
diameter, whereas masses have defined convex margins. All
mass descriptions should include reporting of mass shape,
margin and internal enhancement. Non-mass-like
enhancement descriptions should include distribution,
internal enhancement and symmetry. Associated findings
(such as edema, adenopathy, cysts, and skin or chest wall
involvement) should be reported and kinetic curve
assessment of all lesions described. Kinetic curve
assessment should include initial peak enhancement (slow,
medium, or rapid) and delayed-phase (persistent, plateau, or
washout) analyses.
Clinical applications of breast MRI
Numerous reports evaluating the potential role of breast MRI
in defined patient populations have been published. These
studies cover the spectrum of cancer detection, diagnosis,
and response to treatment evaluation, and include women
with a mammographic or palpable abnormality, axillary
adenopathy but unknown primary, current cancer diagnosis,
and women at high risk for breast cancer.
Further evaluation of mammographic or palpable
abnormality
Initially, clinical studies of breast MRI focused on the potential
role of MRI in further evaluation of a mammographic or
palpable lesion. It was proposed that MRI could reduce the
number of unnecessary biopsies recommended from
traditional work-ups of mammographic or palpable lesions.
However, although MRI was shown to have very high
sensitivity it was not 100% sensitive and it demonstrated only
moderate specificity. In 2004 the International Breast MRI
Consortium published the largest (n = 821) multicenter study
so far of patients recommended for biopsy based on
abnormal mammogram, ultrasound, or clinical breast exam
[8]. This study demonstrated that although MRI had very high
sensitivity, 12% of cancers identified by mammography or
clinical breast exam were negative on MRI. The authors
concluded that MRI should not be used to overrule a
216 recommendation for biopsy. It was also interesting that the 
use of dynamic MRI in this patient population did not improve
accuracy compared with high-spatial-resolution three-
dimensional MRI alone.
Evaluation of extent of disease
Although negative or benign MRI findings cannot replace a
recommendation for biopsy based on traditional methods,
MRI does seem to be important in the assessment of extent
of disease in patients with a recent diagnosis of breast
cancer. This application was pioneered by Harms and
colleagues [9] and confirmed by multiple reports over the
past 15years including that by Bedrosian and colleagues
[10], all demonstrating that MRI can identify otherwise occult
multicentric and multifocal disease in women with breast
cancer. Harms compared results from in vivo MR images with
serially sectioned pathologic analyses in 30 mastectomy
specimens. MRI detected additional disease in 37% of
specimens. Several subsequent reports confirmed the
findings of Harms and colleagues, including a report from the
University of Pennsylvania [11] that MRI changed manage-
ment of 23% of patients scheduled for breast conserving
therapy. In the largest multisite study so far, the International
Breast MRI Consortium reported on 426 women with a current
cancer diagnosis. MRI identified additional disease at least
2 cm from the index malignant lesion in 18% of patients [12].
The advantage of MRI in determining the extent of disease
has also been demonstrated in studies evaluating the
contralateral breast. In a recent study of 239 women with a
breast cancer diagnosis who underwent prophylactic
contralateral mastectomy (no known disease in the
contralateral breast), 4.6% of women had cancer identified by
pathology [13]. Interestingly, seven clinical studies of women
with a recent cancer diagnosis have found that, on average,
4% of women will have otherwise occult contralateral
cancers identified by MRI at the time of the initial breast
cancer diagnosis [14].  These data suggest that most
contralateral cancers can be detected at the time of the initial
breast cancer diagnosis (Fig. 1).
Malignant adenopathy, unknown primary
A small percentage (1 to 2%) of breast cancer patients
present with axillary adenopathy, unknown primary. Current
treatment recommendations for these patients is mastectomy.
However, MRI will detect the occult cancer in 75 to 85% of
patients, allowing many of these to have lumpectomy rather
than mastectomy [15].
Evaluation of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy
In the mid-1990s, Gilles and colleagues [16] reported that
MRI was superior to mammography and clinical breast exam
in evaluating response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Subsequent studies supported these findings but cautioned
that the false negative rate of MRI is increased after
chemotherapy and MRI cannot exclude microscopic disease
[17,18].

Pathology proved infiltrating ductal carcinoma.
Screening women at high risk for breast cancer
Although all women are at risk for developing breast cancer,
there are subgroups of women who can be identified by
genetic testing or by risk modeling who are at significantly
increased risk for breast cancer. For example, women who
are carriers of the BRCA1 mutation have an approximately
85% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. In addition,
women at increased risk tend to develop breast cancer at a
younger age when mammography is less sensitive, probably
because of increased mammographic density and increased
growth rates of tumors in women of younger age (Fig. 2).
Multiple studies published since 2000 demonstrate that
screening MRI can detect otherwise occult breast cancers in 
women at high risk (Table1) [19-25].  The first study
published on screening MRI in high-risk women was by Kuhl
and colleagues [19],  who screened 192 women with
mammography, MRI, and ultrasound. In that study, MRI
detected 6 cancers in 192 women (3%) that were occult on
both mammography and ultrasound. The largest screening
MRI study so far [24] reported on 1,909 women at increased
risk in the Netherlands, with 51 women diagnosed with
cancer. The sensitivities of clinical breast examination,
mammography, and MRI were 17.9%,  33%,  and 79.5%,
respectively. The overall discriminating capacity of MRI was
significantly better than mammography as assessed by
receiver operator curves (area under the curve: 0.83 for MRI
versus 0.69 for mammography).  217

Although in all studies so far MRI sensitivity has been
uniformly high, the specificity and positive predictive value of
biopsies vary widely. The rates of biopsies performed in
women undergoing screening MRI have ranged from 2.9% to
16%, with positive predictive value of those biopsies ranging
from 17% to 89%. It is interesting that MRI specificity seems
to improve after the first round of screening. Warner and
colleagues [20] reported recall rates decreasing during the
first, second and third rounds of MRI screening from 17% to
10% to 7%.
MRI has not been studied in the general population as a
screening tool, and the results from MRI screening of high-
risk women may not apply to women at average risk. The high
cost of MRI (about 10 times the cost of mammography) and
its variable specificity currently prohibit its routine use for
screening general populations.
Two specific populations of women are considered to have
relative contraindications to contrast-enhanced MRI:
pregnant and nursing women. Other than early animal studies
showing adverse effects on embryo development, there is
little information about the risks of contrast-enhanced imaging
during pregnancy. Little is also known about the transfer and
effects of this agent on nursing infants. Makers of the agent
gadodiamide (Omniscan; Amersham Health) identify it as a
Category C drug and recommend caution in its use in these
two specific populations, noting that contrast-enhanced
imaging should be conducted on pregnant women only when
the benefits of the exam are considered to outweigh the risks
to the fetus. For nursing mothers, the current recommendation
is to wait 24 hours after injection before resuming nursing.
Conclusion
The use of breast MRI is increasing rapidly as this exciting
technology improves and as data continue to become
available supporting the value of this tool in select patient
populations. Breast MRI is highly sensitive, with an
acceptable specificity compared with other imaging
modalities. Although MRI clearly detects cancers occult to
mammography, ultrasound, and clinical breast exam, the
impact of MRI on breast cancer recurrence or mortality has
not been studied. Analyses of cost-effectiveness of MRI in
distinct patient populations need to be performed. There is
significant work to be done to optimize the application and
performance of breast MRI. Research to clarify optimal
acquisition protocols is needed. Recent work in breast MRI in
3T magnets is very exciting and holds promise for even
higher spatial and temporal resolution by providing a better
signal : noise ratio. MRI spectroscopy, reviewed in another
article in this series [26], may improve the specificity of MRI
and might possibly predict the response to therapy and/or
evaluate the very early response to chemotherapy. Novel
contrast agents are being developed that may provide more
sensitive and more specific discrimination of benign from
218  malignant lesions. These rapidly advancing areas of research
