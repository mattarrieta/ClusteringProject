Abstract
Diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) and diffuse optical imaging
(DOI) are non-invasive diagnostic techniques that employ near-
infrared (NIR) light to quantitatively characterize the optical
properties of centimeter-thick, multiple-scattering tissues. Although
NIR was first applied to breast diaphanography more than 70 years
ago, quantitative optical methods employing time- or frequency-
domain ‘photon migration’ technologies have only recently been
used for breast imaging. Because their performance is not limited
by mammographic density, optical methods can provide new
insight regarding tissue functional changes associated with the
appearance, progression, and treatment of breast cancer,
particularly for younger women and high-risk subjects who may not
benefit from conventional imaging methods. This paper reviews the
principles of diffuse optics and describes the development of
broadband DOS for quantitatively measuring the optical and
physiological properties of thick tissues. Clinical results are shown
highlighting the sensitivity of diffuse optics to malignant breast
tumors in 12 pre-menopausal subjects ranging in age from 30 to
39years and a patient undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy for
locally advanced breast cancer. Significant contrast was observed
between normal and tumor regions of tissue for deoxy-hemoglobin
(p= 0.005),  oxy-hemoglobin (p= 0.002),  water (p= 0.014),  and
lipids (p = 0.0003). Tissue hemoglobin saturation was not found to
be a reliable parameter for distinguishing between tumor and
normal tissues. Optical data were converted into a tissue optical
index that decreased 50% within 1week in response to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These results suggest a potential role
for diffuse optics as a bedside monitoring tool that could aid the
development of new strategies for individualized patient care. 
Introduction
Although mammography is the primary clinical imaging
modality used to detect breast cancer, limitations in both
sensitivity and specificity, particularly in younger and high-risk
women, have led to the development of alternative
techniques. Overall, mammography has reduced sensitivity in
pre-menopausal women [1] and is not clinically advantageous
for women under 35years of age [2]. A general consensus
has emerged that mammography is not recommended for
women less than 40years of age, and in the 40 to 50year
old population there is uncertainly regarding its effectiveness.
Additional complications arise due to the fact that in pre-
menopausal women,  mammographic density and false
negative rates are greater during the luteal versus follicular
phase of the menstrual cycle [3]. Similarly, the use of hormone
replacement therapy in post-menopausal women is known to
increase mammographic density [4] and has been shown to
impede the effectiveness of mammographic screening [5,6].
In practical terms, up to 10% of all breast cancers, roughly
20,000 cases per year in the US, are not discovered by X-ray
mammography [7]. Consequently, new detection technologies
are needed that can overcome the limitations of high
radiographic density.
The use of near infrared (NIR) optical methods as a
supplement to conventional techniques for diagnosing and
detecting breast cancer has generated considerable interest.
Optical methods are advantageous because they are non-
invasive, fast, relatively inexpensive, pose no risk of ionizing
radiation, and NIR light can easily penetrate centimeter-thick

tissues. Several groups have employed optical methods to
measure subtle physiological differences in healthy breast
tissue [8-13],  to detect tumors [14-22], and to measure
tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [23-25].
Differences in optical signatures between tissues are
manifestations of multiple physiological changes associated
with factors such as vascularization, cellularity, oxygen
consumption, edema, fibrosis, and remodeling.
The primary limitation of optical methods is related to the fact
that multiple-scattering dominates NIR light propagation in
thick tissues, making quantitative measurements of optical
coherence impossible. In this ‘diffusion regime’,  light
transport can be modeled as a diffusive process where
photons behave as stochastic particles that move in
proportion to a gradient, much like the bulk movement of
molecules or heat. Quantitative tissue properties can only be
obtained by separating light absorption from scattering,
typically by using time- or frequency-domain measurements
and model-based computations [26-29].  The underlying
physical principle of these ‘photon migration’ methods is
based on the fact that the probability of light absorption (i.e.
molecular interactions) is 50 to 100-fold lower than light
scattering due to dramatic differences in tissue scattering
versus absorption lengths [30,31].
Quantitative diffuse optical methods can be used in breast
diagnostics to form images (diffuse optical imaging (DOI))
and obtain spectra (diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS)). DOI
and DOS are conceptually similar to the relationship between
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance
spectroscopy. In general, DOI is used to form images of
subsurface structures by combining data from a large number
of source-detector ‘views’ (i.e. in planar or circular transmission
geometry) using inverse tomographic reconstruction
techniques [32].  DOI typically utilizes a limited number of
optical wavelengths (e.g., two to six) and a narrow temporal
bandwidth. In contrast, DOS employs a limited number of
source-detector positions (e.g.,  one to two) but employs
broadband content in temporal and spectral domains (i.e.,
hundreds of wavelengths) to recover complete absorption
and scattering spectra from approximately 650 to 1,000nm.
Although an ideal DOI design would employ hundreds or
thousands of source-detector pairs and wavelengths, several
engineering considerations related to measurement time
currently limit the practicality of this approach.
A substantial body of work has emerged over the past
decade that demonstrates how tomographically based DOI
methods can accurately localize subsurface structures.
Optimal clinical decision-making, however, requires under-
standing the precise biochemical composition or ‘fingerprint’
of these localized inhomogeneities. This information can be
obtained by fully characterizing the spectral content of breast
tumors using quantitative DOS. DOS signatures are used to
280 measure tissue hemoglobin concentration (total, oxy-,  and 
deoxy- forms),  tissue hemoglobin oxygen saturation (oxy-
hemoglobin relative to the total hemoglobin), water content,
lipid content and tissue scattering. Several research groups
have demonstrated the sensitivity of these tissue components
to breast physiology and disease [8,10,11,33].  Critical
challenges remain to determine the precise relationship
between these quantitative measures and cancer.
Consequently, this paper reviews our efforts to determine
tumor biochemical composition from low-resolution spatial
maps of broadband absorption and scattering spectra.
To minimize partial volume sampling effects and attribute our
signals specifically to breast tumors despite high
mammographic density, we have studied 12 pre-menopausal
30 to 39year old subjects with locally advanced, stage III
invasive disease, focusing on the question, “what do tumors
‘look’ like?” Because the biological processes that determine
the origins of optical contrast are conserved across spatial
scales, intrinsic optical signals measured from these subjects
are expected to be similar for earlier stage disease. We
highlight this population because conventional methods are
generally considered to be ineffective in younger women. We
also present results of DOS measurements during
neoadjuvant chemotherapy to demonstrate the sensitivity of
optics to physiological perturbations within one week of
treatment. Thus, these studies provide critical information
regarding the spectral content of DOI necessary for clinical
applications, such as early cancer detection, distinguishing
between malignant and benign tumors, and monitoring the
effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Materials and methods
Broadband DOS measurements were made with the laser
breast scanner (Fig. 1a).  The laser breast scanner is a
bedside-capable system that combines frequency-domain
photon migration with steady-state tissue spectroscopy to
measure complete (broadband) NIR absorption and reduced
scattering spectra of breast tissue in vivo. Detailed
descriptions of the instrumentation and theory have been
provided elsewhere [34-36].
DOS measurements are made by placing the hand-held
probe (Fig. 1b) on the tissue surface and moving the probe to
discrete locations along a line at 1.0cm intervals. This forms
a linescan across the lesion and surrounding normal tissue
(Fig. 2a). The number of DOS positions varies depending on
the lesion size. For comparison, a linescan is also performed
at an identical location on the contralateral breast. Two
measurements are made in each location and all
measurement positions are marked on the skin with a surgical
pen. The average laser optical power launched into the tissue
is about 10 to 20mW and the total measurement time to
generate complete NIR absorption and scattering spectra
from a single position is typically about 30seconds. A
complete DOS study including calibration time is
approximately 30 to 45 minutes.

The handheld probe was moved along a linear grid of steps spaced 10 mm apart. Both the tumor region (which had been previously identified) as
well as the contra-lateral normal side were measured. Note that the orientation, location, and number of points of the linescan varied with the
clinical presentation of the lesion. In (b) we demonstrate the diffusive nature of near infrared photons in tissue.
The probe source and detector separation is 28mm, from
which we estimate a mean penetration depth of approxi-
mately 10mm in the tissue. The actual tissue volume
interrogated, which is determined by multiple light
scattering and absorption (Fig. 2b),  extends above and
below the mean penetration depth and is estimated to
approximately 10 cm3.
Laser breast scanner measurements produce complete
absorption and reduced scattering spectra across the NIR
(650 to 1,000 nm) at each probe position. From the absorption
spectrum, quantitative tissue concentration measurements of
oxygenated hemoglobin (ctO
2
Hb), deoxygenated hemoglobin
(ctHHb),  water (ctH
2
O),  and lipid are calculated [8].  From 
these parameters total tissue hemoglobin concentration
(ctTHb= ctO
2
Hb+ ctHHb) and tissue hemoglobin oxygenation
saturation (stO
2 
= ctO
2
Hb/ctTHb× 100%) are calculated. A
tissue optical index (TOI) was developed as a contrast
function by combining DOS measurements; TOI= ctHHb×
ctH
2
O/(%lipid). The parameters of this contrast function were
determined from an evaluation of DOS measurements in a
larger population of 58 malignant breast lesions [37]. Spatial
variations in TOI allow us to rapidly locate the maximum lesion
optical contrast. Tissue scattering is reported by the results
of a power law fit of the form scattering = Aλ–SP, where λ is
the optical wavelength and SP is scatter power [38,39]. Data
were analyzed with custom software developed in Matlab
(MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA).  281

Results and discussion
Tumor properties in pre-menopausal subjects
To determine the sensitivity of optics to breast cancer in
younger women, a series of broadband DOS measurements
were performed prior to surgical biopsy on 12 patients
(13malignant breast tumors) whose average age was
35.3± 3.6 years, with a range of 30 to 39years. The
average body-mass index was 24.5± 4.3, with a range of
20.1 to 32.6. The linescan location (Fig. 2) was chosen
based upon a priori knowledge of the tumor location from
palpation, ultrasound, or X-ray mammography; thus, the intent
of this data was not to screen for suspicious lesions but to
characterize malignant lesion optical properties. Linescans
were performed with 10mm steps and a source-detector
separation of 28mm. Measurements were repeated twice to
evaluate placement errors at each location on the grid. The
average tumor size was 35± 27mm, with a range of 9 to
110mm, and the average Bloom-Richardson score was
6.4± 1.4, with a range of 4 to 9. All tumor classifications
were determined by standard clinical pathology.
Figure3 shows average spectra from 12 subjects for normal
breast and peak tumor measurements. Clear differences in
shape and amplitude of spectral features are visible
throughout the 650 to 1,000nm region. The error bars for
each spectrum represent the standard error of the mean for
each of the populations (13 spectra from 12 patients).
Spectra obtained from each tumor measurement were used
to calculate physiological properties, summarized in Table1.
We performed non-parametric standard tests for significance
for these values (Wilcoxon Ranked-sum test, two-sided, 95%
confidence). The results of the analysis show that the basis
chromophores, ctHHb, ctO
2
Hb, ctH
2
O, %lipid, and scatter
power (or the exponent of the scattering spectrum power
law) all display statistically significant differences between
normal and tumor tissue. Mean tumor levels of ctHHb,
ctO
2
Hb, and ctH
2
O are nearly two-fold greater than normal;
tumor %lipid is reduced by approximately 45%, and scatter
power increases by about 40% in tumors. Table2
summarizes the contrast between tumor and normal tissue for
the calculated indices ctTHb, stO
2
,  and TOI as defined
above. Mean ctTHb, an index of angiogenesis, is
approximately two-fold greater for tumors versus normal
tissue. TOI, a composite contrast index that reflects both
cellular and stromal components, shows a nearly 10-fold
contrast between tumors and normal tissue, although with
high variability. Both ctTHb and TOI are significantly greater
for tumors versus normal tissue, while stO
2
, an index of tissue
oxygen consumption, is, on average, slightly lower in tumors
but not significantly different from normal tissue. We note that
stO
2 
does not appear to be a good index for discriminating
between malignant and normal tissues in this patient
population (ages 30 to 39 years).
Tumor tissue displays increased absorption in the 650 to
282 850nm spectral range, corresponding to elevated ctTHb. 
Figure 3
Averaged absorption spectra from 13 tumors in 12 patients aged from
30 to 39 years. The tumor spectra clearly demonstrate different
spectral features from the normal tissue. The increased absorption in
the 650 to 850 nm region is indicative of increased oxy- and deoxy-
hemoglobin concentration. The increased absorption in the 950 to
1,000 nm region is indicative of increased tissue water concentration.
Normal tissue lipid contrast is evident in the 900 to 950 nm region
(Tables 1 and 2). Error bars represent the standard error of the mean
for the given population, shown every 20 nm.
Additional contrast features appear from 900 to 1,000nm
due to variations in water and lipid composition. High ctTHb
corresponds to elevated tissue blood volume fraction and
angiogenesis; high ctH
2
O suggests edema and increased
cellularity; decreased lipid content reflects displacement of
parenchymal adipose, and decreased stO
2 
indicates tissue
hypoxia driven by metabolically active tumor cells. Tumor
tissue can also have higher scattering values and a larger
scatter power than normal tissue. The physiological
interpretation of this observation is that tumors are composed
of smaller scattering particles, most likely due to their high
epithelial and collagen content, compared to surrounding
normal tissue. These changes can be grouped together to
enhance contrast through the formation of the TOI, where
elevated TOI values suggest high metabolic activity and
malignancy [40]. We are currently exploring the development
of additional TOI functions that can be derived from base
parameters in order to optimize measurement sensitivity to
factors such as cellular metabolism, extracellular matrix, and
angiogenesis.
Monitoring neoadjuvant chemotherapy
Figure4a shows a TOI linescan obtained from the right
breast of a 48year old pre-menopausal patient with a 4.0 by
2.5 by 2.5 cm invasive ductal carcinoma (determined by MRI).
The TOI peak contrast is approximately three-fold greater for
the tumor versus normal tissue. The tumor spatial extent
mapped by the DOS linescan is in good agreement with MRI

neoadjuvant chemotherapy. TOI values in Fig. 4b were
determined by averaging the three peak levels in each
linescan (positions 4, 5, 6) with error bars as for Fig. 4a.
Measurements prior to and on days 1, 2, 3, 6 and 8 following
therapy are shown. Note the dramatic drop in TOI from 2.5
prior to therapy to 1.7, a 30% drop in only 1day. By day 8,
peak TOI levels (1.0) were approximately equal to normal
baseline (0.8),  representing a 60% reduction in 1week.
These results are due to a 30% reduction in ctTHb and
ctH
2
O, and a 20% increase in lipid at the tumor. They are
comparable to our previous report of 20% to 30% changes in
ctTHb, ctH
2
O, and %lipid for a neoadjuvant chemotherapy
responder during the first week [23].  We are currently
expanding our study population in order to capture a
sufficient number of non-, partial-, and complete responders
(determined by pathology) to evaluate whether these three
cases can be distinguished. In this manner, we expect to use
DOS to provide rapid, bedside feedback for monitoring and
predicting therapeutic response.
Conclusion
Tumor and normal breast tissues displayed significant
differences in ctHHb (p= 0.005),  ctO
2
Hb (p= 0.002),
ctH
2
O (p = 0.014), and lipids (p = 0.0003) in a population of
12 women aged from 30 to 39years. These physiological
data were assembled into a TOI to enhance the functional
contrast between malignant and normal tissues; however,
stO
2 
was not found to be a reliable index in this regard. A
50% decrease in TOI was measured within 1week for a
patient undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
DOS and DOI are relatively inexpensive technologies that do
not require compression, are intrinsically sensitive to the
principal components of breast tissue, and are compatible
with the use of exogenous molecular probes. DOS is easily
integrated into conventional imaging approaches such as
MRI, ultrasound, and mammography; and performance is not
compromised by structural changes that impact breast
density. As a result, diffuse optics may be advantageous for
populations with dense breasts, such as younger women,
high-risk subjects, and women receiving hormone replace-
ment therapy. Because NIR light is non-ionizing, DOI can be
used to monitor physiological changes on a frequent basis
without exposing the tissue to potentially harmful radiation.
Finally, because DOS can be used to quantitatively assess
tumor biochemical composition, it can be applied to
monitoring tumor response to therapy. Because these
changes occur predominantly early in the course of
treatment, we anticipate that diffuse optics will play an
important role in minimizing toxicity, predicting responders
early in the course of therapy, and developing ‘real time’
strategies for individualized patient care.
