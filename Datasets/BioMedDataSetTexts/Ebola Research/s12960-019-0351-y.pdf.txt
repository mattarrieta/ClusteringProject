Abstract
Background: The 2013–2014 West African Ebola outbreak highlighted how the world’s weakest health systems threaten
global health security and heralded huge support for their recovery. All three Ebola-affected countries had large shortfalls
and maldistribution in their health workforce before the crisis, which were made worse by the epidemic. This paper
analyzes the investment plans in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea to strengthen their health workforces and assesses their
potential contribution to the re-establishment and strengthening of their health systems. The analysis calculates the plans’
costs and compares those to likely fiscal space, to assess feasibility.
Methods: Public sector payroll data from 2015 from each country was used for the workforce analysis and does not
include the private sector. Data were coded into the major cadres defined by the International Standard Classification of
Occupations (ISCO-88). We estimated health worker training numbers and costs to meet international health worker
density targets in the future and used sensitivity analysis to model hypothetical alternate estimates of attrition, drop-outs,
and employment rates.
Results: Health worker-to-population density targets per 1000 population for doctors, nurses, and midwives are only
specified in Liberia (1.12) and Guinea’s (0.78) investment plans and fall far short of the regional average for Africa (1.33) or
international benchmarks of 2.5 per 1000 population and 4.45 for universal health coverage. Even these modest targets
translate into substantial scaling-up requirements with Liberia having to almost double, Guinea quadruple, and Sierra
Leone having to increase its workforce by seven to tenfold to achieve Liberia and Guinea’s targets. Costs per capita to
meet the 2.5 per 1000 population density targets with 5% attrition, 10% drop-out, and 75% employment rate range from
US$4.2 in Guinea to US$7.9 in Liberia in 2029, with projected fiscal space being adequate to accommodate the proposed
scaling-up targets in both countries.
Conclusions: Achieving even a modest scale-up of health workforce will require a steady growth in health budgets, a
long-term horizon and substantial scale-up of current training institution capacity. Increasing value-for-money in health
workforce investments will require more efficient geographical distribution of the health workforce and more
consideration to the mix of cadres to be scaled-up.

Background
As the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak was finally de-
clared over, a period of unprecedented attention to glo-
bal health security began, with four global commissions
in a space of less than 1 year [1]. Prominent among the
conclusions of those commissions was the need to en-
sure that countries meet, and are supported to meet,
their obligations under the International Health Regula-
tions to fund and build core health system capacities [1].
Kluge et al. summarizes the emerging consensus con-
cerning the inter-dependence of health systems and
health security: Universal Health Coverage (UHC)—or
the achievement of an effective health system—supports
health security by preventing outbreaks of disease for ex-
ample through effective case management by a sufficient
and well-functioning health care workforce, while health
security supports UHC by avoiding crises that under-
mine health system functioning [2].
Widespread consensus in the immediate aftermath
suggested a watershed moment had arrived whereby the
importance of the world’s weakest health systems for
global health security was understood and from where a
sea change in support for the recovery of those health
systems would emerge. For example, Andrew Green,
reporting for the Lancet in 2016 suggested “Now, with
the support of an international community awakened to
the global security threat, there is the chance to begin
filling … gaps. Each (of the three West African coun-
tries) has introduced strategic plans calling for not just
health system fixes, but improvements to all of the con-
ditions that facilitated Ebola’s explosion” [3].
Key to any analysis of pre-Ebola health system weak-
ness and post-Ebola priority targets for health system in-
vestment are shortfalls in the health workforce in all
three countries. Long before the outbreak struck, there
were extensive analyses of the nature of those shortfalls
in each country and proposals for resolving those.
Liberia had made the most significant progress prior to
the outbreak. An Emergency Human Resources Plan
(EHRP) had been implemented between 2007 and 2011,
significantly increasing the numbers of nursing and mid-
wifery cadres in particular. However, in 2010, the num-
ber of clinical health workers per 1000 population had
only reached 1.3, far short of any international bench-
marks. Less progress was made under the EHRP in rela-
tion to the geographical distribution of staff [4].  Sierra
Leone’s health workforce had fallen to a level per 1000
population of 0.2 by 2008, and this workforce was heav-
ily concentrated in urban areas [5]. Jansen et al. showed
that Guinea had less than half the health staff needed at
the beginning of 2014 while projections contrasted
growing need with declining workforce numbers, a par-
ticularly acute divergence for nurses and midwives. Rural
areas projected much larger shortfalls than urban while 
Conakry was projected to contain a large surplus of
health workers [6].
Given such small numbers in the health workforce in
all three countries: Liberia for example had 4653 clinical
health workers in 2010, Sierra Leone had 2672 in 2008,
and Guinea approximately 3000 in 2014 [4–6]; deaths of
an estimated 418 health workers during the Ebola crisis
across all three countries are significant [7]. By anecdote
at least, these losses were compounded by health
workers abandoning their posts during the crisis,1 al-
though other research attests to the commitment and
resilience of health staff in the face of the enormous
challenges posed by the outbreak, including pressure
from families and communities to abandon their posts
[8–10]. Quantitative data related to the workforce losses
other than through mortality are largely absent.
In the light of all these factors, this paper aims to
document and assess the plans in each of the three
countries to strengthen the health workforce situation as
a component of the re-establishment and strengthening
of the health systems that promised to follow the crisis.
As the Ebola virus disease started to recede,
post-Ebola health system investment plans were devel-
oped through extensive consultations in all three coun-
tries. Prepared with strong government leadership, key
stakeholders, and support from the international com-
munity, these plans outline the most critical investments
needed to strengthen the health system in each country
[11].  Among other things, these plans seek to expand
the availability of well-performing health workers at all
levels of the health system and contain workforce
scaling-up targets for each country to aim to achieve.
These plans are dissected in this paper from the per-
spective of their potential contribution to supporting a
revitalized health system, including the extent to which
they will contribute to the resolution of the pronounced
distributional problems described above. The paper fur-
ther costs and compares the plans to likely fiscal space
(the ability of the government to increase spending on
health) to assess their feasibility.
Methods
All three countries analyzed in this paper are
low-income economies as classified by the World Bank
with relatively high infant and under-five mortality rates
(Table 1).
Health workers in this analysis are defined as all cadres
employed in the service of health. This includes care
providers (such as doctors, nurses, and midwives) as well
as allied health professionals and administrative and sup-
port staff. The central analysis of this report, however,
focuses on doctors, nurses, and midwives because of the
existing focus in the international literature on densities

of these cadres and the evidence of their relevance to
health service delivery outcomes (for example, [12, 13]).
Data were coded into the major cadres defined by the
International Standard Classification of Occupations
(ISCO-88).  Public sector payroll data from 2015 were
used for the health workforce analysis. Data were ob-
tained by the World Bank and WHO from the relevant
government departments in the three countries [11]. Al-
though data were verified by government stakeholders,
no formal quality assessment was undertaken. Payroll
data are generally reflective of the public health work-
force on government payroll; this is comparable across
the three countries and likely represents the majority of
the workforce in the country. However, there are short-
comings. Payroll data include some “ghost workers”
(those workers listed on the payroll but who are not ac-
tually working in the system),  and they exclude health
workers who exclusively work in the private sector
(largely concentrated in the capitals in all three coun-
tries) or who work in the public sector but are paid by
NGOs or provide services voluntarily. The 2014 census
data in Guinea, for example, lists 4566 health workers in
the public sector paid by NGOs. In Sierra Leone, this es-
timate is 9000 health workers [11].  However, these are
mostly community health workers (CHW) and therefore
have little bearing on the analysis of doctors, nurses, and
midwives. Payroll data from 2015 do not reflect the re-
sults of recent payroll audits that have been completed 
in Liberia and Sierra Leone, in part to weed out “ghost
workers.” Dual practice is likely to be common so that
many private sector workers are captured on the govern-
ment payroll. This is one respect in which the data re-
quired for a complete labor market analysis were
incomplete or missing. The assumptions and scenarios
developed in relation to health worker training numbers
were also all based on missing or imperfect information.
We managed the lack of reliable information on attrition
by using sensitivity analysis to model hypothetical alterna-
tive estimates of attrition, drop-outs, and employment
rates for illustrative purposes. Lack of defined and
cross-country comparability of rural and urban areas in
Sierra Leone and Liberia were managed by defining the re-
gion including the capital city as urban and all other areas
as rural. This resulted in urban populations of 34.8% in
Guinea, 32.2% in Liberia and 18.9% in Sierra Leone. An-
nual salary estimates were also obtained from payroll data
from government health departments in Liberia, Sierra
Leone, and Guinea. Training cost estimates were sourced
from the One Health Tool used by the governments in
Guinea and Liberia for developing their investment case
plans [11]. Training cost data for Sierra Leone were un-
available and regional costs used in their place. The ana-
lysis and figures should thus be interpreted with these
limitations in mind.
Results
Health workforce stock and distribution: the current
public sector situation
As indicated by analyses from before the outbreak, the
stock of health workers in all three countries is ex-
tremely low, though Liberia fares comparatively better
on this front than Sierra Leone or Guinea in terms of
raw numbers of doctors, nurses, and midwives only
(Fig. 1). Although Guinea has the smallest stock of com-
bined health workers (when all health worker categories
are included), it has a large stock of community health
volunteers and the largest stock of doctors of the three
countries. Liberia has the largest stock of mid-level

Leone—authors calculations based on the current stock available from public
payroll and 2015 population estimates (CIA database)
cadres, and Sierra Leone has the largest stock of
low-level cadres.
These differences are exacerbated when population
levels and the ratio of health workers to population are
taken into account (Additional file 1):  density levels of
doctors, nurses, and midwives per 1000 population in
Liberia are higher than they are in the other two. The
extremely low level of health workers in all three
countries is evident from comparison with regional
averages (Table 2).  Liberia, with the largest density of
all three countries, is only close to half the African
average (with 0.77),  with Guinea and Sierra Leone
falling even further behind (with 0.20 and 0.15,
respectively). 
The distribution of health workers is uneven in all three
countries, although Liberia’s workforce is more evenly dis-
tributed than the others, with 57% of doctors in rural
areas, and 43% in urban areas (the population distribution
is 68% rural and 32% urban). In contrast, in Guinea 98%
of doctors and 88% of nurses reside in urban areas, where
only 36% of the population live; and in Sierra Leone, 92%
of doctors and 72% of nurses reside in urban areas, where
only 18% of the population live (Fig. 2).
Health worker scaling-up ambitions and implications by
investment plans
Health worker scaling-up plans in Guinea and Sierra
Leone run until 2024 and 2025, respectively; in Liberia,
the plan extends until 2021. We assessed the implica-
tions of the density targets identified in the investment
plans in relation to population threshold densities asso-
ciated with increased service delivery coverage, graduate
production, and cost.
The investment plans of Guinea and Liberia mention
specific health worker-to-population density targets to
be achieved; this target is missing in Sierra Leone’s in-
vestment plan. Liberia’s stated target is 1.4 doctors,
nurses, midwives, and physician assistants per 1000
population. Removing physician assistants from this sce-
nario produces a target density of 1.12 per 1000 for doc-
tors, nurses, and midwives alone. Guinea’s stated target
is 0.26 doctors per 1000 population, 0.26 nurses per
1000 population, and 0.26 midwives per 1 000 popula-
tion—this produces a target density of 0.78 per 1000
population for doctors, nurses, and midwives by 2024.
Given the absence of a stated target in Sierra Leone, the
implications of using the densities proposed by the other
two countries are used as a proxy in further analyses.

Fig. 3 Density targets for doctors, nurses, and midwives, compared with international thresholds
The density threshold targets set in the investment
plans are far below both the current regional average
and international thresholds associated with improved
health outcomes and service delivery indicators (Fig. 3).
Commonly used international density thresholds focus
on doctors, nurses, and midwives. All of the targets are
substantially lower than the current regional density
average of 1.33 doctors, nurses, and midwives per 1000
population. They are also significantly lower than a com-
monly used workforce density threshold level of 2.5 per
1000 population [12], which is associated with improved
service delivery coverage, as well as a new threshold of
4.45 per 1000 population which has been proposed in
association with universal health coverage [14].
Hence, targets do not meet the minimum levels re-
quired to achieve adequate service delivery across the
population.
Nevertheless, even the modest density targets in each
investment plan translate into substantial scaling-up re-
quirements for health workers, particularly in Guinea 
and Sierra Leone (Table 3). To achieve the density tar-
gets identified in the investment plans, Liberia would
have to close to double its number of doctors, nurses,
and midwives; annual growth rates for each of the three
cadres would have to be 9.6% to reach the proposed
density targets. Guinea would have to more than
quadruple its health workforce; Guinea’s  annual
growth rates would have to be 17% for each cadre. If
Sierra Leone were to aim to meet the same targets as
Guinea and Liberia, it would have to increase its
current stock by sevenfold (to meet Guinea’s density
threshold) and more than tenfold (to meet Liberia’s):
its annual growth rates would have to be 21.5% or
26%,  depending on the density target chosen. It
should be noted, however, that these growth rates are
premised on small initial numbers.
The total and annual cost implications of the three
countries pursuing their scaling-up ambitions, draw
on a number of assumptions: the total cost includes
both salary and training costs, and the average salary

reflected on the payroll was used (Additional file 2).
Where training cost was not known, the training cost
for a staff group with similar earnings was used.
We modeled a baseline scenario to address attrition
from the workforce, drop out from pre-service train-
ing, and uptake of employment in the public health
sector at the conclusion of pre-service training. This
scenario assumed 10% workforce attrition, a 20%
dropout rate from training, and a 50% employment
rate in the public sector. We calculated the cost of
achieving the proposed targets per head of popula-
tion in each country for this scenario. This was high-
est in Sierra Leone, followed by Liberia; and
substantially lower in Guinea. In Sierra Leone,
achieving a target similar to Guinea’s in 2024 would
cost US$18.25 per capita annually; achieving a target
similar to Liberia’s in 2024 would cost US$24.10 per
capita annually. In Liberia, achieving the proposed
target of 1.12 nurses, midwives, and physicians per
1000 population in 2021 would cost US$8.19 per
capita annually. In Guinea, achieving the proposed
target of 0.78 nurses, midwives, and physicians per
1000 population in 2024 would cost US$1.51 per
capita annually. 
Comparing investment plan targets with globally set
targets for scaling-up workforce
The previous section has shown the investment plan
density targets are far from global targets based on esti-
mates of requirements to achieve minimum service de-
livery coverage and health outcome standards. This
section assesses the growth rates required and costs as-
sociated with reaching the threshold of 2.5 doctors,
nurses, and midwives per 1000 population which is the
more modest international target of those proposed. Be-
cause no reliable cost data were available for Sierra
Leone, the cost projections were done for Guinea and
Liberia only.
Table 4 shows the current numbers of doctors, nurses,
and midwives in each country and how many will be re-
quired to achieve 2.5 per 1000 population density by the
years 2020, 2025, and 2030, on the basis of the mainten-
ance of the current ratios of staff across the three cadres.
These numbers show that a 2020 target for achieving
international targets of health workforce ratios is
clearly not feasible. Setting a later target date of 2030 re-
quires only slightly higher rates of growth than those re-
quired by the investment plans, and the following
discussion is based on that target date.

Figure 4 shows the estimated number of graduates re-
quired to meet the international threshold under the
baseline attrition, training dropout, and public sector
employment scenario.
Costs of achieving the 2.5 density benchmark by
2030 for Guinea and Liberia were calculated on the
basis of the same assumptions as in the previous sec-
tion. For this analysis, we modeled an alternative at-
trition, dropout, and employment scenario to the
baseline scenario, halving losses at each stage, as per
Table 5. Table 6 shows that the cost ranges from
US$4.2 per capita in Guinea to US$ 7.9 per capita in
Liberia, for the alternative scenario in 2029 (the last
year in which trainees graduate to achieve the 2030
target).  The differences across countries reflect large
differences in cost estimates for wages and for train-
ing which are more important in the overall cost pro-
jection than the scenario differences.
Comparing cost estimates with fiscal space projections
This section looks at the extent to which the fiscal space
for HRH (current and projected) in Guinea and Liberia
is sufficient to accommodate the proposed scaling up
and potential scaling up to internationally recommended
density targets. Because of the lack of accurate costing
data, this assessment was not done for Sierra Leone.
GDP and government expenditures have been esti-
mated for 2020 based on IMF projections (as of April
2016)2 (data provided as Additional file 3). Further pro-
jection to 2030 compares a pessimistic scenario (no
growth in these indicators between 2020 and 2030) and
a more optimistic scenario (5% annual growth in these
indicators between 2020 and 2030) (Fig. 5). Based on the
national investment plans, both Guinea and Liberia pro-
ject a declining proportion of total health expenditures
accounted for by the wage bill. If both countries were to
achieve the desired target ratio of doctors, nurses, and
midwives as outlined in their investment plans, the share
of total health expenditure being absorbed by workforce
costs would actually see a reduction from current levels:
from 18 to 12% in Guinea and from 46 to 40% in
Liberia. Overall, the projected fiscal space seems to be
adequate to accommodate the proposed scaling-up tar-
gets outlined in the investment plans of both countries.

Alternate scenario 6.1/0.6  14.3/1.1  33.7/2.3  67.0/4.2
The projection of the costs associated with the ambi-
tion of achieving international doctor, nurse, and mid-
wife density thresholds of 2.5 per 1000 population by
2030 increases the projected share of health workforce
costs in total health expenditure considerably, but to
shares that would not be outliers by international stan-
dards in Guinea (51%) and Liberia (38%),  if growth inhealth budgets is projected after 2020 (see Fig. 5).
Whereas this could suggest that both countries could be
more ambitious in their scale-up, it is important to note
that these densities reflect the levels of doctors, nurses,
and midwives only and do not include all the other
cadres that need to be accommodated by the public sec-
tor wage bill.
Health workforce distribution
The Liberian investment plan includes a housing al-
lowance for 10% of the workforce (in underserved
areas) and plans to develop fair and equitable remu-
neration by introducing and financing a hardship al-
lowance. The Guinean and Sierra Leonean plans
discuss the aim of establishing an effective system of
incentives and allocation of staff to underserved areas,
but specific strategies are not defined. Both countries,
however, point to the importance of carrying out
labor market assessments in order to identify strat-
egies that target solutions to address rural/urban im-
balances. Moreover, both Liberia and Sierra Leone
specifically emphasize the importance of developing a
CHW program with the objective of ensuring greater
health worker coverage in rural areas. Guinea has
similar ambitions.
Table 7 shows the workforce growth rates required
for plan targets in each country, broken down by
rural and urban requirements. The low base for some
of the projections —for example, currently Sierra
Leone has only 22 rural doctors (but 91.9% rural
population)—drives the high growth rates calculated.
The patterns of cadre distribution are not projected
to change (see Fig. 6).
Discussion
There are complex challenges in achieving significant
health system change in the short and medium terms.

Fig. 5 Wage bill as a proportion of health expenditures under different cost projections
This case study shows that achieving even a modest
scale-up of health workforce, a health system component
on which all others rely, to the minimum levels consid-
ered to ensure delivery of even basic services, far less the
level that is considered sufficient to support Universal
Health Coverage requires levels of investment which will
require steady growth in health budgets, a long time
horizon and a substantial initial investment in scaling up
training institutions. In all countries, a critical constraint
is the current capacity of training institutions. All three
countries currently struggle to produce even current
levels of graduate output. Far more international sup-
port is needed for the three countries to address their
current training capacity weaknesses, if acceptable
levels of health workers are to be produced. A suit-
able investment on the part of “an international com-
munity awakened to the global security threat” [3]
would be in supporting a significant scale-up of this
capacity.
There are several caveats in relation to this conclusion.
First, costs were estimated at current financial levels, and
the resulting problems illustrate the importance of esti-
mating societal (economic) costs, even if these can be less
intuitive for users of the information. While Sierra Leone’s
existing cost estimates were not considered reliable for in-
clusion, Guinea’s and Liberia’s cost levels are probably
lower than an estimate of economic cost would suggest.

Sierra Leone (2025) 4.2  49.9  6.8  33.8  6.8  34.3 
Guinea’s estimates used, for example, were US$1200 for a
doctor’s salary per year and US$2800 to train a doctor, re-
spectively. This is probably below the rates the market
would determine (the training cost also reflects low public
sector salaries, the main ingredient in the structure of
training school costs, for example, [15]). This allows for fi-
nancial sustainability in the health budget but will produce
other problems in the scale up, for example, attrition
levels higher than those modeled, or motivation levels as-
sociated with poor quality of care and training. From
that perspective, they are likely to be false economies,
but paying at a more realistic market level might not
be financially sustainable. Both Guinea and Liberia
may also need to ensure that other requirements of
training—related to sufficient physical, technical, and
organizational capacities of health training institu-
tions—are adequately resourced.
Interventions that focus on improving efficiency in
both training institutions and the use of health staff once
trained could further support a trajectory towards an ad-
equate workforce capacity in both volume and motiv-
ation terms at a sustainable cost in all three countries. A
comprehensive assessment of the potential for that is be-
yond the scope of the paper, but there are likely signifi-
cant opportunities to make cost savings relative to the
projections. Significant labor market inefficiencies: loss
of trained staff to attrition; demotivated staff; high levels
of absenteeism are known problems shared at least to
some extent by all three countries [4, 6, 16].  Although
we used the less ambitious scenario in projecting
scale-up costs, real levels of attrition, drop-out, and
scale-up may be higher than these, threatening the sus-
tainability of investments. Furthermore, there are two
key points within the scope of these analyses that indi-
cate clear potential to increase the value for money in
health workforce investment.

Fig. 6 Disaggregated cadre density in rural and urban areas, 2014 and projected
The first is the more efficient geographical distribution
of health staff than any of the three countries is cur-
rently achieving. Reaching the international threshold of
2.5 doctors, nurses, and midwives per 1000 population
will not produce gains in health service coverage and
outcomes if those staff continue to be concentrated in
urban areas to the extent implied by Fig. 2. The ex-
tremes of poor distribution exhibited by Sierra Leone
and Guinea suggest not only a very significant scope to
improve health outcomes by focusing on measures to
improve distribution but a clear implication that the in-
vestment discussed in this paper will not be warranted
at all, if these issues cannot be addressed. However, this
will not reduce the costs of achieving the outcome or
contribute to greater sustainability—it is best viewed as
a pre-requisite for the investment to yield the intended
return.
The second is the mix of cadres that it is proposed to
invest in. Our projections keep the ratios of doctors,
nurses and midwives constant and in line with the
current ratios. Investment focused on nurses and mid-
wives rather than on doctors will reduce costs in all
countries. Scheffler et al. (2016a) estimate a need in
low-income countries for a ratio of approximately 2.5:1
nurses and midwives to doctors [17].  Liberia exceeds
that ratio, Sierra Leone’s ratio is similar, and Guinea is
far below this ratio, suggesting scope particularly in
Guinea, to reduce costs by this strategy. Investment in
other cadres such as physician assistants, as is planned
in Liberia, will also enable more efficient service delivery
and better use of doctors, nurses, and midwives where
their role is to support them. The available evidence has
not quantified the extent to which investment in such
mid-level cadres can substitute for doctors, nurses, and
midwives, but evidence abounds that such substitution
can be cost-effective [18].  A similar case can be made 
for CHWs and volunteers. All three countries plan sub-
stantial scale-up of these and there is evidence that such
workers can be effectively used to support service deliv-
ery and health outcomes [19], but it is not clear the ex-
tent to which they can substitute for professional staff, if
at all. Hence a strategy that would yield a higher rate of
return or allow for a lower cost of investment to achieve
the same outcomes, will involve a reassessment of ap-
propriate ratios of doctors, nurses, and midwives and
their support through investment in complementary
mid-level cadres. This refocusing of health workforce in-
vestment will also make the task of achieving a more ef-
ficient and equitable distribution of staff much easier.
It is also important to recognize that health workforce,
while indispensable to any strategy to strengthen health
systems, is not a sufficient investment on its own. The
workforce will not be effective if other elements of the
health system are not also strengthened. This includes a
need for broader systemic reform to strengthen finan-
cing and decision-making authority at sub-national
levels to facilitate local training, recruitment, and sup-
port provided to both health workers and populations at
those levels [14].
Overall, the case study illustrates that producing a
sea-change in a country’s health system level is not just a
matter of will or a large enough international investment
that might emerge from a new understanding that the
world’s health security is only as strong as its weakest
health system which the Ebola crisis highlighted. Sus-
tainability of substantially strengthened health systems
needs to be achieved within the limited capacities of the
poorest economies. The world’s health security is ultim-
ately dependent on strategies that strengthen health sys-
tems alongside economic development (modeled in our
analysis by growing health budgets over time), and that
reduce global inequality in the process.
