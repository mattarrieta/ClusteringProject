Abstract
Background: Management of Ebola virus disease (EVD) has historically focused on infection prevention, case
detection and supportive care. Several specific anti-Ebola therapies have been investigated, including during the
2014–2016 West African outbreak. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the effect of anti-Ebola virus
therapies on clinical outcomes to guide their potential use and future evaluation.
Methods: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Global Health, Cochrane Library, African Index Medicus, WHOLIS
(inception-9 April 2018), and trial registries for observational studies or clinical trials, in any language, that
enrolled patients with confirmed EVD who received therapy targeting Ebola virus and reported on mortality,
symptom duration, or adverse effects.
Results: From 11,257 citations and registered trials, we reviewed 55 full-text citations, of which 35 met eligibility
criteria (1 randomized clinical trial (RCT), 8 non-randomized comparative studies, 9 case series and 17 case reports)
and collectively examined 21 anti-Ebola virus agents. The 31 studies performed during the West African outbreak
reported on 4.8% (1377/28616) of all patients with Ebola. The only RCT enrolled 72 patients (0.25% of all patients
with Ebola) and compared the monoclonal antibody ZMapp vs. standard care (mortality, 22% vs. 37%; 95%
confidence interval for risk difference, − 36 to 7%). Studies of convalescent plasma, interferon-β-1a, favipiravir,
brincidofovir, artesunate-amodiaquine and TKM-130803 were associated with at least moderate risk of bias.
Conclusions: Research evaluating anti-Ebola virus agents has reached very few patients with EVD, and inferences
are limited by non-randomized study designs. ZMapp has the most promising treatment signal.

Background
The West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic of
2014 to 2016 resulted in at least 28,616 cases and at least
11,310 deaths [1]. Case management in prior Ebola virus
outbreaks has generally focused on isolating patients
with EVD, infection prevention and control procedures,
and various degrees of basic supportive care [2]. During
the West African outbreak, management of EVD in-
volved progressively more advanced supportive care for
patients [3–5].  At the onset of the outbreak, mortality

was approximately 74% [6],  but eventually fell to 31–
37% [7, 8], perhaps due to improved early case finding
and supportive care. Specific anti-Ebola virus treatment
was only rarely available in West Africa. In contrast,
among patients evacuated to European and American
hospitals who received intensive care and anti-Ebola
virus treatments, mortality was 18.5% [3, 9–13].
In prior outbreaks, there was little support to conduct
trials, which meant there was limited evidence to guide
clinical care during the recent West Africa outbreak.
Several anti-Ebola virus treatments had been offered and
administered to patients in West Africa, the United
States and Europe. Most of these treatments had only
recently been developed, not administered as part of a
methodologically rigorous study or trial design, and

therefore their net effects are unknown. To assess their
potential benefit, we systematically reviewed the litera-
ture for all clinical studies that included specific
anti-Ebola virus treatments administered to patients with
EVD and reported on mortality, symptom duration, or
adverse effects.
Methods
There is no published protocol for this review.
Literature search
With the assistance of a medical librarian, we searched
MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Cochrane Library,
African Index Medicus, and World Health Organization
Global Index Medicus (WHOLIS) from inception to 9
April 2018. In MEDLINE and EMBASE, controlled vo-
cabulary terms were combined with keywords for EVD
and a broad range of study design terms, including but
not limited to a sensitive search filter for randomized
clinical trials (RCTs) of therapy [14, 15]. Full details of
the searches are available in Additional file 1. We also
searched Google, Google Scholar, and trial registries’
websites [16–19].  The reference lists of all relevant re-
trieved manuscripts were screened and hand-searched,
and Ebola clinical care experts were consulted to identify
any additional studies.
Selection criteria
We included studies with at least one patient with con-
firmed EVD of any age who received a therapy specifically
targeting Ebola virus itself or its clinical consequences (in-
cluding blood component-based strategies) and reporting
on at least one outcome of interest (mortality, symptom
duration after anti-Ebola treatment initiation, and adverse
effects of the treatment). Eligible study designs included
RCTs, non-randomized single-arm intervention studies
(with or without a control group), prospective and retro-
spective cohort studies, and case reports and case series,
without regard to publication language or date. We ex-
cluded studies of supportive care therapies that did not
specifically target the Ebola virus (e.g. intravenous fluids,
electrolyte and metabolic support, and organ-supportive
care such as mechanical ventilation and renal replace-
ment),  vaccines for EVD primary prevention or post-
exposure prophylaxis, and pre-clinical studies
(e.g. involving animals or cell lines or computer models)
of anti-Ebola treatments.
Two review authors (JSL and HYK),  independently
and in duplicate, screened titles and abstracts of re-
trieved citations and independently assessed full-text
manuscripts of citations considered potentially eligible
by either reviewer. Disagreements were resolved by con-
sensus through discussion with two additional authors
(NKJA and RAF). 
Data extraction and quality appraisal
Two review authors (JSL and HYK) independently and in
duplicate extracted data, including patient baseline char-
acteristics (age, sex), study methods (design, eligibility cri-
teria, and for RCTs, method of randomization, allocation
concealment and blinding),  study interventions and
co-interventions, and clinical outcomes of interest (mor-
tality at the latest time point available, adverse effects).
Three review authors (JSL, KT, RAF) assessed the risk
of bias in the included studies using the Cochrane Col-
laboration’s Risk of Bias 2.0 tool for RCTs [20] and the
ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized intervention and
cohort studies [21]; a fourth author (NKJA) verified se-
lected methodological details of these studies.
Statistical analysis
Where meta-analyses were not possible, we report the
results as stated in the included studies. For each
anti-Ebola virus treatment, we calculated the number
and proportion of patients who died. If warranted on the
basis of a sufficient number of trials (greater than or
equal to 3) and sufficient clinical and methodological
homogeneity, we planned meta-analyses of studies of the
same intervention, using risk ratios and 95% confidence
intervals (CI) to summarize dichotomous outcomes and
weighted or standardized mean differences for continu-
ous outcomes. We planned to assess between-study stat-
istical heterogeneity using the I2 measure [22] and to use
inverse-variance weighted random-effects models [23]
for all meta-analyses to incorporate both between- and
within-study variation. We considered P ≤ 0.05 (two
sided) as statistically significant.
Results
Study selection
From 11,257 citations and studies listed in trial regis-
tries, 55 studies were selected for full-text review, of
which 35 met eligibility criteria (Fig. 1):  1 RCT [24], 8
non-randomized intervention and cohort studies [25–
32], 9 case series [11, 33–40], and 17 case reports pub-
lished in 16 citations [10, 13, 41–54]. These 35 studies
collectively examined 21 anti-Ebola agents, including 9
antivirals, 6 blood- or blood component-based therapies,
3 monoclonal antibody treatments, 2 vascular leak syn-
drome treatments (previously described for other indica-
tions [55, 56]),  and 1 antimalarial drug, which we
included because of the possibility of anti-Ebola virus
effects [57]. Thirty-one eligible studies, published in 30
citations, were conducted during the 2014–2016 West
African outbreak [10, 11, 13, 24–32, 36–40, 42–54] and
reported on 4.8% (1377/28616) of all patients with a
diagnosis of EVD.

RCT and non-randomized studies
Details of the setting, the intervention and control
groups from one RCT and 8 non-randomized interven-
tion studies of anti-Ebola therapies are reported in
Table 1. The 8 non-randomized intervention studies in-
clude 3 single-arm intervention studies with concurrent
controls, 3 single-arm intervention studies with histor-
ical controls, 1 single-arm uncontrolled intervention
study, and 1 retrospective cohort study. The only RCT
[24],  which examined an anti-Ebola virus monoclonal
antibody (ZMapp), enrolled 72 patients (0.25% of all pa-
tients with Ebola from the West African outbreak). Al-
though the trial’s risk of bias is low (Table 2),  the
number of patients enrolled is small and the results are
accordingly imprecise (Table 3).  Mortality was 22% (8/
36) in the ZMapp group and 37% (13/35) in the stand-
ard care group. Using Bayesian analysis, the posterior
probability that ZMapp was superior to usual care was
91.2%,  failing to meet the pre-specified threshold of
97.5%.  Frequentist analysis showed a statistically non- 
significant risk difference of 15% favouring ZMapp (95%
confidence interval [CI], − 36% [favouring ZMapp] to 7%
[favouring usual care]).
Risk of bias in all non-randomized single-arm intervention
studies of convalescent plasma [28], whole blood [26], favi-
piravir [29],  interferon-β-1a [27],  artesunate-amodiaquine
[32], TKM-130803 [25], and brincidofovir [31] was at least
moderate (Table 2). Comparisons of mortality and adverse
events between intervention and control arms were limited
by non-randomized study designs (Table 3).
In the study of convalescent plasma, the intervention
was associated with mortality of 31% (26/84) compared
to 38% (158/418) in the historical control group, with an
adjusted odds ratio of death of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.51 to
1.51) [28].  Limitations of this study include unknown
level of neutralizing antibodies in plasma, small sample
size in the intervention group, lack of data on the deliv-
ery of co-interventions and supportive care, and inclu-
sion of historical controls. Among patients treated with
convalescent whole blood [26],  mortality was 28% (12/

adolescent patients evaluated, favipiravir was generally
well tolerated. However, the lack of a concurrent con-
trol group and uncertainty in patient selection criteria
leads to moderate risk of bias. In another non-
randomized single-arm study, mortality was 44%
(17/39) in the favipiravir group and 65% (55/85) in
the historical control group; however, the non-
random assignment of the intervention, lack of a
concurrent control group, and the potential for differ-
ential between-group treatments lead again to moder-
ate risk of bias [30]. 
Interferon β-1a was examined in a non-randomized
single-arm study and compared to controls, finding 21-day
mortality of 33% (3/9) in the interferon β-1a group and
84% (32/38) in the expanded control group [27].  The
non-random assignment of the intervention, lack of a
priori sample size calculation, and potential for differential
between-group treatments lead to moderate risk of bias.

50% (36/71) during a period of drug shortage when
artesunate-amodiaquine was used instead [32]. However,
there is moderate risk of bias due to the potential for
unmeasured residual confounding; in addition, the bio-
logical plausibility of artesunate-amodiaquine as an
anti-Ebola virus agent is uncertain.
In two non-randomized single-arm studies, TKM-
130803 was associated with a 14-day mortality of 75%
(9/12) compared 67% (2/3) mortality in the control
group [25], and brincidofovir-associated 14-day mortality
was 100% (4/4) [31]. The study designs lead to moderate
risk of bias.
Given the small number of studies (often only one) of
any single intervention and substantial heterogeneity in
study design, we did not conduct any meta-analyses. 
Case series and reports
Study details for 26 case series and case reports (re-
ported in 25 publications) are presented in Additional
file 1: Table S1, including the number of patients, coun-
try of infection, location of clinical care, anti-Ebola virus
treatment given, critical care interventions, and clinical
outcomes. Duplicate patient descriptions were noted
among 13 manuscripts. One case series described pa-
tients (some previously reported in other studies) who
received care in Europe or the USA [39],  and another
case series described patients (some previously reported
in other studies) who received care in Sierra Leone [40].
Excluding these two cases series, a total of 32 patients
receiving anti-Ebola virus therapies were described in
case series and case reports, with a mortality of 22% (7/
Page 8
Lee et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2019) 19:376  Page 8 of 11
32).  Some patients received > 1 anti-Ebola virus agent,
including blood-based therapies (n = 25),  monoclonal
antibodies (n = 10), antivirals (n = 19), and therapies for
vascular leak syndrome (n = 3).
Among these 26 case series and case reports, 3 case
series described 11 patients who received anti-Ebola
virus therapies (convalescent whole blood, Virustat
[acyclovir],  gamma globulin, Marburg convalescent
plasma) in Africa prior to the West African EVD out-
break of 2014–2016. An additional report described a
patient who received anti-Ebola virus therapies (conva-
lescent plasma, human interferon) in the United King-
dom prior to the West African EVD outbreak. Four
reports described 4 patients who received anti-Ebola
virus treatment in West Africa (convalescent whole
blood, ZMapp, convalescent leukocytes, GS-5743, favi-
piravir) during the 2014–2016 outbreak. Three case
series and 1 case report described 4 patients who initially
received anti-Ebola virus therapies in West Africa (con-
valescent whole blood, ZMapp, TKM-100802) before
transfer to the USA. Finally, 3 case series and 1 case re-
port described 5 patients who received anti-Ebola virus
therapies solely in the USA, and 8 case reports described
7 patients who received anti-Ebola virus therapies solely
in Europe.
Additional file 1: Table S2 presents the number of pa-
tients and mortality rates of 18 patients who were
treated with an anti-Ebola virus therapy in addition to
receiving intensive care. Mortality was 29% (2/7) in pa-
tients who received positive pressure ventilation, 25% (6/
24) in those who received central venous access or
hemodynamic support, 40% (2/5) in those who received
renal replacement therapy, 15% (2/13) in those who re-
ceived non-convalescent blood product transfusions, and
14% (1/7) in those who received parental nutrition. No
information about critical care interventions was de-
scribed in the remaining 14 patients
Additional file 1: Table S3 characterizes the setting,
anti-Ebola virus therapy, primary outcome, and status of
9 registered trials of anti-Ebola treatments that have not
yet been completed or published as of the search date of
April 2018. Crude mortality is described in 9 case series
and 17 case reports of anti-Ebola virus treatments
(Additional file 1: Table S4)
Discussion
In this systematic review, we identified 1 RCT, 8 non-
randomized single-arm intervention studies and cohort
studies, 9 case series and 17 case reports evaluating 21
anti-Ebola virus therapies. The single RCT evaluated the
monoclonal antibody ZMapp, had a low risk of bias, and
found a statistically non-significant decrease in mortal-
ity. All interventions evaluated in non-randomized
studies, including convalescent whole blood or 
plasma, interferon β-1a, favipiravir and the antimalar-
ial artesunate-amodiaquine, were associated with an
overall moderate risk of bias, and in some cases ser-
ious or critical risk of bias due to confounding, se-
verely limiting inferences regarding treatment effects.
The non-randomized evaluations of brincidofovir and
TKM-130803 do not provide evidence to support fu-
ture evaluation.
The strengths of this study include a comprehensive
search of published and available non-published clinical
literature, triplicate and independent assessment of risk
of bias according to the Cochrane framework, and dupli-
cate independent data abstraction. Our review is the first
to summarize all such literature in humans with EVD. A
previous systematic review included drug screening and
pre-clinical studies and fewer clinical studies (n = 9) than
we included, and focused on identifying existing drugs
with potential therapeutic effect [58]. Other reviews pro-
vide further information on selected clinical studies of
anti-Ebola virus therapies [59, 60], in addition to details
of in vitro and animal studies [59].
However, there are many limitations of such a review.
We are limited in inferences due to the moderate to ser-
ious risk of bias of the majority of studies and the small
number of enrolled patients, leading to one RCT and
many non-randomized studies all under-powered to de-
tect differences in mortality. The small number of stud-
ies (often only one) of any single intervention and
important heterogeneity in study design precluded
meta-analyses. Several agents with promising pre-clinical
findings or case report-based evaluations cannot yet be
evaluated for effectiveness based on existing data and
study designs. These include the nucleotide analogue
prodrug remdesivir (GS-5734), the monoclonal antibody
cocktail REGN3470–3471-3479, and the monoclonal
antibody MAb114 [61], which in addition to ZMapp and
favipiravir, have been evaluated by a World Health
Organization-convened independent scientific commit-
tee for monitored emergency use of unregistered and in-
vestigational interventions, while awaiting additional
evidence [62].  Finally, peer review and evaluations of
additional therapies may be forthcoming; however, we
believe that we are unlikely to have missed any publica-
tions of evaluable treatment effects.
Evaluating the effect of treatments on clinical out-
comes of patients with EVD is challenging because of its
uncommon, periodic, and lethal nature. There have been
few pre-existing therapies with strong evidence of poten-
tial treatment effect, making prioritization difficult for
clinicians, researchers, regulators and funders. Out-
breaks have occurred in resource-challenged health sys-
tems in West Africa and most recently in DR Congo,
Central Africa [63], often in remote areas with delayed
recognition of the outbreak’s onset [64, 65].  Small

outbreaks may end before any clinical or research re-
sponse. A historically high mortality rate, including
among healthcare workers, leads to diminished clinical
capacity for care and research, but also a reluctance to
consider using the methodologically strongest RCT de-
sign because of the implication that some patients will
not receive a potentially beneficial investigational agent.
The variable standard of supportive care contributes to a
baseline high mortality rate but also makes estimation of
treatment effects difficult, possibly leading to selection
of patients who are poorly responsive to investigational
anti-Ebola virus agents and an inability to compare ther-
apies across studies [6, 66].  Uniform adoption of
evidence-based supportive care guidelines [67] in future
outbreaks may facilitate the evaluation of anti-Ebola
virus therapies.
West African nations most affected in 2014–2016 had
not previously experienced an Ebola outbreak, and there
was limited pre-existing Ebola-specific clinical and re-
search capacity. With overwhelmed national healthcare
systems and a slow international response, there was lit-
tle opportunity to evolve interventional research pro-
grams in parallel with outbreak care. Eventually, early
diagnostic and descriptive studies gave rise to an appre-
ciation of the potential impact of supportive and specific
EVD therapy [39, 66]. However, among 28,616 infected
patients, fewer than 5% had any therapies described or
evaluated and only 0.25% participated in a RCT.
This review is a comprehensive summary of data col-
lected on the effects of specific anti-Ebola therapies.
Given Ebola’s high mortality rate, sparse treatment op-
tions, and high capacity for spread, it is imperative that
an adequate research capacity in Ebola outbreak-prone
regions be developed and well-supported by the inter-
national community. Rigorous prior knowledge synthesis
is critical to plan relevant future research. At this stage,
the small number of patients exposed to each interven-
tion and design-related limitations preclude strong infer-
ences on clinical effectiveness. However, a  better
understanding of the paucity of supportive evidence is
valuable for various stakeholders. Decision-makers con-
fronted with EVD outbreaks in the future may use these
results to prioritize or avoid system-wide delivery of cer-
tain experimental interventions. Guideline developers
might use the evidence summary to make graded recom-
mendations regarding specific anti-Ebola virus therapies.
Lastly, highlighting the insufficiencies of the existing
body of evidence could help researchers to design future
studies for implementation during an outbreak and to
prioritize experimental therapies for future evaluation.
Conclusions
In this systematic review, we found only one RCT of
anti-Ebola virus therapy that was associated with a low 
risk of bias and a signal of a treatment effect, suggesting
that the monoclonal antibody ZMapp should be priori-
tized for further evaluation in another EVD outbreak.
Moderate to serious risk of bias and small sample sizes
preclude strong inferences regarding the clinical effects
of convalescent whole blood or plasma, favipiravir, inter-
feron β-1a, and the antimalarial artesunate-amodiaquine.
