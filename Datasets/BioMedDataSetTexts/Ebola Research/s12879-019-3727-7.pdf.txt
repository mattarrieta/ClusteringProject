manifestations, and treatment outcome of
139 paediatric Ebola patients treated at a
Sierra Leone Ebola treatment center

Abstract
Background: The West Africa Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in 2014–2016 was declared by the World Health
Organization (WHO) a public health emergency of international concern. Most of the previous studies done in
Sierra Leone relating to the clinical and epidemiological features of EVD during the 2014–2016 West African
outbreak focused on adult EVD patients. There have been conflicting reports about the effects of EVD on children
during previous outbreaks.
Methods: This is an observational retrospective analysis of medical data of all laboratory confirmed paediatric EVD
patients below 15 years of age who were admitted at the 34 Military Hospital Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) in
Wilberforce, Sierra Leone between June 2014 to April 2015. We analyzed the sociodemographic and clinical
characteristics of paediatric EVD cases contained in case report forms that were collected by Ebola surveillance
officers and clinicians at the 34 Military Hospital ETC. Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression models
were used to determine the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of paediatric EVD patients that were
associated with EVD facility-based mortality.
Results: The majority of the paediatric EVD cases in this study were female (56.1%), pupils (51.1%), and 43.2%
belonged to the age group between 10 years and below 15 years. The median age of the paediatric EVD cases was
9 years (interquartile range = 4 to 11 years). Adjusting for other covariates in the model, male paediatric EVD patient
(AOR = 13.4, 95% CI = [2.07–156-18], p < 0.05), EVD patient with abdominal pain (AOR = 11.0, 95% CI = [1.30–161.81],
p < 0.05), vomiting (AOR = 35.7, 95% CI = [3.43–833.73], p < 0.05), signs of conjunctivitis (AOR = 17.4, 95% CI = [1.53–
342.21], p < 0.05) and difficulty in breathing (AOR = 23.3, 95% CI = [1.92–713.01], p < 0.05) at the time of admission
had increased odds of dying during EVD treatment.
Conclusions: We recommend the adoption of case definitions currently in vigour to cater for specific
characteristics of paediatric patients. Subgroups that can be identified by applying the model developed in this
study may require special attention and intensified care.

Background
Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a severe infectious disease
that was discovered in the Democratic Republic of
Congo in 1976 [1–3]. The virus that causes EVD belongs
to the Filoviridae family [1, 4].  An EVD outbreak in
West Africa which was detected in March 2014
prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to de-
clare it a “public health emergency of international con-
cern”  [5, 6].  According to the WHO there were
ultimately more than 28,000 cases and more than 11,000
deaths in the course of the West African Ebola outbreak
[7]. Humans become infected with EVD by coming into
direct contact with infected human bodily fluids, or the
bodily fluids or organs of infected bush animals such as
bats, monkeys and chimpanzees [5]. Sierra Leone which
was also heavily affected [5] by the West African EVD
outbreak recorded its first case in May 2014 [8].  Most
studies relating to the clinical and epidemiological fea-
tures of EVD at the time of the West African outbreak
focused on adult EVD patients. WHO Ebola Response
Team [5],  Schieffelin et al. [9],  Lado et al [10] and
Agua-Agum J, et al [11] have published extensive details
of the clinical, laboratory and epidemiological character-
istics of mixed cohort of patients affected by the West
African EVD outbreak. Mostly biased by the WHO case
definition for a suspected Ebola case, the majority of the
patients affected in Sierra Leone by the West African
outbreak like others in previous ones were characterized
by fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat,
vomiting, diarrhea, rash, kidney, liver function failure,
sometimes bleeding (although to a lesser extent than
previously known),  and an incubation period of 2–21
days (median, 14 days) [1, 2, 5, 12].
There have been conflicting reports about the effects
of EVD on children during EVD outbreaks. McElroy
AK, et al. reported a Case Fatality Rate (CFR) of 100%
(for children EVD cases for whom serum were available),
and 28.6% for children < 5 years and 6–15 years respect-
ively for the 2000–2001 EVD outbreak in Gulu district,
Uganda [13]. Different studies reported a moderate CFR
(57.1%) for paediatric EVD cases during the 2014–2016
EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone [14, 15]. Peacock et al. re-
ported data for children EVD cases from different out-
breaks [16] which tend to suggests that the proportion
of EVD infected children varies for different settings and
over time. There were more (79.0%) paediatric EVD
cases compared to EVD cases belonging to the age
group of 15 years and above during the 2000–2001 EVD
outbreak in Uganda [13].  Leligdowicz A et al. however
reported a lower (19%) EVD cases for children compared
to cases 15 years and above for the 2014–2016 West
African EVD outbreak [17]. Also, the proportion of chil-
dren involved in the 1995 EVD outbreak in Zaire was
27/315 (9%),  90/218 (41%) for the 2000–2001 Sudan 
strain EVD outbreak in Gulu, Uganda, and 147/823
(18%) for the 4 most affected countries in the 2014–
2016 EVD outbreak in West Africa [18].  The World
Health Organisation (WHO) reported increasing inci-
dence of EVD cases with increasing age among children
in Liberia and Sierra Leone but this pattern was not ob-
served for children in Guinea [11]. Previous papers have
claimed that children were relatively spared during EVD
outbreaks [11, 19]; which portrays that there is variation
in the epidemiology, clinical features and outcomes of
paediatric EVD cases [20].  Skrips LA, et al. attributed
the high incidence of paediatric EVD cases to the less re-
striction of contact by children coupled with their lim-
ited or non-existent understanding of the mechanisms
of EVD transmission dynamics [21]. Athena P and col-
leagues however attributed the small percentage of glo-
bal EVD cases for children to cultural practices [22]. In
spite of claims that children had reduced risks of infec-
tion as compared to adults [19, 23] in previous EVD out-
breaks, and that paediatric EVD cases were
underreported during the 2014–2016 West African EVD
outbreak [13, 24],  the West African EVD outbreak re-
corded a high CFR in children younger than 5 years [9,
11, 25]. Cumulative CFR for the West African EVD out-
break varies but was approximated at 40% [5] with
young children and older adults having the highest CFRs
[9]. There are reports of disproportionate CFRs among
children affected by the 2014–2016 West African out-
break [9, 26]. Schieffelin J.S et al. reported a cumulative
CFR of 73.4, 66.1 and 80.4% for children < 15 years, 15–
44 years and for EVD patients > 45 years respectively [9].
One Ugandan study involving 55 confirmed EVD cases
infected with Sudan Virus Ebola strain reported a high
survival rate for children compared to adult [13].
Clinical data and studies on paediatric EVD treatment
outcomes relating to the West African EVD outbreak are
scarce, often with small sample sizes [25] and largely fo-
cused on reported symptoms by EVD patients on arrival
for admission [1, 2, 5, 9, 12, 25, 27]. For previous EVD stud-
ies, the number of paediatric EVD patients in a cohort in-
vestigated ranges between 20 and 55 laboratory-confirmed
EVD cases [13, 23]. Kourtis A. P et al [22] argued that the
fewer studies involving paediatric EVD cases can be attrib-
uted to the fact that less number of children become in-
fected with EVD compared to adults due to their lower risk
of exposure to EVD which includes caring for EVD sick
patients-either in a healthcare setting or at home, and or
handling the remains of persons who have died of EVD.
The CFR in EVD in neonates is generally higher than
in children in other age groups. All neonates born to
previously infected EVD mothers died within 19 days
after birth during the 1976 outbreak in Zaire [28] and
subsequent outbreaks have also confirmed such observa-
tions [29].

There is no approved EVD treatment or vaccine against
EVD [6, 30] but supportive care and management by
intravenous fluids intake proved to be crucial for EVD pa-
tient survival during the 2014–2016 outbreak [6, 30].
However currently there are series of experimental therap-
ies and vaccines including brincidofovir [31], ZMapp [18],
TKM 130803 [32], Favipiravir [33], the monoclonal anti-
body MAb114 [34], and convalescent plasma of EVD pa-
tients [35] that has been approved by the WHO for use
during outbreaks on compassionate ground.
In this study we describe the epidemiological charac-
teristics, clinical manifestations and treatment outcome
of 139 laboratory-confirmed paediatric EVD patients
below 15 years of age who were admitted at the 34 Mili-
tary Hospital Ebola Treatment Center (ETC) in Wilber-
force, Sierra Leone between June 2014 to April 2015.
We also determine the factors that are associated with
EVD treatment outcomes of these EVD confirmed
paediatric EVD cases using a large dataset. Early studies
that investigated paediatric EVD cases were faced with
many limitations including small sizes, incomplete pa-
tient information, selection and lead time biases. The
main strength of this study is our large sample size of
paediatric EVD cases belonging to the age group 0 –
below 5 years coupled with the fact that our data came
from an operational and hence reflect the ground reality.
Methods
Study design
Our study is an observational retrospective study that in-
cluded all laboratory confirmed EVD patients below 15
years of age who were admitted at the 34 Military Hospital
ETC situated in Wilberforce section of Freetown in Sierra
Leone between June 2014 to April 2015.
These confirmed paediatric EVD patients were
brought to the 34 Military Hospital triage center that
was located at the Accident and Emergency Department
by their parents or relatives because they were referred
by EVD surveillance health workers of the National
Ebola Response Surveillance Team, self-referred after
coming in contact with a suspected or confirmed Ebola
case, or because they presented with key Ebola signs and
symptoms such as fever, headache, joint pain, diarrhoea,
vomiting, or and bleeding [1, 2, 5, 9, 10, 12].  All EVD
paediatric patients were first screened by trained clini-
cians against the WHO definition for a suspected EVD
case [28] prior to EVD laboratory confirmation testing.
Ebola is classified in three clinical stages: Stage one EVD
which is also known as the dry or early phase is charac-
terised by the absence of vomiting, diarrhoea, or organ
dysfunction; Stage two which is also referred to as the
wet phase is characterised by vomiting and diarrhoea;
and Stage three or the organ dysfunction phase of which
human organ failure is the most prominent feature. 
For all paediatric EVD cases laboratory confirmation
tests were done using real-time quantitative reverse tran-
scriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) method
at the National Public Health Laboratory at Lakkah in
Freetown, Sierra Leone.
EVD treatment protocol
All laboratory-confirmed EVD cases in this study were rou-
tinely provided oral rehydration salts with dose dependent
on the severity of the dehydration of the paediatric EVD
patient; intravenous lactated Ringer’s solution and other
supplements to correct for electrolyte imbalance; acet-
aminophen or ibuprofen for muscle pain and headache,
anti-infective ciprofloxacin or cefixime, and the anti-
malaria drug naphthoquine phosphate tablets. The antacid
drugs ranitidine or omeprazole were given to patients ex-
periencing upper abdominal pain. EVD treatments in this
study were performed in accordance with the World Health
Organisation (WHO) protocol of urgent interim guidance
for EVD case management for viral haemorrhagic fever
[30]. The treatment method in the other ETCs that were
operating in Sierra Leone during the 2014–2016 EVD out-
break was mostly supportive and mostly included maintain-
ing electrolyte balance in EVD patients.
Sierra Leone health infrastructure
Sierra Leone is located in West Africa. There is one gov-
ernment referral hospital in each of the 5 provinces or na-
tional areas. The rural areas of Sierra Leone are also
served by several district health hospitals (DHHs), com-
munity health centers (CHCs) and community health
posts (CHPs). All government referral hospitals and some
DHHs served as either an ETC or an Ebola Holding Cen-
ter (EHC) during the 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak. During
the EVD outbreak several hospitals and health care facil-
ities that were run by foreign organizations also operated
ETCs. The 34 Military Hospital which provided data for
this study is a 150-bed hospital located in the capital city
Freetown. The hospital which is headed by a Brigadier
Surgeon General is operated by medical doctors and para-
medics that are attached to the 34th Military Battalion of
the Sierra Leone Armed Forces (SLAF).
Ethics review
The Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee
(Opinion Date March 29, 2017) and the Institutional Re-
view Board at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Mun-
ich, Germany (Opinion No. LMU 17–582) approved this
study. The Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Com-
mittee provided ethical clearance for conducting this study
and waived the requirement to obtain informed consent on
the grounds that this is an observational retrospective study
on patients in charge in a medical facility under circum-
stances that did not allow at that time for individualized
Page 4
Kangbai et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2019) 19:81  Page 4 of 9
informed consent, and that data is resented in an aggregate
manner focusing on outcome in one entire facility.
Data collection and processing
At the 34 Military Hospital ETC trained clinicians and
Ebola surveillance officers compiled on hard copies of CRF
the medical history containing demographic, laboratory
and clinical information of all suspected paediatric EVD pa-
tients who presented themselves with key signs and symp-
toms associated with EVD. We later transferred the
medical data of all laboratory confirmed paediatric EVD
patients from the CRF to a Microsoft Excel (Microsoft,
Redmond, Washington, USA) [36] form for both descrip-
tive and analytical statistics processing. The medical data of
confirmed paediatric EVD patients included both clinical
(whether patient had fever, headache, joint pain, anorexia,
muscle pain, chest pain, abdominal pain, cough, diarrhoea,
vomiting, fatigue, bleeding, skin rash, difficulty in swallow-
ing or breathing, conjunctivitis and being in a confused
state at the time of admission) and demographic data (age
group, sex, education level). This study analysed the anon-
ymized medical data of 139 paediatric EVD patients. The
data were anonymized by Ebola surveillance data entry
clerks and clinicians attached at the 34 Military Hospital in
Freetown, Sierra Leone. The anonymized data were later
stored in secured computer files at the 34 Military Hospital
in Freetown, Sierra Leone.
Statistical analysis
R software package version 3.3.1 [37] was used for all data
analyses; the source codes are available upon request. A
p-value < 0.05 was considered as statistical significance for
all two-sided statistical tests. We present as frequencies,
proportions, means (standard deviations) and medians
(interquartile ranges) the outputs of descriptive analysis
and used Fisher’s Exact test to compare proportion of
various variables. Both univariate and multivariate logistic
regression model were used to determine the clinical and
non-clinical characteristics of paediatric EVD patients that
were associated with EVD in-facility mortality. To under-
stand the association between education and in-facility
mortality (CFR) we grouped the paediatric EVD patients
into two; no-education and education groups. The educa-
tion group is comprised of paediatric EVD cases with ei-
ther primary or secondary education while the paediatric
EVD patients in the no-education group have no educa-
tion experience. We later used the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (ROC) to determine our logistic
model’s ability to predict whether a paediatric EVD patient
will be cured given certain clinical and sociodemographic
characteristics of a patient. We then calculated the Area
Under the Curve (AUC) value obtained from the ROC
curve to determine the accuracy of the model to predict
paediatric EVD patient treatment outcome. 
Results
Descriptive characteristics of cases
Between June 2014 to April 2015, 1076 confirmed EVD
cases, of which 139 (12.9%) were paediatric cases below
15 years of age, were admitted at the 34 Military Hospital
ETC for EVD treatment. January 2015 recorded the high-
est number of confirmed EVD cases to be admitted at the
34 Military Hospital ETC, with 326 patients in total ad-
mitted, of which 52 (16.0%) were paediatric cases.
Demographic factors
The majority of the paediatric EVD cases were female (78/
139, 56.1%), pupils (71/139, 51.1%), and (60/139, 43.2%)
belonged to the age group between 10 years and below 15
years (Table 1).  The median age of the paediatric EVD
cases was 9 years (interquartile range = 4 to 11 years).
Case fatality rate
The overall CFR among the admitted 139 confirmed
paediatric EVD patients was 22.3% (31/139). One hundred
and eight out of 139 (77.7%) paediatric EVD patients were
discharged alive from the 34 Military Hospital ETC after
treatment. There was a statistically significant association
between gender, age groups and education levels and the
CFR for paediatric EVD cases. Male paediatric patients
had higher (34.4%) CFR than female (CFR = 12.8%,  p
< 0.05). There was a negative correlation between paediat-
ric EVD patient age and CFR. The CFR for paediatric
EVD patients below 5 years of age was higher (CFR =
37.8%, p < 0.05) than those of patients between 5 years to
less than 10 years of age (CFR = 26.2%);  and 10 years to
less than 15 years of age (CFR = 10.0%).
The CFR for paediatric EVD patients with no education
was higher (CFR = 37.8%, p < 0.05) compared to those at
primary level education (CFR = 23.9%). All paediatric EVD
patients with secondary level education who were treated
in this study were released alive after treatment.
Clinical symptoms
The majority of the paediatric EVD cases at the time of
admission had anorexia (99.1%),  chest pain (98.6%),
muscle pain (97.8%), headache (95.0%), fever (82.7%), diar-
rhoea (71.3%),  fatigue (67.0%),  Stage 2 EVD infection
(64.0%) and abdominal pain (59.7%) when they reported
at 34 Military Hospital ETC for admission (Table 2). There
was a statistically significant association between EVD
paediatric patients with diarrhoea, vomiting, fatigue, skin
rash, bleeding, difficulty in swallowing, conjunctivitis, dif-
ficulty in breathing, Stage 2 and 3 EVD infections com-
pared to those without these characteristics. All paediatric
EVD patients with skin rash at the time of admission died
during treatment (CFR = 100%,  p = 0.05) compared to
21.2% of paediatric EVD patients without skin rash at the
time of admission who died during treatment. Paediatric

Multivariate analysis of facility based mortality
Our stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis
shows that male paediatric EVD patient, paediatric EVD
patient who vomited, had abdominal pain, difficulty in
breathing, and conjunctivitis at the time of admission were
the most important factors associated with paediatric
EVD facility based mortality. There were differences in the
likelihood that a paediatric EVD patient will die during
EVD treatment related to gender difference, or whether
EVD patient reported abdominal pain, difficulty in breath-
ing, conjunctivitis or vomiting at the time of admission.
Holding other covariates in the model constant, male
paediatric EVD patient (AOR = 13.4, 95% CI = [2.07–
156-18], p < 0.05), abdominal pain (AOR = 11.0, 95% CI
= [1.30–161.81], p < 0.05), vomiting (AOR = 35.7, 95% CI
= [3.43–833.73],  p < 0.05),  conjunctivitis (AOR = 17.4,
95% CI = [1.53–342.21], p < 0.05) and difficulty in breath-
ing (AOR = 23.3, 95% CI = [1.92–713.01], p < 0.05) had in-
creased odds of dying during EVD treatment (Table 3).
Our ROC shows that the model including the charac-
teristics sex, abdominal pain, vomiting, conjunctivitis
and difficulty in breathing has a high discriminative cap-
ability for selecting paediatric EVD cases who will be
cured during treatment with an AUC of 0.94 (Fig. 1).
Discussion
The West African EVD outbreak in 2014–2016 recorded the
highest number of incidence and mortality rates since the 
discovery of Ebola virus in 1976 [5, 22]. Our study described
the treatment outcomes of 139 laboratory-confirmed paedi-
atric EVD patients admitted at the 34 Military Hospital in
Wilberforce, Sierra Leone between June 2014 to April 2015.
Paediatric EVD cases in previous outbreaks have been as-
sumed to be underreported because of outbreak dynamics
and societal structure [13].  Our study reported a slightly
higher proportion of female (56.1%) EVD cases compared to
male which is consistent to one Ugandan study [23]. The
Ugandan study which analyzed data from an EVD outbreak
in Gulu district attributed the high incidence of female
paediatric EVD cases to household chores given to female
children such as providing patient care in the home. This
traditional role of the girl child is also common in Sierra
Leone. Compared to other age groups in our study, paediat-
ric EVD patients below 5 years of age recorded the highest
CFR (37.8%); which is similar to findings in other studies [8,
13, 38]. One mixed cohort study involving adult and paediat-
ric EVD cases reported a high CFR among young children
and elderly EVD patients in the 2014–2016 West African
EVD outbreak [5]. Another Ugandan study that investigated
the 2000–2001 Sudan virus strain EVD outbreak in Gulu
district reported a CFR of 76.9 and 37.5% for 55 paediatric
laboratory-confirmed EVD patients below 5 years; and be-
tween 6 years to below 15 years of age respectively [16]. The
relatively higher CFR among paediatric EVD patients below
5 years in our study is associated to the shorter incubation
period of the disease in this set of patients. As reported in a

Table 3 shows the output of a univariate and a multivariate analysis of paediatric EVD patients sociodemographic and clinical variables associated with EVD
treatment outcomes. The crude OR is obtained by a logistic regression model with only that one variable as predictor. The adjusted OR is obtained from a
multivariate logistic regression model, starting with all available sociodemographic and clinical predictors, after a stepwise backward elimination using the Akaike

Fig. 1 ROC Curve on determinants and treatment outcome. The ROC
curve shows that the model after stepwise logistic regression selection
has a high capacity to discriminate paediatric EVD patient treatment
outcome using their clinical and demographic characteristics
previous study, EVD has a shorter incubation period among
paediatric cases below 10 years of age [39]. Our overall CFR
(22.3%) was substantially lower compared to the CFR for the
13 previous Zaire EVD outbreaks combined (81.0%) [40] as
well as for the average CFR (71.0%) computed by the WHO
for mixed age groups for the 2014–2016 West African EVD
outbreak [5]. However, it has to be kept in mind that our
study is reporting facility based CFRs. Some studies associ-
ated the high case fatalities in previous Zaire EVD outbreaks
with clinical determinants such as multiple foci of
hemorrhage [28, 29].
Our higher CFR for paediatric EVD patients with no
education compared to those with primary and secondary
levels education may not be unconnected to the role
played by health workers and school authorities in raising
awareness and sensitizing school children about the trans-
mission methods and effects of Ebola during the 2014–
2016 outbreak. Both primary and secondary schools pupils
benefited from daily health education programs dealing
with the signs and symptoms, transmission methods, pre-
ventive and control measures of Ebola. Early identification
of EVD signs and symptoms backed by early treatment in-
creases one’s odds of surviving EVD treatment. EVD pa-
tients that report early for treatment experience less
severe presentation at the time of diagnosis compared to
those who report late. T.E.C. Jones-Konneh et al. reported
that the expert knowledge and skills of health practi-
tioners made the difference in controlling and reducing
the impact of the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone [41].
Another Sierra Leone study by Stehling-Ariza T and col-
leagues attributed the quicker identification of suspected
Ebola cases as well as the interruption of Ebola transmis-
sion to active case surveillance and health education dur-
ing the outbreak period [42].
The majority of the paediatric EVD cases in our study re-
ported fever, headache, anorexia, muscle pain, chest pain, ab-
dominal pain, diarrhoea, fatigue and Stage 2 EVD infection 
at the time for admission at 34 Military Hospital ETC.
Elhadji Ibrahim Bah et al. [30],  Olupot-Olupot [31],  and
Theocharopoulos et al. [32] had similar findings for mixed
age groups but excluding Stages of EVD infection for pa-
tients investigated during 2014–2016 West African outbreak.
Elhadji Ibrahim et al. described 37 laboratory-confirmed
mixed cohort EVD patients with median age of 38 years, ma-
jority (65.0%) of whom were men, fever (84.0%),  fatigue
(65.0%), and diarrhea (62.0%) with a CFR of 43.0% [30]. In
his review Olupot-Olupot noted that typical paediatric EVD
symptoms for cases less than 12 years of age include mostly
fever, weakness, loss of appetite, profuse diarrhea, vomiting
and bleeding; in older children headache, backache, chest
pain and abdominal pain are playing a more prominent role
[31].  Theocharopoulos G et al. studied 249 confirmed
mixed-cohort of EVD cases with a 45.0% CFR of which mal-
aise (90.0%),  fever (83.0%),  diarrhoea (63.0%),  headache
(73.0%) and vomiting (60.0%) were the most common symp-
toms. Considering the fact that EVD is a disease with
non-specific symptoms, these can pose as a dilemma in EVD
outbreak foci because paediatric EVD clinical features are
similar to those of other common childhood infections. In
order to mitigate a potentially high risk of nosocomial infec-
tions in non-EVD cases that present themselves with symp-
toms compliant with EVD case definitions in vigor, criteria
that are discriminative in terms of both probability of true
positive cases and of level of adverse outcome would serve
as a valuable individualized risk assessment. Some of our
findings on the clinical symptoms of paediatric Ebola cases
are different from those for adult EVD cases. Barry et al. re-
corded a high (60.0%) proportion of adult EVD cases with
vomiting compared to ours (41.0%); as well as a statistically
significant increase in the odds of dying for adult EVD cases
who presented with bleeding at the time of admission (p =
0.001) [43]. Our study reported that the odds of dying from
bleeding for paediatric EVD cases were not statistically sig-
nificant (p > 0.05). Ohuabunwo et al. reported a high (30.0%)
proportion of adult EVD cases with bleeding [44]; ours was
7.2%. Barry et al. also reported lower proportions for diar-
rhoea (34.0%) and muscle pain (23.0%) for adult Ebola cases
[43] compared to ours for paediatric EVD cases (diarrhoea =
71.3%, muscle pain = 97.8%). The proportion of adult EVD
cases presenting with anorexia reported by Ohuabunwo
et al. was also lower (55.0%) [44] than ours (99.3%). We re-
corded a higher (98.6%) proportion of paediatric EVD cases
who presented with chest pain than those reported by Dalla-
tomasina S et al. (44.0%) for adult EVD cases [2]. We also re-
ported a 100% CFR (p = 0.05) for paediatric EVD patients
who presented with skin rash (maculopapular rash) at the
time of admission but this feature was not prominent among
adult EVD cases during the 2014–2016 West African EVD
outbreak [45].
One limitation of our study is the lack of follow up to
determine the outcome of paediatric EVD cases that
Page 8
Kangbai et al. BMC Infectious Diseases (2019) 19:81  Page 8 of 9
were released alive which may have revealed late mortal-
ity. Additionally, considering that our medical records
did not capture the viral load of EVD patients at the
time of their admission and the date of EVD onset as de-
termined by the appearance of EVD signs and symp-
toms, we were thus unable to determine the effect of
treatment delay and viral load on EVD treatment out-
come. The findings of our facility-based EVD patient
treatment outcomes have to be seen in the context of a
specialized treatment facility that was located in the
heart of a country’s capital, therefore the potential exter-
nal validity of our findings has to be taken with caution.
Our logistic model has an ROC with a high AUC of
0.94 to discriminate between paediatric EVD patients
who were cured from those who died during treatment
by using the characteristics sex of the patient, reported
abdominal pain, vomiting, difficulty in breathing or
showing signs of conjunctivitis at the time of admission.
An individual’s high risk of dying as implied by our
model would as a consequence justify prompt and inten-
sified treatment, which may be a scarce resource during
peak periods of an ongoing outbreak.
Conclusions
Our study identified both epidemiological and clinical fea-
tures that were associated with EVD infection, CFRs as
well as those that are significant predictors for paediatric
EVD treatment outcome. We reported that slightly more
females were infected with EVD compared to males and
that EVD cases below 5 years of age, as well as those cases
that reported difficulty in breathing, difficulty in swallow-
ing, signs of conjunctivitis and those with Stage 3 EVD in-
fection at the time of admission recorded higher CFRs
compared to the other paediatric EVD cases without these
criteria. Additionally, we observed that male paediatric
EVD patients, paediatric EVD patient who reported ab-
dominal pain, difficulty in breathing, vomiting and showed
signs of conjunctivitis at the time of admission tended to
have increased odds of dying during EVD treatment. Our
model suggests an adapted set of criteria for case defini-
tions that would allow a differentiated approach to clinical
management that can be assumed to be beneficial to a
subgroup of paediatric patients at high risk of dying in the
course of treatment. We are also suggesting the formula-
tion of a separate paediatric EVD case definition to handle
the dissimilarities in CFRs and clinical symptoms between
childhood EVD cases and adult EVD cases and to facilitate
discrimination from other childhood diseases that have
similar clinical symptoms like those of paediatric EVD.
