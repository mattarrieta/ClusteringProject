An assessment of Ebola-related stigma and
its association with informal healthcare
utilisation among Ebola survivors in Sierra
Leone: a cross-sectional study

Abstract
Background: We examined the magnitude and correlates of Ebola virus disease (EVD)-related stigma among EVD
survivors in Sierra Leone since their return to their communities. In addition, we determined whether EVD-related
stigma is a predictor of informal health care use among EVD survivors.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 358 EVD survivors in five districts across all four geographic
regions (Western Area, Northern Province, Eastern Province and Southern Province) of Sierra Leone. Ebola-related
stigma was measured by adapting the validated HIV related stigma for people living with HIV/AIDS instrument. We
also measured traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) use (as a measure of informal healthcare use). Data
were analysed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis.
Results: EVD survivors report higher levels of internalised stigma (0.92 ± 0.77) compared to total enacted stigma
(0.71 ± 0.61). Social isolation (0.96 ± 0.88) was the highest reported enacted stigma subscale. Ebola survivors who
identified as Christians [AOR = 2.51, 95%CI: 1.15–5.49, p = 0.021], who perceived their health to be fair/poor [AOR =
2.58, 95%CI: 1.39–4.77. p = 0.003] and who reside in the northern region of Sierra Leone [AOR = 2.80, 95%CI: 1.29–
6.07, p = 0.009] were more likely to experience internalised stigma. Verbal abuse [AOR = 1.95, 95%CI: 1.09–3.49, p =
0.025] and healthcare neglect [AOR = 2.35, 95%CI: 1.37–4.02, p = 0.002] were independent predictors of T&CM use
among EVD survivors.
Conclusion: Our findings suggest EVD-related stigma (internalised and enacted) is prevalent among EVD survivors
since their return to their communities. Religiosity, perceived health status and region were identified as independent
predictors of internalised stigma. Verbal abuse and healthcare neglect predict informal healthcare use. EVD survivor-
centred and community-driven anti-stigma programs are needed to promote EVD survivors’ recovery and community
re-integration.

Background
The 2014–2016 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in
West Africa is considered the largest and unprecedented
public health emergency in the history of the disease [1].
As at the 30th March 2016, the morbidity and mortality
figures due to EVD were estimated at 28, 646 and 11,
322 respectively [2].  The West African Ebola outbreak
also recorded the highest number of survivors, and
current estimates put the number of EVD survivors at
more than 10,000 [3].  Many EVD survivors are known
to be suffering from short and long-term physical symp-
toms and mental complications as a result of surviving
EVD [4–6]. Psychosocial consequences of EVD survivor-
ship can be traumatic, due to the adverse psychological
experiences of individuals with EVD had to grapple with
during infection, treatment and post-discharge. These
adverse experiences includes various forms of psycho-
social challenges such as depression, anxiety and grief
due to loss of loved ones and stigma [4].
Stigma constitutes negative attitudes and beliefs that
discredit an individual or group of individuals leading to
prejudice and societal exclusion [7]. Stigma can lead to ex-
periences and feelings of blame, shame, worthlessness,
loneliness, isolation, social exclusion and discrimination in
accessing social amenities and healthcare services [8, 9].
Socially undesirable manifestations (prejudice and dis-
crimination) expressed against those with the stigmatizing
attributes are known as enacted stigma whereas the feeling
of shame, guilt or worthlessness experienced as a result of
having the stigmatising attribute is referred to as interna-
lised stigma [10]. EVD-related stigma is largely based on
community fear that EVD survivors are still contagious
[11]. Such fear is profound if EVD survivors experience
post-Ebola sequelae [12, 13] or are aware that the Ebola
virus can be present in certain immune-protective parts of
the body after convalescence (for example, the semen,
breast milk, ocular (eye) fluid, and spinal column fluid)
[14, 15]. EVD-related stigma has led to EVD survivors be-
ing mocked by their communities [16, 17], being evicted
from their homes by their property owners [13, 17], losing
their former jobs [11] and being divorced by their spouses
[12, 13]. Some EVD survivors have been prevented from
visiting public places such as public toilets and have expe-
rienced difficulty in trading commodities at their local
market due to a community reluctance to touch their
items or money [12, 13]. EVD-related stigma has been re-
ported by EVD survivors and their communities in DR
Congo (35%), Guinea (26%) and Liberia (3%) [18–20], and
may be more common among female rather than male
EVD survivors [12].  Other factors, which have been re-
ported as predictors of EVD-related stigma, are age, level
of education, and having accessed medical care [21]. Li-
berian research also suggests EVD survivors are reported
to be more likely to experience stigma compared to their 
close contacts who were not infected with EVD virus [22]
however the degree of EVD-related stigma may decline
among survivors over time [21, 23]. In Sierra Leone, stig-
matisation is reported in approximately one third of EVD
survivors [24, 25].
Stigma associated with infectious disease has been
linked to poor adherence to conventional treatment and
the utilization of informal or non-integrated forms of
health care such as traditional and complementary medi-
cine (T&CM) [26, 27].  T&CM refers to a number of
health systems, products and practices considered to be
predominantly outside conventional medical practice
and the medical curriculum [28, 29]. In sub-Saharan Af-
rica, an average of 58% of the general population is esti-
mated to use T&CM products and 29% consult T&CM
practitioners [30]. The key reasons for T&CM use in Af-
rica have been attributed to its low cost, easy accessibil-
ity, the alignment between T&CM philosophy and local
cultural and religious values, perceived safety and effi-
cacy, and dissatisfaction with conventional medicine
[30]. In Sierra Leone, T&CM utilisation is common es-
pecially among hypertensive, pregnant women, infertile
women, and lactating mothers and in the management
of malaria and diarrhoea [31–36]. Studies have reported
individuals with HIV/AIDS or mental health diagnoses
that experience stigma are more likely to access T&CM
services [37, 38]. This pattern of use is reportedly due to
the users’ perception of T&CM as less stigmatizing than
conventional medicine, partly justified by the view that
these T&CM approaches are deeply rooted in the local
cultural and traditional practices [37, 38]. Among SARS
survivors, T&CM was reported to be useful in overcoming
SARS-related stigmas by creating new social support net-
works and counteracting potential future stigmatization
and discrimination [39].
Most studies on stigma among EVD survivors have fo-
cussed on its magnitude and nature both immediately fol-
lowing and over a number of years after discharge from
an Ebola treatment centre [11–13, 17–21, 23, 25, 40]. Al-
though recent studies have reported the use of informal
healthcare services among EVD survivors [41, 42],  glo-
bally, no study to date has reported whether EVD-related
stigma is associated with T&CM utilisation among EVD
survivors. In addition, none of the published studies in Si-
erra Leone on EVD survivors has explored the sociodemo-
graphic and health-related factors associated with EVD-
related stigma. Such associations are important, as they
will inform the design and implementation of future anti-
stigma interventions. Therefore, we examined the magni-
tude and the sociodemographic and health related corre-
lates of enacted and internalised stigma among EVD
survivors in Sierra Leone since their return to their com-
munities. In addition, our study determined whether
enacted and internalised stigma are possible predictors of

informal healthcare service utilisation (T&CM use) among
EVD survivors in Sierra Leone.
Methods
Study design, setting and participants
We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire study be-
tween January and August 2018 among EVD survivors
across all four geographic regions (Western Area, North-
ern Province, Eastern Province and Southern Province)
of Sierra Leone. Participants in this study were adult
EVD survivors aged 18 years and older experiencing
post-Ebola sequelae. We excluded EVD survivors whose
physical and psychological health limited them from
providing information, such as those survivors with
memory loss, hearing loss, high fever and bleeding or
those experiencing acute emotional distress.
Sampling method
A sample of 351 EVD survivors was determined using a
sample size formula for cross-sectional studies (N = z2pq/
d2).  We increased our sample to 400 to make up non-
responses. Multistage sampling method was used to re-
cruit participants across the country. Data was collected 
from the four geographic regions of Sierra Leone (West-
ern Area, Northern province, Southern province and East-
ern province). Five districts were purposefully selected to
cover all four geographic regions of the country. The loca-
tion of the five districts in Sierra Leone are shown in Fig. 1.
The five districts are western area urban and western area
rural districts (both in the Western area),  Bo district
(Southern province),  Kenema district (Eastern province)
and Bombali district (Northern province). These five dis-
tricts were chosen based on the epidemiological profile of
the total confirmed Ebola cases and because they are host
to the highest number of Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone.
We randomly sampled the required number of EVD survi-
vors in all five districts based on proportional representa-
tion using the national list of registered Ebola survivors
obtained from the Sierra Leone Association of Ebola sur-
vivors (SLAES).  Survivors who were randomly chosen
were invited to participate in the study via telephone.
Measures
Demographics and health related characteristics
The survey instrument measures EVD demographics
such age, sex, marital status, educational status, religious

affiliation, employment status, financial status, place of
residence (urban/rural),  geographical region (north,
south, east regions and western area) and time (months)
since post-discharge. Perceived health status was mea-
sured using a five-point Likert scale that ranged from
“excellent” to “poor”. EVD survivors were asked if they
had been diagnosed with any chronic condition prior to
being infected with EVD virus.
Ebola-related stigma
The Ebola-related stigma instrument was adapted from
the HIV-related stigma for people living with HIV/AIDS
(HASI-P). The HASI-P is a validated 33-item scale that
measures stigma among HIV/AIDS patients in the past
3 months [43].  This instrument was validated among
HIV/AIDS patients in five African countries: Lesotho,
Malawi, South Africa, Swaziland and Tanzania. It con-
sists of the following subscales and this includes verbal
abuse (eight items, α = 0.886); healthcare neglect (seven
items, α = 0.832);  social isolation (five items, α = 0.890);
fear of contagion (six items, α = 0.795);  and workplace
stigma (two items, α = 0.758) all of which measures
enacted stigma. The final subscale called negative self-
perception (five items, α = 0.906) measures internalised
stigma [43]. We decided to use HIV/AIDS related stigma
scale (HASI-P) because HIV/AIDS patients share similar
psychosocial challenges with EVD survivors in terms of
social isolation, fear of contagion and family and com-
munity stigma and discrimination [44]. In addition, there
is widespread misinformation about HIV/AIDS and
EVD. For instance, EVD and HIV/AIDS only affects cer-
tain groups of people in society (the poor for EVD and
promiscuous adults or homosexuals for HIV/AIDS) and
the unfounded community fear of being infected with
the virus through means that have not being scientific-
ally proven [44].  To adapt to our setting, the HASI-P
was reviewed by two experts in sociology and EVD as
well as piloted among 10 EVD survivors. Based on their
feedback, we decided to remove the two items that
measure workplace stigma since the majority of EVD
survivors did not have any paid job before or after EVD.
We also removed the statement “At the hospital, I was
left in soiled bed” from the healthcare neglect subscale
since majority of survivors were not admitted at the
clinic/hospital. In addition, the wording of some state-
ments were changed to fit the local EVD survivorship
context. Further, we decided to assess stigma experi-
enced by EVD survivors since their discharged from
Ebola treatment centre instead of the past 3 months, as
was the case when the instrument was validated among
HIV/AIDS patients [43].  The final adapted HASI-P in-
strument used in our study is attached as an
Additional file 1. 
Use of traditional and complementary medicine
EVD survivors were asked about their health care utilisa-
tion, including whether they have used T&CM treatment
(products and practitioners) since their discharge from
the ETC. The common T&CM modalities considered in
our study were informed by studies undertaken previ-
ously in Sierra Leone [31–33, 35, 45–47] and across Af-
rica [30]. We considered T&CM in our study to include
biological based therapy (herbal medicine and animal ex-
tract), spiritual therapy (prayer/faith healing), alternative
medicine systems (Chinese herbal medicine, and acu-
puncture),  and physical therapy/body manipulations
(massage therapy, traditional bone setting).
Data collection and ethical consideration
Trained data collectors obtained the relevant informa-
tion from EVD survivors using self-administered or
interviewer-administered (for illiterate participants) for-
mats. The University of Technology Sydney Human Re-
search Ethics Committee (UTS-HREC-ETH17–2080)
and the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Com-
mittee granted ethical clearance. A participant informa-
tion sheet, explaining the purpose and scope of the
study, as well as the option to opt out, was given or read
(illiterate) to EVD survivors before seeking their consent
to participate. Survivors signing or thumb printing the
consent form was interpreted as their willingness to par-
ticipate. Survivors who signed or thumbed printed (for
illiterate participants) the consent form were then given
the questionnaire to fill or to be interviewed(for illiterate
participants).Three hundred and fifty eight EVD survi-
vors consented and completely filled the questionnaire
and were included in the data analysis. We collected our
data between May and August 2018 and it was done ei-
ther at the regional office of EVD survivors or their
homes or the village courtyard.
Data analysis
We used IBM SPSS Statistics version 25 to perform all
analyses. Each of the 30 stigma items was assigned a
score of 0 to 3 (0 = never, 1 = once or twice, 2 = several
times and 3 = most of the time). For each participant, we
summed the scores and divided by the number of items
to get the mean score for each of the factors/subscales.
To obtain the overall total stigma mean score, we
summed up the mean scores of each of the factors and
divided by 30. Stigma was analysed as a binary variable
(yes/no). Mean stigma score of zero means that none of
the items (experiences) in each of the subscales (interna-
lised stigma, verbal abuse, healthcare neglect, fear of
contagion and social isolation) occurred since discharged
from the ETC. A mean stigma score greater than zero
indicated that at least one of the items in each of the
subscales occurred once or twice or several times or
Page 5
James et al. BMC Public Health (2020) 20:182  Page 5 of 12
most of the time. As a binary variable, mean score of zero
was taken as the absence of stigma and greater than zero
was taken present of stigma. We employed chi-square and
Fischer exact two tailed tests to determine the association
between stigma subscales and sociodemographic and
health related variables. We conducted a backward step-
wise regressions analysis to establish the most parsimoni-
ous model that determines the sociodemographic and
health related predictors of internal and enacted stigma.
We also used backward stepwise regressions analysis to
establish the most parsimonious model that predicts
whether internal and enacted stigma is an independent
predictor of informal healthcare use (T&CM use). To de-
termine the independent association between EVD –re-
lated stigma and T&CM use, all of the sociodemographic
(age, sex, marital status, religious affiliation, employment
status residence etc.) and health related (perceived health
status, Duration(years) since discharged from ETC, known
chronic disease) variables were taken as potential co-
founders and were adjusted for in the regression analysis.
Probability less than 0.05 was as statistically significant for
all inferential statistical analyses.
Results
Out of the 400 survivors invited to participate in the study,
377 of them agreed to take part in the study. However, 19
failed to completely fill the questionnaire. Thus, complete
data on 358 EVD survivors were analysed. Table 1 gives a
summary of EVD survivors’ sociodemographic and health-
related characteristics. More than half (n = 194, 54.2%) of
survivors were within the ages of 18–33 years and close to
two-thirds (n = 223, 62.3%) were females. Also close to
three –fourths (n = 262, 73.2%) of survivors perceived
their health to be fair/poor.
Stigma experienced by EVD survivors
Based on the calculated mean scores, EVD survivors re-
ported higher levels of internalised stigma (0.92 ± 0.77)
compared to enacted stigma (0.71 ± 0.61).  Among the
enacted stigma subscale, social isolation (0.96 ± 0.88) and
healthcare neglect (0.46 ± 0.53) were the highest and least
respectively. We categorised stigma scores into (yes /no)
as there was little variability in stigma scores. In general,
majority of Ebola survivors endorsed at least one item ex-
ploring internalised stigma (n = 298, 83.2%) and any of the
three subscales measuring enacted stigma (n = 333, 93%).
Verbal abuse (n = 276, 77.1%) and fear of contagion (n =
225, 62.8%) were the highest and least reported enacted
stigma subscales respectively (see Table 2).

enacted stigma. After adjusting for possible cofounders
through regression analysis, Ebola survivors who were
Christians [AOR = 2.51, 95%CI: 1.15–5.49, p = 0.021], who
perceived their health to fair/poor were [AOR = 2.58,
95%CI: 1.39–4.77. p = 0.003] and who reside in the north-
ern region of Sierra Leone [AOR = 2.80, 95%CI: 1.29–6.07,
p = 0.009] were more likely to experience internalised
stigma (see Table 4). No sociodemographic and health re-
lated variables predicted total enacted stigma. Table 5
summarizes the independent association between the indi-
vidual subscales of the enacted stigma and sociodemo-
graphic and health related variables. Ebola survivors who
reside in the urban area were more likely [AOR = 2.7,
95%CI: 1.57–4.66, p < 0.001] and those who live in the
Northern Region of Sierra Leone were less likely [AOR =
0.37, 95%CI: 0.20–0.69 p = 0.002] to experience verbal
abuse. Survivors residing in the Northern Region com-
pared to those in the Western Area were more likely
[AOR = 2.03, 95%CI: 1.13–3.64, p = 0.018] to experience
healthcare neglect. EVD survivors residing in the Southern
[AOR = 3.11, 95%CI: 1.41–6.83, p = 0.005] and eastern
[AOR = 2.44, 95%CI: 1.19–5.03, p = 0.015] regions were
more likely to be stigmatised due to fear of contagion than
those in the Western area. In addition, EVD survivors in
the Eastern region were more likely [AOR = 3.06, 95%CI:
1.34–7.02, p = 0.008] to be socially isolated than those in
the western area. Unemployed EVD survivors were more
likely [AOR = 2.13, 95%CI: 1.26–3.6, p = 0.005] to be so-
cially isolated than their employed counterparts.
Association between T&CM use and internalised and
enacted stigma
Table 6 presents the independent association between
T&CM use and internalised and enacted stigma using
backwards stepwise binary logistic regression. EVD sur-
vivors who experienced enacted stigma were [AOR =
4.58, 95%CI: 1.51–13.83, p = 0.007] more likely to use
T&CM. Further analysis of the subscales of the enacted
stigma revealed that verbal abuse [AOR = 1.95, 95%CI:
1.09–3.49, p = 0.025} and healthcare neglect [AOR =
2.35, 95%CI: 1.37–4.02, p = 0.002] were independent pre-
dictors of T&CM use among the EVD survivors. 
Internalised stigma was not found to be a predictor of
T&CM use [AOR = 1.93, 95%CI: 0.99–3.75, p = 0.054].
Discussion
This is the first nationally representative study to deter-
mine the prevalence of stigma, its sociodemographic
correlates and association with informal and non-
integrated forms of health care such as T&CM use
among EVD survivors in Sierra Leone. One key finding
from our study is that EVD survivors report high levels
of internalised and enacted stigma since discharge from
an Ebola treatment centre which is in line with findings
from a longitudinal Liberian study that reported high
levels of stigma at baseline but lower levels at subse-
quent follow-up visits [21, 23].  Our finding also reso-
nates with similar short term and smaller sample size
cross-sectional studies in Sierra Leone [24, 25, 48],
Liberia [20], Guinea [49], and DR Congo [19, 40],which
reported that EVD survivors experience several forms of
internalised and enacted stigma. Our result identifies
higher occurrence of internalised stigma when compared
with the occurrence of total enacted stigma experienced
by EVD survivors. Our result contrasts to findings re-
ported in a Liberian longitudinal cohort study that
employed a different stigma instrument [23] but is in
line with a South African study that employed the same
stigma tool to measure stigma among HIV/AIDS pa-
tients to that employed in our study [50]. The higher fre-
quency of internalised stigma (negative self-perception)
among EVD survivors in our study is a cause for con-
cern and warrants further research attention as it can
lead to low self-esteem, low self-efficacy, loss of hope for
the future and can interfere with life goal achievement
[51]. The findings for EVD studies appear to be similar
to some other infectious diseases. For example, similar
sequelae have been reported among HIV/AIDS patients
in Hong Kong [52] and Uganda [53],  in which HIV/
AIDS patients reported to feel less worthy of themselves,
guilt, shame and self-blame for having HIV/AIDS.
The common types of enacted stigma faced by EVD
survivors in our study were social isolation, verbal abuse
and fear of contagion, all of which are congruent with

the common forms of stigma reported by EVD survivors
in the wider literature [6]. These findings may be applic-
able to other emerging infectious disease survivors more
generally, as similar forms of stigma from the public and
healthcare staff have also been reported among SARS
survivors in Hong Kong [54].  Social isolation, verbal 
abuse and fear of contagion can lead to increased levels
of psychological distress, delayed access to medical care,
low adherence to medical therapy and reduced quality of
life as it has also been reported among HIV/AIDS and
mental health patients [55, 56].  Drawing from lessons
learnt from HIV/AIDS-related stigma, several EVD

survivor-centred and community-driven strategies have
been suggested that could contribute to EVD survivors’
recovery and community re-integration. These include
community long-term psychosocial counselling for EVD
survivors to enhance their coping skills, community edu-
cation and social support programs for EVD survivors,
recruitment and training of trusted opinion leaders that
can spread accurate de-stigmatising messages within
communities, minimising social isolation and promoting
economic empowerment of EVD survivors and EVD af-
fected communities [44, 57].
The mental health impact of surviving Ebola is enor-
mous, and previous studies have reported that psycho-
logical distress, anxiety and depression are widespread 
among Ebola survivors [4, 6].  Although the impact of
Ebola –related stigma on mental illness among Ebola
survivors is not well understood, stigma induced psycho-
logical distress and anxiety have been found to be associ-
ated with adverse mental health outcome among HIV/
AIDS patients [58]. Since HIV/AIDS and Ebola virus dis-
ease share similar stigmatizing attributes [44], it is pos-
sible that Ebola –related stigma maybe contributing to
the mental health complications among Ebola survivors.
Thus, it likely that stigma reduction strategies will help
reduce the mental health burden among EVD survivors.
EVD survivors in our study who identified as Chris-
tians and reside in the northern region were more likely
to experience internalised stigma. The reasons for the

high levels of internalised stigma among Christians remain
unclear. Going forward, an in-depth ethnography study
would be required to explain the high levels of internalised
stigma amongst Christians compared to Muslims that was
observed in our study. Our study findings also reveal that
EVD survivors who perceive their health to be fair/poor
are more likely to experience internalised stigma than
those who perceive their health to be good. In HIV/AIDS
patients, the link between stigma and perceived poor
health status is postulated to be because stigma is known
to promote poor adherence to treatment, lowers emo-
tional coping and social support networks and reduces ac-
cess to and usage of health and social services leading to
poor health outcomes [26, 38]. The similarity of our find-
ings suggest that similar concerns may be present for
EVD survivors. Further studies are needed to explore the
link between internalised stigma and religiosity as well as
perceived poor health status among EVD survivors in Si-
erra Leone. Nonetheless, our results have revealed that re-
ligiosity, perceived health status and spatial location are
potential predictors of internalised stigma among EVD
survivors and, that healthcare provider and social workers
should consider these characteristics as possible risk fac-
tors for internalised stigma among EVD survivors in Sierra
Leone.
Further analysis of the enacted stigma subscales re-
vealed verbal abuse was more likely to occur among
EVD survivors residing in urban locations when com-
pared to those living in rural areas. Our finding may be
explained by the fact that adherence to local bylaws to
prevent stigma and discrimination by the community
was more prevalent in rural areas compared to urban
areas [59].  Also, previously identified urban-rural com-
munity differences in knowledge and perception of, and
attitude towards, EVD may also explain our finding [60].
Our study also revealed that EVD survivors who are un-
employed were more likely to be socially isolated by 
their communities than their counterparts who were
employed. Such a finding maybe explained given that
unemployed EVD survivors are likely to be economically
and socially dependent on their families and their com-
munities for their wellbeing and, as such are more likely
to experience stigma in the form of isolation from their
families and communities compared to employed EVD
survivors [17, 61].
EVD survivors who experienced healthcare neglect in
conventional healthcare settings in our study were more
likely to use T&CM. Our finding is not surprising given
that healthcare neglect (negative attitude of healthcare
providers, long waiting time or being the last person to
be seen by the doctor) leads to patient’s dissatisfaction
with conventional healthcare - a key driver for T&CM
use in the general and sub-health populations in Africa
[30]. Thus, it is important for policy makers and health
providers to bear in mind that, like other sub-health
populations, EVD survivors will likely seek informal
healthcare options if they feel neglected by the conven-
tional health system. At policy level, laws are needed
that allow EVD survivors to receive appropriate care in a
safe environment without being stigmatised or discrimi-
nated. In addition, educational interventions to change
the negative attitude towards EVD survivors among
health providers are required. However, there were also
positive attributes identified for T&CM use. The high
rate of T&CM use among EVD survivors who experi-
enced enacted stigma (healthcare neglect and verbal
abuse) maybe related to the notion that T&CM may
serve as a stigma reduction strategy. For instance,
T&CM has been used by patients to resist the terminal
understanding of HIV/AIDS and believing that HIV/
AIDS is chronic rather than a terminal illness [27]. Also,
HIV/AIDS patients and SARS survivors have used
T&CM practices such as yoga and Tai Chi to create so-
cial support groups as people in such settings are less
Page 10
James et al. BMC Public Health (2020) 20:182  Page 10 of 12
likely to act differently to each other since they share
similar health status and experiences [27, 39].  Drawing
from the experiences of HIV/AIDS patients and SARS
survivors in using T&CM in managing stigma, it is pos-
sible that EVD survivors will be using T&CM not only
to address their physical health needs but also to as a
coping mechanism against the stigma they are experien-
cing in their communities and at healthcare facilities. As
such, there may be a role for integration of some T&CM
– where appropriate – to help improve conventional
health options for EVD survivors. Going forward, well-
designed qualitative research is required to have a dee-
per understanding of the meanings of T&CM practice in
the everyday lives of EVD survivors.
Limitations
The following limitations must be considered when
interpreting our findings. First, our study may suffer
from recall bias as we relied entirely on self-reported
data. Second, our study employed a cross-sectional de-
sign and, therefore we cannot infer causality between in-
dependent and outcomes variables. Third, we adapted
the HIV/AIDS-related stigma scale (HASI-P) [43] to
measure EVD related stigma among EVD survivors, as
there is no detailed or validated tool exist for EVD re-
lated stigma. We decided to use HIV/AIDS related
stigma scale (HASI-P) because HIV/AIDS share similar
characteristics with EVD in terms of social isolation, fear
of contagion and family and community stigma and dis-
crimination [44]. Finally, our findings are only applicable
to EVD survivors in Sierra Leone and may not be repre-
sentative of EVD survivors in other neighbouring EVD
affected countries. Nevertheless, the national nature of
this survey represents one of the most representative
samples of stigma in EVD survivors.
Conclusion
The majority of EVD survivors in Sierra Leone experi-
ence both internalised and enacted Ebola-related stigma
although internalised stigma was the most common in
terms of occurrence. To reduce EVD related stigma, and
the impacts of such stigma on EVD survivors’ health and
wellbeing, EVD outbreak responses should include EVD
survivor-centred and community-driven interventions
that can help contribute to EVD survivors’ recovery and
community re-integration. EVD survivors appear drawn
to informal and non-integrated care (T&CM) via both
push (i.e. dissatisfaction with conventional care) and pull
(i.e. empowerment and social commitments from
T&CM).  Future research is needed to have a deeper
insight of the meanings of T&CM practice in the every-
day lives of EVD survivors.
