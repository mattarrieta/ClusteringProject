Abstract 
Background:  In-depth examination of the plasma proteomic response to infection with a wide variety of pathogens
can assist in the development of new diagnostic paradigms, while providing insight into the interdependent patho-
genic processes which encompass a host’s immunological and physiological responses. Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a
highly lethal infection termed Ebola virus disease (EVD) in primates and humans. The Gram negative non-spore form-
ing bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp) causes melioidosis in primates and humans, characterized by severe pneu-
monia with high mortality. We sought to examine the host response to infection with these two bio-threat pathogens
using established animal models to provide information on the feasibility of pre-symptomatic diagnosis, since the
induction of host molecular signaling networks can occur before clinical presentation and pathogen detection.
Methods:  Herein we report the quantitative proteomic analysis of plasma collected at various times of disease
progression from 10 EBOV-infected and 5 Bp-infected nonhuman primates (NHP). Our strategy employed high
resolution LC–MS/MS and a peptide-tagging approach for relative protein quantitation. In each infection type, for
all proteins with > 1.3 fold abundance change at any post-infection time point, a direct comparison was made with
levels obtained from plasma collected daily from 5 naïve rhesus macaques, to determine the fold changes that were
significant, and establish the natural variability of abundance for endogenous plasma proteins.
Results:  A total of 41 plasma proteins displayed significant alterations in abundance during EBOV infection, and 28
proteins had altered levels during Bp infection, when compared to naïve NHPs. Many major acute phase proteins
quantitated displayed similar fold-changes between the two infection types but exhibited different temporal dynam-
ics. Proteins related to the clotting cascade, immune signaling and complement system exhibited significant differen-
tial abundance during infection with EBOV or Bp, indicating a specificity of the response.
Conclusions:  These results advance our understanding of the global plasma proteomic response to EBOV and Bp 
infection in relevant primate models for human disease and provide insight into potential innate immune response
differences between viral and bacterial infections.

Background
Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a highly virulent systemic
disease, Ebola virus disease (EVD) that results in hem-
orrhagic fever (in both primates and humans) with high
fatality rates. Outbreaks of EVD occur primarily in Sub-
Saharan Africa, and EBOV (formerly designated as Zaire
ebolavirus) is responsible for the largest number of out-
breaks of the five known members of the Ebolavirus
genus, including the first documented outbreak which
occurred in 1976, and the largest outbreak which started
in 2013 and was finally contained in 2015 (est. 28,000
cases) [1, 2]. In humans, the general symptomatic pro-
file of EVD resembles that of malaria, yellow fever, Lassa
fever and typhoid fever, which are also endemic to Sub-
Saharan Africa, thus complicating diagnosis and contain-
ment efforts [3]. Although PCR-based blood diagnostic
methods have been improved to detect the presence of
EBOV RNA, most PCR-based assays do not reach reli-
able detection levels until 72 h after infection, depending
on viral load [4], and a negative PCR in the first 3 days of
illness onset does not exclude EBOV infection.
NHP models of EBOV infection have provided the
most informative data related to the pathology and host
response. In rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and cynomol-
gus (Macaca fascicularis) macaques infected with 1000
PFU of EBOV (intramuscular route), viremia is initially
detected 3–4 days after infection, often coinciding with
a febrile response [5, 6].  Monocytes/macrophages and
dendritic cells are the first cell types that are infected; 
virus then spreads to the regional lymph nodes, liver and
spleen by the movement of infected cells and free virus
into the bloodstream. Lymphopenia, thrombocytope-
nia, neutrophilia and coagulopathy develop as EVD pro-
gresses [7, 8] along with a pro-inflammatory cytokine/
chemokine response [9].
Melioidosis is an illness caused by the soil-dwelling
Gram negative non-spore forming bacillus Burkholde-
ria pseudomallei (Bp) which afflicts both humans and
animals [10].  Most cases originate in Southeast Asia
and Northern Australia where it is a common cause of
pneumonia, likely due to aerosolization during mon-
soon rainfall [11]. A low infectious dose by the aerosol
route with the potential for rapid, severe and frequently
fatal pneumonia makes Bp a bio-threat that necessitates
rapid diagnostic strategies. Melioidosis has varied clinical
presentations in both humans and non-human primates, 
including asymptomatic infection, localized skin ulcers/
abscesses, chronic pneumonia, and fulminant septic
shock with abscesses in multiple internal organs [12, 13].
Treatment of melioidosis is difficult, due to the fact that
Bp is naturally resistant to multiple antibiotics and pro-
longed antibiotic treatment (5–6 months) is necessary to
prevent relapse. 
Although there is no universally accepted NHP model
for melioidosis, upon aerosol exposure with Bp,  rhe-
sus macaques develop progressive pneumonia and
sepsis similar to the disease course in humans [14, 15].
The infection can be lethal in rhesus macaques, but
like humans, NHPs vary greatly in their response to Bp 
infection and many develop sub-acute pneumonia. Bp 
is an intracellular pathogen that can multiply within
phagocytes, including neutrophils, monocytes and mac-
rophages without activating a bactericidal response [16, 
17]. Localized disease, such as pneumonia and abscesses
are typical in both human cases and the NHP model; 
however, Bp can spread to secondary sites, including
liver, spleen and brain, or to the blood, and often results
in chronic persistent infection [18, 19]. There have been
few reports examining the transcriptomic or proteomic
response to melioidosis in humans [20–22].
Characterizing the host response to infection theoreti-
cally holds promise for pre-symptomatic diagnosis, since
the induction of host molecular signaling networks often
occurs before clinical presentation and pathogen detec-
tion [23]. Specifically, analyzing changes in host gene and
protein expression during infection can generate patho-
gen-specific biomarker profiles, as different infectious
agents may elicit distinct responses. The interrogation of
the circulatory host response to EBOV or Bp infection in
humans has been performed on a small number of sam-
ples, and is further complicated by supportive care treat-
ments [24–27]. Therefore, the use of comparable NHP
models is necessary for the characterization of the plasma
proteomic response. Furthermore, in-depth examination
of the host response to various pathogenic organisms
generates information that extends beyond simple diag-
nosis, especially in the context of animal model devel-
opment and therapeutic evaluation. For example, 
blood-based host response markers of infection (genetic
or protein-based) can be used to better define pathogen-
esis, stratify disease states and define specific trigger-to-
treat paradigms for new therapeutic treatments in animal
models of infection. Furthermore the examination of the
temporal kinetics of the host response during infection
provides data related to virulence determination allowing
for the down-selection of strains or isolates used as chal-
lenge material for animal model studies.
To track and characterize plasma proteomic host
response dynamics, we examined serially collected sam-
ples from 10 rhesus macaques during EBOV infection
and 5 rhesus macaques during Bp infection. Our strategy
employed high resolution LC–MS/MS and a peptide-
tagging approach for relative protein quantitation. These
studies provide a detailed characterization of the blood-
based host proteomic response profile to EBOV and Bp 
infection in NHP models which approximate EVD and

melioidosis in humans, and highlight the differences
in the innate immune response to a lethal viral versus a
pathogenic bacteria.
Materials and methods
Animal use and ethics statement
All NHP studies were conducted under an IACUC-
approved protocol in compliance with the Animal Wel-
fare Act, PHS Policy, and other Federal statutes and
regulations relating to animals and experiments involving
animals. The facility where this research was conducted is
accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accred-
itation of Laboratory Animal Care, International and
adheres to principles stated in the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 
2011. Research was conducted under IACUC-approved
protocols in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, 
PHS Policy, and other Federal statutes and regulations
relating to animals and experiments involving animals.
EBOV infection
Ten adult rhesus macaques (6 male and 4 female, weight
4.7–5.6 kg, average age 4.2 years) were inoculated with a
target titer of 1000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of EBOV
(H.sapiens-tc/COD/1995/Kikwit-9510621 (15) demon-
strated to be primarily the 8U variant at the mRNA edit-
ing site) in 0.5 mL by intramuscular (IM) injection in the
left or right quadricep. These animals served as control
animals in therapeutic studies, and the samples were ret-
rospectively analyzed to characterize the proteomic host
response to EBOV infection. In all animals, plasma col-
lection occurred on Day 0 (pre-infection) and Days 2, 3, 
4, 5 and 6 post-infection. All EBOV studies were con-
ducted in Animal Biosafety Level 4 containment. Begin-
ning on Day 0 and continuing for the duration of the
in-life phase, clinical observations were recorded, and
animals were closely monitored for disease progression. 
Moribund animals were humanely euthanized based on
institutional-approved clinical scoring and pre-deter-
mined endpoints.
EBOV RT‑PCR
For quantitative assessment of viral RNA, whole blood
was collected using a K3EDTA Greiner Vacuette tube
(or equivalent) and centrifuged at 2500 (± 200) rela-
tive centrifugal force for 10 ± 2 min. To inactivate virus, 
plasma was treated with 3 parts (300 μl) TriReagent LS
and samples were transferred to frozen storage (− 60 °C
to − 90 °C),  until removal for RNA extraction. Carrier
RNA and QuantiFast High Concentration Internal Con-
trol (Qiagen) were spiked into the sample before extrac-
tion, according to manufacturer’s instructions. Viral RNA
was eluted in AVE buffer. Each extracted RNA sample was 
tested with the QuantiFast Internal Control RT-PCR RNA
Assay (Qiagen) to evaluate the yield of the spiked-in Quan-
tiFast High Concentration Internal Control. If the internal
control amplified within manufacturer-designated ranges, 
further quantitative analysis of the viral target was per-
formed. RT–PCR was conducted using an ABI 7500 Fast
Dx using primers specific to EBOV glycoprotein. Sam-
ples were run in triplicate. For quantitative assessments, 
the average of the triplicate genomic equivalents (GE) per
reaction were determined and multiplied by 800 to obtain
GE ml−1 plasma. Standard curves were generated using
synthetic RNA. The limits of quantification for this assay
are 8.0 × 104 − 8.0 × 1010 GE ml−1 of plasma.
Bp challenge and bacterial load determination
Rhesus macaques (n = 5 adults, 3 Female, 2 Male, weight
5.7–6.4 kg, average age 4.8 years) were exposed using
a head-only aerosol exposure system, the NHP were
exposed to an average of 346/118 CFU of B. pseudomallei 
HBPUB10134a (dose range: 248–531/71–214 CFU). This
closely approximates the target dose of 400 CFU. All ani-
mals were exposed on the same day. Exposure durations
ranged from 5 to 15 min. The aerosol respiratory depo-
sition fraction was assumed to be 100%. After aerosol
exposure, the head of each animal was wiped with a soap
solution to remove deposited aerosol, and animals were
housed individually under biosafety level 3 conditions. 
To facilitate collection of blood, central venous catheters
(CVC) were placed 15–16 days prior to exposure. Blood
was collected for baseline values and once daily for the
first 7 days post-exposure and plasma collection for pro-
teomic evaluation occurred on Day 0 (pre-infection) and
Days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 post-infection. Animals that sur-
vived the acute infection were monitored for 46–47 days
post-exposure (study endpoint) before euthanization.
Bp bacterial load determination
Two 100 μl samples of whole blood from days 1–7, 14, 21, 
28, 35, 42 post-exposure were plated on 5% Sheep blood
agar to detect bacteremia. Each plate was incubated
at 37 °C for 72 h. Tissue samples from the lung, liver, 
spleen, pancreas and gonads were collected at necropsy
under sterile conditions and cultured for bacteria. Each
tissue sample of approximately 0.25–1.0 g was manually
homogenized in 2 ml PBS and two 100 μl samples were
plated on 5% Sheep blood agar (Thermo-Fisher) to evalu-
ate positive or negative growth.
Naïve NHP plasma collection
Plasma was collected from five uninfected, healthy naïve
rhesus macaques (average age 6 years, average weight
5.3 kg) daily for 9 days to establish a longitudinal set of
samples.

Plasma TMT sample preparation
Plasma samples (6 time points/animal) were first pro-
cessed in BSL-3 or BSL-4 containment by adding 25 µL
SDS-PAGE solubilizing/reducing buffer to 75 µL sam-
ple and heating to 95 °C for 10 min. Samples were then
removed from containment and stored at − 80 °C until
processed by the iFASP method [28].  Briefly, 5 µL of
each inactivated plasma sample was added to 200 µL 8 M
Urea/100 mM Tris–HCL pH 8.5 (Solution UT8) and fil-
tered through a Microcon-30 kDa Centrifugal Filter Unit
with an Ultracel-30 membrane (Millipore, MRCF0R030) 
at 14,000 × G for 15 min. Following several washing steps
with 100 mM Tris pH 8.0, proteins were alkylated with
55 mM Iodoacetamide and digested with 4 µg Trypsin/
Lys-C (Promega, V5071) overnight at 37 °C. TMT 6-Plex
labeling (Thermo Fisher, 90061) was performed directly
on the FASP filters per the manufacturer’s instructions. 
All 6 single labelled samples were then combined at an
equal volume, purified by C18 spin column, dried to
completion by speed-vac and stored at − 20 °C until ana-
lyzed by LC MS/MS.
LC–MS/MS TMT analysis
Sample digests were re-suspended in 240 μL of 0.1% 
formic acid. A Dionex 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo
Scientific) injected 5 μL of each digest onto a pre-
column (C18 PepMap 100, 5 μm particle size, 5 mm
length × 0.3 mm internal diameter) using a flow rate of
10 µL/min. The loading solvent was 0.1% formic acid in
HPLC grade water. Peptides were then loaded onto an
Easy-Spray analytical column (15 cm × 75 um) packed
with PepMap C18, 3 um particle size, 100 A porosity par-
ticles (Thermo Scientific, Inc.). A 2–38% B gradient elu-
tion in 160 min was formed using Pump-A (0.1% formic
acid) and Pump-B (85% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid) 
at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The column eluent was con-
nected to an Easy-Spray source (Thermo Scientific) with
an electrospray ionization voltage of 2.2 kV. An Orbitrap
Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Inc.) with
an ion transfer tube temperature of 300 °C and an S-lens
setting of 55% was used to focus the peptides. A top 10
data dependent MS/MS method was used to select the
10 most abundant ions in a 400–1600 amu survey scan
(120,000 resolution FWHM at m/z 400) with a full AGC
target value of 1e6 ions and a maximum injection time
of 200 ms. Higher Energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) 
MS/MS spectra were acquired at a resolution of 30,000
(FWHM at m/z 400) with an AGC target value of 5e4
ions and a maximum injection time of 200 ms. The isola-
tion width for MS/MS HCD fragmentation was set to 2
Daltons. The normalized HCD Collision energy was 40% 
with an activation time of 0.1 ms. The dynamic exclusion
duration was 30 s. 
Database search and protein quantitation
Acquired MS/MS protein searches were performed with
ProteomeDiscoverer 2.1 Sequest HT (Thermo Scien-
tific) using a Human (taxID 9606) and rhesus macaque
subset of the SwissProt_2017_01_18 database contain-
ing 42,055 sequences, as well as a custom macaque pro-
teome developed at the University of Nebraska Medical
Center. Sources for the custom macaque proteome data-
base included the following: MacaM genome (version 7),
Zimin et al. [78] and NCBI. Variable modifications used
were TMT 6-plex (N-terminal, K),  Carbamyl (KMR),
Methyl (DE), Acetyl (K), Deamidated (NQ), and Oxida-
tion (M). Cysteine carbamidomethylation was specified
as a constant modification. The peptide-level false dis-
covery rate (FDR) was set at 0.1% using Posterior Error
Probability validation. Only proteins having at least 2
Peptide Spectral Matches (PSM) were considered, with
both unique and razor peptides used for protein quan-
titation. Normalization by total peptide amount was
used with control channel average scaling mode turned
on. Mass tolerances were 10 ppm for the MS1 scan and
0.6 Da for all MS/MS scans. Quantitation results were
filtered such that only high-confidence/unambiguous
PSMs having MS2 isolation interference values equal to
or less than 30% were used.
Western blot analysis
Western blot assays were performed using a mouse
monoclonal antibody for galectin-3 binding protein
(LGALS3BP) purchased from Origene (Cat# TA503455).
Briefly, inactivated plasma samples (2 µl) were run under
reducing conditions on a 4–12% precast polyacrylamide
gel (NuPAGE bis–tris Thermo-Fisher Cat# NP0321BOX) 
and transferred to PVDF membranes. Each blot was
blocked overnight with blocking buffer in phosphate
buffered saline (PBS) (Cat# 37572, Thermo-Fisher) and
then incubated with primary antibody against G3BP
(1:500) overnight at 4 °C on a rocking platform. After
washing 3 × with PBS + 0.1% Tween-20 for 5 min, sec-
ondary antibody (1:5000) goat α-mouse ­IRDye® 680
labelled (LICOR) was added and the blots were incubated
an additional hour. The blots were again washed 3 × with
PBST, and then stored in PBS until visualized with an
Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences
Lincoln, NE: model number 9210).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism
for Windows Version 7.00. All plasma protein abun-
dance data from serially collected plasma samples in
response to EBOV or Bp were tested for normality using
the Shapiro–Wilk test and log-transformed to achieve
normal distribution if necessary. An identical test was
Page 5
Ward et al. Clin Proteom (2019) 16:7  Page 5 of 23
performed for the protein abundance data from naïve
NHP. For all protein abundances with fold changes > 1.3
in at least one post-infection time point in 40% of each
cohort, a direct comparison was made to plasma which
was sampled on consecutive days from naïve NHPs to
determine significance using 2-way ANOVA. A p value
of < 0.05 was considered significant. To compare the host-
response between NHPs exposed to EBOV or Bp, protein
abundance ratios were compared for overlapping post-
infection time points (Days 3, 5 and 6/7 PI) using 2-way
ANOVA. An adjustment was performed on all p-values
for multiple comparisons using the two-stage linear step-
up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli and a
false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%. A heat map was gener-
ated which displays the average fold change value of pro-
teins for comparison of the NHP host response to EBOV
or Bp-infection. Each entry was scaled individually to
provide a visual representation of the relative abundance
of each protein.
Results
Sample cohorts
As shown in Fig. 1a, the samples for this study encom-
pass 3 independent cohorts of rhesus macaques: 
EBOV-infected (n = 10), Bp-infected (n = 5), and naïve/
uninfected (n = 5). Each infected NHP sample set con-
tained a total of 6 serially collected plasma samples: 
one pre-infection (Day 0) and 5 post-infection (PI) time
points. Plasma samples from Naïve NHP were collected
daily over a sampling period of 9 days.
Intramuscular infection of rhesus macaques with 1000
PFU of EBOV resulted in all NHPs becoming febrile
between Days 3–5 PI and mortality occurred between
Days 6 and 9 PI. Necropsy findings and gross pathological
changes were consistent with the observations reported
previously for EVD in NHP [30]. All non-surviving ani-
mals had positive plasma viral RNA values by Days 3
or 4 PI (Fig. 1a and Additional file 1: Table S1). Aerosol
infection of rhesus macaques with Bp (~ 400 CFU inhaled
dose) resulted in symptom onset on Day 3 PI in most ani-
mals with acute infection on Days 3–13 PI. Fever (> 1.5 °C
above baseline) was present approximately 30% of the
time beginning on Day 2 PI in Bp-infected NHP. All ani-
mals developed significant pulmonary lesions, with 20% 
mortality (1/5);  the remaining 4/5 animals developed
chronic infection but survived until the study end-point. 
The blood culture results for most animals in this study
were negative (see Additional file 1: Table S2), with the
exception of NHPs JD27 and JH28. By histopathologic
examination, the tissues affected most frequently were
the lung and associated draining lymph nodes, liver and
spleen (see Additional file 1: Table S3). 
Plasma protein quantitation
To characterize the plasma proteomic response to EVD
and melioidosis in rhesus macaques, a semi-quantita-
tive peptide tagging approach was employed to pro-
vide the relative abundance of plasma proteins in an
analytical workflow using LC–MS/MS. For this study, 
we chose not to deplete abundant serum proteins due
to sample volume constraints. Hence, we expected
to identify and quantitate predominately acute phase
reactant proteins which are part of the innate immune
response. Serially collected EBOV-infected plasma
samples were inactivated for removal from Bio-safety
Laboratory level 4 (BSL-4) and processed using the
strategy depicted in Fig. 1b. The Bp- infected samples
were processed in an identical fashion in BSL-3 con-
tainment. On average, a total of 224 ± 36 proteins
were identified in EBOV-infected plasma samples (see
Fig. 2a), and similar protein total averages (218 ± 41) 
were obtained for Bp-infected plasma samples. Pro-
teins identified in each sample were analyzed for
changes in abundance at post-infection time points by
using the pre-infection (Day 0) sample as the baseline
value (assigned a value of 1.0). The ratios of the inten-
sity of the reporter ions associated with the post-infec-
tion time points versus the intensity of the reporter
ion in the pre-infection sample were acquired as rela-
tive peptide abundance. For all proteins with > 1.3 fold
abundance change at any PI time point, a direct com-
parison was made with abundance ratios from 5 naïve
rhesus macaques. This was done to determine the fold
changes that were significant in the infected animals, 
and establish the natural variability of abundance for
endogenous plasma proteins using our FASP/TMT
strategy. For proteins that were not detected in the
Naïve NHP data-set, abundances were considered sig-
nificantly altered if ratios were 2-fold higher or lower
(abundance ratio of 0.5) when compared to the pre-
infection sample at any PI time point. To focus on
the most commonly altered proteins during infection, 
we report the results of significant proteins (as com-
pared to naïve NHP levels where applicable or ≥ two-
fold altered) that were quantitated in at least 40% of
each cohort: 4/10 EBOV-infected NHPs and 2/5 Bp-
infected NHPs. The final number of quantitated pro-
teins in each cohort is shown in Fig. 2a. Proteins with
≥ 2 fold abundance change from pre-infection levels in
at least one post-infection time point during EBOV or
Bp infection in rhesus macaques are shown in Table 1a
(EBOV data) and Table 1b (Bp data) All proteins with
< 2 fold abundance change are listed in Table 2a (EBOV
data) and Table 2b (Bp data).
As seen in Fig. 2a, of the 181 quantified proteins in the
EBOV plasma samples, 19 proteins displayed ≥ 2.0 fold

a Number of proteins quantitated, and number of significant protein alterations in EBOV and Bp-infected plasma samples when compared to naïve
NHP. b–d The relative protein abundances (y-axis) of b alpha-1 anti-trypsin member 3 (A1AT3), c C-reactive protein (CRP), and d serum amyloid A2
(SAA2) detected in plasma during EBOV or Bp infection are plotted versus post-infection day (x-axis). For all three proteins, similar maximum fold
change increases were observed between the two infection types but different temporal kinetics contributed to higher levels observed at Day 3
and Day 6 PI for A1AT3, and Day 3 for CRP and SAA2 in the Bp-infected NHP. Abundance levels that were significantly different from levels found in
naïve NHPs are designated with a black border around the symbol and levels that were significantly different between EBOV- and Bp-infected NHPs
are designated with an asterisk (*). Statistical significance was based on 2-way ANOVA analysis
expression change in 40% of the EBOV cohort. Of those
19 proteins, 8 were not detectable in naïve NHP plasma
(see Table 1a). For the Bp-infected NHPs, a total of 158
proteins were quantitated and of these, 14 proteins exhib-
ited ≥ 2 fold abundance change in 40% of the cohort (2/5
NHPs). Among those 14 proteins, 6 were not detectable
in naïve plasma sets (see Table 1b). Finally, a total of 154
proteins were quantitated in the naïve cohort and none
displayed abundance ratios ≥ 2 fold during the 9-day
sampling period.
As shown in Fig. 2a a total of 41 proteins displayed sig-
nificant alterations in abundance during EBOV infection
when compared to naïve NHPs. This list of 41 proteins 
includes the 11 with abundance changes ≥ 2 fold shown
in Table 1a and 30 additional proteins shown in Table 2a. 
For the Bp cohort, a total of 28 proteins displayed signifi-
cantly changed expression levels when compared to naïve
NHPs (see Tables 1b and 2b). Finally, protein levels for
the EBOV- and Bp-infected plasma sets were compared
for all proteins that exhibited significantly changed abun-
dances on overlapping sample collection days (Day 3, Day
5) and Day 6/7 PI. Proteins which exhibited significantly
different levels during EBOV- versus Bp-infection are
shown in Table 3a, b.

Acute phase plasma proteins with comparable abundance
changes during EBOV or Bp infection
For visualization of the datasets, a heat map was con-
structed using the average fold change values for all pro-
teins which exhibited significant alteration during EBOV
or Bp infection (see Fig. 3). The proteins are divided up
into categories to aid in the reporting of the results and
facilitate the comparison of the NHP plasma proteomic
response to EBOV or Bp infection. The fold change val-
ues for each protein represented in the heat map can be
found in Tables 1a/b and 2a/b. In general many acute
phase plasma proteins were altered to comparable lev-
els during EBOV or Bp infection in NHP. However, we
observed differences in the temporal kinetics of the
proteomic response, in that for most of the quantitated
proteins, the Bp-infected animals displayed abundance
changes 1 day earlier than the EBOV-infected NHP (i.e. 
Day 3 PI vs. Day 4 PI in the EBOV NHP).
Acute phase proteins, such as C-reactive protein
(CRP),  Serum Amyloid A2 (SAA2),  and Lipopolysac-
charide binding protein (LPS-BP) were increased several
fold in both infection types, but were not present at high
enough levels to be quantitated in the naive NHP plasma
samples (see Fig. 2 and Table 1a, b). The major acute
phase proteins Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) members 1
and 3, Haptoglobin, Hemopexin, Alpha-1 acid glycopro-
tein, CRP, and SAA2 reached comparable maximum fold
change values at the common post-infection time-points
between the infection types. However, fold change values 
at the early (Day 3) or late (Day 6/7) PI time-points were
often statistically significant between the two cohorts. 
For example, as shown in Fig. 2b, levels of A1AT3 in the
Bp cohort were significantly higher than levels found in
the EBOV cohort on Day 3 PI, but both infection types
reach similar abundance levels on Day 4/5 PI (see Fig. 3
and Table 1a, b). A1AT3 levels continued to increase in
the EBOV cohort through Day 6 PI but remained rela-
tively static in the Bp cohort. The levels of most positive
acute phase proteins in Bp-infected NHP reached a max-
imum between Days 3–5 PI, at which point they either
plateaued or exhibited decreased abundance. This may
indicate a resolution of the acute response to Bp infec-
tion, since 4/5 Bp-infected animals survived to the end-
point of the study (Day 46 PI). As seen in Fig. 2c, d, CRP
and SAA2 levels rose dramatically in Bp-infected NHP, 
but a decline is observed afterward over the course of the
sampling period. In contrast, in EBOV-infected NHP, lev-
els of SAA and CRP began to increase on Day 3 or 4 PI, 
and reached maximum levels on Day 5 or 6 PI. Overall
a higher amount of variability was observed in the pro-
tein abundance data obtained from the Bp cohort, espe-
cially for CRP and SAA2, indicating a larger variation in
the host response of these animals as compared to the
EBOV-infected cohort. This is in agreement with previ-
ous studies of melioidosis in rhesus macaques and other
NHP species which have reported moderate-to-severe, 
variable disease presentation [24, 26, 27].

Fig. 3  Heat map representing the protein abundance differences observed between EBOV and Bp infection. The protein abundance ratio values
taken from Tables 1a/b and 2a/b were individually scaled to aid in the visualization of the protein abundance differences observed between EBOV
and Bp infected plasma. This was done by assigning the lowest ratio values between the 2 sets to light green and the highest to bright red. As a
result the heat map illustrates the general trending expression of each class of proteins. Proteins designated with an asterisk (*) had levels that were
significantly different based on a 2-way ANOVA test between the two cohorts for at least one common post-infection time-point
In summary, the levels of the major acute phase reac-
tant proteins A1AT1, A1AT3, haptoglobin, hemopexin, 
A1AGP, CRP and SAA2 were increased in response to 
EBOV or Bp infection. In EBOV-infected NHPs, there
was a slightly delayed time dependent increase for
these acute phase reactant proteins, but the change in

abundance was comparable to Bp infected animals. All
plasma proteins with abundance differences between the
two infection types attributed to temporal kinetics are
shown in Table 3b.
Acute phase plasma proteins with differing abundance
levels during EBOV or Bp infection
Fibrinogen is a soluble plasma protein synthesized in
hepatocytes. Three separate genes encode three distinct
polypeptide chains (α, β and γ) forming a homodimer
which circulates in the blood and aids in clot forma-
tion [31].  In diseases associated with vascular disrup-
tion, infection or inflammation, the blood concentration
of fibrinogen increases several fold and is considered
an acute phase protein [45].  Furthermore, an expand-
ing body of evidence suggests that fibrinogen acts as a
mediator of inflammation by interacting with different
cell types through cell-specific receptors to induce spe-
cific inflammatory functions [32]. An increase in Fibrino-
gen α, β, and γ chains was observed in both EBOV- and
Bp-infected NHP plasma. However, the levels of all three
Fibrinogen polypeptides were significantly higher in Bp-
infected NHPs (see Figs. 3 and 4). As seen in Table 1b, 
and Fig. 4a, b, on Day 3 PI Fibrinogen α and β were
increased 2.3 and 1.9 fold respectively in Bp-infected
NHPs, and Fibrinogen γ abundance levels (see Table 2b) 
were increased 1.6 fold. Although Fibrinogen α, β, and γ
levels were also increased in EBOV-infected NHPs (see
Table 2a), the maximum fold change increase was only
≈ 1.4 on Day 5 PI. Not surprisingly, Fibrinogen levels in
the EBOV-infected animals returned to baseline levels 
on Day 6 PI, which is likely a result of Fibrinogen con-
sumption as EVD progresses. As shown in Table 3a, the
increased abundance observed for Fibrinogen α, β, and
γ in the Bp cohort was significantly higher than levels
found in the EBOV NHP cohort for all of the overlapping
time points (Days 3, 5 and 6/7 PI).
Levels of Ceruloplasmin (CP) or ferroxidase were also
higher in Bp-infected animals. CP is an acute phase reac-
tant that increases in concentration in serum/plasma
during infection and inflammation [27, 28]. As shown in
Table 2a, CP abundance increased to significant levels in
the EBOV-infected NHPs on Days 5 and 6 PI. Bp-infected
NHPs displayed a significant increase in abundance on
Days 3 and 5 PI and the level of CP increased to a maxi-
mum of 1.7 fold on Day 9 PI (see Table 2b). CP levels
were significantly higher in the Bp cohort on Day 3 PI
(p = 0.0057) and Day 5 PI (p = 0.0128) when compared to
EBOV-infected NHPs (see Table 3a and Additional file 1: 
Figure S1).
The calcium binding proteins S100A8 and S100A9 are
secreted into circulation by neutrophils and form a het-
erocomplex (calprotectin) which is involved in a wide
range of cellular processes of innate immunity against
microbial invaders [33]. During infection and/or tissue
injury their levels are markedly increased [46, 47]. In
EBOV-infected NHPs, S100A9 was increased 8.43 fold
from pre-infection levels by Day 6 PI, and S100A8 lev-
els increased by 4.95 fold (Table 1a).  A comparison
with the naïve cohort could not be performed since
neither protein was detected in plasma from unin-
fected animals. In the Bp-infected cohort, S100A9 was

quantitated in only 2/5 animals and a maximum fold
change of 5.85 was observed on Day 9 PI (Table 1b). As
seen in Fig. 3, and Additional file 1: Figure S1, in com-
parison with Bp-infected NHPs, S100A9 levels were
significantly higher in EBOV-infected animals on Day
6 PI (Table 3a, p = 0.0253). Unfortunately, S100A8 was
quantitated in only 1 Bp-infected NHP, and a maxi-
mum fold increase of 1.57 was observed on Day 9 PI for
this animal. Therefore, the levels of both S100A8 and
S100A9 were higher in EBOV-infected NHP at Day 6/7
PI in comparison to Bp-infected animals. 
Leucine-Rich Alpha-2-Glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) is
expressed during neutrophilic granulocyte differentiation
and is involved in protein–protein interactions, signal
transduction, and cell adhesion [34]. LRG1 was not quan-
titated in the naïve cohort, but in EBOV-infected animals
a 3.9-fold increase on Day 5 PI was observed (see Fig. 5a
and Table 1a).  In the Bp cohort, LRG1 was increased
1.7 fold on Day 3 PI (see Table 2b), and when comparing
LRG1 levels in EBOV- and Bp-infected NHPs, significant
p-values were obtained for Days 5 and 6 PI (see Table 3a
and Fig. 5a), confirming a higher level in EBOV-infected
animals for LRG1 at these time-points.

Plasma levels of Galectin-3 binding protein (G3BP),
also known as Lectin galactoside-binding soluble-3 bind-
ing protein, were significantly higher in EBOV-infected
rhesus macaques when compared to Bp-infected ani-
mals. G3BP was detected and quantitated in 7/10 EBOV-
infected NHPs but was quantitated in only 1 Bp-infected
animal, and was not quantitated in any plasma sample
from the naïve cohort. In EBOV-infected animals G3BP
increased 2.6 fold by Day 6 PI (see Table 1a and Fig. 5b).
Although the ANOVA comparison between the 7 EBOV- 
and 1 Bp-infected NHPs indicated that there was a signif-
icantly higher abundance of G3BP on Day 6 PI in EBOV
infected NHP (see Table 3a), due to a lack of G3BP TMT
quantitation in 4/5 Bp-infected plasma sets, an orthogo-
nal confirmation was undertaken. Western blot analysis
was performed on 5 EBOV plasma sets and 3 Bp plasma
sets using a G3BP specific monoclonal antibody. A time-
dependent increase in G3BP protein abundance on Days
4-6 PI was confirmed in the EBOV-infected plasma (see
Fig. 5c). Conversely, G3BP was not detected by Western
blot in any of the Bp plasma sets. The increase in G3BP
expression in EBOV-infected plasma observed via west-
ern blot was comparable to the TMT/MS relative abun-
dance shown in Fig. 5d for EBOV-infected NHP 1000, 
whereas in Bp-infected NHP JD27, G3BP levels remained
close to pre-infection levels throughout sampling period. 
All 5 EBOV-infected plasma sets tested for G3BP via
Western blot, exhibited the same trend of increased
abundance.
In summary, Fibrinogen and CP levels were signifi-
cantly higher in Bp-infected NHP when compared to
EBOV-infected animals. Additionally, there is a time
dependent increase in the expression of the plasma
proteins S100A8, S100A9, LRG1 and G3BP in EBOV-
infected NHP while the Bp infected cohort showed no
significant induction of these proteins, suggesting a path-
ogen specific host response.
Cellular proteins
Some cellular/non-secreted proteins exhibited signifi-
cant differences in abundance during the late phase of
EBOV (Day 6) infection in comparison to Bp infection. 
For example, in EBOV-infected NHPs, cytoplasmic
Actin levels reached a 4.4 fold increase on Day 6 PI (see
Table 1a). Conversely, Actin levels in Bp-infected animals
reached only 1.2 fold increase from the pre-infection
level on Day 5 PI (data not shown). Therefore as seen in
Fig. 3 and Table 3a, Actin levels in EBOV-infected NHP
plasma were significantly higher than the levels found in
Bp-infected NHPs on Day 6/7 PI (p = 0.0129). This dif-
ference most likely reflects a higher level of cell death
occurring late in EBOV infection, ultimately leading
to an increase in circulating actin levels. Similarly, the 
abundance level of Clusterin in EBOV-infected NHPs
was significantly elevated on Days 5 and 6 PI and when
compared to levels in Bp-infected NHP, were higher on
Day 6/7 PI (p = 0.0004, see Table 3a). Clusterin is associ-
ated with the clearance of cellular debris and apoptosis; 
as such, it is not surprising that increased levels of this
protein were detected in plasma from NHPs in the mid-
to late stages of EVD.
Apolipoproteins
Decreased levels of circulating apolipoproteins in human
patients with sepsis correlate with the severity of infec-
tion [35],  indicating that lipoprotein metabolism is
strongly influenced by infection, inflammation and sepsis
[36]. The Apolipoproteins A-1, A-II, and B are generally
considered negative acute phase reactants [37, 38]. Dur-
ing EVD in rhesus macaques, we observed decreased lev-
els of Apo A1 (see Additional file 1: Figure S2) and Apo
AII, however, an increase in the levels of Apo-B100 and
Apo-B48 was observed. Due to RNA editing, the Apo B
protein occurs in plasma in 2 main isoforms. Apo-B48
and ApoB100 share a common N-terminal sequence, 
but ApoB48 lacks ApoB100’s C-terminal LDL recep-
tor binding region [39]. In EBOV-infected plasma a sig-
nificant increase was observed for ApoB100 at Day 5 PI
(p = 0.0022) and Day 6 PI (p = 0.0003) (see Table 1a and
Fig. 6a). Unfortunately, Apo B100 was only quantitated in
1/5 Bp-infected NHPs and in that animal, a decrease of
1.8 fold was observed on Day 5 PI (see Fig. 6a). Levels of
Apo B48 increased on Days 5 and 6 PI in EBOV-infected
NHPs (see Table 2a and Fig. 6b), whereas Apo B48 abun-
dance dropped below baseline levels in Bp-infected
NHPs. This drop in Apo B48 abundance was not signifi-
cant when compared to the uninfected cohort, but as
shown in Table 3a, Bp-infected plasma levels of ApoB48
were significantly lower than the EBOV-infected NHPs
on Days 3, 5 and 6/7 PI.
Levels of Apolipoprotein E (Apo E) are often elevated
in adult and pediatric patients during bacterial infection
and sepsis [40, 41]. As shown in Table 1a, abundance lev-
els of Apo E in EBOV-infected NHPs reached a 2.50 fold
increase on Day 6 PI. In contrast, as seen in Fig. 6c, the
maximum average fold change for Apo E in the Bp cohort
was 1.24 fold on Day 5 PI, and therefore Apo E levels
were significantly higher in EBOV-infected animals on
Day 6 PI (p = 0.0008, see Table 3a, Figs. 3 and 6c).
Along with Apo A-1 and Apo A-II mentioned above, 
Apo A-IV, Apo CIII, and Apo H (β2-glycoprotein) abun-
dance levels were significantly reduced in both EBOV-
infected and Bp-infected NHPs. With the exception of
Apo H which exhibited significantly lower levels in the
Bp-infected NHP on Day 3 PI due to an earlier response, 
no significant difference was observed for the levels of

were increased in EBOV-infected NHPs on Days 5 and 6 PI. No increase was observed for these proteins in Bp-infected NHPs. d Apo CIII abundance
was reduced significantly during EBOV infection, whereas only a slight decrease in abundance was observed in Bp-infected NHPs. Abundance

analysis
these Apolipoproteins between EBOV- and Bp-infected
NHPs at any PI time point. Therefore, in summary, 
during EVD in rhesus macaques, Apo B100, ApoB48, 
and Apo E increase in expression and reach higher fold
change values than the Bp-infected NHP, whereas Apo
A1, Apo AII, Apo A4, Apo CIII and Apo H act as negative
acute phase reactants in both infection types with com-
parable reductions.
Complement cascade components
Multiple proteins involved in the complement cascade
were identified and quantitated in plasma from EBOV- 
and Bp-infected NHPs, and many abundance differences
were observed between the two cohorts. Levels of the 
complement protein C1r were significantly increased
in EBOV-infected NHPs on Days 5 and 6 PI (Table 1a).
As seen in Fig. 7a, C1r levels in Bp-infected NHPs did
increase marginally on Days 3 and 5 PI, but this increase
was not significant from levels in naïve animals. The
increase of C1r in the EBOV cohort was significantly dif-
ferent from levels in the Bp cohort on Days 5 and 6 PI
(see Table 3a). Also increased in abundance in the EBOV-
infected NHPs were Complement components C1s and
C2 on Day 6 PI (Table 2a and Additional file 1: Figure
S2B/C).  The level of C2 continued to rise in EBOV-
infected NHP and was significantly higher on Day 6 PI
than levels in the Bp-infected animals which remained
close to baseline (p = 0.0111 see Table 3a).

Fig. 7  Comparison of complement protein abundance in plasma during EBOV- or Bp-infection in rhesus macaques. a Abundance levels of
C1r were higher in plasma collected from EBOV-infected rhesus macaques on Days 5 and 6 PI. The abundance of b C4B, c C4A and d C5 were
significantly higher in plasma samples collected during Bp infection when compared to EBOV-infected samples. Abundance levels that were
significantly different from levels found in naïve NHPs are designated with a black border around the symbol and levels that were significantly
different between EBOV- and Bp-infected NHPs are designated with an asterisk (*). Statistical significance was based on 2-way ANOVA analysis
Major differences in Complement component 4 (C4) 
levels were observed between EBOV- and Bp-infected
rhesus macaques. C4 is a polymorphic serum protein
consisting of two isoforms, C4A and C4B, which are
encoded by two separate genes located within chro-
mosome 6p on the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC class III) in both humans and macaques [42, 
43]. Complement C4B exhibited the largest abundance
increase compared to other complement components
in Bp-infected NHPs, reaching a 2 fold increase by Day
7 PI (see Table 1b).  Unfortunately, this protein was
not quantitated in the naïve cohort. In EBOV-infected
NHPs, C4B levels were actually reduced 1.3 fold from 
the pre-infection level (ratio = 0.75) on Day 6 PI. As
seen Fig. 7b, although the levels of C4B in the Bp cohort
had larger variation, the abundance increase was signif-
icant from levels observed in the EBOV cohort for Days
3, 5 and 6/7 PI, (p = 0.0103, 0.0028 and 0.0004 respec-
tively: see Table 3a). Levels of C4A were also higher in
the Bp-infected cohort. As seen in Table 2b and Fig. 7c, 
C4A abundance was increased significantly in Bp-
infected plasma by Day 5 PI, (p = 0.0022 see Table 2b).
Conversely, C4A levels in the EBOV cohort were not
significantly different from the naïve cohort at any time
point, and therefore were significantly lower than the
C4A abundance observed in the Bp-infected cohort, 
Page 19
Ward et al. Clin Proteom (2019) 16:7  Page 19 of 23
especially for Days 5 and 6/7 PI (p = 0.0004, see Fig. 7c
and Table 3a).
In addition to C4A and C4B, levels of complement
components C5 and C3 were also significantly higher in
Bp-infected NHPs when compared to EBOV-infected
NHPs. As shown in Fig. 7d, on Days 5 and 6/7 PI, C5 lev-
els were significantly higher in Bp-infected animals when
compared to EBOV-infected NHPs (see also Table 3a, 
Fig. 3), and when comparing C3 abundance, Bp-infected
animals displayed significantly higher levels on Day 6/7
PI (see Additional file 1: Figure S2(D)).
Complement proteins Factor B and component C9
were increased in both the Bp- and EBOV-infected
NHP on Days 3–5 PI. In EBOV-infected NHPs Factor
B rose to a significant level on Day 4 PI (p = 0.0095, see
Table 2a and Additional file 1: Figure S3(A)), and on Day
6 PI, reached a maximum increase of 1.9 fold. In the Bp-
infected cohort, Factor B was increased modestly from
Day 3 to Day 5 PI, and dropped slightly on Day 6 PI (see
Table 2b).  Due to the continued increase of Factor B
observed in the EBOV-infected NHPs, levels of this pro-
tein were significantly higher on Day 6 when compared
to Bp-infected animals (p = 0.0130, see Table 3a). Com-
plement C9 abundance rose in both cohorts during infec-
tion (see Additional file 1: Figure S3(B)), and reached a
similar maximum. Due to the difference in host response
kinetics, levels of C9 in the Bp cohort were significantly
higher when compared to levels observed in the EBOV
cohort on Day 3 PI only (p = 0.023, see Table 3b).
Classic negative acute phase plasma proteins
Classic negative acute phase proteins were quantitated
in both the EBOV- and Bp-infected NHP. For example, 
Albumin was reduced significantly in EBOV- and Bp-
infected animals (see Table 2a, b), and was significantly
lower in the Bp cohort on Day 3 PI (p = 0.0066, see
Table 3b), but the EBOV cohort reached a comparable
reduction on Days 5-7 PI. Similarly, levels of Transfer-
rin, Afamin, Fetuin A (Alpha-2-HS Glycoprotein), Fetuin
B and Transthyretin were reduced in both infection
types, and no statistical difference was found between
their levels. Levels of Fibronectin 1 were significantly
reduced in both infection types, and reached compara-
ble reductions, but due to an earlier drop in levels in the
Bp-infected animals, levels of Fibronectin 1 were signifi-
cantly lower when compared to the EBOV-infected NHP
on Day 3 PI (p = 0.0004 see Table 3b and Additional file 1: 
Figure S3C).
The inter-alpha (globulin) inhibitor (ITI) family (also
known as the family of inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitors) is
composed of serine protease inhibitor proteins that are
assembled from two precursors: a light chain and either
one or two heavy chains [44, 45]. During infection and 
inflammation, ITI family members can act as both posi-
tive and negative acute phase reactants under various dis-
ease conditions including sepsis and cancer [46, 47]. We
detected and quantitated inter-alpha (globulin) inhibi-
tor H1, H2, H3 and H4 during EBOV and Bp infection
in rhesus macaques. In this study, ITIH1, ITIH2, were
found to be negative acute phase reactants while ITIH3, 
and ITIH4 acted as positive acute phase proteins during
both infection types in NHPs (see Fig. 3, Tables 1b and
2a).
In summary for most negative acute phase proteins, 
comparable reductions were observed in both infection
types. This includes, Albumin, Fibronectin 1, the Fetuins
A/B, and the inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitors ITIH1 and
ITIH2.
Discussion
Our approach to the characterization of the rhesus
macaque plasma host response to infection is novel in
comparison with other studies because we have 1) sam-
pled naïve NHP to better define the variability of acute
phase proteins during the sampling period, and 2) com-
pared the rhesus proteomic response in two different
infection types (EVD vs. melioidosis).  The NHP host
response to EBOV infection has been reported in previ-
ous studies employing transcriptomic approaches, and
a few of these studies have detected upregulated gene
expression before the appearance of symptoms [9, 48].
However, no comparison was made with other infection
types and therefore the specificity of the transcriptomic
response is unknown. Comparative analysis from previ-
ous published studies indicates that although some pro-
teins involved in the acute phase response (APR) exhibit
similar trends of altered expression in multiple infection
types, the fold changes exhibited for certain proteins are
quite different depending on the pathogenic agent [49].
Our data supports this finding and therefore future inves-
tigations hold promise for the identification and develop-
ment of panels of human APR proteins which may have
expression patterns that are unique for infection types or
disease states.
The observed differences in the plasma temporal
response between EBOV- and Bp-infected NHPs is most
likely due to the faster replication rate of Bp versus EBOV
and the different infection routes used for exposure (aer-
osol vs. IM). These differences resulted in some protein
abundance differences between the two infection cohorts
at the early (Day 3) or late (Day 6/7) overlapping PI time
points. Accordingly, some of the protein differences
observed between the two infection types may be attrib-
uted to the immune cells which encounter the pathogen
first, leading to the activation of different cellular signal-
ing outcomes.

Most of the host proteins quantitated displayed altered
abundance levels by Day 4 or 5 PI in EBOV-infected rhe-
sus macaques. This is concurrent with detectable viremia
and development of pyrexia in most of the animals. We
noted that animals with an early onset of fever (by Day
3 PI) also had altered protein levels beginning on Day 3
PI. This phenomenon is in agreement with a recent tran-
scriptomic study showing cytokine gene expression is
concurrent with the onset of fever in EVD [9]. Interest-
ingly, in some NHP, alteration of host response protein
levels occurred before pyrexia and detectable viremia. 
For example, NHP 0469 presented with fever and detect-
able viremia on Day 4 PI (see Additional file 1: Table S1),
but on Day 3 PI the abundance of LRG1 was increased
1.6 fold for this animal. Since our proteomic approach
was untargeted, it may be possible to detect altered
expression at earlier pre-symptomatic time points using a
targeted LC–MS/MS approach.
Our comparison of the plasma host response to EBOV
and Bp infection has important implications for efforts
to discriminate viral from bacterial infections in human
samples. Levels of CRP and SAA have been reported to
be significantly higher in some bacterial infections when
compared to viral infections [50–53]. In this study, CRP
and SAA abundance in Bp-infected animals was signifi-
cantly higher than levels found in EBOV-infected NHPs
only for Day 3 PI due to a difference in host response
kinetics. At the later common time points of Day 5 PI
and Day 6/7 PI there was no significant difference in CRP
or SAA levels. It can be argued that the pathogenicity of
EBOV infection puts EVD in an entirely different class
than typical viral infections, since the level of these acute
phase proteins has been reported to increase with dis-
ease severity [54]. Therefore the observed levels of CRP
and SAA during EVD in rhesus macaques may be higher
than what would be expected from an infection caused
by some common respiratory viruses.
Ceruloplasmin (CP) levels were significantly higher in
Bp-infected NHP on Day 3 and 5 PI when compared to
EBOV-infected animals. CP is a multi-copper oxidase
that is secreted from the liver, involved in iron homeo-
stasis, and accounts for 95% of the copper content of the
serum [55]. CP is also an acute phase protein induced in
response to inflammation, trauma, or infection with bac-
teria, viruses and protozoans [56–58]. Since CP is a fer-
roxidase, it has been proposed that the increased level of
this protein during bacterial infections is part of an innate
immune strategy to mobilize iron from tissues to starve
invading bacterial pathogens of essential iron nutrients
[59]. Thus, the observation in our data that plasma CP
levels are higher during Bp infection versus EBOV infec-
tion is in line with this theory and suggests a pathogen
specific response. 
Both LRG1 and G3BP were increased significantly
during EVD in rhesus macaques, when compared to Bp-
infected NHP. LRG1 is an acute phase protein that is pro-
duced by hepatocytes after IL-6 induction and secreted
from neutrophils after activation [60].  Levels of LRG1
are increased in many inflammatory conditions includ-
ing sepsis, appendicitis, rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. 
Therefore, the higher level of LRG1 may indicate that the
degree of inflammation (and neutrophil activation) dur-
ing infection is greater in EBOV-infected animals than
in Bp-infected animals. G3BP is a secreted glycoprotein, 
and although all of its biological functions are not yet
fully understood, it has been observed to promote cell-
to-cell adhesion, stimulate host-defense against viruses
and may be a surrogate biomarker for type 1 interferon-
dependent gene activation [61–63]. G3BP is upregulated
in many cancers and during infection with several viruses
such as HIV, Hepatitis C, Dengue and Hantavirus [64–
67]. Our data is in agreement with anti-viral host defense
functions, since increased expression was observed dur-
ing EBOV, but not Bp infection. Using ELISA quantita-
tion, Hepojoki et al. found a significant increase in G3BP
levels in serum samples from cynomolgus macaques
during Hantavirus infection beginning on Day 7 or 8 PI
[65]. Additionally, analysis of plasma samples collected
from human patients with acute Hantavirus or Dengue
infection showed higher G3BP levels when compared to
healthy controls [66].  G3BP abundance increases have
also been reported during inflammatory conditions such
as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythema-
tosus, suggesting that chronic bacterial infection could
also induce G3BP due prolonged inflammation. There-
fore, the examination of plasma at later time points dur-
ing the chronic phase of Bp infection will be necessary
to determine if G3BP is increased. Although both LRG1
and G3BP are not filovirus-specific induced proteins, the
increased level produced may be useful as blood-based
markers to distinguish infection types (bacterial vs. viral) 
during the acute phase.
Plasma fibrinogen levels in Bp-infected NHPs were
significantly higher than levels found in EBOV-infected
animals. In a transcriptomic analysis reported in 2017 by
Liu et al., some of the most highly differentially expressed
genes during EBOV infection in humans were fibrino-
gen alpha, beta, and gamma [68]. Likewise, Ebihara et al. 
found increased fibrinogen levels in rhesus macaques on
Days 4 and 5 of EBOV infection which strikingly declined
at the terminal stages of EVD [69]. Plasma fibrinogen lev-
els are known to decline due to the conversion of fibrino-
gen to fibrin, and EVD causes coagulopathy resembling
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) at the ter-
minal stages of disease [70]. However, since fibrinogen is
an acute phase reactant produced by the liver, increased
Page 21
Ward et al. Clin Proteom (2019) 16:7  Page 21 of 23
levels during inflammation and infection may mask
fibrinogen consumption during clot formation. In this
study, fibrinogen α, β, and γ were increased during EBOV
infection beginning on Day 4 PI and reverted to baseline
by Day 6 PI. The increase in fibrinogen protein levels was
much higher in Bp-infected NHPs beginning on Day 3 PI
and remained high through Day 9 PI. Generally, by Day
4 of EVD in rhesus macaques, macrophages, monocytes, 
dendritic cells, and fibroblasts are infected, but serum
chemistry alterations, petechia and uncontrolled hem-
orrhage usually do not manifest until after Day 4 PI [69, 
71].  Additionally, abnormal coagulation measurements
(i.e. Prothrombin time: PT and Activated Partial Throm-
boplastin Time: APTT) have been reported to peak
between Days 6 and 10 PI during EBOV infection in rhe-
sus macaques [71]. Collectively, this evidence indicates
that the lower fibrinogen level observed during EVD
when compared to Bp infection is not the result of fibrin-
ogen consumption on Days 4 or 5 PI, while the drop in
fibrinogen levels observed on Day 6 PI may be the result
of fibrinogen conversion to fibrin. Additionally, although
hepatocytes are usually infected by Day 3 or 4 PI during
EVD [72],  widespread liver damage does not typically
appear at this stage of the infection. Therefore fibrino-
gen abundance observed on Day 4 PI is most likely not
affected by a decline in hepatocyte production. Although
we observed other acute phase reactants and markers of
inflammation to be highly upregulated in EBOV-infected
NHPs, the lower level of Fibrinogen in EVD in compari-
son with Bp-infected NHPs is not easily explained. Given
the evidence of highly upregulated Fibrinogen transcripts
during EBOV infection in humans, it is tempting to spec-
ulate that the virus is somehow able to suppress the pro-
duction of the fibrinogen proteins in circulating plasma.
Our data from NHPs during EVD is in agreement with
the lipoprotein alterations observed during sepsis, in that
plasma levels of Apo A1 were reduced while Apo E levels
increased. In this study true sepsis was not observed in
the Bp-infected animals, since only 1/5 NHPs had a posi-
tive blood culture, and therefore we observed only a slight
increase in Apo E abundance. It has been reported that
triglyceride levels increase by at least fivefold in EBOV-
infected rhesus macaques, but total cholesterol changes
are negligible [71]. The increase of Apo B we observed dur-
ing EBOV infection is likely a direct result of the increase
in chylomicron particles carrying plasma triglycerides.
Increases in levels of proteins relevant to all three com-
plement pathways were observed during EBOV and Bp 
infection in rhesus macaques. The ongoing identifica-
tion of novel mechanisms of viral antagonism of compo-
nents of the complement system highlights the important
role of these pathways in innate immunity. For example, 
the NS1 glycoprotein of some Flaviviruses (i.e. Dengue, 
West Nile and Yellow fever), which is expressed on the
surface of and secreted by infected cells, can suppress
complement by recruiting and activating C1s and C4BP
to promote cleavage of C4 and inactivate C4B [73]. Addi-
tionally, both soluble and membrane-bound NS1 proteins
of Dengue and West Nile viruses have been reported to
interact with the complement regulatory component fac-
tor H, resulting in decreased deposition of C3 and C5b-9
membrane attack complexes on cell surfaces [74]. Our
data indicates that the levels of complement components
C1r, C1s, C2, C9 and factor B are significantly increased
in plasma during EBOV infection. While there was a
slight non-significant increase in the abundance level
of C3 and C5. Conversely, Bp-infected NHPs displayed
increases in C3, C4A, C4B, C5 and C9, which were signif-
icantly higher than those found in EBOV-infected NHPs. 
It is possible that excess complement activation lead
to the consumption of C3, C4 (A/B) and C5 in plasma
during EVD, or the lower levels observed for these pro-
teins may indicate an antagonism of complement com-
ponents, specifically those downstream of C1 and C2, 
by the EBOV virus. An antagonistic strategy that causes
the downregulation of the proinflammatory chemoat-
tractants (C3A, C4A and C5A) in plasma during EBOV
infection would lead to a reduced influx of inflammatory
cells into infected sites, potentially contributing to EVD
pathogenesis.
Conclusions
In conclusion, plasma proteomic analysis uncovered spe-
cific differences in acute phase protein levels induced
during EVD or melioidosis in rhesus macaques. These
differences reflect the global circulating innate immune
response to a highly pathogenic viral or bacterial agent
in relevant NHP models of infection. Most notable in our
results is the higher level of fibrinogen and complement
proteins C3, C4, and C5 exhibited by Bp-infected NHPs, 
while EBOV-infected animals displayed higher levels
of two glycoproteins: LRG1 and G3BP. Future studies
examining the plasma proteomic host response of rhesus
macaques to other infection types endemic to the same
regions where EBOV and Bp are prevalent will facilitate
the identification and development of a panel of plasma
host proteins that could be used to differentiate infection
types. These panels could then be validated using human
samples to determine the diagnostic potential.
