Abstract
Background: Between 8 May 2018 and 27 May 2019, cumulatively there were 1286 deaths from Ebola Virus Disease
(EVD) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The objective of this study was to estimate the monetary value of
human lives lost through EVD in DRC.
Methods: Human capital approach was applied to monetarily value years of life lost due to premature deaths from EVD.
The future losses were discounted to their present values at 3% discount rate. The model was reanalysed using 5 and
10% discount rates. The analysis was done alternately using the average life expectancies for DRC, the world, and the
Japanese females to assess the effect on the monetary value of years of life lost (MVYLL).
Results: The 1286 deaths resulted in a total MVYLL of Int$17,761,539 assuming 3% discount rate and DRC life expectancy
of 60.5 years. The average monetary value per EVD death was of Int$13,801. About 44.7 and 48.6% of the total MVYLL was
borne by children aged below 9 years and adults aged between 15 years and 59 years, respectively.
Re-estimation of the algorithm with average life expectancies of the world (both sexes) and Japanese females,
holding discount rate constant at 3%, increased the MVYLL by Int$ 3,667,085 (20.6%) and Int$ 7,508,498 (42.3%), respectively.
The application of discount rates of 5 and 10%, holding life expectancy constant at 60.5 years, reduced the MVYLL by Int$ 4,
252,785 (− 23.9%) and Int$ 9,658,195 (− 54.4%) respectively.
Conclusion: The EVD outbreak in DRC led to a considerable MVYLL. There is an urgent need for DRC government
and development partners to disburse adequate resources to strengthen the national health system and other systems
that address social determinants of health to end recurrence of EVD outbreaks.

Background
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is situated
in Central Africa [1]. It is divided into 26 administrative
provinces and has a population of 97.879 million persons.
The country had a total gross domestic product (GDP) of
US$ 48.458 billion and a per capita GDP of US$ 495.1
(equivalent to Int$ 791.19) in 2019 [2].
In 2017 DRC had a low human development index
(HDI) of 0.457 and inequality-adjusted HDI of 0.319; life
expectancy of 60.5 years; and 6.8 mean years of schooling

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article 
[3]. It had an overall multidimensional poverty index of
0.378. The low standard of living contributes 56.2%, health
25% and education 18.9% to overall multidimensional
poverty. Approximately, 57 million of the population live
in multidimensional poverty.
The Ministry of Health in DRC notified World Health
Organization (WHO) of confirmed cases of ongoing
Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in the provinces of
North Kivu and Ituri on 8 May 2018 [4]. As of 27 May
2019, the cumulative number of EVD cases was 1926.
There were 1286 EVD-related deaths between 8 May
2018 and 27 May 2019; of which 91.8 and 8.2% occurred
in North-Kivu and Ituri provinces, respectively [5] (See

The recurrent EVD epidemics could be attributed par-
tially to underinvestment in the national health system
and other systems that address social determinants of
health [6]. For instance, the current health expenditure
(CHE) per capita was US$21 in 2016; which was below
the US$74 to US$ 198 total cost per person needed to
reach health system targets for the attainment of SDG3
[7].  It was made up of domestic general government
health expenditure (GGHE-D) per capita of US$3; do-
mestic private health expenditure (PVT-D) per capita of
US$9; and external health expenditure (EXT) per capita
of US$9. The DRC out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPS)
per capita of US$8 was 88.9% of PVT-D and 38.1% of
CHE [8]. According to the WHO World Health Report
2010 [9],  when OOPs are above 15–20% of CHE, the
incidence of financial catastrophe and impoverishment
increases substantially.
The DRC universal health coverage (UHC) service
index was 40% in 2015 [6];  implying essential health
services coverage gap of 60%.  The tracer indicators of
the essential health services include reproduction, mater-
nal, newborn and child health (family planning, pregnancy
and delivery care, child immunization and treatment);
infectious diseases (TB treatment, HIV treatment, malaria
prevention, water and sanitation); noncommunicable dis-
eases (treatment of cardiovascular diseases, management
of diabetes, cervical cancer screening, tobacco control);
and services capacity and access (hospital access, health
worker density, essential medicines and health security)
[6]. There is a need for sustained evidence-based advocacy
for the DRC government, private sector, and external
partners to increase their investments in the building of
resilient national health system to attain universal cover-
age of essential health services.
Some of the evidence needed for advocacy is the mon-
etary value of lives lost from a disease such as EVD. A
few studies have estimated the economic burden of
EVD. For example, Bartsch, Gorham and Lee estimated
the cost of an EVD case in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra
Leone [10]. Kirigia et al estimated the future productiv-
ity losses associated with EVD deaths in Guinea, Liberia,
Mali, Nigeria and Sierra Leone [11]. Kastelic et al esti-
mated the socio-economic impacts of Ebola in Sierra
Leone [12]. Bowles et al estimated the extent to which
economic activity declined and jobs disappeared in
Liberia during the outbreak [13].  Thomas, Smith and
Ferreira provided an update of the macro-economic
impact of Ebola on sub-Saharan Africa in 2015 [14].
There is a dearth of similar economic evidence on the
EVD epidemic in DRC.
Thus, the aim of this study is to contribute towards
bridging that knowledge gap. The specific objective was
to estimate the monetary value of human lives lost from
EVD in DRC. 
Methods
Human capital approach framework
This study employed human capital approach (HCA) to
monetarily value potential years of life lost (PYLL) due
to premature mortality caused by the EVD in the DRC
between 8 May 2018 and 27 May 2019. Culyer [15]
defines human capital as the stock of human skills (de-
termined by basic ability, educational attainment and
health status) embodied in an individual; which is mea-
sured as the present value of expected earnings over a
period of time [15].
Death extinguishes expected flow of productive capabil-
ity in future years. Assuming per capita GDP is a proxy of
individual person’s rate of remuneration, the productivity
forgone by society because of premature mortality from
EVD is the sum of the discounted stream of potential earn-
ings that could have accrued over the potential years of life
lost (PYLL) [16]. According to Gardner and Sanborn [17].
PYLL is a measure of the average time a person would
have lived had (s)he not died prematurely, i.e. DRC life ex-
pectancy at death minus age group’s average age at death.
Thus, potential economic losses to society were estimated
using PYLL, a cut-off point at the DRC life expectancy at
birth of 60.5 years, 3% discount rate, number of EVD deaths
at various age groups, and non-health per capita GDP (per
capita GDP minus total current health expenditure). Only
the PYLL above the DRC minimum working age for admis-
sion to work of 15 years was monetarily valued for age
groups 1–4 years, 5–9 years and 10–14 years [18].
The analytical framework formulated below was adapted
from the frameworks applied in estimating the indirect
costs of maternal deaths in 2010 [19], maternal deaths in
2013 [20], child mortality [21], neglected tropical diseases
deaths [22],  tuberculosis [23] and non-communicable
disease deaths [24] in the WHO African Region, and
Ebola Virus Disease in West Africa [11]. As recommended
first by Weisbrod [25], and subsequently, by WHO [26]
we deducted current health expenditure from gross prod-
uctivity to obtain net productivity.
The monetary value of potential PYLL lost (MVYLL) due
to EVD deaths in DRC is the sum of the potential non-
health GDP lost among those aged 1–4 (MVYLL1 − 4
),
those aged 5–9 (MVYLL5 − 9
), those aged 10–14 (MVYLL10
− 14
), those aged 15–19 (MVYLL15 − 19
), those aged 20–24
(MVYLL20 − 24
),  those aged 25–29 (MVYLL25 − 29
),  those
aged 30–34 (MVYLL30 − 34
), those aged 35–39 (MVYLL35 −
39
),  those aged 40–44 (MVYLL40 − 44
),  those aged 45–49
(MVYLL45 − 49
),  those aged 50–54 (MVYLL50 − 54
),  those
aged 55–59 (MVYLL55 − 59
), those aged 60–64 (MVYLL60 −
64
),  those aged 65–69 (MVYLL65 − 69
),  those aged 70–74
(MVYLL70 − 74
),  those aged 75–79 (MVYLL75 − 79
),  those
aged 80–84 (MVYLL80 − 84
), those aged 85–89 (MVYLL85 −
89
), those aged 90–94 (MVYLL90 − 94
), and those aged 95
years and above (MVYLL≥95
).

The MVYLL among persons of a specific age group is
the product of the total discounted years of life lost, per
capita non-health GDP in purchasing power parity
(NHGPCInt$
)  and the total number of EVD deaths
(EVDD) for age group [11, 19–24].  The DRC’s dis-
counted total non-health GDP loss attributable to EVD
deaths (MVYLLDRC
) was estimated using the eqs. (1)
and (2) below [11] (see Additional file 2 for details).

); EVDDi 
is the num-
ber of EVD deaths occurring in age group i, where i = 1
correspond to the age group 1–4 years, i = 2 to the age
group 5–9 years, i = 3 to the age group 10–14 years, i = 4
to the age group 15–19 years, i = 5 to the age group 20–

69 years, i = 14 to the age group 70–74 years, i = 15 to
the age group 70–74 years, i = 16 to the age group 75–
79 years, i = 17 to the age group 80–84 years, i = 18 to
the age group 85–89 years, i = 19 to the age group 90– 
94 years, and i = 20 to the age group 95 years and above
in DRC. The base year to which GDP losses occurring in
future years were discounted is 2019. The average mon-
etary value per EVD death was obtained by dividing
MVYLLDRC 
by the total number of EVD deaths.
Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis is a procedure of assessing the robust-
ness of monetary valuation of years of life lost by consider-
ing the effects of uncertainty [15, 27]. In this study, there
was uncertainty about the life expectancy at birth and
discount rate used. Thus, the algorithm was estimated
assuming DRC life expectancy of 60.5 years, the global
average life expectancy of 72 years, and Japan female life
expectancy of 87 years (the longest in the world) [6]. The
algorithm was also re-estimated assuming discount rates
of 3, 5 and 10%. The results can be deemed robust if the
conclusions remain unchanged [28, 29].
Data sources
The 1286 EVD-related deaths that occurred between 8
May 2018 and 27 May 2019 were obtained from the DRC
Ministry of Health [5]. The distribution of EVD deaths by
each of the 20 age groups was estimated using data from
the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)
global burden of disease study 2017 database [30].  The
DRC life expectancy at birth, Japan female life expectancy,
and global average life expectancy were obtained from
World Health Statistics 2019 [6].  The current health
expenditure per capita of 34 International Dollars (Int$)
or Purchasing Power Parity was obtained from the WHO
Global Health Expenditure Database [8].  The GDP of
Int$791.19 per capita for DRC in 2019 was gotten from
IMF World Outlook database [2].  The equations were
estimated using Excel Software, Microsoft Corporation,
New York.
Data analysis
The economic model was estimated in 8 steps using
Excel Software (Microsoft Corporation, New York):
Step 1: Development of analysis algorithm on Excel
software
The equations developed in the HCA analytical frame-
work above were built into a spreadsheet.
Step 2: Extraction of EVD mortality data
The data on the total number of EVD deaths between
8 May 2018 and 27 May 2019 was extracted from the
DRC Ministry of Health website [5].

Step 3: Distribution of EVD deaths from step 2 across
the 20 age groups
The number of EVD deaths by each of the 20 age groups
was obtained by multiplying total number of EVD deaths
[5] and relevant proportion [30] (See Additional file 3). For
example, the since the total number of EVD deaths was
1286 and the proportion for age group 1–4 years was
0.22857, the number of deaths in age group 1–4 years
equals 1286 multiplied by 0.22857, i.e. 294.
Step 4: Estimation of undiscounted potential productive
years of life lost
The DRC life expectancy at birth of 60.5 years, global
average life expectancy of 72 years, and Japan female life
expectancy of 87.1 years (i.e. the highest in the world)
were obtained from Annex 1 (part 1) of the World
Health Statistics 2019 report [6].  Assuming DRC life
expectancy of 60.5 years [6],  the ith age group undis-
counted potential years of life lost (PYLL) from EVD
equals average life expectancy at birth for DRC minus
the average age at death for ith age group, where i = 1,2,
3,…,20. For example, the PYLL for a death in age group
15–19 equals 43.5 years, i.e. [60.5 – ((15 + 19)/2)].  The
undiscounted PYLL for the 20 age groups are contained
in Additional file 4.
The undiscounted PYLLs in Additional file 5 were
calculated, in a similar manner, assuming the world and
the Japan female life expectancies. The PYLL cannot be
negative. Thus, for age groups with average age at death
greater than DRC life average life expectancy of 60.5
years, their PYLL are assumed to be equal to zero [31]. 
from EVD, for all the 20 age groups, assuming DRC life
expectancy and 3% discount rate. The discounted poten-
tially productive YLLs in Additional file 7 were calculated,
in a similar way, assuming the world and the Japan female
life expectancies and a 3% discount rate.
Step 6: Estimation of non-health GDP per capita
(NHGPCInt$
)
The data on GDP per capita of Int$791.19 was obtained
from the IMF World Outlook Database [2]; and current
health expenditure per capita of Int$34 from WHO Glo-
bal Health Expenditure Database [8]. The NHGPCInt$ 
was
the difference between GDP per capita and current health
expenditure per capita for DRC, i.e. Int$791.19 – Int$34 =
Int$757.19 per person.
Step 7: Calculation of MVYLL per age group
The algorithm developed in Step 1 was estimated assum-
ing the DRC life expectancy at birth and 3% discount rate.
The information on number of deaths by age group in
Additional file 3; discounted potential years of life lost from
EVD assuming DRC life expectancy in Additional file 6;
and non-health GDP per capita for DRC were used in
calculation of MVYLL for each age group.
For example, MVYLL for 1–4 years’ age group was the
product of non-health GDP per capita (Int$757.19),  dis-
counted years of life lost per death in the age group
(25.02470783) and number of EVD deaths in the age group
(294).  Therefore, MVYLL1–4 
= 757.19 × 25.02470783 ×
294 = Int$ 5,570,847. The MVYLL for the other age groups
was calculated in a similar manner.
Step 5: Discounting of potentially productive YLL
The potentially productive YLLs estimated in Step 4
were discounted at a rate (r) of 3% using the following
formula: 1/(1 + r)t,  i.e. the discount factor formula. For
example, the first year of life lost would be discounted as
follows: [1 × 1/(1 + 0.03)1 = 0.97087. The discounted (or
present value) for the second YLL would be [1 x [1/
(1 + 0.03)2] = 0.942596; for third YLL would be [1 x
[1/(1 + 0.03)3] = 0.915142; and for the nth YLL (e.g. for
a premature death in age group 15–19) would be [1 x
[1/(1 + 0.03)43.5] = 0.276427. Thus, present value of the
total years of life lost (PVYLLi
) from one death in a
given ith age group equals the sum of the discount
factors multiplied by each undiscounted YLL, i.e.

Step 8: Conduct of sensitivity analysis
Step 8.1: Sensitivity to discount rate
Equations (1) to (20) were re-estimated with 5% (see
Additional file 8) and 10% (see Additional file 9) discount
rates to measure the sensitivity of the monetary value of
years of life lost. For example, at the DRC life expect-
ancy and 5% discount rate, the MVYLL1–4 
= 757.19 ×
17.98101571 × 294 = Int$4,002,823. At the world life
expectancy and 5% discount rate, the MVYLL1–4 
=
757.19 × 18.8195417 × 294 = Int$4,189,491. At the Japanese
Female life expectancy and 5% discount rate, the MVYLL1–
4 
= 757.19 × 19.43217937 × 294 = Int$ 4,325,872.
At the DRC life expectancy and 10% discount rate, the
MVYLL1–4 
= 757.19 × 9.886618082 × 294 = Int$ 2,200,
898. At the world life expectancy and 10% discount rate,
the MVYLL1–4 
= 757.19 × 9.96026033 × 294 = Int$2,217,
292. At the Japanese Female life expectancy and 10% dis-
count rate, the MVYLL1–4 
= 757.19 × 9.990486639 ×
294 = Int$2,224,021. The sensitivity analysis of MVYLL
Page 5
Kirigia et al. BMC Public Health (2019) 19:1218  Page 5 of 9
to changes in discount rates for the other age groups
was calculated in the same way.
Step 8.2: Sensitivity to life expectancy
In order to determine the impact of life expectancy on
MVYLL estimates, the equations were re-estimated al-
ternately assuming the world life expectancy of 72 years
(Additional file 7) and the Japanese female life expect-
ancy of 87 years (which is the highest in the world)
(Additional file 7).  At the world life expectancy of 72
years and 3% discount rate, the MVYLL1–4 
= 757.19 ×
27.33100549 × 294 = Int$ 6,084,261. At the Japanese Fe-
male life expectancy of 87 years and 3% discount rate,
the MVYLL1–4 
= 757.19 × 29.4806675 × 294 = Int$ 6,562,
805. The sensitivity analysis of MVYLL to changes in life
expectancy for the other age groups was estimated in
the same manner.
Results
Table 1 provides a breakdown of the monetary value of
potential years of life lost from Ebola Virus Disease in
DRC discounted at a 3% rate. The 1286 deaths resulted
in total MVYLL of Int$17,761,539; Int$21,428,624; and 
Int$25,270,037 assuming DRC life expectancy of 60.5
years, the average global life expectancy of 72 years and
Japan female life expectancy of 87 years, respectively.
The average MVYLL assuming DRC, global and Japan
female life expectancies was Int$13,801, Int$16,650 and
Int$19,635 per death, respectively.
Out of the Int$17,761,539, about 31.4% occurred among
1–4-year-old; 13.3% among 5–9-year-old; 6.7% among
10–14-year-old; 4.7% among 15–19-year-old; 3.7% among
20–24-year-old; 3.2% among 25–29-year-old; 2.9% among
30–34-year-old; 27.9% among 35–39-year-old; 2.3%
among 40–44-year-old; 1.9% among 45–49-year-old; 1.4%
among 50–54-year-old; and 0.6% among 55–59-year-old.
Thus, 48.6% of the MVYLL occurred among adults aged
between 15 years and 59 years; which is the most product-
ive age bracket.
Use of the Japanese female life expectancy at birth of
87 years, holding discount rate constant at 3%, increased
the MVYLL by Int$ 7,508,498 (42.3%). Utilization of the
average global life expectancy at birth of 72 years, hold-
ing discount rate constant at 3%, increased the MVYLL
by Int$ 3,667,085 (20.6%).

Discussion
This study has estimated the monetary value of human
lives lost due to EVD outbreak between 8 May 2018 and
27 May 2019 in DRC. The 1286 EVD-related deaths re-
sulted in total MVYLL of Int$17,761,539; which trans-
lates to Int$13,801 per death. The main drivers of
MVYLL estimates were the life expectancy and discount
rate used.
How does this MVYLL per EVD-related death in DRC
compare to similar studies conducted in the past in
other African countries? Kirigia et al [11] estimated
productivity loss per EVD death to be Int$ 17,473 for
Guinea, Int$ 11,283 for Liberia, Int$ 25,126 for Mali, 
Int$ 47,364 for Nigeria and Int$ 14,633 for Sierra Leone.
Thus, MVYLL per EVD death in DRC is lower than that
of Guinea, Mali, Nigeria and Sierra Leone due to lower
per capita GDP.
How does this MVYLL per EVD-related death com-
pare to that of other diseases? Kirigia et al [19] estimated
the African Region average grand total non-health GDP
loss to be Int$ 30,203 per maternal death; and Int$ 16,
397 per maternal death in 2010 for low-income coun-
tries. Another study estimated the African Region low-
income countries discounted value of future non-health
GDP loss due to maternal deaths in 2013 at Int$19,822
per maternal death [20].  Kirigia and Muthuri [23] ap-
praised the African Region average grand total non-
health GDP loss to be Int$66,872 per tuberculosis death;
and Int$21,513 per tuberculosis death in 2014 for low-
income countries. The expected future productivity loss
per child death in the WHO African Region in 2013 was
estimated to be Int$50,494; and Int$ 25,508 per child
death for low-income countries [21]. In 2015 the mean
value of human life lost per NTD death in the African
Continent was Int$ 37,489; and Int$ 37,489 per human
life in low-income countries [22]. In 2012 the WHO Af-
rican Region average grand total non-health GDP loss

was Int$ 21,985 per NCD death; and Int$ 9096 per NCD

mate of MVYLL per EVD death in DRC is lower than
the indirect cost per maternal death, tuberculosis death,
child death and NTD death in Africa. However, MVYLL
per EVD death in DRC was larger than the indirect cost
per NCD death in low-income countries in Africa. Given
the virulent nature of EVD and its multi-sectoral nega-
tive consequences, concerted national, continental and
global effort should be made to eradicate EVD in the
DRC.
Limitations of the study
The study reported in this paper has four main limitations.
First, it omits the cost of productivity time lost among
those diagnosed with EVD but do not die; health system
costs, including vaccination, tracing cases, diagnostic tests,
transport of health workers and patients (suspected and ac-
tual),  plus building and operating treatment centres (in-
cluding health workforce, medicines, medical devices); and
intangible costs of pain, grief, mental anguish and social
stigma to patients and family members [32]. In addition,
this study does not include the negative impact of fear and
stigmatisation of EVD on various socioeconomic activities, 
e.g. aviation, education (schooling), mining, tourism (hospi-
tality), etc. [33–35].
Second, strictly applied the HCA would attach a zero
monetary value on the years of life lost among the
children below minimum working age of 15 years; un-
employed adults; full-time homemakers; and retired
people [16, 36]. Even though their contribution does not
feature in GDP calculations, the last three categories of
people make an important non-monetized contribution
to the society, and thus, we valued their YLL at the net
non-health GDP per capita for DRC. With regard to
deaths among children, only the YLL above the mini-
mum working age of 15 years were valued.
Third, HCA is “..implicitly based upon the maximization
of society’s present and future production” (p. 556) [36].
Maximization of economic production is not the only rea-
son for combatting EVD. There are other reasons such as
restoring patients to health so that they can flourish, enjoy
leisure, and realize their inalienable right to health [37]. In
addition, society desires to combat EVD to reduce (or alle-
viate) fear and anxiety in the population, and pave way for
unimpeded international flow of goods and people.
Fourth, the HCA does not weigh the costs and benefits
of alternative interventions into EVD [38, 39]. Thus, its
Page 8
Kirigia et al. BMC Public Health (2019) 19:1218  Page 8 of 9
results should not be used as a basis for priority setting,
but primarily for advocacy for increased investments into
the national health system (including disease surveillance
system) and other systems that address the social determi-
nants of health.
Conclusion
The ongoing EVD outbreak in the DRC has led to the sub-
stantive monetary value of years of life lost. Therefore, there
is urgent need for DRC government and development part-
ners to disburse adequate resources to strengthen national
health system (including disease surveillance system) and
other systems that address social determinants of health
(education, water, sanitation, hygiene, cultural practices,
physical security) to end recurrence of EVD outbreaks [40].
In addition, there is a necessity for conducting eco-
nomic evaluations that identify, assess and compare the
costs and consequences associated with alternative pre-
ventive and treatment interventions for EVD. Unlike, the
evidence presented in this paper which is primarily for
use in advocacy, economic evaluation evidence would
guide priority-setting, decision-making and planning of
prevention and control actions for combatting EVD.
