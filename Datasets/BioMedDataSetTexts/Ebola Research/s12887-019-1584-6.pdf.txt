CASE REPORT  Open Access
One month follow up of a neonate born to
a mother who survived Ebola virus disease
during pregnancy: a case report in the
Democratic Republic of Congo
N. Kasereka Baraka1, Mupenzi Mumbere2* and Evie Ndombe3
Abstract
Background: The authors report a 1 month follow up of a neonate described as “miracle baby” because she was
born Ebola virus disease-free and survived after her mother was infected with Ebola virus during the third trimester
of pregnancy.
Case presentation: This female newborn baby was registered at the Maternity of Beni Reference General Hospital
and the Ebola Treatment Centre in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. She was delivered normally and showed
no signs of Ebola infection. All tests were negative for Ebola. At 1 month follow up, the baby is growing normally.
Conclusions: This very rare happy outcome for neonates of mothers infected with Ebola virus motivated the
authors to report the case.
Keywords: Case report, Ebola virus, Neonate, Pregnancy, One month follow up
Background
According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
Ebola virus disease (EVD) is a serious, highly contagious
and fatal disease in humans. The virus is transmitted to
humans from wild animals and spreads to the popula-
tion through interpersonal transmission [1].
Ebola virus disease during pregnancy is associated with
a very high rate of obstetric complications and perinatal
adverse outcomes including spontaneous abortion,
premature rupture of membranes, premature delivery,
ante- and postpartum haemorrhage, intrauterine death
of the foetus, maternal and neonatal death [2]. Neonates
born to women with Ebola virus (EBOV) are often
premature [3] and typically do not survive for more than
a few weeks [4].
The data show that intrauterine content remains
positive for Ebola virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) [5]. Since
the identification of EBOV, 15 neonates born alive to

EBOV-infected mothers have been documented. All
died; the longest documented survival was 19 days [6].
During the 2014–2016 outbreak, Médecins Sans Fron-
tières treated at least 54 EBOV-infected women with
pregnancies in the second and third trimester and
recorded 35 second-trimester miscarriages and deliveries
in Ebola treatment centres. The single baby born alive
died 2 days after birth. To date, there is only one survival
beyond neonatal period reported in the literature about
babies born to EBOV-infected women. It was a female
baby born with congenital EVD who was followed up for
12 months of life in Conakry (Guinea) and was found to
be growing normally [7]. While in a retrospective cohort
study of patients managed at 5 Ebola Treatment Units
(ETU) in West Africa, two neonates born live to EBOV-
infected women in the ETU died within 8 days [8].
Here we report a 1 month follow up of a neonate born
to a mother who survived the Ebola virus disease in
eastern Democratic Republic of Congo during the Ebola
outbreak that was declared in August 2018 and
continues to wreak havoc in the northern areas of the

Case presentation
Our patient’s mother, 22-year-old previously healthy
multigravida woman (Para 4, Gravida 6, Abortion 1, Live
children 4) was admitted to the Beni General Hospital
Ebola Treatment Center 2 days after onset of symptoms
(fever, vomiting and malaise) and was confirmed positive
for EBOV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  She
reported a 34 week pregnancy and confirmed that the
previous pregnancy follow up was uneventful. She was
discharged after 1 week of management made of
rehydration, Cefixime, Paracétamol and other supportive
measures.
At the gestational age of 38 weeks, vaginal delivery
occurred after a 10 h labor, the foetus was in breech
presentation with meconial amniotic fluid and a normal
placenta. The female newborn baby did well initially
with an Apgar score of 8/9/10. General and neurologic
examination did not reveal any pathology. The vital
signs and anthropometric parameters at birth were as
follows: temperature 36.5 °C, regular breathing at 52
cycles per minute and heart rate 146 beats per minute;
weight of 3500 g, head circumference of 36 cm and
height of 53 cm. The haemoglobin level was 16 g / dl;
the umbilical cord blood PCR, the blood and salivary
swabs were negative for the Ebola virus disease. She was
subjected to an antibiotic therapy made of cefotaxime
(3x200mg/day) and was discharged after 5 days.
At 1 month and 6 days of age, the baby was growing
normally, she weighed 4100 g (versus 4400 g ideally), she
was being breastfed and her mother reported no illness
in the past days of her life.
Discussion and conclusions
We describe a neonate who was born EBOV-free from a
mother who survived Ebola virus disease during her
pregnancy in late stage. We think that this favourable
outcome was probably due to the fact that the mother
presented a relatively mild disease phenotype which was
not transmitted to the foetus in utero.
Although information on the consequences of Ebola
during pregnancy is limited (in terms of risk factors),
early reports seemed to indicate very high mortality,
which also leads to a fatalistic approach to the pregnant
population management [5, 9]. However in a retrospect-
ive cohort study of patients managed at five Ebola treat-
ment units in West Africa, the data do not support the
idea that pregnant women are at higher risk for death
compared with nonpregnant patients with EVD [8].
According to very disturbing reports from West
Africa, pregnant women suspected of having Ebola virus
were denied access to health facilities because healthcare 
providers feared they would infect other patients.
Because of the history of an almost uniformly fatal
outcome in infants born to mothers with Ebola, these
pregnant mothers and their infants have not been given
the care needed [10]. However throughout the course of
the epidemic, the situation improved over time [8].
Although these are very rare cases, some pregnant
women have survived the Ebola virus disease without
losing the unborn child. In a medical facility in devel-
oped countries, the chances of survival of a pregnant
woman with Ebola virus disease could be high thanks to
the implementation of standard supportive care. However,
whether supportive care for neonates born to women
infected with EVD would be effective in high income
settings also remains to be seen [10].
Ebola virus disease remains a serious public health
problem because of its high mortality and the fatal ob-
stetrical and neonatal complications. Our case highlights
the possibility of delivery and survival of disease-free full
term babies born to mothers who survived the Ebola
virus disease. Thus, care should be strengthened in preg-
nant women to improve the chances of saving neonates
born in these conditions.
