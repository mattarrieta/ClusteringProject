Toward a global health approach: lessons
from the HIV and Ebola epidemics
Gilles Raguin1* and Pierre-Marie Girard2
Abstract
Background: The imposing burden of non-communicable diseases, emerging infectious diseases, climate change,
environmental consequences, migrations, urbanization, and other challenges, faced in a context that strives to make
universal health coverage (UHC) a reality, compels global health professionals to ask: how do we construct a “global”
roadmap that is both realistic and effective?
To move forward and begin to answer this question, we draw on lessons and experiences gained during the “global”
health crises triggered by the HIV and Ebola pandemics.
Main text: Improving the early response and committing to the long haul; developing inter-disciplinary and inter-
sectoral responses; designing comprehensive and versatile interventions; and, most importantly, to work closely and
effectively with civil society and communities are some of the critical elements that were identified.
The health sector has changed dramatically in recent years; new tools and innovative technologies are transforming
the culture and practice of public health. This calls for a new vision.
Reprioritizing primary health care and community engagement, repositioning approaches to meet people’s needs,
applying integrated disease management to respond to problems caused by the silo approach, implementing UHC,
and ensuring equity are some of the new strategies.
Conclusion: These strategies must all undergo a mandatory revolution in health governance—locally and globally. It
should be obvious that nothing can be improved on a global or sustainable scale without re-examining the architecture
and governance of major funding and international organizations dedicated to health.
Pressing economic, demographic, and climate issues related to health underscore the urgent need for these changes.
Keywords: HIV, Ebola, Global health
Background
100 years after its outbreak at the start of the twentieth
century in Central Africa [1], the HIV epidemic has not
ended. Although we have seen positive indicators from
the African continent, many problems continue to ham-
per controlling this pandemic.
New health challenges are appearing on the global
health landscape. The Ebola virus disease (EVD) out-
break, a cataclysmic health crisis, revealed the desperate
state of health systems in low-resource countries.
Chronic noncommunicable diseases—diabetes, cancer,
and cardiovascular diseases—kill more people today than
infectious diseases, even in Africa. Meanwhile, infectious

diseases, such as Zika, plague, and yellow fever, continue
to emerge or re-emerge. Climate change and food secur-
ity are serious concerns. And we must not forget previ-
ous scourges lurking behind the scenes, better
controlled today but still very present: tuberculosis, mal-
aria, and infant and maternal mortality.
In the face of this imposing burden, in the context of
UHC promised by the new United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals [2],  the key question confrontingglobal health professionals is: how do we construct a
“global” roadmap to health and health equity that is both
realistic and effective?
Global health, in effect, no longer prioritizes a disease,
a specific aspect of the health system, or one continent
over another, but instead focuses on improving health
and health equity for everyone on the planet. A huge en-
deavor, indeed!

Main text
Response must be early, appropriate, and sustainable
Unfortunately, under-estimating needs at the start of
epidemics and over-estimating the resulting outcomes
once the epidemic ends are consistent observations.
Nevertheless, everything is there: identifying the crisis
early on; quickly rolling out efforts and resources, with-
out being swayed by panic or denial; and committing to
the long haul.
The HIV epidemic, tracing back to the early twentieth
century followed by its “discovery” in the 1980s, was
largely under-estimated by officials at the time, by their
own admission, resulting in the loss of precious time for
an international response. Even today, the pandemic
continues to gain ground despite slowing down or even
reversing in some countries. The danger lies in celebrat-
ing too soon while letting down one’s guard. For this
reason, announcements of its eradication by 2030 are
counter-productive: it will presumably take several more
decades of effort before this pandemic is truly brought
under control, especially with the current worrisome
emergence of antiretroviral resistance.
Similarly, there is broad consensus that the local and
international response to the EVD epidemic of 2013–
2016 was both late and poorly adapted. A constellation
of factors—ignorance of or under-estimating early warn-
ings, the inertia of responsible institutions, and unsuit-
ability of the initial responses—allowed the epidemic to
reach a scale unequaled in the history of this disease.
And despite promises, too little funding is now mobi-
lized on the ground to prevent the onset of other
epidemic episodes, even as the animal reservoir, which
remains poorly understood, can be re-activated at any
moment. Health systems strengthening, in terms of
infection prevention and control, remains in its nascent
stages in most African countries, despite this serious
warning.
Acting early and appropriately also means being able
to mobilize the necessary human and financial resources,
which generally exceed what low-resource countries are
able to raise. The fight against AIDS lacked financial
support for a long time until the Global Fund to Fight
AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria was created in 2002,
followed by the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003. The recent positive trends in
the fight against AIDS in Africa are, mostly, a direct
consequence of these investments. Similarly, with Ebola,
funding was mobilized too slowly, partially explaining
the delays in combatting the epidemic. State and inter-
national NGO resources were quickly depleted, leaving 
the international community to mobilize emergency
funds solely through unstructured channels. Neverthe-
less, the lesson bore fruit with the creation, albeit late
and rudimentary, of the WHO and World Bank emer-
gency funds. However, the good news is that this epi-
demic has been controlled, with time and sustained
efforts.
Global, inter-disciplinary, and inter-sectoral responses
The fight against HIV has shown that the biomedical re-
sponse is only one aspect, necessary but insufficient, of
an effective response to pandemics. The essential role
that the humanities and social sciences play in informa-
tion, reduction of fear and stigma, prevention, screening,
treatment adherence, and control policies is well known
[3, 4]. There can be no effective response if other sectors
of society are not also mobilized: financing, education,
media and communication, security forces, and diplo-
macy. An effective public health approach is political
and engages all levels of public power and society.
Because of the errors made at its beginning, the 2013–
2016 EVD epidemic clearly showed how much the com-
bination of disciplines and sectoral interventions finally
brought the pandemic under control. Communities and
care givers paid dearly, in human lives, for the initial
lack of collaboration between biomedical actors, security
forces, anthropologists, crisis communication specialists,
animal specialists, politicians, and diplomats. Rejection
of sanitary measures imposed on populations with no
explanation or consultation, abuse of power and impris-
onment, abusive border closures, riots, and murdered
health care staff: these are some of the events that could
have been avoided or minimized by combining the
expertise and interventions of all relevant actors. The
development of a “One World, One Health” approach,
which specifically aims to unify animal and human
health actors around a single, common, “global” goal is
an excellent initiative, though still in its inception.
The response must be comprehensive and versatile on
day-one, combining prevention and treatment, delivery
of hospital care and primary health care, community
participation and international mobilization, grassroots
outreach with communities as well as sophisticated in-
terventions. International humanitarian interventions—
disparate, poorly coordinated, and even competing
against each other—often factor into the disorganized
and inappropriate management of health emergencies by
States. Westerners often apply a technologically sophisti-
cated, and sometimes dogmatic, approach that is poorly
adapted to local contexts and can even be counter-pro-
ductive when it results in marginalizing the essential role
of communities. All components of the health system
must be engaged and strengthened. The approach must
be global and coordinated while based on involving local

actors [5].  Civil society should always be a key stake-
holder in interventions, starting with their design.
The health sector has changed dramatically in recent
years, and this calls for a new vision.
Information and communication is one area where
innovations offer considerable improvements: rapid and
relevant information for public health actors and deci-
sion makers, enabling them to make decisions quickly
and early; and rapid and intelligible information for pop-
ulations, care givers, and actors overseeing health and
civil security, allowing them to better prevent the spread
of infections and their consequences. New technologies
enable this, whether at the local level with tools to en-
hance connectivity, or at the regional and even global
level, with big data, spatial data integration, and social
and scientific networks [6]. Their potential is consider-
able, as are the related issues: ownership, data manage-
ment, transparency and verification of information, and
political issues. These new tools will transform the cul-
ture and practice of public health.
The supply side of health care—how we provide health
services closest to those needing them that are best
tailored to their needs—will also see major changes. Be-
yond waking international actors up to reprioritizing
primary health care and community engagement, the
essential nature of which was rediscovered during the
Ebola crisis, major changes have begun. These include
repositioning approaches toward people’s needs, task
shifting and sharing to mitigate serious health workforce
deficits across all continents, integrated disease manage-
ment to respond to problems caused by the silo ap-
proach, UHC and equitable access to quality care and
affordable health commodities.
All these must undergo a mandatory revolution in
health governance—locally and globally. As with global
warming, it should be obvious that nothing can be im-
proved on a global or sustainable scale without re-exam-
ining the architecture and governance of major funding
and international organizations dedicated to health,
which are too vertical (devoted specifically to a single
disease or group of diseases), poorly coordinated, and in-
sufficiently integrated. In this global framework, an ap-
proach based on the concept of global public goods
seems the most appropriate. Civil society is increasingly,
and quite justly, demanding more participatory govern-
ance, both locally and globally. Lastly, in an intercon-
nected world, transnational networks, partnerships, and
coalitions—especially between international and local
NGOs—as well as economic clubs and networks are rap-
idly developing and will transform the world of health.
Here, politicians have an immense responsibility. These
rapid changes must indeed be accompanied by a revision
of legal, ethical, and societal rules and frameworks (UHC,
the right to health, participatory governance, climate and 
environment, health determinants, etc.). Delivery of health
care services must be reconfigured so the interlocking
components—care giver status and training, the health
system, social justice, transparency, and accountability—
run efficiently [7].  The nature, scope, and extent of
international conventions, agreements, and regulations
(including international health regulations) must be up-
dated. These changes are urgent as economic, demo-
graphic, and climate issues related to health become even
more pressing.
Conclusion
The key question confronting global health professionals
today is: how do we construct a “global” roadmap to-
wards health and health equity that is both realistic and
effective?
Drawing on lessons and experiences gained during the
“global” health crises triggered by the HIV and Ebola pan-
demics provides some insight and brings to the conclusion
that nothing can be improved on a global or sustainable
scale without a revolution in health governance—locally
and globally.
