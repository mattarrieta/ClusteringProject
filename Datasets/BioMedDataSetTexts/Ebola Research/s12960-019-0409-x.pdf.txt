Abstract
Background: The 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa placed greater demands on the affected countries’
already scarce health workforce. Consequently, governments in the most affected West African countries made
appeals for volunteers to join Ebola response programs. Those volunteers played an important yet high-risk role in
aiding the victims of the Ebola epidemic and in limiting its spread. However, little is known as to what motivated
those volunteers to commit themselves to the Ebola response programs. This information is important for planning
for volunteer recruitment strategies during future epidemics. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to
identify and assess the motivations that led individuals to volunteer for Ebola response programs in West Africa.
Methods: The study participants were 600 persons who volunteered through the Guinean Ebola response program
during the 2014–2016 epidemic. From February to May 2016, they were presented with a questionnaire that
contained 50 assertions referring to possible motives for volunteering in the Ebola response program and indicated
their degree of agreement with each of them on a scale of 0–10. The responses were analyzed using factor
analysis.
Results: Seven separable volunteer motivations were identified. “Feeling of patriotic duty” (M = 9.02) and “Feeling of
moral responsibility” (M = 8.12) clearly emerged as the most important. Second-tier motivations were “Compliance
with authority” (M = 6.66), “Desire to use one’s skills for a collective good” (M = 6.49), “Seeking personal growth”
(M = 5.93), “Desire to gain community recognition” (M = 5.13), and “Hoping for a career reorientation” (M = 4.52).
Conclusions: These findings strongly suggest that volunteer recruitment, if needed in future Ebola epidemics, must
adopt a multifaceted motivational approach rather than focus on one single motivator. Putting relatively more
emphasis on motivational messages referring to patriotic values, as well as to moral responsibility, would likely
increase volunteering.

Background
The 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa reached
a scale never seen before. Over 28 600 people were in-
fected with Ebola virus, and over 11 000 died [1]. During
the epidemic, the characteristics of the virus—the high
fatality rate and the high level of transmissibility—com-
bined with the chronically fragile and under-resourced
health systems to place greater demands on the affected

countries’ already scarce health workforce [2, 3]. As a re-
sult, governments in the most affected West African
countries—Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea—and a
variety of international non-governmental organizations
(e.g., Doctors Without Borders, International Red Cross
and its national societies, and International Medical
Corps) appealed for volunteers to join the Ebola re-
sponse programs [4–6].  Those volunteers were lay
people with diverse occupational backgrounds, including
students, teachers, taxi drivers, street vendors, farmers,
and artisans [5–7].  They were recruited from and
worked in their own communities; as such, they were

uniquely positioned to promote protective health behav-
iors and appropriate healthcare seeking behaviors. They
received training for a specific role in the Ebola response
programs and were incorporated into the teams of Ebola
frontline responders [5–7].  The most common roles
undertaken by those volunteers were conducting safe
burials of Ebola victims, taking Ebola patients to treat-
ment centers, cleaning Ebola treatment centers, educat-
ing the public about Ebola and what to do to prevent it,
and assisting in surveillance to detect possible Ebola
cases in their communities by, for example, screening
people for fever in public places and monitoring Ebola
contacts [6–8]. The volunteers’  contributions were crit-
ical in the response to the epidemic. For example, Tif-
fany et al. estimated that volunteers responsible for
safely burying Ebola-infected individuals averted be-
tween 1411 and 10 452 secondary Ebola infections, redu-
cing the epidemic by 4.9 to 36.5% [9].  The volunteers
took great risks for themselves and their families by join-
ing Ebola response programs: frontline responders were
21–32 times more likely to be infected with Ebola than
the general population; 815 were infected, among whom
47% died [10].  Although called “volunteers,” they were
far removed from a classic definition of a “volunteer”: “a
person who does something, especially helping other
people, willingly and without being forced or paid to do
it” [11]. Indeed, voluntary work in Ebola response pro-
gram has evolved into a remunerated activity, accom-
panied by job descriptions and titles. Although these
volunteers were not paid a salary, they received some
form of remuneration, the amount depending on the ac-
tivities and the organization, and some volunteers had
access to it and some not [12, 13].
Given the absolutely essential role of the volunteers in
aiding the victims of the epidemic and in limiting its
spread, the high risk associated with volunteering and
the certainty that volunteers would be part of the re-
sponse to future epidemics response, it is critical to
understand how best to recruit and retain volunteers. A
starting point is to examine the underlying motives that
led individuals to volunteer during the recent Ebola epi-
demic. The present study is the first to address this
issue.
Previous studies on what motivates individuals in Af-
rica to volunteer in health programs have mainly used
qualitative methods and have consistently found a wide
variety of motives. Akintola [14] interviewed 57 volun-
teer caregivers of people living with HIV/AIDS in South
Africa and identified 11 motives: (a) altruistic concerns
for others and community, (b) employment and career
benefits, (c) the desire by unemployed persons to avoid
idleness, (d) an opportunity to learn caregiving skills, (e)
an opportunity to put their own skills to good use, (f)
personal growth, (g) a means of attracting good things 
to themselves, (h) a religious calling, (i) the hope of gain-
ing community recognition, (j) a way to deal with a dev-
astating personal experience of AIDS, and (k) an effort
to improve society. Takasugi [15] used focus group dis-
cussions with 23 volunteer community health workers in
Kenya to identify their different motivational drivers: (a)
hope that the voluntary role would lead to salaried em-
ployment, (b) a desire to help improve the standard of
living and health awareness in the community, (c) a
means of gaining respect from the community, (d) hope
of receiving monetary incentives, (e) hope of gaining val-
ued items, (f) a means of obtaining preferential service
when attending a health facility, and (g) an opportunity
to learn. Kironde and Klaasen [16] found that volunteers
in tuberculosis control programs in South Africa were
motivated by (a) hope for eventual remuneration, (b) the
desire to work for the good of others, (c) the desire to
gain work experience, (d) the need to find something to
do with one’s spare time, and (e) the fact that the
community-based tuberculosis program was new.
While those previous studies highlight the diversity of
motives underlying volunteering in health programs,
they cannot help in assessing the strength of each of
those motives, in distinguishing among them as a func-
tion of their impact on volunteering and in understand-
ing the structural relations among them on the basis of
their similarities and differences. Only a few studies have
used the structural approach needed to address these is-
sues. The core propositions of this approach are that dif-
ferent volunteers pursue different goals, that the same
volunteer may have different motives, that motives to
volunteer relate to one another in a coherent and mean-
ingful way that reflects a motivational structure [17], and
that the strength of each kind of motive can be assessed
in a precise way.
Claxton-Oldfield et al. [18] examined motives for be-
coming volunteers in hospice palliative care in Canada.
They used a 65-item questionnaire that consisted of as-
sertions referring to possible motives for volunteering
and identified—based on factor analysis of the data—five
different kinds of motives: “altruism” (e.g., volunteering
is a way to help others), “civic responsibility” (e.g., volun-
teering is a way to give back to the community),  “per-
sonal gain” (e.g.,  volunteering could help with future
goals), “self-promotion” (e.g., volunteering helps to gain
attention),  and “leisure” (e.g.,  volunteering is a hobby).
“Altruism” (M = 21.44 on a scale of 0–25) and “civic re-
sponsibility” (M = 18.64) clearly emerged as the strongest
motivators, while “leisure” (M = 14.74), “self-promotion”
(M = 11.46), and “personal gain” (M = 9.46) were second-
tier motivators.
Using similar research methods and statistical analysis,
Clary et al. [19] investigated the motives of volunteers in
the United States of America in services to children, to

the families of cancer patients, to the physically handi-
capped, and to social service and public health clients, as
well as in blood services and disaster relief. They found
a motivational structure reflecting six different kinds of
motives: “to express values related to altruistic concerns
for others” (e.g., it is important to help others), “to ac-
quire learning experiences and/or exercise professional
skills” (e.g.,  gaining a new perspective on things),  “to
strengthen social networks” (e.g.,  it is important to the
people I know best), “to gain career related experience”
(e.g., get a foot in the door at a place where one would
like to work), “to reduce negative feelings about oneself
or address personal problems” (e.g.,  working through
one’s own personal problems),  and “seeking personal
growth” (e.g.,  volunteering increases self-esteem).  The
strongest motives were “to express values related to al-
truistic concerns for others” (M = 5.37 over 7),  “to ac-
quire learning experiences and/or exercise professional
skills” (M = 5.13),  and “seeking personal growth” (M =
4.64). The impacts of motives involving career opportun-
ity (M = 4.54), addressing personal issues (M = 3.25), and
strengthening personal social networks (M = 2.95) were
relatively weak.
Finally, Mousa and Freeland-Graves [20] examined the
structure of the motives of people in the United States
who volunteer in food rescue. They also found a com-
plex motivational structure with four separate motives:
“altruistic” (e.g.,  want to help community),  “social life”
(e.g., want to decrease one’s loneliness), “career improve-
ment” (e.g.,  increase career options),  and “service re-
quirement” (e.g., required for membership in their social
group).  The most prevalent motivator was altruism
(29%), followed by career improvement (28%) and social
life improvement (28%). Those who volunteered to fulfill
a requirement had the lowest score (15%).
These three studies that used a structural approach to
examine motivations underlying volunteerism focused
on contexts in which volunteering activities involved no
life-threatening risk and were conducted exclusively in
high-income countries in which volunteering conditions
are relatively good. No study has yet examined the moti-
vations of volunteers in Ebola epidemic responses, where
the high Ebola fatality rate—which varied from 25 to
90% [21], the high level of its transmissibility [21], and
the challenging working conditions of Ebola responders
in Africa [22]—make the issue of volunteering much
more challenging. The present study is the first to use a
structural approach to examine volunteerism in an Afri-
can context. The aim was to delineate the motivational
structure underlying volunteering in Ebola response pro-
grams and to measure the strength of each kind of
motive.
Our first hypothesis, based on previous studies [14–20,
23, 24],  was that at least six different kinds of motives 
for volunteering in Ebola response programs would be
found: (1) a feeling of patriotic duty, (2) a feeling of
moral responsibility, (3) a desire to use one’s skills for a
collective good, (4) compliance with authority, (5) a de-
sire to gain community recognition, and (6) a seeking
for personal growth. Our second hypothesis, based on
the devastating consequences of Ebola in the affected
poor countries in West Africa [1–3], was that the most
important motives would be patriotism and feelings of
moral responsibility toward fellow citizens and that the
contribution of the other motives would be relatively
moderate.
Methods
Study setting
The study was conducted in Guinea, a West African
country with a population of 12 609 000 [25]. Its health
system is characterized by a relative shortage of health-
care personnel and a lack of investment in the health-
care infrastructure [26]. It was one of the countries most
affected by the 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic, with 3811
cases and 2543 deaths [1].  The World Health
Organization reported 199 Ebola infections among the
country’s Ebola frontline responders, among whom 55%
died [10].  The study site was Conakry, the capital and
largest city in Guinea and one of the Ebola epicenters
[27].
Participants
Participants were Guinean citizens who volunteered
through the Guinean Ebola response program during
the 2014–2016 epidemic and worked in the district of
Matoto, Conakry. One co-author, who headed the Ebola
response program in Matoto, led the recruitment of par-
ticipants and the collection of data. In February 2016,
his team of five research assistants sent invitations to
participate in the study to all the volunteers of the dis-
trict with full explanations of the study and its proce-
dures. A total of 770 were invited and 77.9% agreed to
participate. The 600 participants (421 men and 179
women) provided informed consent. Their age ranged
from 18 to 67 years (M = 31, SD = 9.22). Overrepresenta-
tion of men in the sample reflects gender inequalities in
Guinean workforce. See Table 1 for more details about
their demographic characteristics.
Material
The material was a 50-item questionnaire that consisted
of assertions referring to reasons that could motivate
one to volunteer in Ebola response programs. The items
were devised in multiple ways. First, a list of items was
created by the investigators on the basis of previous
studies on motivations for volunteering in community
health programs [14–20, 23, 24].  This list was then

shown consecutively to two focus groups of eight volun-
teers each who, under the direction of one of the au-
thors, reformulated items judged as ambiguous and
suggested additional items. The last augmented list was
then presented to a third focus group composed of eight
other volunteers who found the assertions easy to under-
stand and made no additional suggestions.
Thirty-four of the items are shown in Table 2. The
common wording of all items—“One of the reasons I
volunteered in Ebola response programs was that
…”—was chosen to reflect the fact that several motives
can be operating at the same time or at different times
for the same person [17]. An 11-point scale was printed
following each sentence. The two extremes of the scales
were labeled “Disagree completely” (0) and “Agree com-
pletely” (10). Using a 0–10 rating scale yields sufficient
diversity in the data [28]. The language used throughout
the study was French, the official language in Guinea.
Procedure
The questionnaire was paper-based. Participants an-
swered individually in a vacant classroom in a local
school or the participant’s private home, depending on
what was the most convenient. The assistant was not
present when the participants filled out the question-
naire (in order not to influence their responses).  The
questionnaire took approximately 30 min to complete.
Full anonymity was provided to all participants. Data
collection was carried out from February to May 2016.
Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the
Guinean National Review Board for Health Research,
the Guinean National Review Board for Research on
Ebola, and the Institutional Review Board of the Univer-
sity of Quebec-TELUQ. 
Data analysis
Means and standard deviations were computed for each
item and for the whole sample. An exploratory factor
analysis was conducted on the raw data to see whether
identifiable groups of items emerged that were statisti-
cally correlated (factors). The means and standard devia-
tions of the agreement scores of the combined items of
each factor were then computed, and the effects of
demographic characteristics on scores for each factor
were assessed through analyses of variance (ANOVA).
Results
Item mean scores ranged from 2.87 to 9.19 (out of 10).
A first exploratory analysis that was conducted on the
whole set of items showed that 16 of them did not load
(< .30) on any factor or loaded on more than one factor.
These items were removed, and a second exploratory
factor analysis was conducted on the 34 remaining
items. Using the screen test—a method of deciding how
many factors should be retained in a factor analysis—we
observed seven interpretable factors with eigen-values
ranging from 1.22 to 6.87. They accounted for 50% of
the variance. This seven-factor solution was retained and
subjected to Varimax rotation—a statistical method that
enables to simplify the expression of complex items in
order to look for independent factors. Main results are
shown in Table 2.
The first factor explained 6% of the variance. It was la-
beled “Feeling of patriotic duty” since it loaded positively
on items expressing the idea that volunteering in re-
sponse to the Ebola epidemic was considered a civic
duty to end the devastating consequences of Ebola in
the country. Its mean score was very close to the max-
imum rating: 9.02 out of 10. Participants with a college
degree scored significantly higher (M = 9.16) than other
participants (M = 8.74),  p < .02. Participants who de-
clared themselves Christians scored significantly higher
(M = 9.57) than those who declared themselves Muslims
(M = 8.97), p < .02.
The second factor (7% of the variance) was called
“Feeling of moral responsibility”  because all items
expressed the idea that volunteers may have felt a moral
responsibility to help their fellow citizens infected with
Ebola. The mean score was very high (M = 8.12) and sig-
nificantly higher among participants with a college de-
gree (M = 8.29) than among other participants (M =
7.79), p < .02.
The third factor (10% of the variance) was called
“Compliance with authority” because it expressed the
idea that volunteers may have joined the Ebola response
program in order to fulfill a cultural prescription, to
comply with a religious obligation or to fulfill a political
requirement. The mean score was slightly above the
middle of the agreement scale (M = 6.66).

The fourth factor (7% of the variance) was called “De-
sire to use one’s skills for a collective good” because it
expressed the idea that volunteering in the Ebola re-
sponse program may have been seen as an opportunity
to put one’s own professional skills to make a positive
impact on the Guinean society. The mean score was also
slightly above the middle of the agreement scale (M =
6.49),  and significantly lower (M = 5.48) among partici-
pants who declared themselves Christians than among
participants who declared themselves Muslims (M =
6.69), p < .005.
The fifth factor (7% of the variance) was called “Seek-
ing personal growth” because it expressed the idea that
volunteering may have been seen as an opportunity to
gain personal growth. The mean score was also slightly
above the middle of the agreement scale (M = 5.93).
The sixth factor (7% of the variance) was called “De-
sire to gain community recognition” because it expressed
the idea that volunteers may have hoped to gain social
benefits through volunteering. The mean score was in
the middle of the agreement scale (M = 5.13) and signifi-
cantly lower among participants who declared them-
selves Christians (M = 4.39) than among participants
who declared themselves Muslims (M = 5.21), p < .05.
Finally, the seventh factor (6% of the variance) was
called “Hoping for a career reorientation” because it
expressed the idea that volunteering may be seen as pro-
viding more interesting working experience than the
current one. The mean score was slightly below the mid-
dle of the agreement scale (M = 4.52).
Discussion
The first objective of this study was to delineate the mo-
tivational structure underlying volunteering in Ebola epi-
demic response. Through factor analysis, we have been
able to identify and interpret seven separable motiv-
ational factors. This finding is consistent with previous
research [18–20] suggesting that while volunteering is
certainly driven by a great number of particular motives,
these motives relate to one another in a coherent and
meaningful way that enables the emergence of a factorial
structure. The components of this structure are not re-
dundant: When considering motivational factors such as
“Feeling of patriotic duty,” “Feeling of moral responsibil-
ity,” and “Desire to use one’s skills for a collective good,”
we are not looking at the same motives under different
guises, but are really considering three different, empir-
ically separable kinds of motives.
The other objective was to measure the importance of
each kind of motive to the volunteers. The emergence of
a factorial structure enabled measurement of the
strength of each kind of motive. As expected, the re-
spondents reported that their most important motive to
volunteer was the “Feeling of patriotic duty” (M = 9.02 
over 10). This finding supports the World Health Orga-
nization’s observation during the recent Ebola epidemic
in Liberia that “Local volunteers, who worked in treat-
ment centers, on burial teams, or as ambulance drivers,
were driven by a sense of community responsibility and
patriotic duty to end Ebola and bring hope back to the
country’s people” [29].  With the devastating conse-
quences of Ebola in the affected poor countries in West
Africa, governments’  Ebola response emphasized patri-
otic consciousness. Presidents of affected countries pre-
sented the epidemic as a threat to the nation’s economic
and social fabric [29] and announced several wartime
measures including state of emergency declarations, cur-
fews, national border closings, and military deployment
[30]. Mass campaigns presented the epidemic as threat-
ening the survival of the country, as illustrated in posters
stating “Ebola c’est la guerre” [Ebola it’s a war] and call-
ing for mobilization of all citizens for the “war” against
Ebola [31].  Citizens were encouraged to take an active
role in the response to the epidemic by adopting and
promoting protective behaviors against the virus, while
local media portrayed Ebola response as a test of citi-
zens’ patriotism [32].
As also expected, the respondents reported that “Feel-
ing of moral responsibility” was another strong motiv-
ator for volunteering, indeed their second-ranked
motivation (M = 8.12). This motive was already identified
as a common reason for volunteering in community
health programs in Kenya [15] and Botswana [33]. Com-
mitting oneself to conduct safe burials for fellow citizens
who died by Ebola, to help those who are infected with
Ebola to get access to treatment centers, or to educate
the others about what to do to prevent the virus appears
to be the way some Guinean people chose to respond to
feelings of moral responsibility toward their fellow citi-
zens. While using patriotic rhetoric to encourage citi-
zens’  mobilization for the epidemic response,
governments in Ebola-affected countries in West Af-
rica did not resort to mandatory prescriptions. Thus,
citizens who volunteered were free moral agents who
were truly willing to help. Those volunteers may
have felt they were personally concerned with the
epidemic since the victims were their family mem-
bers, their friends, their neighbors, or at least their
fellow citizens. This concern for the victims may
have strengthened the volunteers’  sense of group be-
longing in the face of Ebola and increased their feel-
ings of moral duty to join the epidemic response
program. This interpretation is in accord with the
Common Ingroup Identity Model [34] which sug-
gests that prosocial intergroup responses increase
when members of different groups (e.g.,  patients in-
fected with Ebola vs volunteers) can see themselves
as part of the same group.

The third most highly rated factor was “Compliance
with authority” (M = 6.66). This finding is corroborated
by those of previous studies [14, 33, 35]. Volunteers in
community health were motivated by calls from religious
leaders in South Africa [14], traditional chiefs in Uganda
[35],  and the government in Botswana [33].  Influential
community figures such as traditional chiefs, spiritual
authorities, and political leaders played major roles in ef-
forts to motivate people to volunteer for the Ebola re-
sponse programs in Guinea and the other affected
African countries [36].
“Desire to use one’s skills for a collective good” was
the fourth most highly rated factor (M = 6.49).  This
motive has been reported by volunteers involved in
HIV/AIDS care in South Africa [14] and in an
immunization program in Uganda [37]. In a context of
high unemployment rates in Ebola-affected African
countries [38],  involvement in volunteering activities
may be seen as an opportunity for unemployed persons
to make use of their professional skills.
The fifth most highly rated factor was “Seeking per-
sonal growth” (M = 5.93). This motive was identified in
Takasugi et al.’s work on motivations for volunteering in
community health in Kenya [15].  Previous studies sug-
gest that volunteering has impacts on the lives of the
volunteers, including personal growth, an increase in
self-esteem, and learning how to keep things in perspec-
tive [39, 40].
“Desire to gain community recognition” was the sixth
most highly rated factor (M = 5.13). Consistent with this
finding, community health volunteers in South Africa
[14],  Kenya [15],  and Uganda [35] have reported that
their commitment to volunteering was driven by a hope
of gaining community recognition. Some volunteers in
Uganda acknowledged that volunteering helps them to
take up roles in local government [35],  while Arab
women volunteering in the Women’s Health Program in
Israel indicated significant positive changes in their so-
cial status [41].
Finally, “Hoping for a career reorientation” (M = 4.52)
was also an identifiable motive but had the least impact
on volunteering. This motive was previously reported by
community health volunteers in South Africa [14].
Owing to the high unemployment rate and poverty in
Guinea, many Guineans may have felt coerced to take
jobs that were below their professional skills. Those
workers were likely not making full use of their potential
and may have seen volunteering as an opportunity to
help them to reorient their careers.
While the study provides important perspectives about
motives for volunteering for Ebola epidemic response, a
number of limitations highlight the need for caution in
interpreting the data. First, the sample was composed of
Ebola response volunteers who lived and worked in one 
specific area during the epidemic. This study’s results
must, therefore, be generalized with care to volunteers
from other areas of the country or other parts of Africa.
Second, while the use of a self-reported measure enabled
us to find a clear motivational structure that can be eas-
ily replicated, this might have introduced social desir-
ability bias in the responses if participants wanted to
claim socially desirable values and deny socially undesir-
able ones. However, this seems unlikely because the par-
ticipants knew that their answers were completely
anonymous and studies have shown that allowing people
to answer questions completely anonymously decreases
a person’s motivation to distort reports in socially desir-
able directions [42, 43]. That said, the present findings
should be regarded as preliminary and future research
should verify these results using methods that excel
completely in preventing social desirability bias. Third,
the researcher did not ask further questions to elucidate
the reasons underlying respondents’  ratings. This study
would be strengthened by follow-up studies using quali-
tative methods that sought to further elucidate the rea-
sons underlying each of the identified motives. Fourth,
the lack of information about participants’  professional
background did not enable to assess the veracity of mo-
tives referring to “Desire to use one’s skills for a collect-
ive good.” Finally, given that volunteerism in Ebola
response program has evolved into a remunerated activ-
ity, it seems likely that gaining financial benefits has
been a motivator among many volunteers.
Conclusions
This study sought to identify and assess the motivations
behind volunteering for Ebola response programs in
Guinea. Its findings are the first that could help inform
policymakers in Guinea and probably in other African
countries, about how to devise and organize strategies for
the recruitment and retention of volunteers during future
Ebola epidemics. The structural approach helps shed light
on the various motives of the volunteers and appreciate
the strength of each of those motives. The results showed
that each of the identified motives had a significant impact
on volunteering. These findings strongly suggest that vol-
unteer recruitment strategies must be multifaceted rather
than focused on one single motivator. When implement-
ing those strategies, policymakers should, however, put
relatively more emphasis on motivational messages refer-
ring to patriotic values, as well as to moral responsibility
toward fellow citizens. At an individual level, recruiters
may be able to use the motives identified in this study to
detect which ones would drive a particular individual and
to adapt their recruitment messages accordingly. Finally,
while strategies presented above may help increase volun-
teerism, policymakers must also take into account the
reality that adequate expectation management regarding

remuneration or incentives is essential, to sustain motiv-
ation [44].
