Abstract
Background: Liberia is among the three west African countries which were crippled by the Ebola Virus Disease
(EVD) outbreak of 2014. One of the programs which was affected by the EVD outbreak was the National Leprosy
and Tuberculosis Control Program (NLTCP). Determining the magnitude of the impact of EVD on the NLTCP
performance is crucial in restoring the service and in devising effective post EVD strategies. The purpose of the
study was to analyse the impact of EVD outbreak on the performance of the NLTCP of the Ministry of Health (MOH)
OF Liberia.
Methods: A cross sectional study design was conducted in 2016 using both quantitative and qualitative methods.
Quantitative data was used for the Tuberculosis (TB) program evaluation before EVD (2012–2013) and during EVD
(2014–2015). Qualitative data was used to complement the data obtained for the quantitative study. Descriptive
statistical analyses of quantitative data were conducted using Microsoft Excel.
Results: Notified TB cases of all forms decreased from 7822 in 2013 to 4763 and 6118 in 2014 and 2015 respectively.
The number increased to 7180 and 7728 in 2016 and 2017 respectively. The TB treatment success rate was 71 and 61%
in 2014 and 2015 respectively compared to the 83% in 2013. The treatment success rate was 77% in 2016. The loss to
follow up (LTFU) was as high as 47% in some regions which were highly affected by the EVD outbreak. The national
average LTFU was 5–10% in 2012–2013 and 16 and 21% in 2014 and 2015 respectively. The percentage of TB patients
with known HIV result decreased from 75% in 2013 to 74 and 42% in 2014 and 2015 respectively. TB culture and drug
susceptibility testing service was interrupted throughout the outbreak. The results of the focal group discussions and
interviews conducted in our study also indicated that the TB case finding and the TB treatment outcome was
significantly affected by the EVD outbreak.
Conclusion: Notified TB cases and treatment outcome was significantly affected by the EVD outbreak which occurred
in 2014 and 2015 in Liberia. Effective restoration strategies should be developed in order to improve the TB case
finding and treatment outcome.

Background
TB is a major public health problem worldwide. It af-
fects the health of approximately 10 million people each
year and is one of the top ten causes of death worldwide.
TB is the ninth leading cause of death worldwide
exceeding death from HIV/AIDS [1].  According to the
World Health Organization (WHO) report of 2017; the
TB incidence in Liberia for the year 2016 was 308/100,
000 population compared to 242/100,000 in 2000 [2].
Liberia is among the high TB burden countries in Sub-
Saharan Africa. The NLTCP of Liberia was well func-
tioning starting from its establishment in 1989 under the
Department of Preventive Health Services of the Minis-
try of Health and Social Welfare with TB case detection
rate of above 60% and TB treatment success rate of
above 70% between the 1990 and 2000 [3, 4]. Although
few cases of TB were detected between 2005 and 2007,
an increase in notification was observed from 2008 to
2012 notably because of the expansion of the program
through funding from the Global Fund. The TB case no-
tification of all forms was, 3456,4514 and 4511 in 2005,
2006 and 2007 respectively. The notification increased
to 5007 and 8132 in 2008 and 2012 respectively.
In Liberia, the treatment success rate was 76% in 2009
[4, 5]. This figure was by far less than the national and
global targets of 85% set by the Stop TB strategy of
WHO [6]. Treatment success rate is the number of new
smear-positive pulmonary TB cases registered in a speci-
fied period that were cured plus the number that com-
pleted treatment divided by total number of new smear-
positive pulmonary TB cases registered in the same
period. Treatment outcome includes treatment success
rate, LTFU, death rate and transfer out [7].
The recent west Africa EVD outbreak was first
detected in Guinea in March 2014 and spread to the
neighbouring countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone. As
the result of this deadly outbreak, 28,616 cases and 11,
310 deaths were reported in West Africa. Among this,
11,000 cases and 4800 deaths were reported in Liberia
[8].  EVD is a severe, zoonotic, filovirus infection and
life-threatening disease which spreads through direct
contact with body fluids of a sick person with EVD [9].
Direct contact with the deceased person’s body during
funeral or burial preparation is another means of trans-
mission for the virus [10].  The 2014 west Africa EVD
outbreak was the largest and longest Ebola epidemic and
the first to occur in three entire neighbouring countries.
The pre-existing health system of the three countries
was already fragile before the outbreak due to years of
armed conflict and poor economic status. This was
further aggravated by the outbreak as result of death of
health workers, fear of infection, closure of health facil-
ities, delayed response of international community and
stock out of medical supplies [11]. The devastating EVD 
outbreak in the three countries impacted significantly
on all sectors of the healthcare systems including the
TB prevention and control programs [12].  The out-
break hampered the diagnosis and treatment of HIV,
malaria, TB and other diseases. Outpatient attendance
was decreased significantly for fear of infection at the
health facilities. Border closures, disruption of transpor-
tation route and curfew made access to routine medical
services difficult [13].
In Liberia, the EVD outbreak began in March 2014
and caused a devastating impact on the health system,
the population at large and the Liberian economy. As
result of the 14 years of civil war which was started in
1989, the health system was on recovery and ill equipped
to effectively respond to the epidemic with the necessary
health facilities. The infection prevention measures,
laboratory infrastructure and health work force were not
in a position to contain the outbreak [14]. As a result of
the existing weak infection prevention measures, the
EVD epidemic had a 30 times higher risk of infection
amongst Liberian health workers as compared to the
general population, with 372 health workers infected,
and 180 health workers died as of 18th March 2015 [15].
In addition to the weak infection prevention measures,
the pre-existing structural vulnerabilities that aggravated
the outbreak included inadequate and poorly motivated
staff, insufficient and unsuitable infrastructure and
equipment, weak supply chain and poor quality of care.
During the EVD outbreak patients were screened and
treated for EVD according to the WHO guidelines. All
patients including presumed and confirmed TB were
screened for fever at entry to each health facility. Any
patient presenting with unexplained hemorrhage, or with
a fever or who had been in contact with a known Ebola
case, or an ill or dead animal, was referred to the Ebola
Treatment Center in Liberia [16, 17].
Even though the exact magnitude of the impact of the
EVD outbreak on TB was not exactly determined in
Liberia, the health facility closures, community distrust,
fears and refusal of health workers to provide routine
health services has critically impacted the health service
delivery. As a result, there were disruptions in provision
of routine services. These disruptions have affected the
entire health services. One of the programs which was
affected by the EVD outbreak was the NLTCP. This was
due to the temporary closure of the health facilities, fear
and stock out of medical supplies. The impact of EVD
on the health sector in general and TB in particular was
studied in Sierra Leone and Guinea but it was not well
studied in Liberia. The study findings from both coun-
tries indicated a decline in TB case notification and TB
treatment outcome [13, 18]. This study is the first of its
type in Liberia to exhaustively analyze the impact of
EVD on TB case finding and treatment outcome in

Liberia. It attempted to address the challenges caused by
EVD with the ultimate aim of improving the TB treat-
ment outcome to reduce Liberia’s TB-related mortality
and morbidity rates with advantages for the individual
TB patients and their families during the EVD outbreak
and post EVD health service recovery. The study also
provided recommendations to the National TB program
on how to improve the post EVD TB treatment outcome
and TB case finding and to effectively control future
outbreaks and keep the momentum towards achieving
the End TB strategies set by WHO for 2035 [6, 19].
Methods
Study design
A cross sectional study design was used for the study
conducted in 2016 using both quantitative and qualita-
tive study methods. Quantitative research design was
used for the TB program evaluation before EVD (2012–
2013) and during EVD (2014–2015). Quantitative study
design was used for the study on the impact of EVD on
TB program treatment outcome and case finding using
the data obtained from TB program. NLTCP treatment
outcome and laboratory diagnosis (2009–2017) data was
extracted from the Ministry of Health of Liberia health
management information system, NLTCP of Liberia
documents and reports using a standard self-developed
and piloted checklist. The data extracted included TB
case notification rate, TB treatment outcome, TB/HIV
co-infection trends and TB treatment success rate.
The qualitative study included two Focus Group
Discussions (FGDs) and one semi structured interview
questionnaires. The purpose of conducting these inter-
views and FGDs was to understand the real experience of
the participants in evaluating any impact of EVD on TB
program performance. The findings of these qualitative
data analysis are considered to supplement the findings of
the quantitative study.
Study setting
The study was conducted in Liberia. Liberia is located in
West Africa and is bounded by Guinea in the north,
Cote d‘Ivoire in the east, Sierra Leone in the west and
the Atlantic Ocean in the south. The country has a
population of 4.3 million. The study setting included the
NLTCP of Liberia where the TB program performance
data was obtained. Besides, TB annex hospital which is
co-located with NLTCP in Monrovia were used as study
setting for the qualitative data collection.
Study participants, sampling and data collection
The impact of EVD on TB program performance was
evaluated from TB program managers and staff perspec-
tive. The study participants were selected using purposive
sampling. Participants included TB program managers, 
county health team officers, county diagnostic supervisors,
laboratory heads, nurses and laboratory technicians work-
ing in TB hospital, pharmacist and administrative staff.
The qualitative data collection methods included individ-
ual interviews and FGDs. Two FGDS each composed of
10 people were included in the qualitative part of the
study. The FGDs were facilitated by a moderator and the
FGDs discussions were captured on the FGD guide. In
addition to this, semi-structured interview questionnaires
were conducted by the principal investigator. The inter-
view participants were program managers, county health
team officers, different facility TB staffs and county diag-
nostic officers. Altogether, 30 respondents participated of
the 35 who consented. All the interviews and FGDs were
conducted in English; the national language of Liberia.
Data analysis
Thematic content analyses were performed on the qualita-
tive data based on the FGD guides and semi-structured
interview guide. Content analysis was used as it enables a
systematic coding of data by organizing the information
into categories to discover patterns undetectable by merely
reading the transcripts. Inductive categories of themes and
sub-themes emerged from the transcripts were used to
draw original and unbiased conclusions. Direct quotes
from the group discussion participants were not reported
as each quote is captured in the themes and sub-themes.
For the quantitative data, descriptive statistical analyses
were conducted using Microsoft Excel.
Ethical considerations
A written permission letter for TB program data and to
conduct the study was obtained from the National
Leprosy and Tuberculosis program of Liberia. Prior to
conducting the study, permission was obtained in the
form of a clearance certificate from the National Ethics
Board of Liberia. Written consent was obtained from the
FGD and interview study participants. Confidentiality
was ensured at all stages of the study as no identifying
details were written on the questionnaires, check lists
and FGDs to link anyone to the data obtained. No infor-
mation was given to third party without the permission
of the Ministry of Health of Liberia.
Results
Performance of the TB laboratory diagnosis during the
EVD outbreak
The TB laboratory network in Liberia consists of one
referral laboratory, one central laboratory, five regional
laboratories and 167 peripheral microscopy service sites.
The TB case notification of the NLTCP of Liberia before
and during the 2014 EVD outbreak is shown below
(Figs. 1 and 2). Notified smear positive cases of TB were
3820 in 2013 and dropped to 2448 during the 2014

heightened outbreak of EVD in Liberia. TB case notifica-
tion had been increasing since 2011 but declined in 2014
and 2015.The TB case notification was in 2013 was 7822
and declined to 4763 and 6118 in 2014 and 2015
respectively. The number of TB cases notified increased
to 7188 and 7728 in 2016 and 2017 respectively. The 
impact of the 2014 EVD outbreak on smear positive TB
cases and on TB treatment success rate was analyzed
using the interrupted time series analysis. Regression
analysis with Newey -West adjusted standard errors was
used to evaluate the impact of the 2014 EVD on smear
positive TB cases. For smear positive cases, there was a

significant change of level of the variable TB positive
smear cases as well as in the trend of the number of
cases of this variable (Fig. 3). This trend in notified TB
cases clearly indicated that the decline in 2014 and 2015
was attributed to the EVD outbreak.
TB/HIV coinfection and collaboration efforts were also
analyzed before and after the EVD outbreak to deter-
mine the impact of the outbreak on HIV testing of TB
patients. In addition to this, the percentage of HIV + TB
patients started or continued on Cotrimoxazole Prevent-
ive Therapy (CPT) and the percentage of HIV+ TB pa-
tients started or continued on Anti- Retroviral Therapy
(ART) were compared before and after the EVD out-
break. The % of HIV + TB patients started or continued
on CPT decreased during the outbreak but the % of HIV+
TB patients started or continued on ART increased during
the outbreak as indicated below (Table 1).
Laboratory diagnostic supervisors’  perspectives of the
impact of EVD on TB laboratory diagnosis.
This is a qualitative study where one FGD was
conducted to get insight on the impact of EVD on TB
laboratory performance from diagnostic supervisors’
perspective. A total of 10 county diagnostic supervisors
participated in the FGD discussion. The work experi-
ences of the participants were 6 to 20 years. There are
15 county diagnostic supervisors in Liberia who are
assigned one per county. Of the 15 county diagnostic
supervisors, 10 participated. The main themes that
emerged from the FGD participants on the impact of
EVD included TB laboratory diagnosis interruption as a
result of facility closure for fear of EVD, priority was 
given to EVD and TB laboratory services were compro-
mised. Besides, poor knowledge on the nature and trans-
mission mechanism of EVD was another theme emerged
during the FGD discussion. The sub-themes included
work load as some laboratory technicians were reposi-
tioned for EVD response and lack of incentives and con-
tinuous stock out of laboratory reagents and supplies.
FGDs were also asked to share their experience on the
impact of EVD on Tuberculosis case finding. All the
FGD participants mentioned that EVD affected the TB
laboratory services in various ways. Most of the FGDs
participants explained that the closure of the health
facilities for fear of EVD crucially affected the TB ser-
vices in their respective counties. The repurposing of re-
sources to fight Ebola including logistics and man power
was associated to the EVD impact on TB case finding by
FGD participants. The lack of incentive to health
workers including laboratory staff during the outbreak
was argued by an FGD participant as the main cause of
the negative impact on TB laboratory performance.
Besides; the care given to the infected national staff was
not intensive as those of infected expats and this was
also discouraging as mentioned by an FGD participant.
Impact of EVD on TB treatment outcome
TB treatment success rate is considered as one of the of
TB program treatment outcome indicators which help

rate of Liberia was also declined to 71% in 2014 and 61%
in 2015 (Fig. 4). The TB treatment success rate increased
to 77% in the year 2016 and 2017. Regression analysis
using Newey -West adjusted standard errors showed no
significant change both in the level of the variable treat-
ment success rate and in the trend of this variable
(Fig. 5). This indicated that Treatment success rate was
not affected significantly during the 2014 EVD outbreak.
TB treatment outcome of cured rate, completed rate,
failure rate, death rate and LTFU rate were also used as
measures of the impact of EVD on TB treatment out-
come. The most important cause of unfavourable out-
come in Liberia after the EVD outbreak was the LTFU
which was 7% in 2013 and became 16 and 21% during
2014 and 2015 respectively. The LTFU became 13% in
2016. The information obtained from the interview re-
spondents and FGD participants of this study also indi-
cated that the LTFU was as high as 47% in some regions 
of Liberia which were highly affected by the EVD out-
break in 2014. This was attributed to facility closures for
fear of EVD and service interruption during the outbreak
as indicated by the FGDs and interview respondents of
our study. This had nevertheless by far increased from
the national average LTFU rate of 9, 6, 4% in the 2010,
2011and 2012 respectively (Table 2).
NLTCP and TB hospital staff’s perspectives of the impact
of EVD on TB treatment outcome
To get more insight of the impact of TB on EVD
treatment outcome, one focal group discussion with 10
participants was included in the qualitative study. The
composition of the FGD included two nurses, pharmacist,
two medical doctors, two physician assistants, counselor
nurse, laboratory technician and data clerk. The FGDs for
this part of the study were selected purposively from each
unit of the TB Annex hospital. The minimum years the

FGD participants service in the TB referral hospital was 3.
This was helpful to get in depth understanding of the pro-
gram performance from the facility point of view and the
impact of EVD on their facility performance. The main
themes that emerged during the FGD discussion were
interruption of TB facility service for fear of EVD, lack of
logistics for TB service and lack of knowledge on the na-
ture and transmission of the EVD and infection preven-
tion mechanism. Stigma and denial were also mentioned
as sub-themes. The other subthemes emerged were lack
of government incentive for staff at high risk of infection,
low salary, high staff turnover and poor service at the facil-
ity before the EVD outbreak.
FGD participants were also asked and discussed their
experience on the impact of EVD outbreak on TB treat-
ment outcome. Almost all participants explained that

TB treatment outcome was highly affected by the EVD
outbreak. They further explained that there was high
rate of treatment interruption, failure and LTFU. FGD
participants also indicated that EVD being a public health
emergency during the outbreak, resources were prioritized
to fight EVD and this also highly compromised the TB
services.
The FGD participants provided the following recom-
mendations on how to improve the post EVD TB treat-
ment outcome in their facility as well as nationally.
 Improve the supply of TB drugs and laboratory
reagents
 Initiate the interrupted GeneXpert and TB culture
and drug susceptibility testing
 Build trust by ensuring safety of health workers and
health facilities
 Improve the TB infection prevention from the
lessons learnt from EVD Infection prevention
practice
 Assess facility needs and filling their gap
 Involve the community to create awareness about
TB so as to improve TB treatment adherence which
was affected by EVD.
In addition to the two FGDs, Interview were conducted
by the principal investigator using semi-structured
interview guide. The interviews were conducted with TB
program managers, county health team officers and
county diagnostic officers as part of the qualitative study.
The interview included 30 participants. The number of
Page 8
Desta et al. BMC Public Health (2019) 19:1221  Page 8 of 10
interview respondents who strongly agreed that EVD
significantly impacted the TB laboratory diagnoses and
treatment outcome of Liberia were 25(85%). Among the
30 interview respondents, 5(15%) associated the impact of
EVD on TB laboratory diagnosis and treatment outcome
to the existing poorly funded fragile health system before
the EVD outbreak. The interview with the program man-
agers at NLTCP also supported the later argument that
there was some delay in the release of funding by Global
fund. According to the interview respondents; the EVD
outbreak also happened at the time where the TB pro-
gram was writing the Global Fund to fight TB, AIDS and
Malaria (GFTAM) round ten proposal. The delay from
the GFTAM on the approval of the proposal was one
impact. After this only extension grant was available
throughout the EVD outbreak. The implementation of the
proposed activities was delayed. The TB laboratory ser-
vices including GeneXpert, Culture and drug susceptibility
testing were interrupted during the outbreak and most of
the data report indicated that TB smear was not done.
Without a laboratory result, it was very difficult to meet
the global case detection and treatment success rate of 70
and 85% respectively. The interview respondents further
explained that the logistic and supply support from The
MOH for the TB program was also critically affected by
the outbreak and affected the program activities.
Discussion
This is among the few studies conducted in the EVD
affected west Africa countries to show the impact of
EVD on the health service delivery. The findings of
the study indicated that EVD negatively impacted the
TB case finding and treatment outcome of Liberia.
The first finding of our study was a sharp decline in
the TB case notification of both smear positive TB
cases and all forms of TB during the EVD outbreak.
According to the FGD and interview participants of
our study, the interruption of the routine TB sputum
smear microscopy, TB culture, susceptibility testing
and GeneXpert MTB/RIF during the outbreak were
the main reason for the decline in TB case notifica-
tion. Our findings were similar to the study findings
of similar research conducted in Sierra Leone but dif-
ferent from the study findings in Guinea [18, 20].  A
significant drop in case notification was observed in
2014 compared to 2015. In 2015, the health facilities
were re-opened and the basic services were restored
including the TB diagnosis and treatment. As result,
there was an increase both in notified forms of all TB
as well as notified cases of smear positive TB.
The findings of our study also indicated that the TB
treatment outcome was significantly affected by the EVD
outbreak. The treatment success rate of Liberia declined
by EVD from 83% in 2013 to 71% in 2014 and 61% in 
2015. This was lower than the Stop TB strategy target of
85% and by far lower than the End TB WHO target set
after the Stop TB [6, 19]. This decline in treatment suc-
cess rate was attributed to the high rate of LTFU of TB
patients during the outbreak. The LTFU increased from
7% in 2013 to 16 and 21% in 2014 and 2015 respectively.
The LTFU decreased to 13% in 2016 indicating an
improvement in the performance of the TB program
following the end of the outbreak. The TB treatment
success rate also increased to 77% in 2016. Our study
finding was similar to a study finding in Sierra Leonne
[18].  The main reasons for the high LTFU deducted
from the FGD participants and interview respondents of
the study were closure of health facilities during the out-
break, decreased patients’  health facility visit for fear of
EVD, treatment interruption, lack of laboratory reagents,
poor knowledge of EVD and lack of standard infection
prevention system at health facilities. The Ministry of
Health of Liberia’s situational analysis of the post EVD
health service indicated that more than 40% of health fa-
cilities across Liberia that previously provided TB diag-
nostic and treatment services were closed down between
May and August 2014 [15]. A study conducted in West
Africa also explained that the 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak
in west Africa crippled the healthcare systems of the
three countries, hampering diagnosis and treatment for
endemic diseases such as malaria, HIV/AIDS and Tuber-
culosis [13, 21]. The death of health workers, closure of
many health facilities and fear of EVD transmission af-
fected the routine health service delivery including TB
and HIV [22, 23]. During the EVD outbreak the percent-
age of TB patients who were tested for HIV declined to
3567(74%) and 2577(42%) in 2014 and 2015 respectively
from 5899 (75%) in 2013. It was only starting from the
end of 2014 to the first quarter of 2015 that the outbreak
reached its peak. People might have been afraid of infec-
tion and restrained from attending health facilities in the
year 2015. The percentage was 74% for the year 2016
showing a significant increase after the outbreak.
Percentage HIV positive TB patients started or
continued on CPT was only 8% in 2010 and reached
74% in 2013 as per the data of NLTCP of Liberia.
This service was also highly affected during the EVD
outbreak and decreased to 56 and 47% in 2014 and
2015 respectively. Our findings as well as the findings
from similar study indicated that HIV testing among
TB patients, which relies on the finger-prick test
which was not recommended during an Ebola outbreak,
decreased, leading to a reduction in the number of
individuals diagnosed with HIV [13].  Shortcomings in
ascertaining HIV status affected the uptake of both CPT
needed for preventing opportunistic disease and ART [5].
Our findings were similar to the study conducted by
Alyssa et al. [13].

Despite the significant impact of the 2014–2015 EVD
outbreak, The NLTCP was not on hold with all TB
service delivery being uninterrupted. This is the most
encouraging experience during the outbreak. This was
due to the commitment of the MOH of Liberia and
international partners who stayed on the ground and
continued their support throughout the outbreak. A
study conducted in Guinea on the effect of EVD on TB
program performance showed that TB program activities
and performance were sustained, all TB facilities
remained open, no stock out of TB drugs as result of the
presence of enhanced health systems support to uphold
TB services by international partners [23]. This was en-
couraging lesson and in stark contrast to other health set-
tings in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia where the study
findings indicated negative impact on TB treatment
outcome, treatment success rate and HIV testing of TB
patients, TB drug stock outs, high rate of loss to follow
up, facility closures and death of health workers [24, 25].
Recommendation
The National Leprosy and Tuberculosis Control pro-
gram of Liberia should conduct country wide service
readiness assessment and situational analysis to improve
the EVD affected TB services delivery of the country and
develop strategy that will sustainably restore the pro-
gram. This will enable the program to continue its mo-
mentum before the EVD outbreak and meet country
specific as well as global TB program performance tar-
gets. The NLTCP should align its outbreak preparedness
and restoration strategies with the Ministry of Health
and other sectors as EVD and another epidemic out-
break can happen in the region as result of expanding
probable virus reservoirs. The experience gained from
the 2014–2015 EVD outbreak can be used to prevent
and contain similar outbreaks that may happen in the
region by implementing effective surveillance and pre-
paredness strategies.
Scope and limitations of the study
Our study only included TB case finding and TB
treatment outcome data. It could have been significantly
improved by including other TB program data such as
the TB program financing. Besides, TB program per-
formance data from Guinea and Sierra Leonne; the other
two EVD affected countries should have been included
to provide regional perspective of the outbreak.
The findings of the study clearly indicated the impact
of EVD on the TB treatment outcome and laboratory
diagnosis of the NLTCP of Liberia. Every single aspect
of the TB treatment outcome and case finding may not
be reflected on the study but the major areas that reflect
the overall TB treatment outcome and laboratory per-
formance of the program were addressed. The qualitative 
study interview and one of the two FGDs were conducted
in the most populated city of the country, Monrovia
where more than 50% of the population of Liberia lives.
The other counties were not included in this part of the
study though the other components of the study included
the entire country. This was considered as one methodo-
logical limitation of the study. The other methodological
limitation of the study was the use of focus group discus-
sion as an instrument for the qualitative part of the study;
the participants might have felt peer pressure to give simi-
lar answers which might have affected the data obtained
from the discussion.
Conclusion
Our study findings indicated that that the National
Leprosy and Tuberculosis Control Program of Liberia
TB service delivery and treatment outcome was drastic-
ally affected by the 2014–2015 EVD outbreak and it
should device effective and sustainable restoration strat-
egies to address this critical bottle necks, meet national
and global TB program targets and effectively contain
similar outbreaks that may happen in the future.
