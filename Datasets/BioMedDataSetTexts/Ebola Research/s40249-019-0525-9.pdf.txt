Abstract
Background: The 2014–2016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa was the largest outbreak of Ebola virus disease
(EVD) in history. Clarifying the influence of other prevalent diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus
infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) will help improve treatment and supportive care of
patients with EVD.
Case presentation: We examined HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody prevalence among suspected EVD cases
from the Sierra Leone-China Friendship Biological Safety Laboratory during the epidemic in Sierra Leone. HIV and
HCV antibodies were tested in 678 EVD-negative samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A high HIV
prevalence (17.6%) and low HCV prevalence (0.22%) were observed among the suspected cases. Notably, we found
decreased HIV positive rates among the suspected cases over the course of the epidemic. This suggests a
potentially beneficial effect of an improved public health system after assistance from the World Health
Organization and other international aid organizations.
Conclusions: This EVD epidemic had a considerable impact on the public health system and influenced the
prevalence of HIV found among suspected cases in Sierra Leone, but also provided an opportunity to establish a
better surveillance network for infectious diseases.

310 deaths by June 2016 [1]. Sierra Leone, as one of the
least developed countries in the world, was one of the
three countries most seriously impacted during the out-
break. Clarifying the influence of other prevalent dis-
eases such as HIV/AIDS will help improve treatment
and supportive care of patients with EVD [2].
The Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Survey in
2008 and 2013 showed that 1.5% of Sierra Leonean
adults aged 15–49 years were HIV-positive and that the
HIV prevalence was slightly higher among women
(1.7%) than men (1.3%) [3, 4].  However, some groups
had reported that these rates were dramatically underes-
timated. From November 2014 to March 2015, sus-
pected EVD-patients were admitted to the Sierra
Leone-China Friendship Hospital in Sierra Leone and

assessed for EBOV infection via real-time polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) test of blood samples. Out of 278
EBOV-negative patients, 44 (15.83%) were diagnosed as
HIV-positive [5].  During the same period at Moyamba
Ebola Treatment Center (ETC), Sierra Leone, three out
of 44 EBOV-negative patients (8.8%) were HIV-positive
[6].  To further understand HIV prevalence among sus-
pected Ebola cases in Sierra Leone, we tested blood sam-
ples for the presence of HIV antibodies among suspected
EVD patients at a biosafety level-3 laboratory, examined
the prevalence of HIV, and analysed the probable correl-
ation between HIV and EVD epidemic in Sierra Leone.
Case presentation
From March to November 2015, the Sierra Leone-China
Friendship Biological Safety Laboratory received a total
of 901 blood samples collected from 731 EVD-suspected
patients. Of these samples, 94 from 53 individuals were
EBOV positive as confirmed by real-time PCR, while
807 samples from 678 individuals tested EBOV negative
by real-time PCR. The 678 EBOV-negative samples were
first tested for HIV antibodies using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA; Beijing Wantai Biological
Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) and then
retested using another ELISA reagent (Zhuhai Livzon
Diagnostics Inc., Zhuhai, China). HIV positivity was de-
fined as having positive results in the two tests [7]. The
EVD-negative samples were also tested for hepatitis C
virus (HCV) antibodies via ELISA (Beijing Wantai Bio-
logical Pharmacy Enterprise Co., Ltd., Beijing, China).
All data were entered into a Microsoft Excel spread-
sheet (2016, Microsoft, Redmond, USA).  All data ana-
lyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Frequency analyses were used to
calculate the HIV-antibody and HCV-antibody positivity
rates among all EBOV-negative patients and subgroups.
Chi-square tests were used to compare differences be-
tween subgroups. Chi-square trend tests were used to
evaluate the trend of HIV prevalence. Pearson’s correl-
ation coefficient analyses were used to evaluate the cor-
relation between the monthly HIV prevalence and
reported Ebola cases. Differences with P-values less than
0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Of the 678 EBOV-negative patients, 55.7% (372/668)
were male, while 44.3% (296/668) were female (Table 1).
Regarding age distribution, the 0–14 year age group con-
stituted 24.7% (162/656), the 15–49 year age group consti-
tuted 63.1% (414/656), and the 50-year-old or older age
group constituted 12.2% (80/656) of the entire cohort. Re-
garding geographical distribution, 64.9% (440/678) was
from the Western Urban area, 29.8% from the Western
Rural area, and 5.3% from other or unknown areas.
Among EBOV-negative patients, the mean
HIV-antibody positivity rate was 17.6%,  with 11.3% in 
males, 25.7% in females, 2.5% in 0–14 age group, 24.6%
in 15–49 age group, 7.5% in 50 years old or older group,
14.8% in Western Urban group and 22.8% in Western
Rural group (Table 1). In our study, the distribution fea-
tures of HIV prevalence by gender and age were consist-
ent with the previous reports in Sierra Leone and other
African countries [8]. This may be related to the differ-
ent characteristics of multiple sexual partners and con-
dom usage in populations with different gender and age
distributions. For the HCV antibody test, only one posi-
tive sample was detected, indicating a low HCV preva-
lence (0.22%).
We then evaluated the HIV positivity rate among the sus-
pected EVD cases. From March to July 2015, the preva-
lence of HIV infection among the suspected EVD cases was
22.5% and over 16% per month, including up to 36% in
May. From August to November 2015, the prevalence was
9.8% and less than 16% per month, including zero in No-
vember. From April to November 2015, the prevalence of
HIV infection among the suspected EVD cases showed a
significant decrease (P < 0.001) in Chi-square value and a
significant correlation with the monthly-reported number
of EVD cases (r = 0.745, P = 0.034) by Pearson’s correlation
coefficient analyses (Fig. 1).
Discussion and conclusions
The 2014–2016 EVD outbreak in West Africa resulted
in the disruption of an already fragile but essential health
service and drug distribution system. Particularly, HIV
clinical services in affected countries were also affected
[9].  The death of several healthcare workers in early
2014, as well as the strain on healthcare facilities caused
by increased numbers of EVD patients and decreased
numbers of staff, resulted in the closure of many clinics
and the interruption of routine health delivery services,
including HIV testing, antiretroviral therapy (ART) [10],
prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV [11],
childhood vaccination, and maternity care. This may im-
pact on other infectious diseases, such as AIDS, malaria,
tuberculosis, and measles [12, 13].  A recent computa-
tional simulation model has estimated a 50% reduction
in ART coverage and 10% increase in AIDS-related
deaths attributable to this EVD outbreak in Sierra Leone
from March 2014 to March 2015 [14]. Thus, HIV/AIDS
patients may have been inclined to visit the ETCs for
medical care during the EVD outbreak.
From January to July 2015, the EVD outbreak en-
tered the second phase of the response, during which
great efforts were undertaken by the World Health
Organization (WHO) and partners, including enhan-
cing capacities for case finding, increasing efforts for
contact tracing, and community engagement. Strength-
ened surveillance and response systems resulted in
many suspected EVD patients suffering from other

diseases visiting ETCs. Thus, many suspected EVD
cases were indeed HIV/AIDS-positive as they exhibited
many of the same symptoms and/or because many
AIDS patients had defaulted their treatments. During
the second half of 2015, with the help of the WHO
and other international assistances including the
support from Chinese Center for Disease Control and
Prevention, the overarching goal of interrupting the
remaining chains of EBOV transmission was
completed, and the public health system was being 
re-established. Moreover, the public health situations
in Sierra Leone had improved to respond to the
surveillance of several other dominant infectious
diseases, including malaria and HIV/AIDS. Thus,
HIV-infected persons may now visit the HIV/AIDS
service units again. Before admission to ETCs,
HIV-infected persons were differentiated from sus-
pected EVD cases using specific tests. Accordingly, this
may have led to a decreased HIV-positive ratio among
EVD suspected cases.
Fig. 1 The prevalence of HIV among EBOV-negative EVD-suspected cases tested at Sierra Leone-China Friendship Biological Safety Laboratory,
Sierra Leone, 2015. After its establishment in early 2015, the Sierra Leone-China Friendship Biological Safety Laboratory was responsible for EBOV
testing of EVD-suspected patients from most districts of the country. From March to November 2015, 678 individuals were excluded from EBOV
infection by real-time PCR method. HIV antibodies in the sera were tested using ELISA (with kits from Beijing Wantai Biological Pharmacy
Enterprise Co., Ltd., Beijing, China, and positive cases were confirmed using kits from Zhuhai Livzon Diagnostics Inc., Zhuhai, China). The
significant decreases (P < 0.001 in Chi-square tests) in HIV prevalence ratio among the Ebola RNA negative suspected Ebola cases in each month
are shown as brown lines and diamond symbols. The monthly reported number of Ebola cases in Sierra Leone by the WHO are shown as blue
lines and diamond symbols ([URL: "http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.ebola-sitrep.ebola-summary-latest?lang=en"] http://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.ebola-sitrep.ebola-summary-latest?lang=en) and were significantly correlated with
the reported monthly number of Ebola cases (r = 0.745, P = 0.034) using Pearson’s correlation coefficient analyses. EBOV: Ebola virus; EVD: Ebola

In conclusion, our study indicates an interaction be-
tween the EVD outbreak and other important infectious
diseases prevalent in the same area. The 2014–2016
EVD epidemic had a considerable impact on the public
health system and influenced the prevalence of HIV
found among suspected EVD cases in Sierra Leone.
However, it also accelerates the establishment of a better
surveillance network for infectious diseases. During the
post-EBOV era, a passive surveillance system was insuf-
ficient for identifying more cases of HIV infection. Other
innovative and effective strategies should be imple-
mented to expand HIV testing in Sierra Leone. A
well-established disease control and prevention system
in Africa will make invaluable contributions to global
health.
