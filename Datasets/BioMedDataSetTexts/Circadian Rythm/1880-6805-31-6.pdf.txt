REVIEW  Open Access
Prioritizing sleep for healthy work schedules
Masaya Takahashi
Abstract
Good sleep is advantageous to the quality of life. Sleep-related benefits are particularly helpful for the working
class, since poor or inadequate amounts of sleep degrade work productivity and overall health. This review paper
explores the essential role of sleep in healthy work schedules and primarily focuses on the timing of sleep in
relation to the work period (that is, before, during and after work).  Data from laboratory, field and modeling studies
indicate that consistent amounts of sleep prior to work are fundamental to improved performance and alertness in
the workplace. In addition, planned naps taken during work maintain appropriate levels of waking function for
both daytime and night-time work. Clearly, sufficient sleep after work is vital in promoting recovery from fatigue.
Recent data also suggest that the time interval between shifts should be adjusted according to the biological
timing of sleep. Although sleep is more likely to be replaced by job and other activities in the real life, research
shows that it is worthwhile to revise the work schedules in order to optimize sleep before, sometime during and
after the work period. Therefore, we suggest establishing work-sleep balance, similar to work-life balance, as a
principle for designing and improving work schedules.

Introduction
Advances in sleep research have produced a consider-
able amount of data regarding the role of sleep in all
areas of life, including the workforce. Working indivi-
duals account for approximately half of the population
in most countries, which emphasizes the significance of
sleep for this particular group. At a worker level, inade-
quate sleep leads to a wide range of health disorders [1].
Also, sleep problems are associated with short- and
long-term sickness leave [2] and further interfere with
return to work following these absences [3,4]. In the
long run, poor sleep causes work disability [4] and early
retirement [5].  Furthermore, disrupted sleep dose-
dependently increases the risk of all-cause mortality in
working men [6]. In reference to cause-specific mortal-
ity, severely disturbed sleep may be associated with a
greater suicide risk, even after accounting for depressive
symptoms [6]. This finding is highly relevant to the
situations in Japan, with over 30,000 people committing
suicide every year since 1998 [7]. Sleep problems are
also a safety concern because they are associated with

occupational injuries, as shown in both cross-sectional
and prospective studies [8,9].
We believe it is important to address sleep-related
occupational hazards from not only an individual per-
spective, but from a workplace perspective. At the work-
place level, recent findings highlight the economic
burden caused by employees with insufficient and/or
poor sleep [10-12]. Although many differences exist
among studies, sleep-related costs in the workforce are
within a similar monetary range of approximately a few
thousand dollars per person per year [10-12]. Impor-
tantly, due to the significant costs and the large number
of workers affected, employers experience substantial
economic damage from sleep-related problems.
Despite the clear disadvantages as listed above, the
value of sleep has been somehow neglected. The decline
in interest among occupational safety and health experts
may occur because they view sleep as a ‘private activity’
outside of work. Consequently, the attitude towards
sleep contrasts with the attitude towards work hours
and stressors, even though both are critical to the qual-
ity of work.
The present review explores the essential role of sleep
in healthy work schedules. This paper particularly
focuses on when workers sleep, including before and

after an assigned working period, and napping during
the work shift.
Sleep before work: preparation for enhanced productivity
Employees have the responsibility to be at their mental
and physical best during a work shift. Achieving ade-
quate amounts of sleep prior to work is a key factor
contributing to productivity. In this context, the prior
sleep wake model proposed by Dawson and McCulloch
provides a simple, yet effective framework [13]. This
model requires a certain minimum duration (X and Y
hours, respectively) of sleep during the 24-hour and 48-
hour period prior to work, in order to prevent errors
and accidents during wakefulness from awakening to
end of work. Currently, X and Y are assumed to be 5
and 12 hours, respectively.
The validity of the proposed model has been tested
across multiple work settings. For example, fatigue-
related accidents by truck drivers were accurately pre-
dicted by X = 6.5 and Y = 8 hours [14]. Data among train
industry employees (for example, train drivers, control-
lers and guards) showed that extreme tiredness or
exhaustion was significantly associated with sleep dura-
tion 24 hours prior to work, shift length, night shifts and
workload, and that such symptoms were assumed to be
reduced by 12% if the sleep was increased by one hour
during that 24-hour period [15]. In airline crews, poor
operational performance and increased errors were sig-
nificantly associated with less than 6 hours of sleep in the
24 hours prior to work [16]. Similarly, miners who took
less than 6 hours of sleep in the prior 24-hour period
performed a psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) signifi-
cantly slower than miners who had adequate sleep [17].
We also used the prior sleep wake model to analyze
truck driver data and found that drowsy driving and/or
motor vehicle crashes increased when drivers had 5 or
fewer hours of sleep in the 24-hour period prior to the
start of driving (Figure 1) [18].
Many workers experience chronic partial sleep depri-
vation over weekdays. Experimental evidence indicates
that repeated partial sleep deprivation, even achieving 5
to 6 hours of night’s sleep, causes a gradual impairment
in neurobehavioral performance each day [19,20].
Extending sleep duration prior to partial sleep depriva-
tion may counteract the subsequent impairments in per-
formance. Indeed, a recent study showed that 10-hour
time in bed (TIB) (approximately 8-hour total sleep
time [TST]) for one week prior to seven days of sleep
restriction (3 hours per night) yielded better PVT per-
formance and electroencephalogram-defined alertness
than spending 7-hours TIB (approximately 6-hour TST)
the week before sleep restriction [21]. Moreover, the
aforementioned sleep extension facilitated recovery in
performance and alertness following sleep restriction.

crashes, the upper 95% CI was 6.61 in the < 5-hour sleep, 9.68 in
the 5-hour sleep, and 5.83 in the ≥ 9-hour sleep groups.
These findings suggest that banking extra sleep may be
an effective coping strategy to ensure work performance
and to improve the recovery when one anticipates a per-
iod of by chronic sleep deprivation.
Taken together, research demonstrates that acquiring
an appropriate amount of sleep is a fundamental com-
ponent to work productivity. We are not allowed to go
to work while intoxicated; physiologically, skipping sleep
has similar influences on the brain and body as drinking
alcohol [22]. Consequently, we should not be allowed to
work when we are sleep deprived. More attention
should be directed to achieving appropriate and suffi-
cient amounts of sleep prior to one’s work shift.

Naps during work: maintenance of on-the-job
performance
Generally, employees are not entitled to take naps dur-
ing their work periods. Napping is often confused with
dosing off, which tends to be viewed as a counterpro-
ductive behavior. However, planned naps, if taken dur-
ing working hours, are recognized as a promising
technique in maintaining job performance and alertness
[23-26]. Particularly, a brief (that is, 15 to 20 minutes)
nap improves waking function [23,27,28] and is ideal for
employees, given the limited opportunity for napping in
the workplace. Recent neuropsychological research sup-
ports this idea and has indicated that the nap-related
gains in learning and memory may be potential mechan-
isms for improving cognitive function [29,30].
In addition to the neurobehavioral benefits, planned
napping may have favorable impacts on worker health.
Based on results from a cohort study of over 23,000 par-
ticipants, men who took 30-minute naps occasionally or
napped at least three times per week showed a 50%
decrease in their risk of coronary-related mortality
(hazard ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.32 to 0.83)
[31]. Interestingly, this association was stronger for
working men at enrollment (hazard ratio 0.36, 95% con-
fidence interval 0.16 to 0.77) than for non-working men
at enrollment (hazard ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval
0.33 to 1.21). Although the specific underlying mechan-
isms for these findings remain unclear, several immuno-
logical studies have revealed that while one night’s sleep
deprivation increased a proinflammatory cytokine (IL-6),
a 2-hour nap (2 p.m. to 4 p.m.) significantly reduced
this effect. Moreover, the IL-6 level continually
decreased following the nap period [32]. Similarly, sleep
restriction of only 2 hours a night decreased immunolo-
gical parameters, while the addition of a 30-minute day-
time nap facilitated immunological recovery [33].
Appropriate use of napping is thought to be more
beneficial for night and shift workers [23]. Indeed, when
a nap schedule was integrated into the work shift of
medical interns, those that napped slept longer while
on-call and experienced less fatigue compared to interns
that did not have a nap schedule [34]. Concurrently,
research with health care workers showed that a 30-
minute opportunity for napping in the middle of a night
shift (2 a.m. to 3 a.m.) improved PVT performance and
subjective sleepiness compared with no nap [35]. Find-
ings from qualitative research with hospital nurses sug-
gest that naps prove restorative during night shifts and
that naps are necessary to achieve a high quality of care
[36]. Many health care professionals who work at night
and shift-work suffer from musculoskeletal disorders.
Recent findings among nursing home caregivers indicate
that taking a nap at least once every two night shifts
was significantly associated with reduced pain in the 
neck, arm and leg, though not low back pain (Figure 2)
[37].  These data imply that protecting the time for
night-shift napping may also be effective in preventing
work-related musculoskeletal injuries.
Importantly, naps are beneficial for a variety of work-
ers, in addition to those in the health care industry.
That is, international airline pilots take in-flight naps
according to their perceived level of fatigue, which
reiterates the use of naps as a preventive measure [38].
In addition, night shift air traffic controllers given a 40-
minute nap opportunity displayed better PVT perfor-
mance and objective measures of alertness compared to
controllers in the no-nap condition [39]. The similar
favorable effects of a nap have been recognized for car
driving [40].
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in
the possible link between shift work, night shifts in par-
ticular, and cancer [41]. This concern is corroborated by
the fact that the International Agency for Research on
Cancer categorized ‘shift work that involves circadian
disruption’ as probably carcinogenic to humans (Group
2A) [42]. Exposure to environmental light during the
night shift suppresses melatonin, which is thought to be
responsible for an increased cancer risk [43,44]. If so,
taking a night-shift nap in a darkened room may exert a
protective role against cancer through the reduction in
light exposure; however, this hypothesis has yet to be
examined.
The above arguments support the active use of naps
during daytime and shift work periods. Sleep inertia
(SI), transient decreases in performance and alertness
that occur immediately after awakening, is sometimes
regarded as a barrier to worksite napping [36]. However,
we are able to minimize the negative effects of SI by
providing either additional time after the nap, or by
adjusting the nap duration, in order to restore the cen-
tral nervous system function [45]. Therefore, although
the effects of SI cannot be ignored, the value of on-the-
job napping is important to overall function and should
be considered in the workplace.
Sleep after work: recovering from fatigue
It is undisputable that sleep plays a vital role in one’s
recovery following a work period [46]. Chronic partial
sleep deprivation studies emphasize the need for ade-
quate sleep each and every night [19,20]. Unfortunately,
the reality is that work and other activities are often
completed at the expense of sleep. Several worksites in
Japan have implemented a ‘no-overtime day’ in the mid-
dle of the week (for example, on Wednesday). Neverthe-
less, no empirical data are available regarding its effects
on health, sleep or performance.
As it may be difficult to get adequate sleep every
night, the second best opportunity for taking a sufficient

sleep may be on weekends. We tested the hypothesis
that extended sleep during weekends would improve
performance and alertness during the subsequent week-
days in daytime workers, specifically in those with habi-
tually limited sleep (6 hours or less) [47]. One concern
related to sleep extension on weekends is the ‘Blue-
Monday effects’, which is the impaired waking function
during the first half of the subsequent week due to
delays in circadian phase by sleeping in on the weekend
[48]. To minimize these effects, participants in the inter-
vention condition were instructed to stay in bed for ≥ 8
hours between 10 p.m. and 9 a.m. and were prohibited
from taking a daytime nap on weekends (Friday, Satur-
day and Sunday). Participants in the control condition
were asked to keep their normal weekend sleep-wake
pattern.
As depicted in Figure 3 (bedtime, wake time and
TST), participants successfully adhered to the study,
with the high quality of sleep measured by sleep effi-
ciency. As expected, PVT performance on the Monday
following the intervention condition was significantly
better than the performance in the control condition.
Interestingly, the opposite pattern was observed on
Thursday. The explanations for these results are not yet
clear, but an important factor may be the return to the
habitual shorter sleep duration (approximately 5 hours
TST) during the post-intervention week. In other words,
the benefits of weekend sleep extension might have
been maintained, if the participants had continued to
achieve sufficient sleep during the week.
Particular care needs to be given to post-shift night
sleep in order to support optimal recovery [49]. A long
interval from a shift to the next shift is thus required.
This feature may be critical to recovery, as sleep and
health indicators have improved with the change from a
fast, forward-rotating three-shift schedule (two days on
each shift followed by four days off) to a slow, back-
ward-rotating schedule with intermediate days off
between shifts (three days on each shift followed by
three days off prior to the next shift) [50].
Another important variable to consider is the indivi-
dual differences in response to displacement of sleep
disruption or sleep restriction [51,52].  Preliminary
results assessing sleep recovery following four successive
night shifts showed that there are at least four types of
recovery: rapid, slow, pseudo and incomplete types (Fig-
ure 4) [53]. The recovery types were not associated with
morningness-eveningness, the quality of daytime sleep
during the night shift period, PVT performance or sub-
jective sleepiness during the simulated night shifts.
Instead, the inter-individual differences were associated
with the participants’ sleep habits, more specifically the
timing of sleep (bedtime and the variability of wake
time).

The latest findings demonstrate that not only is the
length of shift interval (or days off) important, but that
circadian timing should also be considered [54]. The
same interval length between shifts does not necessarily
exert the same recuperative power in regards to the
Page 6

Page 6 of 9
time of day when the shift interval occurs. Although the
current principles of shift work and working time
recommend a certain length of rest (for example, 11
successive hours) [55,56], additional revisions can be
made to accommodate the circadian viewpoint [49].
In summary, work schedules should be designed to
incorporate a sufficient time interval after every work
period to promote sleep recovery. Moreover, the timing
and duration of the rest interval need to be adjusted to
account for shift requirements and circadian rhythms in
order to ensure optimal recuperation.
Future directions
In a perfect world, employees would be very well pre-
pared for demanding schedules such as shift work and
long work hours. However, even in this ideal view, it is
likely that some portion of employees will still experi-
ence health risks. The important point is to detect sub-
optimal health conditions and then to take appropriate
action. In this regard, assessing sleep and alertness may
provide useful information. In the previous study,
nuclear power plant operators who displayed poor 
adaptation to their assigned work shift showed elevated
sleep disturbances across sleep periods and unfavorable
results on various outcomes compared to operators in
the well-adapted group (Table 1) [57]. Moreover, poor-
adaptors reported decreased alertness during shifts,
especially night shifts, compared to their well-adapted
colleagues (Figure 5).
Physiologically, melatonin (for example, dim light mel-
atonin onset) and body temperature may become candi-
dates for health evaluations assessing the response to
work schedules. These parameters, however, are easily
masked by environmental conditions [58]. Additionally,
it is quite difficult to establish normal levels under con-
tinuously perturbed work, sleep and light-dark cycle. In
contrast, profiling clock genes is expected to be a break-
through method for assessing work schedule-related
damages to health [59,60]. More research is needed to
determine its validity and feasibility.
Given the large variability in recent work schedules,
biomathematical modeling may be a valuable tool to
predict how sleep and performance are maintained
[58,61]. Enhanced communication and collaboration is

needed between laboratory experiments and field studies
to address the improvements and sophistication of the
given models.
Finally, a large portion of sleep research has focused
on the negative consequences of sleep disruption or
restriction, such as impaired health and decreased job
performance. To better disseminate the importance of
sleep to employers and many stakeholders, research
should focus more on the benefits of obtaining adequate
sleep. Several lines of evidence did demonstrate that
sleep should be optimized to make employees more
healthy and creative [62-64].
Conclusions
Numerous research findings so far support the idea that
that inadequate sleep is detrimental to both workers and
the workplaces. Although further studies are needed to
establish a specific causal relationship, action should be
taken to protect employees, employers and stakeholders
against sleep-related disadvantages. Work schedules
affect every aspect of working life; improper scheduling
may result in sleep restriction and/or disturbance, which
could then lead to dire consequences for everyone.
However, work schedules can be modified to ensure
that workers are able to get optimal levels of sleep
before, sometime during, and after the work period.
Although work-life balance has received much attention,
here we propose that work-sleep balance, through the 
creation of healthy work schedules, is equally essential
for improved working life.
