REVIEW  Open Access
Pathophysiology and pathogenesis of circadian
rhythm sleep disorders
Akiko Hida*,  Shingo Kitamura and Kazuo Mishima
Abstract
Metabolic, physiological and behavioral processes exhibit 24-hour rhythms in most organisms, including humans.
These rhythms are driven by a system of self-sustained clocks and are entrained by environmental cues such as
light-dark cycles as well as food intake. In mammals, the circadian clock system is hierarchically organized such that
the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus integrates environmental information and
synchronizes the phase of oscillators in peripheral tissues. The transcription and translation feedback loops of
multiple clock genes are involved in the molecular mechanism of the circadian system. Disturbed circadian
rhythms are known to be closely related to many diseases, including sleep disorders. Advanced sleep phase type,
delayed sleep phase type and nonentrained type of circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSDs) are thought to result
from disorganization of the circadian system. Evaluation of circadian phenotypes is indispensable to understanding
the pathophysiology of CRSD. It is laborious and costly to assess an individual’s circadian properties precisely,
however, because the subject is usually required to stay in a laboratory environment free from external cues and
masking effects for a minimum of several weeks. More convenient measurements of circadian rhythms are
therefore needed to reduce patients’  burden. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of
CRSD as well as surrogate measurements for assessing an individual’s circadian phenotype.

Mammalian circadian clock system
The circadian clock system regulates daily rhythms of phy-
siology and behavior, such as the sleep-wake cycle and
hormonal secretion, body temperature and mood [1].
These rhythms are entrained by environmental cues, light-
dark (LD) cycles and food intake. In mammals, the master
clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypotha-
lamus incorporates environmental information and coor-
dinates the phase of oscillators in peripheral cells, tissues
and organs [2,3]. Light is one of the most potent environ-
mental cues that enable the organisms to adapt to the 24-
hour environmental LD cycle. Photic signals are delivered
from the eye to the SCN via the retinohypothalamic tract,
thereby mediating the entrainment of the circadian clock
system [4]. The circadian clock system involves transcrip-
tion-translation negative feedback loops of multiple clock
genes and posttranscriptional modification and 
degradation of clock proteins [4-6] (Figure 1). The basic
helix-loop-helix and Per-Arnt-Sim transcription factors
CLOCK and BMAL1 form heterodimers and activate tran-
scription of Period 1 (Per1), Per2, Per3, Cryptochrome 1
(Cry1),  Cry2 and retinoid-related orphan receptor a
(Rora), Rorb, Rorg, Rev-Erba and Rev-Erbb by binding to
E-box motifs on their promoter regions. PER and CRY
proteins gradually accumulate in the cytoplasm and phos-
phorylation of PER and CRY occurs with casein kinase Iδ
(CKIδ) and CKIε. PER, CRY and CKI proteins form com-
plexes that translocate to the nucleus and interact with
CLOCK-BMAL1 heterodimers, thereby inhibiting tran-
scription of the Per, Cry, Ror and Rev-Erb genes. Mean-
while, Bmal1 transcription is regulated positively by
retinoid-related orphan receptor (ROR) and negatively by
REV-ERB via the ROR element (RORE) motif on the
Bmal1 promoter.

drive, interact with each other and regulate the sleep-
wake cycle [7]. The sleep-wake cycle is controlled by
sleep homeostasis. The desire to sleep increases gradu-
ally with extended wakefulness and decreases during
sleep. Additionally, sleep and wakefulness occur in turn,
and the timing of their occurrence is controlled by the
circadian clock system. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders
(CRSDs) are defined by a persistently or recurrently dis-
turbed sleep pattern. CRSD is attributed etiologically to
alterations of the circadian timekeeping system and/or a
misalignment between endogenous circadian rhythm
and exogenous factors that affect sleep timing [8]. The
intrinsic circadian period (τ, the free-running period of
circadian rhythms in the absence of external cues) is
considered to be a critical factor in the pathophysiology
of CRSD [9,10].
Familial advanced sleep phase type
Familial advanced sleep phase type (FASPT) is an auto-
somal dominant genetic disease characterized by extre-
mely early involuntary sleep timing. A missense
mutation in the PER2 gene has been identified in a large
pedigree with FASPT. This mutation caused a change
from serine to glycine at amino acid 662 (S662G) 
located in the CKIε binding domain of the PER2 protein
and resulted in decreased PER2 phosphorylation [11].
Transgenic mice carrying the mutant S662G PER2 gene
showed a shorter free-running period, τ [12]. In addi-
tion, a missense mutation in the CKIδ gene was found
in another FASPT pedigree. The substitution of threo-
nine with alanine at amino acid 44 of CKIδ reduced
enzymatic activity of CKIδ, leading to decreased phos-
phorylation level of PER2, a target of CKI [13]. The
CKIδ T44A mutation shortened τ, as well as the PER2
S662G mutation, in mice. It was previously proposed
that decreased phosphorylation of PER2 stabilizes the
PER2 protein, thereby enhancing nuclear accumulation
of PER2 and leading to a shorter circadian period.
Recent studies, however, have shown that decreased
PER2 phosphorylation enhances destabilization of PER2
by increasing turnover and degradation of PER2 [14,15].
These findings suggest that the shortening of τ observed
in the FASPT models results from enhanced turnover of
nuclear PER2 caused either by increased degradation or
by reduced nuclear retention. FASPT patients have been
reported to have a shorter period of physiological
rhythms [16]. Several studies have indicated that the
phosphorylation status of circadian clock proteins plays

a critical role in regulating circadian periods [17,18].
Altered τ seems to contribute to the pathogenesis of
CRSD.
Delayed sleep phase type
Delayed sleep phase type (DSPT) is characterized by the
inability to fall asleep and awaken at a desired time,
leading to significantly later sleep onset and wake times.
The pathophysiology of DSPT is attributed to longer τ,
misaligned phase relationship between endogenous
clock and sleep-wake cycles, reduced photic entrain-
ment and/or altered sleep homeostasis. The human
PER3 gene has multiple missense polymorphisms that
cause amino acid substitution and a variable number
tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism that encodes
either four or five copies of eighteen amino acids [19].
Association studies have shown that the longer allele
(five copies) in PER3 VNTR polymorphism (PER35) is
associated with extreme morning preference and that
the shorter allele (four copies) is associated with
extreme evening preference and DSPT [20].  PER35
homozygotes have been reported to show increased
slow-wave sleep in non-rapid eye movement sleep and
θ/a activity during wakefulness compared to homozy-
gotes for PER34 [21].  These results suggest that the
PER3 polymorphism may be linked to homeostatic reg-
ulation of human sleep. The mouse Per3 gene was
thought to be dispensable for circadian rhythm, as
PER3-deficient mice did not show altered expression
patterns of circadian clock genes in the SCN or altered
behavioral rhythm [22]. However, PER3-deficient mice
have recently been reported to have a shorter τ and
advanced phase of Per1 rhythm in peripheral tissues
compared to wild-type mice. The results suggest that
Per3 may play a role in regulating circadian rhythms in
the periphery [23]. Another group has found that PER3-
deficient mice had a lower light sensitivity and sug-
gested that Per3 may be involved in the light input
pathway [24]. These findings imply that the function of
the PER3 gene may contribute to the interaction
between the circadian system and sleep homeostasis.
Nonentrained type (free-running type)
Nonentrained type is characterized by sleep timing that
occurs with a 30-minute to 1-hour delay each day.
Nonentrained sleep-wake patterns are usually observed
in totally blind people [25-27],  whereas the none-
ntrained patterns are rarely observed in sighted people.
It is likely that blind individuals have free-running
rhythms due to the loss of photic reception (photic
entrainment). Because the τ in humans is not extensively
longer than 24 hours (average τ = 24.18 hours) [28] and
sighted people are capable of perceiving photic signals,
impaired photic entrainment as well as prolonged τ may 
underlie the pathophysiology of sighted patients with
the nonentrained type.
Evaluation of individual circadian phenotypes
FASPT, DSPT and nonentrained type of CRSDs are
thought to result from malfunction and/or maladapta-
tion of the circadian system. Evaluation of an indivi-
dual’s  circadian phenotype is indispensable to
understanding the pathophysiology of CRSD. Individual
subjects are required to stay in a laboratory environment
free from external cues during a couple of weeks’ time
to assess circadian rhythms precisely [28-30].  First,
rhythmic characteristics of physiological functions (core
body temperature, plasma melatonin and plasma cortisol
levels) are measured to estimate individual circadian
phases. Blood samples are collected over a 40-hour per-
iod under constant routine (CR) conditions where mask-
ing effects (for example, physical movement, food intake,
ambient temperature and light intensity) are minimized
(first CR).  Next, patients undergo a 28-hour forced
desynchrony (FD) protocol (9.33-hour sleep and 18.67-
hour wake cycle) followed by a 40-hour CR (second
CR). Individual circadian phases are assessed again dur-
ing the second CR. The intrinsic circadian period, τ, is
determined by the difference in circadian phase between
the first and second CRs. As described herein, the CR
and FD protocols are laborious and costly to perform in
a clinical setting. More convenient measurements of cir-
cadian phenotypes are required to reduce the patients’
burden.
Surrogate measurements for assessing circadian
phenotypes
Most cells in peripheral tissues as well as cells in the
SCN are equipped with circadian clock components.
Brown et al. developed a lentiviral luminescence assay
system using biopsy samples to measure individual cir-
cadian rhythms in fibroblasts [31]. Primary cells derived
from skin biopsy samples were introduced with a circa-
dian reporter: the Bmal1 promoter-driven luciferase
gene (Bmal1-luc). The luciferase activity under the con-
trol of the Bmal1 promoter showed robust daily
rhythms in individual primary fibroblast cells. Bmal1-luc
rhythms were monitored for several days, and rhythmic
characteristics of the luminescence rhythms were evalu-
ated. Independently, we measured clock gene expression
in primary fibroblast cells established from individual
skin biopsies and observed robust Bmal1-luc rhythms
(Figure 2). Brown et al. found that extreme morning
types had shorter periods of fibroblast rhythms com-
pared to extreme evening types [32]. Furthermore, they
compared the period length of fibroblast rhythms with
that of physiological rhythms in the same subjects and
observed a significant correlation between the two

rhythms. However, they did not observe long fibroblast
periods in blind subjects, who had significantly longer
physiological rhythms than sighted subjects [33]. The
prolonged physiological period observed in the blind
subjects may be caused by their previous sleep-wake
cycles under constant darkness. The unaltered fibroblast
period may be attributed to experimental conditions.
Although the reason for this discrepancy is not yet fully
understood and further studies are required, surrogate
measurements using fibroblast cells should be a power-
ful tool for assessing individual circadian properties.
Conclusions
Evaluation of circadian phenotypes is indispensable to
understanding the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of
CRSD. Because conventional protocols for examining
individual circadian characteristics are laborious and
costly, more convenient measurement methods are
required in the clinical setting. The circadian reporter
Bmal1-luc showed robust daily rhythms in primary
fibroblast cells derived from individual skin biopsies. 
The fibroblast rhythms are associated with chronotypes
(morningness vs eveningness preference) and physiologi-
cal rhythms. Surrogate measurements using fibroblast
cells would be a powerful tool for the assessment of
individual circadian properties and could lead to provid-
ing personalized medicine for CRSD.
