Abstract 
The development of safe and effective combination antiretroviral therapies for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
infection over the past several decades has significantly reduced HIV-associated morbidity and mortality. Additionally, 
antiretroviral drugs have provided an effective means of protection against HIV transmission. Despite these advances, 
significant limitations exist; namely, the inability to eliminate HIV reservoirs, the inability to reverse lymphoid tissues
damage, and the lack of an effective vaccine for preventing HIV transmission. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of
therapeutics and vaccines for eliminating HIV reservoirs and preventing HIV transmission requires robust in vivo mod-
els. Since HIV is a human-specific pathogen, that targets hematopoietic lineage cells and lymphoid tissues, in vivo
animal models for HIV-host interactions require incorporation of human hematopoietic lineage cells and lymphoid
tissues. In this review, we will discuss the construction of mouse models with human lymphoid tissues and/or hemat-
opoietic lineage cells, termed, human immune system (HIS)-humanized mice. These HIS-humanized mouse models
can support the development of functional human innate and adaptive immune cells, along with primary (thymus) 
and secondary (spleen) lymphoid tissues. We will discuss applications of HIS-humanized mouse models in evaluating
the safety and efficacy of therapeutics against HIV reservoirs and associated immunopathology, and delineate the
human immune response elicited by candidate HIV vaccines. In addition to focusing on how these HIS-humanized
mouse models have already furthered our understanding of HIV and contributed to HIV therapeutics development, 
we discuss how emerging HIS-humanized rat models could address the limitations of HIS-mouse models.

Background
Despite combination antiretroviral therapy (cART)-
mediated suppression of human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) replication and promotion of immune reconstitu-
tion in patients, HIV-associated morbidity persists and is
associated with the latent reservoir, unresolved immune
abnormalities, and fibrosis in lymphoid organs [1].

Additionally, HIV transmission remains endemic across
the globe, and development of a functional cure and/or
an effective vaccine will be required to end this epidemic
[2]. HIV is a human specific pathogen; thus, animal mod-
els for evaluating the safety and efficacy of therapeutics
and vaccines directly against HIV requires the incorpo-
ration of human lymphoid tissues and/or hematopoietic
lineage cells. Such mouse models exist, and are termed, 
human immune system (HIS)-humanized mice [3, 4]. To
construct HIS-humanized mice, immunodeficient mice
are myoablated to eradicate residual mouse bone marrow
stem cells, and then engrafted with human peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or human hemat-
opoietic stem cells (HSC) with or without transplanta-
tion of lymphoid tissues, such as thymus and/or spleen
[5]. Over a period of a few weeks to months, transplanted
mice develop human immune cells, and reconstitution is
confirmed by flow cytometry [5] (Fig. 1). HIS-humanized
mice can then be employed in studies investigating HIV
prevention or cure strategies [5]. In this review, we will
discuss the myriad of approaches for developing HIS-
humanized mouse models, and their applications in HIV
therapeutics and vaccine development studies, along with
their limitations. Finally, we will discuss the potential 
of an emerging HIS-humanized rat model, which has a
longer lifespan and greater physiological similarity to
humans compared to mice, designed to enable longitudi-
nal studies in evaluating therapeutics against HIV reser-
voirs and vaccine-induced immunity [6, 7].
Humanized mice that incorporate human immune
cells
Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL)‑humanized mouse
model
Human ­CD4+ T cells are the major target for HIV infec-
tion; thus, a mouse model with human C­ D4+ T cells
provides a platform for modeling HIV/AIDS. Vari-
ous immunodeficient mouse models lacking mature T, 
B, [8] and NK cells, along with defects in macrophage
phagocytic function [9] support robust reconstitu-
tion of human CD4+ T cells and other lymphocytes
(e.g. CD8 + T cells) following transplantation of human
PBMCs or CD4+ T cells. Such cells can be transplanted
via intravenous (IV) or intraperitoneal (IP) injection into
myoablated, immunodeficient juvenile mice (6–8 weeks
old) at a dose of 5–10 × 10^6 cell per mouse, to gener-
ate peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL)-humanized mice. 
Human CD4 + T cells are readily detectable in the blood
Fig. 1  Construction of the human Immune System-humanized mouse models. (I) Immunodeficient mice are myoablated via irradiation or
busulfan, followed by the administration of antibiotics and analgesics. General anesthesia is induced prior to surgery. (II) To generate human
lymphoid tissue xenografts along with autologous immune cell reconstitution, human fetal lymphoid tissue(s) and liver are processed into 1 mm2
pieces, and autologous CD34 + HSCs are isolated from the fetal liver via immunomagnetic selection. CD34 + HSCs are then transplanted via
retro-orbital injection following renal capsule transplantation of the lymphoid tissues. Alternatively, to generate human immune cell only, PBMCs, 
CD4+ T cells, or CD34 + HSCs are transplanted via IV or IP injection. (III) Transplanted mice are maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions
and the human lymphoid tissue(s), and/or immune cell reconstitution in the peripheral blood and murine lymphoid tissues (humanized-murine
tissues) are allowed to develop over a period of 2–10 weeks (or more), resulting in the HIS-humanized mouse model

at 4 weeks post-transplantation [9, 10], hence providing a
humanized mouse model that can be generated in a rela-
tively short period. The PBL-humanized mouse model
supports HIV replication and provides a means of evalu-
ating the efficacy of direct-acting therapeutics (e.g. anti-
virals drugs, antibodies) geared towards preventing HIV
transmission [11] and controlling HIV replication [9].
Additionally, PBL-humanized mouse models constructed
using PBMCs from HIV-infected individuals with unde-
tectable viral load can be employed as an in vivo assay
(mouse-quantitative viral outgrowth assay) for evaluat-
ing the eradication of the HIV reservoir in said individu-
als [12, 13]. A major limitation of this model is the rapid
development of graft-versus-host (GvHD) disease within
6–7 weeks following transplantation of lymphocytes, 
thus significantly restricting the experimental window
[14].  Additionally, the PBL-humanized mouse model
does not incorporate human macrophages, which are
a major HIV reservoir in various organs, including the
brain [9, 15]. However, modification of the PBL-human-
ized mouse model via transplantation of HIV-infected
monocyte-derived macrophages in the brain supports
HIV infection and pathogenesis in the brain [15].
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC)‑humanized mouse model
In order to generate a de novo human immune system
and reconstitute a broader spectrum of human immune
cells in HIS-humanized mice, myoablated, immunode-
ficient mice are transplanted with human CD34 + HSCs
via intrahepatic or intracardiac injection in neona-
tal mice [10, 16] or IV injection in juvenile/adult mice
[16, 17]. These HSCs can be obtained from a myriad of
sources, including fetal liver tissue [17, 18] and neona-
tal cord blood cells [4, 16, 19]. Human immune recon-
stitution in the HSC-humanized mouse model requires
10–12 weeks to develop [20].  Various hematopoietic
lineages, including T cells, monocytes/macrophages, B
cells and dendritic cells are developed in the blood and
other tissues (e.g., spleen, liver, brain) [20]. Moreover, the
HSC-humanized mouse model generates a naïve human
immune system, which negates confounding factors
associated with prior pathogen exposure [16, 21].  The
HSC-humanized mouse model supports HIV infection, 
CD4+ T cell depletion, chronic immune activation and
limited anti-HIV T and B cell immune responses [4]. A
major advantage of the HSC-humanized mouse model
over the PBL-humanized mouse model is the delayed and
reduced incidence of GvHD, which provides the oppor-
tunity for long-term modeling of HIV infection and rep-
lication [9]. The HSC-humanized mouse model provides
a means of evaluating the efficacy and safety of direct-
acting therapeutics (e.g. antivirals drugs, antibodies) 
and immune-modulatory agents (e.g. pDC modulators 
[22]) geared towards preventing HIV transmission, con-
trolling HIV replication, and ameliorating CD4+ T cell
depletion and chronic immune activation [4]. The HSC-
humanized mouse model supports HIV transmission
via the IV (along with IP) route [18]; however, conflict-
ing reports exist for the mucosal route of transmission
[23, 24]. Additionally, the reconstituted human T cells
are educated in the mouse thymic epithelium, thus limit-
ing antigen-specific responses [25]. This limitation of T
cell education in the murine thymic epithelium has been
partially overcome by the construction human leukocyte
antigen (HLA) class I transgenic-immunodeficient mice
to support robust T cell development of HLA-matched
HSC transplants [26]. Moreover, lymph nodes and spleen
are poorly reconstituted, including a limited develop-
ment of human B and myeloid cells in the white and
red pulps of the spleen [27]. Several modifications have
been made to the HSC model to address these limita-
tions. Li et al. constructed an immunodeficient mouse
model that incorporated a lymphoid tissue-stromal
cytokine transgene (i.e. thymic-stromal-cell-derived lym-
phopoietin) and demonstrated improved lymph node
development in HSC-humanized mice [27].  Addition-
ally, studies have demonstrated enhanced human B and
myeloid cell development in murine secondary lymphoid
tissues via transgenic expression of critical cytokines
(i.e. IL6; IL3, GM-CSF and SCF) for B and myeloid cell
maturation [28–30].  Although incorporation of requi-
site human transgenes in HIS-humanized mice has been
successful in demonstrating improved development of
immune cells, often the resultant lineage is skewed, as
the transgene expression is not synchronized for physio-
logical expression and supporting stromal cells and other
essential cytokines are absent [28–30].
Humanized mice that incorporate human immune
cells and lymphoid tissues
Bone marrow–liver–thymus (BLT)‑humanized mouse
model
Another strategy for improving human immune cell
development in HIS-humanized mouse models is to
implant human lymphoid tissues containing the requi-
site microenvironment for supporting robust immune
cell development. To facilitate human T cell educa-
tion and associated function, human thymic tissues are
incorporated in HIS-humanized mice, and termed, Bone
marrow–liver–thymus (BLT)-humanized mice [31, 32] 
(Fig. 2). BLT-humanized mice have served as a key ani-
mal model for HIV research for over a decade and are a
cost-effective alternative to the surrogate, simian immu-
nodeficiency virus (SIV)-non-human primate (NHP) 
models. The BLT-humanized mouse model is generated
by surgically transplanting myoablated, immunodeficient

Fig. 2  Current and emerging HIS-humanized animal models. To
construct HIS-humanized mice and rats, immunodeficient mice
and rats are myoablated, followed by engraftment of human
lymphoid tissues (thymus with or without human spleen) under
the kidney capsule, along with injection of autologous human
CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. In representative images, we
show the engrafted human lymphoid tissues (human thymus
xenograft-thymus, white tissue; human spleen xenograft-Spleen, 
dark brown tissue and the reconstituted rodent-spleen (humanized
spleen-hSpleen). Note: mouse and rat organs are not at the same
scale
mice with fetal human liver and thymus tissues, followed
by IV injection of autologous C­ D34+ HSCs [31, 33, 34].
Transplanted mice require 10–12 weeks for systemic
reconstitution of human cells post-transplantation [31, 
33, 34].  The most widely utilized strain for construct-
ing BLT mice is the NOD-Prkdcscid IL2rgTm1Wjl (NSG) 
[21, 32], which is readily available from Jackson Labo-
ratory. BLT-humanized mice can also be constructed
using comparable immunodeficient mouse strains, such
as, C57BL/6 Rag2−/−γc−/−CD47−/− (TKO) [21, 35].
The key benefit of the BLT-humanized mouse model over
PBL- and HSC-humanized mouse models is the pres-
ence of human thymic microenvironment, which facili-
tates T cell education in an autologous human tissue that
contains the requisite stromal cells (as well as cytokines
and factors, presumably at physiological levels) [21].
BLT-humanized mice have systemic tissue reconstitution
with human immune cells, including in mucosal tissues, 
which enables mucosal transmission [36–43] and reca-
pitulates the main route of HIV transmission in humans
[36–44]. Other hallmarks of HIV infection and replica-
tion in BLT-humanized mice include robust T cell deple-
tion [36, 42], central nervous system infiltration [45, 46], 
immune response [35, 47–50], and latency [51–53]. The
BLT-humanized mouse model is a robust platform for
evaluating HIV prevention and cure strategies, including
antiretroviral therapy, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP),
latency reversing agents (LRA),  vaccination, proviral
excision, and T cell engineering (Table 1).
Despite significant advances gained from the BLT-
humanized mouse model, the system does have some
disadvantages. Construction of BLT-humanized mice
requires advanced surgical expertise and extensive expe-
rience; therefore, these animals are constructed pre-
dominantly by specialized core facilities. Additionally, 
BLT-humanized mice are prone to GvHD, which limits
the experimental window these animals can be utilized to
approximately 6 months post-engraftment [54, 55]. How-
ever, BLT-humanized mice constructed with a C57BL/6
immunodeficient background are resistant to GvHD [35, 
53].  Another disadvantage involves the use of human
fetal tissues in constructing the model; these tissues are
not readily available. Furthermore, a typical human fetal
thymus and autologous fetal liver-derived HSCs can only
support the construction of 15–25 BLT-humanized mice. 
The limited availability of said human fetal tissues creates
logistical and operational constraints. Recently, a novel
BLT-like humanized mouse model has been developed
using non-autologous human cord blood-derived HSCs
and human neonatal/pediatric thymus, which enable
investigators to construct > 1000 BLT-like humanized
mice using cryopreserved thymus tissues and readily
available cord blood-derived HSCs [96]. Recent studies
demonstrate that these BLT-like humanized mice develop
human immune cells, support HIV infection and replica-
tion, and exhibit anti-HIV immune response (unpub-
lished data from Elie Haddad, Chloé Colas, et al., at the
CanCure 5th Annual General Meeting—2019, Poster Ses-
sion, in Montreal, Canada).  Despite systemic immune
cell reconstitution and HIV-specific immune responses, 
both neonatal/pediatric tissue- and fetal tissue-derived
BLT-humanized mouse models BLT mice do not develop
a complete human immune system. The current widely
used immunodeficient mouse models possess an IL-2
receptor γ chain deletion [97–100]. As a result, mouse
lymphoid organs do not fully develop in such models, 
[21] and the loss of lymphoid tissue microenvironment
impairs the ability of BLT-humanized mice to develop a
robust humoral immune response, as immunoglobulins
are skewed towards IgM or weak IgG response [35, 49, 
99, 101–103]. Constructing BLT-humanized mice using
immunodeficient mouse models with requisite human
transgenic factors/cytokines, may optimize human B cell
development and overcome the limitations of humoral
immune response in the model [28, 104, 105]. An alter-
native strategy, which is consistent with the BLT-model

strategy, is to incorporate the requisite human second-
ary lymphoid tissue (i.e. spleen) microenvironment for
robust human immune cell (e.g. B cells, macrophages) 
development and response [5].
Bone marrow–liver–thymus–spleen (BLTS)‑humanized
mouse model
To address the limitations of the BLT-humanized mouse
model, namely, poor development of secondary lymphoid
tissue and modest macrophage reconstitution, we incor-
porated human spleen into the BLT-humanized mouse
model, and termed these animals, Bone marrow–liver–
thymus–spleen (BLTS)-humanized mice [5] (Fig. 2).
BLTS-humanized mice exhibit significant improvement
over the BLT-humanized mice by addressing several limi-
tations [5]. Successful spleen growth dramatically low-
ers the incidence of GvHD in BLTS-humanized mice, 
thus allowing for experimental studies that extend up to
9 months post-transplantation [5]. We speculate that the
decreased GvHD in BLTS-humanized mice results from
appropriate modulation of T cell activation by the human
antigen-presenting cells in the human spleen xenograft. 
The human spleen in the BLTS-humanized mouse model
recapitulates human adult spleen architecture and facili-
tates better reconstitution of immune cells, including
human red pulp macrophages, which are poorly recon-
stituted in the BLT-humanized mouse model [5]. It is well
established that macrophages can serve as a reservoir for
HIV [106–108]; thus, the BLTS-humanized mouse model
provides a system for investigating human splenic mac-
rophage-HIV interactions [5].  Additionally, the spleen
is a major lymphoid tissue reservoir, with B cell follicles
in the white-pulp serving as an immune privilege site
for anti-HIV T-cells [109]. The human spleen in BLTS-
humanized mice provides a model for investigating anti-
HIV immune response within the white-pulp and the
role of B cell follicle in mediating HIV persistence. The
BLTS-humanized mouse model supports cART-medi-
ated HIV load suppression, and replication competent
HIV reservoirs can be detected in human spleen tissues
[5]. Lymphoid tissue fibrosis is an immuno-pathogenic
feature associated with HIV infection and plays a major
role in mediating chronic inflammation and abrogating
the development of a robust immune response [110]. A
major advantage of the BLTS-humanized mouse model
is that HIV infection results in lymphoid tissue fibro-
sis; this disease manifestation is absent in HIV-infected
BLT-humanized mice [5]. Although the BLTS-humanized
mouse model exhibits more robust immune reconstitu-
tion compared to its BLT counterpart, the two models
share some limitations. The transplantation of the human
tissues under the renal capsule requires an individual
with advanced surgical skills. The BLTS-humanized 
mouse model uses human fetal tissues, which introduces
logistical and operational constraints. The use of frozen
fetal tissues and HSCs can alleviate some of those con-
straints (unpublished data). Demonstrating robust anti-
HIV immunity in HIS-humanized mouse models has
been a long-term goal in the field because said system
would allow robust evaluation of HIV vaccine candidates
against circulating viral strains. The incorporation of
human primary and secondary lymphoid tissues in HIS-
humanized mice brings us closer to this goal. At present, 
we are actively investigating the anti-HIV human immu-
nity in the BLTS-humanized mouse model to deter-
mine if this system provides a means for evaluating HIV
vaccines.
Emerging human immune system (HIS)‑humanized
rat model
Prior to the development of genetic engineering tech-
nologies for creating transgenic and knockout mice, rats
were the predominant specie of rodents employed in bio-
medical research [6]. Advantages of using rats include
their longer lifespans (~ 3.5 years) and larger size (~ 350
grams),  which facilitates longer experimental window
and larger sampling volumes compared to the short lifes-
pan (< 1 year) and small size (< 25 g) of mice [6]. Rats
provide a more ideal platform for in vivo imaging of dis-
eases, as the larger size of rats provides better resolution
[111]. Additionally, rat models exhibit advanced cogni-
tive skills and critical physiological parameters (e.g. heart
rate, drug metabolism) that more closely mimic humans
[112–115]. Recent advances in genetic engineering, such
as the CRISPR/Cas 9 technology has enabled the devel-
opment of several immunodeficient rat models for trans-
planting and regenerating human tissues and cells [7, 
116–118].  Similar to currently used immunodeficient
mouse models, immunodeficient rat models carry muta-
tions in Rag1/2 and IL2rγ genes, with or without SIRP1α
transgene [7, 116–118]. A recent study demonstrated that
these immunodeficient rats can be reconstituted with a
myriad of human immune cells following transplantation
with human-fetal liver-derived HSCs and autologous thy-
mus tissues [7] (Fig. 2). These HIS-humanized rat models
could provide a means for robust longitudinal studies on
the safety and efficacy of therapeutic agents targeting the
HIV reservoir. Additionally, HIS-humanized rats could
provide a means for modeling HIV-associated end organ
diseases, such as cardiovascular, neurocognitive and lung
diseases.
Conclusions
Despite successful prevention of HIV transmission with
antiviral drugs, it is likely that an effective vaccine pro-
vides the only means of ending the HIV epidemic [2].

Over the past decades, several promising vaccine candi-
dates have failed in large-scale safety and efficacy clini-
cal trials [2]. The failure of those clinical trials suggests
that improved “gate keeper” animal modeling systems are
needed for better prediction of vaccine candidate out-
comes in human clinical trials [119]. Currently, the sur-
rogate SIV-NHP model is the sole “gate keeper” animal
model for determining potential of vaccine candidates
[119]. Candidate HIV vaccines selected using this gate-
keeper system have been unsuccessful in human clinical
trials [119]; suggesting, major improvements in animal
modeling are needed. Although significant advancements
are still needed in improving HIS-humanized models, 
several recent advances, such as improved human-sec-
ondary lymphoid tissue development, along with the
previously developed, robust primary lymphoid tissue
development has made it possible to evaluate human
immune responses to vaccines [5, 27].  Ideally, these
“improved” HIS-humanized mouse models will comple-
ment NHP models in addressing critical gaps, such as
vaccine-induced immune responses against circulating
HIV strains, vaccine safety in the context of HIV trans-
mission, and human-correlates of immunity. Although
cART has significantly reduced the morbidity and mor-
tality associated with chronic HIV infection, the HIV
reservoir persists in people living with HIV (PLHIV) 
and is associated with chronic inflammation, lymphoid
tissue damage, and a myriad of end-organ diseases [1].
Therefore, eradicating the HIV reservoir and associated
chronic inflammation and end organ diseases remains a
major challenge. The mechanisms of HIV persistence in
PLHIV, despite robust cART-mediated suppression of
the virus, are thought to be multifactorial. These factors
include persistence in transcriptionally quiescent rest-
ing memory CD4+ T cells in the peripheral blood and
lymphoid tissues, infection of long-lived resident tissue
macrophages in lymphoid tissues and immune privilege
organs (e.g. brain, testes, B cell follicle, etc.), and dysregu-
lation in anti-HIV immunity. By virtue of the multitude of
factors that play a role in HIV persistence, in vivo models
that recapitulate human host-HIV interactions are nec-
essary for determining the safety and efficacy of thera-
peutic agents for eradicating HIV reservoirs. Improved
HIS-humanized mouse models with systemic reconstitu-
tion of human immune cells and robust lymphoid tissues
development provide a means of evaluating both direct-
acting and immune-modulatory HIV-cure therapeutics. 
Further advances in improving the human-immune sys-
tem in HIS-humanized mouse and rat models will pro-
vide better in vivo systems for evaluating the safety and
efficacy of therapeutics and vaccines for HIV prevention
and cure.
