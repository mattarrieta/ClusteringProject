Universal health coverage and COVID‑19: 
recent developments and implications
Rabia Hussain1,2* and Sara Arif3
Abstract 
Universal health coverage (UHC) is meant to access the key health services including disease prevention, treatment, 
rehabilitation, and health promotion. UHC varies according to demographics, epidemiology, and technology-based
trends, as well as according to people’s expectations. Globally, the transition towards UHC has been associated with
the intent of improving accessibility and affordability of healthcare. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the health
systems of even the most developed economies of the world in an unprecedented manner. The situation is also very
challenging for the countries with the existing health inequities as well as the countries with the developing health-
care systems. This has amplified the need to accelerate efforts to build strong and resilient health systems to achieve
progress towards UHC. This commentary discusses a global overview of UHC in the wake of COVID19. It also high-
lights the initiatives taken by Pakistan to promote the goals of UHC.

Background
Universal health coverage (UHC) is defined by the World
Health Organization as ensuring access to key health
services including disease prevention, treatment, reha-
bilitation, and health promotion. Thus, promoting equity, 
efficiency effectiveness and affordability of healthcare
services to the beneficiaries. UHC varies according to
the demographics, epidemiology, and technology-based
trends, as well as people’s expectations [1, 2]. It holds an
equal importance in providing quality health services
while ensuring equity and access together with financial
management. Broader coverage of good quality health
services results in improving the health indicators of the
population, reduces health inequalities, and promotes
stronger economic development. It also focuses on build-
ing resilient healthcare systems with the ability to address
complex challenges through prevention, detection, timely
response, maintenance of peace as well as to protect the
economy [3].

Global overview of universal health coverage
adoption
Globally, the transition towards UHC has been asso-
ciated with the intent of improving accessibility and
affordability of healthcare, but UHC initiatives are often
adopted in response to a social, economic, or political
revamp. For example, Japan began its movement towards
UHC before World War II to develop a healthy workforce
through Citizens Health Insurance. France has provided
UHC to all of its residents in 1999 by the establishment
of the Universal Health Coverage Act (CMU), and it is
the highest financial protection provider for healthcare
related expenses among countries in the Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) [4].
In some countries, UHC was adopted to counter finan-
cial crisis, such as Turkey, Indonesia, and Thailand. To
overcome health inequalities and financial risk, Turkey
has introduced UHC through the Health Transforma-
tion Programme in 2003 [4]. Similarly, Thailand adopted
UHC in 2002, which provided health coverage to all
66.3 million Thai citizens; however, UHC in Indonesia
was planned to be fully implement in 2019 through the
National Health Insurance (NHI) enrolling about 198

million Indonesians in the programme. Similarly, after
the establishment of the Unified Health System in 1988, 
more than 75% of the Brazilian nationals are now get-
ting benefit from this programme. Likewise, South Africa
is also progressing towards the implementation of UHC
through the development of a National Health Insurance
(NHI) programme [4, 5].
By the mid of twentieth century, high-income coun-
tries, such as New Zealand, Australia and Canada has
implemented the UHC in various formats. For example, 
Australia and Canada have adopted UHC through the
involvement of federal government and regionally admin-
istered systems in states. In 1938, after the implementa-
tion of Social Security Act, New Zealand had a consensus
that the government will have a fundamental role in pro-
viding for the population’s healthcare needs [6].
COVID‑19 and universal health coverage
Amid COVID-19, the delivery of essential healthcare ser-
vices is interrupted and inaccessible in almost all parts
of the world. Even high-income countries have strug-
gled hard to provide adequate healthcare, medical com-
modities, diagnostic testing, and specialized Intensive
Care Unit (ICU) equipments during the pandemic. The
situation is far more challenging for the countries with
existing health inequities and developing healthcare sys-
tems. The pandemic has emphasized the importance of
universal access to healthcare, proving that if the health-
care needs of a segment of the population are unattended
or even a single individual is left unaddressed, the whole
population is at risk [3].
Given the gross inequality in health status between
male and female, rich and poor, developed and devel-
oping countries, it is estimated that about 150 mil-
lion individuals worldwide face catastrophic healthcare
expenditures and out of these more than 100 million are
living in the poverty [7]. Thus, unlike any other crisis in
the recent history, COVID-19 has amplified the urgency
to accelerate efforts to build strong and resilient health
systems and to achieve progress towards UHC. Strong
health systems with adequate resources are key to a suc-
cessful crisis response and management. It has been
demonstrated that the countries with a strong UHC, such
as South Korea and Singapore, have outperformed during
COVID-19 pandemic. In Japan, a COVID-19 response is
coupled with effective public financing policies and uni-
versal health insurance with uniform fee schedule. These
policies have been effective in tackling COVID-19 and
have provided an efficient mitigation response along with
the restoration of essential health services amid pan-
demic [8]. 
The emerging story of universal health coverage
from Pakistan
Healthcare in Pakistan is facing enormous challenges
involving a high burden of communicable and non-com-
municable diseases. Pakistan has highest prevalence of
conditions including tuberculosis, maternal health issues, 
nutritional deficiencies, polio, malaria, and other com-
municable diseases in high-risk population groups [9–
11]. Healthcare standards for access and quality lag far
behind as compared to neighboring South Asian coun-
tries with Pakistan being ranked at 154th position among
195 countries worldwide. However, with an increase in
Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) index from 26.8 to
37.6, access to healthcare has improved since the 1990s
[12]. Despite the gains, geographical disparities still exist
in the coverage of different healthcare services between
provinces as well as between rural and urban areas [13].
Lower per capita spending on health, poor infrastructure, 
undue pressure and inadequate facilities at the public
healthcare sector, lack of essential medicines and sup-
plies, shortage of trained and skilled healthcare person-
nel, and high bed to patient ratios are some challenges
that have worsened during pandemic. In nutshell, the
COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the need to intensify
efforts to improve UHC in Pakistan [3].
Pakistan is attempting to make progress in universal
healthcare access with special attention being paid to
vulnerable population groups. The Pakistan’s National
Health Vision 2016–2025 has recognized the UHC as
a top priority and several national programs and poli-
cies are aligned to it [10]. In this regard, several pro-
poor initiatives have been taken by the government of
Pakistan. “Sehat Sahulat Program”, which is a govern-
ment-run health protection initiative, was started in
2016, providing financial coverage and accessibility to
the households below the poverty line through micro
health insurance scheme. There are now over seven
million families currently enrolled in the programme, 
availing to the access of good quality medical care
worth about 720,000 Pakistani rupees (PKR) (about
4600 USD) per family per year from both the public
and private specialty based tertiary care and specialty
hospitals. Similarly, on August 21, 2020. Khyber Pakh-
tunkhwa, a province in Pakistan, has launched a UHC
programme for all its 40 million residents, as a response
to COVID-19. This is a six-phased programme and
it has completed on January 31, 2021, as being the first
UHC programme in Pakistan to cover 100% of the pop-
ulation. It provides PKR200,000 (USD1200) for a range
of services including—emergency and maternity care, 
orthopedic and general surgery; cardiac, neurological
and kidney diseases, diabetes, breast cancer screen-
ing and artificial limbs (prosthesis), cancer treatment,

kidney transplant, and ICU care [14]. These models are
constructed in alignment with Pakistan’s commitment
to achieve UHC by 2030. Insurance schemes under
UHC can play a critical role by incorporating quality
assurance into organizational procurement practices
for a better access to healthcare [15]. The most signifi-
cant initiative for Pakistan has been the development
of National Package of Essential Health Services over
the past 2 years based on Disease Control Priorities 3rd
edition.
With this, Pakistan has become the first country to
develop an evidence-based UHC services package that
is focused on the equitable provision of essential health-
care services to each and every segment of the popula-
tion through five service delivery platforms, i.e.,  the
community level, primary healthcare, first level hospitals, 
tertiary hospitals and at population level. This package
encompasses the sets of priority health interventions and
intersectoral policies that are based on the localized evi-
dence of burden of disease, feasibility, cost effectiveness, 
financial risk protection, equity, and other social indica-
tors in Pakistan. Successful implementation of EPHS
package through active involvement of all the stakehold-
ers will gauge the progress towards achievement of UHC
milestones within the available resources [16].
In Pakistan context, strengthening health and phar-
macy systems and using generic medicines as cost-effec-
tive options can also help improve medicines use and can
also help achieve the aims of UHC [17–19].
Conclusions
UHC is meant to provide access to healthcare services to
all parts of the population, regardless of geography, epi-
demiology and technology. In the past, many countries
adopted UHC, particularly during economically difficult
circumstances, so is the situation with the developing
countries such as Pakistan during COVID-19. Although
it will not be easy to fully achieve UHC in Pakistan, 
the government and respective partners need to work
together to fully implement UHC in all the parts of the
country.
