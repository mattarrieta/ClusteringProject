Abstract 
Background:  Adequate quality systems throughout pharmaceutical supply chains are crucial to protect individuals
and communities from substandard and falsified medical products. Thus, pharmaceutical distributors are regularly
assessed by qualified experts. Since the COVID-19 pandemic has forced a suspension of normal activities, remote
assessments via videoconferencing may represent a temporary alternative to on-site audits. We exploratorily evalu-
ated the feasibility of remote assessments of pharmaceutical distributors, located in a low- or middle-income country
hard-to reach during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Methods:  We conducted pilot remote assessments of four conveniently selected distributors. The expert was
remotely connected via videoconference, and supported by an in-country assessment facilitator (ICAF), who had
received ad hoc training and was present at the assessed facility. First, the remote expert assessed the quality assur-
ance (QA) activities and rated their compliance with the standards of the World Health Organization Good Storage &
Distribution Practices (GSDP), as per routine practice. Second, s/he assessed the completeness, clarity and accuracy of
data collected remotely, first per distributor, and then in aggregated form.
Results:  Data completeness was assessed by the expert as excellent, while clarity and accuracy were good. Overall
data quality (a combination of completeness, clarity and accuracy) was good, with no major differences across QA
activities, nor across distributors. Contextual limitations included poor internet connection, language barriers, and
distributors’ lack of familiarity with QA terminology.
Conclusions:  Our findings are exploratory and cannot be extrapolated to other contexts, nor to other types of audits. 
Nonetheless, this pilot experience suggests that a well-planned remote assessment of pharmaceutical distributors, 
conducted with the support of a well-trained onsite ICAF, can provide data of acceptable quality, allowing to assess
GSDP-compliance and to make temporary decisions about licensing or purchasing. Purchasers and policy makers
should read the results of remote assessments in light of their intrinsic limitations. At the moment, onsite assessments
remain the gold standards, but this could change in the longer term, with improved information technology and in
light of the need to avoid unnecessary travels. Furthermore, remote assessments could be considered for routine pre-
screening candidates for on-site assessments, and for targeted follow-up of on-site assessment.

Background
The Sustainable Development Goal 3.8 aims at universal
health coverage (UHC), including quality and affordable
essential medicines and vaccines for all. There is increas-
ing evidence that adequate regulatory oversight and
medicines quality assurance mechanisms throughout the
supply chain are crucial to protect individuals and com-
munities from substandard and falsified medical prod-
ucts, and that they are strictly interconnected with the
goals of UHC [1]. Unfortunately, the quality systems of
pharmaceutical distributors in low-income and middle-
income countries (LMICs) tend to be weak [2], and insuf-
ficient to prevent and detect the supply of poor-quality
medicines [3]. Furthermore, the weaknesses of National
Regulatory Authorities (NRA) hinder the implementa-
tion of stringent regulatory supervisions along the sup-
ply chain in many LMICs. To correct this situation, the
World Health Organization (WHO) started a Global
Benchmarking of Regulatory Systems for evaluating
the national regulatory systems through a comprehen-
sive and systematic benchmarking [4, 5]. While achiev-
ing stringency of all NRAs remain the ultimate goal of
stakeholders in pharmaceutical systems, short- and mid-
dle-term strategies are needed to secure the quality of
medicines and other health products procured in poorly
regulated contexts [6].
Twenty-six non-for-profit purchasers of medicines and
other health products are currently members of QUA-
MED. QUAMED stands for ‘’Quality Medicine for All’’. It
is a humanitarian alliance that aims to improve access to
quality medicines, by raising awareness among key play-
ers in pharmaceutical supply systems, and by reinforcing
the quality assurance and supply policies of its members
[7].  Among its activities, QUAMED conducts assess-
ments of pharmaceutical suppliers, and it advices its own
members for the selection of reliable local suppliers. The
assessments are conducted according to the standards
of the WHO Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) [8],
for manufacturers of finished pharmaceutical products, 
of the WHO Model Quality Assurance System (MQAS) 
[9], for procurement agencies/distributors that prequalify
their own sources and suppliers, and of the WHO Good
Storage & Distribution Practices (GSDP) [10], for “tech-
nical visits” of distributors that do not prequalify their
own sources and suppliers.
Pharmaceutical assessments traditionally require the
on-site presence of a qualified expert, who carries out
first-hand observations of policies, procedures, records 
and practices at the assessed facilities. Unfortunately, the
COVID-19 pandemic has forced a partial suspension of
normal activities, due to the restrictions on international
travels. Under these circumstances, remote assessments
could represent a temporary alternative to the on-site
assessments. To the best of our knowledge, there are no
explicit restrictions in the WHO and regulatory guidance
to conduct remote audits or inspections, but there is no
detailed guidance either. For the European Medicines
Agency (EMA), a distant assessment is an “assessment of
the compliance of a site (…) on the basis of documents
and interviews and supported by technology for commu-
nicating, accessing systems, sharing and reviewing docu-
ments and other information, without the inspectors
being physically present at the sites, where the activities
subject to the assessment have taken place and where the
inspection would ordinarily be hosted” [11]. According
to EMA, “on-site inspections should be conducted when
circumstances permit following the distant assessment”,
and inspectors should make “a case-by-case decision on
whether a distant assessment is considered appropri-
ate and feasible. The criticality of the product should be
taken into consideration”. Furthermore, the optimal com-
munication platform could include a live videoconference
platform with break-out rooms/conferences and screen
sharing, smart glasses or other mobile cameras which
can be interfaced to the videoconference platform, and
access to a secure cloud server to share documents.”[11].
EMA also published a “Guidance on remote Good Clini-
cal Practices inspections during the COVID-19 pan-
demic” [12], and the EU Medical Device Coordination
Group published a detailed “Guidance on temporary
extraordinary measures related to medical device Noti-
fied Body audits during COVID-19 quarantine orders
and travel restrictions” [13]. For the United States Food
and Drug Administration (US-FDA), a remote audit is an
“audit performed off-site through the use of information
and communication technology” (synonyms are eAudit, 
and virtual audit)[14]. At the beginning of the COVID-
19 pandemic, the US-FDA postponed on-site GMP and
GSDP inspections, before adjusting their strategy based
on the risks [15].  The US-FDA’s Medical Device and
Single Audit Program started a Remote Auditing pilot
program, to gauge the viability of remote Device Mar-
keting Authorization and Facility Registration Process
[16], but to the best of our knowledge, no guidance has
been issued for remote pharmaceutical inspections. Con-
versely, a few stakeholders in the private sector developed
Page 3
Bourasseau   et al. J of Pharm Policy and Pract (2021) 14:43  Page 3 of 9
some guidance. For instance, Mark Durivage, from Qual-
ity Systems Compliance LLC, illustrated the pros and
cons of remote GMP audits versus on-site audits [17],
while Freyr Solutions linked remote “desktop” audits to
the levels of risk in a self-speaking infographic [18].
Overall, even if video conferencing is today accepted
practice in several sectors, there is little public infor-
mation on the use of Information Technology (IT) and
video-conferencing tools for the remote assessment of
pharmaceutical facilities. In addition, scientific literature
provides little or no guidance on whether this would be
feasible. There is an urgent need to address this question, 
and to understand which factors could have an impact on
the feasibility of remote pharmaceutical assessments, e.g.,
the nature of the audit, the characteristics of the audited
facility, the quality of the in-country Internet connection, 
etc.
Therefore, this operational research was conducted to
evaluate the feasibility of remote GSDP technical visits of
pharmaceutical distributors located in an LMIC hard-to
reach during the COVID-19 pandemic. Secondary objec-
tives included describing the challenges, benefits and
intrinsic limitations of the remote GSDP technical visits, 
adapting the QUAMED “on-site” GSDP procedure to the
“remote” modality, and formulating recommendations
on eligibility criteria, procedures, and tools for remote
GSDP technical visits.
Methods
Study design, procedures and setting
We conducted four pilot remote technical visits of phar-
maceutical distributors, and assessed their feasibility. An
overview of the study methodology is provided in Fig. 1.
Development or adaptation of standard operating
procedures (SOP)
We developed the SOP for the remote GSDP assessment. 
It is based on a previous SOP for on-site GSDP visit, 
which uses a standardized questionnaire, and a rating
system that individually assesses twelve quality assurance
activities [2]. The new SOP covers the respective roles
and responsibilities of the remote expert and of the in-
country assessment facilitator (ICAF),  including confi-
dentiality and conflict of interest, the practical setup for
the remote technical assessment, including what should
happen before it (e.g.,  sending upfront selected docu-
ments, including licenses, organigrams, list of supplied
products, etc.), during it (e.g., interviews with key staff, 
visit of the premises, essential functions to be filmed
or photographed etc.),  and after it (i.e.,  the reporting
aspects).  Importantly, the SOP includes aspects spe-
cific to the remote methodology, such as the selection, 
minimum competencies and training of the in-country 
assessment facilitator (ICAF). The ICAF, who should be
free from any conflict of interest, should be present at the
assessed distributor for ensuring the link with the remote
expert throughout the remote assessment, e.g., by posi-
tioning the video camera as required by the expert, doing
translations, double checking on site documents etc.. We
also adapted the SOP to address the use of digital tech-
nology (video and audio recording, pictures of premises, 
documents etc.) and the management of information
obtained remotely, in compliance with the European
Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016.
Selection of country and distributors
The essential requirements for selecting the study coun-
try were the possibility to use IT communication, and
the availability of support from QUAMED member
organization(s) (from now onward called “QUAMED
member”) working in-country, e.g.,  for selecting and
contacting the distributors, appointing an ICAF etc. 
Countries where English or French are usually accepted
working languages were preferred. Furthermore, in-
country local distributors were eligible if indicated by a
QUAMED member in the country as potential suppliers
of medicines and health products.
A call for interest was sent to all QUAMED members
in July 2020. The process resulted in the selection of an
LMIC hard to reach during the pandemic, where two
QUAMED members interested in this work were present, 
and of four pharmaceutical distributors within it. The
four distributors accepted the QUAMED remote assess-
ments. To keep the promise of confidentiality made to
them, neither the country nor the distributors are made
identifiable in the study report and in this manuscript.
Selection of ICAFs
To be eligible as ICAF, local staff of QUAMED members
operating in the study country needed to be fluent in
English or French (depending on the country), to under-
stand local languages (as applicable),  and not to have
any professional or other links to the assessed distribu-
tors. Importantly, they needed to have proven experience
in medical supply chain management. Candidates with
formal training in pharmacy or logistics, and/or previ-
ous knowledge of WHO GSDP were preferred. Potential
ICAFs were identified by the QUAMED member(s) oper-
ating in the study country, and applications were assessed
by the expert. Two experienced ICAFs were selected, a
pharmacist, and a logistics manager trained in business
administration, and remotely briefed by the expert. Each
ICAF supported two out of four remote audits.
The remote assessment matrix is presented in Table 1.

Data collection and analysis
The remote GSDP technical visits were conducted by the
expert between 2nd and 23rd November 2020, with the
expert remotely connected and one ICAF physically pre-
sent onsite. Twelve standard QA activities were assessed
by the expert, according to the usual procedure applicable
for on-site visits, while the ICAF facilitated the expert’s
visual access to the relevant spaces, processes and func-
tions. Four out of 12 QA activities (i.e., assessment of the
QA system, documentation system, human resources, 
and quality control) are mainly based on a desk assess-
ment of the documentation provided by the distributor
(i.e., office work), while the eight remaining can only be
assessed by visiting (seeing) the premises (i.e.,  remote
warehouse assessment).  The expert rated each activity
for GSDP-compliance. The product sourcing assessment, 
i.e., an evaluation by the expert of whether the products
supplied by the distributors come from reliable manufac-
turers (based on GMP certification), was conducted by
the expert according to the standard procedure as office
work. The rating of the QA activities in terms of compli-
ance with the WHO GSDP is separately reported in the
QUAMED access-controlled database. The study-specific
data were collected by the expert in a “data collection and
analysis tool”, where the completeness, clarity and accu-
racy of data collected remotely for each of the 12 QA
activities are rated. The information obtained for each
activity was rated by the expert in terms of completeness, 
clarity and accuracy on a 0–4 scale, where a value above 
3.5/4 corresponds to ‘excellent’,  a value between 2.5–
3.4/4, to ‘good’, and a value below 2.5/4, to ‘unsatisfactory’.
The overall quality per activity, on a 0–12 scale resulting
from the sum of completeness, clarity and accuracy, was
assessed as ‘excellent’ if the overall value was above 10.5
out of 12, as ‘good’ if between 7.8 and 10.4/12, and ‘unsat-
isfactory’ if below 7.7/12. Data were further aggregated
for the four distributors. Qualitative notes that helped
the expert to formulate the ratings were collected in a
“feedback forms” by the ICAFs, and in the notes taken by
the expert during the assessment. The data collection and
analysis tool is shown in Table 2.
Ethics
The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, 
Belgium (ref. 1422/20).  Distributors freely accepted to
be assessed, provided that their confidentiality was pro-
tected by not making them, nor the country, identifiable.
Results
Table 3 presents in aggregated form the results of the
expert’s assessment of the completeness, clarity and
accuracy of QA information obtained remotely for the
four distributors. The completeness, i.e.,  in terms of
questions that were answered in the standard QA ques-
tionnaire, was excellent (3.9 on a 0–4.0 scale), while the
clarity, i.e., the understandability of the information, and

the accuracy, i.e., the perceived reliability of the infor-
mation, were good (3.1 and 3.2 on a 0–4.0 scale, respec-
tively). The overall quality of data, calculated by summing
completeness, clarity and accuracy, was good (10.2 on a
0–12.0 scale). As shown in Table 3, there was little vari-
ability across distributors.
The difference between the quality of the information
prevalently assessed as office work (i.e., desk assessment 
of documentation on the QA system, documentation
system, human resources, and quality control) and the
quality of the information assessed during the remote
warehouse assessment (i.e.,  visit of the premises) was
small (10.4 versus 10.1). When it comes to the quality of
data collected for the 12 specific quality assurance activi-
ties, presented in Fig. 2, the lowest values (i.e., less than
10.0) are “handling non-conformity products”, “control at

reception” and “transport”. When it comes to the product
sourcing assessment, data provided by the distributors
were complete, clear and accurate. This is not surpris-
ing, as the product lists provided by email are subject to
a desk-assessment only, as it would happen for an on-site
visit.
The observed contextual limitations include poor
internet connection, particularly in warehouses, requir-
ing frequent repetitions after audio or videoconferenc-
ing breaks, some language barriers, and some lack of
familiarity in the study country with QA concepts and
terminology. Noteworthy, both ICAFs expressed a strong
interest to learn more on QA and to stay connected to
the study group, after the study.
Discussion
Some deviations were observed during the field work ver-
sus the planned procedures. In particular, we could not
compare the findings of this remote audit to the findings
of previous onsite audits (available for two out of four
distributor), since different data collection tools had been
used; the ICAF selection was not done by the QUAMED
technical coordinator, but by the expert who would have
worked with them, and the study-specific data on clarify, 
accuracy and completeness were not double checked by a
second expert, because this would have lacked essential
first-hand experience of the elements observed during
the technical visits. Importantly, our findings are explora-
tory and cannot be extrapolated to other contexts, nor to 
other types of (more complex) audits (GMP, MQAS etc.).
They should be confirmed in different contexts, with dif-
ferent levels of regulatory oversight, to check their rep-
licability. During the next research phases, more tools, 
such as smart glasses or screen sharing features, could
be tested. Furthermore, future research could use more
sophisticated designs, for instance, by getting distribu-
tors assessed by two different experts in a cross-over
sequence, by comparing results obtained at a same dis-
tributor with the support of different ICAFs, by adopting
a mixed method design to triangulate data from different
sources, and—importantly—by validating the methodol-
ogy by means of comparison of findings from remote and
on-site visits conducted at a same distributor.
Despite limitations, data remotely obtained for
assessing the GSDP-compliance of 12 essential QA
activities in our sample of four distributors was com-
plete, clear and accurate. Variations in overall quality
of data were small across distributors (range: 9.9–10.6),
across activities (range: 8.8–10.8),  and between data
obtained for QA activities that require a desk assess-
ment of documentation versus those purely based on
the visit of the premises (10.1 versus 10.4). This pilot
experience suggests that the intrinsic limitations of
remote assessments, e.g., unstable internet connection
(particularly in warehouses),  languages barrier and
impossibility for experts to personally verify premises
and documents, can be mitigated by adopting ade-
quate good practices. These include adequate audit
Page 8
Bourasseau et al. J of Pharm Policy and Pract (2021) 14:43  Page 8 of 9
preparation (e.g.,  list of documents to be assessed
sent to the distributor at least 5 working days upfront, 
print-outs as well as adequate tools for videoconfer-
encing should be prepared and tested upfront, etc.),
ensuring that the ‘’expert and ICAF’’ pair has language
skills adequate to the distributors’ context, and plan-
ning slightly more time than for an equivalent on-site
visit. Furthermore, the role of ICAFs seems crucial
for the performance of the remote assessment, as his/
her capacity to guide and orient the remote expert
will directly impact the assessment results. Therefore, 
other key components of the good practices are repre-
sented by the individualized training of ICAF, includ-
ing the essential of GSDP, planning sufficient time and
tools to collect the ICAF feedback on the audit, and
ICAFs’ ability to act as translators as needed. It could
also be helpful to have (smartphone) video filmed by a
third person, which would allow the expert to see both
the ICAF and the distributor representative, during
the visit of the warehouse. A careful implementation of
these good practices can ensure the feasibility and reli-
ability of remote assessments, to be adopted when an
onsite visit is not possible, either because of the pan-
demic, or of (low-intensity) conflicts, or other reasons.
Furthermore, the interest expressed by ICAFs to
keep on working at QA, suggests that remote assess-
ments can create the opportunity to raise awareness
among (international and local) staff of organiza-
tions that procure medical products about the need
to strengthen quality assurance systems, and they can
be a starting point to build local capacities. Another
potential advantage of the remote assessment is that
it can allow to interlink the routine operational activ-
ity (assessments) with research activity, given that data
collection and analysis can be better tracked and fol-
lowed. Furthermore, if remote assessments were in
the future validated as equivalent to the current gold
standard, i.e., the on-site assessments, they would also
have a positive environmental impact (we estimate that
for this pilot study, there was an approximate savings
of 1.2 tons of ­CO2 
emission), they would allow finan-
cial savings from spared costs of accommodation, visa
fees, per diem, and transport, and they would allow a
rapid responsiveness to urgent needs, which can be
relatively frequent particularly in humanitarian emer-
gency settings.
For the time being, in addition to being temporar-
ily used instead of on-site assessments when these are
unfeasible, remote assessments could also be used as
routine tools to complement and strengthen the on-
site assessments. For instance, a remote assessment
could be set up to pre-screen the distributors proposed
for on-site assessment, and avoid unnecessary visits at 
suppliers which are of very poor quality, with addi-
tional savings. Furthermore, the remote methodology
could be used for improving the auditor’s follow-up of
the corrective action plan from onsite visits.
Conclusion
Our exploratory findings suggest that in case of excep-
tional circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic, 
a remote assessment of pharmaceutical distributors
conducted according to the identified good practices
and with the support of a trained ICAF, can provide
data of acceptable quality; allow to adequately assess
GSDP compliance; and allow to make temporary deci-
sions about licensing (regulators) or purchasing (inter-
national organizations, NGOs).
At the moment, on-site assessments remain the gold
standards, so the use of remote assessments outside
exceptional circumstances and for temporary deci-
sions, would be conditional upon formal validation of
this methodology. Meanwhile, the use of remote assess-
ments could be separately considered as part of routine
assessments, both for pre-screening candidates for on-
site assessments, and for targeted follow-up of on-site
assessment.
