Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) impact on the mental health of healthcare workers is extremely
detrimental. It is imperative that the psychological health of all healthcare workers be protected. However, an often
overlooked member of the healthcare frontline is the pharmacist. Pharmacists provide many types of essential
services during the pandemic, which often cannot be done from a remote location. Being frontline healthcare
workers, pharmacists have experienced an increase in the number of patients seen, the amount of screening and
triage being done, the amount of COVID-19 information being delivered, the number of medication shortages, and
the amount of workplace harassment taking place. These activities increase the amount of stress, burden, and
frustration felt by pharmacists have a negative impact on their mental health and well-being. This article seeks to
address the specific implications of COVID-19 on the mental health of pharmacists.

Background
COVID-19 is a severe infectious respiratory disease caused
by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) whose first case of
infection occurred on December 31, 2019, in Wuhan,
China [1].  The World Health Organization (WHO) has
officially declared it a global pandemic on March 11, 2020
[2]. COVID-19 is transmitted person-to-person via drop-
lets produced by coughing, sneezing, speaking, and
through contact with contaminated surfaces [1]. A state of
emergency was declared, leading to social distancing and
closures of schools, and non-essential businesses across
Canada [3]. These measures were implemented to control
the physical spread of COVID-19 and ramifications on the
population’s mental health.
The challenging conditions imposed causes increased
stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and exacerbation of
pre-existing mental illness [4–7]. Social isolation is strongly
associated with poor mental health outcomes [8–10],

especially in the context of COVID-19 [6, 11, 12]. If left
unchecked, a mental health crisis could come out of the
current COVID-19 pandemic. These mental health issues
extend to healthcare workers (HCWs) who work on the
front line to treat those who are infected [12].  HCWs
worldwide report the negative psychological effects of
COVID-19, such as stress, fear, anxiety, depression, burn-
out, and mental exhaustion [7, 12–19].
Pharmacists are one of the frontline HCWs working
diligently to provide much-needed services during the pan-
demic [20–26].  Pharmacist-provided services have shown
to improve patient outcomes and contribute to healthcare
savings [26]. Community pharmacists provide COVID-19
screening and medication dispensing to maintain continuity
of care, disseminate critical information regarding COVID-
19, collaborate closely with other HCWs and government
organizations, engage in home medication delivery, and
remain the most accessible healthcare member that patients
can interact with [25].  Hospital pharmacists directly
support physicians, nurses, and other staff in managing life-
saving medications for COVID-19 patients, participating in
patient rounds, and engaging in infectious disease control

[20, 25–27].  Unfortunately, pharmacists are often over-
looked and are underrepresented regarding advocacy [25].
In this editorial, we will address pharmacist-specific mental
health issues as well as methods to support pharmacists’
psychological well-being.
Pharmacists experience issues common to all HCWs
during COVID-19. Both community and hospital phar-
macists experience a lack of personal protective equip-
ment (PPE). Long work hours are required for treating
the increased number of scared and frustrated patients,
along with increased responsibility and pressure.
Increased risk of infection resulting from work-related
exposure leads HCWs to self-isolate, which can result in
feelings of isolation and loneliness. However, due to the
pharmacist’s  unique role, they will also experience
pharmacist-specific issues as summarized in Fig. 1.
Increased burden on pharmacist roles leads to
decreased pharmacist mental well-being
First point of patient contact
As one of the most easily accessible HCWs, pharma-
cists are often the first point of contact for many 
patients. Pharmacists may experience an increase in
the number of patients seen during the pandemic. A
survey of nine major hospitals in the USA showed a
significant decrease in the number of ST-segment
elevation cardiac catheterization laboratory activa-
tions during the pandemic [28],  indicating that there
is a possibility that fewer patients are seeking hos-
pital care. Understandably, many patients who have
non-COVID-19-related illnesses may be hesitant to
go directly to a hospital or other similar institutions
for fear of contracting COVID-19 [29, 30].  Instead
of going to a hospital, they may present themselves
to a pharmacy to receive guidance from a pharma-
cist, which results in a decrease in the number of
non-essential hospital visits and allows healthcare re-
sources reallocation to treat COVID-19. However,
this could lead to a strain on community pharma-
cists as they attempt to fill that clinical role. The
resulting increased workload will add to the burden,
leading to burnout among pharmacy staff, which is
detrimental to individual well-being and compromis-
ing the quality of care provided [31].

Patient triage
Pharmacists also engage in patient triage [32].  While
there may exist some increased risk of contracting
COVID-19 in clinics and hospitals, patients who need
care should not be afraid to seek care. Pharmacists can
provide over the phone, and in-person screening of
COVID-19 symptoms as well as appropriately redirect
patients to other healthcare facilities. The importance of
continuity of care is amplified during a pandemic and
demonstrates the importance of pharmacist triage.
However, it is not always easy to triage and prioritize pa-
tients—difficult decisions often must be made. This also
emphasizes the importance of adequate PPE, as screen-
ing exposes pharmacists to the risk of infection and con-
tamination. Both the burden of appropriate triage and
the absence of peace of mind against the disease contrib-
ute to the stress that pharmacists face.
Information dissemination
As pharmacists provide essential information regarding
COVID-19 to the public in an easy to access manner, they
must stay up to date on the latest pandemic developments.
Pharmacists help patients navigate fact from fiction as well
as educate on proper hygiene and infection control. This is
important as misconceptions about COVID-19 can exacer-
bate worry and other mental health concerns [5, 22].
However, pharmacists find themselves under constant
bombardment of COVID-19 related information, which
can be overwhelming and affect overall mental well-being
[33]. The Canadian Pharmacist Association (CPhA) recom-
mends that pharmacists limit the amount of time per day
spent reviewing news, to only focus on the general trajec-
tory, and to distract your mind with other tasks, among
other suggestions [33].  Pharmacists can also use adverse
drug reaction (ADR) and medical device incident (MDI)
reporting to facilitate misinformation correction [34]. The
demand for COVID-19 therapies drives the rampant adop-
tion of potential medications, even when there is insuffi-
cient evidence for its efficacy and safety [34].  Thus, the
vigilant reporting of ADRs is more critical than ever to
combat misinformation.
Managing medication shortages
Pharmacists are also managing medication shortages and
limited resources during COVID-19 [35, 36]. Before the
pandemic, medication shortages were already a global
issue [20]. The spread of COVID-19 generated a spike in
the number of critically ill patients and fear-based medi-
cation hoarding contributing to the pre-existing short-
ages [35, 36].  During the first week of May 2020, only
3% of pharmacies across Canada reported receiving their
full medication order for every order placed [37]. Medi-
cation shortages disrupt care and pose safety concerns
for patients. Two drugs that have been publicized as 
candidates for the treatment of COVID-19, hydroxy-
chloroquine and chloroquine, have now become difficult
to obtain for patients who need these agents to manage
rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and
other autoimmune disorders [35, 36]. Canadian pharma-
cists are spending 24% of their shift dealing with medica-
tion shortages, placing a huge burden [37]. While most
of medication shortage issues are out of the pharmacists’
control, there are some initiatives pharmacists have
taken to tackle the problem. Pharmacists can find alter-
native sources, alternative therapies, and rationing exist-
ing drug supplies. One such proposed method is to
sterilize metered-dose inhalers used once or twice in
hospitals so that they can be reused [38]. In addition to
technical difficulties in managing medication shortages,
there are also ethical dilemmas when deciding to prioritize
one patient over another, which can also be damaging to
mental well-being. This results in something known as
moral injury, described as “the psychological distress
which results from actions, or lack of them, which violate
someone’s moral or ethical code.” [39]
Harassment from patients
An unfortunate circumstance that pharmacists have to
face is harassment and abuse. In a national survey con-
ducted by CPhA, 73% of pharmacists report an increase
in harassment, verbal abuse, and other forms of abuse by
patients ever since the pandemic began [40]. Anecdotal
accounts also exist of healthcare workers experiencing
stigma and abuse due to the public’s fear of contracting
COVID-19 from someone who has high exposure to the
virus [31, 41]. In such a perilous time, it is understand-
able that patients will feel frustrated, angry, and fright-
ened. However, pharmacists do not deserve to be poorly
treated. It is important to let them know that pharma-
cists are doing their best to support patient health
throughout the pandemic and beyond. As a result of the
power dynamics at play, it is ultimately up to pharma-
cists to be able to reassure patients and provide care, all
while taking into account their mental health. Currently,
guidelines regarding patient interaction during a pan-
demic are needed.
An additional burden Asian pharmacists face on top of
pharmacist harassment is the rise of anti-Asian racism
that has come about due to COVID-19. Verbal and even
physical abuse has been reported to happen in various
countries, such as the UK, France, and the USA, to those
of Chinese descent [41, 42]. Asian frontline workers are
being told that the virus “came from [their] kind” and
going so far as to call SARS-CoV-2 the “Chinese virus”
[41, 42]. These reactions are fueled by fear and misinfor-
mation, which speaks to the damage that this kind of
misinformation can cause if not corrected. Such racism
should not be tolerated, seeing as it has such profound
Page 4
Elbeddini et al. Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice (2020) 13:46  Page 4 of 6
adverse effects on pharmacists and individuals’  well-
being, community cohesiveness, and impeding the fight
against COVID-19. Additional research is needed to
address the mental health and long term consequences
of anti-Asian sentiments and to develop initiatives and
policies that seek to reduce such behaviors.
Significance
Mental health care for HCWs is more critical now than
ever. According to CPhA, pharmacists’  mental health
was among the top four pharmacists’  greatest concerns
during COVID-19, along with personal and staff safety,
drug shortages, and workload/staffing shortages [40].
Poor HCW mental health may lead to decreased quality
of care, attention paid, and decision-making ability [13],
but pharmacist-specific data is lacking. One study looked
at the job satisfaction of hospital pharmacists in Ethiopia
[43],  which can be considered another indicator of the
pharmacists’  well-being. Pharmacists with low job satis-
faction often have less productivity and lower overall
quality of life [43]. On the contrary, high job satisfaction
positively impacts performance, employee relationships,
mental health, and life satisfaction [43]. During such dire
times, pharmacists are being relied upon more and more
to provide much-needed services during the pandemic.
Pharmacists, like other HCWs, know how important
their role is and are resilient in providing care even at
the expense of their own mental and physical well-being
[24, 44]. It is well known that mental illness is associated
with lower life expectancy and poorer health outcomes
than the general population, increasing the risk of infec-
tion with COVID-19 [45].  It is uncertain what exactly
the long-term sequelae may be, but there is evidence
that such sequelae exist. It was found that 3 years after
the SARS outbreak in 2003, high-risk HCWs remained
highly stressed, which was associated with higher levels
of depression, anxiety, and general psychological distress
[46–48]. The stress generated by COVID-19 for HCWs
is akin to that of a natural disaster or international mass
conflict [5]. While it might make sense during the begin-
ning of the outbreak to prioritize physical health or psycho-
logical, it should not stay this way. COVID-19 is as much
of a somatic battle as it is a mental battle. If unaddressed,
poor mental health can have more serious consequences
down the line and may lead to a shortage of pharmacists
and other HCWs after the pandemic is over [5].
Future directions
While they do exist, the number of resources offered to
manage mental health is scant. CPhA provides info-
graphics and links to province-specific pharmacy mental
health resources, and nationwide and American pharma-
cist resources [33, 49].  Multidisciplinary mental health
services must also be explicitly provided for pharmacists 
and other HCWs as they experience more extreme
psychologic symptoms [19].  More awareness should be
generated for these resources and the importance of
pharmacists’ mental health during COVID-19.
Healthcare delivery is progressing in the direction of
telemedicine and virtual methods of delivery. Mental
health is a very good candidate for electronic delivery
[50, 51].  This can be extended to providing mental
health care to pharmacists and other HCWs. Blake et al.
assessed a digital learning package that consisted of
evidence-based guidance, actions to take, and self-care
strategies relating to maintaining mental well-being for
HCWs in the UK [31].  They found that it was well-
received with high user satisfaction [31].  The material
was better received if it addressed specific issues that
were relevant to healthcare work environments and the
type of work healthcare workers engaged in [31].  This
further proves the importance of having more pharmacy-
specific mental health resources. Besides focusing on the
individual, fostering a culture of resilience and support
within an organization strongly affects worker stress and
protects mental health [31, 39, 52]. In addition to provid-
ing care, pharmacists must also have tools to assess
mental health in the context of COVID-19 to identify
individuals at risk quickly and not to over- or under-
diagnose [53].  Finally, it would be good to learn from
previous pandemics and other countries regarding their
response to HCW mental health. Being the epicenter of
COVID-19, China had some rapid response to improving
the mental health of their HCWs [7]. The Second Xiangya
Hospital in China’s Hubei province developed a detailed
psychological intervention plan, a psychological assistance
hotline team and psychological interventions to improve
HCW mental health [54]. The National Health Commis-
sion of China integrated psychological crisis intervention
into general measures for disease prevention, issued the
“Principles for Emergency Psychological Crisis Interven-
tion for COVID-19 Pneumonia Epidemic,” as well as a
plethora of mental health guidelines made by various
healthcare organizations [55].
Overall, the pharmaceutical system itself could be
strengthened, which could go beyond just mitigating
drug shortages and help pharmacist workflow and well-
being. Hafner et al. report three issues that stand in the
way of low- and middle-income countries being able to
strengthen their pharmaceutical systems [56], which also
applies to Canada as its pharmaceutical systems become
strained due to COVID-19 and issues become apparent.
Firstly, the process of strengthening a pharmaceutical
system is lengthy and resource intensive [56], which may
not be feasibly done in time during COVID-19. Sec-
ondly, strengthening pharmaceutical systems requires
the engagement of government bodies and multiple
stakeholders as well as policy and legislation reform [56],
Page 5
Elbeddini et al. Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice (2020) 13:46  Page 5 of 6
which Canada is currently engaging in for managing
the immediate COVID-19 threat. Finally, the interven-
tions that work to strengthen pharmaceutical systems
are not precisely known, which is an area of further
research [56].
Summary
The mental health of HCWs during the COVID-19 pan-
demic needs to be addressed. Pharmacists are frontline
HCWs and belong in this category as they provide ne-
cessary services amid the pandemic. As one of the most
accessible HCWs, they face many stressors that need to
be specifically targeted to address pharmacists mental
health issues effectively. All in all, more research and
resources need to be developed to provide solutions for
the declining psychological well-being of pharmacists
and HCWs in general amid COVID-19.
