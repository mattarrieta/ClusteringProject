Abstract 
This commentary shares the experience of a hospital pharmacy department in providing healthcare services during
the COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia. During this pandemic, the medication delivery system is redesigned to minimize
contact among patients and the health care providers. Also, the remote medication monitoring system was imple‑
mented to deliver pharmaceutical care for inpatients. Communication technology was used to assist the pharmacist
in medication counseling. QR codes to access videos demonstrating the use of devices were made available for
patients. Pharmacists were also tasked with the procurement of personal protective equipment and medications
needed requiring special approval from the Ministry of Health.

Introduction
Malaysian government-funded health facilities are most
strongly affected by the COVID-19 (2019 coronavirus
disease) pandemic, as 82% of inpatient care is supported
by these facilities [1]. One such state-operated tertiary
referral hospital is Hospital Raja Permaisuri Bainun, 
which has a capacity of 990 beds and has been directed to
cater to COVID-19 patients from other health facilities
within the state of Perak.
The pharmacists in this hospital have been tasked to
tackle pharmaceutical care issues and problems during
the pandemic. This article is aimed at sharing the experi-
ences of pharmacists in a Malaysian hospital with respect
to healthcare preparedness and response during the pan-
demic. These experiences can inform the formulation of
ideas for future research, add to knowledge relevant to

Sustaining supply chains
The lockdown implemented in most countries has caused
difficulties for pharmacy departments in procuring medi-
cal supplies, particularly medications for the manage-
ment of COVID-19. Notably, medicines for off-label use
as treatment for the disease are not included in the for-
mulary of the Malaysian Ministry of Health (MOH) [2].
The pharmacy department at Hospital Raja Permaisuri
Bainun consistently communicates with the pharma-
ceutical service division at the national level to secure
expedited approval to procure the aforementioned medi-
cations and supply these to four other specialist hospitals
within Perak.
To monitor inventory levels, pharmacists update
records of the daily usage of medications on a centralized
online database created by the MOH [3]. Hospital phar-
macists also constantly communicate with pharmacy
departments at the state level to obtain medical supplies

for routine use in their hospitals. These responsibilities
are in line with the strategies implemented in other coun-
tries where pharmacists lead the work involved in the
medicine supply chain by conducting active surveillance
[4].
To cope with the global shortage in personal protec-
tive equipment (PPE) and hand sanitizers [4], multiple
strategies have been implemented in this country. These
include the creation (sewing) of PPEs by healthcare
workers from all disciplines and the acceptance of PPE
donations from non-governmental organizations and
the public. To ensure the quality of donated PPEs, each
item received is inspected by pharmacists and infection
control teams. Furthermore, through the national Phar-
maceutical Services Programme, a special budget was
allocated for the purchase of PPEs and the development
of a PPE tracker—an online spreadsheet that all facilities
use to update daily PPE balance. To address the tempo-
rary shortage of hand sanitizers, certain facilities have
produced their own following published formulations [5].
Redesigning the drug indentation and delivery system
The drug indentation and delivery system in this hospi-
tal was redesigned to minimize contact among healthcare
providers and patients in the hospital.
Outpatient pharmacy services
Changes to outpatient pharmacy services were imple-
mented to reduce the number of patients queuing at
counters. These changes include dispensing 2 months’ 
worth of medication supply and extensively promoting
pharmacy value-added services (VASs) to the public via
direct communication and social media. VASs enable
patients to obtain medication refills through their pre-
ferred methods, such as delivery by post, drive-through
pickup, storage in a designated medicine locker, and
acquisition via an integrated drug dispensing system. 
These services minimize contact between pharmacists
and patients and therefore reduce crowding at outpatient
pharmacies [6].
To ensure the continuity of care and easy access to
medications, the outpatient pharmacy in this hospital
continues to operate on a 24-h basis. The patients’ wait-
ing area was modified in accordance with the physical
distancing criterion (1-m distance),  while pharmacists
stationed at the counter are required to wear a face shield
over a surgical mask and maintain adequate distance
from patients [7].
Inpatient pharmacy services
We reinforced the medication indentation process
through an electronic system called the Pharmacy Infor-
mation System (PhIS), which enables online prescription, 
medication supply, medication administration, and
counseling documentation. The medicines prescribed by
a physician via the PhIS are then prepared by the inpa-
tient pharmacy and distributed to wards. The drug dis-
tribution system was modified from a unit-of-dose to a
unit-of-use basis, whereby the frequency at which medi-
cations are supplied was reduced from daily to 3 times
per week. Medication supply to wards involves delivery
to a designated work area that is cleaned in accordance
with standard protocols. Only medication to be admin-
istered is brought to a patient’s bed. Unused medications
at the work area are retrieved for decontamination with
70% alcohol solution.
In addition, drug delivery using a medication trolley
has been withheld for all COVID-19 wards. All medica-
tions are instead packed in a plastic zipper bag for single
use [8]. Each bag for each patient contains a 1-week sup-
ply of orally administered medications and a 3-day supply
of injected forms. Meanwhile, floor stock lists in wards
were modified with additional medications required for
relieving COVID-19 symptoms; these include chlorphe-
niramine and diphenhydramine.
Pharmaceutical care services in wards
In non-COVID-19 wards, to ensure the continuity of
core pharmacy services provided to wards, such as medi-
cation reconciliation, drug dosage recommendation, 
and antimicrobial stewardship monitoring, pharmacists
wear appropriate PPEs, such as surgical masks and face
shields. To practice physical distancing, case discussions
among pharmacists and clinicians—commonly held at
bedside—are now conducted away from patient cubicles
to reduce contact time with patients.
In COVID-19 wards, the entry of healthcare workers
is strictly controlled, with full PPE required and only one
medical doctor allowed to conduct a clinical assessment
of patients. These restrictions are meant to reduce the
risk of exposure to the virus among healthcare workers
and minimize the consumption of dwindling PPE stocks. 
Ward pharmacists have taken the initiative to perform
remote pharmaceutical care for COVID-19 patients by
reviewing drug charts through the PhIS. Interventions
are carried out by communicating with prescribers in the
wards via telephone call, video conferencing, and mes-
saging through WhatsApp should any pharmaceutical-
related problems be detected.
Clinical pharmacists participate in weekly discus-
sions with other healthcare workers using online plat-
forms. Patient cases are summarized, discussed, and
given intervention as needed to keep abreast of the lat-
est guidelines and evidence for the use of antibiotics
in managing COVID-19. Pharmaceutical care issues
related to COVID-19 patients, including drug therapy,

Fig. 1  Modified spacer with instruction to use
dosage, duration of treatment, outcomes, and adverse
drug reactions, are reported by clinical pharmacists to
the Pharmaceutical Services Programme via a centralized
drug monitoring database [3]. These reports serve as an
important input for updating COVID-19 management
guidelines in Malaysia.
Warded patients requiring assistance with device
usage are given pamphlets printed with QR codes that
link to a video demonstrating the technique for using a
device. Patients are allowed to select their preferred lan-
guage. An alternative is the recently introduced virtual
counseling service, which provides real-time counseling
allows pharmacists to interact with patients [9]. However, 
patients who do not own mobile devices are unable to use
these services.
To minimize aerosol-related transmission, metered
dose inhalers are used in place of nebulizers in the treat-
ment of acute asthma in COVID-19 patients. A spacer
device is created by modifying a 500-mL plastic bottle, 
which enables the attachment of a metered dose inhaler
to one end of the spacer and the inhalation of medication
from the other end (Fig. 1) [10].
Conclusion
A state hospital’s experience is a valuable learning pro-
cess that helps pharmacists better prepare for handling
future public health emergencies. Limited resources
in the field of digital health and a lack of experience in
disaster management warrant attention of health poli-
cymakers to improve these aspects. Nevertheless, with
good leadership, teamwork, and innovative efforts among
pharmacists and all healthcare workers, these challenges
have been overcome.
