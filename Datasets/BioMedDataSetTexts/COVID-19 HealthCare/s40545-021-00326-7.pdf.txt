Abstract 
Reports of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) following the administration of coro-
navirus vaccines have raised concerns regarding their safety. Although no regulatory authority has recognized ICH
as an adverse event associated with tozinameran (BNT162b2, Pfizer-BioNTech), fatal and non-fatal cases have been
reported. In Japan, 10 fatal cases (five men and women) have been reported to date. Four of the five women died of
ICH and the other died of aspiration pneumonia, whereas all five men died of causes other than stroke. This imbalance
is incompatible with the mortality data on cardiovascular diseases in the National Statistics, which show no apparent
disparity between sexes or between hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. Cumulatively, our analysis reveals a dispro-
portionately high incidence of death by ICH in Japanese women who received tozinameran, suggesting a potential
association of ICH with the vaccine. Although we understand that the benefits of tozinameran still outweigh the risks, 
we believe that a causal link with the vaccine is not proven but possible and warrants further analysis.
Introduction
Recent experience with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 [1] has dem-
onstrated that pharmacovigilance is essential for the early
detection of signs of severe adverse events. Reports of
immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) following the admin-
istration of vaccines against severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have raised con-
cerns regarding their safety [1–5]. Cerebral venous sinus
thrombosis (CVST) resulting from ITP is a neurovascular
emergency typically affecting young adults and is more
common in women than in men. CVST often results in
a potentially fatal intracranial hemorrhage (ICH; intrac-
erebral and/or subarachnoid hemorrhage) [6]. Although
no regulatory authority has recognized ICH as an adverse
event associated with tozinameran (BNT162b2, Pfizer-
BioNTech), fatal and non-fatal cases have been reported

genetic vaccines [1, 2] are proposed to induce ITP and
internal bleeding.
Disproportionately high incidence of death by ICH
in Japanese women who received tozinameran
The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) 
initiated tozinameran vaccinations on February 17, 
2021 for healthcare workers. Vaccines other than tozi-
nameran remain unapproved and unavailable in Japan. 
As of April 18, 2021, an estimated 1.21 million first and
0.72 million second doses of tozinameran have been
administered. The MHLW has reported 10 fatal cases
(five men and five women) to date [7]. Four of these 10
cases died of ICH; all of these were women who died
after the first shot. No fatal case with ischemic stroke
has been reported. The remaining six cases comprised
five men and one woman. The woman died of aspira-
tion pneumonia 4 days after the first shot. The five
men died of causes other than stroke, i.e., acute heart
failure, drowning, ventricular fibrillation, sepsis, and

cardiopulmonary arrest of unknown origin. Here, we
describe the histories of the four ICH cases listed on
the MHLW website [7]. In three of the four cases, the
clinical course and unwitnessed death of a previously
healthy woman with unremarkable history or risk fac-
tors of cerebrovascular diseases were atypical of the
common types of cerebral hemorrhage, e.g., putaminal, 
thalamic, and cerebellar. No platelet count or other test
data were available for three of the four cases because
they were found dead at home. Details of the postmor-
tem examination, i.e., imaging and autopsy, were also
unavailable.
Case 1 was a 61-year-old woman with no significant
history. She was found dead at home by her husband
3 days after receiving the first shot of tozinameran, with
no episode reported in the intervening time. A spinal tap
revealed bloody cerebrospinal fluid. Neither autopsy nor
postmortem imaging study was performed.
Case 2 was a 26-year-old woman with no underlying
conditions. After the first shot of tozinameran, her sub-
sequent course was unremarkable until she was found
dead 4 days later at home. Postmortem imaging revealed
a hematoma 3.5 cm in diameter at the left cerebellopon-
tine angle compressing the brainstem and secondary sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage.
Case 3 was a 72-year-old woman with hepatitis C and
dyslipidemia. Three days after the first shot of tozina-
meran, she developed dysarthria with complaints of
headache and nausea. Brain imaging revealed a large
hematoma with ventricular rupture. Her platelet count
was 216,000/mm3.  She died 5 days after receiving
tozinameran.
Case 4 was a 69-year-old woman. No underlying condi-
tion was specified. She had been well until she was found
dead at home 9 days after the first shot of tozinameran. 
An autopsy revealed that she died of ICH. No other
information was available.
Case 5 was a 102-year-old woman with chronic heart
failure. Ten days before the first shot, she had developed
aspiration pneumonia, which was empirically treated
with clarithromycin. She died 4 days after receiving
tozinameran. Thrombocytopenia was not reported. The
cause of death was considered to be aspiration pneumo-
nia, which was revealed by computed tomography. No
autopsy was performed.
Case 6 was a 65-year-old man with an unremarkable
history. He was reported to have been well at 18 days
after the first shot. He was found dead at home 3 days
later when a policeman, informed of his absence from
the office, visited to ask for him. Postmortem inspection
showed blood coagula in the oral cavity. He was pre-
sumed to have died of acute heart failure on the grounds
that his living conditions suggested alcoholism and heavy 
smoking. No autopsy or other postmortem examination
was performed.
Case 7 was a 62-year-old man with hypertension, dia-
betes, and obesity. He was reported to have taken an
unspecified anti-thrombotic drug. On the day after the
second shot of tozinameran, he was found dead in the
bathtub by a housemate. Autopsy of the lungs revealed
the cause of death to be drowning without ICH or any
other significant pathology.
Case 8 was a 51-year-old man with no underlying con-
ditions. He was found apneic in bed at midnight 14 days
after the first shot. He was transferred to a hospital, but
resuscitation failed. His housemate was informed that he
had died of ventricular fibrillation. No autopsy or other
postmortem examination was performed.
Case 9 was a 73-year-old man with chronic renal fail-
ure. He had been on hemodialysis for 6 months before
the second shot. In the night after the shot, he became
febrile with vascular access infections and purulent verte-
bral osteomyelitis. Thrombocytopenia was not reported. 
He died of septic shock 8 days later. No autopsy was
performed.
Case 10 was a 37-year-old man. He was reported to
have had a history of unspecified arrhythmia, electrocar-
diographic anomaly, and hay fever. He had been well until
he was found dead in bed in the morning 3 days after the
second shot. No autopsy or other postmortem examina-
tion was performed.
Sex imbalance in ICH incidence
The MHLW concluded that these data did not show a
link between tozinameran vaccination and the deaths
because ICH can occur naturally and is happening more
frequently in the general population than in the vacci-
nated population [8]. However, this conclusion could be
misleading when the risk of side effects is as low as 3.9
in every million doses [3]. To detect remarkable signals
with higher sensitivity, we focused on the sex imbal-
ance in ICH incidence. Four of the five deceased women
died of ICH and the other died of aspiration pneumonia, 
whereas all five men died of causes other than stroke. 
This imbalance is incompatible with the mortality data
on cardiovascular diseases in the National Statistics [9],
which show no apparent disparity between sexes. First, 
the death rate by ICH (363/million) is 25% lower than
that by ischemic stroke (486/million). Second, the death
rate by ICH is comparable between the sexes (371/mil-
lion in men and 355/million in women). Third, although
the death rate by heart disease (1622/million in men and
1728/million in women) is > 4 times higher in both sexes
than that by ICH, three men but no women died of heart
disease after the administration of tozinameran. Cumu-
latively, our analysis reveals a disproportionately high

incidence of death by ICH in women who received tozi-
nameran in Japan.
Imminent concern
The imminent concern would be ITP and CVST, which
were observed in 19 patients (8 men and 11 women) 
who received the Pfizer vaccine in the USA [4]. On the
basis of data from the UK, there is no evidence that
women have higher mortality from ITP than men [3].
The lack of information essential for the diagnosis does
not allow us any presumption of the cause of the dispro-
portionately high incidence of death by ICH in women
who received tozinameran in Japan. Reinforcement of
the Japanese pharmacovigilance of SARS-CoV-2 vacci-
nation is urgently required. We appeal to the MHLW to
issue a caution notice to the public and healthcare pro-
fessionals and to support them in monitoring thrombotic
events more closely with appropriate feedback. In par-
ticular, the MHLW should list ITP-related symptoms for
which vaccinated individuals should seek urgent medical
consultation. Next, the ministry should assure continual
monitoring of the situation and further review of ITP
and ICH associated with tozinameran. During such phar-
macovigilance, the early signs of rare side effects require
intensive scientific investigations and clinical appraisal to
exclude a causal link.
Conclusions
Regulatory authorities are responsible for warning
the public regarding the side effects of vaccines. Post-
approval safety evaluation of new interventions such
as SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is key to the identification of
their optimal benefit–risk balance. Although we under-
stand that the benefits of tozinameran still outweigh the
risks, we believe that a causal link with the vaccine is not
proven but possible and warrants further analysis.
