Abstract
Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Lebanese government has taken the proactive anticipatory
measure to minimize the infection rates. Despite the pivotal role of the pharmacists working in hospital settings,
hospital pharmacists have not been engaged in the emergency preparedness for hospitals. The primary objective of
this survey is to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of hospital pharmacists in Lebanon towards COVID-19
pandemic and explore the level of health emergency preparedness of Lebanese hospitals in response to this
outbreak.
Methods: A standardized English-based, anonymous and online questionnaire was diffused via social media
platforms to all Lebanese hospital pharmacists. The questionnaire consisted of 78 questions related to
sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge-based, attitude-based, practice questions, and pandemic
preparedness. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to summarize data.
Results: A total of 81 questionnaires were completed; the participants were able to know > 90% of the knowledge-
based questions regarding COVID-19. Most of the respondents were concerned about getting infected and their
families due to their professional exposure. Similarly, around 67% were following the safety recommendations. Most
of the participants agreed that they are facing shortages, rising prices, and delays in supply of masks and sanitizers.
In terms of COVID-19 readiness, about 50% of hospitals have taken practical steps.
Conclusions: Our findings revealed an appropriate level of knowledge and good practice towards COVID-19,
among the respondents from Lebanese hospitals. National organizations may benefit in utilizing the expertise of
the hospital pharmacists to be able to minimize/avoid future waves of COVID-19 if it emerges.

Background
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a significant health
and economic challenge for the global and development
of the community [1]. In less than a month, the global
number of confirmed COVID-19 cases doubled from
about 75,000 cases on February 20 to more than 153,000
on March 15 to reach 6,400,000 on June 2 [1, 2]. That
infection rate, as scary as it sounds, hides just how much
the out-of-control virus has spread, especially in the
hardest-hit communities. Efforts to completely contain
the new coronavirus, responsible for infecting people in
213 countries and territories [2],  have failed. Although
the profile of the disease suggests that 80% of cases are
mild, some 15% of people react severely while 5% be-
come severely ill (septic shock, respiratory, and organ
failure) [3]. Severe cases affect patients with underlying
conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension,
and diabetes or elderly; older age is a particular concern
in many countries with aging populations [3]. Transmis-
sion can occur from person to person by droplets from
an infected individual or contaminated surfaces or ob-
jects [4].
No known effective treatment for COVID-19 virus ex-
ists [5]; therefore, management is largely intensive sup-
portive care [5]. Many experimental therapies including
existing anti-infective agents, including antibiotics, anti-
virals, and antiparasitics, in addition to antibody therapy
are being studied and may be useful in the future [5].
New molecules also continue to be evaluated and tested
as potential future antiviral therapies against the
COVID-19 virus and others [5].  The most impactful
intervention would be the implementation of an effective
vaccine during an outbreak event. Many COVID-19 vac-
cine candidates are currently being studied in early
phase trials. As there is currently no vaccine or specific
medication to treat COVID-19 [6], and because testing
is so limited, the only way to flatten the curve [7] is
through collective action. The US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that
all Americans wash their hands frequently, [URL: "https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-how-to-self-quarantine.html"] self-isolate
when they are sick or suspect they might be, and start
“social distancing” (essentially, avoiding other people
whenever possible) right away [8].
Governments across the world have responded to the
pandemic with a set of actions including closures of
schools and public attractions, implementation of travel
bans, quarantines, and nationwide lockdowns [9].  Se-
quentially, the [URL: "https://www.devex.com/focus/covid-19?access_key="] COVID-19 pandemic has created an un-
precedented disruption of the economy [10].
In general, emergencies put health systems and their
ability to deliver health care services under strain. Cur-
rently, health care services in the various regions around
the world are being confronted with increased demand
generated by the COVID-19 outbreak [11]. When health 
systems are overwhelmed, morbidity is exacerbated, dis-
ability intensifies, and both mortality from the outbreak
and mortality from vaccine-preventable and treatable
conditions increase [12].  Responding exclusively to
COVID-19 cases, without considering how the delivery
of essential health care services will be maintained across
the continuum of care from prevention to palliation,
comes with several risks [12]. Organizations fighting in-
fectious diseases, supporting health workers and deliver-
ing social services, have become the center of attention.
But their work is complicated by a set of challenges re-
lated to access, safety, supply chain logistics, and finan-
cial stress [13].
The COVID-19 pandemic is primarily a health shock
[14]. Knowing that the primary objective is health emer-
gency, countries have focused their attention on a set of
critical interventions [15].
Several European countries have shared common con-
cerns about the readiness and capacity of their health
systems to respond to the novel coronavirus (SARS-
CoV-2) COVID-19 pandemic [3].
The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists
(ASHP) has highlighted the role of the pharmacist in
emergency preparedness, including biological disasters
[16],  and has made available COVID-19 Pandemic As-
sessment tools intended to assist pandemic planning ef-
forts in the department of pharmacy and to foster
pharmacist involvement in preparedness at the institu-
tional and community level [17]. Other pharmacy orga-
nizations such as the International Pharmaceutical
Federation (FIP) have dedicated a set of resources to
help pharmacists during this pandemic [18].  In fact,
pharmacists have an important multifaceted role in dis-
aster preparedness and disaster response. The American
Pharmacists Association (APhA) mentioned in its Policy
Manual disaster preparedness section published in 2015
that the APhA “encourages pharmacist involvement in
surveillance, mitigation, preparedness, planning, re-
sponse, and recovery related to bioterrorism and emer-
ging infectious diseases” [19].  Pharmacists, being the
medication experts [20], should lead in managing medi-
cation supply chains and distribution systems such as
procurement, storage, compounding, and dispensing in
emergencies [16, 19, 21].  Furthermore, pharmacist ex-
pertise will help in guiding treatment decisions and drug
information questions for the most vulnerable individ-
uals including children, elderly, pregnant women, and
immunocompromised patients, as well as developing
local treatment plans. Besides, pharmacists possess the
ability to provide direct patient care by medication ther-
apy management, adherence counseling, and monitoring
(particularly for the long durations of PEP) [1, 22]. This
is particularly true for hospital pharmacists. In Lebanon,
the government and the Ministry of Public Health
Page 3
Zeenny et al. Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice (2020) 13:54  Page 3 of 12
(MOPH) have taken the proactive anticipatory decision
of closure and were able to raise awareness to keep the
numbers of patients infected with COVID-19 to the
minimal [23].  As of June 2, 2020, the total number of
confirmed cases is 1242 with 27 deaths overall. The ma-
jority of the cases are males (59%), while only 16.8% are
above 60 years of age. Interestingly, 57.5% of the cases
had mild/moderate presentation, 37% had no symptoms
at all, in contrast to 5.5% who had severe conditions
[23].  Luckily, the cases reported to date did not over-
whelm the Lebanese health system, including private
(12,749 beds, 1020 respirators) and public hospitals
(2446 beds, 165 respirators) [24].
Despite the preventive measures taken on national
levels, there has been no guidance or support or involve-
ment in emergency preparedness for hospital pharma-
cists on how to deal with such a pandemic. The Order
of Pharmacists of Lebanon has only issued minimal
guidance for pharmacists working in a community set-
ting [25]. Therefore, the main objective of this survey is
to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of hos-
pital pharmacists in Lebanon towards COVID-19 pan-
demic and explore the level of health emergency
preparedness of Lebanese hospitals in response to this
pandemic.
Methods
Study design and procedure
This was a descriptive cross-sectional observational
study based on an online anonymous survey. It was con-
ducted from March 29, 2020, through May 10, 2020.
The voluntary survey was carried out on licensed phar-
macists working in hospital pharmacies located in all
Governorates of Lebanon (Beirut, Mount Lebanon,
North, South, and Bekaa).  To minimize interview risks
as well as the lockdown restrictions enforced by the
Lebanese Government, a snowball sampling method was
used as an approach to the survey using online Google
forms [26]. The survey was distributed via social applica-
tions including WhatsApp, LinkedIn, and Facebook. All
invited participants were above 18 years of age. Licensed
pharmacists practicing in other settings or not currently
working in Lebanon were excluded from this survey.
Sample size
The sample size was determined by using Epi Info 7 Stat-
Calc functions for a population survey. Considering that
at the time of the survey, 320 licensed pharmacists were
working in hospital settings, with an expected confidence
level of 95%, a margin of error of 5%, and assuming that
90% of the hospital pharmacists were familiar with the
recommendations of the ASHP [15] that were circulated
on the hospital pharmacists group and were available on-
line, the minimal sample size was found to be 75. 
Survey development
A group of 5 pharmacists with extended experience in
hospital pharmacy and academia developed the question-
naire based on a thorough review of the literature [3, 4, 8,
18, 23, 25] and the latest recommendations of professional
organizations. The preparedness questions were adapted
from the ASHP COVID-19 pandemic assessment tool for
health-system pharmacy departments [17]. The question-
naire was piloted and reviewed by another set of 5 hospital
pharmacists. All questions were simplified for better un-
derstanding (Additional file 1). The final questionnaire re-
quired an average of 14 min to complete.
The questionnaire was developed in English language
and consisted of 78 questions using a combination of
Likert scales and multiple choice questions. It is com-
posed of the following sections: sociodemographic char-
acteristics (1–14),  knowledge (15–27),  attitude (28–34),
practice (35–57),  and pandemic planning efforts and
preparedness (58–78). It also included a free-text section
at the end where the participant could add any sugges-
tion or comment. The answers provided by the pharma-
cists were collected on an online sheet.
Data management and statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences for Windows, Version
23.0 (SPSS Inc. - IBM Corp.,  Armonk, NY, USA).  De-
scriptive statistics were calculated. Means and standard
deviations were reported for continuous variables. Cat-
egorical variables were assessed and described as fre-
quency and percentage.
Results
General characteristics of hospital pharmacists
A total of 81 hospital pharmacists were included in
the survey (mean age 39.36 years ± SD 10.48, 85.2%
females).  The highest percentage of respondents was
from Beirut. The great majority had a PharmD or
Master’s degree (80.2%), while only 19.8% had a BS in
Pharmacy (Table 1).
Knowledge related to COVID-19
Knowledge of hospital pharmacists in Lebanon was
appropriate for most simple questions (more than
90%),  particularly regarding preventive measures, con-
centration of alcohol to kill viruses, and medication
use (Table 2).
Information about COVID-19
The majority of pharmacists reported getting informa-
tion about COVID-19, mainly for 1–2 h per day (48%)
and some for less than 1 h (25%). As for sources of in-
formation, the most trusted were World Health
Organization—WHO (83%),  MOPH (74%),  and CDC

Additional matters related to MOPH hotline and other
comments
Very few pharmacists tried to reach the MOPH COVID-
19 call center (12.3%), and 69.1% reported having attended
an awareness session on COVID-19. In the last open- 
ended question, some pharmacists expressed many needs,
including information and clear recommendations.
Attitude of Lebanese hospital pharmacists towards
COVID-19
The majority of pharmacists were concerned about get-
ting infected and their families due to their professional
exposure. More than half of them declared being
exhausted because of the pandemic but claimed that
their stress did not affect their professional duties nor

their family and staff relationships, and a few employees
(29%) expressed their desire to quit their jobs. Less than
50% of pharmacies have implemented icebreaking or
energizing actions to mitigate staff stress (Table 4).
Practice of hospital pharmacists regarding safety
Two thirds of hospital pharmacists reported following
appropriate safety recommendations. As for shifts man-
agement, around half of pharmacists are still operating
as usual, with no reduction in timing and no change or
rotation when shifts overlap. Nevertheless, 8.6% of staff
were tested positive for COVID-19 till now. For those
wearing masks, they would change it after a median of 5
h; for gloves, it would be after 2.5 h. Although more than
90% declared being able to frequently wash or rub their
hands, and avoid touching their face, a lower percentage
could keep a safe distance from their work colleagues
(80%). About 22% do not stay home even if they are not
feeling well, 26% do never wear gloves, and 30% rarely
wear masks (Table 5). 
Provision of protective devices and supplements
The majority agreed that they had a shortage of
masks, gloves, and hand sanitizers. Almost all phar-
macists were facing supply delays, rising prices, and
pressure from suppliers to pay in cash, and after
short periods (Table 6).
Practice related to the hospital preparedness for COVID-
19
At the time of the survey, almost half of the hospitals
had taken practical steps in preparation for COVID-19
pandemic spreading in Lebanon; one quarter to one
third were still working on their plans, but some were
not taking any measures as institutions (Table 7).
Discussion
Pharmacists are front line responders for COVID-19 pa-
tient care [27].  In this study, the authors assessed the
knowledge, attitude, practices, and preparedness of a
representative sample of hospital pharmacists towards
COVID-19 pandemic across Lebanon. Knowledge of

hospital pharmacists regarding COVID-19 is important.
Hospital pharmacists are essential members of inter-
professional health care teams especially during out-
breaks, where they serve a vital role in infection control
and in managing the medication therapies of patients
hospitalized due to COVID-19 or related illnesses [28,
29]. Moreover, providing drug information is one of the
main professional responsibilities of all pharmacists [30].
As they are assuming their advisory role on the use of
pharmaceutical products, hospital pharmacists should
also be aware of the recommendations concerning masks
for example [31]. The majority of our study respondents
showed appropriate knowledge regarding COVID-19
methods of transmission, preventive measures, and med-
ications used. This finding is consistent with many stud-
ies that surveyed hospital pharmacists in different 
countries (Turkey, Vietnam, and Pakistan) and showed
adequate knowledge about COVID-19 [32–34].
In mid-February, the WHO announced that
COVID-19 outbreak was accompanied by an “info-
demic” defined as an overabundance of information,
making it highly prone to falsehoods and misinforma-
tion [35].  Consequently, healthcare providers should
carefully evaluate COVID-19 information sources and
utilize trustable resources to seek information [36,
37]. Most of the hospital pharmacists in our study re-
ported using trusted resources from official websites
including websites of MOPH, CDC, WHO, and Infec-
tious Diseases Society of American (IDSA).  Around
half of the pharmacists also reported using television
as a source of information. Different surveys in the
USA and UK showed that television viewing during

March and April 2020 has remarkably surpassed pre-
vious years, where public service media are viewed as
a trusted source of information on the COVID-19 cri-
sis [38–40]. Around one-third of pharmacists reported
using Facebook for COVID-19 information, which is
an unsafe practice. A new report has found that
dozens of popular Facebook pages are publishing, re-
peating, and sharing false stories about the new cor-
onavirus, related to conspiracy theories and false
cures [41].
Concerning the attitude of Lebanese hospital pharma-
cists during the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the re-
spondents reported exhaustion and concerns about 
being infected due to their professional exposure. Re-
spondents, however, claimed that their stress did not
affect their professional duties. Fear and exhaustion are
common complaints among healthcare providers across
the globe as the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a heavy
toll on them [42].
The majority of the hospital pharmacists surveyed
reported positive practices regarding safety and pro-
tective measures from COVID-19 infection, but re-
ported shortages or delays in the supply of masks,
gloves, and hand gels. The provision of personal pro-
tective equipment items and other medical devices
should be adequately ensured in hospitals as they
Page 10
Zeenny et al. Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy and Practice (2020) 13:54  Page 10 of 12
are used every day to provide adequate protection
for healthcare professionals and patients as needed
[31, 43].  The Chinese Pharmaceutical Association
compiled a list of key facilities, equipment, and per-
sonal protective equipment of COVID-19 infections,
particularly to hospital pharmacy settings [44].  As
the number of affected countries and infected pa-
tients increased, the world faced a global shortage
leading to disruption or delay of supplies [45]. In re-
sponse to these threatening shortages, CDC and
other non-official organizations recommended several
strategies to optimize the supply and use of these
equipment items and devices [43, 45, 46].  It is to
note that the shortages in Lebanon were exacerbated
by the harsh financial crisis and dollar shortage the
country has been facing even before the COVID-19
pandemic [47, 48].
Along the same line, the WHO and the CDC have
developed preparedness tools and checklists to en-
hance the readiness of healthcare professionals and
facilities responding to COVID-19 [49, 50]. More spe-
cifically, the American Society of Health-System Phar-
macists (ASHP) and the International Pharmaceutical
Federation (FIP) has issued guides for health-system
pharmacy departments and the pharmacy workforce
respectively, to assist in planning efforts of the phar-
macy department and to foster pharmacist involve-
ment at the institutional and community levels in the
fight of COVID-19 [17, 31].  These guides mainly fo-
cused on the role of the hospital pharmacist in ensur-
ing adequate stock of medications and supplies,
planning proper staffing needs, and providing ad-
equate professional education and training. In this
study, we surveyed participants between March 29
and May 10, 2020, 2 weeks to 2 months after the
WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak a global pan-
demic [51].  Around two thirds of the surveyed phar-
macists reported taking practical steps in their
departments in preparation for COVID-19 pandemic
or progressively working on their plans. Around 30%
of the respondents, however, reported not taking any
measures. The lowest preparedness (around 55%) was
reported for the designation of a pharmacy staff
member to coordinate education and training on
COVID-19. The unpreparedness of some hospitals
could be attributed to the previously mentioned fi-
nancial crisis in the country, which made it harder
for Lebanese hospitals to cope [47, 48].  Another po-
tential reason is the fact that the local COVID-19
health strategic preparedness and response plan devel-
oped by the Lebanese MOPH did not include detailed
measures or preparedness plans for pharmacy depart-
ments. It rather mentioned the importance of ensur-
ing healthcare service continuity through maintaining 
adequate supplies of pharmaceuticals and medical de-
vices [52].
At the time the investigators started this study, the
number of infected people in the country was around
400 [23]. It was around a week after the country’s prime
minister declared a state of a medical emergency and an-
nounced the closure of the airport, seaports, and land
entrances. As of June 1, the number of COVID-19 pa-
tients in the country reached around 1233 cases (around
180 cases per 1 million of the population) [2].  This
makes Lebanon among the countries that successfully
flattened the curve, as the numbers were much lower
than previously projected [53, 54]. Currently, Lebanon is
preparing for a gradual exit from the lockdown [55].
This is happening amidst fears from a second wave, as
the numbers of infected people per day are increasing
again [23].  This requires continuous readiness for the
healthcare system.
To our knowledge, this is the first study that has
assessed the knowledge, attitude, practice, and pre-
paredness of hospital pharmacists regarding COVID-
19 in Lebanon. Potential limitations include the rela-
tively small sample size. In addition, as the survey
was in English language, Arabic/French speaking
pharmacists may have refrained from filling it due to
language barrier. This may have contributed to the
relatively small sample size. Concerning the sample
representability, the distribution of hospital pharma-
cists in Lebanon per geographical area is as follows:
Bekaa (10.6%),  South (13.4%),  North (12%),  Beirut
(35.3%),  and Mount Lebanon (28.6%).  Therefore, we
can conclude relatively lower representability of hos-
pitals from the south area (a remote region from the
capital),  suggesting a probable overestimation of the
results we obtained. Finally, there is a possibility of
information bias, as surveys were self-administered
and some pharmacists may have understood some
questions differently. Further studies are suggested to
take into account these weaknesses; nevertheless, we
have no reason to believe that this would change the
main results we obtained.
Conclusion
Our findings revealed an appropriate level of knowledge
and good practices towards COVID-19 among respon-
dents from Lebanese hospital pharmacists. However,
hospital pharmacists have not been engaged by the min-
istry of public health in the health emergency plans. This
translated on delaying hospitals preparedness as a whole.
National officials and organizations may benefit in utiliz-
ing the expertise of the hospital pharmacists to be able
to minimize/avoid future waves of COVID-19 and miti-
gate the risk if these waves emerge.
