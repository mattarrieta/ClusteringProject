Abstract 
Over the last year, the dangerous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly
around the world. Malaysia has not been excluded from this COVID-19 pandemic. The resurgence of COVID-19 cases
has overwhelmed the public healthcare system and overloaded the healthcare resources. Ministry of Health (MOH) 
Malaysia has adopted an Emergency Ordinance (EO) to instruct private hospitals to receive both COVID-19 and non-
COVID-19 patients to reduce the strain on public facilities. The treatment of COVID-19 patients at private hospitals
could help to boost the bed and critical care occupancy. However, with the absence of insurance coverage because
COVID-19 is categorised as pandemic-related diseases, there are some challenges and opportunities posed by the
treatment fees management. Another major issue in the collaboration between public and private hospitals is the
willingness of private medical consultants to participate in the management of COVID-19 patients, because medi-
cal consultants in private hospitals in Malaysia are not hospital employees, but what are termed “private contractors” 
who provide patient care services to the hospitals. Other collaborative measures with private healthcare providers, 
e.g. tele-conferencing by private medical clinics to monitor COVID-19 patients and the rollout of national vaccination
programme. The public and private healthcare partnership must be enhanced, and continue to find effective ways to
collaborate further to combat the pandemic. The MOH, private healthcare sectors and insurance providers need to
have a synergistic COVID-19 treatment plans to ensure public as well as insurance policy holders have equal opportu-
nities for COVID-19 screening tests, vaccinations and treatment.

Background
Over the last year, the dangerous severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rap-
idly around the world. Malaysia has not been excluded
from this COVID-19 pandemic. This has had a detrimen-
tal effect on the economy and health system of the coun-
try, which has a population of 32 million people [1]. The
newly reported COVID-19 daily cases skyrocketed from
less than 100 cases in September 2020 to more than 5000
in January 2021 with a case fatality rate of 0.34% [1]. In 
the meantime, according to a report in the World Bank
in December 2020, Malaysia’s economy is projected to
contract by 5.8% in 2020 due to a sharp slowdown in eco-
nomic activity caused by the COVID-19 and measures to
contain its spread. Like many other countries, Malaysia is
facing an unprecedented dual crisis. Currently, Malaysia
is experiencing a second stringent nationwide lockdown
(called a movement control order, MCO), following the
first national lockdown in March 2020.

Ministry of Health hospitals overwhelmed
by the current resurgence of COVID‑19 cases
An elevated number of vulnerable COVID-19 patients has
put heavy pressure on public healthcare facilities in Malay-
sia. Currently the Malaysia healthcare service is delivered
through two healthcare systems, which are the public and
private systems. The public healthcare system is the main
healthcare provider in the country, and the Ministry of
Health (MOH) is the main national regulatory and policy-
maker [2]. For financing, the public healthcare system is
mainly supported by taxation and some other revenues. 
The private healthcare sector is underpinned by private
healthcare insurance funds, patients’ out-of-pocket expen-
ditures, and private and non-profit institutions [2].
A state of emergency was declared on 12 January 2021 by
the Malaysian government to push for stricter control and
drastic measures to better prepare for this critical nation-
wide disaster. Prior to the sudden spike of COVID-19
cases, all the COVID-19 patients were sent to public hos-
pitals for treatment and isolation. However, the continuous
increase in COVID-19 cases has overwhelmed the public
healthcare system and overloaded the healthcare resources. 
In particular, ICU beds for COVID-19 patients at some
major hospitals in the capital cities have reached maximum
capacity.
Synergy with private hospitals to treat COVID‑19
patients
In terms of the cost of COVID-19 treatment to be borne by
the patient, the fees at public facilities are currently afforda-
ble. The charges are similar to those for other non-commu-
nicable diseases as stipulated by the Federal Government
Gazette: Order 2014—Medical Fees and Cost of Services
[3]. However, due to the sudden increase in number of
COVID-19 cases and almost full capacity of public hos-
pitals, the government has had to reach out to the private
sector to collaborate in the management of the pandemic.
Through the Prevention and Control of Infectious Dis-
eases Act 1988, MOH Malaysia has adopted an Emergency
Ordinance (EO) to instruct private hospitals to receive
COVID-19 patients [4]. A fine of up to USD 1.23 million
or jail time could be imposed if private hospitals refuse to
receive category 1 and 2 COVID-19 patients under the EO
[5]. At present, there are 210 private hospitals in Malaysia. 
The MOH has identified 130 private hospitals equipped
with internal medicine specialties, and 95 hospitals are col-
laborating with the MOH to receive COVID-19 patients
[6]. At a glance, a total of 1286 normal beds, 65 intensive
care unit (ICU) beds and 54 ventilators could be leveraged
throughout collaboration with private hospitals [6]. In line
with the EO, the Malaysia government has allocated USD
24.7 million to private hospitals for the treatment of both 
COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients to reduce the
strain on public facilities [7].
The potential resources for management
of COVID‑19 and non‑COVID‑19 illnesses in private
hospitals
There are huge resources in the private sector that can
be potentially used in collaboration with the public sec-
tor. Taking into the consideration that the treatment cost
at a private hospital is a fully out-of-pocket expense as
well as the almost full capacity of public hospital beds, 
discussion has been initiated between the MOH and the
Association of Private Hospitals of Malaysia (APHM) 
on the areas of collaboration and the policy of COVID-
19 patients treated at private hospitals. During the pan-
demic, with the travel restrictions, the bed occupancy
rate in private hospitals has been very low, and facili-
ties underutilised. Private hospitals have been severely
affected by the travel restrictions because they normally
cater to medical tourists, including general treatment, 
surgeries, and oncology treatment. The treatment of
COVID-19 patients at private hospitals could help to
boost the bed and critical care occupancy. For example, 
KPJ Healthcare Bhd, one of the largest private hospital
groups in Malaysia, immediately took heed of the govern-
ment’s instruction and started receiving both COVID-
19 and non-COVID-19 patients from public facilities in
January 2021 [8]. Not only are the private hospitals treat-
ing COVID-19 patients, but non-COVID-19 patients can
also be channelled to them, to ease the burden on public
hospitals.
Challenges and opportunities: collaboration
between public and private hospitals
One of the major issues in the collaboration for the treat-
ment of COVID-19 patients between public and private
hospitals is the difference in the treatment fees. While
the fees for public hospitals are very low as they are
greatly subsidised by the government, private hospitals
charge full fees, which can be as much as 10 times higher. 
Hence, APHM has urged insurance companies to revise
their insurance policy to extend coverage of COVID-19
patients at private hospitals [9]. In response to this issue, 
the government should aid in reducing the operational
cost from the private hospitals, in particular the expenses
related to the management for COVID-19, such as test-
ing, personal protective equipment and treatment, which
have become the major hindrance to COVID-19 care
in private hospitals. Similarly, government can set up
a COVID-19 emergency fund, or work with insurance
companies with the aim to relieve these financial burdens
from the private hospitals.

One other major issue in the collaboration between
public and private hospitals is the willingness of private
medical consultants to participate in the management of
COVID-19 patients, especially if the patients are from
public hospitals. Medical consultants in private hospi-
tals in Malaysia are not hospital employees, but what are
termed “private contractors” who provide patient care
services to the hospitals. Refusal of private medical con-
sultants to participate is detrimental to the collaboration. 
Therefore, early engagement with the medical consult-
ants is of paramount importance to increase their will-
ingness to participate. To facilitate this, safety measures
must be in place. In addition, equipment and drugs sup-
ply should be adequate, especially when the number of
cases becomes overwhelming. This can be a key assur-
ance for the healthcare professionals to work smoothly. 
On the other hand, difficult decisions have to be made
about the allocation of the limited healthcare supplies
between COVID-19-specific requirements and other
health facilities, which includes, for example, not to sup-
port non-urgent treatments in the private hospitals. 
Finally, it is critical for medical professionals to under-
stand that, without collective efforts between both pub-
lic and private health sectors, the country’s public health
and economy will be at fatal risk for an unforeseeable
longer period.
Other collaborative measures with private
healthcare providers
The bed allocation for COVID-19 treatment at pub-
lic and private facilities in Malaysia is 28,674 and 1286
beds, respectively [7]. This is a stark contrast compared
to 45,478 COVID-19 patients currently under treat-
ment (as of 29th January 2021). With a knee-jerk policy
reaction, the Malaysian government has taken proactive
measures to set up a warehouse or stadium as a COVID-
19 Quarantine and Low-Risk Treatment Centre to cater
for mild cases or asymptomatic COVID-19 patients [10].
The latest measure is to allow people with mild COVID-
19 cases to self-isolate at home, especially if they have no
symptoms [11]. The Malaysia Medical Association, which
represents the medical fraternity, states that private med-
ical clinics can help to monitor and care for COVID-19
patients by doing tele-conferencing and alleviate these
patients’ fears.
Vaccination is one gigantic agenda in the pipeline. The
first batch of vaccines was scheduled to arrive in Malaysia
in February 2021 [12]. The Malaysian government pro-
vides free vaccination to the country’s citizens in stages. 
The effective rollout of a COVID-19 vaccination pro-
gramme on a national scale calls for the involvement of
community pharmacists to provide immunisation. In the
last decade, community pharmacists in various countries 
have achieved much success in terms of safe and con-
venient vaccinations. Although a pharmacist-provided
immunisation programme is not something new, this will
be the maiden effort to have more than 2889 community
pharmacies [13] in Malaysia administer the vaccine to
the general public, and achieve the programme’s target
of 75,000 daily injections [14]. Looking at the urgency of
vaccinating older people in a timely manner and the need
for a bolster dose within the recommended time frame, 
the existing 200-plus private hospitals should be roped in
to expedite the vaccination rate.
Conclusion
COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the existing and
diverse nature of weaknesses of health systems across
the world. Malaysia, like many other ASEAN countries, 
needs to strengthen its healthcare system, particularly
to mitigate the COVID-19 cases in the country. Hence, 
the public and private healthcare partnership must be
enhanced, and continue to find effective ways to collabo-
rate further to combat the pandemic. The MOH, private
healthcare sectors and insurance providers need to have
a synergistic COVID-19 treatment plans to ensure pub-
lic as well as insurance policy holders have equal oppor-
tunities for COVID-19 screening tests, vaccinations and
treatment. Such plans would ensure smooth and efficient
management of patients at both public and private hospi-
tals. More importantly, the country will benefit from pre-
paring such plan as a guide in event of a future disaster or
pandemic.
As social distancing, mask-wearing, handwashing, and
quarantining have all helped decrease the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic and will likely influence health-
care for the foreseeable future, the government should
continue educating the public about COVID-19 to
strengthen the public awareness about the precautionary
measures and finally control the spread of COVID-19.
