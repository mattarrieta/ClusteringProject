COMMENTA RY  Open Access
CoViD vaccines and thrombotic events: 
EMA issued warning to patients and healthcare
professionals
Hamid A. Merchant* 
There have been recent reports of haemorrhage, blood
clots and thrombocytopenia following administration of
CoViD-19 vaccines that have raised concerns over the
safety of genetic vaccines for people with pre-existing
coagulation disorders or those on certain medications. 
This had also led to temporary suspension of Oxford/AZ
CoViD vaccine in a number of countries across Europe
[1].  As a result, Medicine and Healthcare Regulatory
Authority, UK (MHRA) and European Medicines Agency
(EMA) initiated a rigorous scientific review of pharma-
covigilance data and available evidence to assess the
potential association of the vaccine to recent thrombotic
events.
MHRA confirmed on 18th March 2021 that the ‘evi-
dence does not suggest that blood clots are caused by
COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca and assured that the
benefits of the vaccine in preventing COVID-19 far out-
weigh the thrombotic risks and people should continue
taking the vaccine when offered [2].
Medicine and Healthcare Regulatory Authority
(MHRA) further stated that sinus vein thrombosis along
with thrombocytopenia has been reported in less than
one in a million people vaccinated so far in the UK, it
can occur naturally and that a causal association with
the vaccine could not be established. However, they will
continue to monitor the situation, and as a precaution-
ary measure advised that anyone with a headache lasting

of Huddersfield, Queensgate, Huddersfield HD1 3DH, United Kingdom 
more than 4 days after vaccination, or bruising beyond
the site of vaccination, should seek medical attention.
EMA on the other hand also investigated the events
and concluded on 18th March 2021 that the ‘vaccine may
be associated with very rare cases of blood clots associ-
ated with thrombocytopenia with or without bleeding, 
including rare cases of clots in the vessels draining blood
from the brain’ [3]. EMA stated that a causal link with the
vaccine is ‘not proven but possible’ and deserves further
analysis. They, however, also reassured that the benefits
of having a CoViD vaccine still outweigh the risks despite
a possible link to the rare blood clots with low blood
platelets. They also assured a continued monitoring of
the situation and further review of thrombotic risk with
other CoViD vaccines.
EMA has also taken additional measures to include
information on thrombotic risks in the vaccine’s sum-
mary of product characteristics (SmPC) and product
information leaflets. Furthermore, EMA issued warnings
to the patients and healthcare professionals to be vigi-
lant. EMA also published an extended list of symptoms
which, if found persistent beyond 3 days of vaccination, 
patients should seek a prompt medical assistance. The list
of symptoms included breathlessness, pain in the chest or
stomach, swelling or coldness in an arm or leg, severe or
worsening headache or blurred vision, persistent bleed-
ing, multiple small bruises, reddish or purplish spots, or
blood blisters under the skin. EMA urged the healthcare
professionals to be alert for potential risk of thromboem-
bolism in vaccinated individuals.
There are reports of antibodies present in CoViD-19
patients that activated platelets [4] and patients with

thrombocytopenia following CoViD vaccination showed
a favourable response to immune thrombocytopenia-
directed therapies (corticosteroids and IVIG) [5].  We
proposed a likely mechanism on 15th March 2020 that
the genetic CoViD-19 vaccines may directly infect plate-
lets and megakaryocytes triggering mRNA translation
and consequent spike protein synthesis intracellularly. 
This may potentially result in an autoimmune response
against platelets and megakaryocytes resulting in reticu-
loendothelial phagocytosis and direct CD8+ T cell lysis
[6].  The consequent thrombocytopaenia may lead to
internal bleeding and spontaneous blood clots. On 19th
March 2020, scientists from Oslo identified an antibody
from vaccinated individuals which they suspect being
responsible for attacking platelets and causing recent
thrombotic events [7]. This discovery also supports our
hypothesis [6] that CoViD genetic vaccines may have
a direct role in spurring autoimmune response against
platelets that may clinically manifest in thrombocytope-
nia, haemorrhage, and blood clots.
Vaccines are one of the great discoveries in medicine
that has improved life expectancy dramatically. Nonethe-
less, genetic vaccines are new, and their long-term safety
evaluation is a key to identify potentially contraindicated
group of subjects, for instance, patients with history of
blood disorders, past or current thrombocytopenia or
pre-existing immunological conditions.
Pharmacovigilance can play a key role in early detection
of potentially severe adverse events. The recent experi-
ence with Pandemrix raised fundamental questions on
the regulatory approach to pharmacovigilance. It reminds
us of the duty of the public health agencies to warn the
public over possible harms of vaccines, the level of details
that public should be made aware of, who should pro-
vide the information to public, and whether the provi-
sion of such information be proactive or passive [8]. The
early signs of rare side effects during pharmacovigilance
that may lead to severe adverse outcomes should never
be dismissed just on the basis of prevalence statistics, 
but require thorough scientific investigations and clini-
cal correlation to rule out a potential causal link. We, 
therefore, welcome EMA’s stance on issuing a caution to
the public and physicians and support their decision of
continued monitoring of thrombotic events more closely
with necessary scientific investigations.
