Abstract 
Background:  The declaration of COVID-19 a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020 marked
the beginning of a global health crisis of an unprecedented nature and scale. The approach taken by countries across
the world varied widely, however, the delivery of frontline healthcare was consistently recognised as being central to
the pandemic response. This study aimed to identify and explore the issues currently facing pharmacy teams across
Commonwealth countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also evaluates pharmacy professionals’ under‑
standing of key knowledge areas from the COVID-19 webinar hosted by the Commonwealth Pharmacists’ Association
(CPA).
Method:  A quantitative survey-based approach was adopted, using a 32-item questionnaire developed from the
literature on pharmacy and pandemic response. The survey was hosted on Survey Monkey and pilot tested. The
final survey was disseminated by CPA member organisations. A 6-item online questionnaire was sent via email to all
attendees of CPA’s COVID-19 webinar. Descriptive statistics on frequency distributions and percentages were used to
analyse the responses. Data were analysed using ­Microsoft® Excel (2010).
Results:  There were 545 responses from pharmacy professionals across 31/54 Commonwealth countries in Africa, 
Asia, the Americas, Europe and the Pacific. Majority of the respondents reported being at least somewhat worried
(90%) and more than 65% were very worried or extremely about the impact of COVID-19 on them personally and
professionally. Nearly two-thirds of respondents stated finding it somewhat difficult or very difficult to work effec‑
tively during the pandemic. Challenges mostly faced by pharmacy professionals working remotely included; general
anxiety about the impact of COVID-19 on their lives (12%), and difficulties in communicating with their co-workers
(12%). Most pharmacy professionals had not previously been actively involved in a global health emergency (82%)
nor obtained training on global/public health emergency preparedness (62%). Between 45 and 97% of the COVID-
19 webinar attendees provided the correct answers to post-webinar questions, suggesting some improvement in
knowledge.
Conclusion:  Our study confirms pharmacy professionals’ concerns about practice during a pandemic and provides
preliminary data on the challenges and learning needs of the profession. The CPA has since acted on these find‑
ings, providing ongoing opportunities to develop and refine resources for the profession as the pandemic evolves.

Background
COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health
Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020, marking the
beginning of a global health crisis of an unprecedented
nature and scale [1]. The response to the pandemic by
countries across the world varied widely, with differences
in the type of strategy and timing of steps employed. 
Regardless of the approach taken, the delivery of front-
line healthcare was consistently recognised as being cen-
tral to the pandemic response [2]. There were significant
changes in healthcare delivery as a result of lockdown
restrictions, such as travel and social distancing restric-
tions, and reductions in workforce capacity and/or work-
ing hours [3]. With the increased pressure on the health
system, pharmacists were called upon as key members
of the healthcare team to support and alleviate the bur-
den on overcrowded emergency departments and free up
medical staff to treat more unwell patients [4]. In many
countries, at a national level, pharmacies were defined
as essential services, and were one of the few services
that remained opened and accessible to the public when
countries were placed in lockdown with recommenda-
tions in some countries for pharmacies to stay open
7 days a week and during usual holidays to manage the
COVID-19 pandemic [5, 6].
Pharmacy teams are critical members of the healthcare
workforce and are considered essential frontline health-
care workers. The pharmacy workforce provides a wide
range of healthcare services in community pharmacies; 
healthcare hubs designed to meet health needs in com-
munities [7, 8]. As healthcare professionals, they were
strategically positioned help manage the COVID-19 pan-
demic and strengthen a country’s pandemic response and
readiness through their roles in the community. Phar-
macists are also easy to access healthcare professionals
and community pharmacies are more widely distributed
in some countries than supermarkets, banks and medi-
cal centres [4].  Pharmacies are also familiar places to
the community, and most community pharmacists and
pharmacy team members have established relationships
with the public and with primary care providers and are
therefore ideally positioned to support other healthcare
providers in the pandemic response. The dual role of
pharmacists as healthcare providers and retailers [9] also
brings opportunities for flexibility in healthcare service
delivery models during health crises. Pharmacists can 
dispense medicines and ration supplies, administer vacci-
nations, but also supply consumables and health-related
products [8, 9].
A strong evidence base exists showing that pharmacists
are in a prime position to support a pandemic response
[10],  yet their skill sets are often not recognised and
underutilised [4]. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the
support available in each country for pharmacy teams
have varied widely with pharmacists receiving differ-
ing levels of guidance on how to manage COVID-19 and
how to adequately prepare their pharmacy teams as part
of the pandemic response, particularly as “gatekeepers
with no safety” [11]. Pharmacists in the UK and Pakistan
collaborated to compile guidelines for pharmacy teams
in English and Urdu in an attempt to assist the response
[12]. In some countries such as New Zealand and North-
ern Ireland, the government has acknowledged phar-
macists’ contribution during the pandemic by providing
extra remuneration [12, 13]. The New Zealand Ministry
of Health also produced useful resources for pharmacists
including posters on infection prevention, information
sheets to educate the general public about COVID-19, 
and educative social media images [14].
The Commonwealth Pharmacists Association (CPA) 
has been uniting and supporting the pharmacy workforce
throughout the Commonwealth during these challeng-
ing times. The Commonwealth is a voluntary associa-
tion consisting of 54 independent and equal countries
spanning every continent. It is home to 2.4 billion peo-
ple; approximately a third of the world’s population and
includes both advanced economies and a high propor-
tion of lower-resourced countries, including many island
nations. Member governments share goals such as devel-
opment, democracy and peace [15]. The CPA is a regis-
tered charity whose vision is to “empower pharmacists to
improve health and wellbeing throughout the Common-
wealth”. Its mission is focused on facilitating better access
to medicines and improving the quality of, and safer and
more effective use of medicines in the Commonwealth, 
particularly in lower-middle income countries (LMICs).
The CPA achieves this through building strong collabo-
rative networks; partnering with member organisations
to improve the quality of pharmacy practice; and creat-
ing platforms for the dissemination of knowledge about
pharmaceutical sciences and professional practice. The
Commonwealth and the CPA are therefore well-placed
Page 3
Ashiru‑Oredope   et al. J of Pharm Policy and Pract (2020) 13:72  Page 3 of 11
to play a pivotal role in the pandemic response [16]. As
a globally focused civil society organisation, it is critical
that the CPA responds to actual rather than perceived
needs. However, there is limited data currently available
to describe the issues affecting the ability of the phar-
macy profession to optimally respond to the pandemic, 
and the gaps that exist in information provision.
In this context, this study was planned to identify and
explore the issues that pharmacy teams across Common-
wealth countries faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, 
specifically:
•  To evaluate how concerned pharmacy staff are about
COVID-19 and their ability to work effectively dur-
ing the COVID-19 pandemic;
• To explore what work has been done by pharmacy
professionals and/or professional bodies as part of
the current pandemic response;
• To analyse what support would be helpful to receive
to better equip the profession to respond to the pan-
demic.
• To measure the impact of COVID-19 webinars on
participant’s knowledge of COVID-19 as well as
resources available for pharmacy professionals across
the commonwealth.
Methods
Survey development
A quantitative survey-based approach was adopted using
a 32-item questionnaire developed from the literature
on pharmacy and pandemic response. This question-
naire was not validated for reliability and validity as the
questionnaire needed to be responsive to the evolving
pandemic in a timely manner, however questions were
informed by current literature on pharmaceutical and
pandemic responses. All questions were presented to
respondents in English language. Most questions were in
Likert-scale response format, with categorical responses
ranging from ‘extremely’ to ‘not at all’, depending on the
focus of the question. In some questions, respondents
were invited to select more than one option from a list
of possible responses, for example, to identify the chal-
lenges that pharmacy professionals were facing during
the pandemic, respondents were shown a list of chal-
lenges from which they could select their top three chal-
lenges (see Additional file 2 for the full questionnaire).
Demographic data were also collected from respond-
ents, including information on age, gender, country, 
number of years of practice in their current profession, 
and predominant work setting. The survey was reviewed
and refined by discussing with a working group com-
prising members from the CPA COVID-19 action team 
with expertise covering pharmacy, infection manage-
ment, health psychology, global health, and healthcare
communications.
The survey was then hosted on Survey Monkey (sur-
veymonkey.com, USA),  a web-based survey platform, 
then pilot tested with eight individuals across UK, 
Uganda and New Zealand. Following this initial test-
ing, the final survey was disseminated by CPA member
organisations (national pharmacy organisations) via the
CPA members list and associated networks. The sur-
vey was also promoted via CPA social media platforms, 
including LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook, and the CPA
newsletter and website ([URL: "https://thecommonwealth.org/about-us"] https​://theco​mmonw​ealth​.org/
 about​-us).
Further details on the methodology including the pro-
cess for development and pre-testing are provided in
Additional file 1 which completes the CHERRIES check-
list for web-based studies [17]. The survey questionnaire
is also provided as Additional file 2.
CPA COVID‑19 webinar
The CPA hosted its first webinar on COVID-19 on 7 May
2020. The aim of the webinar was to find out how phar-
macy teams across the Commonwealth had been cop-
ing with the pandemic as well as provide information
on COVID-19 resources available for pharmacy profes-
sionals. As part of the evaluation of the webinar, a 6-item
online questionnaire was designed and sent to webinar
attendees. The questions comprised of three multiple-
choice questions and three close-ended statements/
questions to assess key knowledge areas (e.g. treatments
for COVID-19) that were discussed in the webinar. A
question in a Likert-scale format was designed to assess
attendee’s satisfaction with the webinar. The survey was
then sent to webinar attendees via email.
Respondent eligibility
CPA COVID‑19 survey
Pharmacy professionals (pharmacists, pharmacy tech-
nicians and dispensers) across the 54 Commonwealth

Data management
Data were collected anonymously, although survey
respondents could voluntarily provide their name and
email address should they wish to be contacted follow-
ing the survey with information related to the survey or
other COVID-19-related information. The data were held
securely and in-line with the General Data Protection
Regulation 2016/679 [18].
Approval to carry out the study was obtained by the
CPA board of trustees. Ethical approval was not required
because this is a service evaluation. All respondents par-
ticipated strictly in their professional capacity, and gave
informed consent to participate in the survey.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics on the frequency distributions and
percentages were used to analyse the responses. Data
were analysed using ­Microsoft® Excel (2010).
Results
Demographics of respondents
Overall, there were 545 responses from pharmacy profes-
sionals (486 pharmacists and 59 pharmacy technicians) 
across 37 countries; 31 of which are Commonwealth
countries (Table 1). Additionally, there were responses
from 111 pharmacy students from 7 countries. India (76),
Tanzania (27), Bangladesh (2), Uganda (2), Zambia (2),
Pakistan (1) and the UK (1). Over half of the respondents
were in the age range of 25–44 years, with the majority
having less than 10 years of experience. Most respond-
ents (71%) also worked in either a hospital or in a com-
munity setting.
Survey findings
Level of concern about COVID‑19 and ability to work
effectively during the pandemic
Figure 1 illustrates the level of worry from respond-
ents about the impact of COVID-19 on them personally
and the pharmacy profession. More than 90% of people
reported at least being somewhat worried, with nearly
two-thirds reporting being ‘very worried’ or ‘extremely
worried’. Extreme worry was observed to be higher on a
personal level than on a professional level.
Impact on effective working and need for remote working
Nearly two-thirds of respondents stated finding it some-
what difficult or very difficult to work effectively during
the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 2 illustrates the per-
centage breakdown of respondents who have needed
to work remotely, by work setting. This shows that
respondents working in academia, professional bodies 
and industry are more likely to work remotely compared
to those in government and patient-facing roles such as
community and hospital.
Key challenges with remote working
The most common challenges that pharmacy profession-
als selected with remote working (Table 2) were: general
anxiety about the impact of coronavirus on their life, 
and difficulties with communication with their co-work-
ers (each selected by 12% of respondents), issues with
internet connectivity, social isolation, keeping a regular
schedule, no access to tools or information needed to
work at home, and issues with physical work space (each
selected by 11% respondents). Challenges that were least
faced were childcare (4.5%), getting enough food (1.8%)
and being sick, or helping the sick (1.4%).
Impact of social distancing on work
There was a mixed response on the impact of social
distancing on the pharmacy profession with 28% of
respondents stating it had significantly increased work-
load and visits to the pharmacy, yet a similar propor-
tion (28.9) reported a reduced workload and visits to the
pharmacy (Table 3).
Work done by pharmacy professional and/or professional
bodies in response to the pandemic
Majority of the respondents (n = 479) were aware
of pharmacy organisation or a pharmacist who was
involved/consulted in COVID-19 response or prepara-
tion directly (40%) or indirectly (30%). In contrast, 16% 
stated that they were not aware of any pharmacists or
pharmacy organisation being involved/consulted in
COVID-19 response; 13% did not know and 1% selected
other for contributions, e.g. developing new workflow
for medication extension, home delivery, managing ade-
quacy of drug supplies due to global supply chain disrup-
tion and supporting/implementing tele-counselling.
More than a third of respondents (40%) stated that one
or more COVID-19 responses had been spearheaded or
proposed by pharmacy organisations in their country, a
third were unsure (31%), 23% stated no responses had
been spearheaded by pharmacy organisations and 6% 
selected sort of.
Most pharmacy professionals had not previously been
actively involved in a global health emergency (82%) nor
had training on emergency preparedness global/public
health emergency preparedness (62%) (Fig. 3).

COVID‑19 webinar
The first webinar on COVID-19 was organised by the
CPA and held on 7 May 2020. It was an opportunity
to discuss resources already available to support the
COVID-19 response throughout the Commonwealth. 
Easy access to these resources collated from the WHO, 
International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP),  Africa
Centres for Disease Control (Africa CDC), Ministries
of Health, and national pharmacy associations was
provided through the Commonwealth Partnerships for
Antimicrobial Stewardship Smartphone app (CwPAMS
App). Future webinars are planned to provide a discus-
sion forum and an opportunity to share learning based
on experiences. This will be particularly important
when testing, vaccination and treatment options are
rolled out.
The webinar had 620 registrations from 38 countries. 
Top five registrations were from Nigeria (20%), Kenya
(17%), Malaysia (11%), India (8%) and Pakistan (7%). A
post-webinar feedback questionnaire was completed by
264 individuals; 71% were pharmacists and 19% phar-
macy students. 75% watched the live session while 23% 
watched the recording. Majority of the respondents

found the webinar very useful (64%) and useful (29%)
(n = 259).
The feedback also included six knowledge quizzes
(Table 5). One of which was on organisations that have
developed international recommendations/guidelines on
COVID-19. Responses revealed that 97%, 53% and 45% 
correctly identified that WHO, FIP and Africa CDC have
developed international recommendations/guidelines
on COVID-19. 24% of respondents correctly answered
the question onrelevant COVID-19 resources that
have been developed or in development as part of the
CwPAMS with ‘hand rub formulation training video’ and
‘app’ selected by 78% and 73% of respondents, respec-
tively. In addition, some respondents incorrectly selected
‘COVID-19 Treatment guidelines’ (59%),  ‘COVID-19
treatment’ (0.4%) and ‘hand rub formulation’ (0.4%). A
total of 49% respondents correctly answered the question
on the spread of COVID-19 identifying that COVID-19
is spread by droplets (96%) and surfaces (82%) while 34% 
incorrectly selected that the coronavirus is airborne.
Discussion
This is one of the first evaluations of the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on the global pharmacy profession
and its ability to work effectively, and to identify what
resources are needed to better support the profession.

The study found high levels of worry amongst almost all
respondents both on a professional and personal level
with extreme worry observed to be higher on a personal
level than on a professional level.
This correlates with a very recent study on the psy-
chological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health
care workers in a MERS-CoV endemic country which
revealed that based on the 1–5 worry rating scale, health-
care staff were more anxious about personal implications
of COVID-19 such as the transmission of the disease to a
family member rather than acquiring the infection them-
selves [19].
Most respondents reported facing some difficulty with
working effectively, with nearly half having to adjust
to remote working, particularly those working in non-
patient-facing roles such as in industry or academia. 
Major difficulties stated by respondents such as anxiety, 
communication and physical workspace were common to
pharmacy professionals worldwide. However, from previ-
ous studies, specific challenges such as poor internet con-
nectivity which could significantly affect access to tools
or information needed to work at home are frequently
associated with LMICs which constitute a significant
part of the Commonwealth [18]. The impact on workload
from social distancing was mixed with 28% of respond-
ents stating it had significantly increased workload and
visits to the pharmacy, yet a similar proportion reported
a reduced workload and visits to the pharmacy. This can
be explained by uncertainties associated with the pan-
demic. At the early stages of the pandemic, there was a
major upsurge in workload initially when there was much
uncertainty among populations regarding access to their
medicines followed by a reduction when supplies were
secured. This was however reassuring as most respond-
ents were able to identify some level of involvement of
pharmacy as part of a COVID-19 response. These find-
ings are in line with the literature available on the role of
pharmacy in managing health crises, which highlight the 
key benefits of partnerships between the pharmacy sector
and government bodies in ensuring an optimal pandemic
response [20–25]. A recent publication on Global Con-
tributions of Pharmacists across eight countries namely; 
the United States of America, United Kingdom, Canada, 
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, South Africa, Lebanon and Nigeria
during COVID-19 pandemic also highlights essential ser-
vices offered by pharmacists within and outside of core
their roles during the pandemic [26].
In terms of the needs assessment, most pharmacy pro-
fessionals had not previously been actively involved in a
global health emergency and did not have previous train-
ing on emergency preparedness. Respondents identified
a need to up skill to better respond to the pandemic; they
felt this would be best achieved through webinars on
COVID-19, access to a community of support to share
questions and concerns and being signposted to infor-
mation among other suggestions. This resonates with
a recent survey in India where pharmacy professionals
expressed willingness to be trained and better equipped
for COVID-19 and other health emergencies which could
occur in the near future [20]. Based on these findings, 
the CPA rapidly developed a number of activities to sup-
port pharmacy professionals across the Commonwealth. 
These included:
COVID‑19 webinars
The webinar on 7 May 2020 was an opportunity to dis-
cuss resources already available to support the COVID-
19 response throughout the Commonwealth [27].
Responses to key knowledge questions on COVID-
19 revealed that the webinar significantly improved
attendee’s knowledge on COVID-19 resources avail-
able for pharmacy teams, latest updates in the treat-
ment of COVID-19 and the contents of the CwPAMS
App. However, a higher percentage of respondents pro-
vided correct answers to close-ended questions than
multiple-choice questions. This can be clearly explained
Page 9
Ashiru‑Oredope   et al. J of Pharm Policy and Pract (2020) 13:72  Page 9 of 11
by the multiple-choice question format as respondents
were required to select all right options to be consid-
ered correct as opposed to close-ended questions which
required the selection of only one option. Notably, there
were varying responses to the question on the spread of
COVID-19 as research is ongoing in this area. In a recent
briefing from WHO, it was stated that the possibility of
airborne transmission of the coronavirus in public set-
tings, especially closed, poorly ventilated settings cannot
be ruled out and emphasised WHO’s commitment in the
provision of credible and accurate information concern-
ing COVID-19 [28]. The CPA has planned future webi-
nars to provide a discussion forum and an opportunity to
share learning based on experiences. This will be particu-
larly important when testing, vaccination and treatment
options are rolled out.
Future webinars planned include shared learning panel
webinars with pharmacists from countries across the
Commonwealth discussing their response and challenges
to tackling COVID-19.
Implementation of resources/toolkits and advocacy
because of the findings
COVID-19 community of support: a dedicated email
address and a Telegram group was established to provide
a discussion and support community to members. As
part of the ‘CPA 2020 50th Birthday Challenge’ a virtual
tour of the Commonwealth was launched (which com-
menced before COVID-19 was declared a pandemic).
The CPA have used the opportunity to check in with
member organisations to understand how they are cop-
ing and how the CPA could be of further support at this
challenging time; this was also advertised on Twitter
using the hashtag #CPA2020C.
COVID-19 resources toolkit: A webpage was added
to the CPA website to signpost COVID-19 resources
that were directly relevant to the pharmacy workforce—
including international guidance, publications, tools
and resources produced by national pharmacy member
organisations. The CPA also produced a downloadable
toolkit based on the infection prevention control (IPC) 
activities that were developed as part of the CwPAMS
programme [29].
Easy to access COVID-19 resources via CwPAMS App: 
Another development which is linked to the CwPAMS
programme has been the introduction of a COVID-19
section on the CwPAMS App that was developed to bring
together resources to support IPC and antimicrobial
stewardship at the point of care, independent of internet
connection in four LMICs.
Advocacy: the CPA’s advocacy role has continued
through the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, via
the recent virtual Commonwealth Civil Society Forum, 
which traditionally takes place on the eve of the Com-
monwealth Health Ministers Meeting (CHMM) in
Geneva each year. This year, the theme was how digital
health could help support the response to the COVID-
19 pandemic. The CwPAMS App was showcased and the
CPA presented how the pharmacy workforce across the
commonwealth is well placed to use digital technologies
as part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, par-
ticularly supporting the access to quality medicines and
prescribing information. These points were reflected in
the statement and recommendations that were put for-
ward to health ministers.
CPA has also contributed to the advocacy papers ahead
of the (postponed) biennial Commonwealth Heads of
Government Meeting (CHOGM) that was set to take
place in Kigali, Rwanda, on 22–27 June 2020. These
efforts seek to raise the profile of the profession along-
side issues that need to be brought to the attention of
policy-makers relating to medicines and progressing
towards Universal Health Coverage (UHC). The theme
for CHOGM 2020 is ‘Delivering a Common Future: Con-
necting, Innovating, Transforming’. The COVID-19 pan-
demic has brought new, unprecedented health challenges
such as questions on how to ensure ongoing, equitable
access to pharmaceutical care, and protect the safety
of our current health workforce. This led to the CPA
authoring a commentary that will be disseminated to pol-
icy-makers, entitled ‘The role of the Commonwealth in
achieving UHC through pharmaceutical care amidst the
COVID-19 pandemic’ [16].
A training video on local production of hand sanitisers
based on the WHO formulation: As part of our advocacy
efforts, the CPA secured funding from the Common-
wealth Secretariat to produce a training video on local
production of hand sanitisers using the WHO formula-
tion. This was produced to help pharmacists in LMICs to
produce these alcohol-based hand sanitisers at a low cost. 
The video, which provides a step-by-step guide on the
preparation, labelling and storage of the alcohol-based
formula, has been developed under the CPA’s CwPAMS
programme.
Strengths and limitations
This survey provides a high-level overview of the issues
facing the pharmacy profession in the Commonwealth
and the potential to provide guidance to better sup-
port the response of the profession. The survey was
able to obtain responses from a large number of coun-
tries and capture the views of respondents in different
parts of the Commonwealth. There was a high level
of response from LMICs. The results however do not
provide in-depth detail of the issues potentially facing
the profession; further research to explore the barriers
Page 10
Ashiru‑Oredope et al. J of Pharm Policy and Pract (2020) 13:72  Page 10 of 11
and facilitators is warranted. Additionally, the ques-
tions used to develop the survey were not validated as
there was limited literature at the time of survey launch
to inform questionnaire development. Furthermore, 
there was the possibility of recall and self-report bias
from respondents as some questions addressed past
events. We also do not know how participants in the
CPA webinar and training applied their learning and
what the impact was on practice. Further evaluation in
future follow-up surveys is needed to explore this. Nev-
ertheless, the survey provides useful initial data amidst
a global pandemic of the pharmacy sector response and
can be used to inform ongoing work and studies.
Conclusion
The pharmacy profession played an essential role in the
COVID-19 pandemic response, for example in ensuring
ongoing medicines supply and medicines access, sup-
porting public health measures, and assisting in case
identification and management. It is crucial that global
health organisations, such as the CPA, are able to sup-
port pharmacists during the pandemic by providing the
needed guidance and advice. Our study confirms the
high level of worry amongst the profession and pro-
vides preliminary data on the issues and learning needs
of the profession. The CPA has since acted on these
findings, with ongoing opportunities to continue to
develop and refine resources for the profession as this
unprecedented global crisis continues to evolve. Phar-
macy professionals across the Commonwealth dem-
onstrated improved knowledge on the management of
COVID-19 and resources available for professionals
following education training.
