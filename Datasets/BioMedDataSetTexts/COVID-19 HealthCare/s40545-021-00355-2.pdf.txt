RESEARCH  Open Access
Young hospital pharmacists’ job stress
and career prospects amidst the COVID‑19
pandemic in China

Abstract 
Background:  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic posed a critical threat to public health in the past year and
has not been fully controlled so far. The nature of front-line young hospital pharmacists’ occupation puts them at an
increased risk of contracting any contagious disease, including COVID-19. Recent survey indicated that hospital phar-
macists in China are depressive, hostile amid the pandemic.
Aim:  The present investigation aims to understand the job stress among young hospital pharmacists during the
outbreak of COVID-19 and to provide basic information for pharmacy managers to help young fellows to cope with
job stress.
Method:  This study is adopting pharmacist job stress questionnaire as the key instrument of data collection through
WJX App in mobile phone. Demographic information, career prospects and stress management proposals were
obtained synchronously. Quantitative data were processed with SPSS. Significant differences were examined using
analysis of variance and Chi-square analysis.
Result:  About 60% of 289 questionnaire respondents complained of job stress (178 respondents). According to the
narrative description of the data, young pharmacists’ gender, education background, hospital grade, and specific
work post had no significant effect on job stress difference. However, young pharmacists in different age-groups and
professional titles showed different job stress. Pharmacists at the age of 31–35 complained more stress than the oth-
ers. Pharmacists with high professional title (deputy chief pharmacist) complained more stress than the others. About
65% of 289 respondents had long-term plan for their practice, although 61% of young pharmacists felt troubled or
worried with their future. As for stress management proposal, almost all young pharmacists hoped to improve their
professional identity via raising their wages.
Conclusion:  More than half of young pharmacists suffer from job stress amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in China, 
and various intervention measures should be taken to relieve the stress and finally improve their social identity.

Background
Currently, young hospital pharmacists face various
heavy work demands, work–life conflicts, irregular work
arrangements and heavy work pressure in China [1, 2].
To make matters worse, coronavirus disease (COVID-
19) pandemic was a critical threat to public health in the
past year or so and has not been fully controlled so far.

Latest news cites that Chinese mainland reports 27 new
COVID-19 cases, with 20 locally transmitted in Guang-
dong, and the results of detected gene sequencing in
all infected patients in Guangzhou’s latest outbreak are
homologous, all from variants detected in India [3]. The
nature of hospital pharmacists’ occupation puts them at
an increased risk of getting any contagious COVID-19
[4]. Young pharmacists are usually on the front-line of
the COVID-19 outbreak response and as such are more
at risk of contracting this virus [5]. Besides, as social dis-
tancing and non-essential businesses are implemented to
control the physical spread of COVID-19, these challeng-
ing measures increased stress, anxiety, depressive symp-
toms, and exacerbation of pre-existing mental illness [6].
Recent surveys reported negative psychological effects
were induced by COVID-19 pandemic, which included
stress, fear, anxiety, depression, burnout, hostility, and
mental exhaustion in hospital pharmacists in China [7, 
8].
Evidences showed that young pharmacists’ job iden-
tity and self-satisfaction have been at a low level in China
[9–11]. On the one hand, job burnout (such as repeated
drug dispensing from day to day), lack of sense of accom-
plishment and low social position (compared with medi-
cal doctors in hospital) contributed to the low level [12].
On the other hand, the low income of young pharmacists
has a great negative influence on their good life. Before
year of 2017, there was still 15% drug price bonus in med-
ical institution in China. At that time pharmacists were
regarded as money-maker for hospital and they got more
pay from hospital. Now, circumstances change with the
passage of time. Drug price bonus in hospital is zero. The
salary of hospital pharmacists has been greatly reduced. 
Low income brings about their survival challenge, and
impairs their physical and mental health [13]. Last but
not least, pharmacists especially young dispensing fel-
lows face the challenge of professional transformation
from simply dispensing to providing clinical pharmacy
service. Many young dispensing pharmacists even have
sprouted their intention to resign in the new context of
COVID-19 pandemic. In short, as the health care sys-
tem in China is different from that of other countries, the
characteristics of pharmacist job stress might be different
from that of other countries [14, 15]. Thus it is necessary
to clarify the current situation of job stress among Chi-
nese young hospital pharmacists during the outbreak of
COVID-19. This work aims to provide basic information
for pharmacy managers to help young fellows to cope
with job stress. 
Methods
All data are divided into four sections and collected
through WJX App in mobile phone. The first section was
the demographic information of the respondents. The
second section was job stress questionnaire. We adopted
the validated pharmacist job stress questionnaire scale as
the key instrument [16], which was composed of 12 job
stress-related questions based on the various elements of
the work (workload, work time, salary, relations with col-
leagues and leader, etc.) with five-level Likert scale (from
strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, to strongly
agree, respectively, and grades assigning from 1 to 5
points, respectively). For each respondent the total score
ranged from the minimum 12 to the maximum 60 points. 
The higher the sum value, the greater the job stresses. 
The third section dealt with personal viewpoints on pro-
fession development prospects. The fourth section was
free comments on stress management proposals.
The survey was conducted from August 1 through
September 30, 2020. Each mobile phone account is only
allowed to submit once in order to avoid submitting
questionnaires repeatedly. The study sample is young
hospital pharmacists under the age of 35 years who work
in the medical institutions at all levels in China. Partici-
pation was voluntary, and the responses were anonymous
and no identifiable information was collected. Data dif-
ferences were examined using analysis of variance and
Chi-square test.
Results
Demographic data
A total of 289 survey respondents were effectively recov-
ered with 219 females. 32 pharmacists were less than
25 years old and 153 pharmacists were over 31 years old. 
Among them, 213 pharmacists were assistant pharmacist
or pharmacist, and only 5 pharmacists were deputy chief
pharmacist. The other relevant demographic information
and practice information of the respondents are given in
Table 1.
Job stress data
Based on scale assignment statistics, score less than 24
points is regarded as no much job stress, score between
24 and 36 points is regarded as certain job stress, and
score more than 36 points is regarded as higher job
stress. In this survey, 18 respondents (6.23%) claimed
they do not feel too much job stress (6.23%), 93 respond-
ents (32.18%) felt a certain job stress, and 178 respond-
ents (61.59%) expressed higher job stress (Fig. 1).

Job stress vs gender, age, education background, hospital
grade, professional title and specific work post
Our data (Table 2) showed that no gender, education
background, hospital grade and specific work post differ-
ences in the job stress among young pharmacists in this
survey. However, different age and different professional
titles indicated a certain association with job stress. On
one hand, young hospital pharmacist with different age-
group showed significant differences in job stress levels
(P < 0.01). The job stress score (36.34 ± 10.86) of pharma-
cists in 31- to 35-year-old age-group was higher than that
of other age-group (28.28 ± 10.71 in less than 25-year-
old age-group and 34.56 ± 9.23 in 26–30-year-old age-
group), suggesting that job stress increased with length of
employment. On the other hand, corresponding to length
of employment, there was a significant difference in the
job stress among young pharmacists with different pro-
fessional titles. Their job stress scores were 29.88 ± 10.72, 
35.07 ± 10.74, 36.59 ± 9.27, and 39.80 ± 8.35 for corre-
sponding assistant pharmacist, pharmacist, pharmacist-
in-charge, and deputy chief pharmacist, respectively
(P < 0.01), suggesting deputy chief pharmacists confront

Viewpoints of young pharmacists on their profession
Answers to three questions indicated the viewpoints
of the young pharmacists on their profession prospect
(Table 3). In general, among 289 respondents, more than
30% of the young pharmacists did not have long-term
career plan for their work. And about 60% of young phar-
macists were troubled or worried about their job future. 
More than half of young pharmacists will not choose
pharmacist as profession a second time.
Specifically, more than 70% of pharmacists in the
25–30 age-group were troubled or worried about their
career future. All deputy chief pharmacists were troubled
or worried about the career future.
More than half of young pharmacists in the 31–35 age-
group would not choose pharmacist as occupation again. 
And more than 60% of deputy chief pharmacists would
not choose the profession of pharmacists any more. All
these data suggest that the profession of pharmacists was
not a satisfying one for young people under the COVID-
19 pandemic.
Stress management proposal
Almost all young pharmacists hoped to improve their
professional identity via raising their wages. Half of them
hoped that pharmacy managers could organize team
activity to release job stress. And about 50% of young fel-
lows wanted to train or study further in order to master
more skills to handle with professional transformation
and to adapt the changing COVID-19 pandemic world.
Discussion
COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered our routine, 
lifestyle, and stress level across the globe. This study
explored the job stress of Chinese young hospital phar-
macists during an outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. The

subjects of survey are young pharmacists who usually
have been working for less than 10 years. We believe that
if the young fellows are under great pressure during the
unusual pandemic, it will have an adverse impact on their
future career development.
In the past 5 years, a series of medical reform policies
and rational drug use specifications have been issued
intensively by the National Health Commission of China. 
First, the medical insurance payment mode convert
(for example, disease diagnosis-related group, DRG) is
advanced and currently being applied in medical institu-
tion national widely. Generic drugs have been advocated
for use by all levels of government. Drug centralized pro-
curement or drug quantity purchase is being executed
all over the country [17].  Second, many new practice
requirements are proposed to hospital pharmacist, such
as controlling the medical expense rise via rational drug
use. However, the pharmacist service fee has not yet
been implemented despite the appeal for many years in
China, meanwhile drug price zero bonus policy in medi-
cal institution has been implemented for couple of years. 
To a certain extent, these policies are absolutely negative
bad news for young pharmacists. COVID-19 global pan-
demic officially declared on March 11, 2020 by the World
Health Organization (WHO) furthermore brought about
invisible pressure. Many front-line hospital pharmacists
cited job stress and fear of the virus infection just like
their foreign counterparts [18]. The COVID-19 pandemic
is only the last straw to crush young pharmacists. Under
this context, it is not a surprise that this survey showed
that more than 60% young hospital pharmacist com-
plained of high job stress and worried their job future
during COVID-19 pandemic in China.
Specifically in this survey, we noted that the job stress
increased with their age/professional title. The reasons
are complex. In China, professional title in the hospital
pharmacy has five categories, climbing from the bottom
of assistant pharmacist through pharmacist, pharmacist-
in-charge, deputy chief pharmacist, to the top of chief
pharmacist. Pharmacists with different titles usually have
different specific work post responsibility and require-
ment. At the present medical practice environment, there
are more performance assessment indicators and more
workload for deputy chief pharmacists, however, their
income does not match their contribution correspond-
ingly. Deputy chief pharmacists have to bear teaching
and research work, as well as publishing papers to get
promotion, which are tough pressure for many young
pharmacists. A recent survey found that the COVID-
19 pandemic has increased psychological stress among
healthcare workers (including pharmacist) with 10 years
or more work experiences in a central hospital in China
[19], which is consistent to our results.

Although our data showed that no specific work post
differences in the job stress among young pharmacists in
this survey, 190 young dispensing pharmacists of all 289
young fellows poured out a lot of complaints besides the
questionnaire investigation. They confessed that most
outpatient pharmacies were equipped with automated
dispensary systems, but automation does not effectively
reduce the working time of dispensing pharmacists. In
addition, since outpatient pharmacy is the final stop for
hospital process, patients often turn their grievances and
anger into complaints and finally vent their anger on the
front-line dispensing pharmacist [20].  Young pharma-
cists have to bear the pressure of tense doctor–patient
relationship [21].  In China, during the peak period of
outpatient service, dispensing pharmacists are required
to dispense in short time as soon as possible without
any error. It is a great challenge. They fear being com-
plained by patients [22]. They fear COVID-19 pandemic
more and would prefer stay at home on leave without any
income.
Therefore, it is of importance for pharmacy managers
to help their young fellows in emotion management and
release their job stress especially during the COVID-19
pandemic. As 90% of young pharmacists wish to raise
salary, hospital pharmacy managers should advocate leg-
islating for pharmacist service fee. Meanwhile hospital
pharmacy managers should give their young fellows more
opportunities to day-release course study. In general, the
contribution of pharmacists in medical service should be
recognized and physical and mental health care should
be given simultaneously [23–25].
The study limitation is that job stress is measured using
as a self-reported stress level.
Conclusions
More than half of the young hospital pharmacists feel job
stress. Job stress is inevitable. Pharmacy managers should
help young fellows to alleviate their job stress and finally
improve their professional social identity.
