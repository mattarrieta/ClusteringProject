Abstract 
Background:  Since the WHO announced that Covid-19 had become a global pandemic, online pharmacies have
emerged as an extremely popular way to purchase medication due to the quarantine measures introduced by
numerous countries to prevent the virus’s spread.
Aim:  The aim of this study was to collect information regarding the extent of online medication purchasing in the
UAE and to assess the factors that motivating the purchase of medications from the internet.
Method:  A convenience sampling of people living in the UAE was used to conduct an online descriptive cross-
sectional study. Respondents were solicited using the social media platforms WhatsApp and Facebook, whereby they
were asked to fill in a validated web-based questionnaire. The number of people buying medications from online
pharmacies was calculated using a percentage with 95% CIs.
Results:  131 respondents (31.2%) [95% CI: 26.7–35.6] stated that they purchased medication via the internet after
Covid-19 was classed as a pandemic. It was found that those respondents most likely to have purchased medication
via the internet were male, single, and older and with a high school education.
Conclusion:  More research should be conducted to investigate and compare the self-medication and associated
risk factors between online pharmacies and community pharmacies. Moreover, regulatory bodies need to make and
implement changes to the regulations that govern the sale and use of medications during COVID-19.

Introduction
Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, online pharma-
cies (OPs) have become a serious public health concern
as they have expanded and become more controversial. 
In brief, OPs are websites that offer to sell medication
directly to customers via the internet [1, 2]. Surveys of
other populations have shown that 71% of European
internet users and 72% of US internet users have run
searches for information about health matters at least
once in the past year [3–5]. The spread of mobile devices
has helped to fuel this boom [6]. Increasingly, consum-
ers are using the internet to not only find out information

about their own health but also to carry out self-diagnosis
and purchase health-related products and services, where
reliability of information is not trusted due to changes in
people’s behaviours and responses due to disease out-
breaks especially that the COVID-19 pandemic has been
causing a global panic being a health shock [7–12].
In theory, the country in which an OP website is based
has control over the licensing and quality control of the
OP, and their mail-order business should be undertaken
with reference to these standards. However, numerous
OPs take pains to keep their physical location concealed, 
and so there is no certainty as to which, if any, system of
regulations any given OP is following [13]. An additional
complication is the fact that the power of national regu-
latory bodies generally ceases at their countries’ borders
[14, 15]. This leads to considerable confusion regarding
OPs, particularly as the owners of websites selling health
services and medication frequently shift their theoreti-
cal base between national jurisdictions. This means that
research must be done into the home country of an OP
and the country from which the purchases are delivered
[13]. A number of risks to patient safety exist when pur-
chasing medication online without the traditional supply
network, including the risk of receiving falsified medica-
tion [16–18].
As internet pharmacies vary in quality, the legislation
appears to be lagging behind in terms of the regulation
of this complicated and fast-moving market as regulation
of various private drug sellers is still a global challenge
contributing to inappropriate treatments particularly
at a time when health regulators globally are emphasiz-
ing that the population should quarantine themselves at
home to restrict the spread of Covid-19 [19]
This research is intended to gather information and
discover the extent to which consumers in the UAE are
using the internet for the purchase of medication and to
assess the factors that motivating the purchase of medi-
cations from the internet. This research may be helpful in
developing interventions focused on patients through the
identification of consumer patterns.
Materials and methodology
This research was undertaken using an online descrip-
tive cross-sectional questionnaire deployed between
February and April 2020. 420 individuals were issued an
invitation through WhatsApp and Facebook to fill in a
validated-web-based questionnaire. The sample cohort
comprised any individuals over 18 years of age who
expressed a willingness to complete the survey. No indi-
viduals below the age of 18 were included in the study, 
nor were any who were unwilling to participate. Recruit-
ment of participants was undertaken using a convenience
sampling technique with no pre-determined sampling 
frame; the researchers asked all their contacts on social
networks if they would consider completing the ques-
tionnaire and if they would also pass the invitation on to
their own social media contacts. The study questionnaire
was reviewed and assessed by subject experts to ensure
the content validity and reliability of the questionnaire. 
Additionally, public consultations formed part of the pro-
cess. The survey was designed such that it could be self-
administered. The initial page comprised an introductory
paragraph introducing the purpose of the research, 
confidentiality information, assurance of anonymity, 
and a series of questions about the demographics of the
respondent (age, sex, marital status, level of education, 
employment, and any chronic disease). The respondents’ 
patterns of purchasing online medication since the start
of the Covid-19 pandemic were revealed through three
questions:
• Have you purchased medication from the internet
since the Covid-19 pandemic began? (Yes/No)
• What is the frequency of your purchasing medica-
tion via the internet? (Once or twice/several times/
Frequently)
• What types of medicine have you purchased from
the internet?
Any participant who continued to the following page
was regarded as having consented to be a participant in
the study. No participant identities were recorded and
confidentiality was guaranteed. When the survey was
completed, all respondents received a thank you message
from the researchers. No form of incentive was offered
to complete the survey. Data analysis was undertaken
using SPSS version 24. The number of individuals making
purchases from the internet was rendered as a percent-
age (95% CI). Factors motivating the purchase of medica-
tions from the internet were assessed using simple binary
logistic regression in which a p-value < 0.05 was regarded
as statistically significant.
Results
Sociodemographic characteristics of the study participants
A total number of 420 respondents participated in the
study. Of the total participants, 195 (46.4%) were female
and 225 (53.6%) were male. The ages of the 420 partici-
pants were distributed as follows: 50 (11.9%) were aged
18–24, 97 (23.1%) were aged 25–34, 85 (20.2%) were
aged 35–44, 129 (30.7%) were aged 45–54, and 59 (14%)
were aged ≥ 55. Most of the participants were married
(n = 322, or 76.7%). The educational qualifications of the
participants also varied: 12 (2.9%) were high school edu-
cation holders, 140 (33.3%) held bachelor’s degrees, and
268 (63.8%) had attained post-graduate education. Of the

total number of participants, 308 (73.3%) were employed
and 332 (79%) did not have a chronic disease (Table 1).
Prevalence of online medication purchasing
during the Covid‑19 pandemic
In this study, 131 participants (31.2%) [95% CI: 26.7–
35.6] reported having purchased medication from the
internet during the Covid-19 pandemic. Of these 131
participants, 118 (91.1%) had purchased several times, 
seven participants (5.3%) had purchased frequently, and
six participants (4.6%) had purchased once or twice.
The categories of medication purchased online during
the pandemic were as follows: 26 (19.8%) participants
had purchased analgesics, 14 (10.7%) participants had
purchased anti-cough medicine, 66 (50.4%) participants
had purchased dietary supplements, 10 (7.6%) had pur-
chased nasal sprays, and 15 (11.5%) had purchased anti-
histamines. The ingredients of each medication group are
shown in Table 2.
In the present study, a significantly increased preva-
lence of purchasing medication online was observed in
male subjects [OR 1.71; 95% CI 1.12–2.61], single marital
status participants [OR 2.08; 95% CI 1.30–3.32], and high
school education holders [OR 6.93; 95% CI 1.83–26.3].
However, purchasing medication online was less preva-
lent in participants aged 35–44 [OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.18–
0.76] and aged 45–54 [OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.21–0.79] (see
Table 3).

Discussion
Since the WHO classed Covid-19 as a global pandemic, 
OPs have become an increasingly frequent means of pur-
chasing medication as a result of the quarantine condi-
tions that numerous nations have introduced in order
to mitigate the spread of the virus. Recent investigations
have suggested that the number of people using OPs to
obtain medication and other health products is on the
increase [20]. A number of surveys have shown that the
proportion of people using OPs fluctuates depending
on the survey focus and is influenced by product type, 
income, population, education, and/or problems with
substance abuse [1, 21]. This study looked at the propor-
tion of people using the internet to purchase medica-
tion since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. One-third
of respondents to the survey (31.2%) stated that they
had made medication purchases from the internet due
to the pandemic. The most frequently purchased medi-
cation from the internet were dietary supplements
(50.4%), analgesics (19.8%), antihistamines (11.5%), and
anti-cough medicine (10.7%), It should be noted that no
research is currently available regarding the percentages
of drug purchases from the internet during the Covid-19
pandemic, but past research can be used to examine vari-
ations in the pattern of purchases. Research in Saudi Ara-
bia demonstrated that online medication purchases were
not commonplace at the time of the research, with only
23.1% of respondents stating that they knew about the
availability of OPs, and only 2.7% reporting having actu-
ally made medication purchases online [22]. Alfahad et al. 
[23] returned similar findings: 82.6% of their survey sam-
ple in Saudi Arabia knew nothing about OPs, and only
1.4% of respondents had used them to buy medication.
The outcomes of this research demonstrate that the
respondents most likely to make online purchases of
medication were unmarried, male, older, and holders of a
high school education.
In a survey conducted in the USA on 443 customers of
OPs found that in comparison to those who did not use
such pharmacies, users were of a higher age bracket on
average, had higher family incomes, a higher level of edu-
cation, and a greater number of prescriptions and there
was a greater likelihood of them having private medical
insurance [24]. Atkinson et al. [25] revealed significant
associations between age/marital status and the online
purchase of medication. Nevertheless, gender, age, and/
or education level did not appear to have a significant
influence on the purchase of medication or health prod-
ucts online [26].
There are a number of patient safety issues in relation
to the purchase of medications via the internet during the
Covid-19 pandemic. Those who use OPs, legitimate or
illegitimate, purchase medications for chronic and acute

conditions, and these may include medications that can
be abused. Any drug, even dietary supplements, may be
harmful if administered without advice and/or supervi-
sion from a physician or pharmacist. The chief concerns
regarding the purchase of online medication are that OPs
do not take a rigorous history of patient conditions and
medications, patients may self-diagnose inappropriately, 
there may be clashes between medications, patients may
undergo more than one type of therapy at once, and there
may be reactions between different drugs and/or drugs
and herbal remedies [27]. Clearly, illegitimate OPs are
a significant patient threat when they sell sub-standard
medication or poor quality products, but even legitimate
pharmacies have the potential to cause serious adverse
health outcomes for users [20].
In this time of crisis, it is crucial that OPs be more
robustly controlled and that consumers be educated
regarding the ways in which they purchase medica-
tion online. Past research has shown that more empha-
sis should be placed on the way in which healthcare
providers (physicians, pharmacists, and nurses) can
assist patients by discussing with them their intentions
in terms of online medication purchasing; this could 
greatly reduce the number of adverse outcomes related
to purchasing medication from unlicensed or illegitimate
online retailers [20, 26].
The key differences in the online medication pur-
chasing behaviors before and during Covid-19 crisis is
the excessive and unregulated use of the medication. 
As reported in this study, older participants and higher
school education holders more likely to practice online
medication purchasing and this segment of society may
self-medicated and misuse these medicines as they may
suffer from chronic diseases and do not have sufficient
knowledge to use the medicines, especially since these
medicines are taken without consulting a doctor and
pharmacist.
Moreover, the enormous stress of the Covid-19 pan-
demic directed the mentality of many people of different
backgrounds and diversities towards the idea of enhanc-
ing their immunity to be able to fight the Covid-19 virus
in case of getting infected. The first weapon most peo-
ple think of to do that is starting to take different types
of vitamins and herbal supplements. For instance, many
people started to purchase multivitamins, vitamin D

supplements, Vitamin C, Echinacea products, garlic and
ginger capsules.
Such practice is done mainly through net surfing, as
this method is the most convenient one in order to stay
away from the streets and the direct contacts with others. 
This way they would feel safer, and whatever products
they think would help them get healthier would reach
them at their doors.
In addition to that, melatonin, and sleep aids were
being sold out significantly as many people needed some-
thing to help them sleep and relax under all the stress
they are facing.
Another concern regarding the online self-medi-
cation practice during Covid-19 pandemic concerns
questions surrounding the purity, quality, and authen-
ticity of the medications that are available. Lately, a
safety study was held in Dubai, UAE, by which 6/102
tested alcohol-based skin sanitizers revealed to contain
unlisted or undeclared methanol encompassed with the
ingredients. Moreover, others revealed containing alco-
hol of less than 60% although their labels stated to con-
tain alcohol of 70% [28]. A relatively similar survey in
Ajman, UAE, lead to shutting two factories down after a
great amount of sub-standard sterilizer was captured—
an approximate amount of 40,000 pieces holding a 
market value of about 500,000 United Arab dirhams. 
When the placed stickers were removed from the prod-
ucts, the original below sticker unveiled that they were
nothing but body spray perfumes, not at all medically
sterile products as per pretended [29]. Such unaccepted
practices rings the bell for medication safety attention.
Further, significant concern during Covid-19 pan-
demic is that numerous non-specialist manufacturers
began reorienting their activities towards the produc-
tion of different medications, dietary supplements, cos-
metics and personal care products. As a result, many
unregulated medications and supplements have entered
the market. Many of these online medications and sup-
plements claimed to be effective against Corona virus
disease without documented evidential support. Hence, 
public can be misled by such advertising claims on
the internet, which cannot be verified by competent
authorities raising the concern of medication safety.
Therefore, health and regulatory bodies need to make
and implement changes to the Implementing Regula-
tions that govern the use and sale of medications during
COVID-19. In addition, stricter enforcement measures
and tests need to be established to ensure that medica-
tions that are sold online are safe, of a sufficient quality, 
and authentic.

To more strictly control the sale of medication online, 
online providers should be required to register their busi-
ness and publish all safety-related information within a
central, government regulated database. Customers can
subsequently access this system to verify suppliers and
report and safety concerns or violations. There is also a
requirement to raise general awareness of the need to
verify the safety of medication products that are bought
online.
It is strongly suggested that future studies should high-
light the adverse effects that arise from medications
being purchased through internet. New evolving technol-
ogies, like “machine learning algorithms” that are used in
application of “Big Data,” is the platform for an emerging
area of medical research named as “digital” research or
“infoveillance. In accordance to this, risk of patient safety
in outpatient settings can be measured by different meth-
ods. Enhanced patient-healthcare professional education, 
communication and promotion campaigns are required
to educate the public regarding the safe approach of
online pharmacies. Targeted interventions by pharma-
cists are vital as prevention strategies that should be
stressed in the daily practice.
There are certain limitations to this study. The use of
OPs was self-reported and so could be warped by recall
bias and/or false reporting from the respondents, possi-
bly leading to an underestimation of the true figures. Fur-
thermore, this research does not differentiate between
legitimate and illegitimate retailers, chiefly because
all online sellers of medication pose as legitimate, so
respondents would be unlikely to know with certainty
what their status was.
Conclusion
This research demonstrated that around one-third of
those responding had used the internet to purchase
medication during the Covid-19 pandemic. Large-scale
longitudinal research should be undertaken to gain fur-
ther details regarding the purchase of medication online. 
Additionally, more research should be conducted to
investigate and compare the self-medication and associ-
ated risk factors between online pharmacies and commu-
nity pharmacies.
