Abstract 
COVID-19 is a threat to health systems around the world and Rwanda is not an exception. The impact of the pan‑
demic is far-reaching and access to health commodities is not spared. Proper drug supply is critical for a robust
healthcare system. It determines the extent at which the population are likely to have access to essential medicines
and treatments. In Rwanda, the pharmaceutical sector heavily relies on imports. With the emergence of COVID-19
pandemic, the drug supply system was interrupted leaving many stores from small local pharmacies to the big
medical stores running out of stock. The reasons were limited importation of goods from abroad, and the panic buy‑
ing practice among the customers and some institutions when responding to the pandemic. Drug and medicines
accessibility, availability and affordability should be the core of any drug management policy. It is with no doubt that, 
Rwanda has made a tremendous work to mitigate the effect of COVID-19 on the country’s drug supply; however, 
efforts are still needed to invest in local pharmaceutical production as a way to minimize import expenses in the
country. Good policy on drug importation, production and distribution should be enforced to avoid any drug short‑
age that may be encountered in the Rwandan drug market.

Background
COVID-19 is a global public health threat affecting
many countries around the world and Rwanda is not an
exception. The impact of the pandemic is far-reaching
and access to health commodities is not spared. Proper
drug supply is critical for a robust healthcare system. 
It determines the extent at which the population are
likely to have access to essential medicines and treat-
ments. In Rwanda, the pharmaceutical sector heav-
ily relies on imports [1]. In 2019, Rwanda spent around
$ 97.6 million on drugs import alone, and it is expected
to increase by $102.5 million in 2024 [1]. About 20% of
these import expenses are expected to be reduced by the

establishment of the first pharmaceutical factory in the
country [2]. Public and private sectors preserve the drug
supply chain in Rwanda. In public sector, the drug supply
chain system allows public health institutions to obtain
health commodities directly from central medical store
and/or district pharmacies [3]. The Medical Production
and Procurement Division (MPPD) under Rwanda Bio-
medical Centre (RBC), performs the procurement, stor-
age, and distribution of health commodities to public
health institutions and it is regarded as central medical
store. MPPD is the main supplier of all pharmaceutical
commodities ranging from essential medicines to labora-
tory reagents. However, district pharmacies serve as the
distribution point of pharmaceutical products to district
hospitals and health centres. Public sector can also get an
authorization from the Ministry of Health or/and district
pharmacies that allow them to buy pharmaceutical com-
modities from private wholesalers in case they are not

in their stores. In private sector, many wholesale phar-
maceutical companies import drugs directly from inter-
national manufacturers, and local drug compounding
pharmacies. Community pharmacies and private health
clinics or hospitals get medical commodities from these
private wholesalers.
With the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic, the drug
supply system was interrupted leaving many stores from
small local pharmacies to the big medical stores run-
ning out of stock. The reasons were limited importation
of goods from abroad (mainly china and India), and the
panic buying practice among the customers and some
institutions when responding to the pandemic, and
avoiding falling in possible health commodities shortage. 
The government of Rwanda restricted the movement of
people crossing the borders, but allowed the passage of
goods and cargo as a way to keep the continuous supply
of goods including health commodities. However, since
the demand is too high and no current local drug manu-
facturers to compensate the available gap, the drug short-
age continues to be a major issue in some settings. Drug
and medicines accessibility, availability and affordability
should be the core of any drug management policy [4];
however, it is unwarranted to consider that in a coun-
try with limited local manufacturing. This paper aims at
providing the details on current situation of drug supply
chain in Rwanda, and the efforts and shortfalls faced in
times of COVID-19 pandemic.
Current efforts
Despite Rwanda being affected by the current COVID-
19 pandemic, different global institutions and bodies
have recognized the efforts made to contain the spread
of the virus. Maintaining the continuous supply of health
commodities to COVID-19 patients as well as general
population is the challenging issue that requires regular
monitoring. However, Rwanda realized that it could only
deal with such scenario through a properly coordinated
and multi-sectoral approach [5]. Many factors influence
the current efforts to maintain the country’s drug supply
amid the pandemic.
Political commitment
At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a multi-
ministerial committee was established, and led by the
prime minister. The team is not only dealing with the
implementation of COVID-19 response and contain-
ment plans, but also ensures the continuous availabil-
ity of essential health commodities to the COVID-19
patients, frontline workers as well as general population. 
Rwanda welcomed the support of several partners, and
made advisory team of scientists to help the COVID-19
Joint Task Force (JTF) [6]. The panic practice of buying 
too many drugs and other health commodities that was
adopted by Rwandese due to the pandemic was con-
trolled. This was done by establishing the regulations
that require pharmacists to serve customers with lim-
ited quantities per person and with proper judgements. 
The government endorsed the local manufacturing of
COVID-19 response equipment ranging from hand sani-
tizers, to other personal protective equipment (PPE). The
security of the country was maintained and all pharma-
cies, hospitals and many other essential businesses were
greenlighted to continue the services but using 50% of
the employees to avoid overcrowding. This allowed the
patients on long-term treatments and chronic diseases to
access drugs when needed. Rwanda is blessed with good
governance and strong cooperation between its citizens
and local leaders, and this has hugely contributed to good
responses made to contain the virus and ensure medicine
security is prioritized.
Economic stability
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Rwanda was among
the Africa’s  fastest growing economies. Economic
growth exceeded 10% in 2019, and the strong growth
was expected in 2020. This was highly contributed by the
large public investments in the implementation of the
national strategy of transformation [7]. Many pharma-
ceutical companies are currently investing in the coun-
try, with ApexBiotech being the first company licensed
by Rwanda Food and Drug Authority (RFDA) to start
its operations, and it is currently in the final establish-
ment phase [2]. In a bid to avoid the redirection of fis-
cal resources to the COVID-19 emergency response, the
World Bank Group provided Rwanda with a credit of $
14.25 million to fund the Rwanda COVID-19 Emergency
Response Project [7]. Rwanda has a clear economic plan
that attracts foreign investors, and pharmaceutical sector
is facing a considerable growth in this case.
Price control
Medicines were generally affordable in Rwanda prior
to the pandemic. The prices of essential medicines and
drugs in public sectors are lower compared to the inter-
national procurement prices. In private sectors, the
prices are double, but still it is 30% below the interna-
tional reference prices [8].  During the pandemic, the
country faced an increase in drug and health commodi-
ties demand with limited importations, and this resulted
in some prices of the pharmaceutical products being
raised above the normal range. However, the Rwandan
Ministry of Trade and Industry warned, inspected and
fined any company that raised the prices of essential
commodities including pharmaceuticals amid the pan-
demic [9]. The list of pharmaceuticals on high demand

was publicly posted with their prices and qualities, and
pharmacies were requested to comply with it.
Privatization of pharmaceutical sector
Rwanda is currently privatizing the pharmaceutical sec-
tor. This is because the current regulations restrict MPPD
from contacting and importing pharmaceuticals directly
from international manufacturers. In this case, MPPD
uses intermediate suppliers that import drugs and other
pharmaceutical products from manufacturers and sell
them with increased prices that make health commodi-
ties quite expensive for public sectors. Therefore, Rwanda
Medical Supply (RMS) is in its introductory phase to
replace MPPD [10]. RMS will serve as the central medi-
cal store that has its full authorization to negotiate prices
and import directly from international manufacturers. 
District pharmacies will continue to serve as a distribu-
tion points and warehouses of RMS, and public health
institutions will obtain all pharmaceutical products and
medical equipment directly from there. District pharma-
cies will no longer be commercial entities, and this will
reduce the pharmaceutical costs as well as public health-
care cost in general. The adaptation of the privatization
policy will reduce the lead-time of pharmaceuticals as
well as mitigate the country’s drug supply shortage.
Challenges
Rwanda like many other African countries relies on
China and India for their medicine security [11]. This
has been a trending issue for years and with the COVID-
19 pandemic, the scenario worsened. The pharmaceuti-
cal industry is among the hardest hit by the COVID-19
pandemic, due to the increase in demand with limited
access to low materials. In Rwanda, drug supply chain is
mainly challenged by lack of enough local drug manu-
facturers and high dependence on international manu-
facturers. Although the country has made it easy to start
and operate businesses for both local and foreigners, 
there is a huge investment gap in pharmaceutical sec-
tor. Lack of capacity to manufacture good formulations
because of skills gap on product development and formu-
lation expertise, is not only the Rwandan challenge, but
also for the whole East African Community (EAC) [12].
Even though, most of East African countries borders
were closed during the pandemic, the trade of essential
businesses like food and pharmaceuticals were waived, 
allowing Rwanda to continue the consumption of drugs
manufactured in other EAC member states. However, 
due to the fact that Kenyan pharmaceutical sector was
also challenged by limited access to low materials and the
fight to satisfy its local market [13], Rwanda pharmaceu-
tical supply shortage persisted. 
Indian-owned pharmaceutical companies in Rwanda
are the ones that dominate the market. They sell drugs
to local wholesalers at reasonable prices and local whole-
salers add some amount of money as a profit since they
are commercial entities. This brings uncertainty in
the drug market, and with COVID-19, many products
became high-priced. During the time of COVID-19, all
the big pharmaceutical companies, whether Indian or
locally owned, were challenged by the export restric-
tions imposed by India and many other supplying coun-
tries [14]. This led to shortage of drugs and other health
commodities in the Rwandan market. The prices of dif-
ferent drugs increased regardless of whether they are sell-
ing new stocks, or the stocks made before the pandemic. 
Some local pharmaceutical companies have shifted
their tension from making their owned local products, 
to manufacturing hand sanitizers, facemasks and many
other PPEs that are currently needed in the fight against
COVID-19. This has led to complete shortage of some
products that are usually needed by the population. Since
other non-essential businesses were closed, Rwanda
is also facing an upsurge in new pharmacy businesses, 
which increases the pharmaceuticals demand and com-
petition in the market. [15] The delay of ApexBiotech
pharmaceutical company to start its operation that was
expected in April 2020 has also contributed to the exist-
ing medicines and drug shortage, as it was to reduce 20% 
of pharmaceutical import.
Conclusion
Rwanda, like many other African countries, needs to
strengthen the pharmaceutical sector. It is with no doubt
that, Rwanda has made a tremendous work to mitigate
the effect of COVID-19 on the country’s drug supply; 
however, efforts are still needed to invest in local phar-
maceutical production as a way to minimize import
expenses in the country. Good policy on drug importa-
tion, production and distribution should be enforced to
avoid any drug shortage that may be encountered in the
Rwandan drug market. We also recommend that Rwanda
should invest in herbal medicine research towards ensur-
ing medicine security in the country.
