Abstract
With a scientific background from filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, remdesivir entered into
the COVID-19 battle to become one of the favorable therapeutic candidates with potential antiviral activity in the
treatment of this disease. Globally, remdesivir was accessed and investigated through clinical research (clinical trials)
and clinical practice (compassionate use, expanded access, early access scheme, and emergency use). Currently,
remdesivir approval status differs between states. This paper aims to review and analyze regulatory approaches for
accessing and investigating remdesivir, by communicating regulatory variability between countries in terms of
terminology, modalities, and protocols.

Introduction
The undisputable medical need to find an effective
therapeutic in the middle of COVID-19 pandemic,
aligned regulatory authorities, clinicians, researchers,
and manufacturers to consider using unapproved thera-
peutics or unapproved indications of already approved
therapeutics with potential antiviral activity [1].  The
main goal of finding an effective therapy is not only to
determine the clinical efficacy and safety but also to de-
termine the treatment duration, sensitive patients, and
to ensure equitable patient access. As clinical trials
began to show their preliminary outcomes, the estab-
lished regulatory approaches to ensure the access to po-
tential COVID-19 therapeutics have been reviewed, and
as a consequence, some therapeutics have been revoked
and are not recommended for use anymore [2, 3].
For instance, the rapid approval of emergency use of
hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the USA on 28

March 2020 [4], consequently revoked on 15 June 2020
[2],  for safety and efficacy reasons, can be justified to
some extent for the fact that these two antimalarial
drugs had an already known safety profile in their ap-
proved indication(s).  Also, the availability of scientific
evidence in terms of safety and efficacy prompted FDA
to decide that the potential benefits of hydroxychloro-
quine and chloroquine outweigh their potential risks,
considering that no effective therapy was approved at
that time [5]. On the other hand, several immunomodu-
lating therapeutics like dexamethasone [6, 7],
interleukin-1 inhibitors [8, 9],  interleukin-6 inhibitors
[10–12],  interferon-beta [13],  Bruton’s tyrosine kinase
inhibitors [14], Janus kinase inhibitors [15], have raised
hope in the treatment of COVID-19. But with regard to
remdesivir, some of the pertinent questions include how
was remdesivir accessed in patients outside of clinical
trials? How regulatory authorities and Gilead have com-
municated these regulatory approaches to clinicians?
How the preliminary results of RCTs have affected the
expansion of remdesivir’s use in clinical practice, and
later, its approval?

Aims and methods to evaluate data on remdesivir
The main objective of this paper is to elaborate and
evaluate regulatory approaches for the use of
remdesivir outside of clinical trials. We analyzed
and relied on the scientific opinions and recom-
mendations for remdesivir published by European
Medicines Agency (EU-EMA) [16],  Food and Drug
Administration (US-FDA) [4] and Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (UK-
MHRA) [17].  We compared and analyzed the data
with the Gilead’s protocol for compassionate use
that is available on the website of the Italian Regu-
latory Agency (AIFA) [18].  The regulatory guidance
and materials [16, 19–30] (Tables 1 and 2) were
compared with peer-reviewed original articles
considering compassionate use of remdesivir [31]. 
Two expanded access trials NCT04323761 [19] and
NCT04302766 [20],  as well as RCTs including
NCT04257656 [32],  NCT04292899 [33],  NIAID trial
[34],  Inserm discovery trial, solidarity trial, and peer-
reviewed articles automatically indexed to these trials,
were analyzed [32–34].  As a support, we used the
Gilead’s formal website to evaluate communication to-
wards the public [35].
The access to remdesivir outside of clinical trials
Based on the in vitro and animal studies from SARS-
CoV and MERS-CoV as well as phase 1 clinical trials in
healthy volunteers in EBOV, Gilead recommended the
dosage and duration of treatment for remdesivir as 200
mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg from day 2 to 10 de-
pending on the clinical assessment [36].  The access of

remdesivir in COVID-19 pandemic was made possible
through several regulatory approaches within the scope
of clinical research and clinical practice [35, 37].  The
primary suitable approach for accessing and investigat-
ing remdesivir were several clinical trials, on which pa-
tients within the eligibility criteria would be monitored
properly and reliable and interpretable safety and effi-
cacy data would be gathered. Meanwhile, patients who
were not eligible to be enrolled in clinical trials would
get access to remdesivir through compassionate use (ex-
panded access, early access scheme) and emergency use
[16, 26, 28] as given in Table 3. The approval of these
regulatory approaches outside of clinical trials did not
mean that remdesivir was safe and effective, and it was
neither a formal approval nor a commitment for ap-
proval and not an authorization to provide remdesivir to
patients.
The first individual compassionate use request for
remdesivir was received on January 2020, to treat a 35-
year-old male COVID-19 patient in the USA [38],
whereupon this approach was initiated and implemented
by many other countries and in a larger number of pa-
tients [19]. The European Medicines Agency on 3 April
2020 provided not binding scientific recommendations
and opinions for conditions of the use of remdesivir out-
side of clinical trials, requested from Greece, Estonia,
Romania, and the Netherlands, recommending the target
population, dosage, treatment duration, and a summary
of the totality of the evidence [36].  Compassionate use
of remdesivir in the EU was approved by national regu-
latory authorities of Switzerland, Spain, Slovenia,
Hungary, Iceland, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal,
Romania, Slovakia, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium,
Germany, France, Estonia, and Cyprus [19].  This
authorization was designated to treat a target group of
COVID-19 patients not qualified for enrollment in clin-
ical trials, for which European regulators would strictly
review and track the safety data of remdesivir, rather
than efficacy data [39].  Although most countries have
similar regulatory requirements for enrollment to the
compassionate use programs, there is no one-size-fits-all
rule in terms of the legal basis, regulatory requirements,
and terminology as given in Table 1. Compassionate use
of Europe corresponds with expanded access in the USA
designated and approved to be used for the treatment of
individual patients, including in emergency use, for 
medium-size patent population and widespread use [40].
Hence, the compassionate use is not defined as a regula-
tory terminology by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) [40]. Compassionate use of remdesivir in Europe
is not designated for individual patients, because this ap-
proach falls within the remit of Article 5 of Directive
2001/83/EC also known as “Named Patient Basis,” ap-
plicable in emergencies [41]. Also, two expanded access
trials such as the Gilead’s NCT04323761 [19] with 268
study locations to date, and the US army’s
NCT04302766 [20] of remdesivir do not have enough
public data. This is especially in the context of study de-
sign and interventions to be further interpreted.
However, from Gilead’s perspective, there are two ter-
minologies and modalities such as “compassionate use”
designated for individual patients and “expanded access”
designated for a group of patients, stating that the
manufacturer only accepts individual requests for preg-
nant women and children less than 18 years of age [35].
This is due to the process of transitioning in expanded
access programs and the limited supply of the drug [35].
From the published original article of remdesivir’s com-
passionate use on 10 April 2020, we have seen that there
have been several issues not only in the methodology,
study design, but also in the implementation of this pro-
gram in clinics across USA, Canada, Japan, and the EU
[31].  From 25 January to 7 March, the data of 53 pa-
tients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and
ECMO were analyzed through this approach and clinical
improvement was noted in 36 patients and a non-
comprehensive safety report was available [31].
The influence of results of clinical trials in expanding
access to remdesivir
Compared to other potential drugs for treating COVID-
19, remdesivir was accessed and investigated in fewer
clinical trials. The multicenter double-blinded phase 3
RCT with a study design same as the National Institute
of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) trial
(NCT04257656) reported inconclusive data due to the
premature termination of COVID-19 outbreak in Hubei
Province of China and the low-enrollment of patients
[32].  Meanwhile, the open-label phase 3  RCT
NCT04292899 published on 27 May 2020, did not
show a significant difference between the 5-day course
and 10-day course for COVID-19 patients not

requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO in
the baseline, while patients who would need invasive
mechanical ventilation or ECMO, the treatment dur-
ation might be extended to 10 days [33]. Further inter-
pretation of this trial would be of great significance,
considering the limited medical supply and the high
cost of remdesivir.
On the other hand, the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) double-blinded placebo
trial NCT04280705, reported that remdesivir was super-
ior to placebo in speeding up the recovery time in
COVID-19 patients [34].  Remdesivir is enrolled also in
the WHO solidarity clinical trial and INSERM discovery
clinical trial. Nevertheless, there were still issues and
gaps to be elucidated especially in terms of death rates,
virus load data, and safety aspects [32–34].  However,
from these preliminary data, the Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) on 1 May 2020, approved its emergency
use for patients at all ages requiring or not requiring in-
vasive ventilation or ECMO [4]. Consequently, the Euro-
pean Medicines Agency (EMA) on 11 May 2020 revised
the recommendations for compassionate use of remdesi-
vir by extending the inclusion criteria with the addition
of patients who do not require invasive ventilation to be
treated for a period of 5 days through 10 days [16]. The
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA) on 26 May 2020 approved early access scheme
of remdesivir for patients of ≥ 12 years requiring or not
requiring invasive mechanical ventilation [17].  Since
most of the RCTs excluded pregnant women and breast-
feeding, the only therapeutic option for this group of pa-
tients was the use of remdesivir outside of clinical trials,
although the EMA did not agree to use remdesivir in
pregnant women at the beginning [16]. 
Assessment Report of remdesivir [43].  The approval
of remdesivir by the European Union on 3 July 2020
was mainly influenced by the outcomes from the piv-
otal NIAID trial [43].  Under this approval, remdesivir
will be available only for pneumonia COVID-19 pa-
tients (12 years and older, weighing at least 40 kg) re-
quiring oxygen support in an initial dose of 200 mg
on day 1 followed by 100 mg once daily on day 2–10
[44].  Soon after the issuance of conditional approval
of remdesivir in the EU, the positive recommendation
for early access scheme of remdesivir in the UK was
withdrawn [45]. Mean while in the US, the emergency
use authorization for remdesivir is still applicable
[28];  Australia on 10 July 2020 issued a provisional
approval for remdesivir after the recent approval from
the EU, Japan, and Singapore [46].  To ensure equit-
able access for remdesivir in developing countries, the
manufacturer Gilead is focused on advancing the
manufacturing process and agreed to contract several
generic developers to manufacture remdesivir [47]. To
explore its potential to be used in the early stages of
the disease and to avoid the hospitalization, the in-
haled formulation of remdesivir is going to be evalu-
ated in clinical trials [48].  Remdesivir is also under
two clinical trials together with immunomodulators
[49, 50] and under a clinical trial to evaluate the
safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in pediatric
population [51]. Although on 10 July 2020, Gilead an-
nounced new additional information for remdesivir
[52],  still there is a need to accumulate more safety
and efficacy data for the use of remdesivirespecially in
children, pregnant women, breastfeeding, and patients
with comorbidities.
Conditional approval and further implications
In response to the current medical need for an effective
therapeutic in context of public health crisis caused by
COVID-19, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on
30 April 2020 commenced a rolling review of the totality
of evidence for remdesivir, as a potential therapeutic in
the treatment of COVID-19 [42]. During this review, the
EMA assessed the scientific dossier comprising of ad-
ministrative, quality, preclinical, and clinical data pro-
posed by Gilead and the available published literature
and studies [43].
On 25 June 2020, the European Medicines Agency
(EMA) issued a positive recommendation for the con-
ditional approval of remdesivir in the European
Union, although its safety and efficacy profile was not
entirely elucidated [44].  Nevertheless, the EMA laid
down explicit obligations in terms of quality, safety,
and efficacy to be provided from Gilead, within a
given deadline annexed at the European Public 
Conclusion
COVID-19 pandemic has influenced large clinical tri-
als to be conducted. As for the use of remdesivir out-
side of clinical trials, the attitudes of regulatory
authorities across countries have been different from
one to another, either in regulatory approvals or in
protocols. Preliminary results of RCTs (mainly the
NIAID trial) have altered the opinion of regulatory
authorities on remdesivir, either by recommending or
approving its use outside of clinical trials. Only after
the clinical endpoints and other crucial characteristics
of RCTs will be analyzed and interpreted, and further
trials will generate more data about specific popula-
tion, we will be able to see if regulatory authorities
have acted well or otherwise. It is imperative to edu-
cate clinicians regarding regulatory mechanisms for
early access of investigational drugs so that they
understand the possibilities that their patients have in
unmet medical situations.
