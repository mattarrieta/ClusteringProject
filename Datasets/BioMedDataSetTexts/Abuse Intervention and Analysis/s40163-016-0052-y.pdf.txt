Introduction to the special edition ‘Child
sexual abuse: analysis and intervention’
Ella Cockbain1* and Danielle M. Reynald2
Sexual offending against children is often framed as a
‘unique, inexplicable phenomenon’ (Wortley and Small-
bone 2012 p. 46). Child sexual abuse is after all virtually
unparalleled in its ability to generate outrage, disgust and
confusion (see, e.g. Greer 2003; Martellozzo 2012; Wort-
ley and Smallbone 2012). Attributing such illegal and dis-
turbing behaviour to an inherent criminal ‘disposition’ or
medical abnormality (e.g. paedophilia) can have the com-
forting effect of othering offenders.
Yet there are evident flaws in the idea that those who
sexually abuse children form a clearly delineated group
of deviant monsters Wortley and Smallbone (2006a, 
2012). Until recently, research focused overwhelmingly
on assessing the psychopathologies of convicted child
sex offenders in clinical settings Wortley and Small-
bone (2006a, b).  Yet despite substantial research of
this nature, few empirically-substantiated patterns in
offenders’ demographic or personality characteristics
were found (Kaufman et al. 2006). Exceptions, such as a
marked tendency to be male rather than female, are gen-
erally so broad as to be of little practical use in targeting
interventions. Herman (1988 p. 702) argued that from a
diagnostic standpoint ‘the most striking characteristic of
sex offenders… is their apparent normality’. There is also
a small but growing body of research highlighting the
criminal versatility of sex offenders (e.g. Cockbain and
Wortley 2015; Simon 1997, 2000; Smallbone and Wortley
2000, 2004). Contrary to popular perception, the average
sex offender has so far been shown to be a criminal gen-
eralist rather than a committed specialist.
If we are to get better at explaining and preventing
child sexual abuse, the research field must evolve beyond
its traditional focus on individual psychopathology. 
One particularly fruitful area in recent years has been
the rapid growth in studies from a situational perspec-
tive (e.g., Brayley et al. 2011; Cockbain et al. 2011, 2015;

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article 
Deslauriers-Varin and Beauregard 2010; Leclerc et al. 
2008, 2009a, b, 2011; Terry and Ackerman 2008; Wort-
ley and Smallbone 2006b, c, 2012). Rather than address
the ‘why’ of child sexual abuse, such situational enquir-
ies typically focus on the ‘what’, ‘where’, ‘how’, ‘when’ and
‘who’. A better understanding of the immediate dynam-
ics of situations in which offences occur can open up new
avenues for interventions, informing targeted manipu-
lations designed to deter offending, improve detection, 
support victims and so forth. After all, understanding
factors promoting child sexual abuse is only half the chal-
lenge: the other half is translating this knowledge into
on-the-ground efforts to tackle the crime.
Amid these developments, we were delighted to have
the chance to bring together leading researchers and
practitioners worldwide for Crime Science journal’s first
special edition on child sexual abuse. We hope that this
special edition will help increase awareness of and inter-
est in theoretical, empirical and practical developments
in the prevention of child sexual abuse. It includes a broad
array of research and commentaries, covering four differ-
ent continents, many different forms of sexual offending
and diverse aspects to offending, victimisation, identi-
fication and intervention. Indeed, the breadth of cover-
age of the edition itself highlights just how much about
child sexual abuse remains unknown and unexplored. 
Some of the contributions may make for unsettling and
provocative reads, not just because of the sensitive sub-
ject matter but also because of the challenges to accepted
wisdoms that they contain. We must remember, however, 
that engaging scientifically with controversial issues and
unearthing and confronting false assumptions are critical
steps in advancing responses to sexual abuse of children. 
The order in which we discuss the contributions below
reflects the order we suggest when reading the special
issue.
In his short commentary, Wortley (2015) argues that
one of the most fundamental challenges facing child
sexual abuse research is maintaining objectivity in the

face of such an emotive and controversial issue. Moral
panic based on untested—or outright erroneous—popu-
lar wisdom impedes the development of the scientific
evidence-base on child sexual abuse and effective coun-
ter-measures. If the field is to progress, he contends, 
then researchers must not only commit to ‘dispassion-
ate objectivity’ in their enquiries but find the ‘courage to
challenge some sacred cows’.
In their research article, Cockbain and Wortley (2015) 
contest the commonly held view of internal (or domes-
tic) sex trafficking as highly sophisticated and well-organ-
ised with evidence from their exclusive data on internal
sex trafficking of British children. With little empirical
research done on internal child sex trafficking, this paper
offers unique empirical insights about the dynamics of
this type of crime based on innovative analyses of victim, 
offender and crime event characteristics from six major
UK police cases. Testing these data against expectations
derived from the opportunity theories of crime, and in
particular the routine activity approach, this paper pro-
vides strong support for the opportunity framework and
the viability of situational prevention in tackling internal
child sex trafficking.
The CRAVED (concealable, removable, available, valu-
able, enjoyable and disposable) model was designed to
explain why certain products are stolen more than oth-
ers. Its application has largely been limited to the acquisi-
tive crime literature in which it was developed. In their
research article, Beauregard and Martineau (2015) 
explore whether the model has untapped potential in
explaining patterns of sexual victimisation. Using a sam-
ple of 350 Canadian sexual homicide cases, the authors
examine victim selection from a routine activity perspec-
tive using CRAVED.
McKillop et al. (2015) also apply the routine activity
approach to investigate contextual risk factors in offend-
ers’ first known child sexual abuse incident. Focusing par-
ticularly on how victim age influences the timing, context
and nature of the first abuse incident, they surveyed 100
adult males convicted of contact sexual offences with
children about situational characteristics of these inci-
dents. Their research article highlights the importance of
age-related routine activities in defining the opportunity
structures and convergence settings for these incidents. It
also raises important issues around the conceptualisation
of guardianship against child sexual abuse.
With the proliferation of the Internet has come concern
about the risks children face online. One such issue that
has attracted growing research interest is sexually moti-
vated online communication with children, also known
variously as online grooming, luring or solicitation. In
their research article, Quayle and Newman (2016) ana-
lyse 264 reports of grooming received by a Canadian 
watchdog (cybertip.ca). They explore factors associated
with reporting suspicious online activity of this nature, 
looking at various parties’ (victim, suspect, reporter) 
characteristics and the behaviours triggering concern.
A growing body of research exists on the associa-
tions between child sexual abuse victimisation and
diverse physical, psychological, economic and social
outcomes. In their research article, De Jong and Bijlev-
eld (2015) argue that a major limitation of this literature
is that few studies examine systematically the mediating
role that may be played by characteristics of the abuse. 
In their article, they investigate the association between
sexual victimisation in childhood and three family out-
comes: teen parenthood; marriage; and divorce. Using a
sample of 910 victims in the Netherlands, they examine
whether and how the nature of the abuse, characteristics
of the victims and their relationships to the perpetrators
affected the outcome variables.
Leclerc et al. (2015) turn their attention to the under-
researched area of child sexual abuse in youth-oriented
organisations. Using a small Canadian sample (n = 23) of
adult males who admitted to sexual offences against chil-
dren in youth organisations, they obtain recommenda-
tions for preventing abuse in these specific contexts from
offenders themselves. Drawing on this offender-based
research approach, their research article concludes by
mapping these prevention recommendations unto the 25
situational crime prevention techniques to illustrate how
the data can inform situational prevention.
In their short commentary, Belur and Singh (2015) 
reflect on the changing situation around child sexual
abuse in India. Attitudes and responses to child sex-
ual abuse in India diverge greatly from those we take
for granted in the United Kingdom or United States, 
for example. In the wake of new legislation on sexual
offences against children, the authors highlight some
unintended but potentially problematic consequences of
criminalising all sexual activity involving under 18 year-
olds. Their discussion focuses on three key areas: auton-
omy and consent; age determination; and mandatory
reporting.
Rayment-McHugh et al.’s (2015) theoretical article
highlights key ways in which existing analyses of and
responses to child sexual abuse can be strengthened by
adopting more focused place-based approaches. Based
on evidence showing that child sexual abuse—like all
other types of crime—is concentrated in particular
places, they argue in favour of prevention initiatives that
target small, clearly-defined locations over larger popula-
tion-based approaches. Their line of argument concludes
with the presentation of a conceptual model of place-
based prevention which elucidates six critical steps for
preventing child sexual abuse at the local level.

Overall, this special issue collection offers original
insights into various dimensions of the problem of child
sexual abuse and highlights fruitful directions for future
research in this area. Wortley highlights the overarching
need to focus on establishing a scientific evidence-base
if the ultimate goal of tackling child sexual abuse is to be
achieved. The other contributions in this special issue illus-
trate how this goal can be achieved through: (1) improve-
ments in the conceptualisation and operationalisation
of key constructs related to this type of crime; (2) using
various types of unique data for more precise, more holis-
tic and richer measurements when studying child sexual
abuse in its diverse forms; (3) applying innovative analytical
approaches to improve the robustness of research findings
and practical interventions for prevention; and (4) a greater
focus on understanding child sexual abuse not just in the
developed world but in developing countries, including
changes to attitudes and legislative responses there.
Perhaps one of the most powerful contributions that
this special edition makes to both researchers and prac-
titioners is its overall insight into the use of different and
innovative data sources to triangulate key findings about
different forms of child sexual abuse. Using very differ-
ent datasets, the contributions collectively highlight the
importance of opportunity in facilitating various forms
of child sexual abuse and how various types of situational
approaches may be beneficial for prevention. Equally sig-
nificant in these contributions is the lesson that context
gives rise to specific opportunity structures that are criti-
cal when we consider the risks and effects associated with
various forms of child sexual abuse, as well as practical
interventions for harm reduction.
