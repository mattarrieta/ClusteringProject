Science and child sexual abuse: 
navigating the pathway between emotion
and objectivity
Richard K Wortley*
Abstract 
Child sexual abuse is an issue that generates strong emotions, but scientific analysis of the problem demands
dispassionate objectivity. This paper explores the tension between these two opposing responses. The scientific
analysis of child sexual abuse can produce results that conflict with accepted wisdom. Research findings, such as
those showing that victims of child sexual abuse do not necessarily suffer long-term psychological harm, can be
misinterpreted to suggest support for the normalisation of child sexual abuse and risk provoking a backlash. In order
to develop effective evidence-based prevention strategies researchers may need to challenge popularly held beliefs
about child sexual abuse, taking care to do so in a way that recognises the sensitivities surrounding the topic.
Keywords:  Child sexual abuse, Crime science, Rind controversy, Crime prevention
The sexual abuse of children is an issue that, quite rightly, 
generates strong emotions. The thought of innocent and
vulnerable children being sexually exploited and debased
evokes our compassion for the victims and outrage
towards those who perpetrate such acts. Speaking per-
sonally, that someone close to me could become a victim
of sexual abuse is intolerable to contemplate and if it were
to occur I would struggle to feel anything other than a
desire for vengeance against the offender.
But as someone who has a scientific interest in child
exploitation and its prevention, I must try to think in a
different way. In the tradition of Karl Popper (1972),
science famously aspires to be the cool and dispassion-
ate seeker of the truth. Intellectually I know that in order
to prevent offenders sexually abusing children we need to
try to understand the causes of their behavior. Likewise, 
if we are to protect children from sexual abuse we need
to examine in an objective way the complex dynamic
that often exists between victims and their exploiters. 
From a scientific point of view, getting swept up in a
moral panic about child sexual abuse is not only unhelp-
ful but it can be positively counterproductive, impeding

the development of effective, evidence-based prevention
responses.
The pursuit of objective knowledge about child abuse, 
however, is not always a comfortable journey. When try-
ing to account for the behaviour of offenders, portray-
ing them as the deviant ‘other’ is on safe ground. More
threatening is to explore the non-deviance of many
offenders. The research throws up some challenging
questions in this regard. If offenders are peculiarly driven
to abuse children then why, on average, do they wait until
their early thirties to begin sexually offending (Small-
bone and Wortley 2000)? Why, if attraction to children
is the result of a stable pathology, is the reconviction rate
for child sex offenders as low as 13% (Hanson and Bus-
siere 1998)? And, if child sex offenders are a small and
discrete subsection of the community, why do nearly a
quarter of non-offender males admit to experiencing
sexual attraction towards children (Smiljanich and Briere
1996).  The competing explanation to the sexual devi-
ance model is that many child sex offenders do not have
entrenched sexual attractions to children but are tempted
to offend under certain situational conditions. This is an
important insight, as it leads us to consider what those
certain conditions are and how they might be altered to
inhibit offending. But it also means that the potential to

experience attraction to children extends more deeply
into the ‘normal’ population than most people would
care to admit: the line between normal and abnormal
becomes disturbingly blurry.
If we are uncomfortable talking about offenders in an
objective way, sensitivities increase tenfold when we turn
our attention to victims. A frank examination of the vic-
timization process and the sequelae for victims takes us
into truly controversial territory. We must acknowledge
that children may develop emotional relationships with
perpetrators to satisfy unmet needs and may ‘willingly’ 
engage in sexual activity with them (Cockbain et al. 2011; 
Wolak et al. 2008). We must confront the unsettling fact
that children may experience ‘bad touch’ as stimulat-
ing and pleasurable (Sanderson 2004) and that one of
the consequences of sexual abuse is the hyper-sexual-
isation of some victims (Berliner and Conte 1990). And
we need to understand that victims of child sexual abuse
vary greatly in their reactions to their victimisation, and, 
though many are severely traumatised, around a quarter
exhibit no detectable long-term symptoms (McGloin and
Widom 2001), while some may even reframe the expe-
rience in positive terms (Himelein and McElrath 1996).
Again these are important, practical findings. They have
implications, for example, for the sort of safety advice
that children might be given, or for the tailoring of thera-
peutic interventions for victims of abuse.
Raising such matters, however, is not without risk. In
1998, US researchers Bruce Rind, Phillip Tromovitch and
Robert Bauserman published a meta-analysis involving
59 studies examining the psychological consequences for
victims of child sexual abuse (Rind et al. 1998). They con-
cluded that child sexual abuse did not necessarily result
in long-term psychological damage, and the extent to
which it did depended on factors such as the degree of
coercion or force employed by the perpetrator. They were
at pains to stress that these findings had no implications
for the moral or legal status of child sexual abuse and
that they were not arguing for the normalisation of pae-
dophilia or for any change to existing laws. Nevertheless
their paper created a storm of criticism. It was picked up
by a number of popular media commentators and soon
attracted the attention of politicians (Baird and Politics
2002; Lilienfeld 2002; Oellerich 2000).  In an unprece-
dented move, a resolution condemning the research was
passed by the United States House of Representatives
355-0 and confirmed by the Senate 100-0. In response
to public outrage about the supposed support the paper
gave to child sexual abuse, the American Psychologi-
cal Association, which published the paper, declined to
endorse its findings.
I was asked by the editors of this special edition of
Crime Science to set out a ‘where to from here’ research 
agenda for child sexual abuse. I might have written about
the need for more studies on non-treatment offender
samples in order to redress the current sampling bias in
the literature; or the need to keep a focus on intrafamilial
abuse, often overlooked but still overwhelming the most
pressing child sexual abuse problem; or the need for eval-
uation studies to examine the effectiveness of proposed
prevention strategies; or, in the case of online child sexual
exploitation, the need to bring social scientists and com-
puter scientists together in order to develop truly multi-
disciplinary responses to the problem. However, rather
than compile a list of research topics, I have chosen
instead to focus on a more fundamental challenge facing
those interested in taking forward a scientific examina-
tion of child sexual abuse. As the Rind case demonstrates, 
there is often a clash between scientific evidence and
popular knowledge and it is easy for well-meaning and
useful research to be misconstrued. With care and sen-
sitivity, researchers must have the courage to challenge
some sacred cows concerning the sexual victimisation of
children, not because they do not care passionately about
the plight of victims but because they do.
Compliance with ethical guidelines
Competing interests

This is an invited contribution from the editors. It is a commentary for the
special edition that is intended to set out the challenges for future research
in this area. It highlights a fundamental problem encountered by researchers
in this field, that is, the fact that many findings will conflict with accepted
wisdom and may generate a backlash from advocates and the public.
