How victim age affects the context
and timing of child sexual abuse: applying the
routine activities approach to the first sexual
abuse incident
Nadine McKillop1*, Sarah Brown2, Richard Wortley3 and Stephen Smallbone1
Abstract 
The aim of this study was to examine from the routine activities approach how victim age might help to explain the
timing, context and nature of offenders’ first known contact sexual abuse incident. One-hundred adult male child
sexual abusers (M = 45.8 years, SD = 12.2; range = 20–84) were surveyed about the first time they had sexual contact
with a child. Afternoon and early evening (between 3 pm and 9 pm) was the most common time in which sexual
contact first occurred. Most incidents occurred in a home. Two-thirds of incidents occurred when another person was
in close proximity, usually elsewhere in the home. Older victims were more likely to be sexually abused by someone
outside their families and in the later hours of the day compared to younger victims. Proximity of another person
(adult and/or child) appeared to have little effect on offenders’ decisions to abuse, although it had some impact on
the level of intrusion and duration of these incidents. Overall, the findings lend support to the application of the rou-
tine activities approach for considering how contextual risk factors (i.e., the timing and relationship context) change
as children age, and raise questions about how to best conceptualize guardianship in the context of child sexual
abuse. These factors should be key considerations when devising and implementing sexual abuse prevention strate-
gies and for informing theory development.

Background
The application of situational theories to the sexual vic-
timization of children is a relatively new and under
researched area (Smallbone and Cale 2015). Yet, the small
number of available empirical studies (e.g., Leclerc et al. 
2010, 2011, 2015; Terry and Ackerman 2008; Wortley and
Smallbone 2006) call attention to the utility of these theo-
ries for answering specific questions about how, where
and when sexual abuse incidents occur, their nature and
severity. This has important implications for the design

that potentially increase the risk of perpetration.
From a situational perspective, the routine activities
approach may be particularly helpful for understand-
ing factors such as the timing, location and contexts of
sexual abuse incidents. In their original formulation of
the routine activities approach, Cohen and Felson (1979) 
proposed that for any criminal act to occur three compo-
nents must align in time and space: a vulnerable victim; a
motivated offender; and the absence of a capable guard-
ian. A key premise of the routine activities approach is
that crime occurs when opportunities (i.e., the alignment
of these factors) arise during the course of victims’ and
offenders’ everyday routines. Other scholars (e.g., Hin-
delang et al. 1978; Kaufman et al. 2006) have similarly
proposed that offenders’ exposures to potential victims

are shaped more generally by their lifestyle factors. In
the same sense, as children grow older and their life-
styles change, opportunity structures alter within their
social ecologies, influencing their exposure to potential
offenders and guardianship dynamics (Finkelhor and
Hashima 2001). For example, younger children are more
often supervised within the home; ‘middle-aged’ chil-
dren’s activities are often centred around school and after
school recreational activities and friendships; while older
children and adolescents are given more independence
both within and outside the home and across longer time
periods during the day. Thus, it is as likely that where, 
when, and by whom children are sexually abused will be
shaped (or even dictated) by their age-related routines
and lifestyles.
In his preconditions model of child sexual abuse, 
Finkelhor (1984) considered the role of environmen-
tal factors. He proposed that the usual external inhibi-
tors or constraints (e.g., levels of supervision, access to
unsupervised children and so on) need to be overcome
before an incident of sexual abuse can occur (Finkelhor
1984). More recently in their integrated theory of sexual
offending, Smallbone et al. (2008) proposed that social
ecosystems demarcate the routine activities of potential
victims and offenders, thereby presenting or restricting
opportunity structures for sexual abuse to transpire. As
situational factors are the most proximal factors within
these social ecosystems, they exert the most direct and
powerful influences on an individual’s behaviour (Mar-
shall and Barbaree 1990; Smallbone et al. 2008). Within
this context, situations may present opportunities that
an already-motivated abuser may exploit, while some
situations may also precipitate abuse-related motiva-
tions that may otherwise not have arisen (Wortley and
Smallbone 2006; Wortley 2008). These frameworks may
be especially important for understanding offenders’ 
first sexual abuse incident, where entrenched sexually-
abusive motivations may not yet be formed (Smallbone
et al. 2008).
The routine activities approach has been successfully
applied to other forms of crime prevention, particularly
property crime (Fisher et al. 1998; Kennedy and Forde
1990; Meithe et al. 1987; Rotton and Cohn 2003) and
more recently cybercrime (e.g., Pratt et al. 2010; Reyns
et al. 2011). Empirical evidence also exists for the utility
of the routine activities approach for explaining personal
victimization (Kennedy and Forde 1990; Stathura and
Sloan 1988), including violence against women (Rodg-
ers and Roberts 1995) and sexual assault against adults
(Cass 2007; Franklin et al. 2012; Jackson et al. 2006; 
Schwartz and Pitts 1995). Yet, there has been some hesi-
tation in applying these more traditional criminological
frameworks to child sexual abuse incidents. Perhaps, as 
Finkelhor and Hashima (2001) suggested, this is because
“child victimizations do not map neatly onto conven-
tional crime strategies” (p. 50), leading historically to a
tendency for criminal justice responses to focus on the
unusual (or extreme) events (e.g., child abductions) and
‘stranger danger’, with little regard to the risks of sexual
abuse ‘closer to home’. This is despite the fact that sex-
ual abuse most commonly occurs in private settings
(Colombino et al. 2011; Snyder 2000),  perpetrated by
known and trusted individuals (Richards 2011; Small-
bone and Wortley 2001; Quadara et al. 2015; Tarczon and
Quadara 2012).
Some empirical evidence derived from studies of child
sexual abuse appears consistent with the routine activi-
ties approach. For example, Smallbone and Wortley’s
(2000) research showed that, for the most part, many
child-sex offenders do not actively seek out opportuni-
ties to exploit children sexually, at least not initially. 
Instead they often take advantage of opportunities aris-
ing in the context of everyday lives, and particularly in
the context of caregiver duties (Smallbone 2006). Evi-
dence that younger children tend to be at greater risk of
familial abuse and older children of nonfamilial abuse
(Fischer and McDonald 1998; Smallbone et al. 2008; 
Snyder 2000) is consistent with expected changes in chil-
dren’s routine activities from within the home to outside
the home as they grow older. Recently, Leclerc and Fel-
son (2014) and, to a lesser extent, Deslauriers-Varin and
Beauregard (2010) directly applied the routine activities
approach, respectively to the investigation of adolescent-
perpetrated sexual abuse incidents, and serial, stranger
sexual offending against both adults and children. Both
these studies demonstrated support for the routine
activities approach, but this appears to be the extent of
the research to date.
These studies, among others examining the situational
aspects of adult sex offenders’ modus operandi (e.g.,
Kaufman et al. 1998; Lang and Frenzel 1988; Leclerc et al. 
2005, 2008), have tended to focus on the active role of the
perpetrator in the offence process—how adults utilize
and manipulate routines, relationships and situations to
groom and sexually exploit children. Comparatively lit-
tle recognition has been given to how children’s routines
might also drive the convergence of these factors. To our
knowledge, no study has examined the onset of adult-
perpetrated sexual abuse incidents from this perspective. 
Such investigations could therefore lead to new theoreti-
cal developments and prevention initiatives in the field of
sexual violence and abuse.
One particular aspect of the routine activities
approach that has received more recent attention in the
sexual abuse field is the concept of guardianship (e.g.,
Leclerc et al. 2015). In their conceptualization, Leclerc
Page 3
McKillop et al. Crime Sci (2015) 4:17  Page 3 of 10
et al. (2015) opted for the most basic premise of guardi-
anship, that the mere presence of someone in the vicin-
ity of the offence location—either child or adult—can
potentially play a guardianship role. There are indeed
inherent challenges in the conceptualization and opera-
tionalization of guardianship in the context of sexual
abuse, as Leclerc et al. (2015) have rightly acknowl-
edged. Whilst children may be present they may not, 
nor should be expected to, have the emotional or physi-
cal capabilities to intervene. However, for the current
study, as with that of Leclerc et al. (2015), we contend
that the actual capability or intent of the guardian to
intervene might be of less significance in some circum-
stances than the offender’s perception of this risk. One
such circumstance where the mere presence of some-
one else close by (including other children) might be
particularly influential in offender decision-making
is the first sexual abuse incident. Unlike Leclerc et al. 
(2015), we sought to isolate this first incident from sub-
sequent offences, on the premise that this is a point in
the criminal career where offenders may be especially
cognizant of the potential for detection; such factors
may become less influential in the commission of sub-
sequent offences, when the offender has successfully
tested such parameters.
The aim of this study was therefore to consider the
characteristics of first sexual abuse incidents from the
routine activities approach with a specific focus on how
victim age might influence the timing (when), context
(where and by whom) and nature (what happened and
how) of these incidents, including any interactions with
victim gender. Our rationale for focussing on the first
abuse incident is simple—it is the single, most impor-
tant incident to prevent. Given the known harms asso-
ciated with contact child sexual abuse, more attention
needs to be given to the circumstances in which child
sexual abuse first unfolds so that prevention efforts can
be implemented towards forestalling these incidents
from occurring in the first place (see also, McKillop
et al. 2012). In terms of examining the links between vic-
tim age and the timing and context of the onset sexual
abuse incident we first examined whether older children
would be more likely than younger children to be sexu-
ally abused:
1. by someone outside the family and during later hours
of the day, and
2. outside a residential (i.e., domestic) setting and dur-
ing later hours of the day.
We were also interested to examine:
3. whether other people (adults or children) were in
close proximity when the abuse was initiated, and
4. how this presence may have influenced the nature
this abuse incident. 
Methods
Participants
The sample comprised 100 adult males convicted of at
least one contact sexual offence involving a child 15 years
of age or younger. Participants’ average ages when sur-
veyed was 45.79 years (SD = 12.16; range = 20–84 years).
The majority (86%) identified as non-Indigenous Austral-
ian, 11% as Indigenous Australian, 2% as Asian and 1% 
New Zealand Maori. Half of the participants (51%) had
completed some secondary education (up to grade 11; 
15–16 years); 7% had completed their secondary educa-
tion (i.e., at 17–18 years); and 17% had a primary edu-
cation only (i.e., to 12–13 years only). One-quarter had
completed tertiary level education (i.e.,  university or
technical college).
The mean current sentence length was 8.28 years
(SD  = 6.15, range  = 9 months–25 years). The number
of current sexual offence convictions ranged from 1 to
116 (M  = 12.89, SD  = 17.03). Most common offences
included indecent treatment of a child (77%), maintaining
a sexual relationship with a child (48%) and rape (41%).
Other convictions included incest (10%), unlawful carnal
knowledge of a child (9%), indecent assault (3%); sexual
assault (3%) and sexual homicide (2%)a. Over one-quarter
(27%) of offenders were serving a concurrent sentence for
nonsexual offences. About one-quarter (27%) had previ-
ous sexual offence convictions, and about half (51%) had
previous nonsexual offence convictions.
Measures
This study formed part of a larger nationally-funded
research project examining the onset and progression
of contact child sexual abuse incidents. The self-report
instrument was designed to elicit detailed information
about offenders’ sexual contacts with children, regardless
of whether or not these incidents had ever been reported
to the police and/or prosecuted. These included offences
defined under the Australian and New Zealand Standard
Offence Classification (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2011) 
as acts involving direct physical contact with the child vic-
tim such as attempted or completed rape, carnal knowledge, 
incest and aggravated sexual assault. Only information per-
taining to the first (i.e., onset) contact sexual abuse incident
was used for this study and included the following:
Victim and offender characteristics
Each participant was asked to record his age at the time
of his first sexual contact with a child, and to record the
age and gender of his first sexual abuse victim.
Relationship context
Each participant was asked to select whether his relation-
ship to the first sexual abuse victim was: (1) familial (e.g., 
Page 4
McKillop et al. Crime Sci (2015) 4:17  Page 4 of 10
biological or step-child, niece/nephew, grandchild);  (2) 
nonfamilial (e.g., child of friend, neighbour, met through
workplace); or, (3) stranger (e.g., knew child for less than
24 h). This was coded dichotomously as familial or nonfa-
milial (including stranger onset cases).
Offence setting
Each participant was asked to indicate the location where
the sexual contact took place (e.g., in a home, school, 
park, shopping centre). These locations were coded as
either a domestic or non-domestic (i.e., organisational or
public) setting. 
circumstances surrounding their first and subsequent
(if applicable) sexual contacts with children. Offi-
cial demographic and offence history data were also
obtained directly from participants’ correctional files. 
Participation was strictly confidential and voluntary. 
Complete anonymity was offered due to the sensi-
tive nature of information contained in the survey. We
began our analysis of the first abuse incident by exam-
ining the offence characteristics, before conducting a
series of ANOVAs to examine differences in victim age
according to the timing, context, and nature of these
first abuse incidents.
Offence timing
Each participant was asked the time (in 3-h time peri-
ods) when he had sexual contact with the victim. This
was coded as: (1) 6 am–3 pm; (2) 3 pm–9 pm; and (3) 
9 pm–6 am, to reflect morning, afternoon and evening
routine-based activities.
Sexual acts
Participants were asked to disclose the types of contact
sexual acts they engaged in with the child. These were
coded dichotomously as penetrative (i.e.,  vaginal, anal, 
oral or digital penetration) or non-penetrative (i.e., touch-
ing or fondling breasts, genitals or bottom; masturbation).
Duration of incident
Participants were asked to record the duration of these
incidents according to whether they occurred for: (1) less
than 5 min; (2) 5–15 min; and (3) more than 15 min.
Presence of others
Participants were asked to record whether or not there
was anyone else present or in close proximity when the
abuse took place and if so, to identify, from a list, who
this person was (e.g., child or adult), the relationship to
that person and where this person was at the time of the
offence. They were also asked whether the incident was
directly witnessed or not. Both presence of others and
witnesses were coded dichotomously (0 = no, 1 = yes).
The test–retest reliability of the onset offence variables
has been previously demonstrated (McKillop et al. 2012).

increased with age: 11% were under 5 years of age, 42% 
aged 6–11 and 47% over 12 years of age. Females were
approximately three times more likely than males to be
offenders’ first victims (72 vs 28%), but on average boys
and girls were of similar ages at the time of the abuse, t
(98) = .59, p = .56. Offenders’ average age at onset was
31.91 years old (SD  = 14.14, range  = 11–79. Almost
all (90%) participants reported that they first sexually
abused a child when they were an adult.
Relationship context
Over half of the sample (53%) reported a familial first
victim and just under half (47%) a non-familial first vic-
tim (including 6% stranger-onset). Of those who had a
prior relationship with the victim (n  = 94), the major-
ity of offenders (66%) had known their victims for more
than 1 year prior to the first abuse incident and one-third
(34%) had established relationships with the victims but
for less than 1 year. The most common familial victims
were step-children (25%) or biological children (13%).
The most common nonfamilial victims were children of
friends (13%), neighbours (7%) or children met through
work (7%).
Procedure
In line with ethical protocols stipulated by the cor-
rectional centre and from the researchers’ Uni-
versity ethics committee, corrections staff initially
approached offenders and invited them to participate
in the study. Those who consented were then individu-
ally approached by a member of the research team to
complete a detailed self-report questionnaire. Partici-
pants were asked to provide specific details about the 
Offence location
In 80% of incidents the sexual abuse occurred in a domes-
tic setting. Of those abused outside the domestic setting
(n = 20), 3 were abused in an organizational setting and
17 in public.
Offence timing
These incidents most commonly occurred dur-
ing the hours of 3 pm–9 pm (48%),  one-third (34%) 
Page 5

between 6 am and 3 pm and two-fifths (18%) overnight
(9 pm–6 am).
Victim age and the timing and context of the first sexual
abuse incident
To examine our first two questions separate ANOVAs
were conducted to investigate whether differences in
victim age would be observed according to the time at
which the first sexual abuse incident took place and the
relationship context; then separately the timing and loca-
tion of the abuse incident, including any interactions
with gender.
A 2 (relationship context) × 3 (offence timing) ANOVA
revealed a significant main effect for relationship context, 
F (1,100) = 4.98, p = .03, ƞ2 = .05. Familial perpetrators
were more likely to sexually abuse younger-aged children
(M = 9.82 years, SD = 3.38) than were nonfamilial per-
petrators (M = 11.16 years, SD = 3.20). The main effect
for offence timing was also statistically significant, F
(1,100) = 10.38, p < .001, ƞ2 = .18. Post-hoc comparisons
using the Tukey HSD test indicated that younger-aged
children (M  = 8.83,  SD  = 3.81) were sexually abused
between the times of 6 am and 3 pm, ‘middle-aged’ chil-
dren (M = 10.83, SD = 2.85) between 3 pm and 9 pm, and
older children and adolescents (M = 12.61, SD = 1.91) 
between 9 pm and 6 am (Fig. 1). No significant interac-
tion effect was observed, F (1,100) = 0.005, p = .99. 
A second 2 (offence location)  × 3 (offence timing) 
ANOVA yielded no statistically significant main effect
for offence location, F (1,100) = 1.75, p = .19. However, 
a significant main effect for offence timing was found, F
(1,100) = 4.95, p = .009, ƞ2 = .10. No interaction effect
was observed, F (1,100)  = .39, p  = .68. When victim
gender was included in both analyses as an independent
variable, no statistically significant (main or interaction
effects) findings were observed.
Nature of the first sexual abuse incident: victim age
and presence of others
To assess questions 3 and 4, we examined whether the
presence of others was associated with the age of the vic-
tim, relationship of the victim to the offender, types of
sexual acts engaged in and the duration of the abuse inci-
dent, including any interactions with gender.
Sexual acts
Half (53%) of sexual contacts involved penetrative acts. 
The most common sexual acts included the perpetrator
fondling the victims’ bottoms, breasts or genitals (51%);
attempted or completed rape (24%); the perpetrator per-
forming oral sex on the child (23%) or having the child
masturbate them (18%). Other sexual acts included hav-
ing the child perform oral sex on the perpetrator (17%),
masturbating the child (16%); digital penetration (13%);
Fig. 1  Victim age according to relationship context and time of offence.

having the child fondle the perpetrator (10%); having the
child masturbate themselves (5%) and having the child
penetrate the perpetrator (3%)b. Although a higher pro-
portion of penetrative acts occurred in the absence of
others (64%) than when someone was nearby (45%), this
was not statistically significant, χ2 (n  = 99, 1)  = 3.46, 
p = 0.06, ϕ = −.19. The 2 (presence of others) × 2 (pen-
etrative acts) ANOVA yielded no statistically significant
difference in victim age, including when gender was
incorporated.
Presence of others
More than half (60%)  of incidents occurred when
another person (either adult or child) was nearby, but
not close enough to directly witness the incident. For
those incidents that occurred in a home (n = 80), two-
thirds (64%) occurred when someone else was nearby, 
most commonly in another room in the house (44%).
This person was most commonly a child relative (32%)
or an adult relative (22%). In a small number of cases
(12%), someone was present in the same room at the
time of the first sexual abuse incident, the majority of
the individuals (90%) were children, although two par-
ticipants reported the presence of an adult as well. For
incidents that occurred outside the home (n = 20), two-
fifths (40%) occurred in the presence of someone nearby; 
two-thirds (63%) of whom were less than 50 metres
away. These individuals were most commonly child rela-
tives of the perpetrator (17%) or a stranger adult (18%).
A significantly higher proportion of familial incidents
(74%) occurred when others were in close proximity, 
compared to nonfamilial incidents (45%), χ2 (n = 100, 
1) = 8.67, p = 0.003, ϕ = −.29. However, when exam-
ining this in relation to victim age, the 2 (presence of
others) × 2 (relationship context) ANOVA was not sta-
tistically significant.
Duration of contact
Sexual contact with the victim lasted less than 5 min in
the majority (61%) of cases, between 5 and 15 min in
one-fifth (20%) of incidents, and more that 15 min in
the remaining one-fifth (19%) of cases. The presence of
another person nearby appeared to be associated with
the duration of the incident, with over two-thirds (70%)
of incidents lasting less than 5 min when another person
was in close proximity, compared to one-third (29%) last-
ing between 5 and 15 min and two-fifths (22%) of more
than 15 min when no one was nearby. However, this
was not statistically significant, χ2 (n = 100, 3) = 5.27, 
p = 0.07, ϕc
 = .23. The 2 (presence of others) × 3 (dura-
tion) ANOVA did not show statistically significant differ-
ences in victim age or interactions with gender. 
Witnesses
Despite there being others in close proximity (and even
in the same room) to where the abuse occurred, few (8%,
n  = 8) of these incidents were directly witnessed by a
third party. Five of these witnesses were children either
known or related to the perpetrator; and three were
adults known or related to the perpetrator. In all but
one instance (instigated by an adult), no one intervened
during this first abuse incident. In this single instance, 
the perpetrator immediately ceased the behaviour in
response to this intervention.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to examine the character-
istics of the first sexual abuse incident from the routine
activities approach. In particular, we were interested in
exploring how victim age might be linked to the timing, 
context and nature of participants’ first sexual abuse inci-
dents. Overall, our findings indicate that sexual abuse
incidents first tend to occur against children to whom
perpetrators have routine access, in contexts and during
times where the perpetrators and victims are most likely
to be interacting with each other in the milieu of their
usual routines and activities.
Almost all offenders reported that they first sexually
abused a child when they were adults. The average age
of onset was 32 years of age. From the routine activities
perspective, the mean age coincides with males assum-
ing new family-oriented roles (i.e.,  as fathers, stepfa-
thers, uncles) as well as employment-oriented roles (i.e.,
coaches, teachers) that routinely bring them into close
contact with children, thereby increasing their exposure
and access to children, oftentimes unsupervised.
Consistent with previous studies (e.g., Andrews et al. 
2002; Goldman and Padayachi 1997; Putnam 2003) our
findings indicate that the risk for sexual abuse increases
with age. Female children were the most likely victims in
these incidents. Nevertheless, both girls and boys appear
to be initially at risk of abuse within the context of exist-
ing relationships with (potential) perpetrators, rather
than strangers. Most victims were known to the perpe-
trator often having had an established nonsexual relation-
ship with each other prior to abuse. This pattern is similar
to the findings of other studies of child sexual abuse (e.g.,
Andrews et al. 2002; Dube and Hebert 1988; Smallbone
and Wortley 2000) and suggests that individuals tend not
to actively seek out victims for such incidents, at least not
initially. Instead, they first offend against children with
whom they are familiar, a finding which is consistent with
the routine activities approach.
The first sexual abuse incidents occurred predomi-
nantly in domestic settings, regardless of victim age or
Page 7
McKillop et al. Crime Sci (2015) 4:17  Page 7 of 10
gender, and most commonly during the hours where
usual routines and activities place victims and perpetra-
tors in the same locations. From a situational perspec-
tive (Clarke and Cornish 1985; Cornish and Clarke 1986; 
Tewksbury and Mustaine 2010; Wortley and Smallbone
2006) domestic settings provide more routine access to
victims and therefore present the most opportune offence
structure posing the least amount of effort and risk to
offenders. As individuals within these settings tend
to have close, existing relationships with one another, 
this shared ecological space increases their exposure to
(potential) victimization (Smallbone and Cale 2015).
This is particularly so in the case of familial sexual abuse
as the victim-perpetrator relationship, by nature, results
in these interactions occurring frequently in the absence
of other individuals who would otherwise protect or dis-
courage such behaviour, acting as fundamental initiators
of child sexual abuse (Cohen and Felson 1979; Felson
2008; Finkelhor 1984).
Regarding questions one and two, younger children
tended to be sexually abused during the earlier hours of
the day, ‘middle-age’ children during the afternoon and
early evening and older children/adolescents later in the
evening and overnight, regardless of gender. Consistent
with Fischer and McDonald (1998) and Snyder (2000) 
younger children were also more likely to be sexually
abused by familial perpetrators and older children by
nonfamilial perpetrators. Together these findings may
reflect an increase of routines situated outside the family
as children age (e.g., during school and after-school rec-
reational activities), compared with younger (non-school
age) children whose routines more closely connected to
the family. For adolescent victims the timing of abuse
may coincide within interactions with their caregivers in
the home (e.g., homework, watching TV, bedtime) and, 
for others, individuals outside the home (e.g., sleep over
at friend’s house; at a party; walking home). Thus, the
timing and context of these incidents may be shaped, to
some extent, by children’s age-related victim routines and
activities and indicates that risk factors for sexual abuse
at earlier stages in children’s lives may be quite differ-
ent to those associated with later developmental stages. 
Accordingly, prevention efforts need to be responsive
to lifestyle patterns associated with the developmental
stages of childhood.
This convergence, however, still tended to occur within
(familial or nonfamilial) domestic settings, regardless
of age. As such, prevention approaches must target this
setting. There already exists a repertoire of offender-cen-
tred and child-focussed approaches to the prevention of
child sexual abuse. These findings emphasize the need
to extend this individual focus to include creating safer
relationships and environments (formally and informally) 
in addition to safer individuals. Essentially such interven-
tions should be aimed at reducing opportunities to com-
mit crime in the social ecologies and routines of everyday
living (Clarke 1992, 2008; Cornish and Clarke 2003), with
a focus on the pre-offence and offence settings situated
within the social and physical environments of potential
victims and perpetrators (Smallbone et al. 2008).
Our initial assumption when carrying out this study
was that any individual, regardless of age, could act as a
potential guardian whose presence alone has the poten-
tial to deter individual from engaging in sexual abuse. 
We assumed that this would be particularly influential in
the decision-making of individuals at the onset of their
offending (rather than during subsequent offences), yet
our results suggest otherwise. The majority of incidents
occurred when another person was nearby, but not close
enough to directly witness the incident. Again, this was
regardless of victim age or gender. Similar to the findings
of Underwood et al. (1999), this suggests that, in many
cases, perpetrators were largely unconcerned about the
risk of detection, particularly within familial contexts. 
That is, the mere presence of someone close by (and even
in the same room) did not necessarily act as a deterrent
in the decision to initiate abuse. This presence did appear
to impact somewhat on the intrusiveness and duration of
the incident, but not significantly so. Despite there being
others in close proximity (and even in the same room) 
where the abuse occurred, few of these incidents were
directly witnessed by a third party. In all but one instance
(instigated by an adult), no one intervened during this
first abuse incident.
Overall, these findings highlight two important issues. 
First, from both a theoretical and practical perspective, it
raises questions as to whether children can actually con-
stitute capable guardians in these types of crimes, and
whether in fact, this is a key consideration in perpetrator
decision-making, even in the first instance of abuse. Sec-
ond, it raises questions as to whether the typical context
in which these incidents occur (domestic settings and
among known individuals), compromises capable guardi-
anship, even in adults. Some insights can be drawn from
Reynald’s (2010) work in this regard.
First, in relation to children constituting potential
guardians, Reynald (2010) discussed three components
of capable guardianship, particularly within micro-spaces
such as domestic settings: (1) willingness to supervise, (2) 
ability to detect potential offending; and, (3) willingness
to intervene when necessary. Most prevention strate-
gies to date have focussed predominantly on the second
component, through education (e.g. protective behav-
iours) and awareness programs generally designed to
increase knowledge and detection of potential abusive
situations. While there is evidence for the acquisition
Page 8
McKillop et al. Crime Sci (2015) 4:17  Page 8 of 10
of such knowledge to prepare adults and children alike, 
the evidence remains limited regarding whether this
translates into action (Finkelhor 2009). Furthermore, the
components of willingness to supervise and intervene
implies equality within the relationships of the perpetra-
tor and guardian, which, as the current findings suggest, 
is oftentimes not the case in these incidents. Thus, the
developmental (e.g., emotional and physical) vulnerabili-
ties synonymous with childhood, likely diminishes these
capabilities in children. This is likely a key consideration
in offender decision-making, reducing the deterrence
effect both in initiating the abuse, and for some, persist-
ing with abuse even when witnessed, and from as early
on as the first incident. Details of the ages of the chil-
dren who were present were not available for this study. 
Studies on guardianship involving other types of crime
often use a measure of age of 16 or over (e.g., Miethe and
Meier 1994), perhaps for these reasons. These age-related
dynamics require further exploration in the context of
sexual abuse.
Second, the question becomes whether the dynamics
of the relationship between the victim, perpetrator and
potential guardian/s adds a layer of complexity to the
situation that might alter or compromise guardianship
potential, regardless of age. These complexities are not
often present in other types of crimes where the routine
activities approach has been applied. For example, often-
times the perpetrator is a loved and trusted person of the
guardian and/or child. This has implications for both the
level of supervision and willingness to intervene. This is
particularly so in the case of established, trusting care-
giving relationships where many of the incidents occur
in the context of innocuous, even positive parent–child
routine interactions (e.g., bathing, putting to bed, com-
forting child). Active supervision is relaxed within such
environments, and where inadvertently interrupted, can
be more readily concealed, reducing capacities for detec-
tion and intervention. This dynamics are also likely to
lower perpetrators’ perceptions of risk in such contexts. 
The dependence of the relationship between perpetra-
tors and potential guardians (especially those involving
close emotional bonds) might compromise willingness
to intervene or disclose due to the anticipated conse-
quences of such action (e.g. loss of relationship, family
breakdown, removal of perpetrator from home, financial
loss), thereby promoting inaction on the part of some
guardians in this context. The complexities underlying
the conceptualisation of guardianship in these contexts
therefore need to be a point of focus for clarification in
the academic field, to determine how useful its applica-
tion, and that of the routine activities approach, can be to
the prevention of child sexual abuse. 
While these findings are informative, they should
be regarded within the limitations of the study. First, 
the sample size was modest, and may have compro-
mised statistical power, thereby increasing possibility
of Type II error (failure to detect actual differences).
The sample was also drawn from a population of con-
victed sexual offenders, which limits the generaliz-
ability of findings from this study to all contact sexual
abuse incidents. We also did not assess whether this
first known contact sexual abuse incident was pre-
dated by any non-contact sexual abuse incidents, such
as voyeurism or viewing child abuse images online. It
is assumed that at least some of the sample may have
engaged in this behaviour prior to engaging in contact
sexual abuse. Second, although we purposely recruited
a nonclinical sample, and applied strict confidentiality
and anonymity provisions for participants, there are
still the usual challenges regarding retrospective sex
offender self-report data (Wood and Riggs 2009; Tan
and Grace 2008). Third, this study focussed on the first
contact sexual abuse incident and so it is not possible
to ascertain if the patterns identified apply to other
sexual abuse incidents beyond this initial offence. Feld-
man (1977) distinguished between factors that lead to
the initial offence and factors that maintain the behav-
iour in the current environment and there remains
the question regarding how situational factors (and
routine activities) influence not only the onset offence
but offence progression as well. Given that there are
still very few empirical investigations of situational
dimensions of sexual abuse incidents, we encourage
further studies employing larger sample sizes, includ-
ing community-based samples, which examine the
onset and progression of sexual offending incidents
from the routine activities perspective. Fourth, it was
not possible from the data to establish whether or not
any of the adult witnesses were active participants or
facilitators in the first the sexual contact incident. This
information would add another critical element to the
understanding of guardianship within this context and
should be a focus of future research. Finally, virtu-
ally all men encounter these opportunities, but most, 
it is assumed, do not sexually abuse. This requires an
extension beyond mainstream criminological theory to
include an understanding the person-situation interac-
tion model of human behavior (Mischel 1968; Wort-
ley 2012). Future studies that apply this framework to
examine how dispositions or vulnerabilities of individ-
uals interact with specific situational factors to facili-
tate sexual offences are encouraged. This will provide a
more complete account of how sexual abuse incidents
first, and subsequently, unfold.

Conclusions
Overall, our findings add to our understanding of the situ-
ational and contextual factors involved in the perpetra-
tion of contact child sexual abuse and demonstrate, more
broadly, the utility of situational crime prevention models
for explaining where, when and how child sexual abuse
incidents first occur. In particular, these findings indicate
that the timing and context of sexual abuse incidents may
be influenced by age-related routine activities that define
convergence settings and opportunity structures. How-
ever, these abuse incidents still tend to occur in a domestic
setting, regardless of age or gender, making this setting a
key target area for prevention. The findings also highlight
the complexities involved in conceptualizing guardianship
within the context of child sexual abuse, particularly when
close, emotional bonds exist between individuals. Further
theoretical and empirical exploration of the key dimen-
sions that underpin capable guardianship for this type of
crime is therefore warranted, to determine whether, and
how, situational approaches can assist in understanding
and preventing child sexual abuse.
