Abstract 
This study aimed to examine the association between different characteristics of sexual abuse and adverse family
outcomes in later life. Through archived court files, a large sample of Dutch men and women who have been sexually
abused as a child could be identified. Outcome variables were assessed 33 years after the abuse, when the victims
were 44 years of age on average. Being abused by a nuclear family member was associated with teen pregnancies, 
young marriage, and divorce. Younger ages at time of abuse were related to decreased marriage rates. Penetration, 
violence, and repeated victimization were not related to adverse outcomes. We found that these effects were not the
same for males and females. Furthermore, compared to the average Dutch population, CSA victims experienced more
divorce, and female CSA victims were more often childless, had more children, and more often were teenage parents.

Background
Child sexual abuse (CSA) can be a traumatizing event. 
Research has shown that victims generally have less posi-
tive outcomes as they transition to adulthood than non-
victims, on numerous domains (de Jong et al. 2015). CSA
victims have worse physical health (e.g., Irish et al. 2010),
have more sexual problems (e.g., Senn et al. 2008; Neu-
mann et al. 1996), suffer more often from depression or
posttraumatic stress disorder (Paolucci et al. 2001; Neu-
mann et al. 1996; Jumper 1995; Chen et al. 2010), and
have lower self-esteem (Jumper 1995) than those not
sexually abused as a child. Although supported by less
extensive empirical evidence, CSA victims as compared
to non-victims are also likely to attain lower educational
levels (Hyman 2000; Alexander et al. 2000; Peleikis et al. 
2005), have lower incomes (Hyman 2000; Roberts et al. 
2004; Barrett et al. 2014), are more likely to be arrested in
adulthood (Siegel and Williams 2003; Widom and Ames
1994), and are more likely to experience relationship vio-
lence (Noll et al. 2009), divorce or separation (Fleming
et al. 1999; Colman and Widom 2004; Nelson et al. 2002; 
Mullen et al. 1994; Whisman 2006), and teen parenthood
(Roberts et al. 2004; Schilling et al. 2007; Anda et al. 2001; 
Noll et al. 2009; Woodward et al. 2001; Mullen et al. 1994;

Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands 
Friesen et al. 2010). As such, CSA appears to have a per-
vasive negative influence in victims’ lives.
However, there are two caveats to these findings. First, 
some authors have stressed that differences between
victims and non-victims may not be solely attributable
to the sexual victimization, but may at least partly be
explained by underlying characteristics on which victims
and non-victims differ as well. For example, Rind et al. 
(1998) found that while CSA victims were psychologi-
cally less adjusted than controls, this effect was largely
explained by family factors, such as neglect, family struc-
ture, or traditionalism. A meta-analysis on college sam-
ples supported this conclusion (Rind and Tromovitch
1997). Studies that are able to ‘isolate’ the effect of child
sexual abuse in a methodological sense are for obvious
reasons very hard to conduct, as perpetrators may be
expected to select victims in a non-random fashion from
the population.
Second, the nature of sexual victimization is probably
a significant moderating factor. Not all kinds of sexual
abuse are likely to have similar life-long negative impact, 
and in fact there are indications that the more intrusive
or aggressive the abuse was, the severer the consequences
are. For instance, a variety of studies have shown more
invasive forms of sexual abuse (e.g., penetration) to be
most strongly related to lower relationship quality (Whis-
man 2006; Mullen et al. 1994; Friesen et al. 2010; Feinauer
et al. 1996), more interpersonal violence (Fleming et al.

1999), more adverse educational outcomes (Mullen et al. 
1994; Boden et al. 2007), more sexual problems (Fleming
et al. 1999; Mullen et al. 1994), and increased risk of teen-
age pregnancies (Friesen et al. 2010; Mullen et al. 1994).
Also, closer ties to the perpetrator have been found to
strongly affect employment outcomes (Hyman 2000), and
increase chances of interpersonal violence in later rela-
tionships (Yoshihama and Horrocks 2010). In addition, 
abuse with multiple occurrences was found to increase
chances of interpersonal violence (Yoshihama and Hor-
rocks 2010).  Finally, abuse occurring at a young age
(before age 11) and abuse involving threats or actual vio-
lence, have been found to be related to an increased risk
of teenage pregnancies (Anda et al. 2001). Besides these
characteristics, the gender of the victim is found to be a
moderating factor. For instance, CSA has been associated
with a lower quality of romantic relationships for female
victims, while this was not found for male victims (Col-
man and Widom 2004). In addition, the effect of CSA on
physical interpersonal violence was smaller for females
than for males (Luo et al. 2008; Afifi et al. 2009). A strong
link between CSA and adverse economic consequences
was found for male victims, while such effects were not
found for female victims (Barrett et al. 2014). However, 
the effect of gender is not consistent. For instance, Col-
man and Widom (2004) found a larger effect of CSA on
divorce for abused males than for abused females, while
Nelson et al. (2002) found the opposite to be true. Thus, 
although the characteristics of the abuse and the gender
of the victim seem to matter findings from studies that
investigated the differential impact of various kinds and
settings of child sexual abuse have also generated incon-
clusive results, likely partly because of differences in
study designs and operationalizations. Studies that do
investigate the difference in impact of various types of
CSA in a systematic manner are rare.
This study aims to add to the literature in two ways. We
study CSA victim outcomes in the following domains: 
marriage, divorce, and teen parenthood. Our first and
main objective is to compare these outcomes by the
nature of the sexual abuse. In particular, we will study
whether outcomes differ by the nature of the sexual
victimization per se (penetration versus other types of
abuse), the presence of violence or threats of violence, 
repeatedness of the abuse, victim’s gender and age, and
the victim’s relationship with the perpetrator(s). In doing
so, we use validated data on sexual abuse from court
records that we match with data from the Municipal Pop-
ulation Register on marriage, divorce and parenthood. As
such, we have no loss to follow-up and our data are liable
to recall issues to a very limited extent only. In addition
to this main objective, we will gauge outcomes against
those of average Dutch citizens, where possible. 
Definition of child sexual abuse
Varying definitions of CSA are used in the literature. 
Most researchers agree that physical contact with a child
in a sexually coercive situation constitutes CSA. While
some authors also include non-contact behavior in their
definition of CSA, we only include CSA with contact. 
Such contact may range from touching body parts inap-
propriately to genital penetration. This way we focus on a
clearly delineated, relatively homogeneous set of sexually
abusive behavior.
Different authors also use different age limits for the
victim. Some authors use an age limit of 12 years, others
16 years (e.g., Mullen et al. 1994), others yet use 18 years
as a cutoff. We chose 18 years as a cutoff age because
persons under 18 are considered minors in the Neth-
erlands. All sexual acts with persons below 16 years of
age constitute a crime in the Netherlands. From 16 years
they constitute a crime if force was used, or if the vic-
tim cannot be considered to have been able to freely
consent to the sexual acts, such as in a doctor–patient
relationship.
Method
Sample
Our sample consisted of 910 victims of child sexual
abuse. Victims were sampled as follows. We extracted
criminal court files from all jurisdictions in the Nether-
lands where criminal court files from the years 1980–
1985 have been archived.1 These are 14 jurisdictions: 
Alkmaar, Almelo, Amsterdam, Assen, Breda, Dordrecht, 
The Hague, Groningen, ‘s-Hertogenbosch, Leeuwarden, 
Middelburg, Rotterdam, Utrecht, and Zwolle. In these
years studied, the Netherlands had 19 distinct jurisdic-
tions, and we secured access to the files of 14. The sam-
pled jurisdictions cover both large cities as well as rural
areas, and, based on what is known about these jurisdic-
tions, do not differ in the manner in which the police
dealt with sexual abuse cases, prosecutorial policies or
the manner in which criminal cases were dispositioned in
the different courts from other jurisdictions. We there-
fore consider our sample to be representative for the
Netherlands for that period.
From the searched archives all files containing at least
one sex offense were analyzed. Next, these cases had to
meet three criteria to be included in our study. First, 
the victim had to be under the age of 18. Second, the
abuse had to constitute hands-on sexual abuse. Third, 
the perpetrator had to have been proclaimed guilty of
1  Permission for study was obtained from the Central Prosecutor’s Office, 
the Dutch Council for the Judiciary, each particular archive that held court
records, and the Bureau Registratie Persoongegevens that holds the GBA
register data. Ethics clearance was obtained from the Ethics Committee of
the Faculty of Law (CERCO) of the VU University Amsterdam.

the abuse, meaning that a judge found the sexual abuse
proven. As the Netherlands does not have plea-bargain-
ing, we therefore assume for all cases we selected that
the perpetrator committed the sexual abuse against the
victim.
Given the date the register data was searched, victims
were on average 44 years at the end of observation. Of all
victims, 3.6 % were deceased and 3.23 % had emigrated
out of the Netherlands. However, this is likely to be an
under-registration, as such events happening before the
introduction of the Municipal Population Register in
1994 prevent persons from being included in our study. 
For these victims the observation period ended at the age
they died or emigrated. All in all, the youngest age at the
end of observation in our sample was 18; the oldest age
was 57.
Sexual abuse variables
The information present in the criminal court files varied
across jurisdictions. While courts are required by law to
destroy certain parts of the files after a statutory period
of 20 years (such as police transcripts and photographed
evidence) and archive the remaining ‘trimmed’ file, they
are also by law required to preserve at least some docu-
ments (such as the document with the charges and the
verdict). In practice, many courts are lagging behind in
the removal of parts of the court files and we therefore
often found documents that were still present such as
detailed accounts of the examination in court, or files on
the police investigation such as transcriptions of hearings
of perpetrators or victims.
From the court files, we coded the following character-
istics if they were available: nature of the abuse, in case of
repeated abuse we coded the period in which the abuse
took place as well as the estimated number of times the
abuse had occurred, circumstances of the abuse, rela-
tionship of the perpetrator(s) to the victim(s), as well as
victim and perpetrator name and demographics. Some
victims had been abused in one situation by multiple
perpetrators, others had been abused in multiple situa-
tions by different perpetrators; in such cases victims may
have suffered different types of abuse (e.g., fondling in
one situation and rape in another situation), the relation-
ship with the perpetrator may vary (one perpetrator may
have been a classmate, another perpetrator the father),
and the victim’s age may vary as well. This pertained to
20 % of victims, and in such cases we noted that victims
were abused multiple times, and we coded the presum-
ably most ‘intrusive’ or serious entry of each characteris-
tic across all situations as pertaining to that victim (e.g.,
‘rape’ over ‘fondling’,  ‘father’ over ‘classmate’,  and age
8 over age 17). While this is done to prevent statistical 
complications due to victims appearing multiple times, 
this solution has obvious disadvantages as it entails loss
of information.
Outcome variables
Data on marriage, divorce, and children were obtained
from the Dutch Municipal Population Register (com-
monly abbreviated to GBA in Dutch). This register was
established in 1994 and is a complete registration of all
Dutch citizens as well as all non-Dutch individuals offi-
cially residing in the Netherlands. It also contains his-
torical data, so individuals who died or emigrated since
1994 are retrievable as well. It contains, among other
things, demographic information such as date of birth, 
information on parents, dates of marriage and registered
partnerships (that have the same legal status as mar-
riage in the Netherlands), dates of divorce and relation-
ship dissolution, and full demographic information on
children born to persons registered. It does not include
information on cohabitation. It should be noted that
while children born to unmarried couples are almost
always registered with their biological mother, for a
father this occurs only if he officially acknowledges the
child as his.
Matching procedure
For matching purposes, we noted from the court files
each victim’s family name, full birth names and date and
place of birth if present. Some courts—as a standard—
noted only family names and initials, and not all noted
the date or place of birth of victims. Next, we used the
identifying demographic information (full names, date
and place of birth) to match the sexual abuse variables
to the demographic outcome variables in the GBA. We
matched records automatically at first. Next, we hand
searched the register in case one name turned up mul-
tiple matches, or in cases where no match was returned
at all. There were several possible reasons for the fail-
ure to find a match. For victims who had more common
family names, matches could not always be ascertained. 
In addition, some court files contained incomplete
demographic information, which made it harder to
find a match. In other cases it may have been that per-
sons never lived in the Netherlands, persons died or
emigrated before 1994, or it may also have been that a
spelling error was made in the registered names in the
court files. It is theoretically possible that a person under
the given name is living in the Netherlands but unreg-
istered. This is however highly unlikely; coverage of the
register is extremely good, in part because a registration
is needed for many official acts such as filing out a tax
statement.

We are not able to say exactly for how many victims
we were unable to find a matching register record
because people may be registered in different court
cases under slightly different names. For example, if
a victim is registered as C. Maas (a fictional, common
family name), and in another court case there is a vic-
tim registered as C.P. Maas, and for neither a match
could be found, we cannot be sure whether C. Maas
and C.P. Maas are the same person, and we therefore
miss a match for one victim, or whether they are dif-
ferent persons and we are thus unable to find a match-
ing record for two victims. Therefore, we summarize
the matching outcome as follows: for 1592 court file
records we were able to find 1003 matching victims. 
Some victims appeared in multiple court files. The
1003 victims constituted a sample of 910 unique vic-
tims. After matching, identifying information was
removed and victims were labeled with a number cho-
sen by the researchers.
Analysis
Independent samples t tests and Mann–Whitney U
tests were used to assess whether there was a difference
in abuse characteristics between males and females. 
T tests were used when the test variable was continu-
ous, which was only the case for age of the victim. Dif-
ferences in other abuse characteristics were tested
using Mann–Whitney U tests, as these variables were
categorical.
Next, we tested the extent to which family outcomes
(teen pregnancy, whether sample members ever married, 
whether sample members married very young, and
whether those who married ever divorced) were related
to the sexual abuse characteristics using logistic regres-
sion analyses. We employed multivariate models, because
we expected many of the characteristics of the abuse to
be interrelated. We performed these analyses both for the
entire sample as well as for male and female victims sepa-
rately. As some categories of variables were sparsely
filled, we recoded a number of variables to fewer catego-
ries. In particular, we recoded age of victim into four cat-
egories (0–4, roughly the period before children form
memories; 5–11, age at elementary school; 12–16, 
puberty; 17–18, late adolescence). This allowed us to also
examine a possible non-linear effect of age. Furthermore, 
the use of violence was recoded into a categorical varia-
ble indicating whether or not actual violence had been
employed by the perpetrator, or the abuse involved
threats of violence that did not lead to actual violence. 
The relationship of the victim to the perpetrator was
coded into three categories (victim’s nuclear family; 
acquaintances, friends, or non-nuclear family members; 
and strangers).  Because there was a large number of 
missing data, we decided to include an additional cate-
gory ‘unknown’.2 Finally, we recoded the nature of the
sexual abuse into three categories (non-genital sexual
contact; genital sexual contact; and penetration).
In the logistic regression analysis we included the fol-
lowing predictors: severity of the abuse, violence during
the abuse, and repeated abuse. Additionally, we added
two predictors as categorical variables: the victim’s age
and the relationship to the perpetrator. For age of the
victim we used the youngest age group as the refer-
ence group. All the categories of the relationship to the
offender were contrasted to the nuclear family. We did an
additional survival analysis to test if early marriage and
divorce were interrelated. We used duration of the mar-
riage as the time variable and divorce as status variable. 
The predictors in the model were similar to that of the
logistic regression analysis.
We employed a standard significance level of 5 %, and
tested two-sided, unless we had grounds to expect rela-
tionships to lie in one direction. The latter was the case
for the relationship to the perpetrator (where we expected
victims who have been abused by a nuclear family mem-
ber to be at greater risk for negative outcomes), use of
force (where we expected victims who suffered physical
violence to be at greater risk of negative outcomes), the
severity of the abuse (where we expected victims who
experienced genital touching and penetration, respec-
tively, to be at increased risk of negative outcomes) and
repeated abuse (where we expected victims who suffered
repeated sexual abuse to be at greater risk of negative out-
comes) (see, for instance, Beitchman et al. 1992).
Results
Sample
The sample was comprised of 910 victims, of which
73.8 % were female. Victims’ abuse started on average at
age 12, with the youngest victim being 2 years and the
oldest being 17 years old at the time of the abuse. At the
end of the observation period, victims were on average
44 years old (range 18–57).
A summary of the abuse characteristics is presented
in Table 1. The majority of the victims (56.9 %) expe-
rienced penetration during the abuse, of which 25.1 % 
consisted of solely oral penetration, 67.1 % consisted
(also) of genital penetration, and 7.8 % involved (also) 
anal penetration. Unfortunately, in many cases (43.5 %)
there was no mention of the relationship between

riage of the highest age group for women did not). These analyses are not
reported in this paper.

victim and offender. A little over half of the abuse cases
concerned a single abuse situation; 46.3 % of victims
had been abused multiple times or by multiple perpe-
trators. This could range from being abused twice to
being abused repeatedly over several years.
Gender
Abuse characteristics for male and female victims sepa-
rately are also presented in Table 1. Male victims were
on average somewhat younger at the time of the abuse
than females (10.9 vs. 11.9 years old, t(529,415) = −4.25, 
p < .001). None of the male victims experienced non-gen-
ital fondling, while 5.2 % of female victims did. Genital
contact without penetration was experienced by 49.2 % 
of the male and by 35.7 % of female victims. Penetration
occurred in 50.8 % of male victims and 59.1 % of female
victims. However, these differences were not significant. 
Differences in the relationship with the abuser were sig-
nificant (Z = −6.57, p < .001), with female victims more
often being abused by a family member (26.3 vs. 7.6 %)
or a stranger (10.1 vs. 15.9 %). Also, for female victims
the relationship to their abuser remained more often
unknown (60.1 vs. 37.6 %). In addition, significantly more
male victims were abused multiple times than female vic-
tims (63.3 vs. 40.9 %, Z = −5.43, p < .001). Interestingly, 
male victims were far less likely to experience violence
during their abuse than female victims were (12.6 vs. 
34.7 %, Z = −6.93, p < .001).
Outcomes
Most victims had at least one child (74.2 %); they had
1.8 children on average (SD  = 1.5). Of the female vic-
tims, 19.6 % were childless, and they had 2.0 children on
average (SD = 1.5), both of which are somewhat higher
compared to the average Dutch woman from their birth
cohort (17.6 % and 1.76, respectively) (Statistics Neth-
erlands 2014c). On average, victims were 27.3 years old
when they became a parent (SD = 5.6), ranging from 15
to 49 years. Female victims gave birth to their first child
at an average age of 26.5 (SD  = 5.2), which is 3 years
younger than the average Dutch woman in the same birth
cohort (Statistics Netherlands 2014c). 6.4 % of all victims
became a parent during their teens. However, teenage
parenthood for female victims was 8.2 %, while for men
this was much lower at 1.3 %. This rate for female victims
is four times as high as that of women in the general pop-
ulation (Statistics Netherlands 2014a). Comparable data
on number of children and parenthood for men were
unavailable at Statistics Netherlands.
The majority of the victims married at least once (66.2 %),
and they were on average 27.1 years old at the time of their
first marriage (SD = 6.4). Many married young: at 21 years
of age, 16 % had already been married at least once. How-
ever, almost half of the ever-married sample members also
divorced at least once (47.3 %), a rate that is also noticeably
higher than the divorce rate of 36 % found in the general
population (Statistics Netherlands 2014b).
Relationship of sexual abuse characteristics with outcomes
Teenage parenthood3
For the entire sample of victims, only the victims’ rela-
tionship with the offender was related to teenage par-
enthood (see Table 2). Individuals who were abused by
a nuclear family member were 3–12 times more likely to
become a teenage parent than victims who were abused
by other perpetrators. Age at abuse, severity of the abuse, 
violence during the abuse, and repeated abuse were not
related to teenage parenthood. For female victims the
findings were comparable with those of the total sample
of victims. For male victims, the model could not be esti-
mated, because only three men became a parent during
their teens.
Marriage
While not marrying is not necessarily a negative out-
come, marriage may be regarded as part of a conventional

life path. For the entire sample of victims, whether or not
they ever married was not affected by the relationship
to the offender (see Table 3). Only age at the abuse was
related to the likelihood to marry. Compared to those
abused during the first 4 years in life, older victims were
two to three times more likely to get married. The effect
size increased for each consecutive age group, suggesting
that the older victims were at the time of abuse, the more
likely they were to get married. Severity of the abuse, 
violence, and repeated abuse were not related to having
been married. When disaggregating by sex, for male vic-
tims the effect of age disappeared, but for female victims
the effect remained significant.
Looking at early marriage (i.e.,  marriage before age
21) specifically, we only found an effect of the relation-
ship to the offender: abuse by a nuclear family member, 
as opposed to the perpetrator being a stranger, increased
the odds of early marriage (OR  = 3.39, p < .05) (see
Table 4). While we previously found age at the abuse to 
be associated with marriage, it was not related to early 
marriage. Also, we did not find an effect of severity of
the abuse, violence during the abuse, or repeated abuse. 
When disaggregating by sex, for female victims the
effect of relationship to the offender remained significant
(OR = 2.89, p < .05). Again, for male victims, the model
could not be estimated due to the small number of men
who had married before age 21. 
Divorce
Lastly, for those victims who had ever married, chances of
divorce turned out to be affected only by the relationship
to the offender (see Table 5). Divorce occurred less often
among victims of stranger abuse compared to victims of
abuse by a nuclear family member (OR = 0.39, p < .01).
Age at abuse, severity of the abuse, violence during the
abuse, and repeated abuse were not related to divorce. 
Separate analyses for male victims did not yield significant
results, suggesting that males’ chances of divorce were not
affected by the studied abuse characteristics. However, 
for female victims the effect of stranger perpetrators held
(OR = 0.348, p < .01), and an additional effect of violence
during the abuse was found (OR = 1.22, p < .10).
It could however be the case, that effects found for
divorce were actually due to the fact that divorce may
have been more likely in those who marry early, as they
had a lengthier ‘exposure period’. We tested this using
Cox regression, which allowed us to control for cen-
soring: using this technique we investigated the dura-
tion to divorce in all those who ever married, using the
same predictor variables. Based on this analysis, we con-
cluded that divorce occurred less often among victims
abused by a stranger compared to nuclear family member
(OR = 0.61, p < 0.10), even though the effect was only
significant tested one-sided. Thus, the effect of the rela-
tionship to the abuser on divorce, while reduced in size, 
remained.

Discussion
We found that female victims of CSA compared unfa-
vorably to average Dutch women of their birth cohort; 
they had an elevated risk of teenage pregnancies and
divorce. Female victims also had higher rates of early
marriage, and remained somewhat more often unmar-
ried than average. Furthermore, they tended to remain
more often childless than the average Dutch female. 
However, if they had children they had slightly more chil-
dren than average. Although we have to be careful when
interpreting these findings due to the lack of a matched
control group, these findings are in line with the litera-
ture on victims of CSA regarding teenage pregnancies, 
divorce, parenthood (Peleikis et al. 2005), and number
of children (Noll et al. 2009; DiLillo et al. 2000). Obvi-
ously, due to the lack of a control group, it is impossible
to attribute these characteristics to the sample members’ 
CSA victimization. For most outcome measures, we had
no comparison data for male victims.
Second, we investigated to what extent characteristics
of the sexual abuse were related to any of these outcomes. 
As many of the characteristics of the abuse were interre-
lated (with younger victims for instance less often suffer-
ing violence and penetration), we employed multivariate
models. We found that being abused by a nuclear family
member, as compared to other types of perpetrators, pre-
dicted teen pregnancies. Contrary to what was expected
based on previous research we did not find an effect on
teenage parenthood of penetration, the abuse occurring
before age 11, or the presence of violence. We further
found being abused by a nuclear family member to be
related to early marriage and divorce, and being abused at
younger ages to be related to a lower likelihood to marry. 
In addition, for female victims, violence during the abuse
was related to higher risk of divorce.
We discuss three pertinent issues with regard to these
findings. First, we did not find effects on all dependent
variables. This could be due to the analysis being under-
powered: some of the outcomes were rare events, and
some categories of independent variables sparsely filled, 
especially for the smaller subgroup of male victims. There
may also be heterogeneity in effects for subgroups we
did not distinguish. For instance, much may depend on
whether victims received adequate care after the abuse, 
which was information we did not have. More research
here is needed. Some of our (absence of) findings do not
match those in the literature. Given that some abuse char-
acteristics are interrelated, our multivariate models will
have allowed only the unique contributions of variables
to emerge. Also, de Jong et al. (2015) previously reported
that CSA appears to be associated with the quality of
adult roles rather than the transition to these roles per se. 
Therefore, it is possible that abuse characteristics affect

the quality of marriage and parenthood more than enter-
ing into marriage or having children per se.
Second, even though for a number of outcomes a
model for male victims could not be estimated, for
some measures we did find different effects for male and
female victims. This is in line with the literature, which
has reported that effects might be gendered (Colman and
Widom 2004; Nelson et al. 2002).
Third, we found that, across the board, the ‘relational
setting’ of the sexual victimization rather than its vio-
lence, serious or repeated nature was related to negative
outcomes. Thus, it was whether sexual violence was per-
petrated by a person to whom the victim is close, or in
a relationship of dependence (such as a father or stepfa-
ther), or whether that victimization occurred when the
victim was still young and much more dependent on
adult (parental) help and support, that impacted on out-
comes, more than the specific nature of the abuse. Why
that is the case is a matter for further investigation. A
possible explanation could be that boys and girls who are
victimized by their nuclear family members may want to
escape from the family home, either to avoid the perpe-
trator or to try and leave behind a dysfunctional family
that may have led to the abuse in the first place. In try-
ing to do so, they may make the transition to starting a
family for themselves or marrying in a sense ‘too’ young, 
which in turn increases the risk for divorce later on. Sup-
port for this may be found in the fact that the relationship
to the perpetrator was not related to marriage in general, 
but was related to early marriage. Another explanation
may be the breaking of trust that abuse by a nuclear fam-
ily member, which is often a father, may incur—especially
for young victims—attachment problems. This may lead
to victims distrusting men or their partners, leading to
dysfunctional relationships. In addition, when a father
is the abuser, victims lose a person they would possibly
otherwise go to for help; it may thus be that victims of
intra-familial abuse received less support and care after
the abuse. In that case, it may actually be the lack of sup-
port that drives the association, rather than the abuse per
se. It is also possible that a third variable explains both
the abuse and the adverse family outcomes, such as fam-
ily or neighborhood characteristics. Support for this may
be found in the finding that especially abuse within the
family, which could be a marker for family disadvantage, 
is associated with adverse outcomes. Research with tai-
lored comparison groups is needed here.
Our design has a number of strengths and weaknesses. 
While the use of court records is a strong feature of this
study, because they are marred less from subjectivity and
memory issues than most retrospective methods, it has
shortcomings as well. With sexual abuse rarely reported 
to the police, and reported cases not often resulting in
conviction, we are likely to have missed out on a large
proportion of sexual abuse cases. While our sample of
child sexual abuse cases is representative of Dutch court
proceedings on sexual crimes, it is likely not representa-
tive of all occurrences of child sexual abuse. Particu-
lar kinds of abuse are more likely to be reported to the
police and to be prosecuted and end up in conviction. 
Based on the available literature, these are more often
cases of stranger abuse and more serious kinds of abuse
(Cross et al. 1994; Stroud et al. 2000). In addition, the
use of register data, while attractive because of its com-
plete coverage, objectivity and precision, has disadvan-
tages too. First, information on cohabitation and dating
relationships was not available. Second, while almost all
mothers are known to officially register their biological
children, it is well known that for biological fathers this
occurs less often. Thus, more male victims in our data
will have fathered (and cared for) children than we were
able to see. Another limitation of this research is the lack
of information on possible confounding variables, such as
socioeconomic status of the victims, family dynamics, or
neighborhood disadvantages.
Our research has distinct strengths too, for instance, 
the use of independently assessed sexual abuse informa-
tion from the court files. Use of these files also implied
that information on the abuse had been collected and
stored, and did not have to be retrieved from memory
when the study was conducted. Thus, even though some
memory loss may have occurred when the court files
were compiled, this is arguably likely to be considerably
less than if the same information would have been col-
lected retrospectively. A second strength is that, by using
the judge’s verdict to determine the severity of the abuse, 
this severity was determined more objectively than when
only the narrative of the victim would have been used. 
While the victim’s testimony is an important part of the
evidence, and is therefore often still the basis for which
facts are found to be proven, a judge will investigate
more facts that can or cannot support the claims. Third, 
through the use of archived court files, we were able to
follow up victims for a very long time, on average around
33 years. At the time of outcome assessment, victims
were on average 44 years old, thus in mid-life. Their rel-
atively high average age, an age where most women are
past childbearing age, and most of those who marry will
have done so, enables us to assess the aftermath of differ-
ent kinds of sexual abuse in terms of marriage, childbear-
ing, and the likelihood of divorce. In addition, by using
court files and register information, the study was con-
ducted without burdening victims, and with no selective
loss to follow-up as compared to a survey.

Conclusion
We studied a large sample of males and females who had
been sexually abused as a child, prospectively followed up
well into adulthood. For all victims, the abuse consisted
of contact sexual abuse and for over half of it entailed
penetration. Almost half of the victims were abused mul-
tiple times, and over a quarter experienced violence dur-
ing the abuse. Using register data we had objective data
on a number of family outcomes in adulthood.
Overall, this study found that being abused by a nuclear
family member, as compared to other types of perpetra-
tors, predicted teenage parenthood, early marriage and
divorce. We found being abused at younger ages to be
related to lower marriage rates. In addition, for female
victims, violence during the abuse was related to higher
risk of divorce. No effects of the invasiveness of the abuse
were found.
These findings suggest it is more the ‘relational set-
ting’ of the sexual victimization rather than the nature of
the abuse itself, that has the most impact on the victim. 
More in-depth research is however needed. Unravelling
the mechanisms through which CSA victims are affected
in their later lives requires larger samples (particularly
to be able to estimate effects for male victims), tailored
comparison groups, and information on more domains of
victims’ early and adult lives. All in all, our analyses pre-
sent a first step in understanding effects of CSA on life
domains such as family formation, and show how espe-
cially victims abused by people they may expect to shield
them from harm, are affected the most in their later lives.
