Abstract 
Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) has only recently been publicly acknowledged as a problem in India. A welcome develop-
ment has been the enactment of a special law—Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (POCSO) 2012—
criminalising a range of acts including child rape, harassment, and exploitation for pornography. The law mandates
setting up of Special Courts to facilitate speedy trials in CSA cases. The paper highlights the intended benefits and the
unintended consequences that might arise from the application of the law in the Indian context. Undoubtedly, the
passing of POCSO has been a major step forward in securing children’s rights and furthering the cause of protecting
children against sexual abuse in conjunction with a related legislation to clamp down on child marriages called the
Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006. The letter and spirit of the law, which defines a child as anyone under 18 years
of age, is to protect children from sexual abuse. However, criminalising all sexual behaviour under 18 years of age can
be problematic. This paper identifies three main issues arising from POCSO: age of consent, age determination, and
mandatory reporting; issues that highlight the fact that well-meaning laws can nevertheless have unintended nega-
tive consequences.

Introduction
Historically, child sexual abuse (CSA) has been a hidden
problem in India, largely ignored in public discourse and
by the criminal justice system. Until recently, CSA was
not acknowledged as a criminal offence; rape was the
main, if not the only, specific sexual offence against chil-
dren recognised by law in India. In the absence of spe-
cific legislation, a range of offensive behaviours such as
child sexual assault (not amounting to rape), harassment, 
and exploitation for pornography were never legally
sanctioned. In the past few years activists, Non-Gov-
ernmental Organisations (NGOs) and the central gov-
ernment’s Ministry of Women and Child Development
have actively engaged in helping break ‘the conspiracy
of silence’ (HRW 2013) and have generated substantial
political and popular momentum to address the issue. 
The movement, spearheaded by the Ministry of Women

and Child Development, led to the enactment of new
legislation called the Protection of Children from Sexual
Offences (POCSO) 2012. This commentary highlights
the distinguishing features of POCSO and focuses on
three issues that might have consequences for how the
law operates in reality. In this reflexive piece, we begin
by briefly discussing the prevalence of CSA in India and
the legal response to it. We draw upon existing literature, 
legal documents, media reports, access to police sources
and personal practitioner experience to inform the paper.
CSA in India
Growing concerns about female infanticide, child rapes
and institutional abuse of children led to the commission-
ing of the first large scale government sponsored research
study to assess the extent and nature of child abuse in India
(Kacker et al. 2007). The study, based on a well-designed
methodology, covered 13 states (two states from each of
the six geographic zones in the country) including states
with the highest through to the lowest crime ratesinci of
offences against children. The sample was purposive and
included 12,447 children, 2324 young adults and 2449

stakeholders representing five different evidence groups: 
children in the family, at the workplace, in schools, on the
streets and in institutions. The study reported widespread
emotional, physical, and sexual abuse prevalent in all the
states surveyed. While every second child reported emo-
tional abuse, 69 % (n = 12,447) reported physical abuse, 
and 53 % (n = 12,447) reportedly experienced some form
of sexual abuse. Half of sexual abuses reported were com-
mitted by “persons known to the child or in a position of
trust and responsibility” (Kacker et al. 2007: vii). Carson
et al. (2013) survey of the current state of knowledge on
CSA in India concluded that empirical studies report a
much higher incidence of CSA than previously acknowl-
edged by authorities or by families. The paper summarises
the findings of several studies and reports that 18–20 % of
CSA occurs in the family and around 50 % in institutional
settings. Further, there is regional and rural–urban vari-
ation in the rates and extent of CSA in the country. Girls
are more vulnerable to sexual abuse, although boys too
reported a high percentage of victimisation and are sub-
ject to greater social stigma. Finally, Carson et al. (2013) 
suggest that although sexual exploitation and abuse is
strongly correlated to poverty, it occurs in families across
the socioeconomic and religious spectrum. However, fac-
tors that facilitate CSA, such as poverty, overcrowding, 
extended family living arrangements, abundance of street
children, and lack of recreational facilities in families
(Carson et al. 2013) are by no means exclusive to India. 
Admittedly, their impact might be exaggerated or intensi-
fied given the population density and size in India. Thus, a
complex mix of individual, ecological and situational fac-
tors that are said to facilitate CSA (Smallbone et al. 2014) 
might account for its prevalence in the Indian context. 
However, the absence of empirical research precludes
definitive conclusions.
Sexually abused children are severely let down by sys-
temic failure of the criminal justice system to redress
their grievances and by social ostracism associated with
such abuse (HRW 2013).  Only 3 % of CSA offences
uncovered by Kacker et al. (2007) study were reported
to the police (HRW 2013). It is unsurprising that CSA is
severely underreported given the shame and associated
socio-cultural stigma, especially if the abuse is in the con-
text of the family (Choudhury 2006). This phenomenon is
not unique to India but common to collectivist cultures
in other Asian countries where an individual’s experience
is ignored so as to protect the family from shame asso-
ciated with sexual abuse (Back et al. 2003; Stoltenborgh
et al. 2011).
Legal response to CSA
Until 2012, the only sexual offences against children
recognised by the law were covered by three sections 
of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) not specific to children. 
The only crimes registered were rape (sexual intercourse
without consent—section 376), outraging modesty of a
woman (unspecified acts—section 354) and unnatural
acts defined as “carnal intercourse against the order of
nature with any man, woman or animal” (anal sex, homo-
sexuality or bestiality—section 377). Consequently, other
forms of non-penetrative sexual assaults, harassment and
exploitation were not explicitly recognised as crimes and
therefore not recorded (assuming they were reported).
Increased activism around child protection issues in the
media and public discourse might partly account for the
Government of India passing a special law called, ‘The
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) 
2012’. This Act criminalises sexual assault, sexual harass-
ment, and pornography involving a child (under 18 years
of age) and mandates the setting up of Special Courts to
expedite trials of these offences.
Table 1 indicates recorded child rape cases nationally
and for the state of Maharashtra as a case study.1 Maha-
rashtra is one of the most developed states in India and is
among the top three states with the highest recorded
child rapes from 2001 to 2013 (NCRB 2015).
Since 2001, there has been a gradual but steady rise
in recorded incidents of sexual abuse i.e. child rape. 
Although there is no evidence to indicate that globally
the prevalence of CSA has been going up over the years
(Barth et al. 2013), we might hypothesize that increased
reporting in India over this period might be the result
of greater public awareness, education and a more sen-
sitive criminal justice response to CSA. Following the
enactment of POCSO, the number of offences registered
under rape itself went up 44 % nationally and 68 % in the
state of Maharashtra within a year, lending support to the
hypothesis. Further, detailed figures from Maharashtra
provided by the second author indicate that total regis-
tered crime under POCSO was 2540 offences in 2013 and
3858 offences in 2014, amounting to a 51 % increase in
1 year.
Distinctive features of POCSO
POCSO 2012 does not use the term ‘rape’ more com-
monly used and also does not confine penetrative sex
to penile penetration. Instead, it broadens the offence
termed ‘penetrative sexual assault’ (section 3) to include
oral sex, as well as, insertion of any object into anus, 
mouth or vagina, in addition to penile penetrative sex. 
In State vs Pankaj Choudhary 2011, (pre-POCSO) the
accused could only be prosecuted for ‘outraging the mod-
esty of a woman’ for digital penetration of the anus and

vagina of a 5 year old child. The prosecution was unsuc-
cessful in proving rape as the High Court ruled that digi-
tal penetration was not recognised as an offence under
the India Penal Code (Delhi High Court 2011). The addi-
tion to the definition of penetrative assault has increased
the cover of protection for children.
POCSO also criminalises a range of behaviours as
being sexual assaults, short of penetration (section 7).
Additionally, the offences of ‘aggravated’ penetrative and
non-penetrative sexual assault is made more serious and
attract stronger penalties (sections 5, 9) when commit-
ted by a specified range of perpetrators, in a wide array
of situations or conditions, and/or has a severe impact
on the victim. This includes sexual assault committed by
persons in authority or position of power with respect
to a child, committed by persons in a shared household
with the child, in conditions such as: gang rape, causing
grievous bodily harm, threatening with firearm or corro-
sive substances, during communal or sectarian violence, 
assaulting a child under 12 years of age, or one who is
physically or mentally disabled, causing a child to become
pregnant, or knowingly assaulting a pregnant child, or
infecting the child with HIV, repeated assaults, or accom-
panied by public degradation. The definition is very com-
prehensive and covers a range of possible scenarios.
POCSO is also forward thinking in many aspects, in
that, the definition of sexual harassment includes repeat-
edly or constantly following, watching or contacting
a child either directly, electronically or through other
means [section 11(iv)]—thus, covering incidents of child
harassment via sexting or sexual cyberbullying. However, 
the interpretation of what might constitute ‘repeatedly’ 
or ‘constantly’ following or contacting a child with sex-
ual intent (with the law specifying sexual intent being a
‘question of fact’) is unspecified in POCSO 2012 and con-
sequently is potentially contestable.
The Act is quite distinctive in that it penalises abet-
ment of or attempt to commit any of the offences listed
in the preceding sections (section 16). Another ‘extraor-
dinary clause’ (section 29) in the Act is the presumption
of guilt of the accused, until proven innocent. This mat-
ter of jurisprudence lends itself to problems in the light 
of some of the points raised below (Andrade and Rao
2013).
The provision of Special Courts (section 35) where trial
proceedings may be conducted in a more sensitive man-
ner with the victim’s testimony given either ‘in camera’ (i.e. 
privately), via video-link, or behind curtains or screens, is
intended not only to reduce trauma but also protect the
identity of the child. The Special Court plays a pivotal role
in how the law and the evidence may be interpreted.
Implementation of POCSO 2012 involves various
criminal justice, state and third sector agencies and is
very resource intensive. Various problems arising from
resource scarcity and lack of appropriate training which
affect how investigations, prosecution and medical exam-
inations are conducted in cases of CSA in have been
identified by stakeholders in a state wide consultation
in Maharashtra (Maharashtra State Consultation 2014).
Instead of revisiting those problems which impact the
implementation of the Act, this paper focuses on three
issues—namely, age of consent, obligatory reporting and
age determination—embedded in the provisions of the
Act that might cause unintended negative consequences
individually and in combination.
Age of consent
All sexual acts described under POCSO are, without
exception, considered to be criminal offences if they
involve a ‘victim’ under the age of 18 years. This holds
true regardless of the issue of consent or the age of the
‘perpetrator’.  In cases of consensual sex between two
minors the concepts of victim and perpetrator become
interchangeable as the law inexorably criminalises
sexual behaviour for under-18 year olds. The Act does
not confer any sexual autonomy to children who may
then be liable for committing sexual acts under the law. 
POCSO invariably criminalises a juvenile ‘perpetrator’ of
CSA to be “dealt with under the provisions of the Juve-
nile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2000” 
[section 34(i)].
However, in 2013 a Special Court judge rejected the
notion that the human body of a person under 18 years is
the property of the State, whereby it can restrict individ-
ual autonomy on sexual behaviour. While ruling in a case
where a 15 year old willingly eloped with and married a
22 year old man, the judge held that criminalising such
behaviour would not serve the purpose of the enactment
(TOI 2013). There is thus a tension between the letter of
the law and its spirit. Determining whether an allegation
involving underage sex was forced or consensual would
depend greatly on individual interpretation of the cir-
cumstances. The law allows for abuse in either direction: 
being too restrictive of children’s autonomy or too per-
missive of CSA.

Finally, lack of proper support and professional help to
the victim and their family can sometimes cause greater
psychological harm and trauma (Oz and Balshan 2007).
Child Welfare Committees are to provide this support in
India but are not really functioning satisfactorily (Maha-
rashtra State Consultation 2014).  It therefore creates
difficulties for ‘victims’ as well as ‘perpetrators’ under
18 years, the latter are criminalised but not provided with
professional help they might need. 
the capacity to do so. Prescribing a legal obligation
with penal and financial sanctions, without think-
ing through the mechanism for its enforcement, 
and the resulting lack of accountability, might mean
that cases of failure to report fall through the cracks. 
There is a danger that the law may be used only ret-
rospectively to punish transgressions, rather than
ensure prospective reporting of suspected CSA by
competent authorities in appropriate cases.
Obligatory reporting
Mandatory reporting of CSA by any citizen, but espe-
cially those working with children and young people
in the education, social, religious and heath sectors is
enshrined in POCSO (section 19). Failure to do so car-
ries legal sanctions of imprisonment up to 6 months and/
or fines intended to encourage compliance with the law. 
Evidence in other countries (USA, Australia) shows that
mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse has had mixed
success (Kim et al. 2012; Ainsworth 2002). The Report
for the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to
Child Sexual Abuse (Mathews 2014) reported that since
the aim of mandatory provisions is to encourage report-
ing not police it, failures to report are rarely prosecuted
in some jurisdictions. As a result, in New South Wales
(Australia) the law has been amended to remove sanc-
tions for failure to report CSA (Mathews 2014). However, 
mandatory reporting obligation under POCSO raises
three problems specific to the Indian context:
1.Criminalising sex under 18 years virtually pushes
it beyond the purview of health professionals and
school counsellors who might be reluctant to impart
safe sex advice or treat effects of unsafe or reckless
sexual practices without breaching patient confiden-
tiality and/or getting involved with reporting it to the
authorities.
2.The law raises many issues for institutions, charities
and organisations working with poor and backward
communities and children and who are deeply com-
mitted to building relationships based on trust with
young people. Breach of trust would seriously jeop-
ardise their efforts to communicate with and work
with young people if they are legally bound to report
any knowledge of consensual, albeit underage sex. 
Lack of training for professionals (doctors, teachers, 
psychologists, social workers, counsellors etc.) work-
ing with children on how to deal with knowledge of
sexual activity and to respond appropriately can be
an additional problem (Goldman 2010).
3.Mandatory reporting raises the issue of who is or
should be responsible for enforcing this legal obliga-
tion. The police are overworked and scarcely possess 
A possible solution to the problem would be for a com-
petent authority to distinguish between acts of crime and
consensual sex at an early stage. Thus, the incident ought
to be reported, but decisions regarding registering an
offence and investigating may be discretionary.
Age determination
Determining the age of the victim and the perpetrator
is fraught with problems. The Special Court is author-
ised to determine age [section 34(2)] but there are no
clear guidelines as to how they are to do so. It is gener-
ally acknowledged that forensic means of establishing age
of a living person can be inexact and quite complicated
(Schmeling et al. 2003).  The Supreme Court of India
ruled in the case of Babloo Pasi vs State Of Jharkhand
and Anr that age determination is very difficult in the
absence of birth certificates or other official documen-
tation and while the opinion of a specially constituted
Medical Board may be useful in determining age, it can-
not be the only or conclusive factor to do so (Supreme
Court of India 2008). The Supreme Court further states
that a hyper-technical approach should not be adopted
and the Court should lean towards giving the benefit of
the doubt to the juvenile while ensuring that the law is
not being misused. Under POCSO the ages of both, vic-
tim and perpetrator, are pivotal in determining whether
and how the Act would apply and influencing the out-
come at the charging and trial stages. In developing
countries like India where a large proportion of births
are just not registered and therefore substantial sections
of the population do not have documents like birth cer-
tificates or school leaving certificates to provide proof of
age, this could be problematic.
Interaction between the three issues and its impact
on child marriages
Laws do not operate in isolation and often real life situ-
ations can confound even the noblest of intentions
enshrined in law. In this case, the legal age of consent
and mandatory reporting obligations of POCSO com-
bined with the difficulty in determining age could cause
more problems than anticipated for the criminal justice
system. POCSO in conjunction with Prohibition of Child

Marriage Act 2006 is intended to protect girls from being
forced into early marriages. While this is a worthwhile
goal to pursue, cultural and social norms supporting
early marriages in India combined with the individual’s
right to sexual autonomy might present impediments to
the fulfilment of that aim. A recent report on the census
data indicates that in India one in six women were mar-
ried before they were 18 years of age, of which 17.5 % (6.5
million) women had been married within 4 years prior
to when the census was conducted (Shaikh 2015). Thus, 
there are possibly 6.5 million (and growing) potential
law suits under POCSO. It could lead to enormous waste
of time and resources of the criminal justice system in
cases of consent to marriage by a girl between the ages of
15–18 years. Ignoring the role of consent in underage sex
combined with the inexact science of age determination
in a climate of mandatory reporting can potentially lead
to abuse of the legal system or miscarriages of justice.
A possible solution to this problem may be the manda-
tory linking of UID2 (Unique Identification) with victim
and offender data in cases involving underage parties at
the time of reporting to help determine the age of the
victim and perpetrator. However, this could potentially
raise a number of ethical issues and might be at cross
purposes with the original intention of the UID project
in India.
Summary
POCSO 2012 has undoubtedly made a significant con-
tribution to tackling the problem of CSA in India. It has
identified and criminalised a range of unacceptable sex-
ual behaviours that pose a threat to children. The number
of reported cases is increasing rapidly, indicating that the
law has made a substantial contribution in educating the
public, sensitizing the criminal justice system, and mak-
ing the reporting of CSA not just acceptable, but also
mandatory. The law has some unique features and is very
comprehensive. However three main issues identified in
the letter and spirit of the law could create potential prob-
lems for implementation in the Indian context. The issues
are: inflexibility regarding age of consent for sex under
18 years of age; mandatory reporting obligations; and the
inexact nature of age determination. Further, the Indian
government’s desire to prohibit child marriages and pro-
tect vulnerable children expressed in the Prohibition of
Child Marriages Act 2006, combined with POCSO 2012
should prove to be a deterrent to underage marriages. 
2  The UID (Unique Identification) project first conceived in 2006 to be the
basis of an efficient welfare system, involves issuance of a 12 digit individual
identification number by the Unique Identification Authority of India on
behalf of the Government of India. It enables identification for every resi-
dent Indian and establishes uniqueness of every individual on the basis of
demographic and biometric information ([URL: "https://uidai.gov.in"] https://uidai.gov.in). 
However, given the problems identified above and in a
climate where social and cultural norms still tolerate, if
not actively encourage child marriages, the potential for
waste and loss of resources cannot be denied.
