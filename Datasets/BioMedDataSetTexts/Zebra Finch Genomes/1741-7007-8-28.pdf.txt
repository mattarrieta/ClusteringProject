Abstract
Background: Among songbirds, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) is an excellent model system for
investigating the neural mechanisms underlying complex behaviours such as vocal communication, learning and
social interactions. Neuropeptides and peptide hormones are cell-to-cell signalling molecules known to mediate
similar behaviours in other animals. However, in the zebra finch, this information is limited. With the newly-released
zebra finch genome as a foundation, we combined bioinformatics, mass-spectrometry (MS)-enabled peptidomics
and molecular techniques to identify the complete suite of neuropeptide prohormones and final peptide products
and their distributions.
Results: Complementary bioinformatic resources were integrated to survey the zebra finch genome, identifying 70
putative prohormones. Ninety peptides derived from 24 predicted prohormones were characterized using several
MS platforms; tandem MS confirmed a majority of the sequences. Most of the peptides described here were not
known in the zebra finch or other avian species, although homologous prohormones exist in the chicken genome.
Among the zebra finch peptides discovered were several unique vasoactive intestinal and adenylate cyclase
activating polypeptide 1 peptides created by cleavage at sites previously unreported in mammalian prohormones.
MS-based profiling of brain areas required for singing detected 13 peptides within one brain nucleus, HVC; in situ
hybridization detected 13 of the 15 prohormone genes examined within at least one major song control nucleus.
Expression mapping also identified prohormone messenger RNAs in areas associated with spatial learning and
social behaviours. Based on the whole-genome analysis, 40 prohormone probes were found on a commonly used
zebra finch brain microarray. Analysis of these newly annotated transcripts revealed that six prohormone probes
showed altered expression after birds heard song playbacks in a paradigm of song recognition learning; we
partially verify this result experimentally.
Conclusions: The zebra finch peptidome and prohormone complement is now characterized. Based on previous
microarray results on zebra finch vocal learning and synaptic plasticity, a number of these prohormones show
significant changes during learning. Interestingly, most mammalian prohormones have counterparts in the zebra
finch, demonstrating that this songbird uses similar biochemical pathways for neurotransmission and hormonal
regulation. These findings enhance investigation into neuropeptide-mediated mechanisms of brain function,
learning and behaviour in this model.
Background
Songbirds, including zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata),
are well-established model organisms for a variety of
biological functions and are notable for their complex
natural behaviours such as vocal communication, learn-
ing and social living structures [1-3].  Of particular

interest in songbird neurobiology is the set of telence-
phalic nuclei, referred to collectively as the song control
system. This brain circuit is required for vocal learning
and song production in male zebra finches and in other
songbirds and is also connected to the auditory fore-
brain lobule that provides the system with auditory
information [4,5].

or peptide hormones [6,7]. A few neuropeptides have been
previously examined in songbirds [8-15]; those studies
demonstrated that neuropeptides could act within brain
regions relevant to song and other behaviours. Given the
potential for these signalling molecules to impact a wide
range of behaviorally-relevant neural functions, the present
study aimed to identify a large number of neuropeptides.
Neuropeptide research is complicated by several
different factors. Typically, the biosynthesis of neuro-
peptides starts with the production of a large protein
prohormone, which undergoes a variety of processing
events before the final products-bioactive peptides-are
generated. The gene that codes for a neuropeptide may
also contain sequences encoding several other peptides.
Peptides can be predicted from prohormone sequences
based on common proteolytic cleavage sites [16-19] and
directly measured in their bioactive forms from brain
samples [20]. The processing of a single prohormone
can vary depending on the tissues and/or the develop-
mental stages and, therefore, neuropeptide localization
is not always consistent with transcript localization.
Consequently, the comprehensive identification, mea-
surement and localization of neuropeptides in any spe-
cies require a multi-faceted approach.
Taking advantage of the newly-released zebra finch
genome sequence [21], we predict, measure and localize
the expression of a large complement of neuropeptides
in the zebra finch brain using a variety of techniques. A
survey of the zebra finch prohormone complement was
undertaken using bioinformatic tools. These results
were then used to annotate prohormone probes on a
widely used zebra finch microarray platform [22]. Neu-
ropeptidomic analyses using previously described mass
spectrometry (MS) approaches [20,23-26] were indepen-
dently conducted to identify the signalling peptides cre-
ated from these genes in the zebra finch brain and
pituitary. In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed for
a subset of prohormone genes. Both ISH and MS profil-
ing were employed to localize the potential for neuro-
peptide function in individual song control nuclei. The
integration of these different methodologies results in a
more comprehensive suite of neuropeptide data that will
accelerate investigation into their function in songbirds.
Results and discussion
Genomic annotation of neuropeptide prohormone genes
There were 70 matches to known chicken and mammalian
neuropeptide prohormone genes in the zebra finch gen-
ome resources, resulting in the identification of 51 prohor-
mones with complete sequences. Table 1 provides the
predicted zebra finch prohormones and homologous
chicken prohormones. Limited homology and genome
coverage or assembly errors prevented recovery of the full 
sequences for some matches. The GenBank zebra finch
expressed sequence tag (EST) database was used to con-
firm the identification and recover sequences. For
instance, somastatin (SST) was identified using the EST
[GenBank:CK234915] because of insufficient genome cov-
erage and sequencing errors. In other cases, the lack of
genome and EST sequences prevented complete recovery
of the prohormone. As an example, only a 22 amino acid
prediction was obtained for appetite-regulating hormone
(ghrelin/obestatin prepropeptide, GHRL) compared to the
116 amino acid chicken GHRL protein sequence.
Slight differences in assembly releases resulted in the
incomplete presence of nociceptin (PNOC) and pancrea-
tic polypeptide (PPY) prohormones. An EST [Genbank:
CK234392] was matched to the chicken PNOC and
translation of the EST recovered the first 77 amino
acids. This EST was not present in the genomic data as
only 35 bases were matched in the trace archives.
A match for PPY was identified in the pre-release
assembly but not in the release assembly. However,
there was no supporting EST data. The complete
chicken PPY prohormone was reported in UniProt but
was not present in the available chicken genome. Pep-
tide sequences have also been reported in UniProt for
the gull, turkey and ostrich, implying that the zebra
finch version may be present.
Using the EST database and chicken data, possible
alternative splicing was detected for six genes.
Three prohormones - pituitary adenylate cyclase-acti-vating polypeptide (ADCYAP1), glucagon (GLUC) and
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) - have been reported
with alternative isoforms in chicken. Tachykinin 1
(TAC1) has multiple mammalian isoforms and two
zebra finch isoforms were identified and subsequently
confirmed by ESTs. However, although no chicken
TAC1 isoforms have been reported, four TAC1 chicken
isoforms are predicted in the corresponding National
Center for Biotechnology Information gene entry. Two
prohormones, augurin or chromosome 2 open reading
frame 40 (C2orf40) and urotensin 2 domain containing
(UTS2D), had a single isoform that was supported by
EST data. In both cases, an alternative sequence was
predicted using the chicken sequence with Wise2 [27].
The zebra finch prohormone complement is similar to
the chicken and to mammals, with evidence for 68 pro-
hormone homologues in either or both the avian and
mammalian genomes. This included six prohormones
that matched the chicken genome reported by Delfino et
al. [28]. Urocortin 1 (UCN), identified in the zebra finch
by EST [GenBank:DV950835], was not identified in the
chicken genome. However, UCN still may be present
because there were gaps in the chicken genome between
the flanking genes. A proenkephalin-B prohormone

The list of 76 prohormone and signalling genes predicted from the survey of the zebra finch genome; information on gene name and identification are provided.
In the mass spectrometry (MS) column, a check mark (√) indicates confirmation via MS, an asterisk (*) indicates their homologues are identified in other species
and a dash (-) indicates no confirmation. Peptides from 24 predicted genes were detected by MS. The protein sequences of the discovered prohormone and
signaling genes are provided in FASTA format [see Additional File 2].
(prodynorphin, PDYN) similar to mammals was found in
the zebra finch genome but no match was found in the
chicken genome or related resources [28].
There was no evidence for three chicken prohormones
in the zebra finch genome: apelin (APEL),  renal
natriuretic peptide (RNP) and gonadoliberin II
(GNRH2). APEL has been reported in mammals and
identified in chicken by Delfino et al. [28]. There were
no suitable matches to chicken RNP, a member of the
natriuretic family, in either the zebra finch or mammals,
indicating that this duplication may have occurred after
songbirds (order: Passeriformes) diverged from chickens
(order: Galliformes). There was no match to mammalian
GNRH2 and the chicken GNRH2 was only reported as
a protein sequence with no corresponding location on
the chicken genome.
Two prohormones, C-type natriuretic peptide 1
(CNP1) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (C-RF)
amide peptide (CRFamide), were only found in avian 
genomes. CNP1 appears to be an avian-specific duplica-
tion, occurring after the divergence from mammals. An
RF-amide similar to prolactin-releasing peptide pro-
hormone, CRFamide was also identified in chicken and
mammalian genomes; it had a high conservation of the
20 amino acid prolactin-releasing peptide found in the
mammalian prolactin-releasing hormone prohormone.
Twenty-three known prohormones were not found in
the chicken or zebra finch genomes; 18 of the 23 appear
to belong to gene families where at least one member is
present in both mammalian and avian genomes. These
may result from a duplication in mammals that
occurred after the avian and mammalian species
diverged. For at least the natriuretic family, there are
both avian-specific and mammalian-specific duplica-
tions. One of these, the gene-regulated endocrine-speci-
fic protein 18 (RES18), is known to be in Eutherian
mammals. The lack of matches to the remaining pro-
hormones may be explained by limited homology with

confounding factors caused by incomplete genome
sequencing coverage which thereby prevented a reliable
prediction. For example, no evidence for proprotein
convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 inhibitor (PCSK1N)
was identified in the avian genome although Kudo et al.
[29] reported low homology between mammalian
sequences and Xenopus and zebrafish (Danio rerio)
sequences.
Identification of other signaling genes
Other signalling prohormones, including prolactin (PRL)
prolactin B (PRLB) and insulin growth factor-2 (IGF2),
were also identified. In addition, secretogranin V or 7B2
protein (SCG5) was identified, which is essential for pro-
hormone convertase 2 (PCSK2) function [30-32]. Our
genomic survey also confirmed duplication of somato-
tropin or growth hormone (GH) on chromosomes 1 and
27, which was also supported by EST data [33].
MS-based detection and identification of neuropeptides
in brain and pituitary
MS can directly measure peptides without prior knowl-
edge of the sequences of the prohormone or the
expected peptides. We implemented two complementary
MS platforms because this combined approach has been
shown to provide a more complete list of peptides
[24,34,35]. A total of 90 peptides were characterized
from the zebra finch brain and pituitary and 95% of
these peptide sequences were confirmed by tandem MS
(MS/MS) (See Additional File 1 for the sequences and
masses of identified peptides). We assigned the MS/MS
spectral information from the peptides characterized via
MS to our database of prohormones. This allowed us to
annotate our MS-confirmed peptide sequence informa-
tion as peptide products of 24 unique prohormones and
other signaling proteins (See Table 1). Every individually
detected and sequenced peptide was counted in the pre-
sent study.
The peptides we detected represent peptides processed
from the prohormones; most were produced by cleavage
at basic sites. However, because some peptides require
processing at unconventional cleavage sites, they may
not be predicted from the primary structures of the pro-
hormones using bioinformatics tools such as NeuroPred
[17]. For example, five chromogranin A (CHGA) pep-
tides-WNKMDEL, WNKMDELA, WNKMDELAKQL,
WNKMDELAKQLT and WNKMDELAKQLTS-were all
sequenced by MS/MS independently and, thus, were
considered as five peptides in our total count. Similar
examples of truncated peptides were detected for neuro-
tensin (NTS), cholecystokinin (CCK), proenkephalin
A (PENK), secretogranin-1/chromogranin B (SCG1),
secretogranin II/chromogranin C (SCG2), SCG5, thymo-
sin-beta and cerebellin (CBLN1),  either from the 
C-terminus or from the N-terminus. Each of these was
counted as a distinct peptide because similar truncated
peptides in other species have been reported to have
biological activity. For example, several different CBLN1
peptides have been described in other animals. Two of
these, the cerebellin hexadecamer and a truncated des-
Ser1 pentadecamer peptide, are both endogenous pep-
tides with biological relevance in rodent studies [36]. In
addition, two more cerebellin-related peptides have been
recently described that lack one residue at the C-termi-
nus of cerebellin and des-Ser1-cerebellin, respectively
[37].
Although several of the detected peptides may repre-
sent extracellular degradation that can occur during acid
extraction or postmortem decay, rather than naturally
processed bioactive peptides, our rapid dissection tech-
nique and use of chilled acetone minimizes the potential
for post-dissection proteolysis. Furthermore, the trun-
cated peptides usually eluted from the liquid chromato-
graphy column at different retention times, indicating
they were formed prior to the MS procedure. Given our
prior experience with peptide isolation, we surmise that
most of the peptides detected were derived from endo-
genous proteolytic processing.
Sequenced peptides directly detected in the brain
assisted in the identification and confirmation of the
correct sequence in the zebra finch genome. Many neu-
ropeptides are well conserved across species, especially
between avian species. For example, the NTS peptide in
chicken is QLHVNKARRPYIL; the predicted zebra finch
peptide sequence based on the genomic assembly is
QLHVNKSRRPYIL, which has an A to S substitution at
the seventh amino acid residue. However, our MS analy-
sis found that the peptide sequence in zebra finch was
the same as that in chicken. Comparison to published
zebra finch ESTs, and other genomic databases, indi-
cates that this is most likely an assembly error rather
than a single nucleotide polymorphism in the zebra
finch genome. The trace archive files also support the
MS sequence.
When searching the MS data against the zebra finch
resources and the prohormone databases of other spe-
cies, additional peptides were identified in the zebra
finch. These include: SKAGRVKLPP from mitochondrial
ribosomal protein S26 (MRP S26),  LPECCRQKTC-
SCRIYDLLHGMGNHAAGILTL-amide from orexin
(OREX),  SGSAKVAFSAIRSTNH and SGSAKVAF-
SAIRSTN from CBLN1 and PVDLAKWDGPSLS from
phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1 (PEBP1).
Peptides from non-prohormone proteins were also
detected with MS. Several thymosin-beta peptides,
including Ac-SDKPDMAEIEKFDKSKLKKTETQEKNP
LPSKETIEQEKQAGES, Ac-SDKPDMAEIEKFDK, Ac-
SDKPDMAEIEKFD and Ac-SDKPDMAEIEKF, were

identified in the zebra finch brain. Thymosin-beta
is commonly observed in the brain [34,35,38] and is
observed with neuropeptides during stimulated neuro-
peptide release [39,40].  Three peptides, TVGD-
VNTERPGMLDF, KQATVGDVNTERPGMLDF and
Ac-SEAAFQKAAEEVKQL from carboxypeptidase N,
polypeptide 2 (CPN2), were also identified in the zebra
finch. CPN2 is the regulatory subunit of a secreted tet-
rameric protein expressed in the nervous system of
other animals [41]; its identification here illustrates the
power of MS to detect other unusual protein processing
products in the brain.
Discovery of novel peptides
Using MS approaches, we directly detected several novel
VIP and ADCYAP1 peptides in addition to the previously
described peptides. Specifically, the MS data showed
strong evidence for the VIP peptide HSDAVFTDNYSRF
(Figure 1) and the ADCYAP1 peptides, VGGASGGL 
GDDAEPLT, HIDGIFTDSYSRY and QMAVKKYLAAV-
Lamide in the zebra finch brain. These novel peptides
overlap with the well-characterized longer VIP and
ADCYAP1 peptides, but are processed at basic sites that
appear not to have been reported previously for VIP and
ADCYAP1 in most other species. The zebra finch peptides
were shorter than the VIP, PACAP-27 and PACAP-38
peptides described in rat and mouse [42,43], suggesting
that VIP and PACAP prohormones may be subject to
different processing pathways in the zebra finch. The VIP,
PACAP-27, PACAP-38 peptides are neurotransmitters of
the inhibitory nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nervous sys-
tem involved in a number of physiological conditions,
mediated through common VIP/ADCYAP1 (VPAC1 
and
VPAC2
) receptors and specific ADCYAP1 (PAC1
) recep-
tors [42,43].  The newly-discovered short VIP and
ADCYAP1 peptides may also interact with these receptors
or have their own mechanisms of action to be revealed in
future experiments.
Figure 1 The vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) prohormone has been characterized in the finch.  (A) Aligned zebrafinch and chicken VIP
prohormones show peptides (underlined) and prohormone cleaveages ("|” symbol) and highlight the few differences between these two
species. (B) The VIP peptide HSDAVFTDNYSRF has been confirmed via tandem mass spectrometry. The peptide HSDAVFTDNYSRF was
fragmented in the mass spectrometer. Two different fragment ion series (b- and y-ions) were obtained, depending on whether the charge was
carried on the N-terminal or C-terminal side of the cleavage site. The amino acid residue(s) were assigned based on the mass difference
between two peaks, as annotated by the blue and red letters. Based on this information, the sequence of this VIP-related peptide is
unambiguously determined.

Characterization of posttranslationally-modified peptides
Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) can alter the
biological activity of peptides. They can be detected
using MS because each PTM has a characteristic mass
shift. These PTMs can provide more resistance to enzy-
matic degradation and regulate the binding affinity to
receptors and, thus, directly impact the bioactivity of
peptides. Some common PTMs, including C-terminal
amidation, disulfide bonds, N-terminal pyroglutamate
formation, and N-terminal acetylation, were identified in
the zebra finch peptides (see Additional File 1). For
example, the C-terminal amidation of the LPXRF-amide
(X = L or Q) motif of NPVF peptides and the disulfide
bond of the CYIQNCPXG-amide (X = any amino acid)
motif of Arg-vasopressin (AVP) were detected in this
study. These evolutionarily conserved PTMs may be
essential for the interaction of peptides with their cog-
nate receptors across Metazoan.
Distribution of prohormone gene expression in adult
brains
In addition to understanding the peptide complements,
the locations of expression also impact biological func-
tion. To identify brain regions that express prohor-
mone-related genes, ISH was conducted for 15 genes in
adult zebra finch brains-12 prohormone genes and
CBLN1, phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein 1 
(PEBP1) and, lastly, CPN2, which was used as a control
because it was detected in the MS experiments (Table 2
and Table 3). The ESTs used as ISH riboprobe tem-
plates covered at least 50% of the mRNAs as predicted
by the Ensembl gene models (release 55; [URL: "http://www.ensembl.org/Taeniopygia_guttata"] http://www.
 ensembl.org/Taeniopygia_guttata). Each EST showed a
homology of at least 79% to the corresponding chicken
mRNA sequence. Sense negative control hybridizations
showed no specific label, demonstrating the high strin-
gency of the hybridization conditions and suggesting
high specificity of the riboprobes to the zebra finch
transcripts. With the exception of the sexually
dimorphic song nuclei, no sex differences in distribution
were detected.
Expression of the 15 genes was examined in the four
major telencephalic song nuclei: Area X, the lateral
magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium
(LMAN), HVC (used as a proper name) and the robust
nucleus of the arcopallium (RA). Three genes, CPN2,
MST and SCG1, were expressed in all four nuclei
(Table 3, Figure 2), but POMC and NPVF mRNAs were
not detectable in the song nuclei. The remaining 10
genes were expressed in a subset of the song control
nuclei (Table 3, Figure 2).
Neuropeptides also modulate physiological processes
and behaviours other than song. ISH demonstrated that
prohormone genes were expressed in brain areas

Forty-one unique ESTs that represent 32 prohormone genes were identified on the zebra finch brain 20K SoNG microarray. Some ESTs were spotted twice on the
array, and in some cases more than one EST are from a single prohormone; all ESTs are included. Listed are the raw P-values from an experiment that compared
expression profiles in the adult male auditory forebrain after birds were exposed to three auditory stimuli: (AA, indicating the bird was habituated to song A on
one day then tested for its response to the song on the next day), novel song (SA, indicating the bird heard silence on the first day and then song A for the first
time on the day of testing) or silence (SS, indicating the bird heard silence both days) [44]; a false discovery rate (FDR) significant cutoff of FDR < 0.05 was used
to select genes for ISH analysis. Comparisons are: birds that heard either familiar song versus those that heard silence (AASS), birds that heard novel song versus
those that heard silence (SASS), or birds that heard familiar song versus those that heard novel song (AASA). Six ESTs that were reported to show a significant
change in the familiar group [44] were used as riboprobes for ISH analysis. Of these six, three ESTs showed a significant change in the number of cells with
modulated expression levels related to song experience. Significant P-values (P < 0.01 for microarray; P < 0.05 for ISH values) are in bold. A dash (-) indicates that
the EST was not investigated using ISH.

involved in controlling a variety of processes (Table 1).
For example, we found hybridization for 13 of the 15
genes within the paraventricular nucleus, ventromedial
nucleus and the preoptic area of the hypothalamus,
brain areas that are involved in regulating reproduction.
Several of these genes were also expressed within the
pituitary or the hypothalamic gateway to the pituitary,
the median eminence. These structures are essential for
reproductive control and other basic physiology such as
stress responses and regulation of thyroid function. The
septal nuclei and nucleus taeniae, implicated in affiliative
and aggressive behaviours, showed some low levels of
prohormone labelling. In addition, the principal cells of
the hippocampus, a structure required for spatial learn-
ing, showed hybridization with several prohormone
riboprobes and CPN2. Images of sections throughout
the entire adult male brain processed with ISH can be
found at [URL: "http://neuroproteomics.scs.illinois.edu/songbird/neuroanatomy.html"] http://neuroproteomics.scs.illinois.edu/song-
 bird/neuroanatomy.html.
Analysis of song-regulated prohormone genes
From the genome-wide survey of zebra finch prohor-
mones, the most commonly used zebra finch microarray
platform (20K SoNG microarray) was annotated for its
prohormone content [22]. There were 40 probes corre-
sponding to 31 prohormone genes, including three
probes corresponding to the duplicated GH genes and
SST2 identified on the array (Table 3). We then reexa-
mined data from an experiment where this microarray
was used to characterize changes in gene expression in
the adult zebra finch auditory forebrain during the phe-
nomenon of song response habituation [44]. In this data
set, we identified six prohormones that showed a signifi-
cant decrease in expression levels after song habituation
(false-discovery rate adjusted p-value < 0.05) [45].
We therefore performed ISH using ESTs for these six
genes on brains from birds that experienced either
silence (no playback of any song), playback of a novel
song or playback of a familiar (habituated) song (Table
3). Two of these genes, CCK and GH (chromosome 27
gene), showed significant changes (P-value = 0.051 and
P-value = 0.036, respectively) in the number of cells
above the intensity threshold in the auditory forebrain
of birds that heard familiar song compared to those that
heard novel song or no song. GH showed the decrease
in expression expected from the microarray results.
However, CCK actually showed an increase. NTS
showed a strong trend towards a lower number of
labelled cells in the auditory forebrain lobule after hear-
ing familiar song (P-value = 0.057). Insulin-like growth
factor 1 (IGF1), adrenomedullin (ADM), and neuropep-
tide Y (NPY) did not show a significant difference in the
number of labelled cells in the auditory forebrain lobule
across song exposure conditions 
Peptide profiling in the song nuclei
In order to directly measure a subset of the peptides that
exist within the major telencephalic song nuclei, we con-
ducted MS analysis on brain punches of Area X, LMAN,
HVC and RA. The quantity of peptides in these areas
was not adequate for MS/MS analysis to determine the
amino acid sequences. Thus, we used matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
MS to generate the peptide profile of each nuclei homo-
genate. We then assigned the peaks in the spectra based
on mass matches to the peptide list generated in the pep-
tidomic study of the whole brain. Figure 3 shows the
spectra from four different song nuclei, demonstrating
that each nucleus is characterized by slightly different
peptide profiles. Thirteen peptides were putatively identi-
fied in HVC by mass match, and a subset of those was
also detected in other song nuclei (Table 4).
Both MS analysis and ISH of individual song nuclei
demonstrated that the peptides may have complex dis-
tributions across the song system, sometimes present in
all nuclei but usually in a subset. Not all peptides were
measured by both techniques; but for those that were,
several complexities inherent to neuropeptide character-
izations were observed. First, we again saw multiple pep-
tides from the same prohormone but not all of the
peptides were detected in the same brain areas. For
example, some SCG1 peptides were detected within
HVC only, while others were measured within both
HVC and RA. This may indicate specific processing of
individual peptides that get targeted to each brain area.
Second, the distribution of the mRNA did not always
predict where the peptides were detected, demonstrating
that cell bodies that express prohormone genes may be
in different neuroanatomical locations than the cellular
projections in which the peptides reside [12,46,47].
Again, for SCG1, ISH showed expression in all four
song nuclei but a more restricted peptide distribution
was demonstrated using MS. This may reflect a
mechanism of controlled peptide transport and release
or a mechanism by which prohormone gene transcrip-
tion is regulated independently from the translation and
cleavage of active peptides. It is theoretically possible
that peptides and mRNAs were not co-localized due to
sensitivity limitations of one of the techniques, but the
proposed biological interpretations are consistent with
known peptide functions/processes. In addition, the
neuroanatomical distribution of prohormone gene
expression is consistent with previous gene expression
findings in HVC [48,49] and largely with previous
immunohistochemical analysis of peptide distribution in
song nuclei [12,46]. The distribution of peptides and
genes did not neatly separate according to brain region
(for example, striatal (Area X) and pallial (HVC, RA,
LMAN)) or function (for example, LMAN and X are

from HVC and RA).  The song system is, however,
clearly a circuit in which specific neuropeptide signaling
could modulate behaviour.
General summary
Neuropeptides are important signalling molecules that
modulate a variety of physiological and behavioural 
processes. In songbirds such as the zebra finch, neuro-
peptides have the potential to influence a complex beha-
viour of particular interest-song. As few neuropeptides
had been previously investigated in songbirds, we endea-
vored to identify as many potential neuropeptides as
possible, using the newly released zebra finch genome to
annotate our efforts. Because multiple neuropeptides
can be produced from a single prohormone and can be

The mass listed is the observed mass [M+H]+ from the MALDI TOF mass spectrometry of the HVC samples. The peptide identities of 13 peaks in the mass
spectrum of the HVC homogenate were assigned based on mass matches to the previously identified peptides. Three peaks (877.4, 1375.9, and 1415.8 m/z) were
assigned to two putative peptides each. A check mark (√) indicates the song nucleus where the masses were observed. A dash (-) indicates it was not detected.
transported distally to the location of the cell body, we
employed several complementary techniques. Specifi-
cally, we combined a bioinformatics approach to whole-
genome prohormone gene prediction, direct measure-
ment of neuropeptides within the whole brain
and within specific brain areas specialized for song, and
neuroanatomical gene expression mapping for a subset
of prohormone genes. Employing this multi-faceted
approach, we identified 90 peptides, including several
novel neuropeptides, directly from the whole brain and
described the potential for different peptide profiles to
exist in various brain regions such as the song control
nuclei.
Furthermore, we identified 70 putative prohormones in
the zebra finch. Most prohormone genes have brain EST
support. We also identified several new prohormones
that were not assigned by official gene models through
the Ensembl pipeline or described in other species [21].
Several prohormone genes showed the potential for alter-
native splicing, indicating that neuropeptide signaling
may be quite complex. Although some genes, typically a
subset of genes that belong to a multi-gene family, are
absent in the zebra finch, the complement of zebra finch
prohormone genes is similar to that in the chicken and
mammals [50]. Given that only a small number of neuro-
peptides have been investigated in songbirds to date
[8-15,51], this genomic analysis greatly expands the
opportunity to investigate how the regulation of prohor-
mone genes contributes to neural function. 
Several peptides can be produced from one prohor-
mone gene and, using our whole-genome prohormone
gene predictions, we often annotated multiple peptides
as belonging to the same gene. We considered each of
these peptides to be distinct, even if they were a series
of truncated forms from one peptide, because even
these seemingly small changes may have biologically
relevant consequences. We also detected several novel
peptides from the zebra finch brain that showed
sequence homology to VIP and ADCYAP1 prohor-
mones, which may have novel mechanisms of action.
Due to the impact neuropeptides have on animal phy-
siology and many complex natural behaviours [8-15,51],
we were particularly interested in characterizing the
peptide profiles in the four major song control nuclei in
the zebra finch: Area X, LMAN, HVC and RA. We also
identified prohormone expression in several brain areas
important for regulation of essential physiological pro-
cesses - learning and memory, reproduction and other
social behaviours. It is possible that neuropeptides pro-
cessed from these genes act at cell terminals located in
a brain area other than where the cell bodies measured
with ISH reside. For example, NPY fibers were described
in the songbird hippocampus [10,52], but we did not
detect labelling there with ISH. Several of our findings
are, however, consistent with previous reports. For
example, VIP and mesotocin levels in septal nuclei,
where these mRNA were localized, are regulated by
social behaviours in songbirds and are generally

correlated with levels of sociality in the zebra finch and
related species [53-56]. Many of the prohormones inves-
tigated here have not been functionally tested in the
songbird; thus, neuroanatomical localization of prohor-
mone expression is a useful guide for further examina-
tion of the function of neuropeptides in songbird
biology.
In order to further delve into the potential for neuro-
peptides to play a functional role in zebra finch beha-
viour, we used our genome-wide prohormone gene
annotation to identify prohormone ESTs (Table 3) on
the zebra finch brain SoNG microarray [22]. Previously
published experiments that compared gene expression
patterns across brain regions, sex and age, or experience
reported differences in some of these ESTs, including a
change in proenkephalin in HVC after birds sang
[22,44,48,57,58]. Here, we focused on genes that showed
changes during song response habituation in the audi-
tory forebrain lobule, an area crucial for processing and
learning complex, salient sounds [44,59-62].  In our
annotations, at least six prohormone genes showed a
significant decrease in expression levels 24 h after a
zebra finch was entrained by song repetition and our
ISH experiments confirm half of these changes [44].
These results provide an example of how prohormone
gene expression can be affected by behavioural para-
digms relevant to song learning [44,61,62]. 
prepared by a Milli-Q filtration system (Millipore, MA,
USA). Hydrochloric acid (HCl) and high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade solvents were
purchased from Fisher (NJ, USA). Trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA) was purchased from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.
(IL, USA). Heptafluorobutyric acid (HFBA) was pur-
chased from Thermo (IL, USA). Formic acid (FA) was
purchased from Fluka (WI, USA). The mixture of stan-
dard peptides used for the external calibration of
MALDI-TOF MS was purchased from Bruker Dal-
tonics (MA, USA).
Neuropeptide prohormone identification and
characterization
The bioinformatics identification of zebra finch prohor-
mone genes was conducted with two sets of candidate
prohormone gene lists using the approach described by
Southey et al. [19,50]. The initial list of candidate pro-
hormone genes was derived from known mammalian
genes supplemented by known or homologous avian
genes identified by Delfino et al. [28]. The second candi-
date list of homologous chicken or mammalian genes
that matched peptide sequences were obtained by
de novo sequencing. Candidate genes were searched for
in the zebra finch genome resources including genome
(assembly build version 1.1),  whole genome trace
archives and EST databases.
Conclusions
The most obvious outcome from this study is that the
zebra finch peptidome and prohormone complement is
now well characterized; this will become an important
resource for a number of follow-up studies. The combi-
nation of bioinformatic prediction of prohormone genes,
direct measurement of peptides and neuroanatomical
localization of prohormone gene expression provides
comprehensive and compelling insights into the influ-
ence of neuropeptides on songbird brain function and
behaviour.
Methods
Animals
We used developing (posthatch day 1-45) and adult
male and female zebra finches bred and raised in an avi-
ary at the Beckman Institute animal facility, University
of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. All procedures involving
animals were preformed in accordance with protocols
approved by the University of Illinois, Urbana-Cham-
paign Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Chemicals
Acetic acid, magnesium chloride (MgCl2
),  and 2,5-
dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (MO, USA). Water was 
Extraction of peptides
Optimized sampling procedures were used for peptide
extraction [20,34]. Zebra finch brains were dissected
from the skull and immediately homogenized in cold
acidified acetone (40:6:1 acetone:H2
O:HCl, v/v/v) on a
bed of ice. Following centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for
30 min at 4°C, the supernatant was removed, dried in a
SpeedVac (Savant Instruments, NY, USA) and reconsti-
tuted in a solution containing 95% H2
O/5% CH3
CN/
0.1% TFA. The sample was then filtered by a Microcon
YM-10 unit (10 kDa molecular weight cut-off, Millipore,
MA, USA).
Liquid chromatography fractionation
Samples were first purified using a microbore reversed-
phase HPLC system (Magic 2002; Michrom Biore-
sources, CA, USA) with a Dionex (CA, USA) C18 Pep-
Map column (150 × 1 mm i.d., 3 μm particle size, 100
Å pores) at a flow rate of 20 μL/min. Solvents A and B
consisted of 95% H2
O/5% CH3
CN/0.1% FA/0.01%
HFBA (v/v/v/v) and 95% CH3
CN/5% H2
O/0.1% FA/
0.01% HFBA (v/v/v/v), respectively. A three-step linear
gradient was used (5%-20% B in 10 min; 20%-50% B in
30 min; 50%-80% B in 20 min) for the HPLC separation.
Detection was performed via a dual ultravolet/visible
detector set at 220 and 280 nm. The fractions were

collected manually with a fraction collector (FC 203B,
Gilson, WI, USA). All the fractions were concentrated
using a SpeedVac before further analysis.
CapLC-ESI-IT MS analysis
A 5 μL aliquot of each HPLC fraction of interest was
further separated using a capillary HPLC system
(capLC, Waters Corporation, MA, USA) with a Dionex
C18 PepMap column (150 × 0.3 mm i.d., 3 μm particle
size, 100 Å pore size) at a flow rate of 2.5 μL/min. Dif-
ferent gradients were performed for each LC fraction
using solvents A and B (A: 95% H2
O/5% MeOH/0.1%
acetic acid/0.01% TFA (v/v/v/v);  B: 95% MeOH/5%
H2
O/0.1% acetic acid/0.01% TFA (v/v/v/v)). The eluent
was interfaced on-line with an electrospray ionization
(ESI) ion trap (IT) mass spectrometer (HCTultra PTM
Discovery System, Bruker Daltonics, MA, USA). A data-
dependent acquisition method was employed. The most
intense ions in the MS scan were selected as precursor
ions for MS/MS analysis. For each MS scan, two pre-
cursor ions were selected for fragmentation (MS/MS)
based on their intensity and charge (preferably +2). The
dynamic exclusion of previously fragmented precursor
ions was set to 2 spectra within 1 min. Collision-
induced dissociation (CID) was performed for MS/MS
analysis on each precursor ion. The collision energy for
CID was ramped for the most efficient and reproducible
MS/MS fragmentation. The MS and MS/MS scans were
performed in the range of 300-1500 and 50-2000 m/z,
respectively.
MALDI-TOF MS analysis
HPLC fractions were screened by a MALDI-TOF/TOF
mass spectrometer (Ultraflex II; Bruker Daltonics). A 0.5
μL aliquot of each fraction, along with an equal volume
of the matrix (50 mg/mL DHB in 50% CH3
CN/50%
H2
O/0.01% TFA (v/v/v)), was spotted onto an “MTP
384 massive target T” plate (Bruker Daltonics) and air-
dried. Positive-ion mass spectra were acquired using the
reflectron mode within a range of 580-6000 m/z. The
instrument was calibrated externally using a commer-
cially available standard peptide mixture.
Data analysis with bioinformatics tools
MS/MS data obtained from the ESI-IT MS were pro-
cessed and converted to a Mascot generic file format
(.mgf) using DataAnalysis software (Bruker Daltonics).
The .mgf files were automatically de novo sequenced
and then searched against the in-house zebra finch
prohormone database using Peaks Studio software
(Bioinformatics Solutions Inc, ON, Canada). Mass tol-
erance was set at ≤ 0.3 Da for MS and ≤ 0.5 Da for
MS/MS. Common modifications (for example, C-term-
inal amidation, N-terminal pyroglutamate formation 
and disulfide bond) were selected as variables. The in-
house database is composed of the zebra finch prohor-
mone genes, identified by bioinformatics characteriza-
tion. All obtained peptide identities were subjected to
manual verification for accurate ion series, reasonable
cleavage sites and PTM identification. A minimum of
three consecutive ion (b- and y-ion) matches is
required to be a true-positive match. Unassigned MS/
MS spectra were subjected to de novo sequencing and
subsequent BLAST search.
In situ hybridization for basal expression distribution in
adults
In situ hybridization was performed using adult males
and females. Brains were flash frozen and stored at -80°
C until processing. Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were
in vitro transcribed from clones in the ESTIMA Song-
bird EST collection that mapped to prohormone genes
in the zebra finch genome ([URL: "http://titan.biotec.uiuc.edu/cgi-bin/ESTWebsite/estima_annotations?seqSet=songbird3"] http://titan.biotec.uiuc.edu/
 cgi-bin/ESTWebsite/estima_annotations?seqSet=song-
 bird3; Table 3). ISH was performed as described pre-
viously [63].
In order to describe the basal distribution of pro-
hormone gene expression, we used unmanipulated
males and females removed directly from single-sex
holding aviaries (n = 3 per sex).  These brains were
sectioned in the coronal plane at 18 μm and sections
spanning the rostral-caudal extent of the brain were
processed with ISH. We used a total of 15 ESTs for
this mapping (Table 3).  Eleven of the prohormone
genes were selected because peptides had been identi-
fied and confirmed by MS/MS sequencing (see Addi-
tional File 1), three ESTs for peptides we were unable
to confirm with MS/MS (phosphatidylethanolamine
binding protein 1, orexin and cerebellin, and one was
to verify the presence of the non-prohormone-derived
peptide from CNP2 (see Results and Discussion sec-
tion for details).
In situ hybridization for song-regulated expression in
adult males
We investigated prohormone genes with a functional
connection to song biology and behaviour by first
using sequence homology searches of the predicted
prohormone gene set from the whole genome
(described above) to identify the prohormone ESTs
contained on the 20K Songbird Neurogenomics zebra
finch brain DNA microarray [22]. We then cross-refer-
enced these prohormone ESTs with the gene lists that
showed significant changes in transcript levels in the
adult male auditory forebrain after various song play-
back experiences [44]. Using a False Discovery Rate
[45] threshold of 0.05, we identified six prohormone
ESTs from this study that showed a significant change
Page 15

in hybridization intensities in birds with different song
experiences (ADM, CCK, IGF1, GH, NTS, NPY).
These ESTs were further investigated in the auditory
forebrain with ISH.
We used adult males that experienced one of three
acute song experiences. All birds were individually
placed into acoustic chambers and exposed to novel
conspecific song, familiar conspecific song, or silence
(n = three per group) prior to sacrifice in a paradigm
previously described [44]. Brains were sectioned to 12
μm in the saggital plane for focused investigation of the
auditory forebrain lobule. A total of three sections
representing the medial to lateral extent of the lobule
were processed and analysed for each bird.
In situ hybridization image capture and statistical analysis
Images were captured with either a Nikon LS-8000 slide
scanner or an AxioImager A1 (Carl Zeiss Microimaging,
NJ, USA) with a CCD camera (Microfire; Optronics,
CA, USA). In the case of the auditory forebrain images,
hybridization intensity and the number of hybridized
cells above intensity threshold were quantified using
ImageProPlus 4.5.1 (MediaCybernetics; MD, USA). We
measured hybridization in both the auditory forebrain
lobule and in the adjacent hippocampus, which does not
respond to song [62]. All auditory forebrain values were
normalized to the hippocampus values for statistical
analysis. Normalized values for each section were
summed across the three auditory forebrain lobule sec-
tions that represented one bird. These ‘whole auditory
forebrain lobule’ ISH measurements were used for one-
way ANOVA (SPSS; IL, USA) to test for differences
across the song exposure conditions.
MS analysis of peptide profiles in individual song control
nuclei
Adult male brains (n = 2) were rapidly dissected and
placed immediately into ice cold artificial cerebrospinal
fluid (aCSF) for 2-5 min. Brains were then mounted
and immersed in oxygenated aCSF for sectioning on a
Vibratome (Vibratome 3000 Series, Ted Pella, CA,
USA). Brains were cut into 500 μm slices. We visually
identified slices that contained major song nuclei (Area
X, LMAN, HVC and RA) and incubated them in a
slice chamber (AutoMate Science, Inc.,  CA, USA)
equipped with a temperature controller for 10 min at
41°C. The slices were continually perfused with EBSS
(without phenol red), supplemented with 24.6 mM glu-
cose, 26.2 mM NaHCO3 
and 2.5 mg/L gentamycin,
and saturated with 95% O2
/5% CO2 
at 45°C, pH 7.4.
Song nuclei were cut out of the ex vivo brain slices on
ice and immediately homogenized in acidified acetone
(40:6:1 acetone:H2
O:HCl, v/v/v) for MALDI-TOF MS
analysis.
