Abstract
Background: Genetic linkage maps are essential tools when searching for quantitative trait loci (QTL). To maximize
genome coverage and provide an evenly spaced marker distribution a combination of different types of genetic
marker are sometimes used. In this study we created linkage maps of four zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata)
chromosomes (1, 1A, 2 and 9) using two types of marker, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and microsatellites. 
To assess the effectiveness and accuracy of each kind of marker we compared maps built with each marker type
separately and with both types of marker combined. Linkage map marker order was validated by making comparisons
to the assembled zebra finch genome sequence.
Results: We showed that marker order was less reliable and linkage map lengths were inflated for microsatellite maps
relative to SNP maps, apparently due to differing error rates between the two types of marker. Guidelines on how to
minimise the effects of error are provided. In particular, we show that when combining both types of marker the
conventional process of building linkage maps, whereby the most informative markers are added to the map first, has
to be modified in order to improve map accuracy.
Conclusions: When using multiple types and large numbers of markers to create dense linkage maps, the least error
prone loci (SNPs) rather than the most informative should be used to create framework maps before the addition of
other potentially more error prone markers (microsatellites). This raises questions about the accuracy of marker order
and predicted recombination rates in previous microsatellite linkage maps which were created using the conventional
building process, however, provided suitable error detection strategies are followed microsatellite-based maps can
continue to be regarded as reasonably reliable.
Background
Linkage maps are fundamental tools in many genetic
studies and have been created using various types of poly-
morphic markers since their conception by Sturtevant in
1913 [1]. Genetic linkage maps determine the linear posi-
tion of genes or markers on a chromosome. They also
provide information on genome wide recombination
rates, as well as insight into intra and inter-species gene
rearrangements within and between chromosomes; thus
maps are useful in the study of evolutionary and compar-
ative genomics [2-4]. However one of their most impor-
tant applications is in the search for Mendelian and

Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) [5,6]. Over the last four
decades advances in molecular technology have meant a
wider range and greater number of genetic markers have
become available, enabling linkage maps to be created for
an increasing number of species, including many non-
model organisms [7-9]. It is therefore timely to consider
how different markers and different building approaches
may influence the accuracy of genetic maps.
Two key components to consider when constructing a
linkage map are the number and type of markers to use.
Phenotypic (i.e. visible) markers were the first to be uti-
lized, but now the choice has been extended to include a
range of molecular markers including allozymes, Random
Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPDs), Restriction Frag-
ment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs), Amplified Frag-
ment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs), Sequence-Tagged

Sites (STSs), microsatellites (Simple Sequence Repeats)
and SNPs. Each of these exhibit slightly different advan-
tages and disadvantages but there are three main consid-
erations when deciding which genetic markers to use in
linkage map construction: (i) the markers need to be
polymorphic, (ii) they need to be evenly spread across the
genome or region of interest and provide dense marker
coverage, and (iii) they must have a low genotyping error
rate.
Microsatellites are obvious candidates for linkage map-
ping; they are highly polymorphic, relatively easy and
cheap to score (once a library is established), and can
exhibit cross-species utility in closely related species [10-
13]. As a result they have been widely used in linkage
mapping studies of humans, model organisms, agricul-
turally-important organisms and wild vertebrate popula-
tions [14-20]. Recently though, technological advances in
locating and genotyping Single Nucleotide Polymor-
phisms (SNPs) has led to a decrease in both discovery
time and genotyping cost [21,22].  This has caused an
increase in their application in linkage mapping studies,
exemplified in an updated high density chicken linkage
map with 8599 SNPs [23] compared to the earlier map of
1889 molecular markers of which the majority were mic-
rosatellites [24].  This increased use of SNPs comes
despite their (usually) biallelic nature, which means they
provide relatively less information per locus. Lower vari-
ability means that they reveal fewer informative meioses,
making linkage between markers harder to detect. To
combat this, an increased number of markers, which are
evenly spaced and cover a high proportion of the genome,
can be used [25]. Additionally, it is possible to build maps
with a combination of low-density, high-variability mic-
rosatellites and high-density, low-variability SNPs. The
rationale of this approach is that the microsatellites might
act as anchors and cause otherwise unassigned SNPs to
be assimilated into linkage groups. This would produce
linkage maps of greater accuracy or density, which will
then be better suited to searching for QTL.
Microsatellites and SNPs also differ with respect to
consideration (iii);  the error rate. Markers with lower
error rates obviously produce more accurate linkage data.
A trade-off associated with the highly polymorphic
nature of microsatellites is that they can have relatively
high genotyping error rates [26,27]. Methods of genotyp-
ing and allele-calling microsatellites are only semi-auto-
mated, which can introduce human-based errors.
Modern SNP genotyping platforms are almost fully auto-
mated and error rates tend to be much lower [28]. In pre-
vious studies much emphasis has been placed on
identifying the consequences of genotyping error on the
accuracy of population genetic analyses [29,30].  It has
been acknowledged that these errors can impact on par-
entage inference or population structure analyses 
[26,27,31], but only recently has attention been focused
on the extent to which genotyping errors can impact
genetic linkage mapping [32,33]. In the human genetics
literature, the relative merits of SNPs and microsatellite
for genome-wide scans of complex diseases have been
compared [34-38], but these studies have focused on the
mapping of causative loci rather than the necessary initial
step of map construction.
In a recent simulation study, where markers were com-
pared for mapping accuracy, a difference in power
between bi-allelic markers and polymorphic markers was
reported, with a higher density of SNPs required to accu-
rately produce similar results to the polymorphic micro-
satellites [32].  However, it was shown that when
genotyping error rates are low, both SNP and microsatel-
lite maps can be produced accurately. When a simulated
5% genotyping error rate was introduced to microsatellite
genotyping, map inflation (sometimes by over 50%),
incorrect marker order and even occasional allocation of
markers to the incorrect linkage group occurred. This 5%
level of error is not unprecedented in microsatellite geno-
typing, even when using invasive techniques of DNA
acquisition [27,39]. Clearly there is a need to eliminate
markers with genotyping errors ~5% wherever possible
before proceeding with linkage analysis.
The aim of this study was to compare linkage maps
built with microsatellites, SNPs and a combination of
both markers to determine the ability of each method to
produce accurate linkage maps. A linkage map of the
zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) genome using SNP
markers has recently been released [40], and a genome
assembly is publicly available, which facilitates compari-
sons of marker order between linkage maps and physical
assemblies. By independently constructing microsatellite
linkage maps of the zebra finch macro-chromosomes 1,
1A, 2 and 9, using the same pedigree as was used in the
SNP map, we were able to explore how marker type influ-
enced map length and order. Guidelines for mapping
studies that employ microsatellites and SNPs simultane-
ously are provided, as we recognise that sometimes it is
practical to combine datasets containing both types of
marker.
Methods
The captive zebra finch population used in this study is
one which has been maintained within the Department of
Animal and Plant Sciences at the University of Sheffield
since 1985 under the stewardship of TRB. The 3-genera-
tion mapping pedigree comprises 354 individuals and is
the same pedigree as that used to build a SNP map of the
whole zebra finch genome [40].  Genomic DNA was
extracted from either blood or tissue samples using the
ammonium acetate precipitation method [41]. The main-
tenance of the zebra finch pedigree along with the extrac-

Office guidelines under project license number 40/2788.
SNP discovery and genotyping
The SNP genotyping data used in this study is the same as
that previously published in [40]. This previous study was
the first genome-wide zebra finch linkage map and incor-
porated 876 SNPs across 45 linkage groups. On the four
chromosomes which are compared in our study there are
250 SNPs (73 on Tgu1, 71 on Tgu1A, 82 on Tgu2 and 24
on Tgu9).  The SNPs were identified from cDNA
sequences generated by Washington University Genome
Researching Centre on a 454 Life Sciences ultra-high
throughput pyrosequencing platform. The genotyping
was undertaken by Illumina (San Diego) using the golden
gate platform where 1356 potential SNPs were analysed.
The genotyping data was estimated to be 100% reproduc-
ible, had a 95.5% call rate and a 0.17% parent-offspring
error rate. After false and monomorphic SNPs and SNPs
with a minor allele frequency <0.05 were discarded, 876
SNPs remained and were assembled into linkage groups.
For a more detailed account of the SNP genotyping see
[40].
Microsatellite discovery
In order to discover polymorphic microsatellites, three
methods were implemented. Initially, previously pub-
lished microsatellites from the avian literature and a set of
highly conserved microsatellite loci located in the zebra
finch expressed sequence tag (EST) public databases were
assessed [42,43]. By predicting chromosomal locations of
the loci in the chicken genome sequence assembly [44],
we discovered that the chromosomes 1, 2 and 9 had the
highest number of already available microsatellites and so
we subsequently focused on locating more microsatellites
within these three chromosomes. However, in the zebra
finch this equates to 4 chromosomes because Chicken
chromosome 1 shares homology with two chromosomes
in passerine birds [2,40,45,46]. Thus we were focusing on
4 chromosomes in the zebra finch (Tgu1, Tgu1A, Tgu2
and Tgu9).
We attempted to increase our marker density on these
4 chromosomes using the program SPUTNIK (Sputnik
 http://abajian.net/sputnik/) to search two zebra finch
sequence databases for microsatellites. The first approach
took advantage of the zebra finch EST sequences located
on the National Centre for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) website (described in [47]),  and the second
searched the zebra finch Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS)
GenBank tracefiles, as the assembled zebra finch genome
was unavailable at that point. These searches were
restricted to dinucleotide repeat motifs. In general, mic-
rosatellites with uninterrupted long repeats have been
shown to be the most variable [48,49]. Therefore, only 
repeats of greater than 40 bp and with at least 90% purity
were considered for further use. This ensured that micro-
satellites with the greatest potential for high variability
were selected. As there can be more than one trace file for
any region of the genome, files containing overlapping
sequence were combined into contigs using the CAP3
contig assembly program [50].
A zebra finch homologous location for each microsatel-
lite marker was found by directly comparing its sequence
against the zebra finch genome assembly. Chromosomal
locations were identified by Basic Local Alignment
Search Tool (BLAST) analysis to compare the avian mic-
rosatellite or the zebra finch sequence (Whole Genome
Shotgun (WGS) tracefiles or ESTs) against the zebra finch
genome sequence (version 1, Zebra Finch Genome Con-
sortium). BLAST analyses were carried out using Stand-
alone BLAST version 2.2.17 [51] using the default
parameters with minor modifications (W = 10, m = 8, e =
1e-5). The chromosome position with the lowest e-value
was considered a good hit if the e-value of the hit was less
than 1e-10 and the difference between it and the next best
hit was 10 decimal places. In general, the length of the
query sequence significantly affects whether a reliable
BLAST hit can be found [3]. However, the zebra finch
WGS sequence trace files and ESTs were usually about
600 bp long and thus produced reliable hits on the
genome with e-values of much less than 1e-5 (See addi-
tional file 1: Table S1, for characterization of the micro-
satellites).  These positions allowed us to focus our
attention on the loci located only on the chromosomes of
interest (Tgu1, Tgu1A, Tgu2 and Tgu9).
Microsatellite primer design and testing
There are three minor distinctions between the way loci
were identified and primers designed in this study. These
can be discerned by the names used for each primer pair,
with the prefixes ZF, TG and ZEST used to discriminate
between the different design methods (Table 1).
First, to increase the probability of microsatellite co-
amplification in other species, consensus sequences were
used to identify the most conserved regions for primer
design. For these markers, prefixed "TG", the primer sites
are in regions of 100% identity between the zebra finch
and chicken (their design is described elsewhere [43]).
Second, primers for markers with prefix "ZF" were cre-
ated using only the zebra finch sequence from the WGS
sequence trace files. Finally, markers labeled ZEST were
designed from sequences first reported in [47] and are
microsatellites isolated from the zebra finch EST Gen-
bank entries. Primers were designed using these zebra
finch EST sequences rather than genomic sequence.
Primers were designed using the web interface of the
program PRIMER3 ([52],  [URL: "http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/"] http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/
 primer3/). The PRIMER3 default parameters were used,

except that a CG clamp was required at the 3' end of each
primer and the maximum consecutive number of the
same bases (Max-polyX) was lowered to 3. The maxi-
mum primer melting temperature (Tm) was set at 60°C,
the minimum was set at 54°C and the maximum Tm dif-
ference between the forward and reverse primer was low-
ered to 0.5°C. By using the settings stated above we
attempted to ensure all primers would amplify with a
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) annealing temperature
of 56°C.
The forward primer was labeled with a fluoro-dye (6-
FAM, 5HEX or NED) to enable allele size assignment on
an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer. The initial tests for amplifi-
cation were each carried out in 10 μl PCR reactions.
These contained about 50 ng of genomic DNA, 1.0 μM of
each primer and 0.25 units Taq DNA polymerase (Ther-
moprimePlus, Advanced Biotechnologies) in the manu-
facturer's buffer (final concentrations 20 mM (NH4
)2
SO4
,
75 mM Tris-HCl pH 9.0, 0.01% (w/v) Tween), including
2.0 mM MgCl2 
and 0.2 mM of each dNTP. PCR amplifica-
tion was performed in a TETRAD DNA Engine (MJ
Research, Biorad) or a Touchdown thermal cycler
(Hybaid). The following PCR program was used for these
singleplex test reactions, 3 minutes at 94°C, followed by
35 cycles of 30 seconds at 94°C, 30 seconds at 56°C and 30
seconds at 72°C, then 10 minutes at 72°C. PCR products
were then separated and visualized using an ABI 3730
DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) using Prism set DS-
30 and the ROX size standard (ABI, Foster City, USA) and
allele sizes assigned using GENEMAPPER 3.7 (Applied
Biosystems).
Sixty-four microsatellite primers were initially tested
for PCR amplification success and polymorphism. Of
these, 26 were first tested on 12 zebra finch individuals (4
wild zebra finch and 8 mapping pedigree individuals).
Any markers which had more than 2 alleles were then
tested on 24 birds in the mapping population. However,
the 38 primers with prefix "ZF" were initially tested in all
24 individuals. After this, observed and expected
heterozygosity and predicted null allele frequencies were
estimated using CERVUS v3.0 [53]. A total of 26 markers
displayed more than 3 alleles and had an observed
heterozygosity greater than 0.3, and were then used for
further analysis. The zebra finch mapping pedigree con-
taining 354 individuals was genotyped at these 26 loci
(Table 1). Unfortunately, one of these markers (ZF01-170)
failed to amplify correctly within its multiplex set.
Microsatellite genotyping and error rate checking
The majority of the pedigree individuals were of known
phenotypic sex (171 females, 175 males and 8 individuals
of unknown sex).  All individuals were PCR sex-typed
using the Z-002 sex-typing primers [54] during the geno-
typing to check for any identity errors. There were two 
cases of mismatches between genotypic and phenotypic
sex; these samples, along with eleven others, contained
inheritance errors, exhibiting incompatible genotypes
with known relatives. They were excluded from further
analysis.
When genotyping the whole pedigree, a Qiagen multi-
plex mix was used during PCR amplification. Four multi-
plex sets were designed, each containing between 6-9
markers (Table 1). All markers in each set were co-ampli-
fied and loaded onto an ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer. The
PCR program was the same as used in the singleplex
reactions except the annealing temperature (Ta) was
increased to 57°C; see Qiagen multiplex guidelines for the
rest of the protocol.
Two markers (ZF01-196 and ZF01-025) were included
in multiple multiplex sets to verify repeatability between
the different PCR sets. Marker ZF01-196 was multiplexed
in sets 2, 3 and 4 and ZF01-025 in sets 2 and 3. For ZF01-
196 the number of samples that did not amplify was sig-
nificantly greater in set 2 (42) than in sets 3 (10) and 4
(18) (χ2 = 23.8, p < 0.005, d.f. = 2). This was also the case
for ZF01-025 with set 2 containing 61 ungenotyped sam-
ples compared to 24 in set 3 (χ2 = 16.1, p < 0.001, d.f. = 1).
The lower call rate in Set 2 is probably due to the
increased number of markers incorporated into this set,
as increased competition between primers could lead to
reduced amplification of some loci. In total, 12 of the 273
individuals, which could be genotyped at locus ZF01-196
in all 3 sets, exhibited 2 different genotypes. The geno-
type that was exhibited in 2 of the sets was assumed to be
the correct one, which gave a 1.46% error rate at this
locus. The repeatability of locus ZF01-025 was better
with only one genotyping inconsistency within the 289
samples that were genotyped in both sets giving an error
rate of 0.17%. The errors were distributed across all mul-
tiplex sets, making it difficult to identify the reasons for
these anomalies, but suggesting that they were not due to
consistent differences between the quality or reliability of
the multiplexes.
An alternative method of checking the error rate is to
measure the frequency of deviations from Mendelian
inheritance. After genotyping the full pedigree we used
the programs PedCheck and CERVUS v3.0 to assess the
quality of the data [55,56]. Where parent-offspring geno-
type mismatches were identified we reanalysed the 3730
output in GENEMAPPER. In most cases an allele had
been missed or incorrectly genotyped and was therefore
corrected. After this, CERVUS was used to estimate null
allele frequencies, and the remaining parent offspring
mismatches were used to estimate the error rate. For
some markers with high estimated null allele frequencies
it was possible to identify where null alleles were segre-
gating in the pedigree. In order to keep as many informa-
tive recombination events as possible in the analyses,

these null alleles were dummy-coded as allele '99' (for
markers ZF01-136, ZF02-068 & Smm4(ZF09-004)).
These data could then still be used to create the linkage
maps. Any markers which had a parent-offspring error
rate of >2% were excluded from further analysis (4 mark-
ers) as it has been shown by simulation that typing error
can cause map inflation and affect marker allocation to
linkage maps [32]. In total the number of microsatellite
markers initially used to create linkage maps of chromo-
somes Tgu1, Tgu1A, Tgu2 and Tgu9 were 5, 4, 6 and 6
respectively (Table 1).
Map construction
Linkage maps were constructed using a version of Cri-
Map 2.4 [57] modified by Xuelu Liu (Animal Genomics
and Breeding group, Monsanto Company) to accommo-
date large numbers of markers segregating in compli-
cated pedigree structures. Initially, the pedigree was split
into 14 sub-families using the CRIGEN function. Then
the TWOPOINT command was used to calculate the
two-point LOD scores between all possible marker pairs.
AUTOGROUP was implemented to assign the markers
to linkage groups. AUTOGROUP groups markers via an
iterative process based on marker variability and linkage
quality, starting at an upper, stringent layer and proceed-
ing through lower, less stringent layers. The parameter
layers were as follows: Layer 1 (40, 2.0, 2, 0.9); Layer 2 (20,
1.5, 3, 0.7); Layer 3 (10, 1.0, 5, 0.6); Layer 4 (5, 0.4, 6, 0.5).
The lower layer defines the minimum requirements for
inclusion in a linkage group. In this way, linkage groups
were created between markers that were linked with a
two-point LOD score > 5, had a minimum of 0.4 times
the average number of meioses, shared linkages with no
more than six other groups and had a minimum linkage
ratio (i.e. the proportion of two point linkages for a given
marker to other markers in the same linkage group) of
0.5. Once the markers were assigned to linkage groups
relative marker order was determined as described below.
During the initial stages of map building redundant
markers were removed using the HAPLOGROUP com-
mand. This identified tightly linked markers (recombina-
tion fraction = 0, LOD >10) and used only the most
informative marker in each haplogroup for map assembly.
Using the remaining informative markers, framework
maps were created using the BUILD command. The
BUILD command was implemented by entering two
linked, informative markers with recombination fractions
of between 0.1-0.2 as ordered loci, and inserting the
remaining loci. The likelihood threshold was set at 5, so
the marker order with a likelihood of LOD ≥ 5 better than
the next most likely order was chosen. The process was
repeated twice, each time starting with a different pair of
markers. Of the three maps, the one with the most mark-
ers was chosen as the first framework map. The FLIPS5 
function was used to shuffle marker orders and identify
the most likely marker order. Using this framework map,
we added the remaining markers by progressively drop-
ping the likelihood threshold to LOD = 3, 1, 0.1, 0.01 and
then 0.001. This results in a comprehensive map of all
markers, with the final order determined by the best like-
lihood given the data available. The positions of markers
mapped at the lower LOD thresholds are less well sup-
ported. In most studies a LOD of ≥3, i.e. marker order
1000 times more likely than any other marker order is
considered a conservative (or framework) map [58]. The
FLIPS5 command was again used to check that no alter-
native order had a higher likelihood. Next, the markers
previously excluded (via the HAPLOGROUP command)
were added to the assembled map using BUILD at a likeli-
hood threshold of LOD > 0.001 and marker order was
again rechecked using FLIPS5. Finally the command
CHROMPIC was used to identify any putative double
recombination events between closely linked markers
that may be indicative of incorrect marker order or geno-
type errors. CHROMPIC provides a schematic of the
paternally and maternally inherited chromosomes of each
individual, with the inferred grandparental origin of each
marker allele indicated. This schematic shows each
recombination event and flags any alleles which do not
share the same grandparental origin with alleles at adja-
cent markers on the same haplotype. If one marker is
flagged in a large number of individuals this suggests that
it is either placed in the wrong location on the linkage
map or has a high error rate.
Using CHROMPIC, one microsatellite marker (ZF01-
054) was excluded from Tgu1A as even when positioned
in its location with highest likelihood it was consistently
flagged, suggesting it had a high error rate. This was also
supported by the fact that its presence increased map
length by a substantial margin (20 cM) [32]. A subsequent
BLAST of the zebra finch trace file used for the primer
design against the released zebra finch genome sequence,
revealed that the first two bases at the 5' end of the for-
ward primer were not consistent with the genome assem-
bly sequence. This could potentially cause allelic drop-out
leading to the high degree of error that is likely present in
the genotypes at this locus. This exclusion reduced the
number of microsatellites on this linkage group to three.
All linkage map distances are expressed in Kosambi centi-
Morgans (cM) and the map figures were constructed in
MapChart [59].
Examining map accuracy
Linkage maps were constructed for the microsatellites
and the SNPs separately using the approach outlined
above. We also built combined linkage maps including
both the microsatellites and SNPs. We constructed these
combined maps via two different methods. The first

approach followed the conventional method as described
above and elsewhere [40].  Typically, this would mean
microsatellites would be among the first markers added
to the map, as they are highly informative. Hereafter the
map is termed the 'SNPs & microsatellites conventional'
map. The second approach involved adding the relevant
microsatellites directly to the comprehensive SNP linkage
maps (presented in [40]).  This was carried out using
BUILD, and as with previous approaches the likelihood
threshold was progressively reduced (LOD ≥ 5, 3, 1, 0,
0.05, 0.001) until all the microsatellites were added to the
linkage map. Here the microsatellites were added after
the SNPs (hereafter this is termed the 'SNPs preceding
microsatellites' map).
To validate the accuracy of the maps we compared
marker order on each linkage map with the order on the
zebra finch genome assembly [URL: "http://genome.wustl.edu/genomes/view/taeniopygia_guttata/"] http://genome.wustl.edu/
 genomes/view/taeniopygia_guttata/.  We also compared
SNP-only maps with maps that contained SNPs and mic-
rosatellites, in order to test whether the inclusion of mic-
rosatellites caused map length inflation.
Results & Discussion
Error rate
Microsatellite genotyping error has been highlighted as a
major cause for concern in population genetic analyses,
including parentage assignment (reviewed in [27]). Par-
ticular attention has been given to studies using non-
invasive techniques for DNA acquisition, but errors are
present in all studies and this is increasingly being recog-
nised in the literature [60]. Even in studies dealing with
high quality DNA samples, the potential for error
remains, particularly those caused by human error. When
one investigation critically assessed the degree of geno-
typing error in an Antarctic fur seal paternity exclusion
study, up to 93% of the errors were attributable to human
mistakes [26,27].
The greater number of alleles of microsatellite markers,
along with a less automated method of genotyping leads
to a higher error rate relative to SNPs [25]. Within the
SNP mapping project [40] one individual was repeatedly
genotyped 7 times at all 1048 SNPs to measure repeat-
ability, and no errors were detected (100% accuracy).
Also, across all SNPs the average parent-offspring mis-
match rate was 0.17%. In contrast, for the 25 microsatel-
lites initially genotyped in the zebra finch mapping
pedigree the mean error rate per locus was 1.32%, based
on the frequency of departures from Mendelian inheri-
tance implemented in CERVUS (Table 1). This value is ~7
times more than the SNP error rate. For construction of
the maps, only microsatellite markers with an error rate
<2% based on parent-offspring mismatches were used. As
a result, four markers (ZF01-139, ZF01-180, ZF01-081 &
ZF02-038) were excluded from further analyses. For the 
microsatellites used in the final linkage maps the average
error rate was 0.34% based on Mendelian inheritance
inconsistencies. This is fairly low, although it is still
almost double that found in the SNPs, even though the
most error prone microsatellites have been removed from
the dataset while all SNPs were retained.
Although genotyping errors are not uncommon, most
can be easily identified. In this study the pedigree was
known, and due to the number of markers typed in the
entire pedigree (25), it was possible to detect any allele
calls that caused departures from Mendelian inheritance.
Any individuals involved in a parent-offspring mismatch
were re-examined on the program GENEMAPPER.
Eleven individuals were inconsistent with Mendelian
inheritance at greater than 5 microsatellite loci and there-
fore were assumed to have been contaminated or incor-
rectly labelled. The results from these samples were
subsequently excluded from all analysis. The high vari-
ability of microsatellites aids error detection as most
errors will result in Mendelian incompatibilities. How-
ever, with SNPs this error-checking procedure will be less
successful as they are only biallelic. Some studies have
predicted that up to 30% of errors in SNP genotyping will
remain undetected because they will not cause Mende-
lian inheritance incompatibilities [61,62].
After re-examining the allele calling any remaining mis-
matches could be due to allelic dropout, scoring error,
more cryptic biochemical artefacts or de novo mutations
in the germline. Given that we have excluded loci with
high error rates, identified mis-labelled or mis-pedigreed
individuals and re-scored individuals that cause mis-
matches or unlikely double recombination events, it
seems reasonable to assume that the subsequent impact
of typing error on map construction that we report is
conservative. Of course, it should be regarded good prac-
tice to remove as much of the detectable error as possible.
It is important to note, and perhaps underappreciated,
that some genotype errors will not cause Mendelian
inconsistencies, but can still lead to the inference of spu-
rious recombination events. For example, suppose an off-
spring with a true genotype of A/A was miss-scored as A/
B. If it has parents with genotype A/A (mother) and A/B
(father) both the true and incorrect genotype are compat-
ible with Mendelian inheritance. However it would be
wrongly assumed that allele B was inherited from the
father, which would lead to the inference of at least one,
but more likely two, additional recombination events.
Therefore, even with careful error checking, loci with
high error rates are likely to cause map inflation.
Robustness and reliability of maps
(i) Assignment of markers to the correct chromosome
The linkage maps generated by the 4 different methods
are presented in additional file 2: Table S2, along with the

physical positions of each marker on the zebra finch
genome assembly. As anticipated, both SNP and micro-
satellite markers formed linkage groups corresponding to
their predicted chromosome based on the zebra finch
assembly. We have only presented the sex-averaged link-
age maps as there is little evidence of heterochiasmy in
the SNP linkage maps [40].
The greatest difference between the SNP and microsat-
ellite maps is the number of markers on each, with all
chromosomes containing substantially more SNPs. The
linkage groups Tgu1, Tgu1A, Tgu2 and Tgu9 contain 73,
71, 82 and 24 SNPs respectively compared to only 3, 5, 6
and 6 microsatellites. However, every microsatellite was
assigned to the correct linkage group, even on the low-
density microsatellite only maps. The ability to detect
linkage between the microsatellites when so few are used
is due to the relatively high number of informative meio-
ses of these markers (Figure 1). Across all 265 markers,
the number of phase known informative meioses was sig-
nificantly greater for the microsatellites (mean = 216.3)
than for the SNPs (mean = 62.3; t = -10.71, p < 0.0001
(two-tailed), d.f. = 19.44).
The number of markers used in linkage maps obviously
impacts on the coverage that the markers provide over
the chromosomes. In all cases the SNPs provide a higher
coverage of the 4 focal chromosomes. For linkage groups
Tgu1, Tgu1A, Tgu2 and Tgu9, about 76%, 96%, 73% and
90% respectively of the chromosomes are estimated to be
within 2.5 Mbp of a SNP marker. However, the coverage
for the same chromosomes is only 24%, 20%, 16% and
76% for the microsatellite markers.
(ii) Estimation of recombination rates and distribution of
recombination events
As previously highlighted [40,63] and observed to a
degree on the framework SNP maps in Figure 2, recombi-
nation rates in the zebra finch appear greatest near the
telomeres of the chromosomes, especially on the macro-
chromosomes. Most of the microsatellite markers were
not positioned near to the end of the chromosomes and
so are predicted to be in regions with lower recombina-
tion rates. Therefore, to compare recombination rates
between the SNP and microsatellite maps, it was neces-
sary to restrict comparisons to regions on the SNP map
that overlap the chromosomal regions covered by the
microsatellites.
The microsatellite maps consistently estimated higher
recombination rates than did the SNP maps. For example,
on Tgu1A the microsatellites span a predicted 24.4 Mbp
and the linkage distance is 15.8 cM, whereas a similar
region covering 21.7 Mbp is only 0.6 cM on the SNP map.
On linkage group Tgu1 (region spanning ~31.4 Mbp to
94.5 Mbp) the microsatellite map exhibits a recombina-
tion rate (0.143 cM Mb-1) more than 7 times greater than
the SNP map (0.02 cM Mb-1). The Tgu2 maps are more 
difficult to compare as both comprehensive maps exhibit
rearrangements compared to the genome sequence
(Additional file 2: Table S2). For these we used the distal
microsatellites according to the physical chromosome
positions and used the whole of the genetic map length to
estimate the recombination rate. As the marker order
with the highest likelihood is typically shorter than any
alternative order this should give a conservative estimate.
The microsatellite recombination rate (0.24 cM Mb-1)
was ten times greater than that predicted by the SNP map
(0.02 cM Mb-1).  This degree of inflation is worrying,
especially considering the attempts to control for the
influence of microsatellite typing error. For Tgu9 we also
estimated the recombination rates using the distal micro-
satellites according to the genome assembly. The maps
lengths were more similar but the recombination rate of
the microsatellite maps was still inflated (microsatellite
map = 2.22 cM Mb-1, SNP map = 1.75 cM Mb-1). In gen-
eral, the difference between SNP and microsatellite
recombination rates seems to be most pronounced in the
central parts of macro-chromosomes. This is logical, as
recombination in these regions is relatively rare, and
therefore the relative impact of spurious recombination
events caused by typing error will be greater than in
regions where true recombination events are more fre-
quent.
The degree of map inflation caused by microsatellites
was reduced, but still noticeable, when microsatellites

and SNPs were combined via the conventional build
method. In general, maps built from microsatellites and
SNPs were longer than SNP-only maps, even though the
microsatellites were only distal to the SNPs in the Tgu9
map (Figure 3). Tgu1: SNP map = 63.7 cM; SNP and mic-
rosatellite map = 89.2 cM; Tgu1A: SNP map = 63.3 cM,
SNP and microsatellite map = 83.2 cM; Tgu 2: SNP map =
34.7 cM, SNP and microsatellite map = 64.6 cM; Tgu 9:
SNP map = 60.5 cM, SNP and microsatellite map = 79.4
cM.
One conceivable explanation for the differences
between the microsatellite and SNP maps is that the pro-
portion of missing data was three times greater for micro-
satellties (15%) than SNPs (5%). This is unlikely to lead to
map inflation of the microsatellite maps as there is no
reason why missing genotypes should be biased with
respect to whether they affect recombinant or non-
recombinant meiotic events. To test this further we simu- 
lated 10 replicates of the LG1 SNP map (63.7 cM) with
15% missing data and then rebuilt the maps. The simu-
lated datasets had a mean map length almost identical to
the original (mean length = 64.1 cM; SE 0.9 cM). In other
words there was no evidence that map inflation of the
microsatellite maps was caused by a higher genotyping
failure rate. It is also worth noting that the greater vari-
ability of microsatellites means that they resulted in a
much higher number of informative meioses than the
SNPs (see Figure 1), which more than offsets the higher
failure rate.
The most likely explanation for the discrepancies in the
map lengths is the higher typing error rate of the micro-
satellites. It seems even after carefully checking for errors
and excluding error prone markers, recombination rate
appears inflated. This could be a phenomenon in many
microsatellite based linkage maps and needs to be consid-
ered when comparing linkage maps constructed from dif-
Figure 2 Separate SNP and microsatellite framework maps. Linkage maps built via the conventional method show that (A) marker order of mic-
rosatellites maps does not always correspond to the physical order on the zebra finch genome assembly (centre). However, for all four chromosomes
the order of maps built with only the SNP markers (B) does agree with the zebra finch assembly order. Framework maps with marker order supported
by LOD ≥ 3 are presented. Microsatellites are highlighted in red and linkage map positions are given in cM (A and B). The predicted genome assembly
positions for the markers (centre) are given in Mb.

ferent types of marker. Recently, a similar conclusion was
reached in a paper that combined SNP, microsatellite and
AFLP data to build a linkage map for the chicken genome
[23].  During construction of this high density linkage
map, 70% of the previously mapped markers (the majority
of which were microsatellites) had to be excluded from
the updated map (which mostly contained SNPs), as they
caused map inflation, despite rigorous error checking
when the microsatellite map was first constructed [24].
This phenomenon could be prevalent for many previ-
ously created microsatellite linkage maps and it seems
likely that subsequent high density SNP maps will reveal
many medium density microsatellite maps to be inflated.
(iii) Accuracy of marker order
To validate the marker order of SNP and microsatellite
maps, the zebra finch genome sequence assembly was
used as a template against which all linkage maps were
evaluated. It is important to note that the SNP map has
been used as a reference during the latter part of the
zebra finch sequence assembly process (for a more
detailed account of the zebra finch assembly process see
 http://genome.wustl.edu/pub/organism/
Other_Vertebrates/Taeniopygia_guttata/assembly/
 Taeniopygia_guttata-3.2.4/).  However, the degree to
which this has influenced the order of markers on the
physical map is thought to be negligible. As a precaution
we have also used assembled supercontigs as a reference
against which to compare orders of the different linkage
maps (see below). These supercontigs were created inde-
pendently of any linkage map and so provide a robust test
of the accuracy of map order, without any potential influ-
ence of the linkage map on the assembled zebra finch
sequence.
Very few of the comprehensive maps are in complete
agreement with the assembled genome sequence. It is
only the microsatellite map for Tgu1A and the SNP map
for Tgu9 that adhere completely to the sequence order.
This is not surprising, as by definition, the comprehen-
sive map may have a marker order with only marginally
stronger statistical support than the next most likely
order. Marker orders supported by a LOD <3.0 are not
generally regarded as definitive. Therefore, it is more
revealing to examine framework maps where the best
order is supported by a LOD ≥ 3 and is assumed to be
reliable. Here all the SNP maps are in complete agree-
ment with the genome assembly, but the order of three of
the four microsatellite maps differs from the genome
assembly (see Figure 2); the exception is Tgu1A, which
only includes 2 markers. This would indicate that even
the most conservative microsatellite maps are unreliable.
For example, ZF09-004, (estimated null frequency =
0.049, estimated error rate = 0.018) causes an apparent
inversion (relative to the physical assembly) on linkage
group Tgu9 which is not supported by the SNPs. Even 
after exclusion of errors and selection of markers with
less than 2% error rates, the microsatellite linkage maps
are not only inflated, but also exhibit different marker
orders to the known sequence.
In general, the SNPs-only and 'SNPs preceding micro-
satellites' maps provide a closer correspondence to the
genome assembly than the microsatellites-only and the
'SNPs & microsatellites conventional' maps (Additional
file 2: Table S2).  Examination of the framework maps
(marker order supported by a LOD ≥ 3) reveals that the
'SNPs preceding microsatellite' (Additional file 2: Table
S2) framework maps correspond to the genome assembly
for every chromosome, whereas the microsatellite-only
and the 'SNPs and microsatellites conventional' frame-
work maps generally do not (Additional file 2: Table S2).
The reason for these discrepancies is likely to be typing
error or null alleles at the microsatellites, which have pre-
viously been found to inflate linkage maps and support
incorrect marker orders [32].
It could be argued that because the SNP map was used
to help assemble the zebra finch genome its errors could
have been incorporated into the physical assembly,
thereby making the assembly an inappropriate reference
against which to compare the microsatellite and SNP
maps. To address this issue we compared the order of
markers in the "SNP only" and "Microsatellite only" maps
against the supercontig sequences which were created
independently of the linkage maps. These are assembled
genome sequences (n = 37,698) with an average length of
~10 Mb. For each framework marker (Figure 2) the
supercontig location (both the supercontig name and
position within that supercontig) was obtained via a
BLAST search of the zebra finch genome. Any supercon-
tigs that contained either ≥3 framework SNPs (4 contigs)
or microsatellites (1 contig) were used to investigate map
accuracy by comparing the order of markers on the link-
age maps and supercontigs. For all supercontigs contain-
ing ≥3 framework SNPs (Contig22 = 5 SNPs, Contig 2 = 4
SNPs, Contig43 = 3 SNPs and Contig41 = 3 SNPs) the
marker order was identical to the "SNP only" linkage map.
However, the 3 framework microsatellites with BLAST
positions on Contig 2, were ordered Ase44 - ZF02-128 -
ZF02-129 on the supercontig and ZF02-129 - Ase44 -
ZF02-128 on the "Microsatellite only" linkage map. This
further demonstrates the inability of the microsatellite
maps to infer the correct order of markers.
It should be acknowledged that some discrepancies
between the linkage maps and the physical genome
sequence could be indicative of mistakes in the assembly.
Genome assemblies are an ongoing process, and it is
likely that the zebra finch assembly will be improved as
more information becomes available, and possibly as the
chicken genome assembly improves. Limitations of the
zebra finch sequence assembly were apparent when per-

Figure 3 Inflation caused by adding microsatellites. Linkage maps created with (A) only the SNP markers are substantially shorter in length than
(B) linkage maps created using both SNP and microsatellite markers when the conventional build method is used. This inflation is exhibited in all four
chromosomes. Generally, the microsatellites (highlighted in red) are not distal to the SNP markers so the cause of the inflation is likely to be genotyping
error at the microsatellite markers.

forming BLAST searches; four SNP markers (SNP0444,
SNP0154, SNP0853 & SNP0018) had hits on the chicken
genome assembly to the chromosomes predicted by the
linkage maps, yet they fail to produce a hit on the zebra
finch genome sequence. As these SNPs have been iso-
lated and obtained from zebra finch DNA, it suggests that
the zebra finch genome assembly remains relatively
incomplete. Putative assembly errors however, cannot
explain the much greater recombination rates of the mic-
rosatellite maps, and there is no a priori reason to expect
inaccuracies in the assembly to affect marker order of
microsatellites but not SNPs.
Another key point to consider when assessing these
maps is that the greater marker density of the SNP maps,
make the detection of 'unusual' double recombinants
indicative of typing error more obvious. The problems
associated with microsatellites highlighted in this paper
may be less pronounced if more markers were typed,
although they are unlikely to disappear completely as evi-
denced by the map inflation of the high density combined
SNP and microsatellite maps, and by the previously unde-
tected map inflation observed on the high density micro-
satellite-based chicken linkage maps [23].
(iv) Comparisons of the 'SNPs and microsatellites
conventional' and 'SNPs preceding microsatellites' maps
When combined, the microsatellites and SNPs were
assigned to the predicted linkage groups based on their
known chicken and zebra finch assembly positions and
their earlier linkage map positions [40]. Interestingly, the
two different methods used for building maps gave quite
disparate map lengths (Figure 4, Additional file 2: Table
S2). The linkage maps built via the conventional method,
which typically means microsatellites are among the ear-
liest to be added to the map, were longer than the equiva-
lent maps that were constructed by adding microsatellites
to the SNP maps (Tgu1 11.8 cM longer, Tgu1A 0.9 cM
longer, Tgu2 10.2 cM longer, Tgu9 1.0 cM longer). Fur-
thermore, maps built by the conventional method had
marker orders supported by a lower likelihood (Tgu1 35.5
lower, Tgu1A 7.5 lower, Tgu2 87.0 lower, Tgu9 9.6 lower)
and showed more inconsistencies with the zebra finch
assembly order, suggesting that the conventional method
was more error prone than when mapping the SNPs first
(Figure 4, Additional file 2: Table S2).
It is likely that the combination of greater informative-
ness and higher errors of the microsatellites cause them
to be added first but in the wrong order. Subsequent addi-
tion of the SNPs fails to rectify the errors as the relatively
large number of SNPs (compared to microsatellites) ren-
ders the FLIPS5 command unable to resolve errors in
marker order between microsatellites separated by large
numbers of SNPs. FLIPS takes consecutive markers, reor-
ders them and produces likelihood scores for these differ-
ent orders. Due to computational constraints it is 
impractical to use FLIPS for greater than five markers.
What can happen in this situation is that a local likeli-
hood maxima is reached between a group of closely
linked markers such that no changes in the order of these
will give a better likelihood. However, if it was possible to
flip the order of more than 5 markers then a more accu-
rate order may be revealed.
One of the outcomes of this investigation is that the
conventional method of building linkage maps has to be
modified when using markers that differ significantly in
their number of informative meioses and error rates.
Markers with the lowest error rates should be included
first to provide an accurate foundation, to which other
markers can then be added. This may be especially
important for larger chromosomes as Tgu1, Tgu1A and
Tgu2 exhibited the largest differences between the two
construction methods, whereas the smaller chromosome
Tgu9 did not differ as substantially. It is possible that
those regions of macro-chromosomes with very low
recombination rates are most sensitive to typing error.
However this could also be due to the markers on Tgu9
exhibiting lower error rates, and investigation of addi-
tional smaller chromosomes would be needed to confirm
this observation.
Conclusions
This study highlights potential problems, as well as some
solutions, of linkage mapping construction with moder-
ately error prone markers. Although microsatellites are
informative, they can provide misleading results because
they have greater error rates than SNPs. Even with the
usual methods of error reduction and detection in micro-
satellite genotyping there is still potential for map infla-
tion and incorrect marker orders. The results of this
study emphasise the importance of careful examination
of CHROMPIC outputs to identify possible genotype
errors, which can create spurious double recombinants.
We also suggest that the least error prone markers (SNPs)
should be mapped before adding the microsatellites, at
least until it is computationally practical to FLIP greater
than 5 markers at a time.
This study has highlighted the importance of knowing
how much effect error rates have had on the final out-
come of a linkage map. With map inflation likely to be
present in other microsatellite-based studies, it remains
to be seen whether subsequent SNP mapping projects
will reveal previously undetected errors in map order or
length. However, although microsatellites are more error
prone than SNPs, their widespread availability, ease of
typing, high polymorphism and their cross-species utility
will ensure that they remain useful in linkage-mapping
studies, especially for comparing the genomes of non-
model organisms. In summary, we are not suggesting that
microsatellites should be abandoned in mapping studies,

(B) Maps created by the method where the SNP markers are mapped before the microsatellites. The maps produced by the 'SNPs preceding micro-
satellites' are more similar to the physical order of the markers in the genome assembly, which are shown in the centre. The microsatellite markers are
highlighted in red and the markers positioned at a LOD ≥ 3 are in bold, underlined font. To aid clarity, the markers on the linkage maps are shown at
equidistant positions along the chromosomes, although the total map lengths are shown on the same scale, illustrating the inflated lengths of the
