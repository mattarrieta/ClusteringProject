Abstract
Background: Steroids affect many tissues, including the brain. In the zebra finch, the estrogenic steroid estradiol
(E2
) is especially effective at promoting growth of the neural circuit specialized for song. In this species, only the
males sing and they have a much larger and more interconnected song circuit than females. Thus, it was
surprising that the gene for 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 4 (HSD17B4),  an enzyme that converts E2 
to a
less potent estrogen, had been mapped to the Z sex chromosome. As a consequence, it was likely that HSD17B4
was differentially expressed in males (ZZ) and females (ZW) because dosage compensation of Z chromosome
genes is incomplete in birds. If a higher abundance of HSD17B4 mRNA in males than females was translated into
functional enzyme in the brain, then contrary to expectation, males could produce less E2 
in their brains than
females.
Results: Here, we used molecular and biochemical techniques to confirm the HSD17B4 Z chromosome location in
the zebra finch and to determine that HSD17B4 mRNA and activity were detectable in the early developing and
adult brain. As expected, HSD17B4 mRNA expression levels were higher in males compared to females. This
provides further evidence of the incomplete Z chromosome inactivation mechanisms in birds. We detected
HSD17B4 mRNA in regions that suggested a role for this enzyme in the early organization and adult function of
song nuclei. We did not, however, detect significant sex differences in HSD17B4 activity levels in the adult brain.
Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that the HSD17B4 gene is expressed and active in the zebra finch brain as
an E2 
metabolizing enzyme, but that dosage compensation of this Z-linked gene may occur via post-transcriptional
mechanisms.
Background
Steroids have profound effects on the brain. In the zebra
finch (Taeniopygia guttata), regulation of the estrogenic
steroid estradiol (E2
) within the zebra finch brain may
have functional consequences for song behavior. In
zebra finches, males sing but females do not. Males also
have a larger and more interconnected set of brain
areas, or nuclei, specialized to learn and produce song
than females [1]. Early in development, E2 
masculinizes
the song circuit required for song production and in

adulthood, the function of song areas can be altered by
changes in E2 
after song experience [2-5].
The gonads do not supply the steroids that direct
masculinization of the song circuit, but the brain may
be an essential source of E2 
both during development
and in adulthood [6-24]. It is still unclear, however, how
steroids produced in the brain act on the song system
[17,24-28]. Therefore, two non-exclusive theories have
been proposed to explain the origin of sex differences in
this system: sex differences are caused by local differ-
ences in steroid synthesis in or near the song control
circuit [6,7,11-13,17], and sex differences are caused by
the differential effect of genes localized to sex chromo-
somes [29,30].

Evidence exists to support both theories. Many of the
major steroid -producing and -transducing factors that
can act on the song circuit are present in the zebra
finch brain [6,7,10,11,18,19,31-37]. For example, early
developmental E2 
administration to females acts in the
brain to induce a masculine song circuit and the closer
the source of steroids is to a song nucleus the more
potent its effect, cultured brain slices produce E2 
and
manipulations of E2 
levels and estrogen receptor action
in these slices prevent full masculinization of song cir-
cuitry, and the E2
-synthetic enzyme aromatase is present
in presynaptic terminals within major song nuclei; in
fact, in adult male zebra finches, the brain is the major
source of E2 
[2,8,9,15,16,38-42]. On the other hand, in
vivo manipulations of E2 
synthesis and action in males
does not consistently significantly de-masculinize the
song system, the song circuit in genetic females is not
masculinized by the presence of functional steroid-
secreting testes, and the song nuclei within the male
hemisphere of a naturally-occurring gynandromorph
(one half genetically male, one half genetically female)
are larger than those in the genetically female hemi-
sphere [22,25,28,42-46]. Although in some cases, these
findings are partially consistent with the neural steroid
synthesis hypothesis, they primarily suggest that genetic
differences between males and females contribute to the
masculine development of the song system.
Indeed, in mammals and in zebra finches, data is
accumulating that male brain cells are fundamentally
different than female cells by virtue of their different
complement of sex chromosomes: XX/XY in mamma-
lian females and males, and ZW/ZZ in avian females
and males, respectively. There is evidence that genes on
the sex chromosomes might influence sexual differentia-
tion of the zebra finch song system [25,30,47-50]. The
potential for sex chromosome genes to display sex dif-
ferences in expression levels is especially high in the
zebra finch because sex chromosome dosage compensa-
tion is largely ineffective in birds at the mRNA level
[51-53].
Here, we examine 17b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
type 4 (HSD17B4), a steroidogenic enzyme that converts
E2 
to a less potent estrogen, estrone (E1
). Inasmuch as
HSD17B4 is present and active in particular brain
regions, it could regulate the local concentrations of E2
.
This could impact the organization and function of the
song circuit [12,13,24,50,54-56]. Previous experiments
have shown evidence that HSD17B4 is localized to the
Z chromosome and has a male-biased sex difference in
brain expression levels across development [50,57].
HSD17B4 therefore represents a convergence of the
steroidal and genetic theories of song system sexual dif-
ferentiation. All of this also suggests, however, that E2
might be less available to the male brain, a prediction 
contrary to findings that E2 
masculinizes the song
system.
We therefore used several techniques to examine
HSD17B4 DNA, mRNA, and enzyme activity in male
and female zebra finch brains. We used posthatch day 5
(P5) and adult birds because at both ages, E2 
meaning-
fully impacts the song system. P5 is within the period
when steroid administration has the greatest masculiniz-
ing effect on song nuclei, other steroid-synthesizing
genes are expressed in the brain at this early age, and it
is just prior to the earliest emergence of identifiable
song control nuclei [6,11,38,58,59]. Thus expression of
HSD17B4 at this early age could alter the local steroid
environment that contributes to the initial organization
of song nuclei. In adulthood, measures in song nuclei
show the potential for rapid and synaptic regulation of
estradiol synthesis, which could have functional conse-
quences for song production and perception [2-5]. Our
results show that HSD17B4 is sexually dimorphic and
could impact both developing and mature song nuclei,
consistent with a previous report, and that dosage com-
pensation of HSD17B4 gene may act at a post-transcrip-
tional level [50].  It will require further study to
understand how these dosage compensation mechan-
isms affect neural steroid production, and therefore
organization and function of the sexually dimorphic
song control circuit.
Results
Zebra finch HSD17B4 gene and cDNA sequences
We used two independently cloned cDNAs as probes
for the molecular experiments. The clone used for
Bacterial Artificial Clone (BAC) library screening, and
Northern and Southern blot hybridizations was an
Expressed Sequence Tag (EST; GenBank Accession
No. CK313884) cloned by the Songbird Neuroge-
nomics Initiative (SoNG) as part of its transcriptome
project [60]. Based on alignment with the zebra finch
HSD17B4 gene model (below),  this cDNA includes
sequence beginning at exon 14 through the end of the
transcript and therefore spans part of the hydratase-
dehydrogenase epimerase (HDE) domain, the entire
sterol carrier protein 2 (SCP2) domain [61,62] and the
3’-UTR (Figure 1).  The comparison of zebra finch,
chicken, human, mouse and zebra fish predicted amino
acid sequences showed that there is high conservation
along HDE and SCP2 domains (range of 56%-90%
identity across both domains for this subset of species
comparisons; Figure 1).
Prior to the SoNG EST project, we had cloned a
HSD17B4 cDNA that we used as the riboprobe template
for our brain in situ hybridization experiments. The
sequence of this clone spans almost exactly the same
region of gene as the SoNG EST except that it begins

Confirmation of Z chromosome localization
We examined the intensity of hybridization on a South-
ern blot that contained male and female genomic DNA
and to test if we could detect a sex difference in
HSD17B4 gene abundance. To control for the possibility
that gene products derived from one enzyme digestion
could provide spurious results, we digested the genomic
DNA with two enzymes, HaeII and HindIII, which
results in two different banding patterns (Figure 2A).
The male and female DNA showed virtually the same
pattern of hybridized DNA fragments when digested
with the same enzyme, with the exception of light-
appearing bands that are visible in the male sample but
not the female sample (Figure 2A). In cases when DNA
products are visible in both male and female samples,
the male bands appear to show darker hybridization sig-
nals than the corresponding female band. This suggests
that the apparent sex difference in DNA digest products
likely reflects the detection limit of the blot, not a biolo-
gical difference in DNA content. The fact that hybridi-
zation showed stronger signals in the male DNA, almost
twice the signal as from hybridization to the female
DNA sample, suggests more copies of the gene in males
than females (Figure 2A). The lack of a female-specific
35 bp after the EST at the 5’  end of the gene and
extends 55 bp further than the EST at 3’ end. The high
level of cDNA sequence conservation across species,
including essential functional domains, demonstrated
that both cDNAs used in subsequent molecular experi-
ments are almost certainly specific for HSD17B4.
To further confirm that the molecular tools we used
were indeed HSD17B4, we examined the cDNA clone
sequences in relation to the gene sequence in the zebra
finch genome assembly. Using the Apollo Genome
Annotation Curation Tool, we manually annotated the
zebra finch DNA sequence from the genome assembly,
the nucleotide sequences of the two clones we used for
experiments, and other available transcript sequences to
confirm the HSD17B4 gene model [63,64](Figure 1). In
the zebra finch assembly, the gene was mapped to chro-
mosome Z:24,439,644-24,502,076. As in the human
gene, the zebra finch gene model contains 24 coding
exons, although we were unable to predict the precise

samples, the blot showed bands of stronger signal in males than
females, suggesting Z chromosome linkage of HSD17B4. (B) Z
chromosome localization of HSD17B4 sequence confirmed by FISH
analysis. Individual fluorescently stained chromosomes are in the
background, and two distinct, sharp hybridization signals over the Z
chromosome show label on the two copies of the HSD17B4 gene
(arrowhead).  The Z-linked 094L04 BAC probe encoding HSD17B4
also cross-hybridized to the W chromosome, suggesting that it
contains repetitive sequences such as ZBM that are present on both
Z and W [67].  Scale bar = 10 μm.

band in the Southern blot also suggests that the W
chromosome does not have sequences homologous to
CK313884.
To confirm the Z chromosome localization of
HSD17B4 gene, we used the EST to first screen a zebra
finch BAC library [URL: "http://www.genome.arizona.edu"] http://www.genome.arizona.edu to
isolate a larger genomic clone to be used as the Fluores-
cent In situ Hybridization (FISH) probe [52].  The
selected BAC clone, 094L04, encompassed HSD17B4
and mapped to the short arm of zebra finch Z chromo-
some by FISH (Figure 2B). The HSD17B4 BAC clone
also cross-hybridized to the W chromosome, suggesting
that the BAC clone contained the zebra finch ZBM (W
chromosome repeat sequence)-  related sequence
[52,66,67].
Northern blot hybridization shows sex difference in
mRNA levels
Northern blot hybridization for male and female whole
brain or gonads showed higher expression of HSD17B4
gene in males relative to females (Figure 3). In both the
brain and gonads, the male:female ratio of the density of
HSD17B4 hybridization was 1.7. In the brain samples,
we could confirm that this sex bias was not due to over-
all differences in RNA levels loaded onto the blot; the
male:female ratio of GAPDH control hybridization was
1.1. A similar control measure could not be obtained for
the gonads because GAPDH expression levels can differ
across tissues and the results here are consistent with
previous reports that the zebra finch testes express
higher levels of GAPDH than ovaries [68].
Sex differences and song system localization of HSD17B4
mRNA
In situ hybridization confirmed the presence of
HSD17B4 mRNA in the brains of both males and
females, at P5 and in adulthood. Brain sections hybri-
dized with the antisense probe showed widespread label-
ing of cells that express HSD17B4 (Figure 4).  As
expected, sections hybridized with the negative control
sense-configured probes showed no label (Figure 4).
At P5, we detected HSD17B4 hybridization throughout
the telencephalon and in the area that resembled the lat-
eral magnocellular nucleus of the nidopallium (LMAN)
in male and female brains. This was the only brain area
that resembled a song nucleus that was visible at this
young age, based on its neuroanatomical position and
boundaries (Figure 4). There was no significant sex dif-
ference in hybridization density measurements of the
entire telencephalon (p = 0.072). Within the presumptive
LMAN region of P5 birds, however, t-tests showed there
was a significant sex difference (male greater than female)
in HSD17B4 hybridization intensity (p = 0.021). 
Figure 3 Northern blot hybridization shows sex difference in
HSD17B4 mRNA levels. A Northern blot of brain and gonad total
RNA from male (M) and female (F) zebra finches was hybridized
with a 32P-labeled [URL: "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/313884?dopt=Abstract"] CK313884 probe. The blot shows that the band
from the male brain sample is 1.7 times the intensity of that from
the female brain sample, suggesting male higher expression of
HSD17B4 mRNA. The control GAPDH hybridization indicates that the
amount of male and female RNA loaded was roughly equivalent in
the brain. The testicular and ovarian samples also show differential
expression levels of HSD17B4, but GAPDH is likely expressed at
higher levels in the testes than the ovaries, and therefore was not
used as a loading control in these tissues [68].
We also detected HSD17B4 mRNA in the adult male
HVC (used as a proper name) nucleus of the song cir-
cuit, though we were unable to perform a quantitative
sex comparison because HVC was not reliably identified
in comparable sections in females (Figure 4). Hybridiza-
tion label in other song areas present in both males
and females (LMAN and the robust nucleus of the
arcopallium, RA) were not greater than the surrounding
telencephalon. Therefore, we analyzed HSD17B4 hybri-
dization intensities on the entire left and right
telencephalic lobes in sections that spanned the entire
rostral-caudal extent. This analysis revealed significantly
higher hybridization levels in the telencephalon of males
than of females (p = 0.016).

(arrows denote area of HVC but no detectable hybridization), but the telencephalic levels of HSD17B4 expression were significantly (p = 0.016)
higher in adult males than females. Scale bar in A = 1 mm (applies to A-D), scale bar in E = 1 mm (applies to E, F).
HSD17B4 activity does not show a sex difference
Several initial experiments were performed to first opti-
mize the conditions for the final biochemical assess-
ments of HSD17B4 activity in the brain. A timecourse
experiment showed that a 5 minute incubation was opti-
mal for accurately measuring HSD17B4 activity (Figure
5A). Presence of an E1 
cold trap decreased the detect-
able conversion of E2 
to E1 
approximately two-fold (Fig-
ure 5B).  Therefore, cold trap was not used in
subsequent experiments. Lastly, a concentration gradient
determined that 50 nM 3H-E2 
was the optimum sub-
strate concentration for measuring HSD17B4 activity
after 5 minutes of incubation (Figure 5B). 
Using the optimized conditions, we first analyzed
HSD17B4 activity in the telencephalon and diencepha-
lon of adult male and female birds. Two-way ANOVA
for sex, region and the sex by region interaction showed
that there was no significant overall effect of sex (p =
0.745), brain region (p = 0.206), or the interaction (p =
0.263) on HSD17B4 activity levels (Figure 6A).
In a separate set of birds, we performed another assay
for HSD17B4 activity in two telencephalic regions that
contained brain regions that in situ hybridization and
Northern blot results suggested would have HSD17B4
activity (dorsomedial telencephalon, “DT” and caudo-
dorsal telencephalon, “CT"; details of the dissections in

Methods), diencephalon, and gonads (Figure 6B, C). In
this experiment, we found that the gonads contained
significantly more HSD17B4 activity than the brain (p <
0.001). When the three brain areas were then analyzed
for effects of age, sex, and their interaction, we found
again that sex had no significant main effect on
HSD17B4 activity levels (p = 0.323). Individual t-tests
for the effect of sex within each of the three brain areas
also did not detect a sex difference in any individual
region (DT: p = 0.362, CT: p = 0.151, diencephalon: p =
0.106). In this assay, we did detect a significant main
effect of brain area (p = 0.001).  Post-hoc analysis
demonstrated that the effect of brain area was due to
higher levels of HSD17B4 activity in the diencephalon
compared to the two telencephalic regions. Further,
there was a significant interaction between sex and
brain area (p = 0.043). The interaction occurred because

Discussion
Estradiol is a potent masculinizing steroid for the devel-
opmental growth of the sexually dimorphic song circuit
in the zebra finch. Estradiol also continues to impact
the function of song regions in adult birds [69]. Unlike
most sexually dimorphic systems, gonadal secretions do
not control song circuit masculinization. Consequently,
two non-exclusive theories have been proposed to
explain the sex difference in the song circuit: the neural
production of steroids and the differential expression of
sex chromosome genes in the brain. Here, we examined
HSD17B4, an E2
-metabolizing enzyme mapped to the Z
sex chromosome, as an example of how these two the-
ories might converge.
We confirmed the Z chromosome localization of the
HSD17B4 gene, and that the abundance of HSD17B4
DNA and brain mRNA is approximately two-times
greater in males a than in females, consistent with pre-
vious reports [50,57]. Based on in situ hybridization
signal distributions here and in a previous study, it
may be that HSD17B4 has a specific role in the sexual
differentiation and function of the song circuit. Here,
we showed that in the first week of posthatch develop-
ment when E2 
is most effective for masculinizing the
song nuclei, HSD17B4 expression is detectable in the
P5 brain and expression levels are higher in an area
that appears to be LMAN in males than in females. If
this is indeed LMAN, it would be the earliest identifi-
cation of this nucleus in the zebra finch. Further, the
LMAN expression appears to be developmentally regu-
lated; in P25 birds, HSD17B4 hybridization intensity in
LMAN was also higher than in the adjacent telence-
phalic tissue but there was no significant sex difference
within the song nucleus, and by adulthood, label was
not noticeably greater in LMAN than in the surround-
ing brain [50].  In contrast, we were able to detect
HSD17B4 mRNA in the HVC of adult males (but not
females), where HSD17B4 mRNA has been shown to
be significantly enriched compared to the surrounding
telencephalon in P25 and adult males [50,70].  This
song nucleus also contains synaptic aromatase that can
be modulated by song production, thus both aromatase
and HSD17B4 may together regulate the availability of
E2 
in the adult HVC [2,4,39]. 
The higher levels of HSD17B4 expression in the male
brain compared to the female brain, in particular within
song control nuclei, were counterintuitive given exten-
sive evidence that E2 
masculinizes these areas [24].
Nevertheless, the higher expression of HSD17B4 mRNA
in males than females was consistent with previous find-
ings that many Z chromosome genes are poorly dosage
compensated in birds; the majority of genes on the Z
chromosome show higher mRNA levels in males (ZZ)
than females (ZW) [51,66]. The incomplete dosage com-
pensation in birds differs strikingly from the effective
dosage compensation patterns found in other species
[48,66]. It is generally accepted, however, that dosage
compensation is critical and ubiquitous among species
with heteromorphic sex chromosomes like the avian Z
and W [48,71-73]. Thus, it was possible that dosage
compensation could occur via post-transcriptional
mechanisms in the zebra finch.
We therefore assayed the activity levels of HSD17B4
in adult brains. Our results demonstrate that this
enzyme is active in metabolizing E2 
in the zebra finch.
However, in two major brain regions and in two experi-
ments, the conversion of E2 
to E1 
was not significantly
different between adult males and females - the sex dif-
ference in HSD17B4 mRNA levels in the adult brain
does not translate into a sex difference in activity levels.
Therefore, while the neuroanatomical mapping of
HSD17B4 mRNA suggested that this enzyme may influ-
ence the sex-specific organization and function of the
song control circuit by reducing the availability of E2 
in
males, our biochemical results indicate that post-tran-
scriptional mechanisms may regulate neural HSD17B4
activity to minimize the sex difference found in
HSD17B4 expression levels.
Perhaps regulatory mechanisms that are known to
modify enzyme activity, such as phosphorylation and
availability of substrate or cofactors, could explain our
results. These factors might override the tendency for
greater enzyme activity based on the male bias in
mRNA abundance. Enzymes in particular have been the-
orized to be relatively dosage insensitive because their
function is often more strongly dependent on properties
other than the copy number of the genes encoding
them [74]. Steroidogenic enzyme regulation may have
been especially relevant to the evolution of an E2
-sensi-
tive neural circuit such as the zebra finch song system.
The precise mechanisms that control, and the functional
significance of, this region-specific regulation of
HSD17B4 activity remains to be discovered.
Conclusions
HSD17B4 is a Z-linked enzyme that shows a sex differ-
ence in DNA dose and mRNA expression levels, but not

in activity levels. The post-transcriptional regulation of
HSD17B4 may signal that E2 
metabolism is tightly con-
trolled in the brains of both male and female zebra
finches.
Methods
All zebra finches were obtained from colonies housed in
the UCLA Life Science Vivarium. The Chancellor’s Ani-
mal Research Committee approved all protocols.
HSD17B4 gene and cDNA clone annotation
Two zebra finch HSD17B4 cDNA clones were indepen-
dently produced and used for probe templates in subse-
quent experiments. We cloned one cDNA from zebra
finch brain using PCR and plasmid cloning techniques
as previously described [6]. Primers used to amplify the
cDNA were: S: 5’-TTTTCCACCCAAGAGACCCC-3’
AS: 5’-TGGCATAGTCTTTCAGGATCATTTC-3’. This
clone was used as the riboprobe template for in situ
hybridization experiments. After we had obtained this
clone, the Songbird Neurogenomics Initiative (SoNG)
cloned a HSD17B4 expressed sequence tag as part of a
brain transcriptome project (EST; GenBank Accession
No. CK313884) [60]. We obtained this clone and used it
for the probe template for BAC library screening, South-
ern blot and Northern blot hybridizations. We com-
pared the sequence of the two cDNA clones to
determine that they largely overlap and therefore pro-
vided comparable measures of HSD17B4 DNA and
mRNA across the experiments.
At the time both clones were produced, their identi-
ties as HSD17B4 sequences were based on homology
matches to genes in other species such as human and
chicken. To do this, we aligned the predicted amino
acid sequence of the EST to the predicted amino acid
sequence of the human, chicken, zebra fish and mouse
HSD17B4 genes to assess the extent that the zebra finch
sequence shares sequence and functional domain motifs
with known HSD17B4 genes from other species.
Recently, the zebra finch genome has been sequenced
and assembled [64]. Therefore, to further confirm the
clone identities, we compared their nucleotide sequences
to a model of the zebra finch gene sequence we con-
structed from the genome assembly. To create this
model, we used DNA sequence from the zebra finch
genome assembly, the EST sequence from the ESTIMA
database and the sequence of our cloned cDNA, the set
of RefSeq GenBank entries from other species, and the
predicted human HSD17B4 protein coding sequence.
With this information, we manually curated the
HSD17B4 predicted gene sequence and structure in the
Apollo Genome Annotation Curation Tool [63]. We
then aligned the zebra finch brain cDNA clone
sequences to the genomic sequence to identify the gene 
region included in the clones; we show the structural
alignment of the gene to the SoNG EST sequence here.
Southern blot hybridization
Zebra finch genomic DNA for Southern blot analysis
was isolated from heparinized blood. Briefly, the nuclei
of blood cells were suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.0), 100 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) and incubated in the pre-
sence of 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 100 μg/ml
proteinase K at 50°C overnight. The mixture was
extracted successively with phenol saturated with TE
[10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA] and chloro-
form. The supernatant was ethanol precipitated, washed
with 70% ethanol and resolved in TE. The purified
genomic DNA was stored at 4°C until use.
Male or female genomic DNA was digested HindIII or
HaeIII, then electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel, 1×
TAE (4 μg/lane). The gel was denatured with 0.5 M
NaOH-1.5 M NaCl for 30 minutes, rinsed in water and
neutralized in 1 M Tris (pH 7.6)-1.5 M NaCl for 30
minutes. After another wash in 20× SSC for 20 minutes,
the gel was transferred to MAGNA Nylon Transfer
membrane (Osmonics Inc, Minnetonka, MN) in 20×
SSC overnight. The membrane was washed in 2× SSC,
dried and baked at 80°C, then UV cross linked. The
DNA for probes was agarose gel purified from restric-
tion enzyme digested plasmids using the Gene Clean kit
(Q-BIOgene, Solon, OH). Hybridization with a 32P-
labeled DNA probe was carried out in a hybridization
buffer [0.5 mol/L Na-phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 7%
SDS, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1% BSA (A3059, Sigma, St.
Louis, MO)] at 65°C overnight. The membrane was
washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 1
minute twice and 65°C for 30 minutes twice, and then
subjected to autoradiography.
Hybridization was performed with an expressed
sequence tag (EST) clone from the ESTIMA database
(GenBank Accession No. CK313884) that was identified
as HSD17B4. Before using CK313884 as a probe in any
of these experiments, we first confirmed its identity by
comparing it to known HSD17B4 sequences in other
species and confirming known conserved functional
domains (MOTIF, [URL: "http://motif.genome.jp/"] http://motif.genome.jp/.
Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)
The HSD17B4 zebra finch bacterial artificial chromo-
some (BAC) clone, 094L04, was isolated from a zebra
finch BAC library made by the Arizona Genomics
Institute [URL: "http://www.genome.arizona.edu"] http://www.genome.arizona.edu after hybridi-
zation with CK313884 probe. Isolation of BAC DNA,
chromosome preparation and FISH to mitotic chromo-
somes prepared from zebra finch fibroblasts were car-
ried out according to the methods of Itoh and Arnold
[75].

Northern blot hybridization
RNAs for male and female adult zebra finch brain or
gonads were isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) according to manufacturer’s instructions, and
stored at -80°C until use. RNA samples (8 μg/lane) were
subjected to denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and
capillary transferred to a MAGNA Nylon Transfer
membrane (Osmonics Inc) in 10× SSC. The membrane
was hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe based on
CK313884, in the same hybridization buffer used for
Southern blot hybridization (above),  at 68°C for 12
hours. After hybridization, the membrane was washed in
2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 minutes
twice, 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 37°C for 15 minutes twice
and 65°C for 15 minutes twice, and finally subjected to
autoradiography. After hybridization for HSD17B4, the
blots were stripped and re-hybridized for GAPDH as an
RNA loading control.
The density of the bands for brain and gonad samples
was quantified in Image J [URL: "http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/"] http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/. The
density of the region of the blot surrounding the band
was subtracted from the density of the hybridized band
to normalize for any differences in background. This
process was performed for bands hybridized with the
HSD17B4 probe and the GAPDH probe. We report
male:female density ratios except in the case of GADPH
hybridization to the gonads, which was higher in testes
than in ovaries, as in a previous report [68].
In situ hybridization and analysis
P5 and adult brains were collected, flash frozen, and
stored at -80°C until use. Delicate P5 brains were
retained in the skull to prevent damage from dissection.
Both male and female brains from each age (n = 4 per
sex for P5, n = 6 per sex for adults) were sectioned to
20 μm for in situ hybridization. The sex of P5 birds was
verified with visual inspection of the gonads. Prior to
hybridization, slides were dried at room temperature for
1 hour, then processed as previously described in Lon-
don et al., 2003 [6]. Male and female sections from each
age were processed together to facilitate quantitative
comparisons of male and female hybridization levels at
P5 and adult. Slides were hybridized overnight at 60°C
with 4 × 106 cpm of either antisense- or sense- config-
ured 33P-UTP labeled riboprobes. The probe template
was a 761 bp zebra finch HSD17B4 clone independently
created from the EST described above, but that overlaps
with nucleotides 36-796 of the CK313884 sequence.
After hybridization, slides were washed and dehy-
drated as previously described [6]. The high stringency
wash was performed at 63°C for 30 minutes. Slides were
dried at room temperature at least 2 hours, then
exposed to Kodak MR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY).
Film was exposed for ~17 hours for adult brains, 
~4 days for P5 brains at room temperature, before
developing. Slides were subsequently dipped in liquid
photographic emulsion, developed 9-10 days later, dehy-
drated and coverslipped.
To quantify optical density of select brain regions,
digital pictures of film exposures were first converted to
grayscale in Adobe Photoshop, then the average density
of each region was measured in Scion Image [URL: "http://www.scioncorp.com/pages/scion_image_windows.htm"] http://
 www.scioncorp.com/pages/scion_image_windows.htm.
Background density was also measured and subtracted
from the original density, giving the overall mean den-
sity. Quantification of telencephalic hybridization inten-
sities was performed on a  series of sections
approximately 100 μm apart that spanned the rostral to
caudal extent of the telencephalon; the entire lobe of
the telencephalon was included from both left and right
hemispheres in all sections that contained telencepha-
lon. This data was then analyzed with t-tests (SSPS,
SSPS Inc., Chicago, IL) to test for significant sex differ-
ences in hybridization intensities.
Image production
In situ hybridization images from BioMax MR films
were captured with a Zeiss Stemi 2000-C dissecting
scope mounted with an AxioCam MRc digital camera
with MRGrab 1.0 software (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood,
NY). Southern and Northern blot film images were cap-
tured by scanning into an EPSON Expression 800
flatbed scanner.
HSD17B4 activity
To measure HSD17B4 activity in brain tissues, we used
the core biochemical procedure previously described for
other steroidogenic enzymes [19,22,30,39,40,76-78].
Briefly, tissue was homogenized in sucrose phosphate
buffer (pH 9.0). Aliquots from the homogenates are
added to 3 mM nicotinamide adenine dinucleiotide
(NAD+) cofactor and tritiated E2
(3H-E2
) substrate, and
incubated at 41°C. Enzymatic activity was stopped by
flash freezing. Steroids were purified from proteins via
repeated ether extractions. To separate individual ster-
oids, samples were spotted on thin layer chromatogra-
phy (TLC) plates after the addition of non-radiolabeled
E1 
and E2 
to facilitate steroid visualization. TLC plates
were resolved in a 3:1 ether:hexane mixture. Separated
bands identified as E1 
and E2 
from standard samples
were scraped from the TLC plates, eluted into methanol,
and 3H-estrogens were directly quantified in a liquid
scintillation counter. To normalize the quantity of ster-
oid produced to the mass of protein in each sample, a
Bradford protein assay was performed with the protein
fraction of the homogenates. All sample tubes were run
in triplicate, and “S” tubes that contained no tissue and
an “R” tube that contained only 3H-E2 
were included to
Page 10

Page 10 of 12
assay background levels of metabolite and percent
recovery of steroids, respectively. The total quantity of
3H-E1 
synthesized in each reaction was calculated by
subtracting background values from the total 3H-E1
counts per minute (cpm) for each sample, and dividing
this value by the percent recovery of each assay. Values
are reported as femtomoles of 3H-steroid per microgram
of protein (fmol E1
/μg protein).
Since the activity levels of HSD17B4 enzyme have not
previously been studied in the zebra finch, we first per-
formed several experiments to optimize conditions for
its measurement. To determine the most accurate per-
iod of tissue incubation, we performed a timecourse
experiment. We used two adult female whole brains,
and after homogenization, samples were incubated with
100 nM 3H-E2 
and incubated at 41°C for 10, 30, or 90
minutes. Results were plotted to determine a time of
linear activity levels. To determine if the addition of an
E1 
“cold trap,” radioinert E1
, would enhance the detec-
tion of 3H-E1 
by limiting the conversion of 3H-E1 
to
other steroid products, 1 μg E1 
was added to half of the
tubes in a preliminary experiment. Lastly, to determine
the optimal 3H-E2 
concentration to use for substrate, a
female whole brain was incubated in the presence of 10,
50, 100, or 300 nM 3H-E2 
and processed as above.
Utilizing the conditions determined by preliminary
experiments (5 minute incubation with 100 nM 3H-E2
and no cold trap), we then performed two experiments
to measure the HSD17B4 activity in dissected brain
areas. First, we assayed HSD17B4 levels in the telence-
phalon and diencephalon of adult males and females (n
= 5 per sex). Second, we further dissected the telence-
phalon into two parts: the dorsomedial telencephalon
("DT,” tissue between the midline and 2 mm lateral to
midline starting 5 mm from the rostral tip of the brain
and terminating 5 mm from the caudal end of the tele-
ncephalon, a region that contains the hippocampus and
lateral ventricles), and the caudodorsal telencephalon
("CT,” a 1.5 mm deep section containing the caudal half
of the dorsal telencephalon that contains HVC). We
also assayed the diencephalon, ovaries and testes from
each bird (n = 5 per sex, except CT n = 4 per sex due
to technical issues). One- and two-way ANOVA and
Tukey post-hoc tests (SPSS) were used to test for effects
of sex and brain region on HSD17B4 activity.
