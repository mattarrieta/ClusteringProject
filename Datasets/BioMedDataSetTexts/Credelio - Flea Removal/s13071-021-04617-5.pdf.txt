Abstract 
Background:  Studies show that the novel isoxazoline, lotilaner (Credelio™ CAT; Elanco Animal Health), which is
administered orally to cats, provides rapid and sustained flea kill for least 1 month following administration with a
wide safety margin. A clinical trial was undertaken to confirm its efficacy, impact on flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) and
safety under field conditions.
Methods:  A total of 343 cats were enrolled in the study at 11 veterinary clinics in the USA. Upon inclusion, cat
households were randomized at a ratio of 2:1 to receive lotilaner tablets at the recommended dose (minimum 6
mg/kg) or a topical formulation containing fipronil + S-methoprene (Frontline® Plus for cats; Boehringer Ingelheim),
administered per label. Owners were dispensed treatments for administration on days 0, 30 and 60; all household
cats were administered the same treatment. Flea counts were made on primary cats (1 cat per household) on days 0
(pre-treatment), 30, 60 and 90. Flea allergy dermatitis was assessed on days 30, 60 and 90 for all cats with signs of FAD
on day 0. Lotilaner-treated cats were also assessed for their acceptance of oral tablet administration by the pet owner, 
and safety was assessed for all cats in both groups.
Results:  Lotilaner efficacy was 98.3, 99.9 and 99.9% on days 30, 60 and 90, respectively, while the efficacy of fipronil
+ S-methoprene was 61.6, 75.4 and 84.7%, respectively (P < 0.0001, within both groups and all days). Flea counts were
significantly lower in the lotilaner group than in the fipronil + S-methoprene group (P < 0.0001) on each assessment
day. On day 90, 98.3% of lotilaner-treated cats and 28.8% of fipronil + S-methoprene-treated cats were free of fleas. 
Owners successfully administered 99.5% of tablets to their cats. Total FAD score was reduced significantly follow-
ing treatment in both groups by day 30 (lotilaner: P < 0.0001; fipronil + S-methoprene: P = 0.0041) and continued to
decrease following multiple treatments. Total FAD scores were also significantly lower in the lotilaner group than in
the fipronil + S-methoprene group on day 90 (P = 0.0006 for FAD total score). Pruritus scores were significantly lower
in the lotilaner group on all assessment days.
Conclusion:  A single lotilaner treatment, administered by the pet owner, was > 98% efficacious in reducing flea
counts within 30 days. Three consecutive monthly lotilaner treatments resulted in nearly 100% reduction in flea

infestation. In the evaluations of flea counts, number of cats free from fleas and pruritus FAD score, lotilaner was
shown to be superior to fipronil + S-methoprene at all time points. Lotilaner was more efficacious than fipronil +
S-methoprene and was associated with greater reduction in FAD signs. Lotilaner flavored tablets were well accepted
by cats. Adverse reactions were mild and infrequent, confirming the safety of lotilaner tablets in client-owned cats.

Background
In much of the world, the cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis)
is the most commonly encountered ectoparasite of cats
and dogs [1]. In addition to being a nuisance and irritant, 
uncontrolled flea populations can cause miliary derma-
titis, self-inflicted trauma, alopecia due to pruritus and
anemia, as well as more severe dermatological conditions
including flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) [1, 2]. The injec-
tion of antigens present in flea saliva as the parasite feeds
can cause a hypersensitive state in some cats, and once
sensitization occurs, dermatologic lesions can recru-
desce following reinfestation [2]. Fleas are known vectors
of zoonotic organisms, such as Rickettsia spp. and Bar-
tonella spp., and serve as intermediate hosts of the tape-
worm Dipylidium caninum, adult stages of which have
been reported to develop in children upon ingestion of
infected fleas from infested animals [1, 3]. In the absence
of control measures, flea infestations can contaminate
household environments, leading to potential flea bites of
human occupants [4].
Female fleas begin laying eggs within 24 to 36 h after
finding a host, and they can lay as many as 50 eggs per
day. Cat fleas can survive more than 100 days on a host, 
with continued daily egg production [5]. Flea eggs fall
from the animal host, feeding the cycle of immature
flea life stages in the host’s environment and sustaining
the infestation. Environmental pesticides employed to
eliminate flea populations from households may not be
effective and their use exposes household inhabitants
to pesticide residues [6]. An appropriate control strategy
for fleas and flea infestations therefore includes the use of
products that eliminate existing fleas on pets and protect
against post-treatment challenges from flea life stages
present in a contaminated environment.
Lotilaner, a novel isoxazoline, provides veterinarians
and pet owners with an effective, fast-acting and long-
lasting measure to control feline flea infestations. In
a margin of safety study, lotilaner was well tolerated by
kittens 8 weeks old at study start, at doses of up to 130
mg/kg (corresponding to 5-fold the maximum recom-
mended dose), administered monthly over 8 months [7].
Results from laboratory efficacy studies demonstrate that
lotilaner starts killing fleas on cats within 6 to 8 h after
administration [8, 9], and an efficacy of 100% against fleas 
was demonstrated through to the end of the study (35
days after treatment initiation), indicating that monthly
use of lotilaner will effectively eliminate flea life-cycle
stages from the cat’s environment [8].
The field study described here was designed to con-
firm the results of prior laboratory efficacy and safety
studies. The primary study objective was to evaluate the
efficacy and safety of lotilaner flavored chewable tablets
administered orally by cat owners at the recommended
dose (minimum 6 mg/kg) for the treatment and pre-
vention of flea infestations. Secondary study objectives
were to evaluate the presence and persistence of clinical
signs associated with FAD (pruritus, erythema, scaling, 
papules, alopecia and dermatitis/pyodermatitis) and to
evaluate the oral administration acceptance of the tablet
formulation.
Methods
This was a randomized, blinded, positive controlled field
study in cats enrolled by participating veterinary prac-
tices across the USA. The protocol was prepared in com-
pliance with the World Association for the Advancement
of Veterinary Parasitology (WAAVP) guidelines for eval-
uating the efficacy of parasiticides for the treatment, pre-
vention and control of flea and tick infestation on dogs
and cats [10]. The study was conducted and documented
in accordance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion–Center for Veterinary Medicine (FDA-CVM) Guid-
ance for Industry 85, International Co-operation on
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registra-
tion of Veterinary Products (VICH) GL9, Good Clinical
Practice (May 2001) [11].
Animals and households
Households enrolled in the study were required to have
at least one and no more than three cats. All household
cats were to be at least 8 weeks of age, weigh at least 2
pounds and be clinically in good health or have minor ail-
ments that would not be expected to interfere with the
study. Cats with pre-existing chronic diseases (i.e. dia-
betes, hyperthyroidism, osteoarthritis) were eligible for
inclusion if these conditions were considered to be stable
or controlled. At least one cat in each qualifying house-
hold was required to have a minimum of five fleas.

Households with the following situations were
excluded from enrollment: if they contained cats that
were intended for breeding or were pregnant or lactat-
ing; if there had been any environmental flea treatment
within 30 days prior to study participation; or if they
contained cats treated with products likely to interfere
with the conduct or interpretation of study results (e.g. 
treatment with another ectoparasiticide preparation).
Minimum withdrawal times which could interfere with
study results were established for ectoparasiticide treat-
ments, and these corresponded to the efficacy dura-
tion given on the product label. If the product used was
not clearly identified, a minimum withdrawal time of 4
weeks was followed. A minimum withdrawal time of 2
weeks prior to study participation was applied for use
of an ectoparasiticide collar. Bathing/shampooing of
study cats was not permitted within 48 h prior to the
start of the study treatment in order to avoid confound-
ing factors which could potentially impact the day 0 flea
counts.
Other than for that one pretreatment restriction, or
use of any product active against fleas and/or ticks, there
were no restrictions on wetting or bathing and no restric-
tions on the presence of non-feline household pets. Cats
were permitted to be kept indoors or outdoors. Dogs in
study households were required to receive treatment for
the duration of the study with a monthly flea adulticide
product that was commercially available and dispensed
by the clinic at the time of study initiation.
The primary cat in each household was the experimen-
tal unit. The primary cat was chosen by random drawing
if more than one cat in the household met all inclusion
criteria, including a minumum of five fleas. All house-
hold cats dosed with the study treatment were included
in the safety analyses. Participating study cats were fed, 
housed and managed by their owners, and pet owners
were requested to maintain study cats on the same diet
throughout the study. Cat owners administered study
treatments. Participating veterinary clinics followed
standard veterinary procedures.
Permitted reasons for study withdrawal included: dis-
cretion of the investigator, owner withdrawal of con-
sent or an adverse event requiring cessation of study
treatment or observations. Other withdrawal reasons
included: use of a protocol-restricted concomitant treat-
ment, lack of study treatment efficacy, loss to follow-up
and protocol deviations which may have compromised
study integrity.
Enrollment
Each clinic performed a thorough physical examination, 
including body weight, of all study cats and determined 
a body condition score. An assessment of FAD signs was
performed for any cat with at least one flea. Blood sam-
ples were collected from cats for serum chemistry and
hematology testing to serve as a baseline assessment of
health. All cats were combed for flea and tick counts. 
The household was enrolled in the study once all cats
were determined to be eligible, and at least one cat had
a minimum of five fleas. Within each clinic, primary cats
were then blocked into threes on order of household
enrollment. Primary cats were then randomly allocated
to a treatment group using a 2:1 ratio of lotilaner (Cre-
delio™ CAT; Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN, USA) 
to fipronil + S-methoprene (Frontline® Plus; Boehringer
Ingelheim Animal Health USA Inc., Duluth, GA, USA).
Other household cats were designated as supplementary
cats and received the same treatment as the household
primary cat. Flea and tick counts were not performed at
subsequent visits for supplementary cats. FAD assess-
ments were performed at subsequent visits on all cats
(both primary and supplementary) if their enrollment
visit flea count was at least one flea and if FAD signs
were present at enrollment. The target enrollment was
100 primary cats in the lotilaner treatment group and 50
primary cats in the fipronil + S-methoprene treatment
group.
Treatments
Treatments dispensed to owners for administration at
home were: (i) Lotilaner (Credelio™ CAT) available to
each clinic for dispensing in two tablet strengths, namely
12 and 48 mg lotilaner, to be administered on the basis of
each cat’s body weight at the proposed label dose of 6–25
mg/kg; (ii) fipronil + S-methoprene (Frontline® Plus),
available to each clinic for dispensing as individual dose
applicators for topical administration (fipronil 9.8% and
S-methoprene 11.8% per 0.5-ml applicator), to be admin-
istered per label.
Examining veterinarians who conducted flea/tick
counts, physical examinations and FAD assessments
and determined body condition scores were blinded
to treatment asignments. Designated study person-
nel at each site dispensed study treatments to owners
and were responsible for treatment group allocation, 
training pet owners on study treatment administra-
tion and drug accountability. Treatment records were
maintained separately from those of the examining vet-
erinarian’s records, and designated treatment person-
nel did not disclose treatment-related information to
the examining veterinarian (and/or trained designees).
At each visit, the designated treatment personnel dis-
pensed the appropriate treatment for each household
Page 4

cat to the pet owner. Owners were instructed to admin-
ister study treatments once on each of days 0, 30 (±
2) and 60 (± 2) and to feed their cats within approxi-
mately 30 min prior to lotilaner treatment.
For animals on lotilaner treatment, each cat’s owner
was instructed to initially offer the tablet by hand, on
the floor or in an empty bowl. If the cat did not accept
and consume the tablet, the owner was instructed to
offer the tablet in a small amount of food or in a treat. 
If the cat did not voluntarily accept the tablet, the owner
was instructed to administer the tablet directly into the
cat’s mouth, towards the back of the tongue, and then to
encourage the cat to swallow the tablet. If the cat vomited
the tablet within 30 min of administration, the owner was
instructed to contact the treatment dispenser at the clinic
in order to obtain a replacement.
Concomitant treatments were permitted, provided
they were not expected to interfere with study objectives. 
Some concomitant treatments, such as corticosteroids, 
antihistamines and antibiotics administered for FAD
signs, required exclusion of the FAD assessment data. 
Products such as vaccinations, heartworm preventives, 
intestinal parasiticides, or nutritional supplements were
considered acceptable.
Flea counting and assessment of flea allergy dermatitis
Each primary cat in the household was subjected to flea
comb counts on study days 0, 30, 60 and 90. Flea comb
counts were performed on day 0 only for all supplemen-
tary cats. To perform the counts, study personnel used an
extra fine-toothed flea comb and combed the entire body
of each cat for a minimum of 10 min. At the initial visit, 
study personnel stopped counting if fewer than five fleas
were counted within the initial 5 min of combing. Heavy
infestations consisting of > 250 fleas were recorded as >
250. For these cats, the value of 251 was used for analysis. 
All fleas removed during the comb count procedure were
disposed of and were not returned to any cats.
On day 0, the examining veterinarian performed an
FAD assessment for each study cat with a flea count of
at least one. Subsequent FAD assessments were per-
formed on days 30, 60 and 90 for any cats demonstrating
FAD signs on day 0. Each sign of FAD (pruritus, papules, 
erythema, alopecia, scaling, dermatitis/pyodermatitis) 
was assessed and classified as absent, mild, moderate
or severe, corresponding to a scoring of 0 (absent) to 3
(severe).  Wherever possible, the same examining vet-
erinarian performed each follow-up FAD assessment for
each cat. FAD assessments were not performed on days
30, 60 and 90 for any cats with no fleas on day 0, but any
subsequent appearance of FAD signs was recorded as an
adverse event. 
Assessments and statistics
The efficacy of each treatment in the control of flea infes-
tation was assessed by comparing baseline flea counts
on day 0 (enrollment visit) with those at 30, 60 and 90
days later. Efficacy was determined via the percentage
reduction in live adult flea counts from pre- to post-dos-
ing within each treatment group. The calculation used
for percentage efficacy at each counting time was: per-
centage efficacy = ([MB–MA]/MB) × 100, where MB
is the mean flea count prior to dosing (day 0) and MA
is the mean flea count post-dosing (days 30, 60 and 90, 
respectively).
Geometric means were used in the calculations for
efficacy determination, and calculations were also per-
formed using arithmetic means. Calculation of geometric
means involved taking the logarithm of the flea count of
each cat. For any flea counts equal to zero, 1 was added
to the count for every animal in the group and then
subtracted from the resultant mean prior to calculating
percentage efficacy. For each treatment group, the log-
transformed flea (count + 1) data were analyzed from
pre- to post-dosing with analysis of variance (ANOVA) to
determine if a statistically significant flea count reduction
from baseline occurred at each time point. The model
included a fixed effect, Paired, which was defined as an
indicator variable (0, 1; to represent pre- and post-dosing
counts), and the random effect of Site. Separate models
were fitted for each of days 30, 60 and 90 compared to
day 0.
A study treatment was considered to be efficacious at
any time point if the following criteria were met: (i) cats
were adequately infested with fleas prior to first dosing
(≥ 5 fleas); (ii) the calculated efficacy at the time point
was ≥ 90%, based on geometric means; (iii) there was a
statistically significant decrease at a two-sided 0.05 level
of significance (P < 0.05) in pre- to post-dosing flea counts
at the time point.
Flea counts were compared between the treatment
groups, separately for each of days 30, 60 and 90, using
ANOVA. Likewise, the number of cats free of fleas was
compared using Fisher’s exact test.
As a secondary efficacy variable, total FAD score (for
all cats receiving post-enrollment FAD assessments) was
calculated at each time point as the sum of the clinical
sign scores (pruritus, erythema, scaling, papules, alope-
cia, dermatitis/pyodermatitis scores) and evaluated over
time by an ANOVA. Differences between treatment
groups for each of days 30, 60 and 90 were determined, as
well as within a treatment group over time. An additional
secondary endpoint was the acceptance of the lotilaner
tablets. Tablet acceptance was assessed by the cat owner
at each of the dosing episodes on days 0, 30, and 60.

Safety was assessed through the evaluation of adverse
events reported by the pet owner and the evaluating vet-
erinarian. Body weight was statistically evaluated over
time and within each treatment group. Clinical pathology
parameters (hematology and clinical chemistry variables) 
were evaluated descriptively relative to normal ranges
provided by the laboratory and in the context of pre- and
post-dosing values.
All statistical analyses were performed using the SAS®
software package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
From June to November 2015, 139 primary cats were
enrolled in the lotilaner group (230 cats in total, includ-
ing supplementary household cats) and 69 primary cats
were enrolled in the fipronil + S-methoprene group
(113 cats in total) at 11 veterinary clinics across the USA
(2 clinics in each of Florida and Missouri, and 1 clinic
in each of Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Michigan, 
Oregon, South Carolina and Texas). The safety popula-
tion was defined as enrolled cats which received at least
one dose of the study treatment and included 228 cats in 
the lotilaner group (dosing could not be confirmed for 2
enrolled cats, and these were excluded from the safety
population) and 113 cats in the fipronil + S-methoprene
groups. The mean age of cats in the safety population of
both groups was approximately 5 years (range 1.9 months
to 20 years) (Table 1). There was a similar distribution
of age groupings per treatment group, and over 75% of
cats in each group were older than 12 months. The mini-
mum ages were 1.9 months in the lotilaner group and
2.3 months in the fipronil + S-methoprene group, and
minimum weights were 0.9 and 1.1 kg, respectively. The
sex and neuter status of enrolled cats was similar in both
groups, as was the distribution of single and multiple cat
households. Domestic short-haired cats were the most
common breed enrolled (81.1% of cats in the lotilaner
group and 77.0% of cats in the fipronil + S-methoprene
group). Domestic long-haired cats represented 8.8 and
13.3% of the lotilaner group and fipronil + S-methoprene
group, respectively. Other breeds enrolled in the study, 
but represented at lower frequencies, were Siamese, Per-
sian, Himalayan, Bengal, Sphinx, Ragdoll, Russian Blue
and Egyptian Mau.

For assessments of efficacy, data were used from 126
and 62 primary cats treated with lotilaner and fipronil
+ S-methoprene, respectively. Reasons for exclusion
of cats and data in the efficacy analyses included loss of
follow-up, cat not fed prior to lotilaner dose, forbidden
concomitant medication, occurrence of an adverse event
that required stopping the observations, withdrawal
of owner’s consent and death (2 primary cats died, dis-
cussed below).
Both groups showed statistically significant (P < 0.0001; 
Table 2; Fig. 2) reductions in mean flea counts from base-
line (pre-treatment, day 0 visit) at every post-treatment
assessment up to the end of the study. At day 90, 98.3% 
of lotilaner-treated cats and 28.8% of fipronil + S-metho-
prene-treated cats were free of fleas (Table 3; Fig. 1). This
difference in proportions of cats free of fleas between
the two treatment groups was statistically significant
(P < 0.0001, Χ12 = 63.8) (Table 3; Fig. 1). The statistical
comparison of the treatment groups also showed that
there were significantly fewer fleas on cats in the lotilaner

were not statistically different (t(8)

laner group was 98.3% on day 30 and 99.9% on days 60
and 90; for the fipronil + S-methoprene group, efficacyt
was < 90% for all post-treatment time points (Table 2; 
Fig. 2).
Tablet acceptability, as administered by pet owners, 
was documented for all lotilaner-treated cats. Lotilaner
tablets were voluntarily accepted by 46.9% of cats when
offered by hand, in an empty food bowl or with food. 
The tablets were administered directly into the mouth
for 52.6% of cats. In the study, 99.5% of tablets were suc-
cessfully administered (Table 5). No cats were observed
to have vomited within 30 min of treatment. Redosing
was reported once each for two cats in the study (Table 5) 
due to pet owner difficulty in dosing. These cats were
then successfully dosed with the assistance of study site
personnel.
There were 58 cats in the lotilaner group and 27 cats
in the fipronil + S-methoprene group which had FAD
clinical signs monitored and were eligible for analysis
throughout the study (i.e. FAD population). The arith-
metic mean total FAD scores at baseline were 4.2 in the
lotilaner group and 4.4 in the fipronil + S-methoprene
group. Analysis of the FAD total score indicated that the
total score was reduced significantly following treatment
in both groups by day 30 (lotilaner group: P < 0.0001; 
fipronil + S-methoprene group: P = 0.0041) and contin-
ued to decrease following multiple treatments, falling to
1.0, 0.3, 0.1 on days 30, 60 and 90 (lotilaner group) and
to 3.0, 2.5, 2.0 (fipronil + S-methoprene group), respec-
tively. This reduction was statistically significant for both
groups on all days. The FAD total score was also signifi-
cantly lower in the lotilaner group than in the fipronil +
S-methoprene group on day 90 (t(7)
 = 5.83, P = 0.0006).
FAD scores for pruritus were significantly lower in the
lotilaner group than in the fipronil + S-methoprene
group on all post-treatment days (P = 0.0420 for day 30; P
= 0.0397 for day 60; P = 0.0033 for day 90).
Adverse reactions that occurred at an incidence of ≥
1% are presented in Table 6. Weight loss was reported
with similar frequency in both groups (lotinaner group: 
2.2%; fipronil + S-methoprene group: 1.8%). Tachypnea
was reported in three cats (1.3%) from the same house-
hold in the lotilaner group. This adverse reaction for all
three cats was observed on day 0 and was not observed
after dosing on days 30 or 60. Vomiting was reported
in 1.3% of the lotilaner group and 0.9% of the fipronil +
S-methoprene group.

Two cats died during the study, one from each group. 
The cause of death for each cat was motor vehicle trauma
and was not considered to be an adverse reaction to the
study treatment. Two cats, one from each group, were
removed from the study prematurely due to adverse
events. The cat in the lotilaner group was removed from
the study and diagnosed with disseminated lymphosar-
coma. The cat in the fipronil + S-methoprene group suf-
fered a broken jaw due to motor vehicle trauma and was
removed from the study. Both of these events were not
attributed to treatment.
Analyses of of hematology and clinical chemistry iden-
tified individual and isolated departures from normal
reference ranges, but did not reflect patterns of clinical
significance in terms of safety of the study treatments.
A range of concomitant medications were administered
to study cats, including some not allowed by the protocol, 
ranging from antibacterial medications, anti-inflamma-
tory medications (including corticosteroid-containing
products),  endoparasiticide medications, sedatives and
vaccines. Data from cats receiving concomitant medica-
tions for treatment of FAD signs were excluded from the
FAD analyses. No other ectoparasiticide products (other
than study treatments) were used during the study. All
concomitant treatments were well tolerated. 
Discussion
The diverse group of cats enrolled in the lotilaner group
and their broad geographic spread across the different
regions of the USA provide a good representation of the
real-world conditions regarding the use of an antipara-
sitic product. The study spanned the seasons of sum-
mer, fall and early winter in the temperate climate of
the USA and, therefore, study households and cats were
exposed to seasonal factors (such as warm temperatures
and humidity) which are hospitable to flea infestations
and increase the potential for the development of signs
of FAD [2]. The results of this study align with results of
laboratory studies demonstrating lotilaner to be a safe
and efficacious flea control treatment for cats [7–9]. Loti-
laner was shown to be highly efficacious from the first
treatment onward. Efficacy, based on geometric mean
flea counts, for the lotilaner group was 98.3% on day 30
and 99.9% on days 60 and 90, compared to 61.6, 75.4, and
84.7% for the fipronil + S-methoprene group, respec-
tively, and the percentage of flea free cats by day 90 was
98.3% for the lotilaner group and 28.8% for the fipronil
+ S-methoprene group (Table 3; Fig. 1). With respect to
flea counts, the number of cats free from fleas and total
FAD score, lotilaner was shown to be superior to fipronil
+ S-methoprene.
The FAD signs scoring system used in this study (scor-
ing lesions as mild, moderate and severe) is consistent
with that described for other field studies assessing the
efficacy of isoxazoline flea control products [12–14].
Limitations of this scoring methodology include that it
has not been validated and it is subjective, whereby grad-
ing may vary between clinicians. Nonetheless, as in other
reported studies, the progressive and marked improve-
ment in each clinical sign of FAD in treated cats can be
attributed to two factors that are related to lotilaner’s
rapid onset and sustained residual flea speed of kill [8, 
9]. The first is the reduction of antigenic challenge via 
the rapid kill of newly infesting fleas. The second factor
is due to the killing of newly infesting fleas on the cat
before egg-laying can begin, which promotes progres-
sive depletion of household flea biomass and subsequent
elimination.

topical fluralaner-treated cats and 98 cats treated with a
monthly topical fipronil + S-methoprene formulation. 
At 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-administration, the efficacy
of fluralaner was > 99%, and the percentage of flea-free
cats was 80.7, 88.7 and 80.0%, respectively [13]. A study
in the USA on a topical isoxazoline combination formu-
lation (selamectin + sarolaner) compared the results of
171 cats treated with selamectin + sarolaner and 82
cats treated with a topical imidacloprid + moxidectin
formulation for three consecutive monthly doses. Effi-
cacy of the selamectin + sarolaner formulation was >
97% at 30, 60 and 90 days post-treatment initiation [14].
Overall, these findings indicate that the performance of
orally administered lotilaner, under field conditions, is
consistent with the performance reported for topical
isoxazoline formulations.

14 and 28, compared to 48.3 and 46.4% for a topical
fipronil + S-methoprene monthly product [12]. While
Credelio™ CAT (lotilaner flavored chewable tablet) is
the first orally administered isoxazoline product for
cats in the USA, two feline topical isoxazolines have
been approved by the FDA [13, 14].  A study in the

An important attribute of a product to control fleas
in cats is the ease of administration of the product
for the cat owner. Overall, 46.9% of the tablets were
accepted voluntarily (e.g. offered from the hand, floor, 
empty food bowl or with the addition of food). Com-
bining voluntary acceptance with doses which were
delivered to cats by being placed in the mouth (52.6%)
gave an overall tablet acceptance of 99.5% when admin-
istered by the cat owners. Only 0.5% of the doses could
not be administered by pet owners, but these cats were

Conclusion
The results of this study, utizing client-owned cats
across the USA, demonstrate the safety and efficacy
of lotilaner tablets under a wide range of real-world
conditions. Lotilaner flavored chewable tablets were
easily administered by owners and widely accepted by
cats. A single lotilaner treatment, administered by the
pet owner, was 98.3% efficacious in reducing mean
flea counts within 30 days, the time of the first post-
treatment assessment. Three consecutive monthly loti-
laner treatments resulted in a >99.9% reduction in flea
infestations. In comparison, treatment with fipronil +
S-methoprene was < 90% efficacious throughout the
study. Treatment with lotilaner resulted in a marked
reduction in, or elimination of, signs of flea allergy
dermatitis throughout the 3-month study. Lotilaner
was more efficacious for the treatment and control of
flea infestations than fipronil + S-methoprene and
was associated with greater reduction in signs of FAD. 
Adverse reactions were mild and infrequent, confirm-
ing the safety of lotilaner in client-owned cats. The
study therefore demonstrates that lotilaner flavored
chewable tablets (Credelio™ CAT) are widely accepted
and easy to administer, and that the safety and efficacy
of lotilaner are maintained regardless of geography and
season.
