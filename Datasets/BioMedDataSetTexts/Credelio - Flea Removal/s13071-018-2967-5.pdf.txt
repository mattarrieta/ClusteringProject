Abstract
Background: There is a continuing need for novel approaches to tick infestations treatment and control in cats.
Lotilaner, an isoxazoline with rapid onset of action, has proven its efficacy against ticks in laboratory studies. A study
was undertaken to confirm lotilaner’s efficacy and safety in client-owned cats, at the minimum dose of 6.0 mg/kg,
against the most common ticks infesting cats in Europe.
Methods: Twenty clinics in Germany, Hungary and Portugal participated in the study. Households with no more
than three cats were randomized 2:1 to a lotilaner or fipronil group. The first household cat with at least three live,
attached ticks was the primary cat. Treatments were dispensed on days 0, 28 and 56 for owner administration. Tick
counts were performed on days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 84 (primary cats) and supplementary cats were
assessed for safety only, on days 28, 56 and 84. Efficacy was assessed by comparing mean day 0 live attached tick
counts with subsequent counts.
Results: Most frequently retrieved ticks were Ixodes ricinus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Dermacentor reticulatus,
with Ixodes hexagonus also present. In the lotilaner group (n = 112) efficacy (based on geometric mean tick counts)
was between 98.3–100%. For fipronil (n = 57), efficacy was between 89.6–99.6%, with live attached ticks present on
some cats at all time points. Mean tick counts in lotilaner-treated cats were significantly lower than in fipronil-treated
cats on days 21, 28, 42 and 56 (P < 0.05). The mean percent efficacy over all post-enrolment visits was 99.6% and 96.4%
(lotilaner and fipronil group, respectively), (P < 0.0001). Lotilaner was superior to fipronil for efficacy averaged over all
time points (P < 0.0001) and on individual assessment days (day 14 to 70, P < 0.0394); it was non-inferior to fipronil on
the other days. Owners successfully administered all treatments, and both products were well tolerated.
Conclusions: CredelioTM was effective and safe for the treatment of tick infestations in client-owned cats.
Efficacy lasted one month and lotilaner was superior to fipronil on most assessment days. Cure rates ranged
between 94.5–100% for lotilaner and 68.4–98.2% for fipronil.

Background
Favourable epidemiological conditions due to climate
change and changing human behaviours leading to
increased risk of tick exposure for humans and pets,
have been linked to a widening geographical spread and
increasing abundance of the ixodid ticks, Ixodes ricinus,
Dermacentor reticulatus and Rhipicephalus sanguineus
[1–4].  This increases the risk for vector-borne diseases
such as tick-borne encephalitis, babesiosis, anaplasmosis
and ehrlichiosis.
Topical tick control products have been the mainstay
of treatment. However, there are now reports of resist-
ance or tolerance to common topically applied acaricides
[5]. This highlights the need for novel approaches to the
treatment of tick infestations in pets. The emergence of
the isoxazolines has begun to address that need. Acting
with a unique mode of action, these molecules have
been shown to be effective in treating ectoparasitic infes-
tations on dogs [6–8].
Amongst the available isoxazolines, afoxolaner, flu-
ralaner, sarolaner and lotilaner are approved as oral
formulations for the control of tick and flea infesta-
tions in dogs. Lotilaner (Credelio™,  Elanco) is the
newest member of this class and is already available
as a flavoured chewable tablet formulation for dogs
[9].  Laboratory studies in dogs demonstrated that
lotilaner quickly begins killing induced infestations
with I. ricinus,  and has sustained activity against new
infestations with Ixodes scapularis,  I. ricinus,  Derma-
centor variabilis,  D. reticulatus and Rhipicephalus
sanguineus for at least 35 days [10, 11].
The only isoxazolines approved for use in cats are flur-
alaner (Bravecto®;  Merck Animal Health, Madison, NJ,
USA) [12] and sarolaner (Stronghold Plus®,  Zoetis SA,
Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium) [13],  both as solutions for
topical application. A flavoured oral formulation would
fulfil the need for a rapidly effective, orally administered
ectoparasiticide with sustained activity for the control of
ticks and fleas in cats and kittens.
The safety and efficacy of lotilaner tablets against ticks
and fleas in cats were assessed in a number of pilot
(unpublished data) and pivotal [14] studies. A pivotal to-
lerance study in 8-week-old kittens has shown lotilaner to
be safe at doses up to 130 mg lotilaner/kg (five times the
maximum therapeutic dose, with a dose banding of four)
for monthly administration over 8 months. Efficacy of the
final formulation was demonstrated following oral adminis-
tration at a minimum dose rate of 6.0 mg/kg against fleas
(Ctenocephalides felis) and I. ricinus for 1 month in pivotal
field and laboratory studies [15–17].
In this randomised, assessor-blinded, multicentre trial,
the authors evaluated the efficacy, safety, and palatability
of lotilaner (CredelioTM chewable tablets for cats)
administered at a minimum dose rate of 6.0 mg/kg to 
client-owned cats naturally infested with ticks, under
field conditions in Europe. Eliminall® Spot-on (fipronil
50 mg, KRKA d.d. Novo mesto, Novo Mesto Slovenia)
was used as the comparator.
Methods
This randomized, assessor-blinded, positive-controlled,
multicentre field trial was conducted in compliance with
VICH GL9 (Good Clinical Practice, June 2000) guidelines
and Directive 2001/82/EC as amended, applicable
European and local and national regulatory requirements
(German Drug Law, Hungarian Regulation 128/2009
(X.6.) FVM, Portuguese law N° 148/2008 amended by
413/2009), European Union guidelines for demonstration
of efficacy of ectoparasiticides [18] and palatability [19], of
veterinary medicinal products; in addition, other appli-
cable guidelines [20, 21].
Animals
This trial was conducted between March 2015 and
August 2015 at 20 veterinary practices in Germany,
Hungary and Portugal, in areas with known high
prevalence of ticks. Privately owned animals from
households with a maximum of three cats and two
dogs, were eligible for participation in the trial,
provided that the animals did not contact each other
or share resting places for the duration of the study.
The animal owner was required to provide written
consent for his/her animals to be eligible to partici-
pate in the trial.
Cats at a minimum age of 2 months, weighing at least
1 kg and classified as clinically healthy and free of any
systemic diseases or conditions judged not to interfere
with suitability for treatment administration were con-
sidered eligible. One cat from each household (primary
cat) had to be diagnosed with a tick infestation of at
least three live, attached ticks for inclusion in the trial.
Any supplementary cats had to fulfil the same eligibility
criteria as the primary cats with the exception of tick in-
festation, i.e. they were included without prior tick count
and also in the absence of tick infestation. These animals
were not involved in any efficacy assessments and were
only monitored for safety and palatability assessments
(supplementary cats).
Animals with known hypersensitivity to the active
ingredients and/or excipients of the investigational vete-
rinary product (IVP; CredelioTM tablets for cats, active
ingredient lotilaner; Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield,
USA) or the control product (CP; Eliminall® 50 mg
Spot-on solution for cats, active ingredient fipronil;
KRKA d.d. Novo mesto, Novo Mesto, Slovenia) were not
eligible for the trial. The use of ectoparasiticides with a
removal period less than the duration of efficacy
mentioned on the label, collars with a withdrawal period
Page 3
Cavalleri et al. Parasites & Vectors (2018) 11:411  Page 3 of 10
of less than 2 weeks, endoparasiticides active against ec-
toparasites or any products potentially interfering with
the trial objectives, was a criterion for exclusion from
trial participation. Other criteria for exclusion were
pregnant or lactating cats, any animal intended for
breeding within 4 months after the last treatment ad-
ministration, pre-existing medical or surgical conditions
that could interfere with the objectives of the study, con-
valescent animals, and animals scheduled for routine
surgical procedures unless they were fully recovered
from the procedure. After inclusion in the study, animals
could be removed because of a concomitant disease not
allowing the animal to stay on the trial or requiring the
use of treatments interfering with the trial objectives,
death, euthanasia or serious adverse events (AEs).
Animals could also be withdrawn prematurely because
of protocol non-compliance, use of a non-approved
concomitant therapy or owner’s decision.
The animals remained with their owners under their
usual housing conditions throughout the trial. Space
allocation, thermoregulation, ventilation, and relative
humidity were according to the owner’s usual habits or
veterinary practices/clinics in case of admission; these
parameters were not recorded. Feed and water were ac-
cording to the owner’s usual habits or according to the
veterinary practices/clinics in case of admission.
Bathing/immersion in water was to be avoided because
of the use of a spot-on treatment as CP.
Except for the IVP or CP administered according to
the protocol, the use of any product with efficacy against
ticks on the animal or environment between day 0 and
the last tick count on day 84 ± 2 was not allowed. Con-
comitant treatments not interfering with the objectives
of the study were allowed. All concomitant treatments
were recorded.
Randomisation and treatment
There were two separate teams (the examining veterinar-
ian’s and the dispenser’s team) at each study site performing
the different tasks within the study. The examining veteri-
narian and laboratory personnel were blinded to the treat-
ment allocation. The sponsor’s representative as well as
other study personnel and animal owners were not blinded,
but were trained not to provide any treatment information
to any blinded study personnel during the study.
Using a block design in a 2:1 ratio (IVP:CP), the primary
cats were randomised per household in the sequence of
inclusion; all cats (primary and supplementary) in the
same household were randomised to the same treatment.
Study design, randomisation, definition of inclusion and
exclusion criteria, definition of assessment criteria, and
description of evaluation criteria and statistical analyses
were measures aimed at reducing any bias and provide
solid data for analysis. 
Treatments (IVP or CP) were administered every 4
weeks on days 0, 28 ± 2 and 56 ± 2. Based on the indi-
vidual animal’s body weight, animals in Group 1 received
the IVP (CredelioTM chewable tablets for cats) at a
minimum dose rate of 6.0 mg/kg, orally. Two tablets
strengths were available, i.e. 12 mg or 48 mg lotilaner.
These two tablets were specifically developed and for-
mulated for cats, with a  small tablet size and
vanilla-yeast flavouring to aid in administration. The IVP
was administered to the cat by the owner under fed con-
ditions, i.e. approximately one-third of the daily ration of
regular feed, taken less than 30 min before treatment.
Animals in Group 2 were treated with the CP
(Eliminall® 50 mg Spot-on solution): 1 pipette (0.5 ml)
topically regardless of body weight, according to the
product label. Dogs in the same households (up to
two per household) were treated on day 0 or latest
on day 1, with an adequate commercial ectoparasiti-
cide provided by the veterinary practice. These dogs
had to be under treatment until the end of the study
(day 84 ± 2).
Assessments and analyses
The total duration of the study was between 82 and 86
days per animal except for those prematurely removed
from the study. On day 0, all animals were assessed to
confirm that they met the eligibility criteria, animal
demographics and history were recorded, and cats were
allocated to the relevant study group. On days 0, 7 ± 1,
14 ± 2, 21 ± 2, 28 ± 2, 42 ± 2, 56 ± 2, 70 ± 2 and 84 ± 2,
the examining veterinarian assessed the primary cats for
tick infestation (tick counts), interviewed the owners for
any abnormal observation, measured the bodyweight
and performed clinical examination (primary and sup-
plementary cats). On day 84 ± 2, all cats were presented
for study completion. Cats that were removed from the
study early, underwent the same procedure as planned
for the study end visit on day 84 ± 2, if possible, and the
reason for the animal’s early removal was recorded. The
cat owners assessed palatability for all Group 1 cats on
days 0, 28 ± 2 and 56 ± 2.
Baseline characteristics
Using descriptive statistics, treatment groups were com-
pared for the following baseline parameters: animal
characteristics (breed, sex, age, coat length and body
weight),  animal husbandry. For primary cats, parasite
counts on day 0 (live attached ticks and tick species)
were also compared. Nominal P-values were calculated.
Tick counts
The examining veterinarian performed a tick count on
each primary cat. The cat was restrained and the entire
coat searched, beginning at the head and proceeding
Page 4

systematically to cover all areas of the animal. The hair
was pushed manually against its natural lie to expose the
skin and attached ticks. If ticks were observed, they were
counted, removed, collected, and sent to a laboratory for
identification. Before proceeding with the tick removal,
the tick viability was assessed. Both live attached and
dead attached ticks were counted and collected separ-
ately. The examining veterinarian recorded the number
of live attached and dead attached ticks.
Environmental tick pressure
The environmental tick pressure was assessed and docu-
mented as the estimated overall number of animals (cats
and dogs) presented at the veterinary practice or clinic,
diagnosed with a tick infestation and the number of
products supplied for tick prophylaxis in the last 7 days
before study enrolment and in the last 7 days before
every scheduled follow-up visit of a primary cat.
Palatability
Palatability assessment was based on the voluntary ac-
ceptance rate defined as the percentage of dosings in
which the animals accepted the IVP when offered in an
empty bowl or on the ground during 60 s, or when sub-
sequently offered from the hand for an additional 60 s. 
where M0 is the mean tick count on day 0 and MD is
the mean tick count on actual day; efficacy was based on
live attached ticks.
Tick counts of the IVP treated group were compared
to those of the CP group for non-inferiority, with a 20%
margin, for each time point during the study and aver-
aged over the whole study period. Non-inferiority was
shown if the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for
the ratio of tick counts for live attached ticks for the
IVP, divided by the same value for the CP, lay within the
interval [0, 1/0.80] or [0, 1.25].
All study animals receiving at least one dose of the in-
vestigational veterinary or control product were included
in the Safety population. This population matched the
ITT population. Animals without any major protocol de-
viation were included in the PP population.
The percentage of adverse events and serious adverse
events were compared between the two treatment
groups using Fisher’s exact test. Body weight at the vari-
ous time points were compared between the two treat-
ment groups by ANCOVA with the pre-treatment value
as the covariate.

Endpoints and analysis methods
The primary study endpoint was the average efficacy of
the IVP compared to the CP over the entire treatment
period compared to baseline, based on counts of live,
attached ticks in primary cats. The secondary efficacy
criterion was the efficacy of the IVP compared to the CP
for each treatment period compared to baseline, again
based on live, attached tick counts in primary cats. The
experimental unit was the individual animal.
Data from all study animals were entered directly into
StudyBase®, a validated CRO-owned Electronic data cap-
ture (EDC) system (version 1.7.8.0). All calculations were
performed using SAS® statistical analysis software v9.2.2
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Tick counts were log-transformed prior to analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA). To avoid taking the log of zero,
1 was added to all tick counts before log-transforming.
All statistical differences were assessed at the 2-sided 5%
significance level (P < 0.05) corresponding to a 1-sided
significance level of 2.5%).
The primary analysis of efficacy was based on primary
cats in the Per-Protocol (PP) population, but the results
were virtually identical for the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) and
the PP analysis. Percent efficacy was calculated for the
average of all visits and for each visit (days 7 ± 1; 14 ± 2;
21 ± 2; 28 ± 2; 42 ± 2; 56 ± 2; 70 ± 2; and 84 ± 2) as
follows:
Percent efficacy = 100 (M0 - MD)/M0 
Results
Animals
A total of 309 cats were randomized in the study: 169
primary cats and 140 supplementary cats. There were
112 and 57 primary cats enrolled in the IVP and CP
group, respectively, comprising the ITT population.
None of the enrolled primary cats were completely ex-
cluded from the PP analysis. Four animals were excluded
from the statistical analysis of specific study days; four
animals had missing visits and three animals of the effi-
cacy population did not complete the study meeting the
criteria for premature removal. Of the 169 primary cats,
47% (n = 79), 24% (n = 40) and 30% (n = 50) were from
households with a single cat, 1 supplementary cat and 2
supplementary cats, respectively.
Treatment groups were homogenous for demographic and
characteristics at baseline: sex (P = 0.6266), age (P = 0.7704),
body weight (P = 0.5854),  breed (P = 0.9562),  hair
length (P = 0.7208),  husbandry (P = 1.0000),  time
spent indoors/outdoors (P = 0.1697) and tick counts
(P = 0.9411) (Table 1).
Following enrolment, 7 cats (3 in the IVP group and 4
in the CP group) were removed from the study because
of the following reasons: death (3; 2 cats were killed in
car accidents and 1 cat died because of respiratory
failure secondary to acute-subacute aspiration pneumo-
nia and pleural effusion),  pregnancy (1),  owner’s
non-compliance (2) and loss to follow-up (1).

Efficacy
At each administration day, all study animals received the
correct amount of IVP or CP as defined in the protocol.
The efficacy analysis population (both PP and ITT) in-
cluded 169 primary cats with 112 and 57 cats in the IVP
and CP groups, respectively. Because no cats were com-
pletely excluded from the PP analysis and 4 cats were only
partially excluded (2 each in the IVP and CP groups), the
results of the efficacy analysis for the ITT and PP popula-
tions are almost identical. Results are presented here for
the PP population. The geometric mean tick count at 
baseline was 3.60 and 3.52 in the IVP and CP groups,
respectively.
It was demonstrated (with a 97.5% confidence limit)
that tick counts in the IVP group were not higher than
those in the CP group, up to a non-inferiority margin of
20% over all visits. Superiority of lotilaner compared to
fipronil was demonstrated on the majority of study days
[day 14 to day 70, when cats treated with lotilaner had
significantly lower tick counts (P < 0.0394)], as well as
for efficacy averaged over all time points (P < 0.0001)
(Table 2).

Cure rate was defined as percentage of cats with zero
live attached ticks. Cure rates in the IVP group were
100%, 100%, 100%, 94.5%, 100%, 95.5%, 99.1% and 100%
on days 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 84, respectively. The
corresponding cure rates in the CP group were 98.2%,
96.5%,  93%,  68.4%,  82.5%,  80.4%,  89.3% and 98.2%,  re-
spectively (Fig. 1).
The baseline data for tick species and numbers are
provided in Table 3. The study period covered the nor-
mal period of activity for the tick species Ixodes ricinus,
Rhipicephalus sanguineus,  Dermacentor reticulatus and
Ixodes hexagonus, and persistent challenge was demon-
strated. The overall mean percentage efficacy, as well as
the efficacy against the various identified tick species in
this study for the IVP and CP treated groups over the
treatment period compared with baseline, are shown in
Table 4 and Table 5.
Palatability
Palatability was assessed for all primary and supplemen-
tary cats in the IVP group. Administration compliance
in the lotilaner group was 100%,  with all cats success-
fully dosed by their owners and no refusal of tablets re-
corded. The mean voluntary acceptance rate (pooled
data from all 3 monthly treatment days) was 48%.
Safety
The safety population included all primary and supple-
mentary animals. In total, 309 cats were included in the
safety population with 211 and 98 in the IVP and the CP
group, respectively. 
Adverse events
Over the study duration, 18 adverse events [AEs and ser-
ious adverse events (SAEs)] were reported in 7 of the
309 animals with 3 of 211 cats (1.0%) in the IVP group
and 4 out of 98 cats (1.3%) in the CP group showing at
least 1 clinical sign.
With the exception of 2 deaths in the Eliminall®
group (frequency = 2%),  all other AEs were reported
in only one cat each, with a corresponding frequency
of 0.5% in the CredelioTM group and 1% in the Elimi-
nall® group. No vomiting nor diarrhoea were observed
in the study, in any of the treatment groups. Using
Fisher’s exact test, no statistical significant difference
was found between the 2 treatment groups for any of
the reported AEs or SAEs (P = 0.2138 and P =
0.2372, respectively).
Three cats had SAEs during the study, none of which
were attributed to either treatments. Two cats in the CP
group died because of car accidents. One 12-year-old cat
in the IVP group was brought to the clinic on study day
22 due to complaints of the upper respiratory tract and
corneal injury and was administered vitamins, a subcuta-
neous infusion and an oral endoparasiticide containing
milbemycin oxime and praziquantel; a first dose of
meloxicam suspension and of marbocyl tablets were also
given by the examining veterinarian and continued by
the animal owner at home. On day 26, the cat was pre-
sented to the clinic with severe dyspnoea, tachycardia,
cyanosis and dehydration and in spite of all efforts, died
after 40 min because of respiratory failure. Necropsy re-
vealed lung necrosis and pleural effusion and the cat’s
symptoms were attributed to acute-subacute aspiration
pneumonia with consequential respiratory failure and

Environmental tick pressure
The number of animals diagnosed with tick infestation
during the 7 days prior to a study visit ranged between
0–13 cats and 0–18 dogs. The number of individual
products dispensed for tick prophylaxis during the 7
days prior to a study visit ranged between 1–20 cats and
1–74 dogs (Fig. 2).
Discussion
This field study compared the safety and the efficacy of
the lotilaner commercial formulation (CredelioTM)
against ticks when administered orally at the minimum
dose rate of 6 mg/kg, vs a fipronil spot-on (Eliminall®, in
cats. The choice of the three different regions in which
the study was performed ensured the evaluation of the
efficacy of the product in different climatic and geo-
graphical conditions, with a high environmental tick in-
festation pressure.
The comparison between an orally-administered prod-
uct (lotilaner) against a spot-on treatment (fipronil) was
driven by the lack of availability of an oral tick product
for cats. Furthermore, a generic fipronil containing
product was preferred over the more commonly used
Frontline® spot-on for cats, because of its consistent 4
weeks efficacy duration against I. ricinus [22],  as
opposed to the shorter duration claimed by Frontline®,
as short as 2 weeks, depending on the country, [23].
The minimum body weight of the cats for inclusion
(1 kg) was driven by the comparator product. In pilot

and pivotal target animal safety studies (unpublished
data and 22, respectively),  lotilaner was shown to be
safe for cats as light as 0.5 kg, but since Eliminall®
was contraindicated for cats lighter than 1 kg, a
minimum bodyweight of 1 kg at inclusion was se-
lected in order to maintain the blinding and prevent
the introduction of a bias.
Tick counts and analysis of the demographic pa-
rameters and related variables (age, sex, body weight,
breed, hair length, living area: countryside vs urban,
and lifestyle, i.e. time spent primarily indoors vs out-
doors) confirmed that the two treatment groups
were homogeneous at baseline, with no statistically
significant difference in any of the variables.
In the lotilaner group the efficacy vs baseline was
above 98% at all time points and 99.6% averaged over
all time points. In the fipronil group the efficacy was
above 89% at all time points and 96.4% averaged over
all time points. 
Lotilaner was proven to be superior to fipronil on the
majority of study days, i.e. from day 14 to day 70, when
cats treated with lotilaner had significantly lower tick
counts (P < 0.0394), and was non-inferior to the control
product on the other assessment days. Superiority of
lotilaner was shown as well for efficacy averaged over all
time points (P < 0.0001).
Although in the pivotal laboratory studies the efficacy
of lotilaner was only tested against the most common
European cat tick (Ixodes ricinus) [17], the results of this
field study demonstrate that the product is equally effi-
cacious against the other clinically relevant tick species
infesting cats in Europe, i.e. Rhipicephalus sanguineus,
Dermacentor reticulatus and possibly I. hexagonus,  al-
though the low number of these ticks at baseline does
not allow for a firm conclusion on efficacy. The species
specific analysis showed an efficacy of 100% against R.
sanguineus and I. hexagonus at all time points and an
average efficacy of 99.6% against D. reticulatus.
CredelioTM chewable tablets for cats was designed
specifically as a small, vanilla flavoured, chewable tab-
let, to ensure ease of administration and acceptance by
cats; 100% compliance in the lotilaner group confirmed
that the tablets were easy for pet owners to administer
and well accepted by cats. Palatability results showed
that the product had been taken voluntarily by 48%
cats, which is in line with the “pickiness” and well
documented individual eating preferences of cats [24],
as well as their aversion to unfamiliar flavours and
textures [25].
Both treatments were well tolerated, with 0.014% lotilaner
cats and 0.4% cats treated with fipronil affected by adverse
events. The difference was not statistically significant. In
addition, no significant differences between the two groups
in body weight change were observed.

Conclusions
Lotilaner tablets for cats, used at a minimum dose rate
of 6.0 mg/kg, were shown to be effective and safe for the
treatment of tick infestations in cats presented as pa-
tients to veterinary practices under field conditions in
Germany, Hungary and Portugal. Persistent efficacy
lasted for one month and lotilaner was superior to fipro-
nil for efficacy averaged over all time points (P < 0.0001)
as well as on most individual assessment days (day 14 to
70, P < 0.0394), and was non-inferior to fipronil on the
other days. Lotilaner tablets were easy for pet owners to
administer and well accepted by cats.
