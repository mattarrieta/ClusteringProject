Abstract
Background: Lotilaner is a new member of the isoxazoline class for treatment of flea and tick infestations in cats.
This laboratory study with lotilaner vanilla-yeast flavoured chewable tablets (CredelioTM, Elanco) investigated the
safety in healthy kittens starting at 8 weeks of age in a randomized, blinded, parallel-group design. Lotilaner tablets
were given orally once a month over eight months at one, three and five times the upper level of the maximum
recommended dose range (26 mg/kg).
Methods: The safety of lotilaner flavoured chewable tablets was assessed in healthy kittens when administered
orally every 4 weeks for 8 months at the highest recommended dose rates, i.e. 1× (26 mg/kg) and at elevated dose
rates, i.e. 3× (78 mg/kg) and 5× (130 mg/kg). Sixteen male and 16 female healthy 8-week-old kittens, with a mean
body weight of 0.79 kg and 0.75 kg, respectively, were randomized to an untreated control group or lotilaner
groups at dose rates of 26 mg/kg (1×), 78 mg/kg (3×), or 130 mg/kg (5×) every four weeks over eight months. The
control group was sham-dosed. All animals were fed within 30 minutes prior to treatment. Safety assessment
included general health observations, detailed clinical observations, complete physical/neurological examinations,
including ophthalmological examinations, electrocardiographic (ECG) and clinical pathology evaluations
(haematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis), food and water consumption, body weight, pharmacokinetic blood
collections, organ macroscopic and microscopic examinations.
Results: Systemic exposure to lotilaner was confirmed during the course of the study in all treated animals with
the exception of the control group. No treatment-related effects were seen on daily clinical observations, food
consumption (wet), ophthalmoscopic, physical/neurological and microscopic examinations. Statistically significant
differences were recorded in some of the clinical pathology parameters, body weights, food consumption (dry),
electrocardiograms, and organ weights, but none of the recorded observations was considered to be of clinical
relevance.
Conclusions: Lotilaner, when administered once monthly over eight months at the highest recommended dose
and overdoses of three- and five-fold, to 8-week-old healthy kittens, is well tolerated.

Background
Infestation by ticks and fleas is a significant health prob-
lem in cats and dogs as these ectoparasites act as vectors
for several feline or canine zoonotic diseases. Hence,
controlling ticks and fleas is an important part of health
management of pets [1, 2].  While several products are
available for flea control, options for tick control are lim-
ited in cats. In this context, having one product that
treats both ticks and fleas is desirable.
Isoxazolines are a new chemical class of synthetic par-
asiticides demonstrated to be effective against ticks and
fleas [3]. Isoxazolines are safe for mammals due to their
non-competitive antagonism to GABA (gamma-amino-
butyric acid) receptor, with higher selectivity for GABA
receptors in insects or ticks, than for those in mammals,
including humans. They bind to chloride channels in
nerve and muscle cells, which blocks the transmission of
neuronal signals [4–6].
Lotilaner is a novel isoxazoline recently approved as
Credelio™ in dogs. Laboratory and field studies have
established lotilaner as a valuable drug in the manage-
ment of tick and flea infestations in dogs [7–14].  The
drug has a half-life of approximately four weeks in cats
thereby assuring adequate blood levels for at least one
month [15]. Efficacy evaluation of lotilaner was also con-
ducted in cats for the same indication [16–18]. Prior to
approval of the product, its safety must be established in
the target species.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety
of lotilaner flavoured chewable tablets, formulated and
developed specifically for cats, after repeated oral admin-
istration at the maximum recommended dose and mul-
tiple overdoses in eight-week-old kittens. The treated
groups received lotilaner once a month over 8 months.
The recommended (minimum) monthly dose rate of
lotilaner is 6 mg/kg with a weight band of four resulting
in a maximum recommended dose rate of 26 mg/kg.
Methods
Regulatory compliance
This randomized, controlled, blinded study was con-
ducted with reference to the guidelines for evaluating
the target animal safety of new pharmaceuticals (VICH
Guideline 43), and to recognized quality assurance stan-
dards (United States Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Regulations, 21
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 58 and the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Develop-
ment (OECD) Series on Principles of Good Laboratory
Practice and Compliance Monitoring, Number 13)] [19–
21].  This manuscript was prepared in compliance with
the ARRIVE Guidelines Checklist for animal in vivo ex-
periments [22]. 
Animal management
A total of 20 male and 20 female experimentally naïve
domestic short hair kittens approximately 6 weeks of age
at receipt were acclimatized to the controlled environ-
ment for two weeks prior to treatment start to facilitate
baseline data collection. Sixteen male and 16 female ani-
mals (weighing 0.62–0.98 kg and 0.66–0.91 kg, respect-
ively, at randomization) were selected and assigned to
the control or treatment groups on study day -1. Upon
arrival, the cats were group-housed (four/cage, same
sex); on study day -1 and for the whole study period, the
cats were individually housed in stainless steel mobile
cages with plastic-coated mesh flooring containing ani-
mal enrichment. At arrival and through 10 weeks of age,
the animals were offered daily 60 to 80 g of canned food
(Purina Dietetic Management (DM), St-Louis, USA) and
dry food (Lab Diet® Certified Feline Diet #5003, PMI Nu-
trition International, Inc., St-Louis, USA) while after 10
weeks, only dry food was offered ad libitum to all ani-
mals with the exception of limited periods prior to treat-
ment administration. Tap water was available ad libitum
to all animals. On administration days, the cats were
fasted for 6 hours prior to the first dosing which in-
creased by an hour for each subsequent monthly dosing
until 12 h of fasting was reached by the 6th dose. Fasting
duration of a maximum of 12 h was continued subse-
quently. On treatment days, all animals were offered 60
to 80 g (1st through 5th doses) or 120 to 160 g (6th
through 8th dose) of canned food (Purina DM) along
with the daily ration of dry Lab Diet® 30 min prior to
dosing to improve bioavailability [15].
Randomisation, blinding and treatment
Sixteen male and 16 female animals were randomly allo-
cated on study day -1 to the control group or to the
treatment groups based on homogenous distribution of
body weight and sex (4 males and 4 females per group)
(Table 1).  The four groups were: Group 1: untreated
control (sham-dosed with 3 ml of tap water); Group 2:
lotilaner flavoured chewable tablets at a target dose level
of 26 mg/kg (1×); Group 3: lotilaner flavoured chewable
tablets at a target dose level of 78 mg/kg (3×); Group 4:
lotilaner flavoured chewable tablets at a target dose level
of 130 mg/kg (5×).
All personnel were unaware of the treatment group al-
locations except those involved in administration of
treatments. Histopathological evaluation was conducted
unblinded.
Test article administration
The target dose levels were selected based on the mini-
mum therapeutic dose (6 mg/kg), when applying a dose
banding for the available tablet strengths of four times the
target dose rate leading to approximately the maximum

therapeutic dose of 26 mg/kg and the requirement to test
multiples of the maximum therapeutic dose, i.e. 3× and
5× doses. Doses for each individual animal were based on
each body weight measured the day prior to each day of
dosing. Tablets (commercial tablets size, not scored) were
provided, with lotilaner amounts of 12 or 48 mg. An ap-
propriate combination of the smallest, i.e. 12 mg or the
largest, i.e. 48 mg tablets was administered to achieve as
close as possible to the individual target dose. As lotilaner
absorption has been shown to be increased by food, cats
were fed within 30 min prior to each dosing [15].
Tablets were administered per os once every four
weeks for eight months (on study days 1, 29, 57, 85, 113,
141, 169 and 197).  Three milliliters of water was then
given after each administration and the mouth checked
to ensure the tablets had been swallowed. The control
animals were sham-treated with 3 ml of tap water.
General health observations
All animals were observed twice daily approximately 6 h
apart for morbidity, mortality and injury.
Detailed clinical observations, electrocardiographic and
ophthalmoscopic examinations
A detailed clinical examination of each cat was per-
formed on study days -13, -2 and -1 and then on each
dosing day 8 h (± 1 h) post-dose, once weekly thereafter,
and on the day of study completion (study day 225). Ob-
servations included, but were not limited to, evaluation
of skin, fur, eyes, ears, nose, oral cavity, thorax, abdo-
men, external genitalia, limbs and feet, respiratory and
circulatory signs, autonomic effects such as salivation,
and nervous system effects including tremors, convul-
sions, reactivity to handling, and unusual behavior.
Electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings were per-
formed while the cats were under sedation with keta-
mine and acepromazine [0.1 ml/kg body weight of
ketamine (100 mg/ml) and 0.1 ml of acepromazine (10
mg/ml)] during the acclimation phase on study days -6, 
and 59, 143, 199 and 224. The ECG tracings from each
animal were examined by a certified veterinary cardiolo-
gist for the following variables: heart rate, RR interval,
PR interval, QT intervals and QRS duration.
Ophthalmoscopic examinations were conducted by a
board certified ophthalmologist on all animals on study
days -4, 99 and 211.
Body weights and food consumption
Body weights for all animals were recorded during the
acclimation phase (study days -12, -9, -7, -5, -2 and -1)
and at least once weekly during the study. Food con-
sumption (dry and wet food) was measured and re-
corded daily.
Physical/neurological examinations
Complete physical and neurological examinations were
conducted on study days -6, 7, 35, 63, 91, 119, 147, 175,
203 and 224. Assessments of toxicity and health in-
cluded general condition and behavior; general ocular
without ophthalmoscope; integument; musculoskeletal;
gastrointestinal; body temperature; cardiovascular and
respiratory including assessment by auscultation; repro-
ductive system; lymphatic, urinary and nervous systems.
The neurological assessment included observation for
nystagmus, pupillary response, extensor thrust (muscle
tone), righting reflex, startle reflex, proprioception, and
locomotor activity.
Clinical pathology and urinalysis
Blood samples were collected from each animal from
the jugular vein for the evaluation of hematology, clin-
ical chemistry and coagulation variables at pre-test
(study day -8 for hematology and clinical chemistry;
study day -5 for urinalysis and study day -1 for coagula-
tion),  and on study days 8, 28, 36, 56, 64, 84, 92, 112,
120, 140, 148, 168, 176, 196, 204 and 223. Urine samples
were collected (prior to study day -4, 7 days after the
first dose; then prior to and 7 days after each subsequent
Page 4

dose, and prior to termination) by replacing the litter in
the litter box with NoSorb® for at least 16 h. The
hematology profile included the following parameters:
leukocyte count (total and absolute differential), erythro-
cyte count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular
hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscu-
lar hemoglobin concentration (calculated),  reticulocytes
(aggregate and punctuate) and platelet count. The co-
agulation parameters included prothrombin time, acti-
vated partial thromboplastin time (APTT),  and
fibrinogen. The clinical chemistry profile included alka-
line phosphatase, total bilirubin (with direct bilirubin if
total bilirubin exceeded 1 mg/dl), aspartate aminotrans-
ferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl trans-
ferase, urea nitrogen, creatinine, total protein, albumin,
globulin and albumin/globulin ratio (calculated), glucose,
total cholesterol, triglycerides, electrolytes (sodium, po-
tassium, chloride),  calcium and phosphorus. Urinalysis
included the determination of volume, color and appear-
ance, specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, bilirubin, ke-
tones, blood, leukocytes, urobilinogen and microscopy of
centrifuged sediment.
Whole blood and pharmacokinetic analysis
For pharmacokinetic determination, blood samples were
collected from all animals via the jugular vein for the
determination of whole blood concentrations of lotilaner
at predose (study day -1, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, 169 and
197);  4 h post-dose on study day 1; predose and 4 h
post-dose on study day 113; 24 h post-dose on study
days 2, 30, 58, 86, 114, 142, 170 and 198; and on study
days 4, 8, 15, 22, 116, 120, 127, 134, 200, 204, 211, 218
and 225. The samples were analyzed for determination
of lotilaner concentrations using a validated method by
HPLC-MS/MS [15].  The pharmacokinetic parameters
were calculated from the individual concentration vs
time profiles via non-compartmental analysis. The phar-
macokinetic parameters included peak values (Cmax
), ter-
minal half-life (T1/2
),  area under the curve (AUC),  and
accumulation ratio.
Gross and microscopic evaluations
At study termination (study day 225), the cats were hu-
manely euthanized by an intravenous injection of so-
dium pentobarbital solution followed by exsanguination.
Gross examinations of tissues were carried out on all an-
imals according to VICH GL 43 under the supervision
of a veterinary pathologist [19].  Microscopic examina-
tions were done by a  board certified veterinary
pathologist.
Statistical methods
All statistical analyses were performed using software
package SAS/STAT® (Version 14.1, Version 9.4 of the 
SAS System for Windows, Copyright© 2002-2012 by
SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Endpoints measured once post-treatment (organ
weights and pharmacokinetic parameters) that did not
include a pre-treatment measurement were analyzed
using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with ‘treatment’,
‘sex’,  and ‘treatment by sex’  as fixed effects [23].  End-
points measured multiple times post-treatment that in-
cluded a pre-treatment measurement (body weights,
ECG parameters, clinical chemistry, hematology, urinaly-
sis, coagulation, dry food consumption, and wet food
consumption) were analyzed using repeated measures
analysis of covariance (RMANCOVA) with ‘treatment’,
‘time’,  and ‘sex’;  the two-way interactions ‘treatment by
time’, ‘treatment by sex’, and ‘sex by time’; the three-way
interaction ‘treatment by time by sex’ and a covariate all
as fixed effects [24]. The pre-treatment value closest to
dosing was used as the covariate.
If the interaction terms were significant (P ≤ 0.10 level
for two-way interactions and P ≤ 0.05 for the three-way
interaction), treated groups were compared to the con-
trol either within each sex (treatment by sex significant),
within each time point (treatment by time significant) or
main effect only (neither treatment by sex nor treatment
by time significant).

Results and discussion
Dose administration
During the dosing period of the study, the mean doses
of lotilaner administered for 1×, 3× and 5×, were 26.61,
79.26 and 131.24 mg/kg, respectively, for males, and
26.67, 79.28 and 131.30 mg/kg, respectively, for females.
Thus, the target dose rate planned in the dosage group
was achieved for all test article treated animals.
General health, detailed clinical observations and
ophthalmoscopic evaluations
No mortality was observed during the course of the
study with the exception of one death of one female kit-
ten (3× group: 78 mg/kg),  which was found dead on
study day 143. The animal had been anesthetized prior
to electrocardiogram measurement; however, during
monitoring at the time of removal for the procedure she
was found dead in the cage. There were no macroscopic
observations in this animal and microscopic findings
were limited to mild unilateral tubular regeneration in
the kidneys. Due to the focal unilateral distribution, low
severity, and the presence of similar findings in multiple
animals at the terminal necropsy including controls, this
kidney finding was not considered to be related to test
article administration and was considered not to be the
primarily cause for this animal’s death during anesthesia.

The animal’s death was considered most likely an aber-
rant response to anesthesia. Thus, there were no
treatment-related adverse findings in general health ob-
servations. No clinical signs associated with lotilaner ad-
ministration at the tested doses were noted during the
study. Occasional findings observed, such as abdominal
distension, soft/watery feces, mild prolapsed rectum,
swollen muzzle, and scabbed areas at random sites, were
considered incidental since they commonly occurred in
animals of this strain and age, were present at a low inci-
dence, were observed in control animals as well, and/or
were not dose-dependent.
No treatment-related effects were observed during
ophthalmoscopic examinations. One female at 78 mg/kg
(3× group) had chorioretinitis in the right eye at the in-
terim (study day 99) and terminal (study day 211) exam-
inations. The finding was considered incidental since it
was seen in only one mid-dose animal and was present
in only one eye.
Body weights and food consumption
Body weights of the males at 78 mg/kg (3×) were signifi-
cantly lower (t(27) 
= 2.69, P = 0.0122) than those of the
control males, averaged over all time points. Since no ef-
fects were observed in males at the higher dose of 130
mg/kg (5×), dose-dependency to treatment could not be
established. This correlates with the reduction in food 
consumption in this group of males. No effects on body
weight were observed in females at any dose level. Food
consumption was reduced in treated males (3×) com-
pared to controls, but not in females. The changes were
minor and considered non adverse. The reduction in
food consumption only correlated to decreased body
weight in males at 78 mg/kg (3×). Wet food consump-
tion was reduced in males at 26 mg/kg (1×) level com-
pared to controls. This was considered most likely
incidental to treatment since it was not seen at the
higher doses in males or in females at any dose level.
Therefore, it was concluded that the test article had no
significant effect on body weights or food consumption.
Physical/neurological examinations
No clinically relevant abnormalities attributable to the
treatment were observed during scheduled physical/
neurological examinations.
Electrocardiographic evaluations
No changes were recorded after auscultation in all treated
groups. All electrocardiograms were qualitatively and
quantitatively within normal limits with the exception of
one animal treated at 130 mg/kg (5×) where an electrical
alternans on the terminal ECG was recorded. Intraventric-
ular conduction disturbances are not uncommon in cats
[25].  Intraventricular conduction disturbances were not

associated with clinical signs and hence the conduction

When absolute group mean values were evaluated sta-
tistically and compared to interval matched vehicle con-
trol values, the only significant differences involved the
QRS duration (at days 199 (t(69) 
= 1.72, P = 0.0892) and
224 (t(69) 
= 2.22, P = 0.0299) at 1× and at day 59 at 5×
(t(70) 
= 1.81, P = 0.0748). The QRS duration was shorter
in the 1× group at study day 199 and terminal intervals
and longer in the 5× group at study day 59 interval
(Table 2). As the magnitude of the differences was mild,
the changes were in opposite directions and only oc-
curred at one of the high dose intervals with no repro-
ducibility, the differences are likely due to normal
biological variability and not a test article effect.
Clinical pathology
Statistically significant decreases in neutrophils were ob-
served in males and females at multiple time points
(study day 8 through 223; for males: up to t(25) 
= 3.60, P
= 0.0014; for females: up to t(24) 
= 4.22, P = 0.0003) at
all dose levels in comparison with control animals (Table
3). This finding was considered test article-related, based
on its consistency over time and in both sexes, but con-
sidered not to have clinical relevance due to the absence
of other correlating abnormalities in other parameters.
There were statistically significant decreases in APTT in
females overall (all time points combined) at 1× (t(15) 
=
2.02, P = 0.0606) and 3× (t(15) 
= 1.84, P = 0.0855), rela-
tive to controls. There were also significant decreases
(up to t(34) 
= 2.08, P = 0.0457) in prothrombin times at
multiple time points (study day 36 through 223) at 1×,
3× and 5×. There were statistically significant increases
in globulin in pooled (both sexes) on study day 56 at 3×
(t(26) 
= 1.88, P = 0.0709),  and cholesterol in pooled 
samples at multiple time points (study day 36 through
223) at 3× and 5× (up to t(17) 
= 4.11, P = 0.0008). These
effects were minor, did not follow a consistent dose re-
sponse, lacked correlation to pathology or other study
endpoints and generally remained within expected his-
torical ranges and hence considered not clinically rele-
vant. There were no treatment-related changes in
urinalysis parameters.
Organ weights and gross and microscopic examinations
There were no lotilaner-related macroscopic findings at
terminal necropsy. Statistically significant absolute organ
weight changes in the spleen, relative organ weight
changes in adrenal and kidney, and both absolute and
relative organ weight changes in brain and thyroids/
parathyroids (relative) were considered incidental since
there were no microscopic correlates or relevant clinical
pathology changes. No definitive test article-related
changes were observed microscopically.
Pharmacokinetic analysis
Regarding pharmacokinetics, lotilaner was not quantifiable
(below LLOQ) in any untreated animals (control group).
The variability of lotilaner Cmax 
and AUC0-672h 
was similar
between animals and months throughout the study. This
demonstrates consistent and adequate exposure of all
treated cats. Mean systemic exposure (AUC0-672h
) and Cmax
values of lotilaner increased with increasing dose in a less
than dose proportional manner, especially in the 5× group,
which was approximately 3-fold instead of 5-fold (Fig. 1). A
moderate degree of accumulation (from single treatment to
steady state (approximately 5 months) with an accumula-
tion ratio of approximately 2) was observed for lotilaner.
This was expected as a normal consequence of the rela-
tively long half-life (approximately 4 weeks) of the product.

Conclusions
Lotilaner, when administered once monthly over eight
months at the highest recommended dose and overdoses
of three and five-fold, to 8-week-old healthy kittens, is
well tolerated. The results show that lotilaner flavoured
chewable tablets have a wide safety margin when admin-
istered at monthly intervals to kittens and cats, male or
female, at the highest dose band rate of 26 mg/kg.
