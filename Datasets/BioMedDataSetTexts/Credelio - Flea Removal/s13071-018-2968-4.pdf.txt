Abstract
Background: Lotilaner, approved for dogs as a chewable tablet formulation, has separately been developed for oral
use in cats (CredelioTM chewable tablets for cats), to meet the need for an easy to use, safe and rapidly effective
parasiticide. It is a valid cat- and owner-friendly alternative to topical products. This manuscript describes three
pivotal laboratory studies assessing the efficacy and speed of kill of lotilaner in cats against Ixodes ricinus ticks
following a single oral administration, at a dose rate close to 6 mg/kg.
Methods: In Studies 1 and 2, efficacy and safety were evaluated 48 h after treatment and post-treatment weekly
infestations in 16 cats, against untreated controls, for 35 days. In Study 3, efficacy and safety were assessed in 8
lotilaner-treated cats until Day 35, before and after 24 h incubation of the female live ticks removed from the
animals 12, 18 and 24 h after dosing and subsequent weekly infestations.
Results: Efficacy was > 99% on days 23 and 37, and 100% on all other timepoints in Study 1. In Study 2 it was >
98% on Days 9 and 37, and 100% on all other days. In Study 3, on Day 0, lotilaner was > 90% efficacious, pre- and
post-incubation at all time-points. On Day 7, at 12 hours after infestation, efficacy was 100%, pre- and post-
incubation. On Day 14, there was a 66.5% reduction in geometric mean live tick counts in treated cats compared to
controls, increasing, after incubation, to 94.4%. Afterwards, efficacy decreased below 90% while tick counts in the
treated groups remained significantly lower compared to controls. At 18 hours, lotilaner was ≥ 90% efficacious
through Day 37, increasing to 100% at 24 hours, on all study days, with the exception of Day 28 (98.9 and 99.1%
pre- and post-incubation, respectively). There were no treatment-related adverse events.
Conclusions: At the minimum dose rate of 6 mg/kg, lotilaner was efficacious against I. ricinus ticks. In addition,
lotilaner was effective against this tick within 12 hours of treatment, reaching 100% efficacy within 24 hours.
Lotilaner sustained a rapid kill of newly infesting I. ricinus through 35 days. By quickly killing ticks that infest cats,
lotilaner has the potential to contribute to the reduction of tick-borne pathogens transmission.

Background
Lotilaner is the latest member of the isoxazolines, the
newest ectoparasiticide class of compounds marketed
for companion animals. Formulated as chewable tablets,
it was approved for the treatment of tick and flea infes-
tations in dogs (CredelioTM chewable tablets for dogs;
Elanco Europe Ltd.) [1–3]. After oral administration to
an infested animal, this broad-spectrum parasiticide in-
hibits the gamma/aminobutyric acid-gated chloride
channels of the ticks and fleas, resulting in rapid death
of the parasites [4–6].
At present, no isoxazoline-containing ectoparasiticide
for oral administration is available for the treatment of
tick and flea infestations in cats. Isoxazolines, fluralaner
(Bravecto®spot-on solution for cats; MSD Animal Health,
Madison, NJ, USA), and sarolaner in combination with
selamectin, (Stronghold Plus, Zoetis Belgium SA, Louvain-
la-Neuve, Belgium),  are approved for cats as topical
spot-on applications.
In a market research performed during the lotilaner
development programme (unpublished data), cat owners
commonly expressed clear, negative feelings related to the
administration of topical spot-on products, considering
them disruptive of the owner-animal bond. Many owners
responded welcoming the idea of an easy-to-administer
flavoured, chewable oral tick and flea parasiticide for cats.
A small, flavoured, cat-friendly, oral tablet would therefore
be a valuable novel product able to fill the gap in tick and
flea treatment of cats.
In a number of pivotal field and laboratory studies, the
efficacy and clinical safety of lotilaner (CredelioTM chew-
able tablets for cats, Elanco) against fleas (C. felis) and
ticks (Ixodes ricinus) for 1 month, following oral admin-
istration at the minimum dose rate of 6 mg/kg, was con-
firmed [7–9].
The safety of the product was assessed in a pivotal tol-
erance study in which CredelioTM was shown to be safe
in 8-week-old kittens, at dose rates up to 130 mg lotila-
ner/kg administered monthly, for 8 months [10].
This manuscript describes three pivotal laboratory
studies assessing the efficacy of lotilaner (CredelioTM
chewable tablets for cats) in cats experimentally infested
with adult Ixodes ricinus ticks. Studies 1 and 2 assessed
the efficacy of the product following a single oral admin-
istration at a dose rate of at least 6 mg/kg and as close as
possible to this target dose, for five weeks. Study 3 evalu-
ated the speed of kill of lotilaner tablets against adult I.
ricinus ticks, 12, 18 and 24 hours post-treatment and sub-
sequent weekly infestations, following a single oral admin-
istration to cats, at the same dose rate.
Methods
These pivotal studies were performed in two different la-
boratories, with a randomized, blinded, parallel-group 
design. All studies were performed under GCP standards
[11] and in compliance with the EU and WAAVP Guide-
lines for the testing and evaluation of the efficacy of an-
tiparasitic substances for the treatment and prevention
of tick and flea infestation in dogs and cats [12–14].
In each study, one (Studies 1 and 2) or more (Study 3),
groups of eight lotilaner-treated cats were compared, for
efficacy and safety, to an equal number of untreated
negative control groups of the same size, after infestation
with laboratory-bred I. ricinus ticks.
Animals
In Study 1, European domestic shorthair cats were in-
cluded; European mixed breed cats were enrolled in
Studies 2 and 3. To be included, cats had to be at least
12 months (Study 1) or 7 months-old (Studies 2 and 3)
and to be acclimatized to the study housing and conditions;
they had to be healthy and non-pregnant, have undergone
a sufficient washout period after previous treatments with
acaricidal products, and have had a female tick attachment
rate of at least 25% from an infestation performed approxi-
mately 1 week before the day of study treatment. In order
for the lotilaner dose rate to be as close as possible to the
minimum target of 6 mg/kg, cat bodyweight had to be in
the ranges of 3.10–4.00 kg, 4.60–6.00 kg and 6.20–8.00 kg.
In Studies 1 and 2, 22 healthy cats of both sexes were
selected for the acclimatisation period. In Study 3, 58
cats were acclimatised. Sixteen cats fulfilling all the in-
clusion criteria, no exclusion criteria, and with the highest
female tick attachment rates in the pre-treatment infest-
ation suitability test, were included in either Study 1 or 2.
Forty-eight cats meeting the same inclusion/exclusion cri-
teria were included in Study 3.
Cats in Study 1 were housed in isolated rooms of
equal size and with the same environmental conditions.
Each room had two identical pens. Cats were housed in
groups of three or four in each pen. After randomization,
the eight cats of the same treatment group were housed in
the same room (four cats per pen).  Both sexes were
allowed, as all males included in the study were neutered.
Studies 2 and 3 were performed at a different test site;
in both studies, animals of the same sex were pair-
housed within the same treatment group.
In all experiments, after each tick infestation (i.e. from
the infestation until completion of the tick count), cats
were housed in individual cages for 48 h (± 2 h), with
the exception of the infestation on Day -2, after which,
cats were individually housed for 96 h (± 2 h), until Day 2.
Randomisation
Cats fulfilling all inclusion criteria, no exclusion criteria,
with at least a 25% attachment rate (live, attached, female
ticks) and having the highest tick counts were included in
the studies. For the randomization, cats were rank-ordered
Page 3

from highest to lowest pre-treatment infestation test tick
counts and randomly allocated within blocks of two (Studies
1 and 2) or six (Study 3), to treatment groups. Cats of the
same treatment group (and sex in studies 2 and 3) were ran-
domly allocated to housing pairs.
Blinding
Blinding was accomplished by separation of function.
Study personnel responsible for general health observa-
tions, clinical observations, physical examinations and
tick counting were blinded throughout the study. Only
the sponsor’s representative, statistician, investigator, moni-
tor and individuals responsible for the Investigational Vet-
erinary Product (IVP) administration were aware of the
treatment allocation of each cat. All documents where the
cats’ group allocation was visible were kept inaccessible to
blinded personnel and cats’  allocation was identified via
study room numbers during the study. Blinding was main-
tained throughout all studies.
Tick infestation and counting
Cats were experimentally infested with 50 ± 2 viable,
unfed, adult, uniform in age, I. ricinus ticks (sex ratio
approximately 70% female: 30% male) during the
acclimatization period (pre-treatment infestation test
to assess tick viability and cats individual tick retention
rate) and on Days -2, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. To help tick at-
tachment, cats were infested under sedation, according to
laboratory standard practice: in Study 1 with intramus-
cular injection of medetomidine hydrochloride at 0.02
mg/kg and butorphanol at 0.1 mg/kg. In Study 2, sed-
ation with 0.08 mg/kg medetomidine hydrochloride by
intramuscular injection, was reversed ~90 min later
using atipamezole hydrochloride administered by intra-
muscular injection at a dose rate of 0.2 mg/kg. Following
sedation, cats were placed inside infestation cages and
ticks released on the animals.
Tick removal and counts were conducted on Days -14
or -5 (Study 1 and 2, respectively, suitability test),  on
Day 2 at 48 ± 2 h after treatment administration as well
as on Days 9, 16, 23, 30 and 37 (at 48 ± 2 h
post-infestation).

In Study 3, tick counts with removal were performed
on all cats on Day - 6, 48 h post-infestation. Additional
counts were performed 12, 18 or 24 h post-treatment
(Groups 1 and 4, 2 and 5, 3 and 6, respectively) on Day
0 and after new infestations (Days 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36)
(Table 1).
Tick counts were performed according to each test
facility’s  standard procedure. Briefly, the procedure
mainly consisted of a thorough examination of all body
areas by palpation with the fingers tips (thumb counting)
first to locate and count the attached and free ticks.
Since only female Ixodes spp. ticks attach to the host
[15], male ticks were not counted and not considered in
any efficacy and attachment rate assessments. Ticks
were categorized as free or attached and as alive or dead.
Ticks were considered alive if their legs reacted to a tact-
ile or CO2 
stimulus (exhaled air) and were considered
dead if they did not. They were considered attached if
the tick’s mouthpart was firmly attached to the cat’s skin
and were considered free if not. After count and
categorization, ticks were discarded, with the exception
of Study 3, in which, after removal from the animals, live
ticks (free and attached) were incubated into a con-
trolled environment (at 26–29°C and 70–90% relative
humidity) and their viability re-assessed after 24 h.
Treatment
All cats in the treatment groups received a single oral
administration of the IVP (lotilaner, minimum dose rate
of 6 mg/kg and as close as possible to this dose) on Day
0. Mock dosing was performed for the untreated con-
trols. Treatment was administered 30 ± 5 min following
feeding. Lotilaner was available in two tablet sizes (final
formulation) of 12 and 48 mg, respectively. Administra-
tion was based on Day -2 body weights (Table 2).
Study assessments
Efficacy
In Studies 1 and 2, efficacy was defined as the ability of
lotilaner tablets to reduce tick infestations (live female
ticks only) on cats, 48 h after treatment and 48 h after
each post-treatment infestation. In Study 3, efficacy was
defined as the ability of lotilaner tablets to reduce the fe-
male live I. ricinus tick counts on the cats on Day 0, 12
h after treatment, on Day 1, 18 or 24 h after treatment,

on Days 7, 14, 21, 28 or 35, 12 h after tick infestation
and on Days 8, 15, 22, 29 or 36, 18 and 24 h after tick
infestation. In this study, efficacy was calculated for each
time-point both before and after 24 h incubation of the
live female ticks collected from the cats.
Lotilaner was considered effective against I. ricinus if
efficacy was > 90.0% (female live ticks only) in the
treated group versus the untreated control group at the
evaluation time-point, provided that the infestation was
adequate in the corresponding control group (average
female ticks attachment rate of at least 25%),  and the
difference in live female ticks counts between treated
and control groups was statistically significant (P < 0.05)
between the two groups, with a significant decrease in
tick counts in the treated group compared with controls
using ANOVA.
Efficacy was calculated based on the percent reduction
in female live tick arithmetic or geometric mean counts
in the treated group compared with those in the corre-
sponding control group using the Abbott’s formula:
Efficacy ð  Þ ¼ %  100 Â ð  Þ MC−MT =MC
where MC is the arithmetic or geometric mean num-
ber of female live ticks on cats in the untreated control
group and MT is the arithmetic or geometric mean
number of female live ticks on treated cats.
Geometric mean calculation involved using the loga-
rithm of the tick count of each animal; when any tick
count was equal to zero, one was added to the count
and later subtracted from the resultant calculated geo-
metric mean prior to calculating percent effectiveness.
Safety
The general health of all cats was observed by a trained
technician once daily from the start of the acclimatization
phase to the end of study, with the exception of the study
days in which clinical observations were performed by a
veterinarian (Day 0 both pre-treatment and 1, 6 and 8 h
following treatment administration). Clinical observations
included general health, behaviour and appetite. Thorough
physical examinations were performed by a veterinarian 
during acclimatization, to evaluate whether cats’  health
allowed for their inclusion in the study and at study com-
pletion. All cats were monitored for adverse events (AEs)
and serious adverse events (SAEs) throughout the study.
Bodyweight was measured in fasted animals on Days -16,
-2, 19, 26, 33 and 40 in Study 1 and on Days -8, -2 and 37
in Studies 2 and 3.
Statistical analyses
All efficacy analyses were performed in the intent-to-

sets, which included all randomized animals that re-
ceived the IVP or were left untreated, or all treated and
untreated animals with no major deviations, respectively.
All animals that received treatment were included in
safety analyses (i.e. bodyweight and adverse events).
Eight animals per group were considered an adequate
sample size as a minimum of six subjects per group is
recommended by the EMEA and the WAAVP guidelines
[12, 14]. All hypotheses were tested at a two-sided 0.05
level of significance. All analyses were performed using
the SAS/STAT® software.
To test the sensitivity of the model, an analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) using logarithmically transformed counts
(live attached + live unattached female ticks) was per-
formed for the treated and control groups. Models in-
cluded fixed the “Treatment” effect and random “Block”
effect.
The following hypotheses were tested for Studies 1
and 2. Separate calculations were performed for each
time point:
H0: Treatment group count = Negative control group
count
HA: Treatment group count ≠ Negative control group
count
When at least one tick count was equal to zero, one
was added to the count before logarithm calculation for
every animal in every treatment group prior to perform-
ing the transformation. Because it was likely that the

assumption of normal distribution of log-transformed
tick count was not valid, non-parametric methods were
additionally used to compare the two groups (Mann-
Whitney U-test) only in Study 1.
In all studies, tick infestation was considered adequate
at each time point when the group mean female tick re-
tention rate on the control animals was at least 25%, in
compliance with the EU guidelines [12, 13].
ANOVA was used to compare the treated group with
the untreated controls, with a fixed effect of “Treatment
Group” and random effect of “Block”.
In Study 3, tick count data before and after incuba-
tion on a given measurement day/hour were compared
separately between each control and treated group using
ANOVA and logarithmically transformed counts. The
model included the fixed effects of “Time (prior or post)”
and “Subject”.
Bodyweight changes were calculated as the change in
baseline weight (weight closest to dosing) to weight at
the end of the biological phase and analysed using an
ANOVA (SAS PROC MIXED) with a fixed “Group,”
“Treatment” and “Treatment Group” effect in Studies 1, 
2 and 3, respectively, and a random “Block” effect in all
three studies.
Adverse events were described and counted.

Results
Efficacy
Adequacy of infestation
An adequate female tick infestation rate of ≥ 25% in the
control groups was achieved at each study time point in
all three studies; mean retention rates ranged between
52.5–70.7% in Study 1, 47.9–60.7% in Study 2 and 37.5–
50.4% both pre- and post-incubation in Study 3.
Calculated efficacy and difference in live tick counts
between treatment groups
In Studies 1 and 2, the difference in live, female I. rici-
nus geometric mean tick counts between the treated
and untreated groups was statistically significant at all
assessment time-points, with significantly lower counts

in the lotilaner-treated groups (P < 0.0001; all days)
(Tables 3 and 4).
Efficacy was > 90% on all assessment days. In Study 1,
the efficacy was > 99% on Days 23 and 37, and 100% on
all other timepoints (Table 3).
In Study 2, the efficacy of lotilaner was > 98% on Day 9,
> 99% on Day 37 and 100% on all other days (Table 4).
In Study 3 there was a statistically significant differ-
ence (P ≤ 0.0182) in female live tick counts, before or
after incubation, between each treated group compared
to the corresponding untreated one, at all time-points,
with lower counts in the treated groups (Tables 5, 6,
7 and 8).
Mean live tick counts before and after incubation,
were not significantly different, in the control groups at
any time points (P > 0.05; Figs. 1 and 2).
In the treated group assessed at the 12 h time-point,
post-incubation live tick counts were significantly lower
(P < 0.05) compared to the pre-incubation counts on Days
0, 14, 21, 28 and 35. For the group assessed at the 18 h as-
sessment point, post-incubation live tick counts were sig-
nificantly lower (P < 0.05) on Days 15 and 22, while for
the treated group assessed at the 24 h time-point, no 
significant difference between pre- and post-incubation
live tick counts was observed.
The efficacy of lotilaner after treatment administration
(on a pre-existing infestation established on Day -2) met
the > 90% threshold requirement laid out by the EU
Guideline, at all time-points (Table 5 and Fig. 3).
At the 12 h post-challenge assessment, lotilaner efficacy
was 100% (pre- and post-incubation) on Day 7. On Day 14,
the efficacy was 66.5% and 94.4% pre-and post-incubation,
respectively, subsequently decreasing to values below the
90% efficacy threshold (Fig. 3 and Table 6). At the 18 h as-
sessment, lotilaner met the efficacy threshold through Day
37 (Fig. 3 and Table 7) and increased to 100% at the 24 h
time-point, on all study days, except for Day 28 (> 98%)
(Fig. 3 and Table 8).
Across all post-treatment challenges, few live ticks
were detected on lotilaner-treated cats.
Safety observations
Abnormal signs were reported for two control cats in
Study 2 and for 22 and 19 treated and control cats, re-
spectively, in Study 3. In Study 1, mild or moderate

ported for all cats. Body weight changes from baseline
recorded during the studies were not statistically sig-
nificant (P > 0.05). Weight loss in Study 1 and Study 3
was similar in all treatment groups and improved after
increase of the daily ration. In Study 1, two and three
episodes of loose stool in the IVP and untreated group,
respectively, were reported, as well as one episode of
mild vomiting in two IVP cats, 14 and 19 days after
dosing, respectively. None of these observations was
considered treatment-related.
Discussion
Study 1 and 2 confirmed that the dose rate of 6 mg/kg
selected in the dose determination study (undisclosed
data) was sufficient to control I. ricinus infestation for a 
duration of one month with efficacy close to or at 100%
to Day 35.
Study 3 demonstrated that I. ricinus ticks present
on cats before lotilaner administration are killed at 12
hours after dosing. Tick incubation in an environment
aimed at preserving their viability, showed that the
product starts killing new ticks infesting cats after
treatment as soon as 12 hours after infestation, reach-
ing the 90% efficacy threshold at 18 hours and 100%
killing at 24 hours (with the exclusion of the 28 days
time-point, where efficacy was 98.9 and 99.1% pre- or
post-incubation, respectively).  The soundness of the ex-
perimental methodology was demonstrated by the absence
of a statistically significant difference between pre- and
post-incubation live tick numbers in the control groups
(Figs. 1 and 2). This confirmed that untreated ticks were

not affected by the incubation and that the significant de-
crease in live tick counts in the lotilaner groups
post-incubation was a true treatment effect. The rapid on-
set of activity against ticks is consistent with lotilaner’s
rapid speed of kill against fleas [7] and pharmacokinetics
data showing that, in cats, lotilaner is readily absorbed and
reaches peak blood concentrations within four hours [16].
The somewhat faster onset of activity of lotilaner im-
mediately after dosing can be explained by the fact that
ticks already present on the animals at the time of
treatment are immediately exposed to its activity, with
no time required to select the attachment spot and start
feeding.
Adequate mean tick attachment rates in the control
groups at all time points validated the cat infestation
model and confirmed the validity of the calculated efficacy
results. Efficacy and speed of kill were confirmed for 35
days in all studies, giving some flexibility to the 30 days 
administration schedule recommended on the product
label.
No other oral isoxazoline is available for cats at the
time this paper is being written. Lotilaner appears to act
faster against ticks present on cats at the time of treat-
ment than the other systemically acting isoxazolines
available as topical solutions. Fluralaner and sarolaner la-
bels indicate onsets of action of 48 and 24 hours, re-
spectively, on both pre-existing and new infestations.
Against new infestations, lotilaner, with its onset of ac-
tion of 18–24 hours (depending on whether pre- or
post-incubation data and geometric or arithmetic means
are considered),  throughout five weeks, appears to be
faster than fluralaner while comparing favourably with
sarolaner [17].
Our studies were performed in compliance with the
EU Guidelines current at the time the trials were per-
formed [12],  with the exception of tick categorisation,

for which no assessment of tick engorgement was done.
This is in line with the new EU [13] and WAAVP [14]
guidelines and provides a sound scientific approach for
systemically acting parasiticides.
To be exposed to lotilaner and other isoxazolines, para-
sites need to start blood-feeding. For a systemically acting
product to be able to reduce the risk of parasite-borne dis-
eases, speed of kill is therefore of major importance. There
is conflicting evidence as to whether systemically acting
isoxazolines could be as effective as topically acting che-
micals, which may have some repellent activity, in redu-
cing the risk of tick-borne pathogen transmission.
Transmission of pathogens such as Borrelia, Anaplasma
and Babesia species from tick to pet hosts, is reported
to typically start at least 48 hours (16 hours in some
cases) after tick attachment [18–20]. Although the pos-
sibility of an earlier transmission cannot be completely
excluded because of the possible release of pathogens
from the ticks’ salivary glands during the process of at-
tachment, with its speed of kill, lotilaner can contribute
to reducing the risk of transmission of tick-borne
pathogens.
The comparison of pre- and post-incubation data from
treated cats in our study showed that, even for those
ticks that are still live when removed from the animals
at the earliest time-points, viability is already affected by
the activity of lotilaner. This is reinforced by the obser-
vation that in the treated groups, the difference in live
tick counts before and after incubation is significant at
the 12 and 18 hours time-points, but not at the 24 hours
assessment. This shows that ticks removed from the ani-
mals at the earliest time-points, although still alive, are
already affected by the treatment and die during incuba-
tion. At the later assessment time point (i.e. 24 h), time
on the animals was enough for ticks to die and incuba-
tion did not significantly impact their viability. As ticks
become moribund, an impact on engorgement and
transmission of pathogens cannot be excluded suggest-
ing that, although not investigated in our study, protec-
tion against tick-borne diseases would start earlier than
the actual tick death time-point. Lotilaner has, therefore,
the potential to be considered as a safe and effective
means of reducing the incidence of tick-borne diseases.
Conclusions
At the minimum dose rate of 6 mg/kg, lotilaner was well
tolerated and efficacious against I. ricinus ticks. In
addition, lotilaner was effective against this tick species
within 12 hours of treatment, reaching 100% efficacy
within 24 hours. It sustained a rapid kill of newly infesting
I. ricinus through 35 days. By quickly killing ticks that in-
fest cats, lotilaner has the potential to contribute to the re-
duction of tick-borne pathogens transmission.
