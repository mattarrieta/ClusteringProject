Abstract
Background: Lotilaner is approved for dogs as a chewable tablet formulation. It has separately been developed for
oral administration in cats (Credelio™ chewable tablets for cats) to meet the need for an easy to use, safe and
rapidly effective parasiticide and as an alternative to topical products. This paper describes two pivotal laboratory
studies assessing the efficacy and speed of kill of lotilaner in cats against Ctenocephalides felis fleas following a
single oral administration, at the minimum recommended dose rate of 6 mg/kg.
Methods: Two GCP (Good Clinical Practice), blinded, randomized, negative-controlled, parallel-groups, laboratory
studies were performed. In both studies, lotilaner was administered once, per os, at the minimum recommended
dose of 6 mg/kg. Study 1 evaluated the efficacy of lotilaner tablets for cats against adult C. felis in experimentally
infested cats, 24 h after treatment and after new weekly infestations, until day 35. Study 2 evaluated the speed of
kill of lotilaner against C. felis, in cats, 8 and 12 h after treatment and after each subsequent weekly infestation,
through day 35. In both studies, for each assessed time point, animals were randomized 1:1 to a lotilaner-treated or
a contemporaneous negative control group of 8 cats each.
Results: In both studies, the infestation in the control groups was adequate at all assessment times. In Study 1,
efficacy at 24 h was 100% at all time points. In Study 2, efficacy was ≥ 97.4% at the 8 h and ≥ 98.6% at the 12 h
time point, through one month. Lotilaner was well tolerated, with no product-related adverse events reported.
Conclusions: Lotilaner administered orally to cats at the minimum recommended dose rate of 6 mg/kg was effective
as early as 8 hours post-administration and at 8 hours after subsequent weekly infestations of adult C. felis for at least
one month. The product was well-tolerated.

Background
Although in the last decades, a number of new molecules
have been approved and marketed for flea control in cats,
with few exceptions, the most widely used route of adminis-
tration has been the topical route. Topical flea control prod-
ucts have to be applied carefully directly to the pet’s skin and
can potentially lead to pesticide exposure of all household
members. It is also recognized that skin concentrations may
unpredictably decline over the protection period following

treatment, because of factors such as climate and water
exposure [1].  Long-acting orally administered products
overcome these shortcomings with the added advantage of
potential to kill fleas more rapidly than topically applied flea
control products, possibly because of the time needed for a
topically applied product to homogeneously distribute from
the site of application to the whole-body surface [2, 3]. Rapid
killing of fleas is desirable to quickly remove the source of irri-
tation from biting fleas, which can cause allergic dermatitis [4]
and to break the flea life-cycle by preventing egg production.

acid (GABA)-gated chloride channels (GABACls) and
glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls) leading to a
progressive and irreversible paralysis of insects and acar-
ines [5, 6].  They have been shown to be effective in
treating ectoparasitic infestations in dogs [5–7]. The first
approved isoxazolines (afoxolaner, fluralaner and sarola-
ner) are available as oral formulations for the treatment
of flea and tick infestations in dogs.
The only isoxazolines approved for use in cats have
been available for topical application, so far: fluralaner
(Bravecto® spot-on solution for cats; Merck Animal
Health, Madison, NJ, USA) and sarolaner in combin-
ation with selamectin (Stronghold® Plus spot-on solution
for cats; Zoetis Belgium SA, Louvain-la-Neuve) [8, 9].
Lotilaner (Credelio™, Elanco, Greenfield, IN, USA) is the
newest member of this class and is available as a flavoured
chewable tablet formulation for dogs [10]. In order to fulfil
the need for a rapidly effective, orally administered ecto-
parasiticide with activity against ticks and fleas in cats and
kittens, Elanco has designed a small, vanilla and yeast fla-
voured, chewable lotilaner tablet, for oral administration
to cats (Credelio™, chewable tablets for cats).
The efficacy and safety of Credelio™ against fleas and
ticks in cats were validated in a number of pilot (undis-
closed data) and pivotal laboratory studies [11]. In a piv-
otal tolerance study in 8-week-old kittens lotilaner tablets
have been shown to be safe at doses up to 200 mg/kg for
monthly treatment over 3 months and up to 130 mg/kg
administered monthly for 8 months, respectively [12].
When administered with food, lotilaner is rapidly
absorbed, with peak blood concentrations occurring
within approximately 4 h, and has a half-life of approxi-
mately four weeks [13].
To provide confirmation of the efficacy of the minimum
recommended dose of 6 mg/kg lotilaner and to evaluate the
speed of kill throughout the month, two pivotal, GCP,
assessor-blinded, randomised, negative-controlled studies,
evaluated the efficacy and speed of kill of a single dose of
lotilaner (Credelio™ chewable tablets for cats), against weekly
experimental infestation with adult fleas, over 5 weeks.
Methods
Two pivotal efficacy studies were conducted at an Elanco
Animal Health laboratory in St-Aubin, Switzerland, in 
compliance with Swiss guidelines covering efficacy studies
with ectoparasiticides in cats and dogs, VICH GL9 Good
Clinical Practice Guidelines, EMEA/CVMP/EWP/005/
2000-Rev.2, and European Parliament Directive 2001/82/
EC [14–16].
Design
Both studies were performed in compliance with GCP qual-
ity standards and were blinded, randomized, parallel-group
and negative controlled.
Study 1 was a dose confirmation study with the object-
ive of confirming the efficacy of lotilaner tablets for cats
as close as possible to the minimum recommended dose
rate of 6 mg/kg, against adult fleas (Ctenocephalides
felis),  in experimentally infested cats. Sixteen cats were
randomized to two groups: one treatment group and
one negative control group of eight cats each. Efficacy
was evaluated 24 (± 1) h after treatment on day 0 (i.e.
on day 1, 48 h after flea infestation) and 24 (± 1) h after
each subsequent flea infestation (i.e. on days 8, 15, 22,
29 and 36).
The objective of Study 2 was to evaluate the speed of
kill of lotilaner dosed orally once, on day 0, at the mini-
mum recommended dose rate of 6 mg/kg against experi-
mental infestations with adult fleas (C. felis) in cats.
Thirty-two cats were randomized to four groups of eight
animals each: two treatment groups (Groups 2 and 4)
and two negative control groups (Groups 1 and 3). Effi-
cacy was measured 8 and 12 h after treatment and 8 and
12 h after each subsequent weekly flea infestation, until
the end of the study on day 35 (see Table 1 for details on
cat groups and time points).
A pre-dose infestation test was performed during the
acclimatization phase in order to evaluate the flea reten-
tion rate measured at 24 (± 1) h post-infestation. This
retention rate was used as a criterion for inclusion of the
cats into the study and for randomization.
Body weight was recorded three times, twice during
the acclimatization phase and then once at the end of
the study. Full physical examinations were performed at
the beginning of acclimatization and at the end of the
study. General health observations were performed daily
and additional clinical observations occurred at approxi-
mately 1 h, 6 h and 8 h post-treatment.

Animals
In order to obtain eight cats suitable for inclusion in
each study group, 60 healthy European domestic short
hair cats of both sexes (24 cats in the first study and 36
cats in the second study) from the St-Aubin cat colony,
with a minimum age of 12 months, with body weight
that allowed for administration of lotilaner at a mini-
mum dose of 6 mg/kg and as close as possible to this
target dose rate, were selected for acclimatization. These
cats had to be clinically healthy and with no pre-existing
skin lesions or known high allergic reactions to insect
bites. No other ectoparasiticide treatment had been
provided to them for at least 8 weeks (6 months for
isoxazolines) before the first infestation in these studies.
An infestation test (“pre-dose infestation test”) was per-
formed during the acclimatization phase (14 days before
start of the study) in order to evaluate the flea retention
rate measured at 24 (± 1) h post-infestation. Cats having a
flea retention rate of at least approximately 50% in the
acclimatization phase were considered eligible for inclu-
sion in the study. Any cats that developed important skin
lesions or had an allergic reaction to insect bites after the
pre-infestation test of the acclimatization phase and cats
considered difficult to manipulate were excluded from the
study. Following the acclimatization phase, 48 cats were
randomized in the studies (16 cats in Study 1 and 32 in
Study 2).  After discussion between the investigator and
the sponsor, three cats with flea retention rates slightly
lower than 50% (47–49%) were included in Study 1. Simi-
larly, one cat with a flea retention rate of 42% was in-
cluded in Study 2. These deviations were minor and did
not affect the study results. Any cats excluded from the
study were returned to the research site cat colony.
Cats were housed in rooms, each containing two pens,
with up to 8 cats per room and 4 cats per pen. In both
studies, cats were housed in individual cages from infes-
tations until the flea counts were completed. On some
days during acclimatization, cats were also individually
housed to be trained to consume their feeding portion
in 30 min. Additional individual housing was applied on
some acclimatization days for approximately 30 min or
1 h in Study 1 and 2, respectively, to train cats to wear
an Elizabethan collar.
Commercially available cat food was provided once
daily. To motivate cats to eat their whole food portion
within 30 min before treatment, each cat received only
half of their normal daily food portion the day prior to
treatment (i.e. day -1).  Cats were not force-fed. Fresh
drinking water from the communal water plant was avail-
able ad libitum.  Temperature and humidity were ad-
equately controlled for the duration of the study and a few
noted excursions were short and minor without any im-
pact on the study outcome. During the study, cat toys and
cat scratchers were available for animal welfare reasons. 
Randomisation and blinding
Randomization was carried out using SAS/STAT® soft-
ware (ver. 9.2; SAS Institute Inc.,  Cary, NC, USA) per
the site Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). Cats were
ranked ordered from highest to lowest flea pre-dose
counts and randomly allocated within blocks to treat-
ment groups. Block sizes of two cats were used in Study
1 and of four cats were used in Study 2. When two or
more cats had the same number of live fleas, the tie was
broken randomly. Cats within each treatment group
were randomly allocated to study rooms with each room
containing an equal representation of treated and con-
trol cats of the same counting time point as applicable
for the study. Blinding was accomplished by separation
of function. In Study 1, study personnel responsible for
general health observations, clinical observations, prepar-
ation of fleas, infestation with fleas, physical examination,
safety data review, animal weighing, and/or animal main-
tenance were blinded throughout the study. The sponsor’s
representative, monitor, quality assurance personnel, stat-
istician, and dispenser and assistant were unblinded. In
Study 2, blinding was guaranteed by a similar setting but
the safety data review was performed by the unblinded
sponsor’s representative.
Flea infestation and counting
Except for the pre-dose infestation test, in the intervals
between flea counting and next infestation, cats were
combed for 8–16 min in order to remove any fleas
remaining from the previous infestation.
A mixed flea strain of Swiss and Danish origin was
used in both studies. This strain was confirmed as a C.
felis strain based on morphological examination and
confirmation that the morphological features were iden-
tical to those described by Zentko & Richman [17].
Flea infestations were performed per the site SOP: 100
(± 5) unfed adult C. felis fleas (both sexes and aged 17–
21 days in Study 1 and 17–22 days in Study 2, were re-
leased on the back of the cats, from the neck to the cen-
tral part of the spine. For each infestation period (from
infestation until flea count was completed), cats wore an
individual Elizabethan collar. The Elizabethan collar was
removed prior to start combing the cats. Cats were not
sedated for flea infestation.
For flea counts, cats were first combed for 10 min. If
during the last 2 min, a minimum of three live fleas were
found, the animal was combed for two additional min,
for a maximum of 16 min combing time. During each
flea count, all fleas were removed, and live fleas killed in
70% ethanol solution and/or in a freezer (for at least 24
h);  all fleas were then disposed of in compliance with
local requirements. No cat needed to be sedated for the
flea counts.

In Study 1, fleas were classified as either live or dead.
In Study 2, the additional category “moribund” was
added. Fleas were considered live if they could maintain
an upright posture and if they could actively move
through hair removed from the animal during the comb-
ing procedure. A moribund flea was a flea that was lat-
erally recumbent, could not normally move through hair
or “right” itself when placed on a flat surface, but still
had leg movement or twitching. A dead flea was a com-
pletely immobile flea.
Treatment
Based on day -2 body weights, all cats in the treated
groups received a single oral administration of lotilaner
on day 0 at a minimum dose rate of 6 mg/kg and as
close as possible to this target dose rate; the treatment
was administered 30 ± 5 min following feeding. Two
tablet strengths (12 mg and 48 mg) were available. The
required number of tablets was placed over the tongue
of the cats, in the back of the oral cavity followed by ad-
ministration of 1–5 ml of water via a syringe to facilitate
swallowing. This was followed by a check of each cat’s
mouth to ensure that the full dose had been swallowed.
Mock dosing was performed for cats in the negative
control groups where the treatment administrator
opened and massaged the cat’s mouth followed by ad-
ministration of 1–5 ml of water via a syringe. In both
studies, no animal receiving lotilaner spat out the tab-
let(s) or vomited within 30 to 45 min following dosing.
Study assessments and statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS® (ver.
9.2.2, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The experimen-
tal unit was the individual animal. Descriptive statistics
(arithmetic and geometric mean, minimum, maximum,
standard deviation, coefficient of variation and median)
were calculated with respect to study groups separately
for flea counts and body weights.
Efficacy
Efficacy was defined as the ability of lotilaner to reduce
flea infestations on the cats at the specified time points
(24 h in Study 1 and 8 h and 12 h in Study 2) after treat-
ment following the infestation on day -2 and after each
post-treatment infestation. Efficacy calculation was based
on live flea counts; in Study 2, two different calculations
were performed, in which moribund fleas were consid-
ered as either live or dead. Efficacy was determined
based on the percent reduction in live adult flea counts
in the treated group compared with the negative control
(untreated) group for the same time point.
In Study 1, efficacy analyses were performed using the
intent-to-treat data set, which included all randomized
animals, i.e. animals that received lotilaner and the 
untreated animals. In Study 2, some cats could not be
infested on some days for animal welfare reasons, due to
reactions to flea bites, leading to smaller (but still suffi-
cient) group sizes. On each day, data were present only for
those animals which had been infested. Therefore, only
these animals were included in the statistical analysis for
efficacy (per protocol analysis).
Flea infestation was considered adequate at each time
point after lotilaner administration if the arithmetic
mean of the flea retention rate of the control animals
was at least approximately 50%. There were separate cal-
culations for each time point. Arithmetic and geometric
means of the flea counts were calculated. Efficacy using
geometric means was performed for information pur-
poses only. Efficacy was calculated as follows:
%Efficacy
Arithmetic=Geometric 
¼ 100 Â ð  Þ ð  Þ C À T =C
where C is the arithmetic/geometric mean number of
live fleas in the negative control group and T is the
arithmetic/geometric mean number of live fleas in the
treated group.
In order to avoid taking the log of zero, geometric
means were calculated after adding 1 to all flea counts,
and 1 was subtracted from the resulting geometric mean,
if any of the flea counts were zero. Log-transformed flea
counts were compared between groups in an analysis of
variance (ANOVA).  In Study 2, as the assumption of
normal distribution of log-transformed flea counts was
not valid, non-parametric methods were additionally
applied to compare the treated and negative control
groups (Mann-Whitney U-test).
Lotilaner was considered effective for the control of C.
felis at a given time point if infestation was adequate, if
there was a statistically significant difference between
flea counts of the treated group and the untreated group
(2-sided P < 0.05), and if the treated group had a calcu-
lated efficacy of ≥ 95% (live fleas) using the arithmetic
means.
Safety
Adverse events were coded according to VeDDRA SOC
and PT (Veterinary Dictionary for Drug Regulatory
Activities, System Organ Class, Preferred Term).  For
each SOC and PT, the number of animals showing the
respective sign was counted for untreated and treated
animals, and the number of adverse events with the
respective sign was calculated. Some of the adverse
events that occurred during group housing could not be
attributed to a specific cat but only to the set of four cats
in the same pen. These adverse events were summarized
separately, by pen rather than by cat. Full physical

examinations were performed at the beginning of
acclimatization and at the end of each study.
In Study 1, body weights were recorded on days -16,
-9, -2 and 37. In Study 2, body weights were recorded
on days -15, -9, -2 and 37 for Groups 1 and 2; and on
days -16, -10, -3 and 36 for Groups 3 and 4. Body weight
change was calculated as the change in weight from
baseline (weight closest to dosing was used as baseline
weight) to weight at the end of the study and was
analysed in the first study using an analysis of covariance
containing the model effects “Treatment Group” and
“Baseline”. In Study 2, this was analysed using an analysis
of variance (ANOVA) with the fixed effect of “Treatment
Group” and the random effects of “Block” and “Room”.

Results
In both studies, all cats in the lotilaner groups were
dosed according to the protocol instructions. Since Cre-
delio™ chewable tablets for cats are not divisible, animals
were dosed with one or more full tablet(s), for the dose
rate to be as close as possible to the target lotilaner dose
of 6 mg/kg. The dose ranged from 6.2 to 8.3 mg/kg and
from 6.5 to 8.1 mg/kg in Study 1 and 2, respectively.
Cats in the negative control groups (untreated) were
mock-dosed.
Efficacy
Adequacy of infestation
In both studies, there was an adequate flea infestation
rate of at least 50% in all the negative control groups at
each of the time points. In Study 1, the arithmetic mean
flea counts throughout the study were between 67.3–
85.4% in the control group. In Study 2, when moribund
fleas were considered live, they were between 79.6–
85.6% in the 8 h control group and between 69.6–86.9%
in the 12 h control group. 
Efficacy percentage
Study 1: Arithmetic and geometric mean flea numbers
in the lotilaner group were 0 at all time points, corre-
sponding to a calculated efficacy of 100% on all assess-
ment days. Differences in flea counts between treatment
groups were significant at all time points (Table 2 and
Fig. 1).
Study 2: When based on arithmetic mean and with
moribund fleas considered as live, at the 8 h time point,
the efficacy of lotilaner was 97.4% after treatment on day
0 and ≥ 97.7% after new subsequent infestations until
the end of the month; on day 35 it was 91.6% (Table 3
and Fig. 1).
Efficacy at 8 h post-treatment and post re-infestations
based on geometric means was similar and ranged from
98.3 to 99.9% from day 0 to day 28 and 94.5% on day 35.
Mean flea numbers and corresponding efficacy percent-
ages, along with comparison P-values by time point are
shown in Table 3.
In the same study, at the 12 h time point, when mori-
bund fleas were considered as live, efficacy ranged from
98.6 to 100% when based on arithmetic mean flea counts
(Table 4 and Fig. 1), and 99.3 to 100% when geometric
means were applied (Table 4).
For both the 8 h and 12 h assessment time points, dif-
ferences in flea counts between treatment groups were
significant on all study days.
When only live flea counts were used for efficacy
calculation, efficacy percentages for the 8 h assessment,
increased to 96.2–100% and 97.6–100% (based on arith-
metic and geometric means, respectively), while for the 12
h time point the corresponding ranges were 99.0–100%
and 99.6–100%.
Safety
All included cats remained in both studies until the end
of the animal phase. In Study 1, all adverse events (AEs)
reported (4 in treated cats and 1 in an untreated cat)
were considered as unrelated to the product: 4 of them
were skin-related and likely due to the repeated flea

infestation; one cat in the treated group had an episode
of vomiting on day 22. All cases were reported as mild,
there was no need to administer concomitant treatment
and all cats made a full recovery.
In Study 2, nineteen skin related adverse events were
reported in the untreated groups and fifteen in the
treated ones. All were attributed to the repeated flea
infestations.
A number of mild gastrointestinal observations (loose
stool, vomiting of hairball, and sporadic cases of blood
in faeces) were also reported: 64 in the untreated and 43
in the lotilaner-treated groups. The exact number of cats
affected by these adverse events could not be computed
due to the fact that most observations occurred during
group housing and were attributed to all animals in the
same pen. There were two serious adverse events (one
hotspot and one skin abscess) that occurred in untreated
animals which needed treatment with antibiotics and
corticosteroids. 
The ANOVA model revealed no statistically significant
differences in body weight change (from baseline to end
of the study) between the treated and untreated groups.
Discussion
These two studies demonstrated the efficacy of lotilaner
(Credelio™ chewable tablets for cats) against experimental
flea infestations as soon as 8 hours post-administration
and after subsequent infestations, for one month. Since
Credelio™ chewable tablets for cats are not divisible, ani-
mals were dosed with full tablets. The importance of a
highly efficacious and fast killing flea-product is linked to
the fact that, after infesting the host, fleas start feeding al-
most immediately and flea egg production begins within
24–36 h after the first blood meal has been taken [18, 19].
The main objectives of a flea control programme should
be to treat flea infestations fast enough to limit the expos-
ure of the animal to the flea salivary antigens and to pos-
sible pathogens, thus reducing the risk of FAD (flea allergy

dermatitis), and of vector-borne diseases. In addition, the
use of a fast flea-killing product allows the prevention of
flea egg production and contributes to the depletion of the
parasite stages in the cat’s environment.
The results of the two studies show that efficacy, start-
ing 8 hours post-treatment and weekly re-infestations in-
creases with time reaching 100% at 24 hours. In Study 2,
two different approaches for the calculation of efficacy
were applied, with moribund fleas being considered as
live or dead. At the time the study was performed, the
approach of the EU and USA regulators concerning the
classification of the moribund fleas seemed to be chan-
ging, and the consensus position adopted was to con-
sider these fleas as live, therefore relevant for efficacy
calculation. For this reason, the primary efficacy object-
ive in Study 2 included moribund fleas in the calcula-
tion. Still, the authors considered the investigation of
efficacy with moribund fleas disregarded, as possibly
providing a deeper understanding of the killing activity
of the product.
At the 8 h time point, higher efficacy percentages were
obtained when moribund fleas were excluded from the
calculation, while at 12 h, the difference between the
two calculations was less prominent. This comparison,
together with the observation that, in the control
groups, mean live flea counts were identical when mori-
bund fleas were included in the counts or disregarded,
suggest that moribund fleas had been affected by lotila-
ner but the early 8 h time point had not allowed yet for
their complete death.
The fast and sustained speed of kill of Credelio™ is con-
sistent with pharmacokinetic data, showing that, following
oral administration in fed cats, lotilaner is readily
absorbed, with peak blood concentrations reached within
four hours and a terminal half-life of about 4 weeks [13].
The duration of efficacy of Credelio™ until the end of
the month, is a guarantee for both cat owners and veter-
inarians that new flea infestations will be knocked-down
very rapidly, helping preventing the onset or the 
re-appearance of the signs of FAD in cats with a
confirmed diagnosis of FAD. By quickly killing newly
infesting fleas before they can lay eggs, monthly treat-
ments will break the flea life-cycle in the cat environment
and will prevent environmental flea contamination elimin-
ating the need for additional environmental control prod-
ucts, e.g. insect growth regulators. The main focus of
these studies was the efficacy evaluation of Credelio™;
therefore neither haematological nor biochemical analyses
were performed. Data from the target animal safety study
[12], in which the product was administered orally every 4
weeks for 8 months, at doses up to 130 mg/kg lotilaner, in
healthy kittens, 8-week-old at study start, showed no clin-
ically relevant treatment-related effects on clinical path-
ology parameters and no treatment-related effects on food
consumption, ophthalmoscopic, physical/neurological and
organ macroscopic and microscopic examinations.
These observations, together with the absence of
product-related adverse events in the efficacy studies
presented here, and the overall higher rate of skin and
gastrointestinal observations in control animals, confirm
that Credelio™ is well tolerated in cats and kittens. The
clinical safety and the efficacy of the product against
fleas and clinical signs of FAD, were further confirmed
in an European, well controlled, randomized pivotal field
study [20], assessing the efficacy of Credelio™ when ad-
ministered to privately-owned cats, naturally infested
with fleas, according to the proposed commercial label.
In this study, the efficacy and safety of lotilaner were
compared to those of a fipronil/(S)-methoprene spot-on.
The overall flea reduction for the study period was 97.7% in
cats treated with lotilaner compared with a reduction of
47.4% for cats treated with fipronil/(S)-methoprene. Crede-
lio™ superiority to the control product was demonstrated at
all time-points and for the entire study period (P < 0.0001).
At every post-administration evaluation, at least 81% of
lotilaner-treated cats were flea-free as opposed to 25% in
the fipronil/(S)-methoprene group. Credelio™ improved or
eliminated clinical signs of FAD, including pruritus.
Page 8
Cavalleri et al. Parasites & Vectors (2018) 11:408  Page 8 of 9
In a similar European field study, focussing on safety
and efficacy against ticks, lotilaner was compared to a
fipronil spot-on. The mean percent efficacy over all
post-enrolment visits was 99.6% and 96.4% (lotilaner and
fipronil group, respectively) (P < 0.0001). Lotilaner was
superior to fipronil for efficacy averaged over all time
points (P < 0.0001) and on individual assessment days
(day 14 to 70, P < 0.0394); it was non-inferior to fipronil
on the other days.
In the two field studies, Credelio™ was well tolerated
and Fisher’s exact test showed that the number of cats af-
fected by adverse events was not significantly different be-
tween the two treatment groups for each of the signs.
Historically, the availability of products that treat cats
for both ticks and fleas has been quite limited. Fipronil
has been available as a topical for many years in prod-
ucts like Frontline® Combo and Broadline® (Merial) [21,
22]. A collar combining imidacloprid and flumethrin (Ser-
esto®) is also currently available in many markets [23]. More
recently, Bravecto® spot-on solution (fluralaner; MSD/
Merck) and Stronghold® Plus (selamectin/sarolaner; Zoetis),
both of which contain topical isoxazolines, were registered
for cats [8, 9]. Credelio™ (lotilaner) represents both the first
oral tick and flea product as well as the first oral isoxazoline
registered for cats.
Conclusions
Lotilaner administered orally at a minimum dose rate of 6
mg/kg to cats was effective as early as 8 hours
post-administration and subsequent new re-infestations for
at least one month, against experimental infestations of
adult C. felis. Eight hours after dosing and after new infesta-
tions, efficacy was at least 97.4%, increasing to 98.6% at 12
hours and reaching 100% at 24 hours, through one-month
post-administration. By quickly killing pre-existing and
newly infesting fleas, lotilaner has the potential to contrib-
ute to the reduction of flea-borne pathogens transmission,
the development and re-occurrence of FAD and breaking
the flea life-cycle in the cat environment. Credelio™ was
well-tolerated with no product-related adverse events
recorded.
