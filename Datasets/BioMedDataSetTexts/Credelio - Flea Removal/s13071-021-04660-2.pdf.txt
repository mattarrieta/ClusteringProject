Efficacy of lotilaner (Credelio™)
against experimentally induced infestations
of the adult cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis,
and flea eggs following oral administration
to cats
Tandy Paarlberg1*, Daniela Karadzovska2 and Rainer Helbig3
Abstract 
Background: Credelio™ (lotilaner; Elanco) is indicated for the treatment of flea and tick infestations on cats at a
recommended lotilaner dose rate of 6–24 mg/kg. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of lotilaner following
a single oral administration to cats for the treatment and prevention of adult Ctenocephalides felis fleas and flea egg
production under laboratory conditions.
Methods:  Two treatment groups of ten cats each were used in this study. One group was treated with lotilaner at a
dose rate of 6−9 mg/kg on Day 0 and the other group served as the control group. Each cat was infested with 100
unfed adult fleas on days –1, 6, 13, 20 and 29. At 24 h post-treatment or post-infestation, each cat was combed to
remove and count adult live fleas. At each time point, flea eggs were also collected and counted from under each cat
cage.
Results:  Following a single oral administration of lotilaner at a minimum dose rate of 6 mg/kg (range 6.00−8.57 mg/
kg), the lotilaner group displayed 100%, 100%, 99.9%, 99.9% and 99.8% efficacy against adult live flea counts as
compared to the control group on Days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 30, respectively. At each time point, adult flea counts from the
lotilaner-treated cats were significantly lower (P < 0.0001) than from the control group. A mean flea egg count of 22.6
in the lotilaner-treated cats (compared to 441.7 in the control animals) was observed 24 h post-treatment. No eggs
were present from any of the treated cats on Days 7, 14 and 30 and a single egg was detected on a single treated cat
on Day 21. One adverse event (regurgitated food) was observed during the study in one treated cat approximately
1 h after dosing.
Conclusions:  Lotilaner was well tolerated; only one adverse event was observed in the treated group. Virtually all
adult fleas were killed within 24 h post-treatment or post-infestation in cats treated with a single dose of lotilaner as
compared to the control group, thus significantly reducing the number of flea eggs being produced for 30 days after
treatment.

Background
The cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) is an extremely com-
mon parasite infesting the domestic cat. It is considered
an important vector and contributing factor in diseases
affecting cats (flea allergy dermatitis, Dipylidium cani-
num infestations) and humans (flea bite allergy) [1, 2].
Cat flea infestations in the home environment typi-
cally begin when pets carry fleas indoors. Under favora-
ble conditions, a female cat flea can produce an average
of 20–30 eggs per day during a lifespan of 3–4 weeks [3].
As cat fleas rarely leave their host voluntarily, on-host
flea control becomes an important element of treatment; 
another is prevention of flea reproduction. The female cat
fleas begin laying their eggs within 24 to 36 h of acquir-
ing a host and feeding [2]; therefore, products providing
a rapid speed of kill that eliminate female fleas prior to
production of eggs are highly desirable.
There are numerous safe and effective host-targeted
flea control agents available for cats as either topi-
cal (dinotefuran, fipronil, imidacloprid, indoxacarb, 
selamectin, spinetoram) or oral (spinosad, nitenpyram) 
applications [4], some of which are also effective against
ticks. Most recently, a new class of parasiticides, the
isoxazolines, has been introduced to the market with
both topical and oral formulations. Lotilaner (Crede-
lio™; Elanco) is the first of the isoxazolines to be regis-
tered as an oral product for cats that treats flea and tick
infestations [5].  Other isoxazolines such as fluralaner
(Bravecto® spot-on solution MSD/Merck), and sarolaner
in combination with selamectin (Stronghold® Plus/
Revolution® Plus; Zoetis) have been approved as topical
spot-on applications.
The safety and efficacy of lotilaner flavored chewable
tablets for cats (Credelio™, Elanco) against fleas (C. felis)
and ticks (Ixodes ricinus) for 1 month, following oral
administration at the minimum dose rate of 6.0 mg/kg, 
have been demonstrated in multiple pivotal laboratory
studies [6, 7]. Safety was further demonstrated in a piv-
otal target animal safety study in 8-week-old kittens that
showed lotilaner tablets to be safe at doses up to 130 mg
lotilaner/kg of body weight when administered every
4 weeks for 8 months [8].
In this study, the efficacy against adult fleas but also egg
production and the safety of lotilaner administered once, 
at the minimum dose rate (6.0 mg/kg body weight), to
cats experimentally infested with adult fleas under labo-
ratory conditions was evaluated.
Methods
This study was a blinded, randomized, negative con-
trolled laboratory study. Blinding of the study was
achieved through the separation of functions; personnel 
conducting observations, performing flea infestations
and counts were blinded to treatment allocation.
Animals
Twenty purpose-bred cats aged between 10 and
149 months were used in this study. Cats were in
good health at the start of the acclimation phase, 
weighed ≥ 2.7 kg and had not been treated with an
ectoparasiticide for a least 8 weeks prior to the start of
the study (6 months prior for isoxazoline compounds).
Cats wore an Elizabethan collar (to avoid self-grooming
and resulting flea removal) during each of the infesta-
tion periods and were housed in individual cages for
the duration of the study. Within each cage, cats were
maintained on a raised floor, so eggs and debris dropped
directly onto butcher paper placed on the stainless steel
cage floors at the beginning of each collection period. 
Cats were observed for general health at least once daily
throughout the study and were fed an appropriate main-
tenance ration of a commercial cat food. On the day of
dosing, commercial canned food was used to encourage
food consumption. Water was available ad libitum.
Animal selection and randomization
On Day –7, all cats were infested with 100 unfed adult
fleas (C. felis; approximately 50% male and 50% female) 
of a laboratory bred colony (USA strain). On Day –6, flea
comb counts were performed to assess the susceptibility
of each cat to maintaining experimental infestations and
for random allocation of cats to treatment groups. Flea
combing using a fine-toothed comb was completed in
accordance to the laboratory’s standard operating proce-
dure. The 20 cats that met the inclusion criteria, none of
the exclusion criteria and had the highest pre-treatment
live adult flea counts were used in this study. To ensure
the treatment groups were balanced with respect to flea
retention, pre-treatment live adult C. felis infestation lev-
els were used as the blocking factor. Cats were ranked in
order of live flea count from highest to lowest. Within
each block, each treatment was represented once and
randomly rearranged before cats were assigned. There
were ten blocks of two cats defined.
Treatments
On the day of treatment, each cat was offered approxi-
mately 1/3 of the manufacturer’s recommended daily
amount of food approximately 30 min prior to treatment. 
Two cats did not consume one-third of their daily ration
and were treated with lotilaner.
Single or multiple combinations of lotilaner tablet sizes
were used to achieve a lotilaner dose rate of 6−9 mg/kg
corresponding to the lower end of the registered dose
Page 3
Paarlberg   et al. Parasites Vectors (2021) 14:139  Page 3 of 6
rate of 6–24 mg/kg on Day 0 post-feeding. Administra-
tion of the tablets was immediately followed by a check
of each cat’s mouth to ensure the full dose had been swal-
lowed. A standard dose of tap water (approximately 5 ml) 
was given via syringe after the administration of each
tablet to facilitate swallowing.
Each cat in the control group was “mock dosed” on Day
0. Mock dosing involved opening the cat’s mouth and
administering a standard volume of tap water (approxi-
mately 5 ml) with a syringe. Mock dosing facilitated cal-
culating times for clinical observations post-treatment
and for adult flea and flea egg counts on Day 1.
Cats were observed following treatment for any adverse
events. Following the 1-h post-dosing observations, each
cat was offered their remaining portion of their standard
daily maintenance diet.
Efficacy evaluations
On Days –1, 6, 13, 20 and 29 each cat was infested with
approximately 100 unfed adult fleas (C. felis) of a labo-
ratory bred colony (USA strain from Young Veterinary
Research Services). All cats were infested as per the labo-
ratory’s standard operating procedure.
Cats were maintained on a raised floor, so eggs and
debris dropped directly onto butcher paper cover-
ing the stainless steel cage floor. On Day 0, before cats
were removed from cages to be dosed, their hair coat
was roughed to help remove eggs that had already been
laid. During dosing of cats, the floor for each animal was
swept to remove and dispose of existing eggs and debris. 
Flea egg collections and adult flea counts were per-
formed on Days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 30 at 24 h post-treatment
or post-infestation. During combing sessions for fleas, 
only the number of live fleas on each cat was included in
the count. A flea exhibiting normal behavior or with any
response to external stimuli was considered live.
Flea eggs were swept and collected from the bottom of
each cat cage. Flea eggs were separated from each cat’s
debris (e.g. hair, food, etc.) before counting.
The statistician prepared a list for each counting day
that defined the random order (based on cage number) in
which both adult flea and flea egg counts was performed. 
Additionally, to minimize bias, cats were randomized to
cages such that a control and treated cat may have been
housed next to each other (Fig. 1).
Data analysis
Efficacy analyses were performed twice; one analysis on
the intent-to-treat population (including all randomized
animals) and another analysis on the per-protocol pop-
ulation (excluding the two cats that did not consume
one-third of their daily ration).  There were no nota-
ble differences in both; therefore, only the results of the
intent-to-treat population are reported here. All analyses
were performed using SAS/STAT® software (version 9.2, 
SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Percent efficacy of lotilaner with respect to the
untreated control group was calculated using the for-
mula:100 ∗ ((C − T)/C)where C arithmetic mean number

mean number of adult live fleas in the lotilaner-treated
group for each time point.
Comparisons of live flea counts between treat-
ment groups were tested using the two-sided 5% sig-
nificance level. A mixed model analysis was used to
analyze the logarithm-transformed counts + 1 by
time point, with treatment group as a fixed effect and
block as a random effect. In addition, a non-paramet-
ric comparison between treatment groups was per-
formed (Mann-Whitney U test).  Comparisons of flea
egg counts between treatment groups were also tested
using the two-sided 5% significance level.
Results
All cats included in the study demonstrated adequate
pre-treatment live flea retention on day –6 with counts
ranging from 65 to 97 fleas/cat in the control group and
64−94 in the lotilaner-treated group. Adequate flea infes-
tations were obtained in all ten cats in the control group
at each post-treatment evaluation time point with aver-
age (arithmetic mean) infestation rates ranging from 84.3
to 90.6% (Table 1).
Cats in the lotilaner treatment group received a dose
in the range of 6.00–8.57 mg/kg (Table 2). One cat in the
lotilaner-treated group was observed to have regurgi-
tated food approximately 1 h after dosing. This was the
only adverse event observed during the study. This cat
was also one of the two cats that did not consume 1/3 of
their daily ration prior to treatment.
On Days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 30, in the intent-to-treat anal-
ysis the lotilaner group exhibited 100%,  100%,  99.9%,
99.9% and 99.8% effectiveness against fleas, respectively, 
(Table 3).  Furthermore, the mean live flea counts of 
treated and untreated groups were significantly different
(P < 0.0001),  with lower counts in the lotilaner-treated
group at each time point (Table 3). The individual flea
counts for the two cats that did not consume 1/3 of their
ration prior to treatment were zero on Days 1, 7, 14 and
21. On Day 30, one cat had zero fleas and the other had
two.
For the prevention of egg laying, efficacy can be con-
cluded for all days. On Day 1, egg counts varied between
1 and 46 (mean 22.6) in the treated cats (intent-to-treat
analysis; Table 4) and between 8 and 46 (mean 23.6) 
in the per-protocol analysis, compared to 205 to 677
(mean 441.7) in the control animals. On Days 7, 14 and
30, there were no eggs present on any of the treated
cats. On Day 21, a single egg was detected on a single
treated cat. The individual flea egg counts for the two
cats that did not consume 1/3 of their ration prior to
treatment were zero on Days 7, 14, 21 and 30. Flea eggs
were noted for both cats on Day 1 (36 on one cat and 1
on the other).
Throughout the study, egg counts in the control group
ranged from 0 to 677, with at least six cats having counts
in double digits on each counting date. Egg counts in the
control group can therefore be considered adequate.
Discussion
Without effective treatment, cats in a flea-infested envi-
ronment would continuously be re-infested by new
fleas from their environment. These fleas would seed
the environment with eggs after feeding on their host
and the flea life cycle would continue and contribute
to the flea burden until stopped. Therefore, an essen-
tial element in flea control is treatment of the host,

including treating all susceptible pets in a household, 
regularly and with a fast-acting, efficacious product to
ensure flea egg production is halted. In this study, adult
flea efficacy remained ≥ 99.8% 24 h after each infesta-
tion time point, demonstrating that one monthly treat-
ment with lotilaner at the dose range of 6–9 mg/kg
remains effective at eliminating repeated flea infesta-
tions for 30 days.
At 24 h post-treatment with lotilaner, adult flea effi-
cacy was 100%. A similar result was seen at 24 h post-
treatment in a speed of kill study using a mixed flea strain
of Swiss and Danish origin [6]. In separate speed of kill
study using the same mixed flea strain, lotilaner at 6 mg/
kg was shown to be effective at killing fleas as early as 8 h
post treatment (≥ 97.4%) and 100% effective within 24 h
following subsequent weekly infestations of adult C. felis 
through 35 days post treatment [6]. Lotilaner’s sustained
speed of kill is consistent with its pharmacokinetic pro-
file, which shows following oral administration in fed
cats, it is readily absorbed, with a half-life of > 4 weeks
[9].  This same study showed that administration with
food enhanced the absorption of lotilaner, providing close
to 100% oral bioavailability, and reduced the inter-indi-
vidual variability. For this reason, the statistical analysis

was performed twice to assess the impact of the two cats
from the lotilaner-treated group that did not consume
one-third of their daily ration. One analysis included all
randomized animals (the intent-to-treat population) and
the other analysis excluded the two mentioned cats (the
per-protocol population). The results (not shown here) 
indicate that there was no notable difference between the
two analyses; hence, the deviation had no impact on the
study outcome. Furthermore, the individual flea and egg
counts for the two cats that did not consume 1/3 of their
daily ration (one which also regurgitated food approxi-
mately 1 h after dosing) indicated lotilaner was effica-
cious in these animals.
Within 24 h of lotilaner administration, egg produc-
tion was drastically impaired with a group mean of 22.6
eggs compared to a mean of 441.7 in the control cats. 
Flea eggs present on Day 1 are not considered a lack of
efficacy since the cats were infested with fleas on Day –1
(thus fleas were on the cats for 48 h before egg count, 
which included 24 h before treatment). These most likely
were already in production in the female fleas at the time

of treatment as the first flea infestation was applied 24 h
before dosing, giving the fleas time to feed and lay eggs
[4].
There were no eggs present on any of the treated cats
on Days 7, 14 and 30, and one single egg was found on
one treated cat on Day 21. Although this may have been
the result of the randomized housing, where control and
treated cats were housed side by side, the egg counts in
the treated group can be considered essentially zero at
the re-infestation time points.
One adverse event was observed in this study, with one
cat in the lotilaner-treated group having regurgitated
food approximately 1 h after dosing. Despite this event, 
lotilaner was seen to be effective in this cat as live flea
counts were zero on Days 1, 7, 14 and 21; two fleas were
counted on Day 30. Similarly, egg counts for this cat were
36 on Day 1 and zero for all subsequent time points. As
this was a single event, administration of lotilaner tab-
lets to cats is considered well tolerated and safe. Further-
more, data from the target animal safety study, in which
the product was administered orally every 4 weeks for
8 months, at doses up to 130 mg/kg lotilaner, in healthy
kittens, 8 weeks old at study start, showed no clinically
relevant treatment-related effects on clinical and clinical
pathology parameters [8]. The safety and efficacy of loti-
laner administration were further demonstrated in two
field trials (EU and USA), in which an improvement or
elimination of clinical signs of flea allergic dermatitis was
also observed [10].
Conclusions
Following a single oral administration of lotilaner (Cre-
delio™) at a dose of 6–9 mg/kg to experimentally infested
cats, a reduction ≥ 99.8% of adult fleas at 24 h post-
treatment or post-infestation was seen for 30 days. This
significant reduction impacted the egg production for
the 30 days following treatment. Based on these results, 
lotilaner provides cats relief of fleas and, by killing fleas
before they can lay eggs, depletes the flea stages in the
cat’s environment.
