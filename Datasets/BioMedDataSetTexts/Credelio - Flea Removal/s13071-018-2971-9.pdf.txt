Abstract
Background: Lotilaner is a new isoxazoline developed as an oral ectoparasiticide for cats and dogs. Its safety, rapid
killing onset of action and sustained speed of fleas and ticks kill for a minimum of one month after administration,
were demonstrated in a number of laboratory studies in cats.
This study was performed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of lotilaner flavored chewable tablets for cats
(Credelio™, Elanco) in controlling fleas under field conditions in European countries.
Methods: Seventeen veterinary practices in France and Spain, located in high flea prevalence regions, participated
in the study. Households with a maximum of three cats and two dogs were randomized 2:1 to a lotilaner
(minimum dose rate 6 mg/kg) or a topical fipronil/(S)-methoprene combination (Frontline Combo® Spot-on Cats,
Merial) group (administered according to label). In each household, efficacy against fleas and flea allergy dermatitis
(FAD) signs were assessed in one primary cat (bearing a minimum of five fleas on Day 0) while safety was
evaluated in all cats. There were 121 households included in the lotilaner and 61 in the fipronil/(S)-methoprene
groups, respectively. Treatments were administered by the cats’ owners on Day 0. Flea counts and FAD assessments
were made on Days 0, 14, and 28. Efficacy calculations were based on geometric mean percent reductions of live
flea counts versus baseline pre-treatment counts.
Results: Lotilaner efficacy was 97.2 and 98.1% on Days 14 and 28, respectively. Corresponding efficacy for fipronil/
(S)-methoprene was 48.3 and 46.4%. Lotilaner was superior to fipronil/(S)-methoprene at all post-Day 0 assessments
and over the whole study period (P < 0.0001). At every post-administration evaluation, at least 81% of lotilaner-treated
cats were flea-free as opposed to 25% in the fipronil/(S)-methoprene group. Lotilaner improved or eliminated clinical
signs of FAD, including pruritus. Both products were well tolerated.
Conclusions: Under field conditions in Europe, lotilaner flavored chewable tablets for cats displayed an efficacy against
fleas higher than 97%; clinical signs of FAD were improved or eliminated. Lotilaner tablets were safe and provided
superior flea control to fipronil/(S)-methoprene.

Background
The isoxazoline class of compounds are the newest para-
siticides marketed for companion animals. These agents
differ from other historical parasiticide agents e.g. topic-
ally administered compounds, with a new mode of ac-
tion [1]. Lotilaner, a pure enantiomer of the isoxazoline
class, is the newest compound approved for the treat-
ment of flea and tick infestations in dogs (Credelio™
chewable tablets for dogs; Elanco Europe Ltd.,  Green-
field, IN, USA) [2]. This broad-spectrum parasiticide is a
potent inhibitor of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-gated
chloride channels, resulting in rapid death of ticks and
fleas, after oral administration to dogs [3–5].
Other isoxazolines previously approved for the treat-
ment of flea and tick infestations in dogs since 2014 are
afoxolaner, fluralaner and sarolaner. These compounds
are available as oral and topical (fluralaner only) formu-
lations. Fluralaner is the first isoxazoline that was ap-
proved in cats, formulated as a solution for topical
application (Bravecto® spot-on solution for cats; Merck
Animal Health, Madison, NJ, USA) [6]. Currently there
is no isoxazoline-containing ectoparasiticide product for
oral administration available for the treatment of fleas
and tick infestations in cats.
During a market research conducted as part of the de-
velopment of lotilaner for cats (unpublished data),  pet
owners expressed specific, negative emotions related to
the administration of topical spot-on products to cats
and the disruption that occurs in the bond between the
owner and their cat when topical products are applied.
Many of these owners responded positively to the idea
of an easy-to-give flavoured, oral tick and flea option for
cats. A small, flavoured, cat-friendly, oral tablet would,
therefore, be a welcomed novel product filling the gap in
tick and flea control in cats.
In a number of pivotal laboratory studies, the safety
and the efficacy of lotilaner flavored chewable tablets for
cats (Credelio™, Elanco) against fleas (C. felis) and ticks
(Ixodes ricinus) for 1 month, following oral administra-
tion at the minimum dose rate of 6.0 mg/kg, was dem-
onstrated [7, 8].
A pivotal tolerance study in 8-week-old kittens had
shown lotilaner tablets to be safe at doses up to 130 mg
lotilaner/kg (high dose of 130 mg/kg; actual high dose
levels of 131.24 mg/kg for males and 131.30 mg/kg, re-
spectively for females) for monthly treatment over 8
months [9].
In this study, the authors evaluated the efficacy and
safety of lotilaner administered once, at the dose rates
intended for the marketed product (6.0 to 22.9 mg/kg
body weight), to cats naturally infested with fleas under
field conditions in Europe. A fipronil/(S)-methoprene
combination (Frontline Combo® Spot-on Cats, Merial,
Lyon, France) was used as the positive control. The 
effect of the product on clinical signs associated with flea
allergy dermatitis (FAD) was also evaluated.
Methods
This assessor-blinded, randomized, positive-controlled,
non-inferiority, multicentre field trial was conducted
according to the study authorizations issued by the
Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios
(Spanish regulatory authorities) and the Agence Française
de Sécurité Sanitaire des aliments (AFSSA) (French regula-
tory authorities),  and in compliance with the applicable
regulatory guidelines, which were current at the time the
study was performed [10–15].
Animals
Seventeen veterinary practices in France and Spain par-
ticipated in the study. Sites were selected in areas with a
known high prevalence of fleas. Households with a max-
imum of three cats and two dogs were eligible to partici-
pate, provided that cats and dogs did not regularly or
frequently contact each other or share resting places, for
the whole duration of the study.
Cats aged ≥ 8 weeks and weighing ≥ 1 kg were eligible
for enrolment. At least one cat from each household
(primary cat) had to be found to be infested with ≥ 5
fleas prior to treatment. All cats were required to be
clinically healthy or with conditions judged not to inter-
fere with the study by the study veterinarian. Inclusion
of cats showing signs of FAD was encouraged.
Cats with known hypersensitivity to the active ingredi-
ents and/or excipients of the investigational veterinary
product: Credelio™ (lotilaner chewable tablets for cats,
Elanco, Greenfield, IN, USA) or control product (Frontline
Combo® Spot-on Cat, Merial, Duluth, Georgia) were not
eligible for inclusion in the study. Pre-treatments with
other ectoparasiticide compounds, pregnancy or lactation
were criteria that further excluded cats, as well as planned
routine surgical procedures, until cats fully recovered
from any intervention and no influence on the study pro-
cedures was expected. Other exclusion criteria were plans
for the animals to be used for breeding within 4 months
of treatment, convalescence from any serious conditions,
pre-existing medical and/or surgical conditions other than
flea infestation and FAD (unless such conditions did not
interfere with the suitability for the study treatments ad-
ministration, were mild or chronic, stable and under
control, according to the judgment of the examining vet-
erinarian). During the study, animals could be withdrawn
due to concomitant disease, death or euthanasia, or ser-
ious adverse events (SAEs) not compatible with the study.
Early withdrawal could also result from non-compliance
with the protocol, owner decision, or pre-termination of
the study as decided by the sponsor.

All animals stayed with their owners throughout the
study. The participating households were not permitted
to use any environmental treatments to control flea in-
festations during this period. All animals were provided
with food and water per the owners’ usual practices.
Randomisation and treatment
At each site, cats were randomised per household in the
sequence of inclusion according to the random treat-
ment allocation plan. All cats from the same household
were randomized to the same treatment. The random
treatment allocation plan was created using a block de-
sign and a 2:1 ratio (lotilaner:fipronil/(S)-methoprene).
The target number of enrolled subjects for efficacy ana-
lysis (primary cats) was 180, divided 2:1 between
lotilaner-treated subjects and fipronil/(S)-methoprene-
treated subjects. In each household, there could be one
primary cat only; any other cats (up to two) in the same
household were supplementary cats, treated with the
same product as the primary cat but only assessed
for safety.
Treatment was administered once, on Day 0 of the
study by the animals’ owners. All animals in Group 1 re-
ceived Credelio™ and all animals in Group 2 received
Frontline Combo® Spot-on Cat. Credelio™ was adminis-
tered orally within 30 min following feeding. The tablets
(strengths: 12 or 48 mg lotilaner) were administered
based on each cat’s individual body weight to achieve a
minimum dose rate of 6.0 mg/kg and a maximum of
22.9 mg/kg. Frontline Combo® Spot-on Cat (fipronil
50 mg/(S)-methoprene 60 mg) was administered topically
per the manufacturer’s product label, applied as a sin-
gle 0.5 ml pipette regardless of body weight. Dogs
(maximum of two per household) and other animals
in the household posing a risk of flea transmission to
cats were to be treated with a suitable oral ectopara-
siticide efficacious against fleas.
Study assessments
This study evaluated the efficacy against fleas and safety
of lotilaner chewable tablets compared with Frontline
Combo® Spot-on Cats, both administered once, to cats
naturally infested with fleas. The effect of the product
on clinical signs associated with FAD was also evaluated.
All efficacy analyses were performed for the primary cats
whereas safety analyses were performed for all cats en-
rolled in the study.
The primary efficacy criterion was the average efficacy
of lotilaner compared with fipronil/(S)-methoprene over
the entire treatment period, as based on flea counts for
each visit compared with baseline flea counts, averaged
on all visits, in a non-inferiority test. The secondary effi-
cacy criteria were efficacy of the lotilaner compared with
the control product for each visit, based again on the 
comparison between post-treatment and baseline flea
counts, and the assessment of FAD signs for primary
cats with FAD on Day 0. All efficacy analyses were per-
formed on 14 (± 2) and 28 (± 2) days post-treatment.
A full body flea count was performed for each cat with
a flea comb per the procedure defined in the protocol.
Each cat was combed for at least 10 min, and combing
continued for another 5 min after the last flea was
found. In the event that more than 100 fleas were
counted and the counting was not finished, the total
number of fleas was recorded as > 100. All cats (primary
and secondary) were assessed for safety based on health
observations for 28 (± 2) days post-treatment. In addition,
primary cats with clinical signs of FAD were assessed for
signs of FAD on Days 0, 14 (± 2), and 28 (± 2). FAD signs
(alopecia, crusts, erythema, hyperpigmentation, miliary
dermatitis, eosinophilic granuloma, eosinophilic plaque,
eosinophilic ulcer, papules, pruritus and scales) were clas-
sified as absent, mild, moderate, or severe and assigned a
score from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) by the Investigator. For
the sign “pruritus”, the scoring was done as follows: ab-
sent, no scratching; mild, occasionally scratching; moder-
ate, frequently scratching and/or biting itself; and severe,
intense scratching/biting itself. Animals were observed for
AEs (adverse events) for the whole duration of the study.
The environmental pressure of flea infestation at the
sites where the trial was conducted was also evaluated
throughout the study, based on the estimated overall
number of animals (cats and dogs) presented in the vet-
erinary practice or clinic diagnosed with a flea infest-
ation as well as the estimated number of products
supplied for flea prophylaxis and/or treatment in the last
7 days prior to the study visit of a cat.
Statistical analyses
All study animals were divided into the following three
analysis sets: intent-to-treat (ITT) efficacy population,
comprising all subjects that were randomized to a
treatment and that presented with ≥ 5 fleas at inclusion
(one cat per household, primary cat); per protocol (PP)
efficacy population, comprising subjects (primary cat)
without major protocol deviations; safety population,
comprising all subjects that were randomized to a treat-
ment and received one dose of lotilaner or the fipronil/
(S)-methoprene (primary and supplementary cats).
The Clinsight® Electronic Data Capture System was
used for data collection. All calculations were performed
using SAS® version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc.,  Cary, NC,
USA).  The statistical hypotheses were tested on a
2-sided level of significance of 0.05. P-values ≤ 0.05 were
considered significant.
For the demographics and related variables such as
sex, age, body weight, breed, hair length, and the time
animal spends indoor/outdoor, summary statistics
Page 4

and/or frequencies were calculated and the two groups
were compared with a non-parametric test (Kruskal-
Wallis, Mann-Whitney, or Fisher’s exact test, depend-
ing on the parameter).
Efficacy endpoints were assessed in the two efficacy
populations (ITT and PP). Percent efficacy was defined
in relation to baseline values, i.e.
% Efficacy ¼ 100 Â ð  Þ Flea count day 0 À Flea count actual day
=ð  Þ Flea count day 0
Flea counts recorded as “higher than 100”  were
assigned a nominative value of 101 for the purposes of
statistical analysis. Flea counts and reduction of flea
counts versus baseline were analysed statistically. Sum-
mary statistics including arithmetic and geometric mean,
minimum, maximum, and median were provided for all
parameters of interest. Treatment groups were com-
pared by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) methods, on
original scale or after possible log-transformation. To
avoid taking the log of zero, one (1) was added to all flea
counts before log-transformation. In the ANCOVA, the
number of cats per household was used as a covariate.
Non-inferiority was claimed when the 2-sided 95% confi-
dence interval (CI) for the ratio of flea counts for lotila-
ner, divided by the same value for Frontline Combo®
Spot-on Cats, was within the interval [0, 1/0.80] or [0,
1.25]. This indicated that the results showed (with 97.5%
confidence) that flea counts with lotilaner were not
higher than flea counts with Frontline Combo® Spot-on
Cats, up to a non-inferiority margin of 20%.
Safety endpoints were assessed in the safety population
on Days 0, 14 (± 2 days; primary cats only) and Day 28
(± 2 days; all animals). The cats were observed for AEs,
SAEs, and changes in body weight. Summary statistics
including arithmetic and geometric means, minimum,
maximum, and median were calculated for all parameters
of interest. Treatment groups were compared by analysis
of variance (ANOVA) methods; body weight data were
log-transformed in order to improve normality. Adverse
events were counted in each group and classified using
the VeDDRA coding system. The relationship with the
product administration was assessed according to the
ABON classification (A, probable; B, possible; O, unclassi-
fied/unknown; N, unlikely/unrelated) both by the examin-
ing veterinarian and the sponsor representative.

Results
Animals
A total of 320 cats (182 primary and 138 secondary), from
182 households, were randomised to either treatment at
17 veterinary practices in France and Spain. The majority 
of primary cats (n = 83; 46%) belonged to households
where only one cat was included in the study, followed by
households with two cats enrolled (n = 60; 33%), and by
households with three cats (n = 39; 21%).
Efficacy evaluation was performed on primary cats
only, in the ITT and PP populations. The ITT popula-
tion comprised all primary cats included in the study
(n = 182; 121cats in the lotilaner group and 61 in the
control group). The PP population comprised 178 primary
cats (120 and 58 in the lotilaner group and control group,
respectively) as four animals had deviations that prevented
their inclusion in the PP analysis. One cat was excluded
for one visit only (Day 14). All 320 cats (primary and sec-
ondary) were analysed for safety, comprising 217 cats in
the lotilaner group and 103 cats in the control group.
The efficacy results obtained in primary cats were al-
most identical for the ITT population (n = 182 cats) and
the PP population (n = 178 cats); therefore, only efficacy
results of the ITT population are presented here.
Both treatment groups from the ITT population were
homogeneous for all variables analysed prior to treat-
ment administration: sex (Z = 0.254, P = 0.8741);
age (Z = 0.452, P = 0.6510); body weight (Z = 0.267,
P = 0.7896); breed (χ2 = 12.30, df = 7, P = 0.0911); hair
length (Z = 0.991, P = 0.3216); lifestyle (mostly indoors,
mostly outdoors, indoors and outdoors; χ2 = 2.66, df = 2,
P = 0.2650); number of cats in the household (Z = 0.900,
P = 0.3680);  and flea counts (t(178) 
= 0.50, P = 0.6159)
(Table 1). Results for the safety population were simi-
lar, except for the breed variable (χ2 = 15.34, df = 7,
P = 0.0319), with more European cats in the lotilaner
group (23%)  compared with the fipronil/(S)-metho-
prene group (13%).  Seven different pure breeds of cats
were included in the ITT population, of which the most
common were European (n = 38; 21%), Persian (n = 6; 3%),
and Siamese (n = 4; 2%). All cats enrolled in the study were
successfully dosed by their owners.
One cat from each of the treatment groups was prema-
turely withdrawn from the study: in the lotilaner-treated
group, a supplementary cat died on Day 23 after being
run over by a car, a primary cat from the fipronil/
(S)-methoprene-treated group died on Day 3 following
presentation with clinical signs of dehydration and
severe dyspnoea.
Flea efficacy assessment
The average arithmetic (± standard deviation, SD)
and geometric mean flea counts over the study period
were, respectively, 0.41 and 0.19 in the lotilaner-
treated group and 8.87 and 3.59 in the fipronil/(S)-metho-
prene-treated group. The arithmetic and geometric mean
flea counts over time are displayed in Table 2. The
geometric mean flea counts over time are also shown
in Fig. 1.

groups was significant: t(176)
≥ 11.5, P < 0.0001
The overall geometric mean percentage flea reduction
for the study period was 97.7% in cats treated with loti-
laner compared with a reduction of 47.4% for cats
treated with fipronil/(S)-methoprene. Percentage flea re-
ductions for each assessment time-point are presented
in Fig. 2.
ANCOVA analysis of post-treatment flea counts and
percentage reductions in flea counts, including 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs), showed significant reductions in
the lotilaner-treated cats on Days 14 and 28 and over
the whole study (P < 0.0001) compared with the control
product-treated animals. Analysis of the CIs for flea
counts revealed that not only non-inferiority to fipronil/
(S)-methoprene could be shown for lotilaner (i.e. upper
confidence limit was below 1.25);  superiority could be 
demonstrated at all time-points and for the entire study
period as well (P < 0.0001).
In the lotilaner group, 81.0 and 81.8% cats were
flea-free on Day 14 and 28, respectively. In the fipronil/
(S)-methoprene group, 25.0% cats were flea-free at the
same time-points (Table 3).
FAD assessment
Assessment of FAD signs for primary cats with FAD on
Day 0 was performed on ten cats in the lotilaner-treated
group and six cats in the fipronil/(S)-methoprene-treated
group. Baseline analysis of clinical signs of FAD prior to
start of treatment administration did not reveal any
statistically significant differences between treatment
groups, thus confirming that they were balanced at the
Fig. 2 Geometric mean percent flea reduction of lotilaner- and fipronil/(S)-methoprene-treated cats at each assessment time-point. Difference
between groups was significant: P < 0.0001 (t(176)

= 8.13 on days 14 and 28, respectively)

beginning of the study. All clinical signs associated with
FAD could be evaluated during the study except eosino-
philic granuloma, which was not observed in any of the
study animals evaluated for FAD.
In the lotilaner group, there was a significant decrease
in the mean total FAD score on Day 14 and 28
(Wilcoxon paired-sample test: S = 22.5, P = 0.0039 for
day 14; S = 27.5, P = 0.0020 for day 28); on Day 0 the
score was 5.2, which declined to 1.8 by Day 14 and 1.3
at the end of the study. In the fipronil/(S)-methoprene
group, the mean total FAD score decreased from 6.8 on
Day 0, to 6.3 and 4.8 on Days 14 and 28 respectively,
and appeared to be not statistically significant (S = 4.5
and 6.5, P = 0.41 and 0.25 on Days 14 and 28, respect-
ively) but due to the low number of animals, statistical
significance could not be definitively assessed (Fig. 3).
Pruritus mean scores followed the same pattern as
mean total FAD scores, decreasing significantly, in the
lotilaner group, from 1.8 on Day 0 to 0.6 and 0.4 on
Days 14 and 28, respectively (S = 22.5, P = 0.0039 for
day 14; S = 27.5, P = 0.0020 for day 28). In the fipronil/
(S)-methoprene group the decrease from 1.8 (Day 0) to
1.5 (Day 14 and Day 28) was not significant (S = 2.5 and
1.5, P = 0.6250 and 0.7500, respectively) (Fig. 4). Statisti-
cally significant differences were also observed between 
the lotilaner and control groups, in the pruritus score
(t(12) 
= 2.50 and 3.71, P = 0.0281 and P = 0.00340 on
Days 14 and 28, respectively), and in the total FAD score
(t(12) 
= 3.11, P = 0.0091), averaged over the entire study
duration, with lower scores in the lotilaner group.
Safety
Safety was evaluated in 320 cats (182 primary and 138
secondary) enrolled in the study and included 217 cats
that were treated with lotilaner and 103 cats treated with
fipronil/(S)-methoprene.
Fifteen out of the 217 cats in the lotilaner-treated
group (6.91%)  and five of 103 cats (4.85%)  in the
fipronil/(S)-methoprene-treated group were affected by
non-serious, mild adverse events.
Four animals had SAEs (three in the lotilaner group
and one in the control group: 0.014% and 0.010%,  re-
spectively) during the study. Signs included abdominal
pain, digestive tract stenosis and obstruction, urinary
tract obstruction, dyspnoea, pyothorax, dehydration,
lethargy and death. Two cats died during the study - one
cat in the lotilaner group was run over by a car and onecat in the fipronil/(S)-methoprene group was diagnosed
with pyothorax. Two other cats in the lotilaner group
presented one with urinary tract obstruction requiring
surgical intervention and the other one with the
presence of a foreign body in the gastrointestinal tract
requiring surgery. These cats made a full recovery
post-intervention and completed the study. None of the
SAEs was assessed as being related to the study treatment.
Fisher’s exact test showed that the number of cats af-
fected by adverse events or serious adverse events was
not significantly different between the two groups for

The average body weight of the lotilaner-treated cats
was 3.95 kg (SD 1.59, range 1.00–10.50 kg) and for the
fipronil/(S)-methoprene-treated cats was 3.89 kg (SD
1.57, range 1.00–8.00 kg),  at baseline (Day 0).  There
were no significant differences between treatment
groups in body weights of cats on Day 0 (t(160) 
= 0.12,
P = 0.9064) and body weights as well as body weight
gain on Days 14 and 28 (t(176)

see Table 4.
Environmental pressure
Data on environmental pressure in the week before a
scheduled visit were recorded on Days 0, 14 (± 2) and
28 (± 2). The number of animals (cats and dogs) diag-
nosed with a flea infestation during the last 7 days prior
to each case visit ranged over all study sites between
eight (week of 26 October 2015) and 32 cases (week of
20 July 2015).  The estimated average number of

Discussion
Both lotilaner and fipronil/(S)-methoprene groups dem-
onstrated post-treatment flea counts reduction. Results
showed that cats treated with lotilaner had significantly
lower flea counts on Days 14 and 28 and over the entire
study (P < 0.0001) compared with animals treated with
fipronil/(S)-methoprene. Credelio™ was shown to be
superior to Frontline Combo® Spot-on (P < 0.0001) at
both time points and on average.
A percentage of 6.91 Credelio™ cats and 4.85 cats
treated with Frontline Combo® Spot-on were affected
by adverse events. The difference was not statistically
significant. In addition, no significant differences be-
tween the two groups of cats in body weight change
were observed.
The choice of the two different regions in which the
study was performed, ensured assessment of the product
efficacy in different climatic and geographic conditions
and with a high environmental infestation pressure, in
compliance with the European guidelines.
The sub-optimal comparison between an orally admin-
istered product (Credelio™) against a topically applied
treatment (Frontline Combo® Spot-on) was driven by the
lack of availability of an oral product for cats, which was
active against fleas and ticks. The study described in this
Page 9
Cavalleri et al. Parasites & Vectors (2018) 11:410  Page 9 of 10
publication was designed to evaluate efficacy against
fleas only. The geographical regions in which the study
was conducted were known to have a high prevalence of
ticks. Although oral products with efficacy against fleas
on cats were available, the sponsor chose not to use
those since to have used these products would have ex-
posed the cats to the risks of vector-borne disease trans-
mission from infected ticks. Lotilaner tablets had proven
to be efficacious against the main European cat tick
(Ixodes ricinus) in three pivotal laboratory studies [7]
while its efficacy against all ticks of relevance in Europe
(I. ricinus,  I. hexagonus,  Dermacentor reticulatus and
Rhipicephalus sanguineus), was demonstrated in a large
field study performed in three different European coun-
tries [16].
Since a topical isoxazoline for cats was not available
at the time the study was performed, the applicant
decided to choose one of the most commonly used
cat parasiticides.
The choice of the comparator product dictated the
minimum body weight of the cats for inclusion (1 kg).
In the pivotal target animal safety studies, lotilaner was
shown to be safe for cats as light as 0.5 kg [9] but since
the control product label indicated a higher minimum
body weight, in order to maintain the blinding and pre-
vent the introduction of a bias, the minimum body
weight of 1 kg at inclusion was selected.
Flea counts and analysis of the demographics and re-
lated variables showed that the Credelio™ and Frontline
Combo® Spot-on populations were homogeneous at
baseline, with the exception of the cat breeds, with a
higher percentage of cats of European breed in the Cre-
delio™ group. This was considered of no relevance since
the breed per se has no impact on the performance of an
ectoparasiticide product. The only related variable po-
tentially confounding study results might have been a
higher number of cats with long hair in one of the
groups, but the comparison of hair length showed that
the two treatment groups were not different for this
variable, at baseline.
The evaluation of the efficacy against fleas was per-
formed without consideration of the flea species, since
Ctenocephalides felis is recognised to be the most preva-
lent species in cats in Europe [17]. For the other relevant
European flea species (Ctenocephalides canis), a previous
in vitro study, in which the susceptibilities of European
strains of C. felis and of C. canis to lotilaner were com-
pared in a contact test (unpublished data), had demon-
strated an equivalent or higher susceptibility of C. canis
when compared to C. felis.  The efficacy of lotilaner
against C. canis was confirmed in a dose confirmation
laboratory study and in a European field study in dogs
(unpublished data and [18],  respectively).  Both studies
were pivotal, well controlled, randomized, blinded and 
performed in compliance with GCP (good clinical
practice) standards.
Since there were only ten cats in the lotilaner group
and six in the fipronil/(S)-methoprene group showing
signs of FAD at baseline, the study has limited power for
the non-parametric comparison to baseline in the latter,
for the evaluation of the improvement in the clinical
signs of FAD. A similar consideration is valid for the
non-parametric comparison to baseline in the lotilaner
group, with a maximum of five cats showing each sign
at baseline, except for pruritus, crusts, and total FAD
score, with nine to ten animals affected at baseline. Still,
from the analysis within the lotilaner group only, it can
be concluded that FAD signs improved substantially over
the course of the study.
Administration compliance was 100% in the Credelio™
group, showing that the tablets were easy for pet owners
to administer and well accepted by the cats.
Conclusions
Lotilaner chewable tablets for cats (Credelio™) at the rec-
ommended minimum dose rate of 6 mg/kg body weight
as a single oral administration in fed state, were shown
to be efficacious and safe when administered in the field
to client-owned cats. Lotilaner was non-inferior to the
approved positive control (Frontline Combo® Spot-on
Cat, fipronil/(S)-methoprene) in the treatment of natural
flea infestations for 28 ± 2 days on cats presented as
veterinary patients in France and Spain. Moreover,
Credelio™ was superior to Frontline Combo® Spot-on on
both assessment days (14, 28) and for the entire study
period (P < 0.0001).  Analysis of clinical signs of FAD
showed that animals treated with lotilaner had significantly
lower levels of pruritus, crusts and the total FAD score
compared with Frontline Combo Spot-on Cat for the en-
tire study duration. Both products were well tolerated.
