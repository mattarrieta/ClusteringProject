Abstract
While there is growing awareness of the existence and activities of Academic
Custom Writing websites, which form a small part of the contract cheating industry,
how they work remains poorly understood. Very little research has been done on
these sites, probably because it has been assumed that it is impossible to see behind
their firewalls and password protection. We have found that, with some close
scrutiny, it is indeed possible to find some ‘cracks’ in these sites through which we
can look to gain insights into the business processes that operate within them. We
have reverse engineered the business processes that operate within some of these
sites. From this we have also been able to identify three different business models
that are supported by these sites. Our analysis supports important findings about
how these sites operate that can be used to inform future strategies to detect and
deter contract cheating.

Background
Contract cheating occurs when a student procures a third party (who knows about and
benefits from the transaction) to produce academic work (that is usually, but not al-
ways assessable work) that the student then submits to an educational institution as if
it were their own. It constitutes a form of plagiarism: presenting someone else’s words
and/or ideas as your own without appropriate attribution. The contract can be either
paid or unpaid; paid work obviously involves payment in money, but unpaid work
could involve favours and other forms of mutual obligation (Lancaster and Clarke
2014a).  While there is a widespread perception that contract cheating is a recent
phenomenon, as Bertram Gallant points out in her history of academic misconduct, it
is probably one of the oldest forms of cheating there is (Bertram Gallant 2008). The
way that contract-cheating transactions occur, however, has changed over time. The
most recent changes have been a result of emerging technologies that facilitate new
ways to procure and produce bespoke academic work.
It is likely that contract cheating is not well understood by many of the academic
staff responsible for marking and administering student academic work in educational
institutions. This is hardly surprising: contract cheating is, by its very nature, covert
and duplicitous. Along side this low level of awareness, there are not, as yet, tools that

can effectively and efficiently detect contract cheating at the point of submission. Most
institutions will have had some experience of investigating and penalising students for
contract cheating and in some instances these have been reported in the media (Jacks
2016). There is a growing concern across the Higher Education sector that the number
of instances being detected is considerably smaller than the volume of work being pro-
cured, produced and submitted to institutions for assessment. Concomitantly, there is
almost certainly a widespread perception amongst students who are currently or who
are contemplating cheating in this way that the likelihood of their being caught and
penalised is very small indeed. Rigby et al. make the important point that in the con-
tract cheating market place ‘the demand for essays involves the interplay of risk, penal-
ties and the payoffs and the ethics, norms and risk preferences of the individual facing
the option to buy’ (Rigby et al. 2015 p23). A low risk of detection is, therefore, almost
certainly an important influencing factor for at least some students. Macdonald and
Carroll are at pains to point out that detection alone is not an adequate solution to the
problem of academic misconduct (Macdonald and Carroll 2006). Detection, however,
can contribute in useful ways to a holistic approach to deterrence and is therefore a
critical part of the management of academic integrity in any educational institution.
The premise of this paper is that in order to improve detection, it is first important to
understand better how the business of contract cheating works.
There are several ways in which contract cheating transactions take place. In his 2009
paper “Contract Cheating: A New Phenomenon in Cyber-Plagiarism” Mahmood divides
the contract cheating problem into five segments: bespoke essay sites, using friends and
family, discussion sites, tutorial sites and auction sites (Mahmood 2009). In their more
recent paper, Newton and Lang also divide the problem into five sections that are
slightly different to Mahmood’s: academic custom writing, online labour markets, pre-
written essay banks, file-sharing sites and paid exam takers (Newton and Lang 2015).
This paper suggests that neither of these views provide a fully comprehensive descrip-
tion of the different segments of contract cheating and that it is useful to combine
them to identify instead six segments: family and friends; academic custom writing
sites; legitimate learning sites (eg. file sharing, discussion and microtutoring sites); legit-
imate non-learning sites (eg. freelancing sites and online auction sites);  paid exam
takers; and pre-written essay banks. It is on the second of these segments – academic
custom writing sites – that this paper focuses its attention.
There is a growing body of scholarly work on contract cheating. To date the bulk of it has
been undertaken by Clarke and Lancaster who have focussed their attention on the use of
legitimate freelancing and auction sites for the purposes of contract cheating (see Clarke &
Lancaster, 2006, 2007, 2013; Lancaster & Clarke, 2014a, 2014b). Wallace and Newtown have
also investigated the speed of production of contract cheating procured and produced
through these types of site (Wallace and Newton 2014). The scholarly work on academic
custom writing sites has considered such things as the legality of the transactions (Newton
and Lang 2015; Draper et al. 2017), the quality of work being produced (Lines 2016), the
writers who produce the work (Bartlett 2009; Sivasubramaniam et al. 2016), the ability of
markers to detect essays purchased from these sites (Dawson and Sutherland-Smith 2017)
and the variety of features used by the sites to persuade students to use their services
(Rowland et al. 2017). This paper offers some initial findings that have resulted from a close
examination of a selection of sites associated with academic custom writing.

This paper does not include any information that specifically identifies any of
these sites in order to avoid promoting any individual companies (see Draper et al.
2017).  Information relating to these sites has been made available to the reviewers
and also to the Australian Tertiary Education Quality Standards Authority
(TEQSA) and the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) in the United Kingdom. The
analysis is based on the examination of these sites in particular and this paper
makes no claims that these findings represent the academic custom writing indus-
try or the contract-cheating problem as a whole. The analysis does, however, offer
a useful window into part of one segment of the industry.
Method
In May 2015 the authors discovered a small number of academic custom writing
sites that were similar in appearance. While the site names, logos, images and
colour schemes of these sites were different, the structure of the sites looked to be
remarkably similar. We surmised that it was likely that these sites had something
in common and that there might be more sites like them. A reverse Domain Name
Server (rDNS) look up was used to see if there were other websites associated with
the Internet Protocol (IP) numbers that were associated with the sites we had
already found. An rDNS look up is a way of querying the domain name of an IP
address, which is the reverse of how websites are usually accessed via a browser.
The process can be used to reveal the Universal Resource Locators (URL) of other
websites using the same IP numbers. Through this process other sites were identi-
fied that clearly related to contract cheating.
Through this process over 130 sites were found that are the type most obviously rec-
ognisable as contract-cheating sites. These sites display the persuasive features that
Rowland et al. have identified as being typical of academic custom writing sites sites.
They divide these features into three categories: informativeness (eg information about
services offered and terms of use), credibility (eg assurances of the quality of both the
writers and the work produced, as well as of price, of privacy and of payment security)
and involvement (eg offering customers 24/7 live text chat services, social media and
personal accounts) (Rowland et al. 2017).  Many of the sites provide phone numbers
with British, American and/or Australian area codes. Toll-free forwarding phone num-
bers (that allow owners of online businesses to offer clients local phone numbers that
are forwarded to a phone line in a different geographic location) make it likely that
these sites are not necessarily operating out of one or any of these locations. We call
these sites ‘client sites’  as they are where student ‘clients’  place orders for academic
work to be produced for them.
Through this rDNS process we were surprised to discover two other types of site that
were clearly associated with the academic custom writing industry. These are markedly
different to these client sites in the features they displayed. The first are sites that invite
people to register as writers in order to work to produce custom written essays. We call
these ‘writer sites’ and we found over 30 of these. The persuasive features of these sites
typically include assurances of the quantity of work available, the ability for writers to
work from home, generous pay (including bonuses) and the availability of a wide range
of writing projects in different disciplines. The second are sites that offer to set up, in
return for a fee, fully integrated academic writing websites. We call these ‘master sites’
Page 4

and we found four sites in total that are linked together as two pairs. These sites offer
pricing structures, live demonstrations – what they call ‘live demos’ – and a list of fea-
tures of the sites they offer to build. One of the key features listed on these sites is that
they build two separate types of site: a writer site that also functions as an administra-
tor site and one or more client sites that are linked together and to what they refer to
as the ‘admin/writer’ site. This offered an indiciation that there may have been some
kind of link between the client and writer sites already found. Indeed the two pairs of
master sites are constructed and joined together in this way in order to demonstrate
this structure to potential buyers. The two sites in one pair display identical contact
phone numbers and email addresses while the two sites in the other pair display identi-
cal email addresses only.
The discovery of these three different types of sites indicate that the structure of aca-
demic custom writing sites is potentially more complex and sophisticated than had
been previously reported in the scholarly literature. There is a widespread assumption
in the literature that what we call client sites constitute a single, self-contained aca-
demic custom writing business. These initial findings indicated that this was not the
case. Our hypothesis was that the main administrative component of these online busi-
nesses is actually the writer sites and that in many instances multiple client sites were
all part of the one company.
To find evidence to support this hypothesis initial information was gathered from a
variety of sources from the client and writer sites discovered through the rDNS look up
within the time frame of a single week in December 2017. This short time frame was
used because of the highly volatile nature of these sites; they have a tendency to go into
and out of existence frequently. First IP numbers and Internet Service Provider (ISP)
names were collected for all the sites. This information was used to identify a total of
37 client sites and 10 writer sites that appeared to cluster around identical IP numbers
and ISP names. Then, for each of the 37 client sites, the order process was initiated,
stopping just prior to order submission to determine the identifier (eg PayPal identity)
of the merchant that would receive payment (had the order been completed).  The
phone numbers advertised on the sites were recorded. None of the writer sites advertise
phone numbers and because they do not need to accept payment, it is also not possible
to gather merchant identifiers from them.
In addition, two sets of information from the two pairs of master sites were gathered.
The first set was the features list that explains to potential buyers the nature of the
products (i.e. separate ‘admin/writer’  and client sites) that are available for purchase
from these sites. The second set was gathered by investigating the so-called ‘live demos’
that are made available for the purposes of allowing guests to explore the functionality
of the client and writer sites. These ‘demos’ gave access to the features that only the
owners and the site administrators of these writer and client sites would normally see.
The information gathered from these ‘demos’  enabled the reverse engineering of the
business processes operating within the client and writer sites. This was done by using
the guest login user names and passwords advertised on one of the master sites to enter
the demonstration sites and then to observe, analyse and record the functions afforded,
the business rules enforced and the business roles supported by the website. These
were then compared with the features promoted by both master sites. While the fea-
tures of the master sites differ slightly, the general nature of the functions and business
Page 5
Ellis et al. International Journal for Educational Integrity (2018) 14:1  Page 5 of 21
processes observed are substantively similar. From this a single business process that
operates within the client and writer sites offered for sale from these master sites was
documented.
Findings
Academic custom writing site structure
Our investigation has confirmed the basic structure of the academic custom writing
businesses that we have discovered: at least one writer site accompanied by at least
one, and in most instances several, client sites. Multiple client sites that share identical
Paypal information, phone numbers, IP addresses and ISP names were found. This
makes it highly likely that each of these clusters of client sites is operating as a single
business. The fact that these sites all have different domain names but share identical
IP addresses indicates that they are making use of shared web hosting, which is a cost
effective way of making websites available online and is a further strong indicator of a
relationship between these sites.
While it is not possible to definitively prove which writer sites are linked to which
clusters of client sites, the fact that the IP and ISP locations shared by these client sites
are each shared with at least a single writer site indicates that they too are using the
same shared web hosting as the client sites. While it is not possible to definitively prove
from this information that the sites are interlinked, the alignment of all of these factors
is highly unlikely to be coincidental (see Table 1 and Fig. 1). It is also not possible to
definitively prove which, or indeed if any, of the client/writer site combinations have
been built by either of the two master sites. However, the fact that the writer and client
site structure that they offer to build is also reflected in the interrelationship of client
and writer sites found adjacent to them via the rDNS look up corroborates that this is
a viable, and probably prevalent, structure for these types of site.
The relationships between the client sites and the writer sites all confirms the likeli-
hood that one or multiple client sites are owned and/or maintained by the same person
or company alongside at least one writer site and are operating as separate ‘shop win-
dows’ for a single business. After all, the more client sites that are linked through to a
writer site, the greater the potential for market exposure. This allows a single site
owner to cater to distinct markets such as different discipline areas (for instance, sites
specifically appealing to nursing or engineering students) or to geographic locations
(for instance, sites specifically targeted to British or Australian students). This estab-
lishes the illusion of choice and/or specialisation. The client interface allows students
to place orders and to communicate with the site staff about their order. The writer
sites provide an interface for the freelance writers to be allocated and/or to bid for
available orders, and to submit and revise the work they have completed.
Academic custom writing site business processes
Administration roles
As the features listed on the master sites explains, the writer sites also function as admin-
istrator sites. The analysis of the features list and subsequent investigation of the ‘live
demos’  confirm that these sites support multiple roles including order evaluation,
payment processing, quality assurance, customer service and support, technical support,

Fig. 1 Alignment of multiple 'client' sites with a single 'admin/writer' site
workforce management, and dispute resolution. In a section called ‘create new user’ the
sites allow for each of these roles to be set up so that different people can undertake them
separately. There is also an administrator role that is a kind of super-user role, incorporat-
ing all of the other other roles into one (see Fig. 2). The fact that the web software enables
these roles to be undertaken by one person or, alternatively, by different people in each of
the roles indicates that the software has been specifically designed to scale with the
owner’s business. This is almost certainly to accommodate increasingly higher volumes of
orders and growing staff numbers. For the sake of simplicity, in the description of the
Fig. 2 Screenshot of create new user function in the 'demo' site showing administrative roles

business roles and processes below, the relevant staff member undertaking a task is re-
ferred to as an ‘adminstrator’.
Order form
First this paper turns to explain the process of managing and completing orders as ob-
served and experienced on the client site that is part of the master site that was ana-
lysed. On the front page there is a large order button that links through to an order
page. Clicking on this starts the process, which subsequently prompts clients to enter a
range of information into an order form (see Fig. 3). The order form demonstrated on
the two master sites shares many features with those on many but not all of the client
sites. First it requires users to key in the topic for the order and then to select all or
most of the following from a series of pull down menus and check boxes: the subject
(discipline) area, the type of document (eg essay, term paper, dissertation chapter), the
number of words which is also measured in pages, the line spacing, the urgency (mea-
sured in time),  the academic level (ranging from High School to PhD),  the required
number of sources, the referencing style and the preferred language style (US or UK
English). Clients are invited to enter information into a window entitled ‘order descrip-
tion’ which instructs them to ‘type your instructions here’. On the live sites, clients are
required to enter in their names and contact information and to register with a pass-
word for the site. Clients are also given the opportunity to upload additional files at a
later stage of their order. The final stage of the ordering process adds up the costing of
the variables for the academic work and requests payment from the customer.
There are four variables that affect the price of the order: the discipline, the length of
the paper, the urgency and the academic level. The cost variance by discipline on the
actual client sites differs from one site to another. On some sites, all disciplines are
available at the same rate while on others, some disciplines attract a higher per-page
rate that on some sites is referred to as a ‘complex assignment charge’. Generally speak-
ing, Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) subjects like Physics,
Chemistry, Aeronautics and Statistics are more expensive than Humanities, Arts and
Social Sciences (HASS) subjects like English, History, Business and Sociology. Most
sites also offer additional services such as ‘VIP support’  and ‘Written by Top 10
Writers’ that incur an extra one-off or per-page fee. Many offer discount vouchers for
return customers, for recommending a friend and/or for orders over a set amount that
can reduce the final cost. The cost variance across these sites warrants further investi-
gation but is outside the scope of this paper.
Order management
This paper now turns to explain what happens after the orders have been lodged. This
workflow has been represented diagrammatically using a business process diagram that
shows the major steps of the order completion from the point of view of the site owner
(see Fig. 4). Administrators adjust the status of an order as it moves through the vari-
ous stages of being filled. On the ‘demo’ site we analysed, the site administrators are
able to adjust the status by selecting an order from a list using a check box and then
clicking one of a number of different buttons which include: ‘make available’, ‘mark as
done’, ‘return to editing’, ‘return to revision’, ‘un approve’, ‘remove’ and ‘delete’ (see Fig. 5).
This is illustrated using a diagram that tracks each of the logical states that an order
can take from first inquiry to completion (see Fig. 6).

When orders are placed on the site they are automatically set to ‘pending.’  At
this point an administrator vets the orders to ensure that they are legitimate and
that they contain enough information for a writer to produce the work that is
required. If it does not, the order’s status is changed to ‘rejected’. If it does the or-
der’s status is changed to ‘available’.

Fig. 6 State diagram
Most client and writer sites have a publicly available Rich Site Summary (RSS) feed
that is populated with information relating to orders placed on the site. This function is
disabled on the ‘demo’ (presumably to avoid test orders from being publicly published).
The RSS facility is nevertheless available on the master site albeit in an empty state (see
Fig. 7). The existence of the RSS feed is not described in the features list of either mas-
ter site so its precise purpose is not clear. We have inferred how it probably works and
how it is populated.
Fig. 7 Screenshot of RSS feed function in the 'demo' site
Page 14
Ellis et al. International Journal for Educational Integrity (2018) 14:1  Page 14 of 21
RSS feeds emerged in 1999 as a means of publishing (through aggregation and syndi-
cation) frequently updated online content so that readers can easily track it. The fact
that the initials RSS are often taken to mean Really Simple Syndication gives an
indication of the simple and interoperable format that these feeds take. The logical
purpose of the RSS feeds emerging from these sites is to allow writers to maintain easy
and immediate access to new orders as they become available, particularly if they are
working for multiple companies.
It is possible to be confident that the content emerging from these sites via the RSS
feeds relates to orders placed by student clients. There are, however, many aspects of
these feeds about which it is not possible to be certain. Prime amongst these is the fact
that RSS feeds from a particular site can contain orders that are duplicated in feeds
from other sites. There are at least three different possible reasons for these duplica-
tions. The first is a result of the interlinked nature of the websites, whereby the one
order is distributed (or syndicated) to multiple feeds, presumably in order to make it
visible to the largest possible number of available writers (see Table 1). The second is
when multiple students in the same course order the same piece of academic work
from one or multiple sites. The third is when unclaimed orders (i.e. orders for which a
writer has not yet been allocated) and work that has not been started or satisfactorily
completed by a previously allocated writer are readvertised via the feed. These orders
then become available for reallocation to another writer.
Another thing that cannot be known for certain about these RSS feeds is whether the
orders emerging from a site are all the orders that are placed on that site. The date
stamps of the feeds cluster closely together which indicates that a staff member work-
ing for the site publishes them manually rather than being generated automatically
when an order is placed. The most logical moment in the workflow for this to happen
is after an order has been vetted and before it has been assigned. It is possible, there-
fore, that in practice the orders that are pushed to the RSS feeds represent only a sub-
set of the orders that come into the site. This may be because site owners and a select
group of writers give themselves the first option to complete orders as they come into
the site and it is only the residue of unclaimed orders that is subsequently sent through
the RSS feed. From the information contained in these feeds it is not possible to ascer-
tain who has placed the order, exactly when they placed it, at which institution they are
studying, whether the order has been filled and, if so, whether it was subsequently sub-
mitted to an institution for assessment. What it does make certain is that a student has
placed an order for the work to be done.
Bidding and writer status
As explained on the features list of the master sites, writers are given different levels of
access to orders. An administrator can enter an area called ‘writers administration page’
and select a writer or writers from a list using a check box and then choose the relevant
status from a pull down menu. In one master site the writer statuses are set as ‘silver’,
‘gold’ and ‘platinum’ and on the other they are ‘normal’, ‘silver’ and ‘advanced’. In this
same area of the site, the administrator is also able to select writers and click buttons
entitled ‘approve’, ‘ban’, ‘de activate’, ‘delete’ and ‘reset password’ to manage other aspects
of a writer’s work status and access to the site (see Fig. 8). The features list of both
master sites explain that the different status levels are awarded once writers prove the
Page 15
Ellis et al. International Journal for Educational Integrity (2018) 14:1  Page 15 of 21
Fig. 8 Screenshot of writers administration page in the 'demo' site showing writer status
quality of their work. The ‘site settings’ section allows an administrator to adjust the
number of orders for which a writer at each status level is entitled to claim and bid
using an edit function (see Fig. 9).  Once an order is allocated to a writer its status
changes to ‘assigned’.
Quality assurance
Once the writers have completed the work, the writers upload the orders back to the sites.
The orders are then put through a quality control process overseen by an administrator.
At this point an administrator changes the order’s status to ‘editing’. If through this quality
control process it is deemed that the work requires further revisions it is sent back to the
writer for adjustment. At this point its status is changed to ‘revision’. If an order is claimed
by a writer but not filled on time or to an appropriate level of quality, an administrator
can make it available for reallocation to other writers. At this point its status reverts to
‘unconfirmed’. Once the completed work has been approved through the quality control
process the order’s status is changed to ‘completed.’ At this point it is made available to
the client who has ordered the work. If the client is happy with the quality of the work
provided, they can confirm the order as completed. At this point its status changes to ‘ap-
proved’. If they are not happy, they can ask for a revision. At this point the order’s status
reverts to ‘revision’. If they remain unsatisfied after the revision process, they can further
escalate their concerns at which point the order’s status changes to ‘dispute’.
It is useful to note at this point two particularly striking features of these sites. The
first is the sophisticated nature of the workflows that operate within them. The second
is the meticulous nature of the quality assurance and dispute resolution mechanisms
built into the workflow.

Discussion
Business models
As George and Bock point out, ‘definitions for business models vary widely’  (George
and Bock 2011 p. 83). For the purposes of this paper we use a definition offered by
Amit and Zott: ‘A business model depicts the design of transaction content, structure
and governance so as to create value through the exploitation of business opportunities’
(Amit and Zott 2001 p. 495). There are three different business models at work within
this particular set of academic custom writings sites.
The first, and simplest, business model is that of the writers are working as self-
employed freelancers. Dave Tomar – who is probably better known by his original
pseudonym Ed Dante and by the moniker the Shadow Scholar – has described this
business model in some detail in an article (Dante 2010) and subsequent book
(Tomar 2012).  His choice of the pseudonym ‘Dante’  is apt as he refers to the
working life he experienced as a writer for academic custom writing companies as
being his ‘personal hell’  (Tomar 2012 p. 157).  A Chronicle of Higher Education re-
port by Xian Bu has identified some of these writers as graduates living in Kenya
who report earning between USD5000 and USD14 000 per month (which Bu re-
ports compares very favourably to their public service salaries of USD500 per
month and against the per capita gross national income of Kenya which is around
USD1300) (Bu 2016).  Bu’s article also reports on a subsidiary aspect to this
business model: the onselling of writers’  accounts. The fact that the writers are
given different status levels, with attendant privileges as outlined above, explains
how there is value in an established writing profile once a certain status level has
been obtained.
Page 17
Ellis et al. International Journal for Educational Integrity (2018) 14:1  Page 17 of 21
The second business model – that builds on and amplifies the first – is that of the aca-
demic custom writing business owner. This business model creates value by establishing a
marketable web presence and then benefits by taking a portion of the revenue generated
by client orders. A report in the Chronicle of Higher Education by Brad Wolverton quotes
a site owner explaining that he takes 50% of the revenue and pays the writers the rest
(Wolverton 2016). Tomar also reports: ‘Almost universally, wherever I have worked, you
collect half the money and the company collects the other half’ (Tomar 2012 p. 141).
The third and final business model is that of the master site owners who build aca-
demic custom writing sites – that is both the admin/writer and client sites – for a fee.
This business model – that builds on and amplifies the first and second models – cre-
ates value by selling pre-designed, proven and tested web applications with all the busi-
ness processes built in and the instructions on how to use them for a one-off payment.
These master sites design the logos and brands for these websites and also offer web-
hosting and application management.
Site structure
Clearly these sites are clustered together with one or multiple client sites linked to-
gether with a writer site using the same shared web hosting, PayPal addresses and
phone numbers. The fact that these match what is being advertised on the master sites
makes it likely that the same person or people built them using the same template. If
so, they will also have similar or identical business processes operating within them.
This is an example of business process isomorphism, which Masini defines as a
‘phenomenon whereby organizations tend to display similar business processes [which]
can be associated with the adoption of similar software packages containing similar
process templates’  (Masini 2009 p. 109). It is possible that the owners of the master
sites have designed the software that they sell based on their own experiences as writers
within the academic custom writing industry and have modelled their sites on the expe-
riences they have had. It is also likely that people who have previously worked as
writers move on to establishing their own businesses (client and writer sites). This en-
ables them to take on a role that may be both less labour intensive and more lucrative.
In this role, the site owners probably earn on average 50% of the revenue for orders
completed by other writers. They are also able to reserve easy and lucrative writing or-
ders for themselves for which they earn all of the revenue. These master sites, there-
fore, cater to individuals who aspire to establish businesses of their own but do not
have the skills or time to design and build their own websites.
Speed of production, and quality control and assurance
A core component of the business model of these sites is their ability to link clients’ or-
ders with as many writers possible. From the site owner’s point of view, this is desirable
because it makes it more likely that the order will be filled in the required time frame,
thereby satisfying the client. The exposure of each order to as many writers as possible
also increases the competition for the orders amongst the writers. This reduces the cost
of production, thereby making the commodity more affordable and attractive to poten-
tial clients. Because of the fixed pricing model, the site administrators are able to secure
the bulk of the revenue regardless of where the bidding lands amongst writers.

The extensive quality control and assurance processes built into the workflows of
these businesses indicates how important it is for these sites to produce work to a level
of quality that satisfies their clients. The specialised roles of quality assurance, customer
service and support, and dispute resolution that are provided for in these sites are fur-
ther indications of the importance of customer satisfaction for this business model. As
Lines confirms, the quality of the work being produced by the sites she investigates is
literally of a passable standard (Lines 2016 p. 18). Ensuring the quality of work being
produced by these sites is crucial to maintaining two of the most important sources of
new work: return customers and their personal recommendation to new clients.
From the writers’  point of view, it is in their best interests to seek out orders that
they find easy to fill (which will vary depending on their disciplinary expertise and pre-
vious writing experience) and which will be lucrative. In his book Tomar describes his
approach to stockpiling orders:
I would grab up the paper, and it would go on top of the huge, miserable pile of shit
that I had to shovel through. […] As soon as I finished one paper, I started another.
As soon as I submitted an assignment, I went to the writers’ board and picked up
another one to take its place. (Tomar 2012 p. 174–5).
Bu also offers a description of the stockpiling approach taken by ‘Solomon’, one of
the Kenyan writers he interviewed for his article. It is strikingly similar to Tomar’s de-
scription: ‘Orders come through the companies’  websites, and sometimes a dozen
writers will vie for one. Whoever acts fastest gets it’ (Bu 2016 np). This practice is illus-
trated by an image in Wolverton’s article of a handwritten list of orders ‘stockpiled’ by
a writer, with the caption: ‘a professional cheater’s little black book of assignments’
(Wolverton 2016 np). It is clear from these descriptions that the practice of stockpiling
orders by writers to secure a reliable stream of income is fairly standard. As explained
earlier, in the sites examined in this paper, the writers have to earn their right to claim
and stockpile work in this way. For the writers to have the best chance of spotting and
claiming the orders that best suit their skills they need to maintain easy, constant ac-
cess to orders as they become available. This is the role of the RSS feed.
The feed saves writers the time and trouble of regularly logging in to one or multiple
writers’ sites to check for new orders. Instead, the writers probably subscribe to the
feeds and use an RSS reader to keep track of new orders as they become available in
real time. Being able to access these feeds makes it much easier for writers to work for
multiple sites. The feed, therefore, provides site owners with a quick, easy and cheap
mechanism for advertising available orders to a wide pool of writers. It also provides
writers with a quick, easy and cheap mechanism for monitoring orders and claiming
them as quickly as possible. Wallace and Newton found that “requested turnaround
times for contract cheating are, on average 5 days, and there appears to be a large cap-
acity for shorter turnaround times to be achieved” (Wallace and Newton 2014 p. 235).
The fact that orders with short ‘urgency’ times are the most lucrative and the existence
of these RSS feeds that allow writers to bid quickly for orders together offer a compel-
ling explanation as to why the turnaround times can be so short.
In the first decade of the twenty-first Century when Tomar was working as a writer
in the academic custom writing industry the barriers to entering the market as a site
Page 19
Ellis et al. International Journal for Educational Integrity (2018) 14:1  Page 19 of 21
owner were higher than they are now. The technical expertise required to establish a
website and manage the eCommerce of such an enterprise meant that the sector prob-
ably had a much smaller number of sites. Now, as explained above, the master sites will
set up the complete package thus eliminating the need to have any coding skills. These
sites also facilitate web hosting and management services alongside a tried and tested
set of business processes. The skills required to operate and administer these sites once
they are established require only basic computer literacy and business acumen. Com-
panies like PayPal have also made it much easier for clients and site owners to manage
foreign currency transactions.
Conclusions and recommendations
As indicated at the outset of this paper, in order to improve the deterrence and detec-
tion of contract cheating, it is important to understand better the problem. To that
end, the information and findings offered in this paper provide new information to aca-
demics and institutions about the business processes and models that sit behind some
academic custom writing sites. These sites make up one part of one segment of the
contract-cheating problem as a whole.
The business models that are supported by the sites investigated here appear to be
well established and mature. This indicates that there is a substantial market that is
feeding this industry. The sophisticated quality assurance processes built into the work-
flows supported by these sites indicate how important the quality of the work produced
within them is to all three business models. This shows how important return business
and word-of-mouth recommendations are but also how likely it is that the quality of
the work being produced by the sites is, at least, of a passable standard. Alongside this,
the existence of the RSS feeds indicates the importance of speed and efficiency to the
industry. Together, these confirm that the priority for both the site owners and their
student clients is for the orders to be filled on time and to good enough quality. For fu-
ture research on these sites, it is important to be careful not to assume that different
sites are running as separate businesses; in some instances this may be the case but in
other instances they may simply be different ‘shop windows’ for the same company.
Finally, this paper offers some advice about practical things every academic and insti-
tution can do to improve their chances of both detecting and deterring contract cheat-
ing. In terms of detection, the fact that the RSS feeds that come out of the client sites
are publicly available means that they can be picked up by a web search. The RSS feeds
frequently contain text provided by students, which is often the exact wording of as-
sessment briefs that have been copied by them directly onto the order forms. Aca-
demics who routinely undertake a web search using text taken from their assessment
briefs are likely to be able quickly and easily to identify if orders for work have been
placed on these academic custom writing sites. While this will rarely provide enough
information to identify any one particular student who has ordered the work, it will
alert academics to be vigilant for it amongst the work that they are marking. This sug-
gests that to be effective as a deterrence tool, academic staff responsible for marking
student work could benefit from information, support and training on what to look out
for and how act to on anything that raises their suspicions (see Dawson and
Sutherland-Smith 2017).
Page 20
Ellis et al. International Journal for Educational Integrity (2018) 14:1  Page 20 of 21
In the, albeit limited, literature on contract cheating, one proposed solution to the
problem is to limit the time span between releasing the assessment brief and the due
date (Mahmood 2009; O’Malley and Roberts 2011). Even though students who are pro-
curing work with days or even hours to spare are spending more money than their bet-
ter organised peers who place orders weeks in advance, there is evidence that writers
seek these orders out and compete with other writers for them because they provide
the more lucrative work. The sad reality is that a lot of the work that is being produced
by academic custom writing sites is being churned out very quickly indeed. As noted
by Wallace and Newton (2014) reducing the turnaround time is unlikely to prevent or
deter contract cheating using these sites and may even encourage it by placing extra
pressures on students.
The covert nature of this industry means that their advertising outlets are relatively
limited. It is clear from our analysis that the sites investigated here rely heavily on re-
turn business but also from word-of-mouth recommendations from their clients. As a
result, it is likely that students (including those who have not used and never intend to
use the services of these sites) are very aware of contract cheating being undertaken via
academic custom writing sites. Institutions need to consider making it easier for stu-
dents to report any concerns they have about the behaviours of their peers. It might
also be wise to provide mechanisms and support for students undertaking group work
to report any suspicions they have of someone in their group using an academic cus-
tom writing site, and to remind them of the potential damage it could do to all of them.
It is also important that academic staff take responsibility for having conversations with
their students about the problem of contract cheating. The topic of one such conversa-
tion may be to let students know that the privacy and security of these sites is not as
robust as they may imagine, given that the RSS feeds routinely post publicly available
information about orders made to the site.
In order to have these conversations, it is first vital that all academic staff and the in-
stitutions for which they work become aware of and better understand the problem.
We all need to be more vigilant in our efforts and that means acknowledging that it is
happening and making serious efforts to socialise this knowledge and talk about it with
our teaching colleagues.
