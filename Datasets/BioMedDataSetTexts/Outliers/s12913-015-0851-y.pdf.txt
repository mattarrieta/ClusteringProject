Abstract
This editorial introduces the special Biomed Central cross-journal collection The Many Meanings of ‘Quality’ in Healthcare:
Interdisciplinary Perspectives, setting out the context for the development of the collection, and presenting brief summaries
of all the included papers in three broad themes 1) the practices of assuring quality in healthcare 2) giving ‘space to
the story’ 3) addressing moral complexity in the clinic, the classroom and the academy. The editorial concludes with
reflections on some of the key messages that emerge from the papers which are relevant to policymakers and
practitioners who seek to improve the quality of healthcare.
Editorial
This special Biomed Central cross-journal collection The
Many Meanings of ‘Quality’ in Healthcare: Interdisciplin-
ary Perspectives presents papers written by authors with a
range of disciplinary backgrounds (spanning medicine, so-
cial policy, anthropology, accountancy, philosophy, design,
to name a few) whose work engages directly with notions
of ‘quality’  in healthcare. The inspiration for this collec-
tion began with a colloquium of the same title which we
organised in June 2013 at Cumberland Lodge, Great
Windsor Park, UK [1,2].  This event brought together
health professionals, academics, policymakers and patient
representatives (predominantly but not exclusively UK-
based) to unpack the notion of ‘quality’ in healthcare, of-
fering an opportunity to share insights, and to discuss and
debate contemporary programmes of quality implementa-
tion, evaluation and improvement. We wanted to identify
some of the key processes and attributes of quality in
healthcare, and explore the professional values required to
support and improve it. We were also keen to discover
what might emerge when scholars from a diverse range of
disciplines were provided with a critical space in which to
wrestle with an important, controversial and politically
charged topic. We are delighted that we have been able to
capitalise on the ongoing enthusiasm and critical insights

The assiduous pursuit of ‘quality’  (usually defined with
terms such as safety, effectiveness, and positive patient ex-
perience [3,4]) is actively shaping delivery of healthcare both
nationally and internationally [5]. The UK has been at the
forefront of many such quality initiatives. Examples include:
the introduction of the Quality and Outcomes Framework
in 2004 (an incentive scheme that rewards general practi-
tioners financially for demonstrating achievement across a
range of clinical and organisational indicators); the compul-
sory revalidation of doctors since 2012 (revalidation of
nurses and midwives is planned from 2016),  and the
mandatory inspection of health and social care services by
an independent regulatory body, the Care Quality Commis-
sion, which publishes its findings as performance ratings.
Given the prominence of the term ‘quality’ across health
policy and practice and its centrality to many international
efforts to improve healthcare, it is perhaps surprising to
suggest that what we might mean when we speak of ‘qual-
ity’ remains obscure and worthy of debate [6]. However the
case for pausing to reconsider and extend our understand-
ings of ‘quality’ is strong, especially since it is increasingly
recognised that the pursuit and measurement of quality in
healthcare often fails to deliver anticipated benefits and
may have perverse consequences, undermining rather than
strengthening the characteristics it seeks to assure and re-
quiring excessive data gathering by healthcare staff [7–11].

This ‘quality paradox’  resonates through the papers pub-
lished in this special issue and is, in essence, the ‘wicked’
problem that we seek to illuminate and explore [12]. Al-
though the point of departure is healthcare activity in the
UK, the papers speak to the issue of ‘quality’ in ways which
are likely to be of relevance to policymakers and practi-
tioners internationally.
The collection brings together both empirical research
papers and articles that primarily offer theoretical engage-
ment and analysis. Whilst some authors grapple with fun-
damental conceptual concerns, others explore the practical
ways in which ‘quality’ may (or may not) become enacted
in the real world of healthcare. We believe that the value of
the special issue lies not only in the rich variety of perspec-
tives it presents, but in appreciating the connections, syner-
gies and lines of argument as they play out across the
collection. Therefore, we strongly encourage readers to put
aside disciplinary allegiances and consider straying beyond
the articles that seem most immediately appealing. Whilst
there are doubtless many alternative ways of categorising
the papers by theme, and any such categorisation overlooks
areas of overlap and linkage, we will summarise the papers
in three broad groupings: the practices of assuring quality
in healthcare; giving ‘space to the story’;  and addressing
moral complexity in the clinic, the classroom and the
academy.
1. The practices of assuring quality in healthcare
One important theme to emerge from the papers is how
the principles and systems which are intended to assure
and improve the quality of healthcare are realised in
practice. These papers emphasise the need to attend to
the everyday activities of patients, carers, clinicians and
administrators in producing and accounting for high
quality care in order to fully grasp their meanings and
consequences.
Simon Cohn’s paper focuses on the concept of ‘trust’
in healthcare, which has received renewed attention as a
possible counter-balance to the dehumanising effects of
audit and market based processes for quality assurance.
Challenging the common conception of trust as a psy-
chological state resulting from deliberative evaluations of
an individual’s behaviour, Cohn draws on ethnographic
data from a UK diabetes clinic to show how in this con-
text, trust constitutes a ‘sense of stability and predictabil-
ity’ for patients which emerges from a particular set of
relationships between people (extending beyond the
doctor-patient dyad to include family members), physical
objects (such as patient notes) and the wider material
environment [13]. He warns that singular, generalizable
concepts or measures of trust will necessarily overlook
the context-specific, dynamic and contingent qualities of
these relationships which give meaning to the trust
concept. 
Dane Pflueger’s paper makes the case for paying equiva-
lent attention to the ways in which data are produced and
used in dominant approaches to accounting for quality in
healthcare [14]. Pflueger sets out how tools such as the pa-
tient experience survey programmes and the UK Quality
and Outcomes Framework are based on a concern to ‘cap-
ture information, as a camera might’. In this context quality
improvement efforts become focused on perfecting the
technical process of data collection (‘developing sharper and
better lenses’ by adjusting data for case mix, for example),
but managers and others fail to attend to the ways in which
such data get produced in practice. Drawing on insights
from the ‘social studies of accounting’ literature, Pflueger de-
scribes how accounting ‘does not just find things out but
makes them up’, as particular tools impose certain sets of
‘preoccupations and objectives’  in order to make things
knowable. Pflueger does not suggest abandoning such ap-
proaches but rather calls for a more sociologically-informed
approach to the use of accounting, for example, cultivating a
‘skeptical calculative culture’ in which data about care qual-
ity are used as an invitation to discussion rather than a pre-
scription for action.
Swinglehurst and Greenhalgh’s paper on the production
of care records in general practice provides just such an ex-
ample of the benefits of attending to the practices by which
data for audit are produced [15]. Drawing on an ethnog-
raphy of the work of administrators in two GP practices, the
authors demonstrate how in these cases coding patients’
medical records was not principally a matter of ‘capturing’
specific diagnoses in code form, but instead comprised nu-
anced acts of interpretation, judgement and relationship-
building in order to produce a record which met the mul-
tiple and potentially conflicting needs of doctors, patients
and managers.
Greenhalgh and colleagues’ paper on quality in telehealth
and telecare provides an example of rooting quality stan-
dards in the lived experience of service users and providers
[16].  Using the principles of experience-based co-design,
the authors collected ethnographic data on service users’
and carers’ experiences of illness and assistive technologies,
and drew on interviews with healthcare providers and tech-
nology designers. The gathered insights formed the basis of
a collaborative workshop in which the participants collect-
ively developed a set of ‘design principles’ for telehealth and
telecare products and services. The project found that ‘as-
sistive technologies will always need skilled human work,
inter-sectoral negotiation and social infrastructure to en-
sure that they “work”’, and developed a framework to sup-
port the implementation of these principles in the design
and delivery of services.
The papers within this theme make a number of import-
ant contributions to contemporary policy debates about
how to improve quality in healthcare. They illuminate
how and why efforts to develop processes and products

intended to ensure against quality problems necessarily fail
in their ambitions to certainty, and can in fact be insidious.
They emphasise how all systems, processes and technologies
are in practice socially negotiated, and warn that a failure to
attend to this fact can result in ineffective policies and unin-
tended consequences. The papers also illustrate that while it
is necessary to recognise the limitations of dominant ra-
tional systems of audit and management, it is important to
move beyond pitching the ‘rational’ against the ‘real’, or ‘sys-
tems’ against ‘human’ approaches, and to attend instead to
how people can and do overcome the dysfunctional and
counterproductive effects of dominant approaches to assur-
ing the quality of healthcare in practice.
2. Giving ‘space to the story’
The papers in this theme focus on the gap between what
is easily measurable and what is meaningful in relation
to the quality of healthcare, and critique the tendency
for dominant approaches to quality evaluation to privilege
the former.
Kelly et al. provide a practical illustration of using narra-
tive and interpretation to bridge the world of biomedicine
and the patient’s life-world [17]. They report on a project
which used sewing workshops with local Bangladeshi
women as a site for developing conversations about key
health issues such as the importance of vitamin D. Through
art and story-sharing the women found a way to explore is-
sues that might not otherwise have been discussed or heard
within the constraints of the consulting room. While the
project outcomes may be difficult to measure, participants
gained confidence through sharing stories and experiences,
and group discussion gave precedence to the patients’ nar-
ratives, while still enabling clinicians to share their own ex-
pertise. The authors conceptualise the quality of these
encounters in terms of ‘ensuring a space for the story’ for
both patients and professionals.
The potential value of offering staff and patients the
opportunity to share stories and experiences is also ex-
plored in Thomson’s paper [18]. Thomson describes an
innovative outpatient project that used design-led, par-
ticipatory methods based on the metaphor of the pa-
tient’s journey to help patients with multiple sclerosis
and health care staff to develop a collective vision of
how care could be improved in the outpatient depart-
ment in the future.
Renedo and Marston highlight a particular challenge
that may arise from efforts to involve patients in quality
improvement initiatives. Drawing on ethnographic ob-
servation and analysis of interviews with patients en-
gaged in this work, the authors advise practitioners to
be aware that neoliberal ideals and rationalities domin-
ant in policy and service delivery contexts may shape
patients’  own accounts of what quality improvement
means (or should mean) in practice [19].  They report 
that although patients’  accounts initially focused on
quality improvement as dependent on collective action,
they quickly shifted towards an emphasis on the respon-
sibilities of the individual patient to improve their own
health. This finding resonates with Pflueger’s suggestion
that how quality is accounted for and operationalised in
dominant health policy discourse actively shapes practices
on the ground in ways that can be constraining as well as
enabling [14].
Papers by Tomlinson, and Farr and Cressey, also ad-
dress the need to ensure a space for the story, this time
with a particular focus on professionals’  narratives
[20,21].  Authors of both papers argue that this space
should be one in which the tacit, intangible and rela-
tional dimensions of care can be voiced, and heard, as
important aspects of quality in practice. Through in-
depth qualitative interviews with health professionals
and managers, Farr and Cressey conclude that staff
values and personal and professional standards are core
to understanding how quality is co-produced in service
interactions, challenging us to consider that what
emerges in practice may not always align with standard
performance metrics and may, at times (and for good
reason) be at odds with accepted ‘best practice’  [21].
Tomlinson suggests that one way to access these values and
standards is through narrative clinical supervision, which
can foster a culture that is supportive, educational, self-
critical, outward-looking, patient-focussed, and centred on
patient safety and quality care [20].
Millar et al. present findings from an interview study
in which they analysed the narratives of national NHS
policy actors on the role of hospital board oversight
of quality and safety [22]. The authors weave these nar-
ratives around two key themes developed from the
academic literature on assuring quality: ‘trust’  and
‘intelligence’. In particular the authors argue for the im-
portance of triangulating different forms of intelligence
to inform quality and safety activities, bringing together
performance data (such as hospital acquired infection
rates) with ‘softer’ forms of intelligence gained through
feedback and interactions with staff, patients and the
public. They call for a form of trust that goes beyond
usual metrics and proactively engages the qualitative di-
mensions of hospital life, “characterised by styles of
leadership and behaviours that are attentive to the needs
and concerns of both staff and patients”.
The papers in this section challenge normative under-
standings of quality, that is the ‘taken-for-granted’ ways in
which ‘quality’ tends to be conceptualised and ‘talked about’.
For these authors, a full appreciation of ‘quality’ means pay-
ing close attention to the unmeasurable, relational and (rela-
tively) ‘hidden’  dimensions of care by seeking to connect
with the values, culture and life-worlds of patients and staff.
‘Stories’ are one important means of achieving this.

3. Addressing moral complexity in the clinic, the
classroom and the academy
The papers in this final theme all focus on the ‘ethical’ in
order to tackle notions of quality from a distinctly norma-
tive perspective. The first paper by Emmerich et al. sug-
gests that we should reflect on the ethical consequences of
quality of care discourses and the instruments of govern-
ance that have arisen in their wake [23]. Concern for the
quality of care has become translated into particular bur-
eaucratic processes that seek its assurance through audit.
Emmerich et al. argue that bodies like the Care Quality
Commission (CQC) are therefore predisposed to privilege
what is auditable over what is not. The reflexive nature of
social reality means that institutions that are subject to
such audits respond by prioritising the phenomena that
are measured by ‘quality of care’  instruments. This can
have adverse consequences for quality of care as what is
not, or cannot be, subject to audit and evaluation may be-
come neglected, deprioritised and otherwise compro-
mised; ‘quality of care’ audits can be seen as ‘symbolically
violent’. In a message that resonates with that of Pflueger
[14], the authors do not recommend abandoning the audit
approach entirely. Rather, they suggest that there is an
ethical need to acknowledge the limitations of audit and
work to augment and modulate the ways in which quality
of care is evaluated and subsequently managed.
Stevenson et al. engage with the ethical review of re-
search from the perspective of its quality [24]. In recent
times there has been a growing concern about the way
in which processes and procedures of ethical govern-
ance impact on research, especially qualitative social
science research [25]. The authors begin with what is,
by now, a reasonably familiar point: qualitative research
tends to be poorly received by Research Ethics Commit-
tees (RECs) and IRBs (Institutional Research Boards).
Not only has this observation failed to drive any real
change to the approach taken to ethical review, but the
authors present evidence of a more worrying concern -
that the quality of some types of research may be com-
promised because of the failure to revise the approach
taken to ethics review. Drawing on their own experience
with the UK’s National Research Ethics Service (NRES),
Stevenson et al. argue that the current ‘pre-dictive’ ap-
proach to review fails to recognise one of the key virtues
of a qualitative approach - its fluid or iterative nature,
whereby the research process is responsive to insights
generated as the research proceeds. As such, the review
process impacts negatively on the quality of qualitative
research. The authors do not call for an end to ethical
review but suggest an alternative approach which they
call ‘iterative ethics’.  This would, they argue, allow
researchers to engage with review committees without
compromising the integrity of qualitative research or
the ethical relationship between researchers and research 
participants. In short, Stevenson et al. identify an urgent
need to reflect critically on the ethics of ethical review.
Wintrup also draws our attention to an important prob-
lem which is not usually addressed in ethics education for
clinicians. She is critical of the tendency of training courses
to focus on solving problems, with insufficient attention
paid to the complex, ‘contested arenas’ or broader ‘imper-
fect’ socio-political contexts in which ethical problems in
healthcare occur [26]. Wintrup recommends that we reject
the tendency to simplify cases, instead embracing the ‘case’
as a complex, socially situated and constructed phenomena,
influenced by broader structural conditions and macro pol-
itical arrangements of power and influence. She urges edu-
cators to embrace these issues and suggests that in doing
so healthcare professionals will become more inclined to
consider and engage with the ethico-political questions
raised by the provision of health care. This, she suggests
will contribute to securing a quality healthcare service for
the future.
In the final paper within this theme, author Iona
Heath opens with the challenging and thought-provoking
statement that quality is a contemporary catchword “that
seldom has real substance and all too often become a
slogan for the exercise of power” [27]. Quality assurance
and evaluation, she argues, have become an irresistible
machine that bends practice to its will. This machine
absorbs the time, attention and resources of frontline
practitioners and does so largely in the interests of con-
formity and standardization, objectifying both patient
and doctor and ignoring all that is unique in their
human subjectivity. For example, Heath points out that
the Quality and Outcomes Framework applied to UK
General Practice is designed on the basis of average or
‘standardized’ patients, and constructed on the basis of
populations without co-morbidities or other complicat-
ing factors, a model which she suggests is, at best, in-
appropriate. Like several other authors in this collection
she is also critical of over-reliance of quality assessment
on quantitative data: “numbers have taken the place of
words” as our understanding of quality has been re-
stricted by our preference for quantification. She ends
on a salutary note: “we waste effort, money and time
collecting data and pursuing quality targets so that we
have less time to listen and we risk losing sight of the
human suffering subject”.
Moving beyond the quality paradox
In common with other ‘wicked’ problems [12] there is no
single simple solution to the ‘quality’ of healthcare conun-
drum. However, the clear message from this collection is
that the assumptions which underpin many, if not most,
current approaches to managing the ‘quality’ of healthcare
lie open to contest. How quality is often imagined in the
minds of health policy makers and practitioners is not – it

would seem - how it comes to be. Several of the papers in
this collection offer promising suggestions for more con-
structive approaches to improving the ‘quality’ of care pro-
viding some glimpses of possible alternative practices. They
challenge us to be more imaginative in how we ‘measure’
quality and more committed to seeing any such ‘measure-
ment’  as a starting point in the project of characterising
care in the context of complex, inherently unpredictable
environments populated by unique individuals with unique
needs [23,24,27]. Suggestions that arise from this collection
include fostering a ‘skeptical calculative culture’  [14], and
giving more explicit consideration to what measurement
practices such as audit are capable of revealing, concealing
and producing [14,23], and triangulating different forms of
data, deliberately seeking out connections and disconnec-
tions between them [14,22]. We are reminded that quality
of care involves arrangements of people, practices and
materialities that go beyond the patient-clinician dyad
[13,15,16,22], and that standards of care quality must be
rooted in the lived experience of patients, their carers, cli-
nicians and managers [16-18,21,22], rather than on impo-
verished proxy representations. Finally, there is a moral
imperative to ensure that professional education embraces
the morally complex, messy realities of patients’ lives and
socio-political contexts within which patients and practi-
tioners interact [20,26,27].
We would like to express our grateful thanks to the edi-
tors of the six participating journals at BioMed Central
(BMC Medicine; BMC Health Services Research; BMC Med-
ical Ethics; BMC Family Practice; BMC Medical Education;
Philosophy, Ethics and Humanities in Medicine) for making
possible this cross-journal special issue by utilising their
Open Access online publishing space. We can think of few
other platforms that would bring together such an eclectic
group of papers, and hope that this project may sow a seed
for similar publishing ventures that connect otherwise dis-
persed and seemingly ‘unconnected’ facets of wide ranging
topics such as ‘quality’ in healthcare.
