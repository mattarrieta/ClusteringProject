Abstract
Background: Decision-making is reported to be impaired in anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), but
the influence of mood status, pathophysiological eating, and weight concerns on the performance of decision-making
ability between AN and BN is still unclear. The aims of this study were to investigate differential impairments in the
decision-making process between AN, BN, and healthy controls (HC), and secondly, to explore the role of mood status,
such as anxiety, depression, pathological eating, and weight concerns, in decision-making ability.
Methods: Patients suffering from AN (n = 22), BN (n = 36) and age-matched HC (n = 51) were assessed for their
decision-making abilities using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Self-reported questionnaires including the Eating
Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), the Bulimia Investigatory Test, Edinburgh (BITE), the Eating Disorders
Inventory, the Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory measuring obsessive-compulsive traits, the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Toronto Alexithymia Scale were used to assess pathological eating concerns
and attitude to feelings.
Results: Significant differences in IGT performance were observed between BN and HC. Significant negative correlation
was found between IGT performance and the BITE symptom subscale in AN. In BN, there was a negative correlation
between the EDE-Q weight concerns subscale and IGT performance. It was also found that increased anxiety,
depression, and eating/weight concerns predicted poorer decision-making.
Conclusion: Different patterns of association between pathological eating concerns/behaviors and performances
in decision-making ability were found between AN, BN, and HC. Anxiety, depressive mood status, and eating/weight
concerns were related to decision-making ability.

Background
Eating disorders (EDs) are severe and enduring psychiatric
disorders of eating behavior, including extreme, unhealthy
decreases in food intake as well as severe overeating, ac-
companied by feelings of distress or excessive concern
about body shape or weight [1]. Three types of eating dis-
orders are recognized by the text revision of the fourth
edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) [2]: anorexia nervosa (AN), bu-
limia nervosa (BN), and eating disorder not otherwise spe-
cified (EDNOS).
Decision-making is affected by the combination of emo-
tional representations, sensitivity to immediate reward and
long-term outcome according to the somatic marker
hypothesis (SMH) [3-5].  Multiple cognitive functions
such as attention, memory, learning [6,7],  risk-taking,
and obsessive-compulsive traits [8] have been suggested
as being involved in performances in decision-making
[9,10]. A previous study by Tchanturia et al. found im-
pairment of emotional signal by skin conductance (SCR),
showing the lowest emotional signal by demonstrating a
lack of ability to be aware of emotional signal during
decision-making task [11]. In BN, a previous study showed
no significant correlation between SCR and performance
in decision-making [12].  For this reason, it is unclear
whether the AN and BN groups have different deficits in
emotional skills during decision-making.
The role of emotion, specifically anxiety or worry, may
influence the decision-making process [13]. High levels
of worry may have expected consequences of future events
that influence the performances of decision-making [14].
The majority of people with EDs have high levels of anxiety
[15], worry, a defining cognitive feature, and a mainten-
ance factor of anticipatory anxiety [16].  Heightened
anxiety levels may affect the process of decision-making in
AN or BN patients. However, few studies have focused
on the effect of mood status on a prospect during the
decision-making process in AN compared with BN. Two
studies showed that decision-making in patients with AN
may be related to anxiety [17,18], whereas other studies
showed that they were unrelated [7,19].  Some studies
suggested significant associations between measures of
depressive disorder and decision-making [20,21], but a
number of other studies have indicated that depressive
symptoms did not significantly influence decision-making
ability in patients with EDs [7,12,22-24].
Alexithymia is commonly described as consisting of four
features: (1) difficulty identifying and describing subjective
feelings; (2) difficulty distinguishing between feelings and
the bodily sensations of emotional arousal; (3) lack of fan-
tasy; and (4) an externally orientated cognitive style [25].
Previous studies demonstrated that patients with EDs
use maladaptive eating behaviors (e.g., binging, purging,
or dietary restriction) as a way to avoid or cope with 
their emotions [26,27], with many clinical studies suggest-
ing that eating disorder symptoms are associated with
emotional dysfunction [28,29], with clear functional links
expressed between emotional states and both bulimic and
restrictive pathology. It has been suggested that patients
with EDs tend to show alexithymia, but only one study
has examined the relation in EDs in comparison with
healthy controls (HC), showing that alexithymia was unre-
lated to decision-making in AN [30].
The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is a neuropsychological
task that tests the decision-making ability to sacrifice im-
mediate rewards in order to achieve long-term gain [3].
IGT assesses set-shifting ability, reaction to reward and
punishment, and learning ability to decide advantageous
over disadvantageous choice under uncertainty [31]. IGT
is underpinned by SMH, a theory that, in essence, posits
that decision-making under uncertainties is guided by
emotional responses to anticipated positive and nega-
tive consequences [5,6]. Neuroimaging findings suggest
that activation of the mesolimbic pathway during wins
and decreased activation of the inferior frontal gyrus
during losses lead to repeated selections in reward and
punishment in IGT [32]. IGT was developed for func-
tional assessment, given that patients with ventromedial
prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and limbic system dysfunc-
tion show severe impairments in decision-making.
Increasing evidence suggests neuropsychological traits
such as poor set-shifting ability [19], weak central coher-
ence [19,33], a dysfunction of the reward circuit, including
a preference for immediate reward despite long-term ad-
verse consequences [15], higher sensitivity to punishment
[34], and poor insight into illness [35,36] in AN. In previ-
ous studies, memory function [37], skin conductance re-
sponse [11], body mass index (BMI) [38], anxious mood
[18] and impaired decision-making ability were indicated
in AN. Regarding the domain of decision-making ability,
several studies have reported that individuals with AN
show impaired decision-making ability as reflected by
poorer performance on IGT [11,22,39-41].
In BN, decision-making ability was impaired in some
studies [12,22,41], showing that obsessive-compulsive traits
[42] and pathological eating symptoms may be related to
impaired decision-making ability, which in turn may lead
to real-life risk-taking and immediate reward-seeking be-
havior such as binge eating and purging.
Thus, in total, relatively few studies have been conducted
concerning the decision-making ability between AN, BN
and HC [12,37,43,44]. In addition, it has remained unclear
whether the performances of decision-making are distin-
guished by pathological eating concerns/behaviors, mood
status (anxiety, depression), and attitude to feelings such as
alexithymia between AN, BN, and HC.
The hypotheses of this study were: 1) decision-making
performances can be distinguished in AN, BN and HC,
Page 3
Matsumoto et al. Journal of Eating Disorders (2015) 3:14  Page 3 of 10
and 2) decision-making deficits are related to mood sta-
tus such as anxiety, depression, alexithymia, and patho-
logical eating symptoms.
The aims of this study were to investigate differential
impairments in the decision-making process between AN,
BN, and HC, and secondly, to explore the role of mood
status such as anxiety, depression, attitudes to feelings,
and pathological weight concerns in decision-making
ability.
Methods
Participants
The patients of this study were 58 females recruited from
Chiba University Hospital, Japan (22 AN; 36 BN).  They
were interviewed by a senior psychiatrist assessing criteria
for AN and BN as defined by DSM-IV [2]. In addition, the 
M.I.N.I. International Neuropsychiatric Interview translated
into Japanese (M.I.N.I.) [45] was applied. Exclusion criteria
for patients with AN and BN were a history of brain injury,
epilepsy, psychosis or drug dependence. The AN group in-
cluded restrictive (n = 9) and binge eating/purging (n = 13)
subtypes. The BN group included purging (n = 34) and
non-purging (n = 2) subtypes. A total of 7 females (2 AN
and 5 BN) had the following comorbidities: dysthymia (5%;
3 with BN), panic disorder (2%; 1 with BN), somatoform
disorder (2%; 1 with AN), anxiety disorder (2%; 1 with AN),
and alcohol dependence (2%;  1 with BN).  Seventeen
percent of all patients were taking serotonergic drugs
(SSRIs) (Table 1).
HC (n = 51) were recruited through local advertisements
and a website from a potential pool of university students
and volunteers. Age-matched HC underwent an interview

by a senior psychiatrist using M.I.N.I. [45], and they were
determined to have no family history of psychiatric condi-
tions, history of brain injury, epilepsy, psychosis, current
substance abuse or dependence, risk of suicide, mental
retardation, autistic spectrum disorders, comorbid de-
pression and bipolar disorders, and that their BMI
(body mass index) was between 19 and 25 kg/m2.
Procedures
All participants, female native Japanese speakers, were
between age 18 and 38 (mean = 24.92, SD = 5.83 years).
After the study had been described to the participants,
their written informed consent was obtained. The ethics
committee of the Chiba University Graduate School of
Medicine approved the study protocol.
Measurements
Instruments
Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20)
The Toronto Alexithymia Scale [46,47], Japanese version
with established validity and reliability [48], is a 20-item
self report questionnaire measuring alexithymia. It includes
three subscales: difficulty identifying feelings, difficulty de-
scribing feelings, and externally oriented (concrete) think-
ing. Cut-off scores for TAS-20 are equal to or less than 51
for non-alexithymic individuals, and equal to or greater
than 61 for alexithymia. Scores of 52–60 indicate possible
alexithymia.
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)
The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [49], Japanese
version established as valid and reliable [50], is a widely
used self-report scale developed to detect states of depres-
sion, anxiety and emotional distress among patients being
treated for a variety of clinical problems. The scale con-
sists of eight questions assessing depression (HADS-d)
and eight assessing anxiety (HADS-a). The optimal cut-off
point is said to be greater than or equal to 8 for the identi-
fication of suspicious cases and greater than or equal to 11
for safe cases on both subscales [49].
Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q)
The Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire [35],
Japanese version, which was established for its validity as
well as reliability [51], is a widely used 36-item self-report
questionnaire that assesses the eating disorders-related
level of symptoms over the past 28 days. EDE-Q generates
two types of data. First, 22 scaled items plus one unscaled
item (items 1–15 and 29–36) provide subscale scores
reflecting the severity of aspects of the ED psychopath-
ology. Second, 13 more items (items 16–28) provide data
on six key behavioral features of ED in terms of presence/
absence and frequency with which the behavior occurred, 
and loss of control. EDE-Q includes four subscale scores,
Restricting (EDE-Qr),  Eating concern (EDE-Qe),  Shape
concern (EDE-Qs) and Weight Concern (EDE-Qw), which
are included in this assessment, the response format of
which is a 7-point Likert-type scale (0: never; 6: every
day). The subscale scores are obtained by calculating the
average of the items forming each subscale, and the global
score (EDE-Qg) is the average of the four subscale scores.
Bulimia Investigatory Test, Edinburgh (BITE)
The Bulimia Investigatory Test, Edinburgh [52,53], Japanese
version, recognized for its validity and reliability [54],  is
a 33-item self-report measure designed to identify indi-
viduals with symptoms of bulimia or binge eating. BITE
consists of two subscales: the symptom scale (BITE-sas),
which measures the degree of symptoms present, and the
severity scale (BITE-ss),  which provides an index of the
severity of binging and purging behavior as defined by their
frequency.
Eating Disorders Inventory-2 (EDI-2)
The Eating Disorder Inventory-2 contains 91 items and
is a self-report questionnaire designed for use with those
aged 12 years or older. This measure assesses features
commonly associated with anorexia nervosa and bulimia
nervosa but does not provide diagnoses for eating disor-
ders [55]. EDI-2 consists of 11 subscales including bulimia,
body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, perfectionism, inef-
fectiveness, interpersonal distrust, interoceptive awareness,
maturity fears, asceticism, impulse regulation and social in-
security. The Japanese version of EDI-2, which has been
established as valid and reliable [56], was used to assess the
presence of eating disorders.
Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory (MOCI)
The Maudsley Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory [57],
Japanese version, recognized as being valid and reliable
[58], is a true-false format self-report questionnaire de-
veloped for evaluating obsessive-compulsive symptoms
to discriminate obsessive patients from other neurotic
patients and nonclinical individuals. The test is composed
of 30 dichotomous items, such that the total score for a
participant will range between 0 (absence of symptoms)
and 30 (maximum presence of symptoms).
The levels of psychopathology in eating disorders
were measured using the scores of BITE, total scores of
EDI-2, and EDE-Q subscores.
Neuropsychological assessment
Iowa gambling task [3,59]
Decision-making ability of participants was evaluated using
IGT, which is a neuropsychological task based on emotion-
guided evaluation. Participants are required to choose one
card at a time from four available decks of cards (100 trials)
Page 5
Matsumoto et al. Journal of Eating Disorders (2015) 3:14  Page 5 of 10
in this task. The goal of the task is to win as much money
as possible. To accomplish a task, participants have to
detect, from a long-term perspective, which are the most
advantageous decks. First, participants were given both the
task instructions and 200,000 Japanese yen (approximately
US$1,666) of play money. Each time participants choose a
card, they will win some money; however, on turning over
each card they also will, seldom or sometimes, have to
pay a penalty according to a pre-programmed schedule
of reward and punishment. Gains and losses differ for
each card selected from the four decks. Decks A and B
are “bad decks (disadvantageous)”, and the other decks,
C and D, are “good decks (advantageous)”, because, in
the former, while participants receive 10,000 Japanese
yen (approximately US$83),  the losses are also higher,
such that these decks cost more in the long run. In
contrast, the latter will lead to overall gains in the long
run (receiving less money, but punishments are also
smaller). The 100 choices were divided into five blocks
of 20 choices each. We calculated the number of advan-
tageous cards (decks C and D) selected in total.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 21.0
(IBM Corp.,  Armonk, NY).  Demographic and clinical
variables for ED and HC groups were compared using
one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs).
IGT scores were defined as the number of choices
from the advantageous decks (C and D) minus the number
of choices from the disadvantageous decks (A and B) for
all 100 trials. This net score (decks[C + D] - decks[A + B])
calculated for each 20-choice time block enables the as-
sessment of learning during the task. A total net score for
the 100 selections is also calculated. A score of <10 was
established by Bechara et al. as the threshold for deficit of
decision-making on IGT, given the maximum net score
achieved by vmPFC patients was <10 [9]. A 5 × 3 repeated-
measures ANOVA was carried out with the net scores of
the five blocks [C + D]-[A + B](1–20, 21–40, 41–60, 61–80,
81–100) as the repeated-measures variable and the three
diagnostic groups (AN, BN, and HC) as a between-subjects
variable. Effect size was calculated using Cohen’s d, with
d = 0.2 regarded as a small effect, d = 0.5 as a medium ef-
fect, and d = 0.8 as a large effect [60]. Pearson’s correla-
tions were used to examine the relationship between IGT
performance and demographic and clinical variables in
the whole sample and in each group, respectively. Finally,
multiple regression analysis was performed for all partici-
pants to detect the best predictors of IGT performance,
using IGT performance as the dependent variable and all
questionnaire scores and subscale scores showing signifi-
cant relationships as independent variables. In all analyses,
the statistical significance level was set at p < 0.05 (2-tailed
tests). 
Results
Sample characteristics
Demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized
in Table 1. The three groups did not differ in terms of
age (F (2,106) = 1.71; p =0.19) and education (F (2, 65) =
1.24; p = 0.30). In addition, no significant difference be-
tween the patient groups in terms of illness duration
was found (F (1, 52) = 0.003; p < 0.096).  On the other
hand, significant differences were obtained for BMI and
clinical self-report measures (TAS-20, EDE-Q, HADS,
BITE, MOCI, and EDI-2). Post hoc t tests revealed that
AN and/or BN differed from HC for most of the dimen-
sional assessments, while no significant differences were
found with respect to the overall questionnaires between
AN and BN.
Decision-making performances
Group comparisons in IGT total net scores [C + D]-[A + B](1–
100 choices)
Results from IGT are presented in Table 2. The preva-
lence of decision-making impairment (IGT < 10, [9]) was
approximately 45% in AN, 44% in BN patients, and 45%
in HC. No significant group differences were found in
the mean IGT total net scores (F (2,103) = 1.06; p = 0.35),
indicating that the decision-making abilities of the three
groups were quite similar.
Group comparisons in IGT block net scores [C + D]-[A + B]
(1–20, 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, 81–100)
Figure 1 shows the mean IGT scores for the three
groups over the five blocks of 20 trials each. A 5 (IGT
block) × 3 (group) repeated measures ANOVA was per-
formed on net scores for all five blocks. Mauchly’s test in-
dicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated
(χ2 (9) = 51.51, p < 0.0001),  and therefore the degrees of
freedom were corrected using Greenhouse-Geisser esti-
mates of sphericity (ε = 0.78). There was no significant
main effect of group (F (2, 103) = 1.06, p = 0.35, ηp2 =
0.02), but there was a significant main effect of block (F
(3.14, 57.48) = 14.53, p < 0.0001, ηp2 = 0.12), and a sig-
nificant group × block interaction (F (6.28, 57.48) =
2.63, p = 0.02, ηp2 = 0.05) over the IGT blocks. In the
HC group, IGT performance showed a gradual increase
across blocks. There was a significant task-related learning
effect, as performance improved during the task for BN
and HC (BN: F (4, 32) = 2.69; p = 0.04; HC: F (4, 47) =
15.24; p < 0.0001). A post-hoc least significant difference
test indicated that there was a significant difference be-
tween the BN and HC groups in the final block [C + D]-
[A + B](81–100), that is, performance in BN was signifi-
cantly worse than in HC (p = 0.02). On the other hand,
although no significant difference was observed between
AN and HC in the final block [C + D]-[A + B](81–100),
performance in AN was marginally deficient compared to

sizes for between-groups differences in IGT net scores
were measured using Cohen’s d (block 1: AN vs. HC,
d = 0.20; BN vs. HC, d = 0.11; block 2: AN vs. HC, d =

Group comparisons controlling for covariates
We demonstrated the same group comparisons analysis,
controlling for the use of SSRIs in the IGT block net
scores [C + D]-[A + B](1–20, 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, 81–100).
We not only detected remaining significant differences in
the IGT net scores in the final [C + D]-[A + B](81–100)
choices (p = 0.01), but also found significant differences
between BN and HC in the fourth [C + D]-[A + B](61–80)
choices (p = 0.01).

Association between decision-making and clinical
variables
Correlation analysis
We explored correlations among clinical measures in-
cluding all scores such as TAS-20, EDE-Q, BITE, EDI-2,
HADS, MOCI and IGT performance (both IGT total net
scores: [C + D]-[A + B](1–100 choices) and block net
scores: [C + D]-[A + B](1–20, 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, 81–
100) ) in AN and BN females, respectively. Performance
in the first block [C + D]-[A + B](1–20) of the IGT was
negatively associated with BITE-sas in the AN group
(r = −0.73, p = 0.04) (Figure 2). In the BN group, as shown
in Figure 3, the IGT performance in the third block [C +
D]-[A + B](41–60) was also negatively correlated with
EDEQ-w (r = −0.47, p = 0.02). Therefore, we detected dif-
ferent patterns of association between pathological eating
concerns/behaviors and the performances of decision-
making ability between AN and BN.
Regression analysis
Multiple regression analysis was performed for all partici-
pants using demographic and clinical scores such as TAS-
20, EDE-Q (four subscales: restricting, eating concern,
shape concern, weight concern), HADS (depression and
anxiety), EDI-2, MOCI, and BITE (symptoms and severity)
as independent variables and IGT net scores [C + D]-[A +
B] (1–20, 21–40, 41–60, 61–80, 81–100) as dependent
variables. As shown in Table 3, the analyses revealed seven
predictive factors for the third block of IGT [C + D]-[A +
B](41–60):  years of education (β = 0.77, p = 0.0001),
EDEQ-r (β = 1.58, p = 0.0001), HADS-a (β = −0.69, p =
0.01), HADS-d (β = 1.44, p = 0.0001), EDI-2 (β = −0.81,
p = 0.01),  BITE-ss (β = −0.51, p = 0.03),  and BITE-sas
(β = −1.80, p = 0.0001). In contrast, no significant predict-
ive factor was highlighted for the AN and BN groups,
suggesting that mood status (anxiety or depression), in
addition to the pathological eating/weight concerns for
the prospect of decision-making were detected.

Discussion
In the present study, we found different profiles in IGT
performance between BN, AN, and HC. As shown in
Figure 1, a comparison of the performance curves of
the three groups revealed that the individuals with AN
and BN, as opposed to HC, failed to learn advantageous
decision-making until the end of the task. Although no
significant difference between AN and HC was observed,
a difference between BN and HC (BN < HC, p = 0.02)
was detected in the final block [C + D]-[A + B](81–100).
Regarding total net scores, the prevalence of decision-
making impairment (IGT < 10) was reported to be ap-
proximately 61% in AN and 77% in BN by Brogan et al.
[44], but our data showed lower percentages. Secondly,
only in the BN group, there was a significant negative cor-
relation between the weight concern subscales and the
performances of decision-making ability. These findings
may be strongly confirmed by the fact that in the BN
group, pathological weight concern affected the impaired
decision-making ability.
A previous study has reported that patients with BN
were significantly different from the HC group in blocks

3 [C + D]-[A + B](41–60) and 4 [C + D]-[A + B](61–80)
[44]. In contrast, we found that BN made fewer advanta-
geous choices than HC in the final block [C + D]-[A + B]
(81–100) of the task. This would suggest that pathological
concerns affect ignored long-term negative consequences,
which may have led to impaired decision-making ability in
the final block [C + D]-[A + B](81–100) in the current
study. There is a striking resemblance between the IGT
performance of the patients and their real-life pathological
behaviors, in which they have a tendency to reduce their
food intake and/or refuse to eat, or in contrast to this
pattern, repetitively overeating and purging, ignoring
long-term negative consequences. In a previous study,
BN subjects failed to learn an advantageous decision-
making strategy by choosing immediate rewards (high
gains) despite the long-term negative consequences (loss
of money) as compared to HC, showing that sensitivity to
gains affect these findings [23], results consistent with
the current study. Boeka and Lokken [22] suggested that
there are links between decision-making, weight, and eating
concerns/restricting behavior in BN, and thus the authors
argued that the severity of bulimic symptoms as measured
by the Bulimia Test-Revised [61] and the severity of EDE-Q
(restraint, eating concerns and weight concerns) contribute
to decision-making ability. These data were consistent with
the findings in the BN group in the current study. Brand
et al. suggested that performance in decision-making was
related to executive functioning but not to other neuro-
psychological functions, personality, or disease-specific
variables in the BN group [41]. Regarding the task, in
comparison to HC, the patients with BN tended to
choose disadvantageous alternatives more frequently,
possibly due to a tendency to fail to learn from the an-
terior half of the task, which might be linked to real-life
pathological behaviors.
On the other hand, although performance in AN was
marginally deficient compared to HC (p = 0.05) in the
Page 8
Matsumoto et al. Journal of Eating Disorders (2015) 3:14  Page 8 of 10
last trial [C + D]-[A + B](81–100) of the IGT, the current
study does not support results from other studies
[11,39,40], showing that AN patients failed to reach a
significant difference in decision-making compared to
HC. One explanation for this is the small sample size
of the current study. Additionally, the fewer comorbidities
(AN, 2 with comorbidities; BN, 5 comorbidities) in AN
might have led to better decision-making compared to
BN. Interestingly, in the AN group, there was a significant
correlation between bulimic symptomatology measured
by the BITE symptom subscale, which measures the de-
gree of present symptoms, and the poor performance
of IGT in the first block [C + D]-[A + B](1–20). 59.1%
(13/22) of the AN group had binge eating/purging sub-
type, which may have affected the poor performance of
IGT. Thus, our first hypothesis, that the AN and BN
groups present a different pattern in decision-making
ability, was confirmed.
The second aim of this study was to explore the links
between decision-making ability and mood status, weight/
eating concerns of pathological symptoms. Using multiple
regression analysis, we found that EDI-2 and BITE-ss
measures predicted decision-making. These data are in
line with previous investigations concerning this subject
[18,22].
Both the states of anxiety and depressive mood were
found to be predictors of better decision-making. These
data suggest that emotional states may impact decision-
making in EDs [11] as well as in HC [62-64].  Zeeck
et al. reported that the urge to eat is significantly higher
under negative-emotional states; negative emotions such
as sadness or disappointment correlated significantly with
the number of binges, whereas positive emotions did not
[65]. Thereby, the ‘Network Theory of Affect’ [66], that
is, affective nodes (central units), can be semantic (with
straightforward meaning) or affective (with emotional
meaning), which may confirm the findings of the previ-
ous study. One recent study of binge eating disorders
was in line with this view, proposing that the emotional
state may have a direct experience that is similar to its
emotion [67].
Alexithymia, as measured by TAS-20, did not affect
decision-making ability in the current study, although a
higher level of alexithymia compared with HC was observed.
Miyake et al. reported that there was no correlation
with decision-making ability using emotional decision-
making task and alexithymia in EDs [30], a result con-
sistent with the finding of our study.
In the current study, controlling for the use of SSRIs
as covariance, we detected significant difference in IGT
performances between BN and HC in the fourth block
[C + D]-[A + B](61–80) and the final block [C + D]-[A + B]
(81–100),  which suggested the influence of the sero-
tonin system in decision-making. In the previous study 
by Tchanturia et al. [11], 44% of AN patients were taking
SSRIs, but no difference between medicated and non-
medicated patients was found. Emerging data have sug-
gested that dysregulation of serotonin circuits in cortical
and limbic structures are related to anxiety, eating behav-
iors and body image symptoms [68]. Alterations of this
system may influence mood status and decision-making
process in EDs, which may lead to insights into potential
treatment approaches. The question of whether cognitive
impairment in EDs is an endophenotype and risk factor or
whether it is a correlate of illness remains unclear from
the findings in the current study. It may be suggested that
the relationship of symptomatology and emotional func-
tioning to decision-making performance improves with
recovery of illness.
There are some limitations to this study. First, it should
be noted that a single task such as IGT is limited in exam-
ining decision-making impairments comprehensively, and
this is true for the other clinical scales as well. Second, the
results are generalizable for females only, and the sample
sizes were not large enough compared to previous studies
[12,37,43,44],  indicating that a replication with a larger
group that includes males is desirable. Finally, other
variables such as impulsivity, central coherence, set-shifting,
and inhibitory control-confounding factors associated with
decision-making deficits or emotional dysregulation should
be considered in the future.
Future study should evaluate how some different emo-
tional variables such as sadness and fear may influence
the decision-making process in patients with EDs. A longi-
tudinal study is required to investigate changes in decision-
making ability in accordance with emotional states and
recovery of symptomatology of illness.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we found different profiles in IGT perform-
ance between BN, AN, and HC. Different patterns of asso-
ciation between pathological eating concerns/behaviors
and the performances of decision-making ability were
found between AN, BN, and HC. Individuals with BN,
compared to HC, have a different processing pattern of
decision-making ability that may be linked to pathological
eating/weight concerns. Anxiety, depressive mood status,
and pathological eating/weight concerns are linked to
decision-making ability.
