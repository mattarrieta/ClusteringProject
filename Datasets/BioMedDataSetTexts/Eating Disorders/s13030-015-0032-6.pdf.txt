Relationship between duration of illness and
cardiac autonomic nervous activity in anorexia
nervosa

Abstract
Background: The mortality rate associated with anorexia nervosa (AN) is high, and death is mainly attributable to
cardiac events. A wide range of autonomic nervous system disturbances may be mechanisms underlying the
increased cardiovascular mortality and sudden death of patients with AN. Heart rate variability (HRV) has been
proven to be a reliable noninvasive method for quantitative assessment of sympathetic and parasympathetic
regulation of heart rate (HR). The longer the duration of illness of AN patients, the higher the mortality rate.
However, there have been few reports on the relationship between the duration of illness and HRV in AN. Hence,
the aims of this study were to compare the cardiac autonomic nervous activity (CANA) of female patients with AN
and age-matched female controls and to evaluate the relationship between the duration of illness and the CANA of
the AN patients.
Methods: We studied 14 female patients with AN and 22 age-matched healthy women. Beat-to-beat heart rate
variability, recorded in a supine position, was investigated using power spectral analysis.
Result: Mean heart rate was positively correlated with normalized high-frequency (HF: 0.15 to 0.40 Hz) power and
negatively correlated with the low-frequency (LF: 0.04 to 0.15 Hz)/HF power (LF/HF) ratio of the controls. On the
other hand, duration of illness was negatively correlated with normalized HF power and positively correlated with
the LF/HF ratio of the AN patients.
Conclusions: These results suggest that, given that the LF/HF ratio is an estimate of cardiac sympathovagal
balance, anorectic patients with a long illness duration display lower vagal tone (parasympathetic withdrawal) and
high sympathetic tone.

Background
Although once believed to be a problem primarily limited
to female Caucasians, individuals from a variety of racial
and ethnic groups are affected by eating disorders [1]. Al-
though “Fushoku-byou”, a form of anorexia nervosa (AN),
had been described by physicians of Oriental medicine
during the last quarter of the 18th century, modern study
of AN in Japan dates from the end of the 1950s. The
number of patients with eating disorders in clinical and

community samples has increased dramatically in Japan
since the 1980s [2,3]. This is an important social health
concern in Japan [2], as in Western countries [1].
The mortality rate associated with AN is high (5.9%-
18%), and death is mainly attributable to cardiac events
in Western countries [4].  When we conducted an out-
come study in 233 Japanese women with an eating dis-
order, followed from 4 to 9 years, 14 (10.2%) of 137
anorectic patients had died before follow-up due to car-
diac events (n = 10), pneumonia (n = 1), sepsis (n = 1), mul-
tiple organ failure syndrome (n = 1), and suicide (n = 1)
[5]. Individuals with AN demonstrate cardiac structural
(decreased left ventricular mass and wall thickness),

functional (left ventricle dysfunction), and electrical prob-
lems (prolonged QT interval and bradycardia) [6]. A wide
range of autonomic nervous system (ANS) disturbances
may be mechanisms underlying the increased cardiovas-
cular mortality and sudden death of patients with AN [7].
Heart rate variability (HRV) has been proven to be a
reliable noninvasive method for quantitative assessment
of sympathetic and parasympathetic regulation of heart
rate (HR) in different study populations. Mazurak et al.
[7] conducted a review of the literature on HRV as a
measure of cardiac autonomic function in AN. Twenty
papers on HRV in patients with AN were identified and
analyzed, revealing three distinct viewpoints regarding
changes of ANS functions in patients with AN. The
majority of papers identified sympathetic/parasympa-
thetic imbalance with parasympathetic dominance and
decreased sympathetic modulation; others could not
replicate these findings, but instead described sympa-
thetic dominance; finally, a group of papers could not
identify any autonomic functional differences in com-
parison to control samples.
Our outcome study revealed that the longer the dur-
ation of illness of AN patients, the higher the mortality
rate [8]. However, there have been few reports on the re-
lationship between the duration of illness and HRV in
AN [6,9]. DiVasta et al. [6] reported that anorectic pa-
tients with higher heart rates at admission had a longer
duration of illness. However, they did not study the HRV
of these patients. In a study by Wu et al. [9], there was
no significant difference in heart rate between AN pa-
tients and controls, but AN patients, who suffered from
long term malnutrition, showed a lower sympathetic ac-
tivity and a higher parasympathetic activity. However,
they did not describe the range of the duration of illness
of these patients [9].
Hence, the aims of this study were to compare the
cardiac autonomic nervous activity (CANA) of female
AN patients, with a wide range of duration of illness,
and age-matched female controls and to evaluate the rela-
tionship between the duration of illness and the CANA of
AN patients.
Methods
Participants
We studied 14 women referred to Kyoto University Hos-
pital in 2005 who met the DSM-IV criteria [10] for the
restricting type of AN. Patients having anxiety disorders
and/or emotional disorders were excluded from this study.
The duration of illness ranged from 6 to 321 months.
Twenty-two age-matched female controls were recruited
by public notices at the university center. Interested indi-
viduals were screened with a diagnostic checklist by a se-
nior author (YN) to ensure that they did not meet the
criteria for a current Axis I disorder and did not report 
any history of eating disorders or cardiovascular diseases.
Ten controls had a low BMI, less than 18.5 kg/m2, and
twelve had a normal BMI, 18.5 to 25.0 kg/m2. There was
no significant difference in age, HR or the results of heart
rate analyses between the two groups; hence, data of the
two groups were combined. Demographic and clinical
data are shown in Table 1. All of the subjects gave their
written informed consent for the study. Ethical approval
for this study was given by the Ethics Committee of Kyoto
University Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine.
Procedure
None of the subjects had taken any medications during
the month prior to testing. All subjects were asked to
refrain from consuming caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco
for at least 24 hours prior to testing. Electrocardiogram
(ECG) recordings were performed for ten minutes in a
supine position after a resting period of 20 min between
10:00 AM and 12:00 AM. Five-minute stationary and
artifact-free sections of ECG recordings were selected.
The heart rate analyses were carried out using a com-
mercially available computer program (SyneTec, Ela
Medical Japan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). There were no
missing values due to artifacts and no form of artifact
correction was employed.
The results of spectral analyses were calculated by fast
Fourier transformation, according to the user’s manual
of SyneTec. Frequency domain measurements included
total power (0.04 to 0.40 Hz), low-frequency power (LF:
0.04 to 0.15 Hz),  and high-frequency power (HF: 0.15
to 0.40 Hz).  Following the recommendations by the
Task Force on HRV Research [11], normalized HF power
(=100 × HF power/total power), normalized LF power
(=100 × LF power/total power), and LF/HF ratio were
calculated. We used normalized HF power as an index
of cardiac parasympathetic activity and LF/HF ratio as an
index of cardiac sympathovagal balance. Higher values of
LF/HF reflect sympathetic dominance or parasympathetic

drawal or parasympathetic dominance.
Statistical analysis
All results are expressed as the mean ± SD. The statis-
tical analysis was performed with SPSS 13.0. Statistical
comparisons between AN patients and controls were
performed by Student’s unpaired t test. Spearman’s cor-
relations were used to evaluate the relationship among
different variables. P < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results
There was no significant difference in age between the
AN patients and controls. However, there were signi-
ficant differences in body mass index (BMI),  systolic
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate,
as shown in Table 1.
There was a significant difference in the mean heart
rate (HR) between AN patients and controls; however,
there was no significant difference in normalized LF
power, normalized HF power, or LF/HF ratio, as shown
in Table 2.
The mean heart rate (HR) of the controls was nega-
tively correlated with normalized HF power and posi-
tively correlated with LF/HF ratio (Table 3).  On the
other hand, duration of illness of the AN patients was
negatively correlated with normalized HF power and posi-
tively correlated with normalized LF power and LF/HF ra-
tio (Table 4). No outliers were found on visual inspection
of the scatter plots of significant correlations, with the ex-
ception of one in a scatter plot for the duration of illness
and LF/HF ratio of the AN patients. When this outlier
was removed, the r value changed from 0.784 to 0.763.
Discussion
In the present study, mean HR of the controls was nega-
tively correlated with normalized HF power, an index of
cardiac parasympathetic activity, and positively corre-
lated with LF/HF ratio, an index of cardiac sympatho-
vagal balance. These results suggest that the mean HR

was regulated appropriately by the ANS function of the
controls [11].
On the other hand, the duration of illness of the AN
patients was negatively correlated with normalized HF
power and positively correlated with LF/HF ratio. This
indicates that parasympathetic tone was stronger in AN
patients with a short illness duration. The higher para-
sympathetic tone of AN patients with a short illness dur-
ation could be considered to be an adaptive response to
caloric deprivation, as previously described [7,9,12]. On
the other hand, given that the LF/HF ratio is an estimate
of cardiac sympathovagal balance, AN patients with a
long illness duration displayed lower vagal tone (para-
sympathetic withdrawal) and high sympathetic tone. The
sympathetic/parasympathetic imbalance with sympathe-
tic predominance of AN patients with a long illness dur-
ation could be detrimental and contribute to the higher
cardiovascular mortality risk of these patients. In fact,
increased sympathetic tone has been shown to cause an
increased risk of sudden cardiac death by cardiac failure
[13]. The findings of the present study differ from those
of a previous study. Wu et al. [9] reported that the dur-
ation of illness of AN patients (n = 14) had a significant
negative relationship to normalized LF power, but it had a
significant positive relationship to normalized HF power.
There was no significant relationship between the dur-
ation of illness and the LF/HF ratio of these patients. Since
Wu et al. did not describe the range of duration of illness,

a possible explanation for the discrepancy in the results
between our study and their study may be a difference in
the range of duration of illness.
A limitation of the current study was that our sample
is small and thus limits our ability to detect small effect
sizes for comparisons, owing to the limited statistical
power. This study was cross-sectional rather than longi-
tudinal, so the findings of the duration of illness for
HRV should be interpreted with caution. We should also
have measured the respiration rate to estimate HF power
more precisely.
In summary, the findings of the present study suggest
that, given that the LF/HF ratio is an estimate of cardiac
sympathovagal balance, anorectic patients with a long
illness duration displayed lower vagal tone (parasympa-
thetic withdrawal) and high sympathetic tone.
