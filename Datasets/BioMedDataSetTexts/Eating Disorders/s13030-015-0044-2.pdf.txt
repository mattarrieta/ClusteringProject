Abstract
Background: No epidemiologic survey examining eating disorders in Japan has been done at a national level since
1992. The prevalence of anorexia nervosa, as assessed by questionnaires to hospitals, is thought to be underestimated
because patients with anorexia nervosa tend to avoid consultations. In conformity with the School Health and Safety
Act of Japan, schools are required to have physicians perform a medical examination of students every year. The
teachers in charge of health education and school physicians determine the height, weight, and health condition, and
examine the medical records of each student. Therefore, we as members of the Survey Committee for Eating Disorders
of the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare conducted an epidemiologic survey using questionnaires sent
to schools in seven prefectures to determine the current prevalence of anorexia nervosa among adolescents.
Methods: We sent a questionnaire to elementary, junior high, and senior high schools. Questionnaires contained items
on the number of students, patients with anorexia nervosa in each grade who were diagnosed by specialists, and
students who the school physician strongly suspected to have anorexia nervosa but who did not undergo a clinical
examination in a medical institution.
Results: We found patients of both sexes with anorexia nervosa aged 9–10 years in elementary schools. The point
prevalence of anorexia nervosa for girls, including strongly suspected cases, in the three grades of junior high school
and three grades of senior high school were 0–0.17 %, 0–0.21 %, 0.17-0.40 %, 0.05-0.56 %, 0.17-0.42 % and 0.09-0.43 %,
respectively. We also confirmed a prominent sex difference in the prevalence of anorexia nervosa. The prevalence of
boys was one third that of girls in some prefectures. One third to one half of diagnosed and strongly suspected
students with anorexia nervosa had not received medical consultation or treatment.
Conclusions: Although the prevalence of anorexia nervosa had regional differences in Japan, it has reached levels
comparable to those in Western societies. Because no eating disorder center exists and the treatment environment is
poor, national action to address this disease is a pressing need in Japan.

Background
Anorexia nervosa is associated with various types of
medical morbidity due to malnutrition [1] and a signifi-
cant mortality rate in adolescents [2].  The last survey
performed in Japan at a national level was done in 1992
by the Survey Committee for Eating Disorders of the
Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare who
sent questionnaires to hospitals with 300 or more beds

[3].  The prevalence of anorexia nervosa of female pa-
tients aged 10 to 29 years was 0.025 % to 0.031 %. Based
on a questionnaire sent to hospitals and clinics in
Niigata prefecture, which faces the Sea of Japan and had
the 14th largest population in Japan in 1997, the preva-
lence of anorexia nervosa of female residents aged 15 to
29 years was 0.017 % [4]. In contrast, the prevalence of
anorexia nervosa as assessed by questionnaires returned
by schools was higher than that obtained from medical
facilities [3];  in that study, the prevalences of anorexia
nervosa for the junior and senior high school girls of
Kyoto were 0.24 % and 0.15 %,  respectively. It was

thought that the prevalence obtained based on question-
naires sent to medical facilities might underestimate dis-
ease prevalence because patients with anorexia nervosa
may refuse or not seek consultation [5].
In conformity with the School Health and Safety Act
of Japan, school physicians have to perform a medical
examination for students every year. The teachers in
charge of health education in Japan complete a curricu-
lum for adolescent health and some have a school-nurse
license. Every school has a school physician, whose spe-
cialty is internal medicine, pediatrics, or gynecology. The
teachers in charge of health education and school physi-
cians determine height, weight, and health condition and
review the medical records of each student.
School physicians and teachers in charge of health edu-
cation list students who show poor weight gain, lose
weight in comparison with the last year, or have a body
weight lower than 80 % of the expected body weight in this
annual medical examination. The expected weight of a
child is based on height and indexes prescribed to age and
gender. Growth curves are also drawn to identify growth
retardation. These health care professionals usually see
students with very low weight to identify the clinical char-
acteristics of anorexia nervosa, including amenorrhea,
lanugo, bradycardia, constipation, hypotension, hypother-
mia, and edema, which are described in the diagnostic cri-
teria of The Survey Committee for Eating Disorders of the
Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, and also
ask the students questions according to the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual fourth edition (DSM-IV) criteria. When
a student is a strongly suspected case of anorexia nervosa,
the school physician advises the parents or guardians to
consult with a specialist.
In this study, the Survey Committee performed an epi-
demiologic survey of anorexia nervosa by sending ques-
tionnaires to schools in seven prefectures in Japan to
obtain updated prevalence data.
Methods
A questionnaire was sent to principals and the teachers in
charge of health education at junior and senior high schools
in Tokyo, Hokkaido, Hiroshima, Nagano, Kumamoto,
Yamaguchi, and Miyazaki, which had respective popula-
tion rankings during this survey of 1, 8, 12, 16, 23, 25, and
36 of the 47 Japanese prefectures, and to elementary
schools in six prefectures (same as the above except for
Hokkaido).  Tokyo is the capital of Japan. Hokkaido is
the northernmost prefecture. Nagano is a mountainous
prefecture in the center of the country. Hiroshima and
Yamaguchi are located in the west of Honshu, the main is-
land. Kumamoto and Miyazaki prefectures are located on
the island of Kyushu. The questionnaire gathered back-
ground on each school, and the number of students with
anorexia nervosa, including those with strongly suspected 
anorexia nervosa, in each grade at the time of the survey.
We used the DSM-IV criteria for anorexia nervosa in
addition to the criteria for anorexia nervosa put forth
by the Survey Committee for Eating Disorders of the
Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare (Table 1)
[6]. The build of Japanese is smaller than that of Caucasian.
Based on the DSM-IV criteria, many healthy girls with
regular menstruation who are at 85 % of normal weight are
selected for screening for anorexia nervosa. In this study,
we used a body weight less than 80 % of the ideal body
weight based on the Japanese criteria to identify patients
with anorexia nervosa. In the present study, we may have
overlooked patients with anorexia nervosa who met only
the DSM-IV criteria.
The questionnaire did not ask the teachers in charge
of health education or the school physicians about the
types of anorexia nervosa because they may not always
recognize the binge eating/purging-type without a report
from the student.
Japanese compulsory education begins when children are
six to seven years old. They study for six years at an elem-
entary school and then three years at a junior high school.
The percent of junior high school students who go on to
senior high school in Japan is more than 97 %. Japanese se-
nior high schools use a three-year system. A senior high
school student’s age ranges from 15 to 18 years. We pro-
vided a written explanation of this study to the parents of
the students in each school. Based on the judgment of the
principal, personal data can be provided to a research team
when its goal is to benefit students and the data are pro-
vided anonymously. The study protocol was approved by
the institutional review board of each author. This study
was also carried out with the permission of the Board of
Education in each of the seven prefectures.

Basic Survey by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour
and Welfare, the number of subjects who participated in
this study, the participation rate, and the number of stu-
dents diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, including those
with strongly suspected anorexia nervosa, for each grade.
Participation rates for the questionnaire varied by school
and by prefecture. In Tokyo, elementary and junior high
schools in a limited area participated in the study and
those subjects represented only about 5 % of the total
number of children. Although the Education Bureau of
Tokyo prefecture requested schools to cooperate with
our survey and we sent a collection letter to schools that
did not provide answers, some schools seemed to resist
information disclosure. In contrast, about 60 % of stu-
dents in every grade in Yamaguchi and Kumamoto par-
ticipated in the research. 
We confirmed that anorexia nervosa was predominant
in girls. This is the first study in Japan that examined the
prevalence of anorexia nervosa among children 12 years
old or younger. We found patients of both sexes in the
fourth grade in elementary schools (aged 9–10 years)
with anorexia nervosa. For junior high school girls, the
prevalence increased in a straight line and became high-
est among third-year students. For senior high school
girls, the peak prevalence was observed in the second or
third year in all prefectures except for Hiroshima. The
point prevalences of anorexia nervosa for girls, including
strongly suspected cases in the three grades of junior high
school and three grades of senior high school were
0–0.17 %, 0–0.21 %, 0.17-0.40 %, 0.05-0.56 %, 0.17-0.42 %,
and 0.09-0.43 %, respectively. We also confirmed a prom-
inent sex difference in the prevalence of anorexia nervosa,

with the prevalence of boys one third that of girls in senior
high schools in Yamaguchi. One third to one half of those
diagnosed with anorexia nervosa or with strongly sus-
pected anorexia did not receive medical treatment (data
not shown).
We demonstrated the recent prevalence of anorexia
nervosa, including strongly suspected cases of anorexia
nervosa, among adolescents in seven prefectures in
Japan. We cannot show evidence to explain the regional
differences in the prevalence at the present stage. Al-
though there were regional differences among prefec-
tures, the prevalence of anorexia nervosa in this study
was similar or higher than the rates reported in a previ-
ous epidemiologic study using the same survey method
as the present study [3]. Our report is also the first on
the prevalence of anorexia nervosa among elementary
school children. Because anorexia nervosa before menar-
che can retard growth and lower peak bone mass [7, 8]
preventing this disorder, early detection, early consult-
ation, and communication between parents, physicians,
and schools are pressing needs.
Since the 1960s, eating disorders such as anorexia ner-
vosa began to be recognized as an important health
problem among adolescent girls and young women in
Western societies, and their prevalence has increased
over time [9]. Although the survey methods and ages of
the subjects in other studies differed from those in our
study, the prevalence of anorexia nervosa was shown to
be 0.3 % of young females in the Netherlands [10], 0.5 %
of teenaged girls in Germany [11] 0.3 % of secondary
school students in Hungary [12], and 0.2-0.3 % of girls
aged 13 to 18 years in the United States [13]. Although
it was previously reported that the prevalence of an-
orexia nervosa in Japan is lower than that for European
Caucasian populations [4],  we showed that the preva-
lence among adolescents in Japan is near that of devel-
oped European countries and the United States.
As shown in other studies [14, 15], adolescent girls with
eating disorders often refuse consultations with a phys-
ician, never seek treatment, or are untreated. One third to
one half of the students with anorexia nervosa in the
present study had not consulted physicians. Unfortunately,
there is no eating disorder center in Japan, which leads to
a poor treatment environment. The establishment of an
eating disorder center can contribute at a national level to
education for physicians and paramedical professionals,
research support, and a public awareness campaign on
eating disorders. Medical administration policies should
be considered based on the results of the current study.
Few hospitals employ specialists in eating disorders. These
two factors may contribute to the low consultation rates
found in the present study.
There are several critical limitations to this study. First,
prevalence was estimated using indirect information 
obtained from schools. It is possible that teachers in
charge of health education and school physicians were un-
able to identify milder cases of anorexia nervosa. Second,
only seven prefectures participated. Many prefectural
Boards of Education refused to participate because of the
pressure of additional work, and some schools refused to
participate due to privacy concerns. Third, participation
rates for the questionnaire varied by school and by
prefecture.
Conclusions
In conclusion, medical facilities and treatment environ-
ments conductive to the treatment of for eating dis-
orders need to be developed in Japan because the
prevalence of anorexia nervosa among adolescents in
this survey was similar to that found in European coun-
tries and the United States. It is clear that this health
concern needs to be addressed.
