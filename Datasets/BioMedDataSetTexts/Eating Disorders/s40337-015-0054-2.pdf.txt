Abstract
Background: The aim of the study was to examine disordered eating behaviors in university students in Vietnam.
Methods: A total of 244 female university students participated, and 203 data could be analyzed. The Body Mass
Index, the SCOFF screening questionnaire and the Eating Disorder Inventory 2 were used to explore disordered
eating behaviors.
Results: 45.3% of the participants were underweight, 53.2% were normal weight and 1.5% were overweight. 48.8%
of students reported two or more yes-responses on the SCOFF screening questionnaire which indicates a high
possibility of having eating disorder symptoms. The mean score for underweight subjects (M = 14.79, SD = 6.81)
indicated a lower level on the drive for thinness scale of the EDI-2 compared to normal weight subjects (M = 24.65,
SD = 6.86) and overweight subjects (M = 31.33, SD = 6.66). Additionally, underweight subjects (M = 27.24, SD = 7.57)
were less dissatisfied with their body than normal weight subjects (M = 35.94, SD = 8.67) and overweight subjects
(M = 43.33, SD = 11.24). A significant positive correlation appeared between the BMI and the EDI-2. The SCOFF
questionnaire showed a statistically significant negative correlation with the BMI and the EDI-2.
Conclusions: Despite some limitations the current study shows a tendency in young females in urban
Vietnam to be underweight and to develop disordered eating symptoms such as drive for thinness and body
dissatisfaction. However, more studies using the SCOFF and the EDI-2 would be needed to verify these
findings.

Background
Eating disorders are one of the most relevant mental dis-
orders not only in Western countries but also in non-
Western countries. Recently, reviews have shown that the
prevalence of eating disorders in non-Western countries
is not consistently lower compared to the prevalence in
Western countries [1].  Eating disorders do occur all
around the world [2]. Many important factors influence
the increase in eating disorders worldwide. Some experts
suggested that globalization and internationalization have
brought the beauty ideal and pursuit of thinness, as well
as the value of beauty and social norms of Western cul-
tures to non-Western cultures, societies, and people,
which, in turn, may lead to an increase in the occurrence
of eating disorders [3-5].  Furthermore, some cross-

cultural studies reported on an increase of eating disorders
in non-Western societies, due especially to economic
development, the exposure to Western culture, the higher
socioeconomic status of individuals and so forth [6-8].
Although these studies evinced that eating disorders are
increasing in many non-Western countries, there is
inconsistency in the methods used and some reported re-
sults. The question regarding the factors which are most
likely to cause the development of eating disorders as well
as the difficulties in measuring the current prevalence of
eating disorders in non-Western countries are issues that
must be addressed. More study results are needed, espe-
cially from non-Western countries regarding prevalence
rates and the factors associated with eating disorders in
those countries.
One challenge in evaluating the results of our own study
in Vietnam was the lack of studies that examine eating dis-
orders in this part of the world and are published in

international journals. Tsai [9] reported in his review on the
prevalence of eating disorders in Asian countries that no
studies on Vietnam existed at that time. Very few studies
on body image or obesity have included the Vietnamese as
participants, especially since their economic reform.
Vietnam is one of the fastest developing Asian countries
and is quickly changing culturally and socially. The eco-
nomic growth in Vietnam has rapidly increased since the
economic reform program that was termed Doi Moi [10].
Lifestyles and dietary patterns of the Vietnamese population
have been changing during this economic development
[11].  Additionally, the nutrition conditions have changed
and improved through the national nutrition policies from
1995 to 2000 [10].
After the economic reform and the improvement of
nutrition policies, some national surveys were conducted
and report data regarding the prevalence of obesity and
thinness in the Vietnamese population. For example, the
results described by Tuan et al. [10] from the data of the
Living Standard Survey in 1992 and the National Health
Survey in 2002 showed that the prevalence of obesity and
being overweight generally increased more in urban areas
than in rural areas, and the prevalence of being under-
weight decreased in adults from 1992 to 2002 in Vietnam.
It has also been reported from the data of the National
Nutrition Survey in 2000 and the National Adult Obesity
Survey in 2005 that the prevalence of being overweight or
obese was higher in 2005 as compared to 2000 in both
rural and urban areas, with the highest prevalence in
urban areas [11].  The prevalence of being underweight
was lower in 2005 than in 2000 in both areas, but higher
in rural areas compared to urban areas in both years [11].
Additionally, the higher rates of being overweight in the
Vietnamese people were positively linked to socio-
economic status indices [12].  The prevalence of being
overweight or obese in Vietnam is lower as compared to
the findings in other Western countries [13]. However, the
prevalence of being overweight and obese has rapidly in-
creased in Vietnam with the economic development and
the changing lifestyle which has been influenced by West-
ern cultures.
Unfortunately, there are no further studies published in
English language journals on the prevalence of eating
disorders in Vietnam. From the few results showing the
prevalence of being overweight and obese, it could be as-
sumed that some symptoms of bulimia nervosa, anorexia
nervosa, disordered eating behaviors, or body dissatisfac-
tion might also appear in Vietnam currently. In particular,
disordered eating behaviors and eating disorders have often
been observed in association with economic development,
rising incomes, and economic prosperity with females be-
ing more susceptible than males [8,14]. It can be assumed
that eating disorder behaviors could be observed in young
Vietnamese female students who are easily exposed to 
these diverse influencing factors that are currently dis-
cussed in the research context.
Hence, the aim of this study was to look for disordered
eating behaviors in female university students in Vietnam.
Given the extreme changes in society and lifestyle as well
as the rapid economic development, one would expect to
find disordered eating behaviors in female university
students in Vietnam. In the current study the SCOFF
questionnaire [15] was used to screen for disordered
eating patterns, while the Eating Disorder Inventory 2 [16]
was used to examine disordered eating behaviors in more
detail.
Methods
Participants
A Vietnamese researcher visited a number of lectures
at the Hanoi Medical University and briefly introduced
the current study. The students voluntarily took ap-
proximately 15–20 minutes to complete the question-
naires after their lectures. A total of 244 female
students from the Hanoi Medical University in
Vietnam participated in the study. 41 incomplete ques-
tionnaires were excluded from data analysis. Therefore,
the response rate was 83.2% and a total of 203 female
student questionnaires (age range from 17 to 31) were
used for the statistical analysis.
Procedure
The questionnaires of the current study were translated
from English into Vietnamese by one bilingual psych-
iatrist, the translated questionnaires were then back-
translated by another bilingual psychiatrist. After
discussion with one further Vietnamese psychiatrist, the
translated questionnaires were finally modified for the
current study.
Measures
Body mass index
Self-reported height and weight were used to calculate the
Body Mass Index (BMI).  The BMI was calculated by
dividing body weight in kilograms by the square of height
in meters. The following classification was used: BMI ≥
30.00 indicates obesity, BMI ≥ 25.00 overweight, BMI =
18.50 – 24.99 defines the normal range, BMI lower than
18.50 is considered as underweight [17]. There is also a
recommendation how to classify the BMI in the Asian
population by the WHO [17]: A BMI ≥ 27.50 indicates a
higher risk for obesity, a BMI = 23.00 – 27.50 an increased
risk of being overweight, a BMI = 18.50 – 23.00 defines
the normal range, and a BMI of less than 18.50 is consid-
ered as underweight.

SCOFF questionnaire
The SCOFF questionnaire is an eating disorder screening
questionnaire developed by Morgan et al. [15],  which
contains 5 short questions regarding key aspects of eating
disorders such as vomiting, concerns about losing control
over how much one eats, weight loss, feeling fat and
whether food dominates life. The SCOFF questions read
as follows:
1. Do you make yourself SICK because you feel
uncomfortably full?
2. Do you worry that you have lost CONTROL over
how much you eat?
3. Have you recently lost more than ONE stone in a
3-month period?
4. Do you believe yourself to be FAT when others say
you are too thin?
5. Would you say that FOOD dominates your life?
These questions can be answered by ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Having
two or more ‘yes’ responses on the SCOFF questionnaire
indicates that the participant could have a high possibility
of having anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa [15]. Some
results from previous studies showed good reliability,
effectiveness and a convenient administration of the SCOFF
questionnaire [18,19].  Cronbach’s alpha of the SCOFF -
score was 0.28 in the current study.
Eating disorder inventory 2
The Eating Disorder Inventory 2 (EDI-2) is a self-report
measure with 91 items and 11 subscales developed by
Garner [16]. The subscales are: drive for thinness, bulimia,
body dissatisfaction, ineffectiveness, perfectionism, inter-
personal distrust, interoceptive awareness, maturity fears,
asceticism, impulse regulation, and social insecurity. Items
are rated on a scale from 1 (never) to 6 (always).  The
EDI-2 has good reliability and validity values and is one of
the most-used self-report measures for the assessment
and screening of eating disorders. To examine disordered 
eating behaviors, three subscales were used in the current
study. These consists of 23 items and include drive for
thinness (DT), bulimia (B) and body dissatisfaction (BD).
Cronbach’s alpha of the EDI-2 in the current study
was 0.85.
Data analysis
All variables defined in the study were analyzed by SPSS
version 15.0 in English. The means and the standard
deviations of age, Body Mass Index and other variables
were calculated, as well as the reliabilities and the correla-
tions between each item of the SCOFF. The three
subscales of the EDI-2 were also analyzed. Analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was performed to examine differences
between groups.
Results
Table 1 shows means, standard deviations and classification
of BMI and age. The mean age of the participants was
18.80 years (SD = 1.47), and the BMI was 19.04 (SD = 1.90).
The percentage of participants within the normal range of
the BMI was 53.2%.  The percentage of those who were
underweight was 45.3%, and 1.5% of the participants were
classified as overweight by the BMI classification of the
WHO. According to the BMI classification for Asian popu-
lations, the result showed: 0.5% as obese, 3.4% as over-
weight, 50.7% as within the normal range, and 45.3% as
underweight (see Table 1).
Table 2 shows the descriptive results for the EDI-2. The
mean score of the EDI-2 was 64.44 (SD = 17.09), the mean
of the subscale drive for thinness was 20.28 (SD = 8.48),
the mean of the subscale bulimia was 12.05 (SD = 4.14)
and the mean of the subscale body dissatisfaction was
32.11 (SD = 9.39).
Regarding the SCOFF questionnaire, 48.8% of the
participants reported two or more yes-responses (See
Table 3). 101 of the 203 participants answered ‘yes’ to the
SCOFF question ‘Do you worry that you have lost
CONTROL over how much you eat?,  while only 3 ’

participants answered ‘yes’  to the question ‘Have you re-
cently lost more than ONE stone in a 3-month period?’
(see Table 3).
The correlations among measures are presented in
Table 4. Data were inspected for normality and some data
were not normally distributed and thereby the Spearman
rank correlation statistic was used. The results showed
that there was a significant positive correlation between
the BMI and the EDI-2 (rho = 0.67, p < 0.0001).  The
SCOFF showed a negative statistically significant correl-
ation with the BMI (rho = −0.15, p < 0.0383). The correl-
ation between the SCOFF and the EDI-2 showed a
significant negative association (rho = −0.29, p < 0.0001).
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant
difference between the drive for thinness score and the
body dissatisfaction score of the EDI-2 in the 3 categories
of the BMI classification, F (2,200) = 55.624 (p < .001),
F (2,200) = 30.718 (p < .001),  respectively. Furthermore,
post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indi-
cated that the mean score of the drive for thinness scale
in the group being underweight (M = 14.79, SD = 6.81)
was significantly different compared to the normal
weight group (M = 24.65, SD = 6.86) and the group
with overweight (M = 31.33, SD = 6.66). Additionally, the
mean of underweight individuals (M = 27.24, SD = 7.57)
was significantly different compared to the mean of

Discussion
Prevalence of underweight and overweight
Results show that 45.3% of the participating female
university students in Vietnam were underweight. The
previous national surveys from 1992 and 2002 reported
that the percentage of underweight females between the
ages of 18 and 34 were 30.5% and 30.3%, respectively [10].
The research by Cuong et al. [13] showed that the preva-
lence of underweight females in Ho Chi Minh City was
20.4%, and the survey from Hanoi in 2004 showed 22.4%
underweight females between the ages of 25 and 34 [20].
The percentage of underweight females in the current
study is higher compared to findings of previous studies.
One possible explanation for this result may be related to
factors influencing the development of disordered eating
such as an increased exposure to Western culture, higher
education levels, and socio economic development in
Hanoi. Vietnamese students may focus more strongly on
the body ideal from Western countries; for example, they
might believe that body thinness is necessary to be suc-
cessful in modern society. Another possible explanation
could be that since 2008 the capital city Hanoi has grown
two to three times because of the addition of the Hatay
province. Therefore, the universities in Hanoi have more
students coming from areas outside of the city whose
family members are farmers with low incomes. The
families have to pay tuition fees as well as room and board
for their adult children when they go to the university in
Hanoi. However, often their incomes are not sufficient to
cover all the costs for the students living in Hanoi. This
could be one of the reasons why some students become
underweight since they can not afford a proper diet. This
might also explain the results found in the surveys.
Previous studies conducted in Vietnam revealing the
prevalence of underweight Vietnamese adults in urban
areas as well as a growing prevalence of overweight
individuals seem to indicate an important public health
problem [13]. Unfortunately, there is very limited research
addressing the prevalence and characteristics of an
underweight Vietnamese population. Additionally, the
BMI - criteria of the WHO are not specific enough to de-
fine what has to be considered as underweight in Asian
people. Many Asian people tend to have a smaller body
mass index compared to Western people and probably
need a different set of criteria for the measure of body
mass. The WHO has a recommendation for a BMI

classification in Asians [17], but that only accounts for
the differentiation between being overweight and obese.
A previous survey on participants in Ho Chi Minh City
showed an increase in the number of overweight females. It
found that 9.7% of females between the ages of 15 and 49
were overweight [21]. Additionally, the prevalence of over-
weight females between the ages of 20 and 29 in Ho Chi
Minh City was 11.3% [13]. Another national survey showed
that 2.5% of females between the ages of 18 and 34 were
overweight [10]. A survey from Hanoi in 2004 showed that
18.1% of females between the ages 25 and 34 were over-
weight [20]. However, the result of the current study found
only 1.5% as being overweight. Even if using the BMI- cri-
teria for Asians, the percentages of overweight and obese
females in the current study was 3.4% and 0.5%,
respectively.
Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City are the two largest cities in
Vietnam and have populations of 6,936,900 and 7,818,200,
respectively [22]. Cuong et al. [13] reported that being over-
weight is associated with higher economic status in Ho Chi

Minh City. This was especially true for males between the
ages of 40 and 49 [13]. The prevalence of overweight males
in Vietnam might be attributed to being rich and successful,
as weight increases with socio economic status and higher
income, but these factors appear to be less relevant for
women in Vietnam [13]. The fact that only young female
university students participated in the current study could
explain why the rate of being overweight was lower as
compared to findings from previous studies.
Disordered eating behaviors
48.8% of the participants reported two or more yes-
responses on the SCOFF. According to Morgan et al. [15]
this indicates that 48.8% of the Vietnamese participants
have a very high possibility of having eating disorder
symptoms. In the female group from a previous pilot
study in Vietnamese high school students a similar
percentage of 42.6% showed more than 2 yes-reponses
[23].  One particularly interesting result is that 49.8% of
the participants answered ‘yes’  to the SCOFF question
number 2 (Do you worry that you have lost control over
how much you eat?). This result is the same as the result
in the previous pilot study [23], where most of the female
high school students answered ‘yes’ to question number 2.
The SCOFF question number 3 (Have you recently lost
more than one stone in a 3-month period?) received the
fewest ‘yes’ answers in both studies. The pilot study [23]
and the current study only found a very low percentage of
obese participants. The rate of overweight participants
was 1.6% and 1.5%,  respectively. These similar results
from two Vietnam samples indicate it might be possible
that despite a low body mass index many young females
in Vietnam worry about losing control of their eating
behaviors. This indicates that there might be a potential

risk for young females in Vietnam of developing disor-
dered eating behaviors.
However, the relationship between the SCOFF score and
the EDI-2 scales showed a significant negative correlation.
Furthermore, there was a slightly negative correlation
between the SCOFF and the BMI. Regarding reliability,
according to Schmitt [24], a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.60 or
0.70 indicates an acceptable reliability, and 0.70 or higher
values indicate a good reliability. Cronbach’s alpha of the
SCOFF showed an insufficient reliability of 0.28 in the
current study. The SCOFF questionnaire has been validated
in the US and in the UK and in these countries showed
good validity and reliability as a screening instrument [18].
The SCOFF questionnaire has also been used as a screen-
ing test for children and adolescents in Germany, and it
showed good validity as well [19]. In addition, the SCOFF
in the French version showed good accuracy and reliability
for the detection of women with EDs in the high-risk
French student population [25].  In Asian cultures, the
SCOFF score showed a positive relationship with the global
score of the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire
and showed acceptable psychometric properties in Hong
Kong secondary school students [26]. However, it has been
suggested that translated versions need to be amended to
address cultural issues [27]. Crosby et al. [27] mentioned
that questions such as ‘do you make yourself sick’ may have
different meanings outside of the UK. Furthermore, the
Korean SCOFF questionnaires were inappropriate for im-
proving the screening of eating disorders due to low
internal consistency and reliability in the study by Jung
et al. [28]. In summary, the SCOFF has shown inconsistent
reliability in diverse cultural groups. The insufficient reli-
ability and the lack of a significant relationship between the
SCOFF and the EDI-2 in the current study also shows that
there is a need for further studies using the SCOFF ques-
tionnaire in different samples and adapt it according to
different cultural contexts.
Cronbach’s alpha of the EDI-2 indicated a good reli-
ability with 0.85 in the current study. The subscales
drive for thinness and body dissatisfaction of the EDI-2
showed a positive and significant relation to the BMI. In
particular, the underweight group showed significantly
lower scores on these two scales compared to normal
weight and overweight individuals. This means that
Vietnamese female students are dissatisfied with their
body and feel a drive to be thin when they consider
themselves to be overweight. There is no cut-off score
for the EDI-2, but higher scores can be assumed to be
related to a greater possibility of having disordered eat-
ing behaviors. Therefore, it is possible that the normal
and overweight groups of young female Vietnamese
have difficulty with drive for thinness or body dissatis-
faction. As mentioned before, the ideal of thinness as
seen through mass media products from Western 
cultures might be influencing this development in
young female students in Vietnam.
Some further limitations of the current study need to
be mentioned: The sample included only female students
in the capital city in Vietnam. In addition, the translated
questionnaires were self-report instruments and have
not been validated in Vietnam yet. Furthermore, there is
no information about dieting behavior or traditional
eating behavior in Vietnam that can help to better
understand the results.
Conclusions
Despite the limitations, the current study shows a tendency
in young female university students in urban Vietnam to
become underweight and to develop disordered eating
behaviors as well as a drive for thinness and body dissatis-
faction according to the EDI-2. Additionally, findings of the
SCOFF indicate that there is a risk group that shows signs
of eating disorder symptoms. However, in order to verify
this development more surveys and research are needed.
