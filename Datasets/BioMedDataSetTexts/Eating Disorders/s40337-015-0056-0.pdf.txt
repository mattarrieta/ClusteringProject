Prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of
DSM-5 eating disorders in the Australian population
Phillipa Hay1,2*, Federico Girosi1 and Jonathan Mond3
Abstract
Background: New DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for eating disorders were published in 2013. Adolescent cohort studies
in the Australian community indicate that the point prevalence of DSM-5 eating disorders may be as high as 15%
in females and 3% in males. The goal of the current study was to determine the 3-month prevalence of DSM-5
disorders in a representative sample of Australian older adolescents and adults. A secondary aim was to explore
the demographic correlates of these disorders, specifically, age, gender, income, and educational attainment and
presence of obesity.
Methods: We conducted and merged sequential cross-sectional population survey data of adults (aged over 15
years) collected in 2008 and in 2009 (n = 6041). Demographic information and the occurrence of regular (at least
weekly over the past 3 months) objective and subjective binge eating, extreme dietary restriction, purging behaviors,
and overvaluation of weight and/or shape, were assessed.
Results: The 3-month prevalence of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa were both under 1% whereas the
prevalence of binge eating disorder (BED) and sub-threshold BED were 5.6-6.9%. The prevalence of BED including
overvaluation of weight/shape was 3%. Other specified and unspecified eating disorders including purging
disorder were less common, under 1% to 1.4%. While people with eating disorders were generally younger than
others, the mean age was in the fourth decade for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa and in the fourth or fifth
decade for all other disorders. Most people with eating disorders had similar household incomes and educational
attainments to the general population. People with bulimia nervosa, BED and sub-threshold bulimia nervosa were
more likely to be obese than people without an eating disorder.
Conclusions: The findings support the expanded demographic distribution of eating disorders. There is a
relatively high prevalence of BED compared to anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. As it is in BED, obesity is a
very common co-morbidity in bulimia nervosa.

Background
Prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of DSM-5
eating disorders in the Australian population
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
criteria for eating disorders were revised in 2013 [1,2]. In
the DSM-IV [1] three eating disorders, anorexia nervosa,
bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder (BED- classified
under Eating Disorder not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS)),

had specific criteria. People who did not meet criteria but
nevertheless had an eating disorder were also classified
under EDNOS. EDNOS was, however, the most common
of all the syndromes in both the clinic and community [3].
A key aim of the revision was to broaden criteria for bu-
limia nervosa and anorexia nervosa and include BED as a
third, formal diagnosis. For bulimia nervosa and BED the
specific change was to reduce frequency of binge eating
(and for bulimia nervosa compensatory weight-control
behaviours) from twice to once weekly and for BED the
duration of symptoms was aligned with bulimia nervosa
to be 3-months rather than 6-months [4].  EDNOS has
also been revised into two new categories: Other Specified

Eating or Feeding Disorder (OSFED) and Unspecified
Feeding or Eating Disorder (UFED).  OSFED has two
groups characterized by recurrent binge eating, namely,
sub-threshold bulimia nervosa and sub-threshold BED
where binge eating frequency and/or the duration of com-
pensatory behaviours are less than weekly for three
months. A further overeating subtype of OSFED, night
eating syndrome, does not specify that the excessive food
consumption entails binge eating episodes.
The DSM-5 revisions have empirical support and are
likely to also be introduced in upcoming revisions of the
alternate international diagnostic scheme, namely, the
International Classification of Diseases [5]. The ICD re-
visions may however go further in removing the require-
ment that binge eating episodes entail consumption of
an unusually large amount of food, such that people
who experience a loss of control over eating but who
binge on normal sized food portions – i.e., people who
have subjective binge eating episodes – may be eligible
for the diagnoses of bulimia nervosa and BED. This is
supported by evidence that that the size of the binge is
of less clinical utility, diagnostic validity and concern to
people who binge than is the experience of being out of
control when eating (e.g. Latner and colleagues [6] and
Mond [7]).
Criteria for new disorders in DSM-5 depart from those
for anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa in not requir-
ing the overvaluation of weight/shape or other body
image disturbance. However, overvaluation of weight/
shape has been argued to have clinical utility as a diag-
nostic specifier, or perhaps, diagnostic criterion, of BED
[8,9].  New disorders such as BED also appear to have
different demographic correlates to anorexia nervosa
and possibly bulimia nervosa, occurring in older people
with a more even sex distribution [10].  There is also
potential for people to meet criteria for more than one
disorder depending on interpretation of the term “recur-
rent” in regards to purging episodes. For example, a per-
son who has weekly objective binge eating episodes, less
than weekly purging episodes, and overvaluation of
shape or weight, may be diagnosed as binge eating dis-
order (if the less-than-weekly purging is deemed “not-re-
current”) or bulimia nervosa of sub-threshold frequency
and/or duration, i.e. OSFED.
There have been a small number of epidemiologic
studies of DSM-5 anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa,
BED, and other disorders involving recurrent binge
eating. The community-based 2005 South Australian
Health Omnibus Survey (SAHOS) of people aged 15 or
more years [11] found a 3-month prevalence of around
1% for bulimia nervosa (84% females), 2% for BED (67%
females), 2% for other EDNOS cases (69% females) and
0.3% anorexia nervosa (80% female) using the DSM-5
criteria of weekly frequency of binge eating and extreme 
weight control behaviours and broader criteria for an-
orexia nervosa (DSM-5 criteria A and C). These findings
were in accord, generally, with international studies
which have reported general population point or 12-
month prevalence figures for DSM-IV bulimia nervosa
of around 2% in women and 0.5% in men and for BED
of around 3.5% in women and 2.0% in men [12-15]. Use
of different diagnostic schemes, population samples, and
assessment instruments likely account for variations in
prevalence [16].
Estimates of the lifetime prevalence of DSM-5 eating
disorders have since been derived in population-based
cohort samples of young female twins by Wade and col-
leagues [17]. These found a lifetime prevalence of 1-2%
for bulimia nervosa and an additional 2% of women met
criteria for BED. In a community cohort of 699 adolescent
female twins 5.4% of participants had DSM-anorexia
nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or BED, 5% OSFED and 4.7%
UFED [18,19].  Allen and colleagues [20] reported one-
month prevalence of DSM-5 eating disorders in 1383 chil-
dren of a cohort of 2804 Australian mothers. At age 20,
the point prevalence of DSM-5 eating disorders was 15.2%
in females (most bulimia nervosa or BED) and 2.9% in
males (mostly OSFED). A community-based study of 1584
adolescents in Holland [21] found that 5.7% of the female
(95% CI 4.2–7.5) and 1.2% of the male adolescents (95%
CI 0.6–2.3) met DSM-5 criteria for an eating disorder in
their lifetime, BED being the most common diagnosis
followed by anorexia nervosa. Much higher one-month
prevalence of OSFED/UFED (43%) and BED (9.9%) were
reported in a sample of college age students in the US
with rates for anorexia nervosa of 0.1% and bulimia ner-
vosa 1.2% [22]. Large international variation in prevalence
estimates support the need for further, population-based
research.
In addition to informing community prevalence, epi-
demiologic surveys can inform the socio-demographic
distribution of eating disorders free from the selection
bias inherent in clinic samples, for example, access and
availability of care [10].  Sex, age and socio-economic
status are particular demographic correlates whose rates
have been thought to vary across eating disorder diagnos-
tic groups [10] with aetiologic and health care provision
import. For example the sex bias towards women has been
thought to be relevant to greater social pressures on
women to be thin, exemplified in the book “Fat is a femin-
ist issue” [23]. Others have relevance to access to care. For
example, limited financial capacity to pay for health care
and in men embarrassment with having a perceived
“female” problem are important barriers to seeking help
[24,25] and the misperceptions that eating disorders are
uncommon in lower socio economic groups or men may
thereby contribute to deficits in health care provision to
these groups.

The goal of the current study was to determine the
3-month prevalence of DSM-5 disorders in a representa-
tive sample of Australian older adolescents and adults.
Secondary aims were to compare the prevalence of bulimia
nervosa and BED according to DSM-IV and DSM-5
criteria, and of BED with and without overvaluation as a
diagnostic criterion, and to delineate the demographic
correlates of eating disorder diagnoses, specifically, age,
gender, household income and education level distributions.
Methods
Study design and participant recruitment
Data in this study were collected from questions that
were embedded in two independent cross-sectional Health
Omnibus Surveys, conducted in 2008 and in 2009. The
Health Omnibus Survey is conducted annually by Harrison
Health Research [26],  under the auspices of the South
Australian Health Commission, and involves face-to-face
interviews of a representative sample of the South Australian
population. The interviews are respondent-based and ask
a range of both demographic and health-related questions.
The sample selection and interview procedures were
similar in both survey years. In both years, metropolitan
and rural “collector” districts in South Australia were
identified based on a probability proportional to size
sampling procedure, according to the Australian Bureau
of Statistics 2006 Census data. Within each district, 10
dwellings were chosen to conduct interviews in. The
person to be interviewed within each dwelling was the
person who was older than 15 years and had their birth-
day most recently. The samples were non-replacement,
and up to six visits were made to conduct an interview
with the designated participant in each designated dwell-
ing. Interviews were conducted from February until July
in 2008 and from September until December in 2009. In
total 6041 people (range 15–96 years) were interviewed.
To ensure feasibility and participant understanding of
questions over 50 interviews were conducted in a pilot
period during January 2008 and August 2009.
In 2008 and 5000 and in 2009 5200 households were
selected and 3034 and 3007 interviews were conducted
respectively. The response rates were 62.8% in 2008 and
59.3% in 2009 with the majority reason for non-
participation was refusal (n = 1110 in 2008 and 1376 in
2009).
Ethics statement
Participants provided verbal rather than written informed
consent, due to the practicalities of carrying out a large-
scale survey and the low risk nature of the survey content.
The 2008 survey was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of the Government of South Australia,
Department of Health, and the 2009 survey was
approved by the University of Adelaide HREC. 
Assessment of eating disorder features
Four eating disorder features were assessed, namely:
binge eating (objective and subjective); purging; extreme
dietary restriction; and the overvaluation of weight or
shape. The questions in the surveys that were to elicit
information regarding the presence of these features
from participants were based on diagnostic questions
from The Eating Disorder Examination [27].  Objective
binge eating was assessed in both surveys by asking
participants whether they regularly felt that they ate ‘an
unusually large amount of food’ and at the same time ex-
perienced a feeling of being ‘out of control’.  Subjective
binge eating was measured similarly to objective binge
eating except that the amount of food consumed was
defined as not unusually large. Purging was assessed in
both surveys by asking participants whether they regularly
used laxatives, diuretics (water tablets),  or self-induced
vomiting as a means to control their weight or shape. Ex-
treme dieting was assessed in both surveys by asking par-
ticipants whether they have regularly gone on a ‘very strict
diet’ or ‘hardly eaten anything at all’ in order to influence
their weight or shape. The term ‘regular’ used in each of
these questions was defined as the behavior having oc-
curred at least once per week over the three months prior
to the interview. Participants were asked the level of im-
portance they placed on weight and/or shape in determin-
ing their self-evaluation on a 6-point scale. Answers to
this question were grouped into two categories, namely,
overvaluation absent (participants who reported none to
moderate importance of weight and shape in determining
self-evaluation) and overvaluation present (participants
who reported extreme to supreme importance of weight
and shape in determining self-evaluation, at a level of 4, 5
or 6). Current body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was calcu-
lated based on self-reported weight and height.
For the purpose of creating mutually exclusive diag-
nostic categories, the following criteria were used to de-
fine the DSM-5 diagnostic terms: anorexia nervosa was
defined as participants with BMI < 18 and weight/shape
overvaluation at a level of 4, 5 or 6 (i.e. DSM-5 criteria
A and C);  bulimia nervosa was defined as participants
with weekly objectively large binge eating episodes and
purging episodes or strict dieting occurring weekly and
weight/shape overvaluation at a level of 4, 5 or 6 and
BMI 18 or more (i.e., all the DSM-5 criteria); BED was
defined as participants with weekly objectively large
being eating episodes, no weekly purging and BMI 18 or
more (i.e.,  DSM-5 criteria A, D, E);  OSFED bulimia
nervosa-type (bulimia nervosa of sub-threshold fre-
quency and/or duration) was defined as less than weekly
objective bulimic episodes, weekly purging or dieting
weekly and weight/shape overvaluation at a level of 4, 5
or 6; OSFED BED-type (BED of sub-threshold frequency
and/or duration) was defined as less than weekly objective
Page 4
Hay et al. Journal of Eating Disorders (2015) 3:19  Page 4 of 7
bulimic episodes, no weekly purging or dieting, and not
meeting criteria for AN; OSFED ‘purging disorder’  was
defined as having weekly purging episodes, no objectively
large binge eating episodes and not meeting criteria for
anorexia nervosa; and UFED was defined as having weekly
subjective and/or objective binge eating episodes, or
weekly purging episodes, or strict dieting with overvalu-
ation, or strict dieting with BMI <18, and not meeting cri-
teria for another diagnostic category.
Data analysis
Data from the two surveys, which comprised distinct
samples interviewed 12 months apart, were merged for
the purpose of the current study. Data in both years
were weighted by the inverse of the individual's probability
of selection, then re-weighted to benchmarks derived from
the Estimated Resident Populations at 30th June 1994, by
age, sex and Local Government Area, from the Australian
Bureau of Statistics (Catalogue No 3204.4). Weighted data
are reported in this paper. Prevalence data are reported
as percentages with 95% C.I. calculated using the
Newcombe-Wilson [28] method without continuity
correction using an Excel syntax. Statistical differences
between groups were tested using oneway ANOVA with
Tukey post-hoc for parametric data and Kruskal-Wallis
(K-W), Mann–Whitney U (M-W) and Chi-sqare (χ2) tests
as appropriate for ordinal or categorical data. All statistical
analysis was conducted using SPSS version 22.
Results
Identification of cases
The 3-month point prevalence of any form of a DSM-5
eating disorder or disordered eating was 16.3% (N = 985
95% CI 15.4 to 17.3). The prevalence of each disorder is
shown in Table 1. Together anorexia nervosa (n = 28), bu-
limia nervosa (n = 40) and BED (n = 337) accounted for
6.7% of community cases (95% CI 6.1 to 7.4). As can be
seen, the prevalence of bulimia nervosa and BED was
reduced by nearly 50% if the DSM-IV twice weekly fre-
quency of behaviours is applied and the prevalence of
BED and sub-threshold BED was reduced by a third if
overvaluation as a diagnostic specifier is applied.
Demographic analyses
The demographic correlates of the disorders are shown
in Table 2. There was an overall age difference between
groups (one-way ANOVA F = 26.32, df = 7, p < 0.001;
Tukey post-hoc p < 0.05). People with anorexia nervosa,
bulimia nervosa, BED, sub-threshold bulimia nervosa,
sub-threshold BED and UFED were significantly youn-
ger than people without an eating disorder. People with
purging disorder were significantly older than people
with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, sub-threshold
bulimia nervosa and sub-threshold BED.

There was an overall difference in sex distribution with
a significant female majority in all groups excepting
those with sub-threshold BED (Chi square χ2 = 64.3,
df = 7, p < .001).
Income was grouped into 9 levels from less than
$12000 to more than $100000 Australian dollars per
year. The median income level for the whole sample was
$6000-80000 per year (IQ range $30000-40000 to
$80000-100000). All participants with an eating disorder
had a higher median income compared to people without
an eating disorder (M-W U Z = −2.97, n = 4704, p = .003).
There was an overall difference in median income
levels between eating disorder groups and people without
an eating disorder (K-W test χ2 = 25.8, df = 7, p = .001).
Individuals with sub-threshold BED and UFED had higher
incomes than people without sub-threshold binge eating
or UFED respectively (M-W U Z = −3.76, p < .001, M-W
U Z = −2.55, p = .011) and this was whether overvaluation
was or was not a diagnostic specifier for sub-
threshold BED (M-W Z = −2.81, p = .005 and M-W
Z = −2.67, p = .008 respectively). No other eating dis-
order or disordered eating group differed significantly in
median incomes from people without an eating disorder
(i.e. all those without the respective eating disorder or dis-
ordered eating group).
Education was grouped into five levels of: currently
at school, left school with no qualification yet attained,
attained a certificate or trade level qualification, and
attained a bachelor’s degree or higher. The median
level of education in the whole sample was having left
school without a qualification. Level of education did
not differ across groups (K-W χ2 = 6.93, df = 7, n = 5338,
p = .44).

Data reported in this table are weighted for South Australian norms; BN = bulimia nervosa, BED = binge eating disorder, OSFED = Other Specified Eating or
Feeding Disorder, UFED = Unspecified Feeding or Eating Disorder.
There was an overall between group difference in distri-
bution of obesity (χ2 = 126.96, df = 7, p < .001, n = 6039)
with a lower proportion of obesity found in individuals
without an ED and in those with sub-threshold BED, pur-
ging disorder and UFED (p < .05). This contrasted with a
higher proportion of obesity in individuals with bulimia
nervosa, BED and sub-threshold bulimia nervosa.
Discussion
The present study found a 3-month point prevalence of
16.3% for any DSM-5 eating disorder and this was
largely due to the numbers of people with BED (6%) and
sub-threshold (or OSFED-type) BED (7%).  In contrast
anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa each occurred in
less than 1% of the general population. Rates for BED
were substantially lower (3%) if overvaluation was in-
cluded as a diagnostic criterion, as it was in the 2005
Australian survey [11]. The figures for BED with over-
valuation are commensurate with those found in the
2005 Australian survey and for DSM-IV BED in inter-
national studies [13]. The high prevalence of BED and
OSFED- type BED in the present study is consistent
with figures in adolescent and young adult cohort
samples [19-21].
As found by others [22] the DSM-5 criteria has
reduced numbers of people in the OSFED/UFED cat-
egories compared to the former EDNOS DSM-IV [1]
category. This can be explained by the broadening of
diagnostic criteria for all three main eating disorders, an-
orexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and BED. Decreasing
the frequency criteria for bulimia nervosa and BED be-
haviours in particular has resulted in notable increases
in the prevalence of these disorders. This should assist
health care planning and provision of specific evidence
based treatment services for these eating disorders and 
compares with the previous situation where it was difficult
to plan specific service needs of people with EDNOS due
to the lack of a specific evidence base for treatments of
this heterogenous category [29].
The study found that people with an eating disorder
are generally younger than people without an eating but
this was most apparent in those with anorexia nervosa
or bulimia nervosa, who had mean age in the fourth
decade. People with BED, OSFED or UFED had mean
ages in their mid-life years and people with purging dis-
order had a mean age similar to that of the general
population. Female predominance was most marked in
people with anorexia nervosa and was least pronounced
in people with disordered eating characterised by recur-
rent binge eating where rates approached sex equiva-
lence. Median incomes were higher for people with an
eating disorder compared to the general community but
on post-hoc analyses only in individuals with sub-threshold
BED and UFED. Educational attainment was similar for
people with eating disorders compared to that of the wider
community. Taken together these findings support the ex-
panded distribution of eating disorders in terms of demo-
graphic characteristics, including increasing numbers of
males in the community with these disorders, particularly
those characterised by recurrent binge eating [10,13].
We also found that obesity was a common feature of
individuals with eating disorders. People with bulimia
nervosa, BED and sub-threshold bulimia nervosa were
more likely to be obese than people who did not have
these disorders whilst those with UFED, purging dis-
order and sub-threshold BED had lower rate of obesity.
The last three groups were those also with lower levels
by definition of binge eating. Those with bulimia ner-
vosa and BED had by definition the highest levels of
binge eating. However, it is unclear why the proportion

of people with obesity was higher for those with sub-
threshold bulimia nervosa compared to sub-threshold
BED (21% versus 41%) as the former by definition in this
study (in order to create distinct categories) engaged in
regular weight control behaviours which might have
been thought to reduce levels of obesity. Alternatively,
individuals who are obese more frequently engage in
weight control behaviours [30]. The findings support recent
calls for a change in the assessment and care of bulimia
nervosa, as in BED, to encompass weight management as
well as eating disorder management [31].
Limitations of the present study relate primarily to the
assessment of eating disorder features which was by
structured interview by lay interviewers and not based
on clinical interviews. Weight control behaviours of less
than weekly frequency were not determined and there
was no assessment of excessive exercise among these be-
haviours. A further limitation of the assessment method
was that people with weight/shape overvaluation and
both less than weekly binge eating and less than weekly
weight control behaviours were not able to be identified
and included in the sub-threshold bulimia nervosa group
and this deficit may have inflated the rate of obesity in
people with subthreshold bulimia nervosa (as weight
control behaviours are more common in people who are
overweight or obese [30]).  In addition the use of a
respondent-based interview may have contributed to
over-reporting of frequency of binge eating and eating
disorders characterised by compulsive exercise, night
eating syndrome and ARFID were not assessed. Because
distress and the other diagnostic specifiers of binge eat-
ing in the DSM-5 criteria for BED and the criterion B
for DSM-5 anorexia nervosa were not assessed it is pos-
sible the prevalence of both BED and anorexia nervosa
was inflated. This is difficult to know because these
criteria are rarely used for research purposes. Further,
lower numbers in some groups, especially anorexia ner-
vosa, may have contributed to Type II error in secondary
analyses of between group differences. Finally, the study
is based in Australia and findings may differ in other
nations.
Conclusions
Eating disorders are common in the community
where there is a relatively high prevalence of BED
compared to anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.
The findings support the expanded demographic dis-
tribution of eating disorders and the need for services
to be inclusive of males as well as females and people
of all ages, incomes and education. As it is in BED,
obesity is a common co-morbidity in bulimia nervosa
and consideration needs to be given to addressing
weight disorder as well as the eating disorder in as-
sessment and treatment.
