Treatment for female patients with eating
disorders in the largest medical prison in Japan

Abstract
The number of offenders with eating disorders in women’s prisons in Japan has grown annually over the last
15 years. Women’s prisons have experienced significant difficulties in the management of patients with eating
disorders who have body-critical complications arising from low body weight, in addition to behavioral problems.
Patients in Japan’s 185 correctional facilities who display high refractoriness or who present a physical risk are
transferred to the Hachioji medical prison, a national specialty hospital operated by the Ministry of Justice. The
medical prison must manage any psychosomatic problems necessary for the safety of inmates regardless of a
patient’s wishes. The most common conviction resulting in imprisonment of women with eating disorders was
shoplifting (n = 44; 63%), with the second most common being drug-offenses (n = 17; 24%). While shoplifting is of
concern in relation to eating disorders, a causal relationship remains unclear. Most patients in the shoplifting group
did not have histories of antisocial and/or impulsive behaviors such as drug abuse, sexual deviation, self-injury, or
other criminal activity. Instead, shoplifting appears to be an obsessive-compulsive behavior deeply rooted in the
psychopathology of severe eating disorder patients. Patients in this group tended to have histories of relatively high
education and steady employment, although most also had histories of prolonged eating disorders and unstable
treatment. Although adherence to treatment was poor among patients with eating disorders in the medical prison,
body weight and behavioral problems improved following treatment in the special compulsory environment,
without severe sequelae or patient death. The Ministry of Justice recently established another specialized ward for
the care for female patients with eating disorders. If greater emphasis is placed on early-stage, protective, medical
treatment, the number of patients with eating disorders in prisons may decrease. Further research is required to
investigate the relationship between shoplifting and eating disorders.

Introduction
The association between shoplifting and eating disorders
has been a topic of discussion since the 1980s [1-6].
Shoplifting has been considered an impulsive behavior
that accompanies eating disorders, similar to substance
abuse, suicide attempts, self-injurious behavior, and sex-
ual deviance [7-12],  particularly in relation to multi-
impulsive bulimia nervosa [13-17].  However, there is a
paucity of research that focuses solely on patients with
eating disorders who repeatedly shoplift or are actually
incarcerated [18-22].  As shoplifting by patients with

eating disorders has been identified as a significant
problem in Japan [22-24], the present study reviewed the
circumstances of incarcerated Japanese patients with eat-
ing disorders incarcerated.
According to a survey by the Japanese Association of
Correctional Medicine, 116 (2.7%) of 4,240 prison in-
mates throughout the Japanese women’s prison system
were diagnosed with eating disorders as of October 1,
2011 [25].  The prison sentences for these patients re-
sulted from a variety of crimes; the most frequent of
which was repeated shoplifting (72%).  Drug-related of-
fences were the second most common (14%), while other
crimes, such as arson, murder, fraud, causing injury, and
traffic violations accounted for the remaining 14% [25].

correctional facilities in Japan is growing each year.
While these numbers may only represent a small sample
of the prison population, women’s prisons have experi-
enced significant difficulties in the management of
patients with eating disorders who have body-critical
complications arising from low body weight in addition
to behavioral problems [23,26].  A female inmate diag-
nosed with an eating disorder is sent to a general prison
from a detention center if she is not thought to be in an
emergency state, and those with severe eating disorders
are usually placed in a sickroom and not expected to
undertake prison labor [26].  Each general prison is
assigned doctors and nurses and is supplied with a var-
iety of nutritional supplements [25] (Figure 1).  Prisons
in Japan experience problems such as hunger strikes by
inmates, and female prisoners are reported to be suscep-
tible to eating behavior disorders because of their feel-
ings of anger and the constraints of the prison
environment [27].  Because many patients with eating
disorders continue to lose weight through vomiting and/ 
or anorexia, they fall into a psychosomatic body crisis
[25,26], These inmates must be observed vigilantly. If a
patient needs treatment for their severe psychosomatic
state in a hospital outside prison, two prison officers will
be required to stay with the patient, and the medical
cost becomes enormous. Thus, many patients with eat-
ing disorders in an extremely severe physical condition
are transferred to Hachioji Medical Prison, which is the
largest national specialty hospital operated by Japan’s
Ministry of Justice [26]. Inevitably, patients with eating
disorders transferred to Hachioji Medical Prison are lim-
ited to those with anorexia nervosa accompanied by
body crisis [25,26,28].  Because inmates cannot overeat
within the disciplined life of correctional facilities, the
health of patients with bulimia nervosa or binge-eating
disorder usually does not become severe [26]. Thus, the
group of patients with eating disorders that are pre-
sented in the current study is not a representative sam-
ple of the entire cohort of patients with eating disorders
in all of the general prisons in Japan.

This review is presented as a case report describing a
specific characteristic in a specific cohort of patients
with eating disorders who had been incarcerated in
Hachioji Medical Prison for shoplifting. Although this
study has many overlaps with the content of our previ-
ous study in BMC Psychiatry [29],  the purpose is to
describe more features by citing other findings from the
relevant literature.
Additionally, while occasionally there are some male
patients with eating disorders in men’s general and med-
ical prisons, very few male patients had eating disorders
at the time of incarceration and most of their symptoms
were observed as being transient or willful behavioral
problems that occurred in response to the special envir-
onment [26]. Therefore, in the current study, we do not
describe male patients with eating disorders.
Characteristics of patients with eating disorders in
Hachioji Medical Prison
In the three years from 1998, Hachioji Medical Prison
treated only four patients with eating disorders. Since
then, the number of patients with eating disorders has
increased rapidly [25,26,28], and the treatment duration
for these patients has been prolonged significantly com-
pared with the previous patients [26,28]. Medical prisons
are mandated to manage the personal psychosomatic
safety of all inmates, regardless of the wishes for treatment
by the individual patient [26]. Refusal to accept treatment
and relatively high dropout rates pose a major problem
for research on the treatment of anorexia nervosa in gen-
eral hospitals [30]. However, even if a patient refuses treat-
ment in a penal institution, discontinuation of treatment
is not an option in a medical prison, because prison ad-
ministrators have the responsibility of protecting patients
from psychosomatic risks [23,26,28,29].
Among the 131 female patients transferred between
2002 and 2011, 70 had an eating disorder; the largest
number was in Hachioji medical prison [29]. Among the
67 patients aged under 62 years in this group, the most
common convictions resulting in imprisonment were sho-
plifting (n = 44, 63%) and drug offences (n = 17, 24%) [29].
Here, we first describe the characteristics of patients
with eating disorders who were incarcerated for shoplift-
ing and then address patients with eating disorders who
had drug problems.
Patients with eating disorders who were incarcerated for
shoplifting (the Shoplifting group)
In most cases, patients in the shoplifting group tend not
to have antisocial behaviors and show low frequencies of
substance abuse and dangerous behaviors [29].  The
Shoplifting group tends to have a significantly higher
education history (9–16 years; mean age 13.1 years) than
does patients with drug offences (the Drug group) (9–12 
years; mean age 9.6 years) [29].  Our earlier study re-
ported that five patients in the Shoplifting group (n = 32)
graduated from university and that 11 graduated from
professional school [26]. However, the Shoplifting group
tends to have prolonged eating disorder histories and
maintains a low body weight [23,26]. There were signifi-
cantly more patients with comorbid obsessive-compulsive
disorder in the Shoplifting group (13, 32%) than in the
Drug group (0%) [29].
It is often thought that the shoplifting of food by
patients with eating disorders arises from a relative
shortage of food because food is consumed on a daily
basis [25,26]. However, patients in the Shoplifting group
included many with restricting type anorexia nervosa
(29%) [29]; these patients often had built up a large hoard
of food at home [25,26].  Patients with eating disorders
who were repeat shoplifters were reported to have signifi-
cantly higher levels of psychiatric disturbance, depressive
illness, and hoarding behavior [31].
Patients with eating disorders most commonly targeted
food when shoplifting. Most patients were not impover-
ished (10%) and had sufficient money to buy food at the
time of shoplifting, but responded that they had strong
hesitation to spending their money [26]. They had a clear
purpose for those foods they stole, that is, they usually
wanted to use them for eating or hoarding. We routinely
record in the prison record whether or not the patients
with eating disorders who were incarcerated for shoplift-
ing meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders IV-TR diagnosis criteria for kleptomania [26].
Only one patient in Hachioji Medical Prison had a diagno-
sis of kleptomania [26,29].
Generally, no history of systematic disturbance of con-
sciousness was present at the time of the shoplifting,
and they usually apologized promptly at each time of ar-
rest. [23,26]. As for patients in Hachioji Medical Prison,
most with eating disorders who were incarcerated for
shoplifting only were usually lacking in awareness of the
crisis of their disease and incarceration [23,26].  Only
25% of patients in the Shoplifting or Drug groups had
been undergoing treatment before their latest arrest
[26]. Even after opportunities for exemption from pros-
ecution, the patients in Hachioji Medical Prison had not
received treatment or stopped treatment halfway without
improvement [26].  It is difficult for patients to consult
an expert doctor accustomed to working the with the
offenses of patients with eating disorders without a law-
yer’s recommendation prior to the patient’s court ap-
pearance [26,28]. Many patients with eating disorders in
the medical prison ward had been unable to cease sho-
plifting and were sentenced to prison after two or more
suspended sentences [23,26].These patients reported
that they did not actually think that they could be incar-
cerated for their offense, even in a detention center [26].

Asami et al. BioPsychoSocial Medicine (2015) 9:13  Page 4 of 7
Most also continued their binge-purging behavior with
food from family and/or prison caterers before their
actual imprisonment [23].  However, after a conviction
was established, the patients tended to show difficulty
eating and lost weight rapidly [26]. It is possible that this
was influenced by the strict administrative environment
of prison, a sense of hopelessness, and a reduction in the
amount of available food.
Patients with eating disorders who were incarcerated for
drug-offenses (the Drug group)
Past papers that reported on the impulsivity of patients
with eating disorders found that patients with eating disor-
ders who were incarcerated for drug offences (the Drug
group) had various histories of substance abuse, impulsive
behavioral problems, and child abuse [29]. Previous pros-
ecution and/or incarceration for crimes other than shoplift-
ing was also evident in many patients in the Drug group;
many had experience working as prostitutes or night club
hostesses (57%), few had experience of full-time work, and
many also showed antisocial behaviors (79%) [29].
There is little overlap in the pattern of behavioral
problems between the two groups (Figure 2).
Treatment in Hachioji Medical Prison
Management of physical crisis
In this facility, many patients with eating disorders initially
refuse to engage in treatment, and even within the well-
disciplined prison environment with education about
the risk to their bodies, weight-loss actions persist
[26,28].  Patients tend to show clinical abnormalities,
such as disturbance of consciousness, hypothermia, and
electrolyte abnormality. Some also enter a state of shock
from pneumonia and pyelonephritis [25].
A psychiatrist provides consistent patient support from
the time of their physical crisis through to treatment 
acceptance in Hachioji Medical Prison [26]. Support from
internal medicine doctors, surgeons, and other doctors
can be obtained at any time, particularly because the in-
crease in calories during therapeutic feeding must be care-
fully considered [26,28]. However, to prevent irreversible
brain damage, the staff will order compulsory treatment,
such as a central venous nutrition catheter, which requires
body restraints because some patients repeatedly pull out
intranasal nutrition tubes and others intentionally vomit
their liquid nutrition [25,26,28].
Behavioral treatment based custody and other
supportive therapy
After a patient in the Shoplifting group recovers from a
body crisis, treatment progresses with behavioral ther-
apy, which may be combined with cognitive behavioral
and group therapies [26,28]. Any therapy-based restric-
tions on patients in the ward are lifted when their symp-
toms and weight improve [26]. It is a violation of prison
policy for a patient to have food in their room after
mealtime. However, some patients conceal food or vom-
itus in drawers, beds, washbasins or other hiding places
[25,26]. Because the rooms of individual patients in the
medical prison are locked and prison officers patrol every
15 minutes, 24 hours a day, behavioral problems are more
likely to be detected than in general hospital wards
[25,26].  Furthermore, a number of measures have been
put in place to allow more accurate observation during
treatment, such as inspection of belongings (toilet seats,
garbage boxes, bedding, and clothes), restriction of faucets
and drain outlets (water usage not allowed without obser-
vation by staff), and food given in a separate room with
2-hour postprandial monitoring [25,26].
When the patients are anxious and fearful in the
beginning of treatment, we sometimes prescribe anti-
psychotic drugs such as olanzapine. Since the patients

from references [25,26,29]).

with eating disorder in our ward have strong anxiety
in the process of weight gain, we often administer
antidepressants that have an anxiolytic effect, such as
paroxetine [25,26].
Psychiatrists conduct group therapy with a focus on
patients in the Shoplifting group. Because there are al-
ways approximately five patients in the Shoplifting group
in Hachioji Medical Prison, it is possible to have a
weekly group therapy. This therapy is thought to be ef-
fective in helping facilitate treatment [25,26].  Patients
who initially reject therapy and insist on denying their
own illness during group therapy begin to recognize the
danger they face and the purpose of therapy in casual
conversations with fellow patients who have been in the
medical prison longer [25,26].  After a patient attends
several months of the group therapy, they can often be
seen earnestly admonishing other patients with negative
attitudes. Our previous study found that all patients sat
in on sessions to observe the group therapy, and all pa-
tients, including those expected to object to or be fearful
of group therapy, expressed their desire to participate in
the next group session [26].
Behavioral problems during the clinical course
While food refusal and purging behaviors are common
in both the Shoplifting and Drug groups during hospital
care and treatment, falsifying dietary intake amounts,
food hoarding, and excessive exercise are observed more
frequently in the Shoplifting group [29].  Rumination is
observed in a large number of the Shoplifting group
[26], and excessive cleaning, fear of being unclean, and
compulsive writing are also prominent behaviors in this
group [25,26,28].  It is possible that these behaviors
express the obsessive and compulsive characteristics of
patients in the Shoplifting group. It is noteworthy that a
significantly higher number of patients in the Shoplifting
group exercise more excessively (19/42, 46%) than those
in the Drug group; they continue to exercise relentlessly
and this habit is difficult to suppress [29]. It is possible
that their shoplifting occurrs incidentally during a state
of confusion, such as from hypoglycemia. Most patients
in the Shoplifting group had fallen into a confused state
at the time of admission (79%), and they tended to con-
tinue their problem behavior [25,26]. However, because
their excessive exercise behavior remained even after
body-weight recovery, it can be assumed that behaviors
such as the recurrence of compulsive shoplifting do
not occur solely because of the transient or acute decline
of body weight [23,28,29].  Frequent laxative requests
are observed in both eating disorder groups [26],  al-
though patients in the Shoplifting group tend not to
request drugs such as sleeping medications or tranquil-
izers [26,29].  Many patients in the Shoplifting group
(78%) strongly protest against clinical advice from the 
medical staff during the course of treatment [26], but do
not resort to disruptive, violent, or dangerous behaviors
such as ranting, making noise, or self-injury [29].  In
addition, many patients in the Shoplifting group eventu-
ally understand that treatment is necessary to prevent
reoffending [25,26].
Clinical outcome
Although BMI at the time of admission was 11.2 kg/m2
in the Shoplifting group and 12.1 kg/m2 in the Drug
group, the BMI of both at the end of the treatment im-
proved significantly (P < 0.001: 16.4 kg/m2,  16.5 kg/m2;
Shoplifting group, Drug group; respectively) [26]. We do
not think this is because we have an especially good
treatment method; rather, we think the specific circum-
stances of treatment in the medical prison that mean it
cannot be finished before gaining stable improvement
was the major contributor to their recovery. The treat-
ment duration for patients in the Shoplifting group
(mean 183 days) was significantly longer than for those
in the Drug group (mean 127 days); this may be related
to the depth of psychopathology in eating disorders [26].
Although adherence to eating disorder treatment was
poor among patients in the Shoplifting group, low body
weight and behavioral problems did improve following
treatment, without severe sequelae or patient death
[26,28]. Some patients complained about the eating dis-
order treatment in Hachioji Medical Prison, and one
patient said she would litigate [25,26]. No previous ob-
jection to treatment had been made by families or law-
yers, as generally the families of patients in Hachioji
Medical Prison are cooperative and are appreciative of
treatment [25,26].
Patients with eating disorders are returned to general
prisons when they maintain their BMI above 16.0 for
4 weeks and when they no longer exhibit behavioral
problems related to their eating disorder other than ex-
cessive exercise [26]. Patients are usually transferred to a
general prison that is located close to their place of resi-
dence, with potential opportunity for parole [26].
Treatment limitations and future focus
Accommodation of patients in medical prisons has
space limitations, and those patients with a physical cri-
sis are prioritized [26,29]. Therefore, the majority of pa-
tients in the present study were patients in an anorexic
state [25,28,29].
While ideally incarceration of patients with severe dis-
ease should be avoided, it may benefit patients who have
a severe, prolonged eating disorder and who have either
not had treatment or dropped out of treatment, because
the patients can experience a return to health owing to a
stable treatment process. The unique custodial environ-
ment in Hachioji Medical Prison enables the treatment
Page 6
Asami et al. BioPsychoSocial Medicine (2015) 9:13  Page 6 of 7
team to treat patients with severe eating disorders that
otherwise may not have received help. Outside of an en-
vironment like this, eating disorder practitioners are
often too busy to take new patients, and the medical set-
ting is often far from the patient’s home.
Following their release from prison, strong support for
the patient and regular outpatient treatment is desirable;
however, there is potential for a human rights issue to
emerge if this is forced upon patients [25,26]. Some eat-
ing disorder experts have defended patients prosecuted
for shoplifting in court, asserting that treatment should
take priority over punishment [23,28].  However, if
the patient is re-arrested, probation is revoked and the
offender’s imprisonment will become longer [26].  The
most important thing is not only to help the patient es-
cape from the impending incarceration, but also to con-
sider the patient’s personal and social circumstances
from a long-term perspective.
As general prisons develop experience in the manage-
ment of eating disorders, their ability to respond to
patients improves [28,31].  The Japanese Ministry of
Justice has now established a ward providing specialized
care for female patients with eating disorders in the
Kita-Kyushu medical prison, with some patients already
receiving expert treatment [31]. The Correction Bureau
within the Ministry of Justice is also considering future
measures, with guidance from the Japan Society of
Eating Disorders [31].
Study of the neurocircuits involved in planning and
interpreting consequences suggest that individuals who
have recovered from anorexia nervosa may have diffi-
culty in differentiating positive and negative feedback
[32]. It has also been reported that shoplifting is caused
by periods of worsened self-esteem, depression, or pur-
ging, and that no significant difference exists in long-
term criminal tendencies of patients with eating disor-
ders and other patients [33]. Shoplifting by patients with
eating disorders is often considered in relation to severe
psychopathology [10,18-21].
Conclusion
It can be said that patients with anorexia nervosa incar-
cerated for shoplifting are a peculiar group who do not
display antisocial characteristics or impulsivity. The psy-
chopathology of their severe eating disorders is probably
related to obsessive-compulsive behaviors. It can be as-
sumed that repeated shoplifting behavior may be done
by a patient who does not have other criminal or anti-
social behaviors if the patient’s eating disorder has been
severe and prolonged without treatment. If the main-
stream medical system were to place greater emphasis
on early-stage protective medical treatment, the number
of patients in the care of the justice system including
prison would probably decrease. It is difficult for the 
Japanese judicial authority to manage repeated shoplift-
ing by patients with eating disorders; we think there is
the possibility that similar difficulties arise within various
