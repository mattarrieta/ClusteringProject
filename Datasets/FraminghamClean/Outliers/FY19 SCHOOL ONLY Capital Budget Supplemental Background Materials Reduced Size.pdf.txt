1. Technology Upgrades District-Wide
FY19: 
The Office of Technology is requesting funds to continue to move forward with the District
Technology Plan. The goal of the plan is to provide a strong and dependable infrastructure 
as well as appropriate devices to support an advanced learning environment for the 21st century
student and educator. The Office’s intent is to lead and collaborate with students, staff and
district administration to meet both instructional and administrative goals of teaching and
learning district-wide. These funds are also being requested to refresh aged staff laptops
over 4 years old, and upgrade to a high-performance network using current technology.

2. District Pre-Feasibility Study - Hemenway
FY19: 
The District is considering replacement of the Hemenway Elementary School building as part of
the ongoing capital asset planning and required maintenance of the overall building infrastructure. 
We believe Hemenway to be of the most need for replacement. A pre-feasibility study is required
to evaluate the existing building, examine the demographic needs of the district and to determine
whether a new school building or renovation to an existing building is warranted. It may also be
determined that an alternative site is best, as a new building may be constructed without
interruption to the existing building and operations. This estimate is based on costs for
Fuller/Farley pre-feasibility study. 
$ 75,000

3. Furnish New and Replace Outdated Furniture – Phased Project
FY19: 
In order to address District population growth at the elementary level, the King School was
reopened as an elementary school in 2014. Since then, new furniture is purchased each year in
order to accommodate population growth. Kindergarten students were placed at the King School
in 2014 with an additional grade level added each year until the school reaches capacity as a K-5
school over a 6 year period.

6. Bucket Truck – B & G Department
FY19: 
Currently, the Buildings and Grounds Department owns one “Sky Jack” boom lift. This piece of
equipment is now 18 years old. 
We utilize the piece of equipment to gain access to school buildings and parking lot lights up to
28’ in height. Instead of replacing this lift in kind, we propose the purchase of a bucket truck in
order to eliminate the need of the boom lift. This would save time, money and improve safety
concerns in many ways (i.e. transporting, loading/unloading, and replacement of antiquated
equipment).

2. Masonry Repair and Repointing – Stapleton Elementary School
FY19: 
The Stapleton Elementary School is in need of exterior envelope upgrades as well as masonry
repointing and steel lintel replacement as needed above doors and windows to prevent damage
caused by moisture infiltration and to support capital investments previously made to this
historical building. 
The original building was constructed in 1922. The mortar joints between the brick masonry
exterior façade has deteriorated. The exterior brick, mortar, flashing and sealants need to be
upgraded as required in order to keep the building weather tight.

scope, review the project schedule, receive any Owner provided pertinent project related
documents (previous studies, architectural/structural drawings and specifications, and
as-built drawings from previous projects, leak history, etc.) and to determine the
procedure for accessing the referenced exterior building components.
2.  Perform detailed on-site investigation work as follows:
•  Visual examination with binoculars of the existing façade conditions will be
conducted from the ground and roof levels.
•  Visual examination of any reported leakage conditions at the building interior
areas (where accessible).

The Basic Services Fees are based upon the scope of services and the proposed project
milestone schedule, and includes the cost of all salaries, insurances, travel costs, photograph
costs, and design submissions (preliminary design & final design) reproduction costs. 
The Basic Services Fees includes producing and providing one (1) original set and an electronic
copy of P.E. stamped 100% final design construction bid documents to the Owner. Designer
will coordinate the reproduction and delivery of the bid documents to the Owner. Owner can
choose to pay for any bid document reproduction costs directly or pay Designer as a
reimbursable cost (cost plus 10%).  Owner is responsible for distribution of the bid documents
to prospective bidders. 
The Basic Services Fees does not include the following costs: access lift, contractor test cuts, 
and hazardous material designer services (material sampling & testing, specification
development, and air quality control monitoring).  Owner can choose to pay for this service
directly or pay Designer as a reimbursable cost (cost plus 10%).
The Basic Services Fees do not include any Designer costs specific to the following: (1) code
related deficiencies and/or code compliance issues; (2) structural engineering analysis and/or
calculations; and (3) mold infiltration. If additional Design Services pertaining to these items are
required, Designer will provide such as authorized by the Owner, for mutually agreed upon
additional compensation. 
The Basic Services Fees are based upon the assumption that Designer will only provide the
design services commensurate with and as required to document the scope of work that can be
completed within the Owner established construction budget of $775,000. If the Owner
increases the established construction budget, an additional fee may be required, as additional
designer services may be necessary. A separate proposal (change order) will be prepared in
advance of any additional work that would require additional fees. 
The Basic Services Fees includes producing and providing the information relative to
newspaper advertising for the bidding phase; the Owner is responsible for coordinating the
placement of such advertisement and the associated costs. 
The Basic Services Fees includes the following meetings and construction site visits: A. One (1) 
meeting to review the investigation/preliminary design submission; B. One (1) meeting to review
the construction documents submission; C. One (1) prebid meeting; D. One (1) bid opening
meeting; E. One (1) preconstruction meeting; and F. Six (6) periodic site visits during
construction. If additional meetings and/or site visits during construction are required, Designer
will provide such as requested by the Owner for mutually agreed upon additional compensation. 
Owner shall provide adequate access to the site, building exterior and interior areas. Designer
will not perform nor subcontract demolition or repair work under this Agreement, and Designer
shall not be responsible for any damage to building or contents resulting from the Work. 
It is understood that all pertinent project related information that the Owner has available will be
made available to Designer by the Owner. 
Any estimates of construction cost prepared by Designer are intended as an aid in budgeting. 
They are not quotations, or proposals to do the work for that price, and their accuracy is not
guaranteed. 
Invoices are processed on a percent completed basis and are issued monthly. Invoices are
due and payable within thirty days.

3. Bathroom Renovations – Barbieri Elementary School
FY19: 
The existing bathrooms at the Barbieri Elementary School do not comply with A.D.A. code
requirements. The existing facility was built in 1972 as a Middle School. The height of the
bathroom fixtures does not comply with the elementary school requirements. The proposed
renovation addresses the boys and girls gang toilet rooms on the first and second floor for a total
of 4 restrooms, (2 boys & 2 girls). There are additional bathrooms that will require A.D.A. 
updates in the future.
