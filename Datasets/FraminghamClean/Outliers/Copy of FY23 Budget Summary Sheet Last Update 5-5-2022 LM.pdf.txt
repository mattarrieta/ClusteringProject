12.2% Operating -Primary increase driven by self-check
out system lease for main and branch library. The
Library's integrated self-check out system is an
essential Library service which facilitates sharing
and document delivery between Minuteman
Network Libraries, maintains and controls library
inventory, and facilitates efficient, and safe patron
borrowing and returning of materials. The Library
has contracted with Bibliotheca, the industry
leader, for almost a decade for self check out
systems, hardware, and software. Our current
equipment, now almost 10 years old, is failing, 
needs replacement, and is no longer under
contract. After a cost analysis of purchasing
equipment outright, along with a service contract
vs. a subscription model now offered by
Bibliotheca, which includes service, licensing, and
equipment, we found there would be a savings of
$2,288.00 over 3 year term. Further, we received a
$50,000 grant in support of this contract, thereby
saving the City $87,312.00. The amount for one
year of equipment leasing for both libraries, plus
service, licensing and support is $43,656.

maintenance repairs. Certain repairs, however, 
need to be contracted out because they require
licensed technicians or tradesmen such as: boiler
repairs, electricians, plumbers, ammonia, 
dehumidifiers, fire, elevator, alarm service, etc. 
Annual expenditures from this line item include: 
twice a week deep cleaning services from October
through March for $23,000, an inspection of 15
fire extinguishers for approximately $600, 
cleaning and maintenance of 6 infrared heating
units (we also use this for regulating the
temperature in the building during the coldest
days) for $6,500, elevator inspection &
maintenance fees for approximately $4,600, fire
alarm & sprinkler service (Mammoth Fire Alarm
Company) & maintenance annual contract for
$3,000, BDA annual inspection (communication
for emergency calls from the arena to the fire
department) for $1,000, exterminator services for
$830, fire & elevator alarm monitoring at $360, 
and boiler inspection with the Commonwealth for
$150.
In addition to the above, we are budgeting for a
blanket purchase order in the amount of
$9,910.00 for North East Distributors that services
our Ammonia system. This year we spent a larger
-55.6% portion of our budget on maintenance for the Small Capital - For FY23 the Arena requesting is

4.7% Small Capital - FY23 equipment funding is
primarily supporting upgrades to the Nevins Hall
sound system. The current wireless microphone
frequencies are no longer supported. This project
includes a new Shure Microflex wireless audio
system similar to the product successfully
implemented in the council chambers. These
products will allow the department to dedicate
signal frequencies within the city hall without
interfering with other meeting spaces. This project
will also expand source capacity to host large
groups for public hearings. Currently, Nevins hall
only has six microphone sources. This limitation
creates challenges when hosting city boards, 
officials, and public participation simultaneously, 
which is frequently necessary during municipal
meetings. Additional related audio signal routing
will provide a dedicated feed for cable
broadcasting and tie lines for sending sources
directly from Media services. Another use of this
funding is for scheduled replacement of field and
studio equipment to ensure the reliability of our
production capabilities and minimize system and
equipment failure.

operating budgets for the next fiscal year. 
Depending on existing conditions at our inventory
of facilities in the spring of the budgeted fiscal
year (approximately 16 months from now) we
may be required to reallocate funds to alternate
locations and/or transfer in additional funds due
to the expansion and contraction of surface cracks

of an ongoing maintenance program with a few
areas being done every year. Sealcoating lasts
about 5 to 6 years depending on usage and
surface reaction to New England weather. After
each winter we reassess the damages and areas
that need attention. At some point the court

$14,164 Quote is from Richey & Clapper This piece
of equipment would replace our older 2005 model
that has had limited use over the past couple of
years because it keeps breaking down. Presently, 
one of the cylinders needs to be replaced. In
addition, the engine for this older model has been
discontinued making it very difficult to find
replacement parts. This is an important piece of
equipment for our Fall/Spring leaf clean-ups. We
also use this piece of equipment at the Edgell
Grove Cemetery to help with their leaf clean ups. 
The multitude of both Park and School properties
that we maintain requires the need for a reliable
Leaf Sucker.

0.0% Small Capital - The Police Department has 21
marked cruisers which are used for patrol
functions. These cruisers are subjected to much
more intensive wear and tear as compared to
regular vehicles. They contain power-intensive
equipment and may operate for extended periods
of time, both idling and operating with high
demands on the engines, brakes, electrical
systems, and powertrains. These vehicles operate
on a 24/7 basis. 
Our goal is to implement a 3 year rotation, 
whereby marked patrol cruisers are recycled for
less critical and demanding use within the
Department after 3 years, so as to extend their
lifecycles. This is cost-effective because the major
components are prone to failure after 3 years of
front-line patrol use. From a financial standpoint, 
it makes sense to recycle these vehicles rather
than to risk having to perform major repairs, 
which is expensive and which takes the vehicle
out of service.
Department plans to move to more Hybrid
vehicles in fleet. Hybrid vehicles are 4-5K more
expensive for the same model.
