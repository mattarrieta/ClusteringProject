New or Transferred Alcohol License Application Process
Before submitting any applications, contact the Licensing Office at 508-532-5402 or
 drw@framinghamma.gov to inquire if there is an available license.
There is a Framingham portion and a State Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission (ABCC) portion to
the alcohol license application process. All applications and required documents must be submitted to
the Licensing Office with the Framingham Fees. The ABCC fee is $200 payable online. Framingham
requires an Assistant Manager of Record. If that person or the Manager is ever replaced, you'll need to
apply to amend the alcohol license. Below are links you'll need to access the applications.
The $625 fee ($500 new application fee & $125 hearing notice fee) is payable to the City of Framingham
or by cash only. The Licensing Office schedules and advertises a hearing with the Board of License
Commissioners. The Board typically meets the first and third Monday of the month at 7:00 p.m.
The applicant must notify direct abutters and schools, hospitals & churches within 500' of the proposed
restaurant/package store within three days of the legal notice being published in the newspaper using
certified mail. Submit an abutters request online this link: [URL: "https://epay.cityhallsystems.com/"] https://epay.cityhallsystems.com/ . The list
will be sent to the Licensing Office and forwarded to the applicant.
The Licensing Office provides the legal notice to the newspaper and to the applicant who must send it
the listed abutters via Certified Mail Return Receipt Requested. Prior to the hearing an Affidavit of
Notice of Mailing to Abutter & Others must be submitted. This or a similar form with the same
information must be provided to the Licensing Office prior to the hearing.

TO-ABUTTER-AND-OTHERS?bidId=
The Board expects the applicant, proposed Manager, and/or a representative at a minimum to attend
the hearing with the Board of License Commissioners. 
If the Board approves the license, the Licensing Office sends the ABCC application and required
documents to the State for approval. The ABCC can take approximately six to eight weeks to render a
decision.
Employees engaged in serving or selling alcohol must understand and comply with the Framingham's
Rules & Regulations Governing Alcoholic Beverages.

Before the alcohol license can be issued, the applicant will need to provide proof of Liquor Liability
Insurance in the form of a Certificate.
Excerpt Mass. General Laws Ch. 138 §12:
No license shall be issued or renewed under this section until the applicant or licensee provides
proof of coverage under a liquor legal liability insurance policy for bodily injury or death for a
minimum amount of $250,000 on account of injury to or death of 1 person, and $500,000 on
account of any 1 accident resulting in injury to or death of more than 1 person. Proof of the
insurance coverage required by this section shall be made by filing a certificate of insurance in a
form acceptable to the local licensing authority. The insurance shall be subject to sections 5 and
6 of chapter 175A of the General Laws.

Manager & Assistant Manager Amendment Application Process
There is a Framingham portion and a State ABCC portion to change the Manager of Record. The ABCC
fee is $200 payable online. 
Both applications must be submitted to Licensing Office with the $100 Framingham License Amendment
Application fee. Once the Police Department reviews and provides a recommendation, a hearing with
the Board of License Commissioners will be scheduled. If the Board approves the amendment, the
Licensing Coordinator will send the ABCC Manager application and required documents to the State for
a decision. 
Only the Framingham Liquor License Application is required for a Change of Assistant Manager. If this is
the only amendment to an existing license, a hearing is not required. The ABCC does not need to
approve an Assistant Manager.
