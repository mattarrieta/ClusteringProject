Voting Machines and Booths for 9 new precincts and for handicapped accessibility
According to the 2020 Federal Census, the population increased from 68,318 to 72,362. 
On September 2, 2021, City Council voted to add 9 additional precincts to the existing
18 precincts. Each of the nine precincts requires a separate vote tabulator. 
New voting booths are required for the 9 additional precincts added as well as replacing
the current booths. Also, adding more booths designed for persons with disabilities. 
The current voting booths need replacement due to shelf-life, conditions, and
storage/set-up issues. This purchase will standardize the voting booths used by the
City of Framingham. In addition, new voting booths for persons with disabilities can be
placed at each precinct as opposed to one at each voting location.

Climate Action Plan $138,075 General Fund
Capital Projects & Facilities Management 
Climate Action Plan Development of Blueprint to Establish Actions
The requested funding will support the development of a comprehensive and holistic
blueprint that establishes clear actions that Framingham can take to reduce its
emissions and improve local resiliency built on detailed best practices research, 
analysis and integration of existing plans in Framingham, and strong community
engagement with a focus on members of our community most impacted by climate
change. 
Framingham’s 2020 Strategic Plan sets a clear objective to align with the
Commonwealth’s target of Net Zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. To
achieve this sizable objective, an actionable blueprint for Framingham to tackle
greenhouse gas emissions, both from municipal and community sources, is critical. With
the implementation of the City's first Sustainability Committee and multiple ongoing
supporting climate planning efforts, it is an advantageous time for the community to
begin development of comprehensive climate action planning. Additionally, 
development of a comprehensive climate action plan would help provide further
definition to priority items identified in Framingham's Community Resiliency Building
(CRB) Workshop Report on climate change. The proposed climate action plan will
utilize community engagement and best practices to identify the critical measures
Framingham should adopt to improve its sustainability, reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, and support local climate resiliency. Development of this plan is important to
supporting the Sustainability Committee as it seeks to make long-term improvements in
local sustainability.

Proposed Scope of Climate Action Planning
Overview
With the increasing regularity of extreme weather and natural and climate-related hazards across
the MetroWest, the City of Framingham recognizes the escalating threat that climate change poses
locally and the dire need for it to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions as part of a global effort. 
To this end, the City was designated through the Commonwealth’s Municipal Vulnerability
Preparedness Program in 2019 for completing a community-wide baseline climate change and
natural hazard vulnerability assessment that drew upon the knowledge and experience of municipal
officials and members of the community. Developed in 2020, the City of Framingham’s Strategic
Plan sets a clear objective to align with the Commonwealth’s Net Zero greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions by 2050. Additionally, alongside the implementation of the community’s first Sustainability
Committee, the City is working on a number of climate planning initiatives centered on enhancing
on energy resiliency and better understanding the impacts of climate change on its Environmental
Justice neighborhoods. 
As the City navigates the path to becoming a Net Zero community, the next core step for
Framingham is to develop a comprehensive and holistic blueprint that incorporates diverse and
representative community-wide perspectives and that establishes clear actions it can take to reduce
its emissions and improve local resiliency. Developed from both the close review of existing plans
and best practices across the country, the blueprint will prioritize its actions based on their contexts
within Framingham – incorporating considerations of their impact, cost, stakeholder support, and
resiliency benefits. By also synthesizing its current climate change planning projects and leveraging
them into a more comprehensive plan, this holistic blueprint will consider the co-benefits of climate
mitigation and work toward a more resilient and equitable future for all of Framingham’s residents. 
This document provides the proposed Scope of Work through which an experienced consultant such
as the MAPC could support the City of Framingham’s comprehensive climate action planning process. 
If approved, elements of the proposed project will be shaped closely by the feedback of the
Framingham Sustainability Committee and by criteria of grant funding opportunities that may
present opportunities to reduce municipal expenditures toward development of the plan. The
proposed plan is currently divided into several phases reflecting the strong focus on the
development of an effective engagement strategy leading up to the development of the plan. The
currently proposed phases are as follows: 
•  Phase 1: Stakeholder Mapping, Internal Capacity Building, and Baseline Data Collection
•  Phase 2: (A) Community Engagement and (B) Climate Action Plan Development

Phase 1: Stakeholder Mapping, Internal Capacity Building, and Baseline Data Collection
The first phase of the climate action planning process will involve the development of a community
engagement plan and Climate Action Plan (CAP) Working Group to craft effective strategies for
the City connect with residents. This phase of the plan would also involve the necessary baseline
data collection to inform the mitigation and resiliency measures selected as well as development of
branding and outward facing launch materials. Recent and ongoing climate planning efforts such
as through the MVP Program and with the MAPC will serve as core components in this phase of plan
development.

Capital Projects & Facilities Management 
Green Communities Projects for Efficient and Clean Energy Measures 
The requested funding will support the City’s application for the next Green
Communities Competitive Grant round in 2022 and assist the City in accelerating its
implementation of cost-effective energy efficiency and clean energy measures. 
CPFM requests funding for Green Communities annually to support the implementation
of energy efficiency and clean energy measures across its municipal facilities. 
Requested funding is important to not only backing the City's grant request from the
Department of Energy Resources, but also to enable CPFM to continue making
progress towards energy goals if it is not awarded funding through the program given
increasing annual competition from across the state as more communities enroll in the
program. As in prior years, CPFM will seek for the most cost-effective and highest-
impact projects to maximize use of this funding. Proposals attached represent the types
of projects that CPFM intends to move forward, however, they may be supplemented or
replaced by more cost effective or more impactful projects identified through ongoing
energy analysis of municipal facilities and the municipal fleet.

RE: Proposal for Turnkey Occupancy Sensor Upgrade at Cameron Middle School
Dear Shawn, 
B2Q is pleased to provide you with this proposal to add occupancy sensors and off-hours HVAC
override buttons at Cameron Middle School located at 215 Elm St in Framingham, MA. B2Q has
surveyed the facility with the intent of developing projects for which the City can submit requests
for Green Communities Act grant funding. Our intent is that this project will help the City meet
its energy reduction goals, while still maintaining comfortable conditions for students and staff
alike. 
ECONOMICS SUMMARY 
The estimated economics for this project are given in the table below. B2Q intends to submit a
custom incentive application to Eversource to reduce the net cost to the City and the Green
Communities Act grant may cover up to the remainder of the project cost after utility incentive. 
Please note that there is no published formula for custom incentives but B2Q’s experience has
been that $0.18/kWh and $1.50/therm have been reasonable estimates on comparable projects
and we have therefore used these values in the tables below.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
The scope of work of this proposal is a combination of two energy conservation measures
identified by City staff and evaluated by B2Q and AEM Controls during our recent site visit. These
are summarized below. 
•  Install HVAC Occupancy Sensors – according to conversations with City staff, we
understand that the HVAC for the classrooms is scheduled to run in occupied mode from
6:00 am to 5:00 pm weekdays based on the times that the earliest teacher arrives and the
latest teacher leaves; however, according to staff, we understand that the majority of
faculty do not arrive this early or leave this late. Additionally, a number of classrooms are
unoccupied during the course of the school day as students move to other spaces for
lunch, gym, music class, etc. and teachers have free periods. Based upon potential funding
available from the Green Communities program, we have estimated that (10) classrooms
could be retrofitted with occupancy sensors as part of this project. Each of these
classrooms is served by a dedicated VAV box fed by AHU-1. Our savings estimates are
based on the following typical occupancy profile. Note that the percentage values
represent the fraction of classrooms with an occupancy sensor that are estimated to be
unoccupied during the given hour.

•  Install Occupancy Override Buttons – according to conversations with City staff, we
understand that the HVAC for several of the larger spaces in the building, such as the gym
and auditorium, are scheduled to be occupied on some nights and weekends to
accommodate extra-curricular activities; however, these activities often do not occur as
often or for as long as the HVAC is occupied. This measure proposes to install occupancy
override push buttons for the thermostat in each of these spaces. Once installed, the
AHUs serving these spaces would no longer need to be scheduled to run on any nights or
weekends and when a group does arrive for an activity, they can push the button to
automatically bring the AHU on to run for 2 – 4 hours. If the timer expires and the activity
is still on-going, then another occupant can push the button a second time. We propose
to deploy this strategy for the auditorium and the two units that serve the gym. For the
purposes of estimating energy savings, using the events information provided by the city, 
we have estimated the following based and proposed case runtime schedules for the
applicable AHUs.

The proposed structure of the project is that B2Q would deliver this project to the City of
Framingham via a turnkey project delivery model. This means that the City would only need to
have one contract and write one purchase order for this project. B2Q would hire the controls
contractor as a subcontractor and would pay them out of the single purchase order provided by
the City. B2Q proposes to work with AEM Solutions (Marlborough, MA) for controls and electrical
contracting work. In addition to hiring and managing the subcontractors, B2Q would provide the
following services. 
•  Energy savings analysis and calculations to a level of detail and accuracy that is typically
required by Eversource. 
•  Eversource utility incentive applications.

RE: Proposal for Turnkey Occupancy Sensor Upgrade at Potter Road Elementary School
Dear Shawn, 
B2Q is pleased to provide you with this proposal to add HVAC occupancy sensors at Potter Road
Elementary School located at 492 Potter Rd in Framingham, MA. B2Q has surveyed the facility
with the intent of developing projects for which the City can submit requests for Green
Communities Act grant funding. Our intent is that this project will help the City meet its energy
reduction goals, while still maintaining comfortable conditions for students and staff alike. 
ECONOMICS SUMMARY 
The estimated economics for this project are given in the table below. B2Q intends to submit a
custom incentive application to Eversource to reduce the net cost to the City and the Green
Communities Act grant may cover up to the remainder of the project cost after utility incentive. 
Please note that there is no published formula for custom incentives but B2Q’s experience has
been that $0.18/kWh and $1.50/therm have been reasonable estimates on comparable projects
and we have therefore used these values in the tables below.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
The scope of work of this proposal is a combination of two energy conservation measures
identified by City staff and evaluated by B2Q and AEM Controls during our recent site visit. These
are summarized below. 
•  Install HVAC Occupancy Sensors – according to conversations with City staff, we
understand that the HVAC for the cafetorium is scheduled to run in occupied mode from
6:00 am to 6:00 pm weekdays based on the times that the earliest staff arrives and the
latest staff leaves; however, according to staff, we understand that on most days, the
space is only occupied for lunch periods during the middle of the day and for occasional
program events in the afternoon. Based on the size of the room, we estimate that two
sensors would be needed to achieve full coverage and the sensors would be wired in
parallel so that the whole space is occupied if any one sensor reads occupied and the
whole space would be unoccupied only if both sensors read unoccupied. Our savings
estimates are based on the following typical occupancy profile.

The proposed structure of the project is that B2Q would deliver this project to the City of
Framingham via a turnkey project delivery model. This means that the City would only need to
have one contract and write one purchase order for this project. B2Q would hire the controls
contractor as a subcontractor and would pay them out of the single purchase order provided by
the City. B2Q proposes to work with AEM Solutions (Marlborough, MA) for controls and electrical
contracting work. In addition to hiring and managing the subcontractors, B2Q would provide the
following services. 
•  Energy savings analysis and calculations to a level of detail and accuracy that is typically
required by Eversource. 
•  Eversource utility incentive applications. 
•  Contractor observation during programming. 
•  Green Communities Act grant applications. 
•  Commissioning of the newly-programmed sequences and new equipment to verify
proper operation
•  Project management throughout construction, including construction schedule, and
coordination with the City
•  Training of City staff, by B2Q and our subcontractor, on how to use the new system
•  Record documentation, including warranty letter

City of Framingham FY23-27 Capital Improvement Program 
FY23 Recommended: 
Engine 3 Fire Truck Replacement $816,844 General Fund
Fire Department
Replacement of 2008 Pierce Engine 3
Engine 3 was built in 2008 by Pierce, is the oldest primary response truck serving the
City, and will be approximately 14 years old if replacement is funded in FY23. Engine 3
covers the South side of the City, having the greatest density of occupancies, and large
share of the Fire Department’s calls. The emergency-vehicle certified mechanics have
suggested that the current Engine 3 now has a useful life of 1 year or less. This project
would address the need to get primary response fire trucks on a standardized
replacement cycle. The Department finds that firefighter safety risks and maintenance
costs accelerate when the apparatus have reached 10-12 years of service. This project
also includes the cost to equip the new truck with the required firefighter tools and hose
that a fire engine needs to meet national fire service standards.

RE: Budget Letter for One Pierce Enforcer 1500 GPM Pumper and One Pierce Enforcer HDR
Chief Dutcher, 
Please accept this letter outlining what I will forecast as a budget number for the purchase of a
Pierce Enforcer® 1500 GPM Pumper and a Pierce Enforcer® Heavy-Duty Rescue Truck for the
fiscal year 2023. 
Using the 2021 Framingham Pumper offering unit that is currently in production as a basis for
this design, with a five percent annual forecasted increase rate year over year, I will forecast the
cost of a pumper unit in FY23 to be seven hundred sixty thousand, one hundred and -forty five
dollars. ($760,145.00) This budget price reflects a price increases if this purchase is made after
January 15th, 2022. 
As for the request of a budget number to support the potential purchase of a new Heavy-Duty
Rescue Truck, I would forecast this at a price of eight hundred ninety-five thousand, five
hundred and forty-five dollars. ($895,545.00) 
Please keep in mind this number does not yet reflect any pre-payment discounts. It is however an
HGAC estimated quote. Which also includes two factory trips for three FFD personal, a
performance bond and four days of training on each unit. 
Chief, as you well know many factors can come into play between now and the next twelve
months as to cost drivers or even savings. Obviously if the cost is favorable this would be
reflected in our bid presentation and the same if the market adjusted upward greater than five
percent. The market has been extremely volatile thus far in 2021
We are grateful that we have had the opportunity to serve the City of Framingham Fire
Department, its Membership and the City. We look forward to a continued relationship and the
opportunity to earn your future business. You are a valued customer to Allegiance Fire & Rescue
and Pierce Manufacturing. 
If there is anything else that I can assist you with regarding this matter, please feel free to contact
me.

City of Framingham FY23-27 Capital Improvement Program 
FY23 Recommended: 
Fire Shift Commander (Car 2) Replacement $61,827 General Fund
Fire Department
Replacement of 2015 Ford Expedition 
Car 2 is used by the on-duty Shift Commander (Deputy Chief) on a 24/7 basis. 
Replacement has been deferred for four consecutive years (FY19, FY20, FY21, FY22).
This vehicle responds with the Deputy to all Fire Department calls when multiple
resources are activated. The rear compartment contains incident command post
equipment including 2 additional radios, command boards and command equipment. 
The current Car 2 is a 2015 Ford Expedition. The vehicle utilizes older technology
electronics that draws a huge power demand, and must remain running in idle for long
durations at activations, leading to increasing frequency of taking the vehicle out of
service for repairs. The current Car 2 would be repurposed within the Fire Department
fleet to replace a fleet vehicle with the highest mileage/hours.

Firefighters Gear Replacement (Phase 1 of 3) $35,976 General Fund 
Fire Department
Replacement of 12 sets of Firefighters Gear (Replacement Cycle Phase 1 of 3) 
This request is for the first phase of a three-phase project to replace firefighter gear
used by firefighters - including bunker coat/pants, helmet and boots. National fire
service standards limit the use of such protective equipment to 10-12 years of service. 
It is important that firefighter protective gear keep up with the modern technologies of
biohazard and chemical resistance, as well as resistance to the higher heat fires caused
by the increasing plastic fuel loads found in modern property interiors. The current set
of gear was purchased in 2011 or earlier.

Technology Learning and Expanded Homework Center $150,000 General Fund
Library
Phase 2 of Library Space Plan Technology and Homework Center
Now what would a new teen space look like? Our initial vision involves lots of open
space for sitting/working/reading/gaming/hanging out, as well as more shelving for
collections, especially the fast growing and very popular manga, graphic novel, anime, 
and video game collections. We would use new shelving to do more displays (face out
books always check out better than spine out), make the shelves look more attractive
(not so packed), and leave room for expansion and new formats. We know the glass
serpentine wall surrounding the Teen Room at the new Branch Library works
exceptionally well to provide a safe, welcoming, and “contained” space for Teens to call
their own. We would like to replicate this successful concept for the new Teen Area. 
The “diner booth” in the current teen area is always popular, so we can envision two of
those, as well as dedicated study/group project spaces for teens who need quiet, or for
tutors working with students, and groups of students working on projects. If these
spaces had monitors/smart boards, even better! We would plan space for 8
computers, and add a gaming station with video game systems to play, and directed
sound speakers mounted on the ceiling to mitigate noise. For furniture, we would plan
on comfortable, modular seating and tables that could be moved around the room as
needed
According to data from the US Census Bureau from 2018, 13% of children under the
age of 18 are living in poverty. According to data from the US Department of Housing
and Urban Development, we know that most of those children live in South
Framingham, where our Main Library is located. Data collected by the Young Adult
Services Library Association shows that nationwide, teens as an age group receive the
least financial support and that approximately 14,000 middle and high school students
are on their own after they leave school for the day. Here in Framingham, we have
3,417 teen Framingham Public Library card holders. This number is growing. We know
these kids need a safe, welcoming place for them to go after school, on the weekends, 
and during the summer--a place designed for them and where they’ll find the resources
they need to succeed academically, paving a path to success in adulthood. That’s why
we are starting our space redesign with a new Teen Room, which will better serve this
important demographic’s needs for new and more discoverable collections, new
technology for academic, creative, and recreational pursuits, new comfortable
furnishings, and new opportunities for group and individual study, programming, and
social connection.

Main Library Space Plan Description
FY22-FY25 
Each morning, nearly every day of the year, the Framingham Public Library opens its doors to
the public, offering education, enrichment, and access to resources and meeting space for our
entire community. We welcome all, regardless of income level, socio-economic status, age, 
physical ability, religion, race, housing status or immigration status. In a world of growing
income disparity, skyrocketing costs of education and housing, and a predominantly
technology-based, electronic landscape of resources--often cost prohibitive to access--the
library emerges now more than ever as among the most important public institutions in our
communities. 
No longer exclusively repositories for books, libraries are serving as centers for community. In
an increasingly electronic and virtual world, society finds itself more isolated and fragmented, 
but the library provides a shared space for connection, social engagement, inquiry, civil
discourse, and access to trusted, factual information. As the library grows and changes to
respond to these needs, we must reassess our physical space to ensure we are meeting patron
expectations. Located in the heart of Downtown Framingham, the Main Library was
constructed in 1979. Since then, the building has not seen any major interior upgrades or
interior design projects, nor have we undertaken a holistic space redesign with modern services
and technology in mind. The time has come now to take this on. 
Working with the "Framingham Public Library Main Building Needs Re-assessment" report
produced from a space study conducted by Patience Jackson in October 2018, the Library will
undertake and realize a project-based, section by section, interior redesign plan. The project
will proceed as follows: 
Phase 1 FY22
Teen Area 
According to data from the US Census Bureau from 2018, 13% of children under the age of 18
are living in poverty. According to data from the US Department of Housing and Urban
Development, we know that most of those children live in South Framingham, where our Main
Library is located. Data collected by the Young Adult Services Library Association shows that
nationwide, teens as an age group receive the least financial support and that approximately
14,000 middle and high school students are on their own after they leave school for the day. 
Here in Framingham, we have 3,417 teen Framingham Public Library card holders. This number
is growing. We know these kids need a safe, welcoming place for them to go after school, on
the weekends, and during the summer--a place designed for them and where they’ll find the
resources they need to succeed academically, paving a path to success in adulthood. That’s why
we are starting our space redesign with a new Teen Room, which will better serve our this
important demographic’s needs for new and more discoverable collections, new technology for
academic, creative, and recreational pursuits, new comfortable furnishings, and new
opportunities for group and individual study, programming, and social connection.

Phase 2 FY23
Technology Learning Center and Homework Center 
For nine years, the Homework Center at the Framingham Public Library has been helping
students from kindergarten through senior year with homework, projects, skill-building, and
test taking. This powerful program has made a tremendous difference in the lives of
Framingham students who have benefited from free, drop-in access to excellent tutors in a
welcoming space, ready to help them succeed academically. This access can be truly life
changing, especially for children and families struggling financially for whom paid tutoring is out
of reach. The Homework Center provides not just homework help, but support for test taking, 
such as SAT prep, which is critical to successful outcomes necessary for college admission. Fees
set by commercial SAT prep companies are high and cost prohibitive for many families. The
Homework Center program has grown considerably over the past nine years, not only in the
numbers it serves but in its activities as well. With special programs like Math Camp, Coding
Club, and Robotics Day (among others) the Homework Center is providing skill-building
enrichment experiences that require access to the latest technology and a more appropriate
instruction area. The Homework Center’s current space is often overflowing with tutors and
students and there is an insufficient number of computer workstations. Our plan is to create a
Computer Lab Classroom where Homework Center students (and all other patrons) can take
advantage of computers, presentation equipment and other technology to facilitate instruction
and learning. Additionally, locating small, enclosed study rooms nearby equipped with
technology and plug-in capability will help our tutors and students find space to do their work. 
Technology Learning Center 
Libraries have always been about education. Books and expert research help and advice have
always been available, but as the skill sets necessary for success in modern life grow in number
and complexity, libraries and librarians are engaging in a deeper level of instruction and are
providing a bridge over the gap many people experience between those necessary skills and
success and fulfilment. Many of our most popular programs involve instruction, whether in
computer skills like Microsoft Excel and Word, Facebook and social media and device
instruction, to like skills like financial literacy, resume building and job seeking, or workshops on
entrepreneurship. Access to this instruction is important in the lives of all our community
members, regardless of age and ability, and we are committed to providing it. For example, we
are seeking a grant from the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners to develop a
program in partnership with Framingham State University to create a satellite campus
downtown at the Main Library, which would offer access to courses, free to all. Success of the
“DowtownU,” as we’re calling it, depends in large part on having the appropriate materials and
space conducive to instruction and learning. Our planned Computer Lab Classroom is essential
for the program’s success. 
Phase 3 FY24
Literacy Unlimited Area 
As they acclimate to their new surroundings, it doesn’t take long before immigrants new to
Framingham and the US find their way to the Framingham Public Library. This is thanks in large
44
Page 45
part to the reputation of Literacy Unlimited as a free and readily available resource poised to
help provide an important foothold in success in a new country--free English Language Learning
opportunities. Despite the fantastic work the program does, its current space is insufficient for
its 232 tutors and 332 students and their activities. The program has close to 200 tutor/student
pairs, who need space for one-on-one tutoring and instruction. Additionally, Literacy Unlimited
conducts 12 drop-in conversation classes per week, which frequently overflow the small
conference room available in the current space. Extremely popular and well attended, 
conversation classes are an alternative to those on the waiting list to be paired with a tutor. 
They also provide a critical lifeline for people looking for support and connection in a new
country. 
Also among the goals for the redesign of the Literacy Unlimited Area, is to better integrate one
of the most vibrant and popular programs we offer into the larger Library space and activity. 
We currently have ELL (English Language Learning) materials in our Citizenship Corner on the
third floor by the reference desk, far from Literacy Unlimited’s space on the first floor. Our new
plan will locate the Citizenship Corner, ELL materials and collections with the Literacy Unlimited
instruction and office space. Bringing Literacy Unlimited into the central library space and out of
its current location off the beaten path, will create a more welcoming environment and
increase access and discovery for the patrons it serves, especially those with limited English
skills. 
Phase 4 FY25
Magazines and Periodicals Browsing Area:
Our Periodicals Section with the latest Magazines and Newspapers, is an important browsing
collection, well utilized by all but particularly our senior population. According to census data, 
40% of Framingham residents fall into the 60-84 age range and 41% fall into the 85 and older
range. We are committed to serving our growing senior population with collections, 
programming, educational opportunities, and with Bookmobile services. Easy access with
special attention to accommodating mobility and visual impairments is especially important. 
Our current Periodicals area is located on the third floor of the Library, which makes access to
those with mobility limitations challenging. Bringing the Periodicals area to the first floor, 
installing comfortable, accessible furniture and shelving will create much better experience for
all. Further, the Main Floor of the Library should be an inviting space, one that sends a message
to our patrons that they are welcome to sit, spend time, and use the collection and materials at
their leisure and convenience. A comfortable, accessible browsing and seating area for seniors
(and others) to enjoy is a necessary part of the space redesign.

Technology & Learning Center (Commons?) at Framingham Public Library
The Technology & Learning Center will be a shared composite space with an assortment of
technology and furnishings designed to facilitate different types of learning. The purpose of TLC
is to provide a state of the art learning environment conducive to lifelong curiosity and
exploration. TLC will stimulate the individual exploration of technologies, encourage the
advancement of our community’s digital literacy, and offer collaborative curriculum and learning
opportunities that will improve the quality of life for our community
We envision two distinct areas inside the walls of TLC, with some comfortable seating and
tables on the periphery. The first area will be more of a classroom setting with a shared table
space where users can spread out laptops, Chromebooks or other devices depending on the
content of the presentation or project. There will be plenty of access to power and connectivity, 
and large, connected monitors for shared viewing and instruction, either on the table itself, on
the wall, or both. Individual workspaces will include smaller, more private stations where users
can bring their own devices, borrow one from TLC or access one of the full workstations
designed for a variety of purposes including tasks ranging from simple word processing and
data input to graphics designing and CAD. There will be printing and scanning available inside
TLC. 
TLC will be staffed with an instructor during classroom hours, offer more freeform drop in hours
with tutors available and make-available technologies appropriate for all ages ranging from
preschool to senior citizens and every demographic between.

Introducing the Technology & Learning Center at Framingham Public Library: 
A Life-changing Learning Space Free and Open to All 
One of the joys of visiting the public library is the opportunity to roam, browse, and
explore the collections, allowing serendipity to be the day's teacher and guide. But with
the creation of the Technology & Learning Center, the Framingham Public Library wants
to take learning to a next level by creating a formalized classroom environment--
a learning hub, designed to conduct instruction and life-changing learning. Drawing on
the resources the library already enjoys-- excellent collections and comfortable, 
accessible spaces; plus a staff of expert professional librarians joined by a
community of first-rate educators and volunteers who are experts in their field, the
Framingham Public Library is poised to create a true "Downtown U," free and open to all
that can lead to transformative skill-building and learning 
Imagine creating a state-of-the-art classroom equipped with workstations, 
presentation and instruction tools, and collaborative workspaces designed to inspire and
facilitate learning, build opportunity, and enrich the lives of visitors with new knowledge, 
marketable skills and abilities. 
What can you learn? 
The sky's the limit!

These funds will be used to replace two trucks, a front-end loader, ad a large mower
that are well past their useful life expectancy and present life-safety concerns to City
staff. The Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division is respectfully requesting Capital
Funding for the Vehicle and Equipment Replacement Program. The FY2023
Replacement Program includes replacement of two trucks that are 14 and 15 years old; 
a tractor that is 16 years old; and a large mower that is 13 years old. Replacement of
these vehicles and equipment would allow the Department to replace the most deficient, 
and oldest equipment that poses life safety concerns and operational inefficiencies. 
This proposal includes replacement of a Ford F450 Crew Cab Dump Truck (truck 11) 
and a Ford F450 Regular Cab Dump Truck (truck 12). These two trucks are normally
used heavily throughout the fleet on a daily basis. These trucks support year-round
operational needs including moving equipment and materials throughout the City; 
supporting mowing operations; providing snow removal and sanding operational support
during winter months; and transporting crews from site to site. These trucks are both
past their life expectancy, required costly repairs to pass state inspections, require
additional funding to repair issues, and have begun to rot out in the cab, allowing for
fume infiltration into the cab which creates life safety issues. 
Additionally, our proposal includes replacement of our Toro Groundsmaster (equipment
37), and Case Loader (equipment 24). These two pieces of equipment are also utilized
heavily throughout the year on a daily process and have surpassed its life expectancy. 
The Toro Groundsmaster is a large mower that is used 8-9 months of the year on a
daily basis. This mower supports operations at a number of facilities throughout the City
and is a unique piece of equipment. The Toro is one of the only pieces of equipment in
51
Page 52
fleet that travels throughout the City on roads, instead of being transported by trailer. 
This leaves the mower susceptible to suspension damage due to pot holes and rough
streets. Additionally, this mower is relied upon heavily throughout the year and allows
the Department to experience a number of efficiencies while it is operational. The Case
Loader is also used heavily in a number of aspects throughout the City. The Loader
support field maintenance operations, construction projects, field improvements, snow
removal, and support operations at the Maintenance and Operations Facility. Both of
these pieces of equipment have experiences costly failures that are lingering and
require additional repairs/replacements that will be need to ensure it meets safety
standards and remains in fleet. These repairs total more than the current estimated
value of each, and require replacement. Without these two pieces of equipment, our
Department will experience a decrease in operational efficiencies and large
expenditures on continually failing equipment.

including moving equipment and materials throughout the City; supporting mowing operations; 
providing snow removal and sanding operational support during winter months; and
transporting crews from site to site. These trucks are both past their life expectancy, required
costly repairs to pass state inspections, require additional funding to repair issues, and have
begun to rot out in the cab, allowing for fume infiltration into the cab which creates life safety
issues. 
Additionally, our proposal includes replacement of our Toro Groundsmaster (equipment 37),
and Case Loader (equipment 24). These two pieces of equipment are also utilized heavily
throughout the year on a daily process and have surpassed its life expectancy. The Toro
Groundsmaster is a large mower that is used 8-9 months of the year on a daily basis. This
mower supports operations at a number of facilities throughout the City and is a unique piece
of equipment. The Toro is one of the only pieces of equipment in fleet that travels throughout
the City on roads, instead of being transported by trailer. This leaves the mower susceptible to
suspension damage due to pot holes and rough streets. Additionally, this mower is relied upon
heavily throughout the year and allows the Department to experience a number of efficiencies
while it is operational. The Case Loader is also used heavily in a number of aspects throughout
the City. The Loader support field maintenance operations, construction projects, field
improvements, snow removal, and support operations at the Maintenance and Operations
Facility. Both of these pieces of equipment have experiences costly failures that are lingering
and require additional repairs/replacements that will be need to ensure it meets safety
standards and remains in fleet. These repairs total more than the current estimated value of
each, and require replacement. Without these two pieces of equipment, our Department will 
53

experience a decrease in operational efficiencies and large expenditures on continually failing
equipment. 
For these many reasons, the Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division respectfully requests
FY23 Capital Budget funding for the Vehicle and Equipment Replacement Program. Division
staff will be made available to provide additional information and address any questions, as
needed.

RE: Capital Budget Vehicle Replacement – 2006 Ford F450 Crew Cab Dump Truck
Chris, 
As requested, the following is a description of the current issues with the 2006 Ford F450 4x4 Crew
Cab Dump Truck. Currently, this vehicle has 71,397 miles on the odometer, which converts to
107,096 engine miles (1 mile equals 1.5 engine miles).
Currently, the usage of this vehicle has been greatly reduced due to its current condition and safety
risks. Current issues requiring attention, labor and expense are: 
•  Repair of engine oil leak at the back of engine; 
•  Replacement of the oil pan; 
Truck 11 is heavily relied upon within the Department throughout the year. This truck provides
support to our ballfield maintenance and lining operations that service over 60 lined fields
seasonally. This vehicle is heavily used year round and supports maintenance projects throughout
the winter when lining operations are completed for the year. As a result of this continued daily
usage, this truck has required continued repairs and replacements to ensure it remains on the road
and in operations. Specifically, the Department has undertaken a majority of these repairs using
in-house staff; however, some repairs have required the vehicle be send to third party mechanics, 
costing the Department roughly $1,100 over the past few years. In addition to these mechanical
issues, rust has begun infiltrating the rocker panels and bottom of the doors, resulting in staff
becoming exposed to fumes and weather while driving the truck. 
After 16 years of operational service, the overall physical and mechanical condition of the vehicle is
significantly degraded. Based on an overall assessment of the vehicle, I believe it has reached its
useful life expectancy and would recommend replacement. 
Regards, 
Donald Capen

RE: Capital Budget Vehicle Replacement – 2007 Ford F450 Regular Cab Dump
Truck
Chris, 
As requested, the following is a description of the current issues with the 2007 Ford F450 4x4 Regular
Cab Dump Truck. Currently, this vehicle has 58,410 miles on the odometer, which converts to 87,615
engine miles (1 mile equals 1.5 engine miles).
Currently, the usage of this vehicle has been greatly reduced due to its current condition and safety
risks. Current issues requiring attention, labor and expense are: 
•  Repair of engine oil leak at the back of engine; 
During the winter months, Truck 12 has been used in snow removal/treatment operations. As
part of this, Truck 12 carries a bed-mounted sander during these months to treat City properties. 
As a result of operating in support of snow removal efforts during the past 14 years, this vehicle
has sustained significant salt erosion to its frame and bed mounts. Over the past five years, the
Division has expended $22,000 on repairs. During 2019-2020, the vehicle required replacement
of the tie-rods, ball joint, tires, alternator, and break repairs in an attempt to keep this functioning
in fleet, specifically for snow removal operations. There are still significant mechanical and
structural issues with this vehicle that will need to be addressed in the coming year. 
After 14 years of operational service, the overall physical and mechanical condition of the vehicle is
significantly degraded. Based on an overall assessment of the vehicle, I believe it has reached its
useful life expectancy and would recommend replacement.

Memorandum 
From the desk of Donald Capen
August 29, 2021 
RE: Capital Budget Vehicle Replacement – 2005 Case MXT 570 Loader
Chris, 
As requested, the following is a description of the current issues with the 2005 Case MXT 570 Loader. 
Currently, this vehicle hours tracker is damaged to the point of failure and no longer counts usage
hours. The last record we have of usage is from 2019, when the tracker indicated usage of 6,959
hours, which converts to 10,439 engine miles using the industry standard of 1 engine hour equaling 35
miles. 
Due to the amount of engine hours accrued by the case loader and the current condition, it has
routinely failed over the last year. This has required costly repairs as well as significant setbacks to the
daily operational needs of the Parks Maintenance Department. This loader is heavily used at our
maintenance building to help with daily operations, but due to its current state we have to limit what
we are able to do. 
The condition of this tractor has continued to decline to the point of complete failure. Specifically, the
cab requires full replacement, and new doors to not only pass inspection but to ensure safety of our
staff. Major safety issues have arisen due to the current condition, including inflation of engine fumes, 
exhaust and weather into the cab during operation. The cab and door replacement costs for just parts is
estimated at $22,000 without labor. Additionally, the Department has expended $7,700 on repairs
during the past 5 years to ensure continued usage. At this point, the estimated cost for parts alone is
much higher than the total value of this machine. 
After 17 years of operational service, the overall physical and mechanical condition of the tractor is
significantly degraded. Based on an overall assessment of the tractor, I believe it has reached its
useful daily life expectancy and would recommend immediate replacement.

Memorandum 
From the desk of Donald Capen
August 18, 2021 
RE: Capital Budget Vehicle Replacement – Jacobson Gang Mower
This mower is for cutting all the athletic field and are large parcel of land . this mower is very important to
keep up maintaining grass heights to a level of playability on our athletic fields . this machine has had
some issues with the motor in the past years and the people at Toro have said the motor on this machine
has had major failure to it . we have spent 4,000 dollars in the last 5 years . this mower has become a
secondary mower for us in the last couple of years because of the motor 
Chris, 
As requested, the following is a description of the current issues with the 2007 Ford F450 4x4 Regular
Cab Dump Truck. Currently, this vehicle has 58,410 miles on the odometer, which converts to 87,615
engine miles (1 mile equals 1.5 engine miles).
Currently, the usage of this vehicle has been greatly reduced due to its current condition and safety
risks. Current issues requiring attention, labor and expense are: 
•  Repair of engine oil leak at the back of engine; 
During the winter months, Truck 12 has been used in snow removal/treatment operations. As
part of this, Truck 12 carries a bed-mounted sander during these months to treat City properties. 
As a result of operating in support of snow removal efforts during the past 14 years, this vehicle
has sustained significant salt erosion to its frame and bed mounts. Over the past five years, the
Division has expended $22,000 on repairs. During 2019-2020, the vehicle required replacement
of the tie-rods, ball joint, tires, alternator, and break repairs in an attempt to keep this functioning
in fleet, specifically for snow removal operations. There are still significant mechanical and
structural issues with this vehicle that will need to be addressed in the coming year. 
After 14 years of operational service, the overall physical and mechanical condition of the vehicle is
significantly degraded. Based on an overall assessment of the vehicle, I believe it has reached its
useful life expectancy and would recommend replacement. 
Regards, 
Donald Capen

FY23 Recommended: 
Temple Street Playground Replacement/Improvement $140,000 General Fund
Parks & Recreation
Installation of new and accessible equipment, grounds and pathway improvements
The Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division is respectfully requesting Capital
Funding for the Temple Street Playground Replacement Project. This project will consist
of the removal of the current equipment; installation of new, accessible equipment; 
safety surfacing; fencing; and accessible pathways. This project would focus on
improvements while working to maintain the nature of this neighborhood park. 
The current play equipment is past its life expectancy and requires replacement. 
Additionally, the current equipment is not accessible, and lacks a proper accessible
route to connect all park visitors to the equipment. The current location of the play
equipment is along Temple Street and is not fenced in, creating potential long-term
safety concerns. These deficiencies have led the Department and a number of residents
from the area, to begin working on conceptual designs for full replacement that would
remedy these issues. 
The current conceptual design will address all of these concerns, including moving the
play equipment to a more centralized location within the park; widening the size of the
park; incorporating accessible equipment into the playground; installation of safety
surfacing; installing perimeter fencing around the newly located playground; and
installing an accessible pathway that will connect the playground with the parking lot. 
This proposal includes funding for continued design, community outreach, and proper
equipment to complete this project. Once these improvements have been completed, 
this playground will be accessible for all residents and provide a safe play area for
numerous age groups to enjoy.

City of Framingham FY23-27 Capital Improvement Program 
FY23 Recommended: 
Fence and Backstop Replacement Program $326,895 General Fund
Parks & Recreation
Phase 1 to replace failing, aged backstops, field fencing and safety fencing in parks
The Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division is respectfully requesting Capital
Funding for Phase 1 of the Fence and Backstop Removal and Replacement Program. 
The previous fence & backstop removal and replacement project was funded over 10
years ago, increasing the need for funding of this project and magnifying the need for
proper investments. 
Properly maintained parks, including vertical structures, are integral to neighborhood
beautification, stabilization, site usability, public safety, and maintaining surrounding
property values. The "Choose Framingham" initiative identifies the fact that "the
average distance to a playground or other recreation area from any single-family parcel
is approximately a quarter of a mile." By replacing fence and backstops at park
locations, we are able to ensure proper management and safety of our parks and other
facilities. 
In addition to maintaining neighborhood parks and other passive recreational facilities
throughout the City, the Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division also maintains all
school athletic fields and their associated fence lines. Parks staff has identified the
need to replace various fence lines due to increased safety concerns that are attributed
to normal aging, tree damage, and regular usage. 
Phase I of the Fence and Backstop Removal and Replacement Program includes
improvements at the following Parks & Recreation maintained properties: 
Removal and replacement of inadequate and undersized fencing at Bowditch Baseball
Diamond: 
Current fences are 4 feet, creating a safety concern for athletes and field users
and leading to injuries of athletes plying in the outfield
Deterioration and age of fences have also created safety concerns 
109
Page 110
Removal and replacement of 16 ft. backstops at two softball fields at the Walsh
Complex: 
These backstops have surpassed their life expectancy and are in desperate need
of replacement
Deterioration due to weather, aging, and usage has left these backstops in poor
condition, creating potential safety concerns for both users and spectators
Inadequate for current usage, as there is no canopy on the top of the backstop at Lower
and Upper Walsh Softball Fields, allowing foul balls to go into spectator sections and
neighboring properties
Installation of wooden guardrail at Cushing Memorial Park, Winter Street parking area: 
Lack of guardrail leaves no protection or separation of Keefe Tech fencing from
vehicles; 
Guardrail will prohibit vehicles from parking along this area, reducing the
possibility of parked vehicles blocking access and eliminating emergency vehicle
corridor; 
Due to continued inflation and fluctuation in the cost of steel, we were unable to procure
accurate pricing for potential FY23 purchase and installation. As such, this proposal is
based off of FY2022 costs with a healthy contingency built in. The Department will
undertake as many of these improvements as possible utilizing the funding approved for
FY23. Any improvements that are not able to be funded will be carried into Phase II of
this project. 
This project has been deferred since FY2010

Fence & Backstop Replacement and Repairs - Phase I
The Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division is respectfully requesting Capital Funding for
Phase 1 of the Fence and Backstop Removal and Replacement Program. The previous fence &
backstop removal and replacement project was funded over 10 years ago, increasing the need for
funding of this project and magnifying the need for proper investments. 
Properly maintained parks, including vertical structures, are integral to neighborhood
beautification, stabilization, site usability, public safety, and maintaining surrounding property
values. The "Choose Framingham" initiative identifies the fact that "the average distance to a
playground or other recreation area from any single family parcel is approximately a quarter of a
mile." By replacing fence and backstops at park locations, we are able to ensure proper
management and safety of our parks and other facilities. 
In addition to maintaining neighborhood parks and other passive recreational facilities
throughout the City, the Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division also maintains all school
athletic fields and their associated fence lines. Parks staff has identified the need to replace
various fence lines due to increased safety concerns that are attributed to normal aging, tree
damage, and regular usage. 
Phase I of the Fence and Backstop Removal and Replacement Program includes improvements
at the following Parks & Recreation maintained properties: 
•  Removal and replacement of inadequate and undersized fencing at Bowditch Baseball
Diamond: 
o Current fences are 4 feet, creating a safety concern for athletes and field users and
leading to injuries of athletes plying in the outfield; 
o Deterioration and age of fences have also created safety concerns; 
•  Removal and replacement of 16 ft. backstops at two softball fields at the Walsh Complex; 
o These backstops have surpassed their life expectancy and are in desperate need of
replacement; 
• Deterioration due to weather, aging, and usage has left these backstops in
poor condition, creating potential safety concerns for both users and
spectators; 
• Inadequate for current usage, as there is no canopy on the top of the
backstop at Lower and Upper Walsh Softball Fields, allowing foul balls to
go into spectator sections and neighboring properties; 
•  Installation of wooden guardrail at Cushing Memorial Park, Winter Street parking area: 
o Lack of guardrail leaves no protection or separation of Keefe Tech fencing from
vehicles; 
o Guardrail will prohibit vehicles from parking along this area, reducing the
possibility of parked vehicles blocking access and eliminating emergency vehicle
corridor;

City of Framingham FY23-27 Capital Improvement Program 
FY23 Recommended: 
Loring Arena Audio Upgrades $100,000 General Fund
Parks & Recreation
Full Replacement of current in-rink audio and PA system
The Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division is respectfully requesting Capital
Funding for the replacement of the current public announcement (PA) system at Loring
Arena. This project will consist of the installation of new speakers and audio system
throughout the rink; installation of controls in the press box and office; and overall
upgrades to the PA system used during games, practices, open skate, and all other
events at Loring Arena. 
The current system is 10 years old and was designed to function in the former rink and
is configured as such. In the former rink, sound was able to reverberate off of the end
walls and bounce back into the rink and spectator sections, providing clear audio for
user’s experience. As a result of the renovations, the material of the end walls have
changed, which has created a challenge in projecting sound throughout the rink. In
addition, the space has changed with the addition of a second floor with windows for
viewing, installation of windows on the four corners of the barrel, and reconfiguration of
the front first floor. The main challenge is usage during spectator events. 
The rink hosts around 60 games a season from September through March, which
generates a large amount of revenue for the City and helps to offset the operational cost
of Loring Arena. What we have found is that during these events when there are
spectators in the stands, the PA system proves to be subpar and is unable to project
any announcements, including pregame ceremonies and singing of the national
anthem. Throughout the 2018-2019 season, the Loring Arena and Parks Department
staff members received numerous complaints from players, coaches, parents, 
spectators, Athletic Directors, presidents of leagues, representatives from the MIAA, 
and so on regarding the subpar PA system. 
When the Department was undertaking redesign efforts for the rink, this upgrade was
considered at the time as a component to the project. However, when estimated
budgets were presented to City staff, we were forced to undertake value engineering
approaches, which resulted in the removal of this project and a number of others from
the overall renovation project. While the renovations have received glowing reviews
from all users and visitors, the lacking PA system has decreased the user experience. 
As a result, we have identified the replacement of the current PA system as a top
priority for Loring Arena. Our goal for this project is to not only improve the user
experience but also to continue to grow the popularity of the rink state-wide by providing
a state-of-the-art experience for all.

STATEMENT OF WORK
Summary:
The City of Framingham is interested in improving the performance and features of the audio system in the main bowl at
the Loring Arena. After location meetings and office discussions, HB is proposing a solution to address these needs.
System Description:
Arena
To create proper audio reinforcement in the bleacher areas of the Arena we have designed a system with a total of fourteen
new column array loudspeakers. Six column loudspeakers will be evenly distributed across each of the two bleacher areas.
These loudspeakers will be suspended directly above the walkway between the dasher boards and the first row of seating.
The loudspeakers will be aimed down at approximately a 30 degree angle to keep reflected energy from the back wall.
The loudspeakers shall be zoned with four loudspeakers in the center of each bleacher area tied together to be Zone 1 and
Zone 2. The outer-most two loudspeakers of each bleacher area shall be tied together and be Zones 3 and 4. An additional
two loudspeakers will be aimed back onto the ice and be Zone 5. If the arena is full, all zones can be active. If the arena is
only half full, other zones can be shut off to keep acoustical energy down and improve intelligibility.
An audio input plate for microphone and line level, and a wall mount button panel will be located in the DJ booth. A duplicate
button panel controller will be located at the audio equipment rack.
Control functions will include:
x  System On/Off
x  Zone 2 Off
x  Zone 3 Off
x  Zone 4 Off
x  Microphone Volume
The installation may require additional electrical work and possibly the use of a lift, both of which will need to be provided
by the City at no cost to HB.

Scheduled service shall be performed for corrective service and emergency maintenance and then only during normal
business hours during normal business days. Normal business hours shall be from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM and normal business
days Monday through Friday, national and local holidays accepted.
HB makes every effort possible to respond to customers’ needs as quickly as possible. Response time from a customer’s
initial call for emergency service is usually within two (2) hours for telephone response and twenty-four (24) hours for on-site
service.
Exclusions
Unless otherwise covered under a manufacturer’s warranty, the remedy of failure caused by the following is excluded from
the Warranty: normal use and wear, hazardous environmental conditions, continual use in excess of manufacturer’s
recommendations and alteration of the system or any of its component parts.
Customer shall be responsible for the costs of any repair or replacement parts resulting from exposure of the equipment to
abnormal acts or operating conditions over and above expected wear and tear such as fire, storm, lightning, theft, physical
abuse, mishandling, vandalism, acts of God, or other causes beyond the reasonable control of HB, for use of a product in an
application other than what the unit was intended for or attempted repairs by anyone other than HB’s personnel or
designated agent.
Such repair or replacement, when requested by the Customer, will be done by HB and billed to the Customer at the published
rate, including parts and labor. HB's standard field service rate is $140.00 per hour during normal business hours, portal to

SERVICE AGREEMENTS
Upon expiration of the Standard Warranty period, future service by HB is provided under Time and Materials terms and fees
applicable at that time unless Customer engages in a Service Agreement. The benefit of HB Service Agreements is that HB
will continue to warrant the workmanship and labor, provide Service Level Agreement (SLA) response time commitments,
and include an agreed number of Preventive Maintenance Visits during the term of the contract.
Service Level Agreements (SLA)
HB offers three maintenance agreements based on varying degrees of service and response times. Of course, plans can be
customized to individual circumstances and needs. Agreements are typically entered into for one to three years.
Strategic Staffing Services
Under an HB Staffing Agreement, HB assigns each Customer one or more HB Audio Visual Support Specialist (AVSS) to assist
in the use and operation of the systems at the customer facility. HB Staff Technicians are an extension of our client’s staff
and report daily to their assigned client site. They are typically responsible for ongoing support for the use and functionality
of audio and video technology, providing support for users, meeting and events, and may be involved in the planning and
implementation of change or new installation of AV, Video, or related solutions at the client location.

ROOM READINESS
The following describes the physical conditions we require at the site in order to bring equipment into the designated area.
These “room ready” conditions have been developed to insure proper site conditions that pose no compromise to the proper
operation and performance of the equipment. Further, they will allow our installers to work at maximum efficiency insuring
timely completion. Where reasonable or possible:
Conduit
Prior to commencement of work by HB, Customer will assure that adequate cable pathways or conduit are furnished. All
conduit may not exceed 40% fill per NEC standards. If HB discovers insufficient conduit capacity, Customer will remedy
without penalty or cost to HB.
120-Volt Power
All permanent 120-volt AC power and work is the responsibility of the Customer and must be in place. This includes the
electrical connection to any electric projection screens. All receptacles must be properly grounded per NEC requirements,
and all circuits must be of sufficient capacity to provide full turn on power to all system racks without tripping breakers.
Location of all 120-volt receptacles must be within reasonable and logical proximity of equipment.
Equipment Delivery
Prior to the delivery of all equipment and electronics, all spaces are “broom-clean” and the site is free of dust and dirt. All
construction, including drywall, painting, ceilings, flooring and millwork is complete. If, at the discretion of the Customer,
equipment is brought to site before it is clean, functionality, longevity and warranties may be compromised.
OSHA Requirements
Prior to commencement of work by HB, the job site must meet OSHA requirements for a healthful workplace. Appropriate
safety policies should be set, maintained, and enforced by all work forces.

CLOSEOUT PROCESS
In order to ensure that the client will be satisfied with a complete project, HB has developed a Closeout Process. This process
ties up any loose ends ensuring that the project is complete.
Final Testing
HB will complete final termination, testing and “de-bugging” of installed systems.
Documentation
All documents referring to the project including spec sheets are handed over to the client for their records.
Equipment Manuals
HB will provide sets of equipment manuals for each piece of equipment in your project.
Training
After equipment has been installed, HB will train the client end users on how to use the systems. Training is scheduled based
on the customer’s schedule.
Installation Sign-Off
HB utilizes an “Installation Sign-Off” form to signify project completion.
This document provides a mechanism for the Owner to acknowledge completion or receipt of beneficial use of the system or
to identify performance exceptions to the system.
HB is able to remedy such exceptions on a timely basis and then identifies the beginning of the warranty period.
Portfolio Consideration
Each client project is important to us and many showcase our quality of work. After project completion, with client’s approval,
HB will schedule a photo shoot featuring the recently installed technology.
In some instances, a formal case study will also be written and posted online or appear in HB marketing materials.
All photos will be available to the client upon request.

Dear Mayor Yvonne Spicer, 
My name is William Ortiz III. I am a high school math teacher and the head coach for boys’ 
varsity hockey at Framingham High School. I am writing on behalf of Framingham High Athletics and the
Framingham boys and girls Hockey Programs to support the proposal to replace the current public
announcement system at Loring Arena. 
The replacement of the PA system is a critical piece of this project that players, parents, 
coaches, and spectators cannot overlook. The current system does not work and it is unfortunate
because the students who sing the national anthem and the folks who frequent the arena deserve
better. 
As the head coach of the boy’s high school hockey program, it is my responsibility to provide my
athletes the best experience possible. In order to carry out these expectations, a PA system that works
properly is needed. The system is needed to provide player announcements, national anthem, senior
night presentation, charity donations, play-by-play commentating, spectator management and the list
can go on. The burden of a terrible PA system paints an image not only on our program but our school
and our city. Parents continue to express their frustrations every year. 
A replacement of the PA system will not only allow the current programs to best utilize the
facility but also allow the spectators the full experience they deserve. On behalf of the athletic
department and the Framingham boy’s and girl’s hockey programs, I fully support the project request
for a new PA system. 
Thank you, 
William Ortiz III

HI Paul,
Loring arena is a beautiful rink to host our hockey games. Just one thing that is not working and sounding up to
par. The sound system is not good. It's very hard to hear what the announcer is trying to say. It's not clear at all
and not loud enough. We like to hear those announcements of who scored and assisted the goals along with the
beginning lineup for each game.
Thanks so much for your consideration.

Hi Paul,

Page 135
As the upcoming hockey season is approaching, we have been recently talking about home games at Loring
Arena. The current sound system leaves fans(home and away) confused and frustrated. No one can understand
the garbled messages that come out of it! It is frustrating for the announcer who tries in vein to get the play
calls conveyed and embarrassing when we are trying to do on-ice presentations, etc. We have a beautiful top
notch facility, but the sound system is not up to par with all the other amenities
I am really excited to hear word that there may be aproposal created for anew sound system for Loring. I am
sure all the other parents on this email will echo my sentiments. If there is going to be an open meeting on the
topic we can attend and help with the cause
Thank you for your support

Hi Paul.
Loring desperately needs a sound system we can actually hear. The arena looks amazing, let's finish the job
with asound system that matches it.
Hoping you can pass this along to whomever makes the decision and let them know.
It would have a huge impact on the experience we have as parents/fans/taxpayers.
Thanks! !i

Hi Paul,
I'm hearing that a formal request is being put together for a new sound system at
Loring.
A bunch of the hockey parents and I were just discussing this very topic the other night
as we were discussing some of the events surrounding the upcoming season.
The existing sound system is impossible to hear from all areas of the facility, making it
very difficult to make announcements during the game. It's the last missing piece to
this beautiful new facility that we are all so proud to have.

Memo
To: Finance Sub Committee
From: James Paolini
cc: 
Date: 10/20/21
Subject Concrete pad replacement at the Police Department 
Here are some bullet points on why the tank pad and access covers need replacement. 
•  The tank itself is in good overall condition, it is a 10,000 gallon double wall fiberglass tank that was installed in 1993. 
The settling of the pad can put undue stress on the tank. 
It is important to keep the pad in good condition to protect the tank. 
•  The pad in its present condition is showing signs of major structural deficiencies, cracking, deterioration and settling. 
There have been repairs and mandatory upgrades over the years that because of age are starting to fail. 
•  The vent connection (orange cover) has settled below grade and is submerged during heavy rain, this could compromise
the fuel stored in the tank. 
•  The main sump cover is supposed to be supported by timbers under the steel ring but has settled to the point that some
of the timbers can be removed by hand, meaning the sump cover and pad are floating and just being held by the
concrete pad. 
•  If we were to do minor repairs we would then be obligated by MA Department of Environmental Protection to upgrade
some of the service ports to containment spill buckets that are Enhanced Vapor Recovery approved. 
Please do not hesitate to contact me if any clarification is needed,

Vehicle and equipment per Public Work’s vehicle management and replacement
schedule. The procurement and upkeep of equipment is a significant factor in providing
cost-effective and reliable service for systems operation, maintenance, repair, 
rehabilitation and replacements. 
All vehicles and equipment are managed through the Fleet Department and included
within a replacement schedule according to specific criteria, such as age, mileage, and
major repairs needed for continued reliable service. Industry and Framingham DPW
experience indicates that above those thresholds maintenance increases substantially
to assure service reliability, as do major repairs, none of which provide a return on
investment, and they are not sustainable with the current DPW facility and staffing. In
addition to daily service for the various Divisions, nearly all vehicles and equipment are
used for the Department’s snow and ice management program which is particularly
destructive to vehicles.

deteriorates rapidly, costs more to raise back up to a State of Good Repair, and
increases the annual needs and costs for roadway maintenance, including emergency
and other corrective repairs.

City of Framingham FY23-27 Capital Improvement Program 
FY23 Recommended: 
Flagg Drive ADA Sidewalk and Curbing $572,000 General Fund
Public Works
Construct New ADA Compliant Concrete and Curb Ramps 
The proposed work will construct new ADA compliant concrete sidewalks and curb
ramps along Flagg Drive between Oaks Street and Warren Avenue. 
An assessment of the sidewalks on Flagg Drive was performed in May of 2021. It was
determined that several sections of the sidewalk were non-compliant. These funds will
be used in conjunction with the previously approved roadway improvements funding. 
The City has made significant investments in Flagg Drive with the new Fuller Middle
School. It makes good sense to complete all outstanding work in this location at this
time.

FY23 Recommended: 
Edgell Road/Central Street Intersection Improvements $432,000 General Fund
Public Works
Safety and Traffic Improvements for Intersection of Edgell Road and Central Street
The proposed work will construct safety and traffic improvements for the intersection of
Edgell Road and Central Street, including intersection geometric improvements, 
sidewalks, and installation of a traffic signal via State TIP funding. The funding will cover
the construction costs not covered by the TIP funding. 
The project will reduce traffic congestion and improve pedestrian mobility and safety by
providing an exclusive pedestrian phase in the traffic signal, as well as provide
crosswalks and ADA/AAB compliant sidewalks along both sides of both roadways. The
majority of the construction will be paid by the Federal and State funds, but some
specific items like underground City communication conduits are not eligible for the
State funding and must be paid by the City.

Re: FY-2023 Capital Improvements
Edgell Road at Central Street Intersection Improvement 
Dear Mr. Kiel,
VHB has prepared this letter to provide a description and cost estimate for the design and construction oversight efforts
required for the roadway improvements for the Edgell Road at Central Street intersection. 
In 2017, the City applied for state and federal funding under the State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP).  The
funding was approved, and the project has been programmed for the 2023 STIP year. On behalf of the City, VHB is
preparing to submit the 100% Design package to MassDOT at the beginning of September 2021. The project is scheduled
for advertisement by MassDOT in October 2022 and it is anticipated that construction will begin in April 2023 and be
completed by October 2024. 
The remaining design includes the preparation of the PS&E Design, Right -of -Way Plans and part-time construction phase
services. The total costs associated with the remaining design and part-time construction oversight and preparation of as-
built plans of the Edgell Road at Central Street Intersection Improvements is estimated to be $222,000.00. The cost does not
include temporary or permanent easement acquisition that will be required for the construction nor any legal fees or
overhead costs which are already funded by the City (FY-2022).  There are additional costs to the City which include DPW
oversight and non-participating construction costs which add to $209,905.00 to the Design costs bringing the total costs to
$432,000.00. 
If you have any questions, or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me. 
Sincerely, 
Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc.

Comments Heard at 25% Design Meeting
No need for traffic light
here 
Widen Central Street on
the north side from the
bridge to provide two
west bound traffic lanes. 
Eliminate the sidewalk
on the east side of
Edgell Road north of
Central. 
Eliminate the second
crosswalk north of
Central Street across
Edgell Road. 
Move the Central Street
crosswalks east of the
intersection so walkers
can cross on a shorter
crosswalk. 
Eliminate any dedicated
roadway for bikers 
Synchronize the traffic
light with the traffic
light at Route 9. 
Pleased City and
MassDOT working
together to address the
traffic issues
Thrilled to see plans for
bicycle lanes 
How will Vernon Street
be impacted 
Concern for emergency
vehicles and school
busses with increased
congestion/queues 
Enforce speeding and
remove trees to increase

Questions Received
Q: How would the signal timing likely affect the large line of cars/school buses trying to
get off Vernon onto Edgell during morning commute time (just S of this intersection)?
A: Vernon intersection is approximately 800’ south of the Central Street Intersection. The
Edgell Road weekday morning NB Through movement has a 50% queue of approximately
175’ and 95% queue of approximately 500’. It is not anticipated that this signal with have a
significant impact on the Vernon Street intersection, although it may provide more gaps at
that intersection.
Q: Is there a potential for two established lanes on Central Street?
A: VHB and the City are looking at all options to widen and stripe Central Street with two
dedicated turn lanes while still minimizing impacts to Environmentally sensitive areas as
well as private Sudbury Valley Trustees property.

RE: FY23 General Fund Request - 110 Western Avenue Roof Repairs
Project Description —This request is for repairs to the roof of the capital program office modular
building at 110 Western Avenue. 
Project Justifications —This roof is in need of repairs to extend its useful lives and restore it to a
weatherproof and water tight condition. 
The structure at 110 Western Avenue was originally established as a temporary office, but it has
held up well and continues to provide necessary space for key personnel and functions, including
Capital Projects, DPW Procurement, and DPW leadership. The one feature of the structure that is in
need of repairs is the roof, and making those repairs will enable the DPW to extend the life of the
structure for many more years. 
Project Budgets — A quote of $48,280 from a local contractor is attached to this memorandum. A
contingency of 10% brings the total to $53,108, say $53,100.

(NPDES) Phase II Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Permit
requirements. 
Partial recommendation for $100,000 of the $327,950 requested for Catchment
Investigations (MS4) Permit. 
This project will provide funds to assist with compliance with Year 5 of the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II Municipal Separate Storm
Sewer System (MS4) permit requirements. Specifically, this project will provide
consultant and contractor services for catchment investigations (i.e. inspections of the
drainage system to identify pollution sources and assess infrastructure).
The City of Framingham is required to operate its storm sewer system under a permit
from the US EPA. The permit requires the City to complete catchment investigations. 
In addition to water quality benefits, this work will help the City improve asset
management of drainage infrastructure. Non-compliance could result in administrative
orders or fines.

MA MS4 General Permit 
1.0. Introduction
This document consists of three (3) general permits listed in part 1.1. Each general permit is applicable to a
particular type of municipal system within Massachusetts. Many of the permit terms and conditions are
applicable across all regulated entities, and therefore are presented just once in parts 1-2, part 4, and
Appendices A through E. Other conditions are applicable to a particular set of authorized entities; these
terms and conditions are included in parts 3, and 5 and Appendices F through H. Throughout the permit, the
terms “this permit” or “the permit” will refer to the three general permits. 
1.1.  Areas of Coverage
This permit covers small municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s) located in the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts: 
•  Traditional Cities and Towns (NPDES Permit No. MAR041000)
•  State, federal, county and other publicly owned properties (Non-traditional) (MAR042000)
•  State transportation agencies (except for MassDOT- Highway Division) (MAR043000)
1.2.  Eligibility
The MS4 shall meet the eligibility provisions described in part 1.2.1 and part 1.9 to be eligible for
authorization under this permit. 
1.2.1. Small MS4s Covered
This permit authorizes the discharge of stormwater from small MS4s as defined at 40 CFR §
122.26(b) (16). This includes MS4s described in 40 CFR §122.32(a) (1) and (a) (2).  An MS4 is
eligible for coverage under this permit if it is: 
•  A small MS4 within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts;
•  Not a large or medium MS4 as defined in 40 CFR §§122.26(b)(4) or (7);
•  Located either fully or partially within an urbanized area as determined by the latest
Decennial Census by the Bureau of Census as of the effective date of this permit (the
2010 Census); or
•  Located in a geographic area designated by EPA as requiring a permit.
If the small MS4 is not located entirely within an urbanized area, only the portion of the MS4 that is
located within the urbanized area is regulated under 40 CFR §122.32(a) (1).
A small municipal separate storm sewer system means all separate storm sewers that are: 
•  Owned or operated by the United States, a state, city, town, borough, county, parish,
district, association, or other public body (created by or pursuant to state law) having
jurisdiction over disposal of sewage, industrial wastes, stormwater, or other wastes,
including special districts under state law such as a sewer district, flood control district
or drainage district, or similar entity, or an Indian tribe or an authorized Indian tribal
organization, or a designated and approved management agency under section 208 of
the CWA that discharges to waters of the United States.
•  Not defined as large or medium municipal separate storm sewer systems pursuant to 40
CFR § 122.26(b) (4) and (b) (7) or designated under 40 CFR § 122.26(a) (1) (v).
•  This term includes systems similar to separate storm sewer systems in municipalities
such as systems at military bases, large hospitals or prison complexes, and highways
207 
4
Page 208
MA MS4 General Permit 
and other thoroughfares. The term does not include separate storm sewers in very
discrete areas, such as individual buildings. 
1.3.  Limitations on Coverage
This permit does not authorize the following: 
a. Stormwater discharges mixed with sources of non-stormwater unless such non-stormwater
discharges are:
•  Authorized under a separate NPDES permit; or
•  A non-stormwater discharge as listed in part 1.4.
b. Stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity as defined in 40 CFR §122.26 (b) (14) (i)-
(ix) and (xi).
c. Stormwater discharges associated with construction activity as defined in 40 CFR §122.26(b) (14)
(x) or (b) (15).
d. Stormwater discharges currently authorized under another NPDES permit, including discharges
covered under other regionally issued general permits.
e. Stormwater discharges or discharge related activities that are likely to adversely affect any species
that are listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) or result in the
adverse modification or destruction of habitat that is designated as critical under the ESA. The
permittee shall follow the procedures detailed in Appendix C to make a determination regarding
eligibility. The permittee shall certify compliance with this provision on the submitted NOI.
f. Stormwater discharges whose direct or indirect impacts do not prevent or minimize adverse effects
on any Essential Fish Habitat.
g. Stormwater discharges, or implementation of a stormwater management program, which adversely
affects properties listed or eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The
permittee shall follow the procedures detailed in Appendix D to make a determination regarding
eligibility. The permittee shall certify compliance with this provision on the submitted NOI.
h. Stormwater discharges prohibited under 40 CFR § 122.4.
i. Stormwater discharges to the subsurface subject to state Underground Injection Control (UIC)
regulations. Although the permit includes provisions related to infiltration and groundwater
recharge, structural controls that dispose of stormwater into the ground may be subject to UIC
regulation requirements. Authorization for such discharges shall be obtained from Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection, Bureau of Resource Protection, Drinking Water Program,
Underground Injection Control, One Winter Street, Boston, MA 02108 – phone 617-292-5859.
j. Any non-traditional MS4 facility that is a “new discharger” as defined in part 5.1.4. and discharges
to a waterbody listed in category 5 or 4b on the Massachusetts Integrated Report of waters listed
pursuant to Clean Water Act section 303(d) and 305(b) due to nutrients (Total Nitrogen or (Total
Phosphorus), metals (Cadmium, Copper, Iron, Lead or Zinc), solids (TSS or Turbidity),

The following categories of non-stormwater discharges are allowed under this permit unless the
permittee, EPA, or the MassDEP identifies any category or individual discharge of non-stormwater
discharge in part 1.4.a-r as a significant contributor of pollutants to the MS4, then that category or
individual discharge is not allowed under part 1.4, but rather shall be deemed an “illicit discharge” 
under part 2.3.4.1, and the permittee shall address that category or individual discharge as part of the
Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination (IDDE) Program described in part 2.3.4 of this permit. 
a. Water line flushing
b. Landscape irrigation
c. Diverted stream flows
d. Rising ground water

where they are identified as significant sources of pollutants to waters of the United States. 
1.5.  Permit Compliance
Non-compliance with any of the requirements of this permit constitutes a violation of the permit and the
CWA and may be grounds for an enforcement action and may result in the imposition of injunctive
relief and/or penalties. 
1.6.  Continuation of this Permit
If this permit is not reissued prior to the expiration date, it will be administratively continued in
accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act and remain in force and effect for discharges that
were authorized prior to expiration. If a small MS4 was granted permit authorization prior to the
expiration date of this permit, it will automatically remain authorized by this permit until the earliest of: 
•  Authorization under a reissued general permit following timely and appropriate submittal
of a complete and accurate NOI requesting authorization to discharge under the reissued
permit; or
•  Issuance or denial of an individual permit for the MS4’s discharges; or

submission of an application for an individual or alternative NPDES permit. (See part 1.8) A
small MS4 will be authorized to discharge under the terms and conditions of this permit upon
receipt of notice of authorization from EPA.
c. Permittees whose authorization to discharge under the MS4-2003 permit, which expired on May
1, 2008, has been administratively continued in accordance with the Administrative Procedure
Act 5 U.S.C. § 558(c) and 40 CFR § 122.6, who wish to obtain coverage under this permit, must
submit a new NOI requesting permit coverage in accordance with the requirements of part 1.7 of
this permit to EPA within 90 days after the effective date of this permit. Permittees whose
authorization to discharge under the expired MS4-2003 permit was administratively continued,
who fail to submit a timely, complete and accurate NOI or an application for an individual
NPDES permit within 90 days after the effective date of this permit will be considered to be
discharging without a permit (see 40 CFR § 122.28(b)(3)(iii)).
1.8.  Individual Permits and Alternative General Permits
a. EPA may require a small MS4 to apply for and obtain authorization under either an individual
NPDES permit or an alternative NPDES general permit. Any interested person may petition EPA
in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR § 122.26(f) to require a small MS4 to apply for and/or
obtain authorization under either an individual NPDES permit or an alternative NPDES general
permit. If EPA requires a small MS4 to apply for an individual or alternative NPDES permit, EPA
will notify the small MS4 in writing that a permit application is required. This notification will
include a brief statement of the reasons for this decision and will provide application information
and an application deadline. If a small MS4 is authorized under the MS4-2003 permit or this permit
and fails to submit an individual NPDES or an alternative general permit NPDES permit
application as required by EPA, then the authorization under the MS4-2003 permit or this permit to
the small MS4 is automatically terminated at the end of the date specified by EPA as the deadline
211 
8
Page 212
MA MS4 General Permit 
for application submittal. EPA reserves the right to take enforcement action for any unpermitted
discharge. 
b. A small MS4 may request to be excluded from this general permit by applying for an individual permit or
authorization under an alternative general permit. In such a case, a small MS4 shall submit an individual
permit application in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR § 122.33(b) (2) (i) or § 122.33(b) (2)
(ii), with reasons supporting the request, to EPA at the address listed in part 1.7.3 of this permit. The
request may be granted by issuance of an individual permit or authorization under an alternative general
permit if EPA determines that the reasons stated by the small MS4 are adequate to support the request.
(See 40 CFR § 122.28(b) (3)).
c. When an individual NPDES permit is issued, or a small MS4 is authorized to discharge under an
alternative NPDES general permit, authorization under this permit automatically terminates on the
effective date of the individual permit or the date of authorization of coverage under the alternative
general permit.

2.0. Non-Numeric Effluent Limitations
This section includes terms and conditions necessary to reduce the discharge of pollutants from the MS4 to the
maximum extent practicable; to protect water quality and to satisfy the appropriate water quality requirements of
the Clean Water Act and the Massachusetts Water Quality Standards. 
2.1.  Water Quality Based Effluent Limitations
Pursuant to Clean Water Act 402(p)(3)(B)(iii), this permit includes provisions to ensure that discharges
from the permittee’s small MS4 meet applicable water quality standards as set forth in part 2.1.1. 
below. 
2.1.1. Requirement to Meet Water Quality Standards
a. The permittee’s discharges shall meet applicable water quality standards by complying with
parts 2.1.1.b and/or 2.1.1.c in accordance with the schedules set forth therein.[URL: "#Page217"] 2 Any other
2 Applicable water quality standards are the state standards that have been federally approved or promulgated as of the
issuance date of this permit and are compiled by EPA at [URL: "http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/standards/wqslibrary/"] http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/standards/wqslibrary/. 
217

MA MS4 General Permit 
discharge of a pollutant that: (i) is not addressed by part 2.1.1.b, part 2.1.1.c, part 2.2.1, and/or
part 2.2.2, (ii) is not the result of an illicit discharge subject to part 2.3.4, and (iii) does not meet
applicable water quality standards, either independently or in conjunction with other discharges, 
shall comply with part 2.1.1.d. 
b. If there is a discharge from the MS4 to a waterbody (or its tributaries in some cases) that is
subject to an EPA approved or established TMDL identified in part 2.2.1, the permittee is
subject to the requirements of part 2.2.1 and Appendix F of this permit and the permittee shall
comply with all applicable schedules, alternative schedules and requirements in Appendix F. A
permittee’s compliance with all applicable requirements and BMP implementation schedules in
Appendix F or any alternative schedules applicable to it will constitute compliance with part
2.1.1.a. of the Permit for discharges of pollutants addressed in Appendix F.
c. If (i)there is a discharge from the MS4 to a waterbody (or its tributaries in some cases) that is
water quality limited (see definition in Appendix A) due to nutrients (Total Nitrogen or Total
Phosphorus), metals (Cadmium, Copper, Iron, Lead or Zinc), solids (TSS or Turbidity),
bacteria/pathogens (E. Coli, Enterococcus or Fecal Coliform), chloride (Chloride) or oil and
grease (Petroleum Hydrocarbons or Oil and Grease) and is not subject to an approved TMDL, or
(ii)the MS4 is located within a municipality listed in part 2.2.2.a.-b., then the permittee is subject
to the requirements of part 2.2.2 and Appendix H of this permit and the permittee shall comply
with all applicable schedules and requirements in Appendix H. A permittee’s compliance with
all applicable requirements and BMP implementation schedules in Appendix H applicable to it
will constitute compliance with part 2.1.1.a. of the Permit for discharges of pollutants addressed
in Appendix H.
d. Pursuant to Part 2.1.1.a, upon notice from EPA or MassDEP to the permittee that a discharge of
a pollutant from the MS4 that is exceeding applicable water quality standards, the permittee
must, within 60 days, remedy the exceedance or eliminate the discharge. However, where such
remedy or elimination within 60 days is impracticable, the permittee shall submit to EPA, by the
same deadline, a schedule of actions to achieve a remedy or elimination in the shortest time not
impracticable. The permittee shall implement such actions on the schedule submitted to EPA and
report on progress in its annual reports unless or until EPA takes any other action that effectively
replaces the schedule..
2.1.2. Increased Discharges 
a. Any increased discharge, including increased pollutant loading(s) through the MS4 to waters of
the United States is subject to Massachusetts antidegradation regulations at 314 CMR 4.04. The
permittee shall comply with the provisions of 314 CMR 4.04 including information submittal
requirements and obtaining authorization for increased discharges where appropriate[URL: "#Page218"] 3.  Any
authorization of an increased discharge by MassDEP shall be incorporated into the permittee's
SWMP. If an applicable MassDEP approval specifies conditions or requirements related to the
increased discharge, such requirements may be independently enforceable under State law and
may be adopted into a future permit.
b. There shall be no increased discharges, including increased pollutant loading(s) from the MS4 to
impaired waters listed in categories 5 or 4b on the most recent Massachusetts Integrated Report
of waters listed pursuant to Clean Water Act section 303(d) and 305(b) unless the permittee
3 Contact MassDEP for guidance on compliance with 314 CMR 4.04 
218 
15
Page 219
MA MS4 General Permit 
demonstrates that there is no net increase in loading from the MS4 to the impaired water of the
pollutant(s) for which the waterbody is impaired. The permittee may demonstrate compliance
with this provision by either: 
i. Documenting that the pollutant(s) for which the waterbody is impaired is not present in
the MS4’s discharge and retaining documentation of this finding with the SWMP; or
ii. Documenting that the total load of the pollutant(s) of concern from the MS4 to any
impaired portion of the receiving water will not increase as a result of the activity and
retaining documentation of this finding in the SWMP. Unless otherwise determined by
the Permittee, USEPA or by MassDEP that additional demonstration is necessary,
compliance with the requirements of part 2.2.2 and part 2.3.6 of this Permit, including
all reporting and documentation requirements, shall be considered as demonstrating no
net increase as required by this part.
c. The requirements of this part are independent of permit conditions requiring reduction in
discharges of pollutants as set forth in parts 2.1.1 and 2.2 (water quality based requirements) and
2.3 (requirements to reduce discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent practicable).
Permittees remain subject to requirements to reduce the discharge of pollutants from the MS4 as
set forth in those parts.
2.2.  Discharges to Certain Impaired Waters
The permittee shall identify in the SWMP and Annual Reports all MS4 discharges, including both
outfalls and interconnections to other MS4s or other separate storm sewer systems, that: 
•  Are subject to Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) related requirements as identified in
part 2.2.1.
•  Are subject to additional requirements to protect water quality as identified in part 2.2.2.
The discharge location from an interconnection shall be determined based on the receiving water of the
outfall from the interconnected system. 
Permittees are subject to the applicable requirements in part 2.2.1, Appendix F, or an approved
alternative structural control implementation schedule, and/or the applicable requirements in part 2.2.2, 
and Appendix H. 
2.2.1. Discharges Subject to Requirements Related to an Approved TMDL
a. “Approved TMDLs” are those that have been approved by EPA as of the date of issuance of this
permit.
b. The MS4s specified below discharge to waters within Massachusetts that are subject to TMDLs,
or in some cases, to tributaries of such waters, and shall comply with the requirements of
Appendix F, part A. Appendix F identifies, by section, the provisions the permittee shall
implement to be consistent with the terms of the approved TMDL. Alternatively, EPA may
notify the permittee that an individual permit application is necessary in accordance with part
1.8.a.

remains ultimately responsible for permit compliance.
2.3.2. Public Education and Outreach 
Objective: The permittee shall implement an education program that includes educational goals
based on stormwater issues of significance within the MS4 area. The ultimate objective of a public
education program is to increase knowledge and change behavior of the public so that pollutants in
stormwater are reduced. 
a. The permittee shall continue to implement the public education program required by the MS4-
2003 permit by distributing educational material to the MS4 community. The educational
program shall define educational goals, express specific messages, define the targeted audience
for each message, and identify responsible parties for program implementation. If appropriate
for the target audience, materials may be developed in a language other than English. At a
minimum, the program shall provide information concerning the impact of stormwater
discharges on water bodies within the community, especially those waters that are impaired or
identified as priority waters. The program shall identify steps and/or activities that the public
can take to reduce the pollutants in stormwater runoff and their impacts to the environment.
b. The educational program shall include education and outreach efforts for the following four
audiences: (1) residents, (2) businesses, institutions (churches, hospitals), and commercial
facilities, (3) developers (construction), and (4) industrial facilities, unless one of these
audiences is not present in the MS4 community. In such a situation, the MS4 must document in
both the NOI and SWMP which audience is absent from the community and no educational
messages are required to that audience.
c. The permittee shall distribute a minimum of two (2) educational messages over the permit term
to each audience identified in part 2.3.2.b. The distribution of materials to each audience shall
be spaced at least a year apart. Educational messages may be printed materials such as
brochures or newsletters; electronic materials such as websites; mass media such as newspaper
articles or public service announcement (radio or cable); targeted workshops on stormwater
management, or displays in a public area such as town/city hall. The permittee may use existing
materials if they are appropriate for the message the permittee chooses to deliver or the permittee
may develop its own educational materials. The permittee may partner with other MS4s,
community groups or watershed associations to implement the education program to meet this
permit requirement.
Some EPA educational materials are available at: [URL: "http://cfpub.epa.gov/npstbx/index.html"] http://cfpub.epa.gov/npstbx/index.html.
d. The permittee shall, at a minimum, consider the topics listed in part 2.3.2.d.i. – iv when
developing the outreach/education program. The topics are not exclusive and the permittee shall
focus on those topics most relevant to the community.
i. Residential program: effects of outdoor activities such as lawn care (use of pesticides,
herbicides, and fertilizers and information on Massachusetts Regulation 331 CMR 31
pertaining to proper use of phosphorus containing fertilizers on turf grasses) on water 
28
231
Page 232
MA MS4 General Permit 
quality; benefits of appropriate on-site infiltration of stormwater; effects of automotive
work and car washing on water quality; proper disposal of swimming pool water; proper
management of pet waste; maintenance of septic systems. If the small MS4 area has
areas serviced by septic systems, the permittee shall consider information pertaining to
maintenance of septic systems as part of its education program. 
ii. Business/Commercial/Institution program: proper lawn maintenance (use of pesticides,
herbicides and fertilizer, and information on Massachusetts Regulation 331 CMR 31
pertaining to proper use of phosphorus containing fertilizers on turf grasses); benefits of
appropriate on-site infiltration of stormwater; building maintenance (use of detergents);
use of salt or other de-icing and anti-icing materials (minimize their use); proper storage
of salt or other de-icing/anti-icing materials (cover/prevent runoff to storm system and
contamination to ground water); proper storage of materials (emphasize pollution
prevention); proper management of waste materials and dumpsters (cover and pollution
prevention); proper management of parking lot surfaces (sweeping); proper car care
activities (washing of vehicles and maintenance); and proper disposal of swimming pool
water by entities such as motels, hotels, and health and country clubs (discharges must
be dechlorinated and otherwise free from pollutants).
iii. Developers and Construction: proper sediment and erosion control management
practices; information about Low Impact Development (LID) principles and
technologies; and information about EPA’s construction general permit (CGP).  This
education can also be a part of the Construction Site Stormwater Runoff Control
measure detailed in part 2.3.5.
iv. Industrial program: equipment inspection and maintenance; proper storage of industrial
materials (emphasize pollution prevention); proper management and disposal of wastes;
proper management of dumpsters; minimization of use of salt or other de-icing/anti-
icing materials; proper storage of salt or other de-icing/anti-icing materials
(cover/prevent runoff to storm system and ground water contamination); benefits of
appropriate on-site infiltration of stormwater runoff from areas with low exposure to
industrial materials such as roofs or employee parking; proper maintenance of parking
lot surfaces (sweeping); and requirements for coverage under EPA’s Multi-Sector
General Permit.
e. The program shall show evidence of focused messages for specific audiences as well as evidence
that progress toward the defined educational goals of the program has been achieved. The
permittee shall identify methods that it will use to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational
messages and the overall education program. Any methods used to evaluate the effectiveness of
the program shall be tied to the defined goals of the program and the overall objective of
changes in behavior and knowledge.
f. The permittee shall modify any ineffective messages or distribution techniques for an audience
prior to the next scheduled message delivery.
g. The permittee shall document in each annual report the messages for each audience; the method
of distribution; the measures/methods used to assess the effectiveness of the messages, and the
method/measures used to assess the overall effectiveness of the education program.

2.3.3. Public Involvement and Participation
Objective: The permittee shall provide opportunities to engage the public to participate in the
review and implementation of the permittee’s SWMP. 
a. All public involvement activities shall comply with state public notice requirements (MGL
Chapter 30A, Sections 18 – 25 – effective 7/10/2010). The SWMP, all documents submitted to
EPA in accordance with Appendix F, and all annual reports shall be available to the public
online if the permittee has a website on which to post these documents.
b. The permittee shall annually provide the public an opportunity to participate in the review and
implementation of the SWMP.
c. The permittee shall report on the activities undertaken to provide public participation
opportunities including compliance with part 2.3.3.a. Public participation opportunities pursuant
to part 2.3.3.b may include, but are not limited to, websites; hotlines; clean-up teams; monitoring
teams; or an advisory committee.
2.3.4  Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination (IDDE) Program
Objective: The permittee shall implement an IDDE program to systematically find and eliminate sources
of non-stormwater discharges to its municipal separate storm sewer system and implement procedures to
prevent such discharges. 
a. Legal Authority - The IDDE program shall include adequate legal authority to: prohibit illicit discharges;
investigate suspected illicit discharges; eliminate illicit discharges, including discharges from properties
not owned by or controlled by the MS4 that discharge into the MS4 system; and implement appropriate
enforcement procedures and actions. Adequate legal authority consists of a currently effective ordinance,
by-law, or other regulatory mechanism. For permittees authorized by the MS4-2003 permit, the ordinance,
by-law, or other regulatory mechanism was a requirement of the MS4-2003 permit and was required to be
effective by May 1, 2008. For new permittees the ordinance, by-law, or other regulatory mechanism shall
be in place within 3 years of the permit effective date.
b. During the development of the new components of the IDDE program required by this permit,
permittees authorized by the MS4-2003 permit must continue to implement their existing IDDE
program required by the MS4-2003 permit to detect and eliminate illicit discharges to their MS4.
2.3.4.1. Definitions and Prohibitions
The permittee shall prohibit illicit discharges and sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) to its MS4 and require
removal of such discharges consistent with parts 2.3.4.2 and 2.3.4.4 of this permit. 
An SSO is a discharge of untreated sanitary wastewater from a municipal sanitary sewer. 
An illicit discharge is any discharge to a municipal separate storm sewer that is not composed entirely of
stormwater, except discharges pursuant to a NPDES permit (other than the NPDES permit for discharges
from the municipal separate storm sewer) and discharges resulting from fire fighting activities. 
2.3.4.2. Elimination of Illicit Discharges
a. Upon detection of an illicit discharge, the permittee shall locate, identify and eliminate the illicit
discharge as expeditiously as possible. Upon identification of the illicit source the MS4 notify all
responsible parties for any such discharge and require immediate cessation of improper disposal 
30
233
Page 234
MA MS4 General Permit 
practices in accordance with its legal authorities. Where elimination of an illicit discharge within 60
days of its identification as an illicit discharge is not possible, the permittee shall establish an
expeditious schedule for its elimination and report the dates of identification and schedules for removal
in the permittee’s annual reports. The permittee shall immediately commence actions necessary for
elimination. The permittee shall diligently pursue elimination of all illicit discharges. In the interim, 
the permittee shall take all reasonable and prudent measures to minimize the discharge of pollutants to
and from its MS4. 
b. The period between identification and elimination of an illicit discharge is not a grace period.
Discharges from an MS4 that are mixed with an illicit discharge are not authorized by this Permit (part
1.3.a) and remain unlawful until eliminated.
2.3.4.3. Non-Stormwater Discharges
The permittee may presume that the sources of non-stormwater listed in part 1.4 of this permit need not be
addressed. However, if the permittee identifies any of these sources as significant contributors of
pollutants to the MS4, then the permittee shall implement measures to control these sources so they are no
longer significant contributors of pollutants, and/or eliminate them entirely, consistent with part 2.3.4. 
2.3.4.4. Sanitary Sewer Overflows
a. Upon detection of an SSO the permittee shall eliminate it as expeditiously as possible and take interim
mitigation measures to minimize the discharge of pollutants to and from its MS4 until elimination is
completed.
b. The permittee shall identify all known locations where SSOs have discharged to the MS4 within the
previous five (5) years. This shall include SSOs resulting, during dry or wet weather, from inadequate
conveyance capacities, or where interconnectivity of the storm and sanitary sewer infrastructure allows
for communication of flow between the systems. Within one (1) year of the effective date of the
permit, the permittee shall develop an inventory of all identified SSOs indicating the following
information, if available:
1. Location (approximate street crossing/address and receiving water, if any);
2. A clear statement of whether the discharge entered a surface water directly or entered the
MS4;
3. Date(s) and time(s) of each known SSO occurrence (i.e., beginning and end of any known
discharge);
4. Estimated volume(s) of the occurrence;
5. Description of the occurrence indicating known or suspected cause(s);
6. Mitigation and corrective measures completed with dates implemented; and
7. Mitigation and corrective measures planned with implementation schedules.
The permittee shall maintain the inventory as a part of the SWMP and update the inventory annually, 
all updates shall include the information in part 2.3.4.4.b.1-7. 
c. In accordance with Paragraph B.12 of Appendix B of this permit, upon becoming aware of an SSO to
the MS4, the permittee shall provide oral notice to EPA within 24 hours. Additionally, the permittee
shall provide written notice to EPA and MassDEP within five (5) days of becoming aware of the SSO
occurrence and shall include the information in the updated inventory. The notice shall contain all of
the information listed in part 2.3.4.4.b. Where common notification requirements for SSOs are 
31
234
Page 235
MA MS4 General Permit 
included in multiple NPDES permits issued to a permittee, a single notification may be made to EPA
as directed in the permittee’s wastewater or CSO NPDES permit and constitutes compliance with this
part. 
d. The permittee shall include and update the SSO inventory in its annual report, including the status of
mitigation and corrective measures implemented by the permittee to address each SSO identified
pursuant to this part.
e. The period between detection and elimination of a discharge from the SSO to the MS4 is not a grace
period. Discharges from an MS4 that are mixed with an SSO are not authorized by this Permit (part
1.3.a) and remain unlawful until eliminated.
2.3.4.5. System mapping
The permittee shall develop a revised and more detailed map than was required by the MS4-2003 permit. 
This revised map of the MS4 shall be completed in two phases as outlined below. The mapping shall
include a depiction of the permittee’s separate storm sewer system in the permit area. The mapping is
intended to facilitate the identification of key infrastructure and factors influencing proper system
operation, and the potential for illicit sanitary sewer discharges. 
a. Phase I: The system map shall be updated within two (2) years of the permit effective date to include
the following information:
•  Outfalls and receiving waters (required by MS4-2003 permit)
•  Open channel conveyances (swales, ditches, etc.)
•  Interconnections with other MS4s and other storm sewer systems
•  Municipally-owned stormwater treatment structures (e.g., detention and retention basins,
infiltration systems , bioretention areas, water quality swales, gross particle separators,
oil/water separators, or other proprietary systems)
•  Waterbodies identified by name and indication of all use impairments as identified on the most
recent EPA approved Massachusetts Integrated List of waters report pursuant to Clean Water
Act section 303(d) and 305(b)
•  Initial catchment delineations. Any available system data and topographic information may be
used to produce initial catchment delineations. For the purpose of this permit, a catchment is
the area that drains to an individual outfall or interconnection.
b. Phase II: The system map shall be updated annually as the following information becomes available
during implementation of catchment investigation procedures in part 2.3.4.8. This information must be
included in the map for all outfalls within ten (10) years of the permit effective date:
•  Outfall spatial location (latitude and longitude with a minimum accuracy of +/-30 feet)
•  Pipes
•  Manholes
•  Catch basins
•  Refined catchment delineations. Catchment delineations shall be updated to reflect
information collected during catchment investigations
•  Municipal sanitary sewer system (if available)
•  Municipal combined sewer system (if applicable). 
32
235
Page 236
MA MS4 General Permit 
c. Recommended elements to be included in the system map as information becomes available:
•  Storm sewer material, size (pipe diameter) and age
•  Sanitary sewer system material, size (pipe diameter) and age
•  Privately-owned stormwater treatment structures
•  Where a municipal sanitary sewer system exists, properties known or suspected to be served
by a septic system, especially in high-density urban areas
•  Area where the permittee’s MS4 has received or could receive flow from septic system
discharges (e.g., areas with poor soils, or high ground water elevations unsuitable for
conventional subsurface disposal systems)
•  Seasonal high water table elevations impacting sanitary alignments
•  Topography
•  Orthophotography
•  Alignments, dates and representation of work completed (with legend) of past illicit discharge
investigations (e.g., flow isolation, dye testing, CCTV)
•  Locations of suspected, confirmed and corrected illicit discharges (with dates and flow
estimates).
d. The mapping may be produced by hand or through computer-aided methods (e.g. GIS). The required
scale and detail of the map shall be appropriate to facilitate a rapid understanding of the system by the
permittee, EPA and the state. In addition, the mapping shall serve as a planning tool for the
implementation and phasing of the IDDE program and demonstration of the extent of complete and
planned investigations and corrections. The permittee shall update the mapping as necessary to reflect
newly discovered information and required corrections or modifications.
e. The permittee shall report on the progress towards the completion of the system map in each annual
report.
2.3.4.6. Written Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination Program
The IDDE program shall be recorded in a written (hardcopy or electronic) document. The IDDE program
shall include each of the elements described in parts 2.3.4.7 and part 2.3.4.8, unless the permittee provides
a written explanation within the IDDE program as to why a particular element is not applicable to the
permittee. 
Notwithstanding the permittee’s explanation, EPA may at any time determine that a particular element is in
fact applicable to the permittee and require the permittee to add it to the IDDE program. The written
(hardcopy or electronic) IDDE program shall be completed within one (1) year of the effective date of the
permit and updated in accordance with the milestones of this part. The permittee shall implement the IDDE
program in accordance with the goals and milestones contained in this part. 
a. The written (hardcopy or electronic) IDDE program shall include a reference or citation of the
authority the permittee will use to implement all aspects of the IDDE program.
b. Statement of IDDE Program Responsibilities - The permittee shall establish a written (hardcopy or
electronic) statement that clearly identifies responsibilities with regard to eliminating illicit discharges.
The statement shall identify the lead municipal agency(ies) or department(s) responsible for
implementing the IDDE Program as well as any other agencies or departments that may have
responsibilities for aspects of the program (e.g., board of health responsibilities for overseeing septic
system construction; sanitary sewer system staff; inspectional services for enforcing plumbing codes;

town counsel responsibilities in enforcement actions, etc.). Where multiple departments and agencies
have responsibilities with respect to the IDDE program specific areas of responsibility shall be defined
and processes for coordination and data sharing shall be established and documented. 
c. Program Procedures – The permittee shall include in the written IDDE program all written procedures
developed in accordance with the requirements and timelines in parts 2.3.4.7 and 2.3.4.8 below. At a
minimum this shall include the written procedures for dry weather outfall screening and sampling and
for catchment investigations.
2.3.4.7. Assessment and Priority Ranking of Outfalls/Interconnections
The permittee shall assess and priority rank the outfalls in terms of their potential to have illicit discharges
and SSOs and the related public health significance. This ranking will determine the priority order for
screening of outfalls and interconnections pursuant to part 2.3.4.7.b, catchment investigations for evidence
of illicit discharges and SSOs pursuant to part 2.3.4.8, and provides the basis for determining permit
milestones of this part. 
a) Outfall/Interconnection Inventory and Initial Ranking:
An initial outfall and interconnection inventory and priority ranking to assess illicit discharge potential
based on existing information shall be completed within one (1) year from the effective date of the
permit; an updated inventory and ranking will be provided in each annual report thereafter. The
inventory shall be updated annually to include data collected in connection with the dry weather
screening and other relevant inspections conducted by the permittee.
i.  The outfall and interconnection inventory will identify each outfall and interconnection
discharging from the MS4, record its location and condition, and provide a framework for tracking
inspections, screenings and other activities under the permittee’s IDDE program.
•  An outfall means a point source as defined by 40 CFR § 122.2 as the point where the
municipal separate storm sewer discharges to waters of the United States. An outfall does not
include open conveyances connecting two municipal separate storm sewers or pipes, tunnels or
other conveyances that connect segments of the same stream or other waters of the United
States and that are used to convey waters of the United States. (40 CFR § 122.26(b)(9)).
However, it is strongly recommended that a permittee inspect all accessible portions of the
system as part of this process. Culverts longer than a simple road crossing shall be included in
the inventory unless the permittee can confirm that they are free of any connections and simply
convey waters of the United States.
•  An interconnection means the point (excluding sheet flow over impervious surfaces) where the
permittee’s MS4 discharges to another MS4 or other storm sewer system, through which the
discharge is conveyed to waters of the United States or to another storm sewer system and
eventually to a water of the United States.
ii. The permittee shall classify each of the permittee’s outfalls and interconnections into one of the
following categories:
•  Problem Outfalls: Outfalls/interconnections with known or suspected contributions of illicit
discharges based on existing information shall be designated as Problem Outfalls. This shall
34
237
Page 238
MA MS4 General Permit 
include any outfalls/interconnections where previous screening indicates likely sewer input.[URL: "#Page238"] 4
Problem Outfalls need not be screened pursuant to part 2.3.4.7.b. 
•  High Priority Outfalls: Outfalls/interconnections that have not been classified as Problem
Outfalls and that are: 
o discharging to an area of concern to public health due to proximity of public beaches,
recreational areas, drinking water supplies or shellfish beds;
o determined by the permittee as high priority based on the characteristics listed below
or other available information;
•  Low Priority Outfalls: Outfalls/interconnections determined by the permittee as low priority
based on the characteristics listed below or other available information.
•  Excluded outfalls: Outfalls/interconnections with no potential for illicit discharges may be
excluded from the IDDE program. This category is limited to roadway drainage in
undeveloped areas with no dwellings and no sanitary sewers; drainage for athletic fields, parks
or undeveloped green space and associated parking without services; cross-country drainage
alignments (that neither cross nor are in proximity to sanitary sewer alignments) through
undeveloped land.
iii. The permittee shall priority rank outfalls into the categories above (except for excluded outfalls),
based on the following characteristics of the defined initial catchment area where information is
available:
•  Past discharge complaints and reports.
•  Poor receiving water quality- the following guidelines are recommended to identify waters as
having a high illicit discharge potential: exceeding water quality standards for bacteria;
ammonia levels above 0.5 mg/l; surfactants levels greater than or equal to 0.25 mg/l.
•  Density of generating sites- Generating sites are those places, including institutional,
municipal, commercial, or industrial sites, with a potential to generate pollutants that could
contribute to illicit discharges. Examples of these sites include, but are not limited to, car
dealers; car washes; gas stations; garden centers; and industrial manufacturing areas.
•  Age of development and infrastructure – Industrial areas greater than 40 years old and areas
where the sanitary sewer system is more than 40 years old will probably have a high illicit
discharge potential. Developments 20 years or younger will probably have a low illicit
discharge potential.
•  Sewer conversion – contributing catchment areas that were once serviced by septic systems,
but have been converted to sewer connections may have a high illicit discharge potential.
•  Historic combined sewer systems – contributing areas that were once serviced by a combined
sewer system, but have been separated may have a high illicit discharge potential.
•  Surrounding density of aging septic systems – Septic systems thirty years or older in
residential land use areas are prone to have failures and may have a high illicit discharge
potential.
•  Culverted streams – any river or stream that is culverted for distances greater than a simple
roadway crossing may have a high illicit discharge potential.
•  Water quality limited waterbodies that receive a discharge from the MS4 or waters with
approved TMDLs applicable to the permittee, where illicit discharges have the potential to
4 Likely sewer input indicators are any of the following: 
•  Olfactory or visual evidence of sewage,
•  Ammonia ≥ 0.5 mg/L, surfactants ≥ 0.25 mg/L, and bacteria levels greater than the water quality criteria applicable to
the receiving water, or
•  Ammonia ≥ 0.5 mg/L, surfactants ≥ 0.25 mg/L, and detectable levels of chlorine. 
35
238

MA MS4 General Permit 
contain the pollutant identified as the cause of the water quality impairment. 
•  The permittee may also consider additional relevant characteristics, including location-specific
characteristics; if so, the permittee shall include the additional characteristics in its written
(hardcopy or electronic) IDDE program.
b) Dry Weather Outfall and Interconnection Screening and Sampling
All outfalls/interconnections (excluding Problem and excluded Outfalls) shall be inspected for the
presence of dry weather flow within three (3) years of the permit effective date. The permittee shall
screen all High and Low Priority Outfalls in accordance with their initial ranking developed at part
2.3.4.7.a.
i.  Written procedure: The permittee shall develop an outfall and interconnection screening and
sampling procedure to be included in the IDDE program within one (1) year of the permit effective
date. This procedure shall include the following procedures for:
•  sample collection,
•  use of field kits,
•  storage and conveyance of samples (including relevant hold times), and
•  field data collection and storage.
An example screening and sampling protocol (EPA New England Bacterial Source Tracking
Protocol ) can be found on EPA’s website. 
ii. Weather conditions: Dry weather screening and sampling shall proceed only when no more than
0.1 inches of rainfall has occurred in the previous 24-hour period and no significant snow melt is
occurring.
iii. Screening requirements: For each outfall/interconnection:
1. The permittee shall record all of the following information and include it in the
outfall/interconnection inventory and priority ranking:
•  unique identifier,
•  receiving water,
•  date of most recent inspection,
•  dimensions,
•  shape,
•  material (concrete, PVC),
•  spatial location (latitude and longitude with a minimum accuracy of +/-30 feet,
•  physical condition,
•  indicators of potential non-stormwater discharges (including presence or evidence
of suspect flow and sensory observations such as odor, color, turbidity, floatables,
or oil sheen).
2. If an outfall/interconnection is inaccessible or submerged, the permittee shall proceed to
the first accessible upstream manhole or structure for the observation and sampling and
report the location with the screening results.
3. If no flow is observed, but evidence of illicit flow exists, the permittee shall revisit the 
36
239
Page 240
MA MS4 General Permit 
outfall during dry weather within one week of the initial observation, if practicable, to
perform a second dry weather screening and sample any observed flow (proceed as in iv. 
below).
4. Where dry weather flow is found at an outfall/interconnection, at least one (1) sample shall
be collected, and:
a) Samples shall be analyzed at a minimum for:
•  ammonia,
•  chlorine,
•  conductivity,
•  salinity,
•  E. coli (freshwater receiving water) or enterococcus (saline or brackish
receiving water),
•  surfactants (such as MBAS),
•  temperature, and
•  pollutants of concern[URL: "#Page240"] 5
b) All analyses with the exception of indicator bacteria and pollutants of concern can
be performed with field test kits or field instrumentation and are not subject to 40
CFR part 136 requirements. Sampling for bacteria and pollutants of concern shall
be conducted using the analytical methods found in 40 CFR §136, or alternative
methods approved by EPA in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR §136.
Sampling for ammonia and surfactants must use sufficiently sensitive methods to
detect those parameters at or below the threshold indicator concentrations of 0.5
mg/L for ammonia and 0.25 mg/L for surfactants. Sampling for residual chlorine
must use a method with a detection limit of 0.02 mg/L or 20 ug/L.
iv. The permittee may rely on screening conducted under the MS4-2003 permit, pursuant to an EPA
enforcement action, or by the state or EPA to the extent that it meets the requirements of part
2.3.4.7.b.iii.4. All data shall be reported in each annual report. Permittees that have conducted
substantially equivalent monitoring to that required by part 2.3.4.7.b as part of an EPA
enforcement action can request an exemption from the requirements of part 2.3.4.7.b by submitting
a written request to EPA and retaining exemption approval from EPA as part of the SWMP. Until
the permittee receives formal written approval of the exemption from part 2.3.4.7.b from EPA the
permittee remains subject to all requirements of part 2.3.4.7.b.
v.  The permittee shall submit all screening data used in compliance with this part in its Annual
Report.
c) Follow-up ranking of outfalls and interconnections:
i.  The permittee’s outfall and interconnection ranking (2.3.4.7.a) shall be updated to reprioritize
outfalls and interconnections based on information gathered during dry weather screening (part
2.3.4.7.b).
5 Where the discharge is directly into a water quality limited water or a water subject to an approved TMDL as indicated in
Appendix F; the sample shall be analyzed for the pollutant(s) of concern identified as the cause of the impairment as specified
in Appendix G 
37
240
Page 241
MA MS4 General Permit 
ii. Outfalls/interconnections where relevant information was found indicating sewer input to the MS4
or sampling results indicating sewer input[URL: "#Page241"] 6 shall be considered highly likely to contain illicit
discharges from sanitary sources, and such outfalls/interconnections shall be ranked at the top of
the High Priority Outfalls category for investigation. At this time, permittees may choose to rank
other outfalls and interconnections based on any new information from the dry weather screening.
iii. The ranking can be updated continuously as dry weather screening information becomes available,
but shall be completed within three (3) years of the effective date of the permit.
2.3.4.8. Catchment Investigations
The permittee shall develop a systematic procedure to investigate each catchment associated with an
outfall or interconnection within their MS4 system. 
a. Timelines:
•  A written catchment investigation procedure shall be developed within 18 months of the
permit effective date in accordance with the requirements of part 2.3.4.8.b below.
•  Investigations of catchments associated with Problem Outfalls shall begin no later than two (2)
years from the permit effective date.
•  Investigations of catchments associated with High and Low Priority Outfalls shall follow the
ranking of outfalls updated in part 2.3.4.7.c.
•  Investigations of catchments associated with Problem Outfalls shall be completed within seven
(7) years of the permit effective date
•  Investigations of catchments where any information gathered on the outfall/interconnection
identifies sewer input[URL: "#Page241"] 7 shall be completed within seven (7) years of the permit effective date.
•  Investigations of catchments associated with all High- and Low-Priority Outfalls shall be
completed within ten (10) years of the permit effective date.
*For the purposes of these milestones, an individual catchment investigation will be considered
complete if all relevant procedures in part 2.3.4.8.c. and 2.3.4.8.d. below have been completed.
b. A written catchment investigation procedure shall be developed that:
i.  Identifies maps, historic plans and records, and other sources of data, including but not
limited to plans related to the construction of the storm drain and of sanitary sewers, prior work
performed on the storm drains or sanitary sewers, board of health or other municipal data on septic
system failures or required upgrades, and complaint records related to SSOs, sanitary sewer
surcharges, and septic system breakouts. These data sources will be used in identifying system
6 Likely sewer input indicators are any of the following: 
•  Olfactory or visual evidence of sewage,
•  Ammonia ≥ 0.5 mg/L, surfactants ≥ 0.25 mg/L, and bacteria levels greater than the water quality criteria applicable to
the receiving water, or
•  Ammonia ≥ 0.5 mg/L, surfactants ≥ 0.25 mg/L, and detectable levels of chlorine.
7 Likely sewer input indicators are any of the following: 
•  Olfactory or visual evidence of sewage,
•  Ammonia ≥ 0.5 mg/L, surfactants ≥ 0.25 mg/L, and bacteria levels greater than the water quality criteria applicable to
the receiving water, or
•  Ammonia ≥ 0.5 mg/L, surfactants ≥ 0.25 mg/L, and detectable levels of chlorine. 
38

vulnerability factors within each catchment. 
ii. Includes a manhole inspection methodology that shall describe a storm drain network
investigation that involves systematically and progressively observing, sampling (as required
below) and evaluating key junction manholes (see definition in Appendix A) in the MS4 to
determine the approximate location of suspected illicit discharges or SSOs. The manhole
inspection methodology may either start from the outfall and work up the system or start from the
upper parts of the catchment and work down the system or be a combination of both practices.
Either method must, at a minimum, include an investigation of each key junction manhole within
the MS4, even where no evidence of an illicit discharge is observed at the outfall. The manhole
inspection methodology must describe the method the permittee will use. The manhole inspection
methodology shall include procedures for dry and wet weather investigations.
iii. Establishes procedures to isolate and confirm sources of illicit discharges where manhole
investigations or other physical evidence or screening has identified that MS4 alignments are
influenced by illicit discharges or SSOs. These shall include isolation of the drainage area for
implementation of more detailed investigations, inspection of additional manholes along the
alignment to refine the location of potential contaminant sources, and methods such as
sandbagging key junction manhole inlets, targeted internal plumbing inspections, dye testing,
video inspections, or smoke testing to isolate and confirm the sources.
c. Requirements for each catchment investigation associated with an outfall/interconnection:
i.  For each catchment being investigated, the permittee shall review relevant mapping and historic
plans and records gathered in accordance with Part 2.3.4.8.b.i. This review shall be used to identify
areas within the catchment with higher potential for illicit connections. The permittee shall identify
and record the presence of any of the following specific System Vulnerability Factors (SVFs):
•  History of SSOs, including, but not limited to, those resulting from wet weather, high water
table, or fat/oil/grease blockages;
•  Common or twin-invert manholes serving storm and sanitary sewer alignments;
•  Common trench construction serving both storm and sanitary sewer alignments;
•  Crossings of storm and sanitary sewer alignments where the sanitary system is shallower than
the storm drain system;
•  Sanitary sewer alignments known or suspected to have been constructed with an underdrain
system;
•  Inadequate sanitary sewer level of service (LOS) resulting in regular surcharging, customer
back-ups, or frequent customer complaints;
•  Areas formerly served by combined sewer systems;
•  Sanitary sewer infrastructure defects such as leaking service laterals, cracked, broken, or offset
sanitary infrastructure, directly piped connections between storm drain and sanitary sewer
infrastructure, or other vulnerability factors identified through Inflow/Infiltration Analyses,
Sanitary Sewer Evaluation Surveys, or other infrastructure investigations.
EPA recommends the permittee include the following in their consideration of System
Vulnerability Factors: 
•  Sewer pump/lift stations, siphons, or known sanitary sewer restrictions where
power/equipment failures or blockages could readily result in SSOs;
•  Any sanitary sewer and storm drain infrastructure greater than 40 years old; 
39
242
Page 243
MA MS4 General Permit 
•  Widespread code-required septic system upgrades required at property transfers
(indicative of inadequate soils, water table separation, or other physical constraints of the
area rather than poor owner maintenance);
•  History of multiple Board of Health actions addressing widespread septic system failures
(indicative of inadequate soils, water table separation, or other physical constraints of the
area rather than poor owner maintenance);
The permittee shall document the presence or absence of System Vulnerability Factors for each
catchment, retain this documentation as part of its IDDE program, and report this information in
Annual Reports. Catchments with a minimum of one (1) System Vulnerability Factor are subject
to wet weather sampling requirements of part 2.3.4.8.c.ii.2. 
ii. For each catchment, the permittee must inspect key junction manholes and gather catchment
information on the locations of MS4 pipes, manholes, and the extent of the contributing catchment.
1. For all catchments
a) Infrastructure information shall be incorporated into the permittee’s mapping required at
part 2.3.4.5; the permittee will refine their catchment delineation based on the field
investigation where appropriate.
b) The SVF inventory for the catchment will be updated based on information obtained
during the inspection, including common (twin invert) manholes, directly piped
connections between storm drains and sanitary sewer infrastructure, common weir walls,
sanitary sewer underdrain connections and other structural vulnerabilities where sanitary
discharges could enter the storm drain system during wet weather.
1) Where a minimum of one (1) SVF is identified based on previous information
or the investigation, a wet weather investigation must be conducted at the
associated outfall (see below).
c) During dry weather, key junction manholes[URL: "#Page243"] 8 shall be opened and inspected systematically
for visual and olfactory evidence of illicit connections (e.g., excrement, toilet paper, gray
filamentous bacterial growth, or sanitary products present).
1) If flow is observed, the permittee shall sample the flow at a minimum for
ammonia, chlorine and surfactants and can use field kits for these analyses.
2) Where sampling results or visual or olfactory evidence indicate potential illicit
discharges or SSOs, the area draining to the junction manhole shall be flagged for
further upstream investigation.
d) Key junction and subsequent manhole investigations will proceed until the location of
suspected illicit discharges or SSOs can be isolated to a pipe segment between two
manholes. If no evidence of an illicit discharge is found, catchment investigations will be
considered complete upon completion of key junction manhole sampling.
2. For all catchments with a minimum of one (1) SVF identified
a) The permittee shall meet the requirements above for dry weather screening
b) The permittee shall inspect and sample under wet weather conditions to the extent
necessary to determine whether wet weather-induced high flows in sanitary sewers or high
groundwater in areas served by septic systems result in discharges of sanitary flow to the
8 Where catchments do not contain junction manholes, the dry weather screening and sampling shall be considered as meeting
the manhole inspection requirement. In these catchments, dry weather screenings that indicate potential presence of illicit
discharges shall be further investigated pursuant to part 2.3.4.8.d. Investigations in these catchments may be considered
complete where dry weather screening reveals no flow; no evidence of illicit discharges or SSOs is indicated through sampling
results or visual or olfactory means; and no wet weather System Vulnerability Factors are identified. 
40
243

MA MS4 General Permit 
MS4. 
1) The permittee shall conduct at least one wet weather screening and sampling at the
outfall that includes the same parameters required during dry weather screening,
part 2.3.4.7.b.iii.4.
2) Wet weather sampling and screening shall proceed during or after a storm event of
sufficient depth or intensity to produce a stormwater discharge. EPA strongly
recommends sampling during the spring (March through June) when groundwater
levels are relatively high.
3) The permit does not require a minimum rainfall event prior to wet weather
screening. However, permittees may incorporate provisions that assist in targeting
such discharges, including avoiding sampling during the initial period of discharge
(“first flush”) and/or identifying minimum storm event intensities likely to trigger
sanitary sewer interconnections.
c) This sampling can be done upon completion of any dry weather investigation but must be
completed before the catchment investigation is marked as complete.
iii. All data collected as part of the dry and wet weather catchment investigations shall be recorded
and reported in each annual report.
d. Identification/Confirmation of illicit source
Where the source of an illicit discharge has been approximated between two manholes in the
permittee’s MS4, the permittee shall isolate and identify/confirm the source of the illicit discharge
using more detailed methods identified in their written procedure (2.3.4.8.b.iii). For outfalls that
contained evidence of an illicit discharge, catchment investigations will be considered complete upon
confirmation of all illicit sources.
e. Illicit discharge removal
When the specific source of an illicit discharge is identified, the permittee shall exercise its authority as
necessary to require its removal pursuant to part 2.3.4.2 or 2.3.4.3.
i.  For each confirmed source the permittee shall include in the annual report the following
information:
•  the location of the discharge and its source(s);
•  a description of the discharge;
•  the method of discovery;
•  date of discovery;
•  date of elimination, mitigation or enforcement action OR planned corrective measures and a
schedule for completing the illicit discharge removal; and
•  estimate of the volume of flow removed.
ii. Within one year of removal of all identified illicit discharges within a catchment area,
confirmatory outfall or interconnection screening shall be conducted. The confirmatory screening
shall be conducted in dry weather unless System Vulnerability Factors have been identified, in
which case both dry weather and wet weather confirmatory screening shall be conducted. If
confirmatory screening indicates evidence of additional illicit discharges, the catchment shall be
scheduled for additional investigation. 
41
244
Page 245
MA MS4 General Permit 
2.3.4.9. Indicators of IDDE Program Progress
The permittee shall define or describe indicators for tracking program success and evaluate and report on
the overall effectiveness of the IDDE program in each annual report. At a minimum the permittee shall
document in each annual report: 
•  the number of SSOs and illicit discharges identified and removed,
•  the number and percent of total outfall catchments served by the MS4 evaluated using the
catchment investigation procedure,
•  all dry weather and wet weather screening and sampling results and
•  the volume of sewage removed
2.3.4.10 Ongoing Screening
Upon completion of all catchment investigations pursuant to part 2.3.4.8.c and illicit discharge removal
and confirmation (if necessary) pursuant to paragraph 2.3.4.8.e, each outfall or interconnection shall be
reprioritized for screening in accordance with part 2.3.4.7.a and scheduled for ongoing screening once
every five years. Ongoing screening shall consist of dry weather screening and sampling consistent with
part 2.3.4.7.b; wet weather screening and sampling shall also be required at outfalls where wet weather
screening was required due to SVFs and shall be conducted in accordance with part 2.3.4.8.c.ii. All
sampling results shall be reported in the permittee’s annual report. 
2.3.4.11 Training
The permittee shall, at a minimum, annually provide training to employees involved in IDDE program
about the program, including how to recognize illicit discharges and SSOs. The permittee shall report on
the frequency and type of employee training in the annual report. 
2.3.5. Construction Site Stormwater Runoff Control
Objective: The objective of an effective construction stormwater runoff control program is to
minimize or eliminate erosion and maintain sediment on site so that it is not transported in
stormwater and allowed to discharge to a water of the U.S through the permittee’s MS4. The
construction site stormwater runoff control program required by this permit is a separate and
distinct program from EPA’s Construction General Permit in that the former is implemented by the
MS4 operator to ensure that runoff from construction sites discharging to the MS4 are controlled
consistent with the MS4’s applicable requirements, whereas the latter is implemented by
construction site operators to comply with the terms and conditions of EPA’s permit
(https://www.epa.gov/npdes/2017-construction-general-permit-cgp).
a. Permittees shall implement and enforce a program to reduce pollutants in any stormwater runoff
discharged to the MS4 from all construction activities that result in a land disturbance of greater
than or equal to one acre within the regulated area. The permittee’s program shall include
disturbances less than one acre if that disturbance is part of a larger common plan of
development or sale that would disturb one or more acres. Permittees authorized under the
MS4-2003 permit shall continue to implement and enforce their existing program and modify as
necessary to meet the requirements of this part.
b. The permittee does not need to apply its construction program requirements to projects that
receive a waiver from EPA under the provisions of 40 CFR § 122.26(b) (15) (i). 
42
245
Page 246
MA MS4 General Permit 
c. The permittee shall develop and implement a construction site runoff control program that
includes the elements in Paragraphs i. through iii. of this part:
i. An ordinance or regulatory mechanism that requires the use of sediment and erosion
control practices at construction sites. In addition to addressing sediment and erosion
control, the ordinance must include controls for other wastes on construction sites such
as demolition debris, litter and sanitary wastes. The ordinance or regulatory mechanisms
shall provide that the permittee may, to the extent authorized by law, impose sanctions
to ensure compliance with the local program. Development of an ordinance or other
regulatory mechanism was a requirement of the MS4-2003 permit (See part II.B.4 and
part IV.B.4).The ordinance or other regulatory mechanism required by the MS4-2003
permit shall have been effective by May 1, 2008.
ii. Written (hardcopy or electronic) procedures for site plan review, site inspections and
enforcement of sediment and erosion control measures by the permittee. If not already
existing, these procedures shall be completed within one (1) year from the effective date
of the permit.
1. The site plan review procedure shall include:
•  a pre-construction review by the permittee of the site design, the planned
operations at the construction site, planned BMPs during the construction
phase, and the planned BMPs to be used to manage runoff created after
development;
•  consideration of potential water quality impacts;
•  procedures for the receipt and consideration of information submitted by the
public; and
•  evaluating the incorporation of Low Impact Development (LID) site
planning and design strategies, unless such practices are infeasible.
2. The site inspection and enforcement procedures shall include:
•  who is responsible for site inspections and the necessary qualifications for
performing inspections, as well as who has authority to implement
enforcement procedures;
•  the requirement that inspections of BMPs occur during construction of
BMPs as well as after construction of BMPs to ensure they are working as
described in the approved plans
•  the use of mandated inspection forms, if appropriate; and
•  procedure for tracking the number of site reviews, inspections, and
enforcement actions. This tracking information shall be included as part of
each annual report required by part 4.4.
iii. Requirements for construction site operators performing land disturbance activities
within the MS4 jurisdiction that result in stormwater discharges to the MS4 to
implement a sediment and erosion control program that includes BMPs appropriate for
the conditions at the construction site. The program may include references to the
requirements of EPA’s Construction General Permit (including the development of a
SWPPP) to the extent they are consistent with the program requirements of this part.
The program may include references to BMP design standards in state manuals, such as
the 2008 Massachusetts Stormwater Handbook[URL: "#Page246"] 9, or design standards developed by the
9 The handbook is available at: https://www.mass.gov/guides/massachusetts-stormwater-handbook-and-stormwater-standards
43
246
Page 247
MA MS4 General Permit 
MS4. EPA supports and encourages the use of design standards in local programs. 
Examples of appropriate sediment and erosion control measures for construction sites
include local requirements to: 
1. Minimize the amount of disturbed area and protect natural resources;
2. Stabilize sites when projects are complete or operations have temporarily ceased;
3. Protect slopes on the construction site;
4. Protect all storm drain inlets and armor all newly constructed outlets;
5. Use perimeter controls at the site;
6. Stabilize construction site entrances and exits to prevent off-site tracking;
7. Control wastes that may be discharged, including but not limited to, discarded
building materials, concrete truck wash out, chemicals, litter, and sanitary wastes
(these wastes may not be discharged to the MS4); and
8. Inspect stormwater controls at consistent intervals.
2.3.6. Stormwater Management in New Development and Redevelopment (Post Construction
Stormwater Management) 
Objective: The objective of this control measure is to reduce the discharge of pollutants found in
stormwater through the retention or treatment of stormwater after construction on new or
redeveloped sites. For the purposes of this part (2.3.6.), the following definitions apply: 
site is defined as the area extent of construction activities, including but not limited to the
creation of new impervious cover and improvement of existing impervious cover (e.g. repaving
not covered by 2.3.6.a.ii.4.b.)
new development is defined as any construction activities or land alteration resulting in total
earth disturbances equal to or greater than 1 acre (or activities that are part of a larger common
plan of development disturbing greater than 1 acre) on an area that has not previously been
developed to include impervious cover. 
redevelopment is defined as any construction, land alteration, or improvement of impervious
surfaces resulting in total earth disturbances equal to or greater than 1 acre (or activities that are
part of a larger common plan of development disturbing greater than 1 acre) that does not meet
the definition of new development (see above).
a. Permittees shall develop, implement, and enforce a program to address post-construction
stormwater runoff from all new development and redevelopment sites that disturb one or more
acres and discharge into the permittees MS4 at a minimum. Permittees authorized under the
MS4-2003 permit shall continue to implement and enforce their program and modify as
necessary to meet the requirements of this part.
i. The permittee’s new development/ redevelopment program shall include sites less than
one acre if the site is part of a larger common plan of development or redevelopment
which disturbs one or more acre. 
44
247
Page 248
MA MS4 General Permit 
ii. The permittee shall develop or modify, as appropriate, an ordinance or other regulatory
mechanism within three (3) years of the effective date of the permit to contain
provisions that are at least as stringent as the following:
1. Low Impact Development (LID) site planning and design strategies must be
implemented unless infeasible in order to reduce the discharge of stormwater from

the stormwater associated with the completed site (post construction stormwater
management). The new development/redevelopment program shall have procedures to
ensure adequate long-term operation and maintenance of stormwater management
practices that are put in place after the completion of a construction project. These
procedures may include the use of dedicated funds or escrow accounts for development
projects or the acceptance of ownership by the permittee of all privately owned BMPs.
These procedures may also include the development of maintenance contracts between
the owner of the BMP and the permittee. Alternatively, these procedures may include
the submission of an annual certification documenting the work that has been done over
the last 12 months to properly operate and maintain the stormwater control measures.
The procedures to require submission of as-built drawings and ensure long term
operation and maintenance shall be a part of the SWMP. The permittee shall report in
the annual report on the measures that the permittee has utilized to meet this

Page 250
MA MS4 General Permit 
the creation of impervious cover. This assessment shall be used to provide information to allow
the permittee to determine if changes to design standards for streets and parking lots can be
made to support low impact design options. If the assessment indicates that changes can be
made, the assessment shall include recommendations and proposed schedules to incorporate
policies and standards into relevant documents and procedures to minimize impervious cover
attributable to parking areas and street designs. The permittee shall implement all
recommendations, in accordance with the schedules, contained in the assessment. The local
planning board and local transportation board should be involved in this assessment. This
assessment shall be part of the SWMP. The permittee shall report in each annual report on the
status of this assessment including any planned or completed changes to local regulations and
guidelines. 
c. Within four (4) years from the effective date of the permit, the permittee shall develop a report
assessing existing local regulations to determine the feasibility of making, at a minimum, the
following practices allowable when appropriate site conditions exist:
i. Green roofs;
ii. Infiltration practices such as rain gardens, curb extensions, planter gardens, porous and
pervious pavements, and other designs to manage stormwater using landscaping and
structured or augmented soils; and
iii. Water harvesting devices such as rain barrels and cisterns, and the use of stormwater for
non-potable uses.
The assessment should indicate if the practices are allowed in the MS4 jurisdiction and under what
circumstances are they allowed. If the practices are not allowed, the permittee shall determine what
hinders the use of these practices, what changes in local regulations may be made to make them
allowable, and provide a schedule for implementation of recommendations. The permittee shall
implement all recommendations, in accordance with the schedules, contained in the assessment. The
permittee shall report in each annual report on its findings and progress towards making the practices
allowable.(Information available at:

d. Four (4) years from the effective date of this permit, the permittee shall identify a minimum of 5
permittee-owned properties that could potentially be modified or retrofitted with BMPs designed
to reduce the frequency, volume, and pollutant loads of stormwater discharges to and from its
MS4 through the reduction of impervious area. Properties and infrastructure for consideration
shall include those with the potential for reduction of on-site impervious area (IA) as well as
those that could provide reduction of off-site IA. At a minimum, the permittee shall consider
municipal properties with significant impervious cover (including parking lots, buildings, and
maintenance yards) that could be modified or retrofitted. MS4 infrastructure to be considered
includes existing street right-of-ways, outfalls and conventional stormwater conveyances and
controls (including swales and detention practices) that could be readily modified or retrofitted
to provide reduction in frequency, volume or pollutant loads of such discharges through
reduction of impervious cover.
In determining the potential for modifying or retrofitting particular properties, the permittee shall
consider factors such as access for maintenance purposes; subsurface geology; depth to water
table; proximity to aquifers and subsurface infrastructure including sanitary sewers and septic
systems; and opportunities for public use and education. In determining its priority ranking, the
permittee shall consider factors such as schedules for planned capital improvements to storm and 
47
250

MA MS4 General Permit 
sanitary sewer infrastructure and paving projects; current storm sewer level of service; and
control of discharges to water quality limited waters, first or second order streams, public
swimming beaches, drinking water supply sources and shellfish growing areas. 
Beginning with the fifth year annual report and in each subsequent annual report, the permittee
shall identify additional permittee owned sites and infrastructure that could be retrofitted such
that the permittee maintains a minimum of 5 sites in their inventory, until such a time as when
the permittee has less than 5 sites remaining. In addition, the permittee shall report on all
properties that have been modified or retrofitted with BMPs to mitigate IA that were inventoried
in accordance with this part. The permittee may also include in its annual report non-MS4
owned property that has been modified or retrofitted with BMPs to mitigate IA. 
2.3.7. Good House Keeping and Pollution Prevention for Permittee Owned Operations

if not already developed, written (hardcopy or electronic) operations and maintenance
procedures for the municipal activities listed below in part 2.3.7.a.ii. These written
procedures shall be included as part of the SWMP.
ii. Within two (2) year of the effective date of this permit, the permittee shall develop an
inventory of all permittee owned facilities within the categories listed below. The
permittee shall review this inventory annually and update as necessary.
1. Parks and open space: Establish procedures to address the proper use, storage,
and disposal of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers including minimizing the
use of these products and using only in accordance manufacturer’s instruction.
Evaluate lawn maintenance and landscaping activities to ensure practices are
protective of water quality. Protective practices include reduced mowing
frequencies, proper disposal of lawn clippings, and use of alternative landscaping
materials (e.g., drought resistant planting).  Establish pet waste handling
collection and disposal locations at all parks and open space where pets are
permitted, including the placing of proper signage concerning the proper
collection and disposal of pet waste. Establish procedures to address waterfowl
congregation areas where appropriate to reduce waterfowl droppings from
entering the MS4. Establish procedures for management of trash containers at
parks and open space (scheduled cleanings; sufficient number). Establish
procedures to address erosion or poor vegetative cover when the permittee
becomes aware of it; especially if the erosion is within 50 feet of a surface water.
2. Buildings and facilities where pollutants are exposed to stormwater runoff: This
includes schools (to the extent they are permittee-owned or operated), town
offices, police, and fire stations, municipal pools and parking garages and other
permittee-owned or operated buildings or facilities. Evaluate the use, storage,
and disposal of petroleum products and other potential stormwater pollutants.
Provide employee training as necessary so that those responsible for handling
these products know proper procedures. Ensure that Spill Prevention Plans are 
48
251

MA MS4 General Permit 
in place, if applicable, and coordinate with the fire department as necessary. 
Develop management procedures for dumpsters and other waste management
equipment. Sweep parking lots and keep areas surrounding the facilities clean to
reduce runoff of pollutants. 
3. Vehicles and Equipment: Establish procedures for the storage of permittee
vehicles. Vehicles with fluid leaks shall be stored indoors or containment shall
be provided until repaired. Evaluate fueling areas owned or operated by the
permittee. If possible, place fueling areas under cover in order to minimize
exposure. Establish procedures to ensure that vehicle wash waters are not
discharged to the municipal storm sewer system or to surface waters. This
permit does not authorize such discharges.
iii. Infrastructure Operations and Maintenance
1. The permittee shall establish within two (2) year of the effective date of the
permit a written (hardcopy or electronic) program detailing the activities and
procedures the permittee will implement so that the MS4 infrastructure is
maintained in a timely manner to reduce the discharge of pollutants from the
MS4. If the permittee has an existing program to maintain its MS4 infrastructure
in a timely manner to reduce or eliminate the discharge of pollutants from the
MS4, the permittee shall document the program in the SWMP.
2. The permittee shall optimize routine inspections, cleaning and maintenance of
catch basins such that the following conditions are met:
•  Prioritize inspection and maintenance for catch basins located near
construction activities (roadway construction, residential, commercial, or
industrial development or redevelopment). Clean catch basins in such areas
more frequently if inspection and maintenance activities indicate excessive
sediment or debris loadings.
•  Establish a schedule with a goal that the frequency of routine cleaning will
ensure that no catch basin at anytime will be more than 50 percent full.
•  If a catch basin sump is more than 50 percent full during two consecutive
routine inspections/cleaning events, the permittee shall document that
finding, investigate the contributing drainage area for sources of excessive
sediment loading, and to the extent practicable, abate contributing sources.
The permittee shall describe any actions taken in its annual report.
•  For the purposes of this part, an excessive sediment or debris loading is a
catch basin sump more than 50 percent full. A catch basin sump is more
than 50 percent full if the contents within the sump exceed one half the
distance between the bottom interior of the catch basin to the invert of the
deepest outlet of the catch basin.
•  The permittee shall document in the SWMP and in the first annual report itsplan for optimizing catch basin cleaning, inspection plans, or its schedule
for gathering information to develop the optimization plan. Documentation
shall include metrics and other information used to reach the determination
that the established plan for cleaning and maintenance is optimal for the
MS4. The permittee shall keep a log of catch basins cleaned or inspected.

basins, number inspected, number cleaned, and the total volume or mass of
material removed from all catch basins.
3. The permittee shall establish and implement procedures for sweeping and/or
cleaning streets, and permittee-owned parking lots. All streets with the
exception of rural uncurbed roads with no catch basins or high speed limited
access highways shall be swept and/or cleaned a minimum of once per year in
the spring (following winter activities such as sanding).  The procedures shall
also include more frequent sweeping of targeted areas determined by the
permittee on the basis of pollutant load reduction potential, based on inspections,
pollutant loads, catch basin cleaning or inspection results, land use, water quality
limited or TMDL waters or other relevant factors as determined by the permittee.
The permittee shall report in each annual report the number of miles cleaned or
the volume or mass of material removed.
For rural uncurbed roadways with no catch basins and limited access highways,
the permittee shall either meet the minimum frequencies above, or develop and
implement an inspection, documentation and targeted sweeping plan within two
(2) years of the effective date of the permit, and submit such plan with its year
one annual report.
4. The permittee shall ensure proper storage of catch basin cleanings and street
sweepings prior to disposal or reuse such that they do not discharge to receiving
waters. These materials should be managed in compliance with current
MassDEP policies:
•  For catch basins cleanings:

5. The permittee shall establish and implement procedures for winter road
maintenance including the use and storage of salt and sand; minimize the use of
sodium chloride and other salts, and evaluate opportunities for use of alternative
materials; and ensure that snow disposal activities do not result in disposal of
snow into waters of the United States. For purposes of this MS4 Permit, salt
shall mean any chloride-containing material used to treat paved surfaces for
deicing, including sodium chloride, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, and
brine solutions.
6. The permittee shall establish and implement inspection and maintenance
frequencies and procedures for all stormwater treatment structures such as water
quality swales, retention/detention basins, infiltration structures, proprietary

v. The permittee shall keep a written (hardcopy or electronic) record of all required
activities including but not limited to maintenance activities, inspections and training
required by part 2.3.7.a. The permittee shall maintain, consistent with part 4.2.a, all
records associated with maintenance and inspection activities required by part 2.3.7.a.
b. Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP)
The permittee shall develop and fully implement a SWPPP for each of the following permittee-owned or
operated facilities: maintenance garages, public works yards, transfer stations, and other waste handling
facilities where pollutants are exposed to stormwater as determined by the permittee. If facilities are
located at the same property, the permittee may develop one SWPPP for the entire property. The SWPPP
is a separate and different document from the SWMP required in part 1.10. A SWPPP does not need to be
developed for a facility if the permittee has either developed a SWPPP or received a no exposure
certification for the discharge under the Multi-Sector General Permit or the discharge is authorized under
another NPDES permit. 
i. No later than two (2) years from the effective date of the permit, the permittee shall
develop and implement a written (hardcopy or electronic) SWPPP for the facilities
described above. The SWPPP shall be signed in accordance with the signatory
requirements of Appendix B – Subparagraph 11.
ii. The SWPPP shall contain the following elements:
1. Pollution Prevention Team
Identify the staff on the team, by name and title. If the position is unstaffed, the
title of the position should be included and the SWPPP updated when the
position is filled. The role of the team is to develop, implement, maintain, and
revise, as necessary, the SWPPP for the facility.
2. Description of the facility and identification of potential pollutant sources
The SWPPP shall include a map of the facility and a description of the activities
that occur at the facility. The map shall show the location of the stormwater
outfalls, receiving waters, and any structural controls. Identify all activities that
occur at the facility and the potential pollutants associated with each activity
including the location of any floor drains. These may be included as part of the
inventory required by part 2.3.7.a.
3. Identification of stormwater controls
The permittee shall select, design, install, and implement the control measures
detailed in paragraph 4 below to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants
from the permittee owned facility.
The selection, design, installation, and implementation of the control measures
shall be in accordance with good engineering practices and manufacturer’s
specifications. The permittee shall also take all reasonable steps to control or 
51
254
Page 255
MA MS4 General Permit 
address the quality of discharges from the site that may not originate at the
facility. 
If the discharge from the facility is to a water quality limited water and the
facility has the potential to discharge the pollutant identified as causing the water
quality limitation, the permittee shall identify the control measures that will be
used to address this pollutant at the facility so that the discharge meets applicable
water quality standards. 
4. The SWPPP shall include the following management practices:
a) Minimize or Prevent Exposure: The permittee shall to the extent
practicable either locate materials and activities inside, or protect them
with storm-resistant coverings in order to prevent exposure to rain,
snow, snowmelt and runoff (although significant enlargement of
impervious surface area is not recommended). Materials do not need to
be enclosed or covered if stormwater runoff from affected areas will not
be discharged directly or indirectly to surface waters or to the MS4 or if
discharges are authorized under another NPDES permit.
b) Good Housekeeping: The permittee shall keep clean all exposed areas
that are potential sources of pollutants, using such measures as sweeping
at regular intervals. Ensure that trash containers are closed when not in
use, keep storage areas well swept and free from leaking or damaged
containers; and store leaking vehicles needing repair indoors.
c) Preventative Maintenance: The permittee shall regularly inspect, test,
maintain, and repair all equipment and systems to avoid situations that
may result in leaks, spills, and other releases of pollutants in stormwater
to receiving waters. Inspections shall occur at a minimum once per
quarter.
d) Spill Prevention and Response: The permittee shall minimize the
potential for leaks, spills, and other releases that may be exposed to
stormwater and develop plans for effective response to such spills if or
when they occur. At a minimum, the permittee shall have procedures
that include:
•  Preventive measures such as barriers between material storage
and traffic areas, secondary containment provisions, and
procedures for material storage and handling.
•  Response procedures that include notification of appropriate
facility personnel, emergency agencies, and regulatory agencies,
and procedures for stopping, containing, and cleaning up leaks,
spills and other releases. Measures for cleaning up hazardous
material spills or leaks shall be consistent with applicable
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations
at 40 CFR section 264 and 40 CFR section 265. Employees 
52
255
Page 256
MA MS4 General Permit 
who may cause, detect, or respond to a spill or leak shall be
trained in these procedures and have necessary spill response
equipment available. If possible, one of these individuals should
be a member of the Pollution Prevention Team; and
•  Contact information for individuals and agencies that shall be
notified in the event of a leak, spill, or other release. Where a
leak, spill, or other release containing a hazardous substance or
oil in an amount equal to or in excess of a reportable quantity
established under 40 CFR section 110, 40 CFR section 117, or
40 CFR section 302, occurs during a 24-hour period, the
permittee shall notify the National Response Center (NRC) at
(800) 424-8802 in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR
section 110, 40 CFR section 117, and 40 CFR section 302 as
soon as the permittee has knowledge of the discharge. State or
local requirements may necessitate reporting spills or discharges
to local emergency, public health or drinking water supply
agencies, and owners of public drinking water supplies. Contact
information shall be in locations that are readily accessible and
available.
e) Erosion and Sediment Control: The permittee shall use structural and
non-structural control measures at the facility to stabilize and contain
runoff from exposed areas and to minimize or eliminate onsite erosion
and sedimentation. Efforts to achieve this may include the use of flow
velocity dissipation devices at discharge locations and within outfall
channels where necessary to reduce erosion.
f) Management of Runoff: The permittee shall manage stormwater runoff
from the facility to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants. This
may include management practices which divert runoff from areas that
are potential sources of pollutants, contain runoff in such areas, or reuse,
infiltrate or treat stormwater to reduce the discharge of pollutants.
g) Salt Storage Piles or Piles Containing Salt: For storage piles of salt or
piles containing salt used for deicing or other purposes (including
maintenance of paved surfaces) for which the discharge during
precipitation events discharges to the permittee’s MS4, any other storm
sewer system, or to a Water of the US, the permittee shall prevent
exposure of the storage pile to precipitation by enclosing or covering the
storage piles. Such piles shall be enclosed or covered within two (2)
years of the permit effective date. The permittee shall implement
appropriate measures (e.g., good housekeeping, diversions, containment)
to minimize exposure resulting from adding to or removing materials
from the pile. The permittee is encouraged to store piles in such a
manner as not to impact surface water resources, ground water
resources, recharge areas, and wells.
h) Employee Training: The permittee shall regularly train employees who
work in areas where materials or activities are exposed to stormwater, or
who are responsible for implementing activities identified in the SWPPP 
53
256
Page 257
MA MS4 General Permit 
(e.g., inspectors, maintenance personnel), including all members of the
Pollution Prevention Team. Training shall cover both the specific
components and scope of the SWPPP and the control measures required
under this part, including spill response, good housekeeping, material
management practices, any best management practice operation and
maintenance, etc. EPA recommends annual training. 
The permittee shall document the following information for each training: 
•  The training date, title and training duration;
•  List of municipal attendees;
•  Subjects covered during training
i) Maintenance of Control Measures: The permittee shall maintain all
control measures, required by this permit in effective operating
condition. The permittee shall keep documentation onsite that describes
procedures and a regular schedule for preventative maintenance of all
control measures and discussions of back-up practices in place should a
runoff event occur while a control measure is off-line. Nonstructural
control measures shall also be diligently maintained (e.g., spill response
supplies available, personnel trained).
iii. The permittee shall conduct the following inspections:
1. Site Inspections: Inspect all areas that are exposed to stormwater and all
stormwater control measures. Inspections shall be conducted at least once each
calendar quarter. More frequent inspections may be required if significant
activities are exposed to stormwater. Inspections shall be performed when the
facility is in operation. At least one of the quarterly inspections shall occur
during a period when a stormwater discharge is occurring.
The permittee shall document the following information for each facility inspection: 
•  The inspection date and time;
•  The name of the inspector;
•  Weather information and a description of any discharge
occurring at the time of the inspection;
•  Identification of any previously unidentified discharges from the
site;
•  Any control measures needing maintenance or repair;
•  Any failed control measures that need replacement.
•  Any SWPPP changes required as a result of the inspection.
If during the inspections, or any other time, the permittee identifies control
measures that need repair or are not operating effectively, the permittee shall
repair or replace them before the next anticipated storm event if possible, or as
soon as practicable following that storm event. In the interim, the permittee shall
have back-up measures in place.

5.0. Non-Traditional MS4s
Non-traditional MS4s are MS4s owned and operated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, counties or
other public agencies within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and properties owned and operated by
the United States (Federal Facilities) within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This part addresses all
non-traditional MS4s except MS4s that are owned or operated by transportation agencies, which are
addressed in part 6.0 below. 
5.1.  Requirements for Non-Traditional MS4s
All requirements and conditions of parts 1 – 4 above apply to all Non-traditional MS4s, except as
specifically provided below: 
5.1.1. Public education
For the purpose of this permit, the audiences for a Non-traditional MS4 include the employees, 
clients and customers (including students at education MS4s), visitors to the property, tenants, long
term contractors and any other contractors working at the facility where the MS4 is located. The
permittee may use some of the educational topics included in part 2.3.2.d. as appropriate, or may
focus on topics specific to the MS4. The permittee shall document the educational topics for each
target audience in the SWMP and annual reports.

MA MS4 General Permit 
5.1.2. Ordinances and regulatory mechanisms 
Some Non-traditional MS4s may not have authority to enact an ordinance, by-law, or other
regulatory mechanisms. MS4s without the authority to enact an ordinance shall ensure that written
policies or procedures are in place to address the requirements of part 2.3.4.5., part 2.3.4.6 and part
2.3.6.a. 
5.1.3. Assessment of Regulations
Non-traditional MS4s do not need to meet the requirements of part 2.3.6.c. 
5.1.4. New Dischargers
New MS4 facilities are subject to additional water quality-based requirements if they fall within the
definition of “new discharger” under 40 CFR § 122.2: “A new discharger is any building, structure, 
facility or installation (a) from which there is or may be a ‘discharge of pollutants’ (b) that did not
commence the ‘discharge of pollutants’ at a particular ‘site’ prior to August 13, 1979; (c) which is
not a ‘new source’; and (d) which never received a finally effective NPDES permit for discharges at
that ‘site.’ The term "site" is defined in § 122.2 to mean "the land or water area where any 'facility
or activity' is physically located or conducted including adjacent land used in connection with the
facility or activity."
Consistent with these definitions, a Non-traditional MS4 is a “new discharger” if it discharges
stormwater from a new facility with an entirely new separate storm sewer system that is not
physically located on the same or adjacent land as an existing facility and associated system
operated by the same MS4. 
Any Non-traditional MS4 facility that is a “new discharger” and discharges to a waterbody listed in
category 5 or 4b on the Massachusetts Integrated Report of waters listed pursuant to Clean Water
Act section 303(d) and 305(b) due to nutrients (Total Nitrogen or Total Phosphorus), metals
(Cadmium, Copper, Iron, Lead or Zinc), solids (TSS or Turbidity), bacteria/pathogens (E. Coli, 
Enteroccus or Fecal Coliform), chloride (Chloride) or oil and grease (Petroleum Hydrocarbons or
Oil and Grease), or discharges to a waterbody with an approved TMDL for any of those pollutants, 
is not eligible for coverage under this permit and shall apply for an individual permit. 
Any Non-traditional MS4 facility that is a “new discharger” and discharges to a waterbody that is in
attainment is subject to Massachusetts antidegradation regulations at 314 CMR 4.04. The permittee
shall comply with the provisions of 314 CMR 4.04 including information submittal requirements
and obtaining authorization for new discharges where appropriate[URL: "#Page262"] 12.  Any authorization of new
discharges by MassDEP shall be incorporated into the permittee's SWMP. If an applicable
MassDEP approval specifies additional conditions or requirements, then those requirements are
incorporated into this permit by reference. The permittee must comply with all such requirements. 
5.1.5  Dischargers Subject to Appendix F Part A.I
Those dischargers not identified in Appendix F Table F-2 or Table F-3 discharging to waterbodies
in the Charles River Watershed or to an MS4 that discharges to a waterbody in the Charles River
Watershed shall coordinate with the municipality in which they are located to facilitate compliance

6.0 Requirements for MS4s Owned or Operated by Transportation Agencies
This part applies to all MS4s owned or operated by any state or federal transportation agency (except
Massachusetts Department of Transportation –MassDOT- Highway Division, which is subject to a separate
individual permit). All requirements and conditions of this permit apply with the following exceptions: 
6.1  Public education 
For the purpose of this permit, the audiences for a transportation agency education program include the general
public (users of the roadways), employees, and any contractors working at the location. The permittee may use
some of the educational topics included in part 2.3.2.d. as appropriate, or may focus on topics specific to the
agency. The permittee shall document the educational topics for each target audience. 
6.2  Ordinances and regulatory mechanisms 
The transportation agency may not have authority to enact an ordinance, by-law or other regulatory
mechanisms. The agency shall ensure that written agency policies or procedures are in place to address the
requirements of part 2.3.4.5., part 2.3.4.6 and part 2.3.6.a. 
6.3  Assessment of regulations 
Non-traditional MS4s do not need to meet the requirements of part 2.3.6.c. 
6.4  New Dischargers
New MS4 facilities are subject to additional water quality-based requirements if they fall within the definition
of “new dischargers” under 40 CFR § 122.2: “A new discharger is any building, structure, facility or
installation (a) from which there is or may be a ‘discharge of pollutants’ (b) that did not commence the
‘discharge of pollutants’ at a particular ‘site’ prior to August 13, 1979; (c) which is not a ‘new source’; and (d) 
which never received a finally effective NPDES permit for discharges at that ‘site.’ The term "site" is defined
in § 122.2 to mean "the land or water area where any 'facility or activity' is physically located or conducted

Construction Phase for full replacement of Farley Building roof. 
The design phase for the Farley Roof has been approved by the City Council as of
October 2021. This request is for the construction phase. 
This project is for the full replacement of the roof and corresponding components at the
Farley Building. The current roof is failing and in need of full replacement to ensure
continued operations and avoidance of catastrophic failure.

Off-Cycle Farley Roof Replacement Capital Proposal
Fiscal Year 2022
The Framingham School Department respectfully requests mid-year FY2022 capital budget
funding for the Farley Building Roof Replacement project. In anticipation of the District receiving
management, oversight, and capital investment responsibilities from MassBay, the School
Department requested a capital appropriation from the City in our FY19, FY20, and FY22
proposals to address facilities maintenance issues. During FY19 and FY20, the requests were
focused on facility renovations, and mechanical system upgrades and replacements in
anticipation of relocating all Central Office staff, The Parent information Center and various
school programs, and community initiatives to Farley. In FY22, we requested funding to replace
the failing roof to ensure continued safe operations while protecting the interior infrastructure.
Unfortunately that request was deferred, allowing for the continued deterioration of the roof
system.
The current roofing system is in poor condition. In October of 2020, a routine, full study and roof
scan was performed by Gale Associates. This study found multiple deficiencies all pointing to a
full system replacement. Deficiencies identified included portions of the roof systems holding
water, allowing moisture infiltration and reported leaks throughout the building; moisture damage
at multiple test pit locations; lack of effective slope to direct moisture to the drains resulting in
ponding water; deteriorated roofing lap seams between reinforcing plys; and the presence of
water collecting within the open flutes of the metal deck furthering damage and water infiltration.
The School Department’s roof contractor, Tremco, has performed numerous assessments and
repairs due to continued leaks and infiltration damage. Additionally, the warranties for Farley
expired in 2017 & 2018, leaving the City open to potential liabilities with the failing system and
responsible for any needed repairs.
Staff have researched alternative funding sources such as the accelerated roof repair program
offered by the MSBA. Unfortunately due to the current and future planned usage of Farley, it
does not meet the requirements of remaining a public K-12 school facility, serving public school
students, for the duration of the useful life of roof repair. This has limited our ability to submit a
statement of interest for the accelerated roof repair program, similar to how we have
approached projects at McCarthy and Dunning Elementary School’s. The current project cost is
$3,108,400, which has greatly increased over the FY22 request of $1,826,975. A number of
factors have impacted costs, leading to a large project increase. Those factors include inflation;
increase in materials and labor; inclusion of a structural analysis for future solar placement;
repairs to the copper roofs which were not included or needed in the prior year proposal; and
increase in cost per s.f. over the past fiscal year (FY22- $30/s.f.; current pricing is $38/s.f.). It is
our expectation that if this project continues to be deferred, the cost will continue to increase,
placing a large financial burden on the City.
The Farley Building plays a vital role in the District’s future vision. Starting in the summer of
2021, all central office Departments have begun relocating to the Farley Building. This includes,
269
Page 270
but is not limited to Adult ESL; Welcome Center; Business Operations; Superintendent’s Office;
Equity, Diversity and Community Development; Buildings & Grounds; Human Resources;
Community Resource Development; School Committee; and many other District Departments.
MassBay plans on vacating the 80,000 s.f. they currently occupy by 2023. If catastrophic failure
occurred to the roof and we were forced to vacate the building, the cost to the district to rent a
similar sized footprint (22,000 s.f.) to support operations of these Departments and programs
would cost between $440,000 to $704,000 annually to rent appropriate space. The School
Department will continue to develop plans once we determine the future use of the Farley
building in the areas currently occupied by Mass Bay. It is imperative for the City to replace the
Farley roof as soon as possible as construction costs continue to escalate and the roof
continues to deteriorate.

Executive Summary
In accordance with our contract, Gale Associates, Inc. (Gale) has prepared a roof condition survey
for the Framingham Public Schools (FPS).  This submission relates specifically to the existing
condition of the low-sloped roof areas at the Farley Middle School (FMS) located at 19 Flagg Street, 
Framingham, MA. This report includes descriptions of the existing conditions, photo
documentation, and provides roof remediation options. 
The existing roofing systems at Farley Middle School reviewed consist of multi-ply built-up roofing
assemblies installed over polyisocyanurate rigid insulation. The roof deck at the FMS was observed
to consist of sloped metal decking. Based on our observations, portions of the roof systems are
wet and allowing moisture infiltration and reported leaks. The system appears to be approaching
the end of their useful service life. 
An infrared roof scan was performed to identify areas of potential moisture damage. Based on the
extent of moisture, a potential full system replacement should be considered at the Farley Middle
School. Additional deficiencies observed include lack of effective slope to direct moisture to the
drains resulting in ponding water, deteriorated roofing lap seams between reinforcing plys, and the
presence of water collecting within the open flutes of the metal deck. 
•  Roof Areas A, G, H, I, J, L appear to exhibit the most widespread signs of moisture within the
roofing system with the potential to cause deterioration to the roofing structural deck and it is
Gale’s opinion that these roof areas should be considered for immediate removal and
replacement. 
•  Roof Area D consists of an EPDM roof system that was installed in 2016 and is currently covered
under a 20-year warranty and was not reviewed as part of this evaluation. 
Please note that the estimated cost noted below does not include any special permitting fees which
may or may not be required for this project, additional engineering fees, Framingham’s monitoring
of the project, interior renovations beyond those that are described within this report, a
construction trailer/office space, or soft costs associated with working with Framingham Public
Schools. Again, these recommended budgets are preliminary, and should not be used for sensitive
budgeting, as the final scope of work, and detailing has not been confirmed at this time. 
Estimated Remediation Cost:

Background
The Farley Middle School reportedly constructed in 1973 and renovated in 2003 is currently leased
to the Massachusetts Bay Community College. The approximate 52,000 sq.ft., two-story building is
constructed with a concrete masonry unit (CMU) backup wall and the masonry veneer. Irregular
shaped aluminum windows, areas of wood siding, and hollow metal doors are located within the
exterior walls. The roofing consists of isolated areas of sloped metal panels, translucent skylights
with single pane glazing and a gravel surface built-up roofing assembly. 
The existing roofing systems at the FMS include low sloped and limited areas of steep sloped roofs. 
The steep sloped roofs consist of standing seam copper panel roofs installed over structural metal
decking located over stair towers and entrances. The low sloped roof systems consist of gravel
surface built-up roofing assemblies incorporating 4 plys of reinforced fabric that are set in a fluid
applied asphaltic based adhesive over a ½” fiber board coverboard and varying thickness of flat
stock polyisocyanurate insulation. The roofing system is installed on a sloped structural metal
decking. Several large Roof Top Units (RTU)s, Air Handler Units (AHU)s, and smaller air conditioners
and vents are located within the roof areas.

Visual Evaluation
As part of the evaluation, Gale conducted a visual evaluation of the FMS’s roof areas to observe the
extent and location of defects as well as locate areas of potential moisture infiltration using non-
destructive capacitance metering and infrared thermography. 
Figure 2: Farley Middle School Roof Area Plan with Infrared Images Overlayed 
Low Sloped Roofs, Roof Areas A through M
Gale’s general observations include but are not limited to the following: 
1.  The existing roof drains generally consist of no-hub cast iron assemblies that appear to be in
good condition however, they exhibit surface rust in the bowls and on drain hardware. Cast
iron strainers are generally in good condition but are dislodged from the clamping rings at
some locations. 
3 
284
Page 285
2.  Numerous previously performed repairs were evident based on the quantity of stripped-in
membrane seams and roof patches that were observed in the field of the roof and at roof-
to-wall flashings. The repairs appear to be in fair condition, but the presence of the stone
ballast created difficulties in confirming the extent of the repairs and condition of the patch
perimeters which are typically more susceptible to failure and allowing moisture infiltration. 
3.  A large ribbon of slope skylight assemblies is present between Roof Areas G/J and H/I. Signs
of previous repairs to the mullions of the skylight were observed. Several fastener heads
were observed to not be in full contact with the skylight frame and could provide path for
water to enter into the skylight frame. The roof areas at the base of the skylight slope were
found to wet during the test cut in this area, and water was observed collecting within the
flutes of the metal deck. 
4.  Roof flashing heights were generally observed to meet or exceed the industry recommended
standard of 8” minimum. The addition of insulation may affect limited areas around select
rooftop unit curbs. 
5.  Visible flashing membrane installed at rooftop equipment curbs appears in good condition
however, patches installed at seams and corners are delaminated. 
6.  Results of the roof infrared (IR) thermographic survey revealed areas of potential wet
insulation at the following locations: 
a. Along the north and south edges of Roof Area A. 
b. The southern portion of Roof Area E. 
c. A significant portion of Roof Areas G, H, I, J. Most notably were areas where roof repairs
had previously been preformed as well as along the length of the low side of the skylight
assembly. 
d. The southern portion of Roof Area L. 
e. Due to access restrictions, Gale did not review the existing conditions at Roof Areas B and
M but based on the infrared images and Gale’s observations at similar roofing condition
areas of limited moisture are anticipated to exist on these roof areas. 
Destructive Testing
Following the infrared scan of the roof that was performed to confirm the findings of the infrared
roof scan. On Wednesday, September 9, 2020, a representative from Gale coordinated with
Greenwood Industries, Inc. (Greenwood) to perform destructive test cuts to determine existing
conditions at select areas of the low sloped roofs. Test cuts were performed in areas suspected to
contain moisture based on the infrared scan. In total, thirteen (13) test cuts, most of which were
approximately 6” square in size, were performed on the existing low sloped roof systems. Test cut
locations were patched by Greenwood following Gale’s review of the test cut locations. Please note
that the test cuts we observed were representative, and not indicative of each condition that may
exist on the building. Refer to the following roof plan for approximate test cut locations, Figure 3.

Test cuts on low sloped roofs revealed the following cross section from top to bottom: 
•  Stone ballast
•  Multi-ply built-up roofing
•  ½” flat stock fiberboard coverboard
•  2.5 inchers of flat stock polyisocyanurate (polyiso) insulation 
•  Corrugated metal deck
•  There was no vapor barrier (VB) membrane observed in any of the test cut locations.

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
New construction, as well as repair and alteration of existing buildings in Massachusetts, is
regulated by 780 CMR, Massachusetts State Building Code (MSBC), and 521 CMR, The Architectural
Access Board (AAB).  The code review was based on the proposed renovations being constructed
under the 9th Edition of the MSBC which is based upon the International Building Code 2015 (IBC) 
and the Massachusetts Amendments. The 9th Edition is reportedly based upon the 2015 versions
of the International Building Code (IBC),  International Existing Building Code (IEBC),  2018
International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), and along with Massachusetts Amendments. 
Under the 9th Edition of the MSBC Chapter 34 Existing Structures refers to the International Existing
Building Code 2015 (IEBC) as modified by the Massachusetts Amendments. This section of the code
applies when there are repairs, alterations, additions or a change in use to existing buildings and
generally refers to other sections of 780 CMR for specific requirements. Alterations to existing
buildings including the removal and replacement of building elements with a continuation of the
same use group (as is the case for the roof replacement at the FHS) are governed by Chapter 6, 
Alterations – Level 1: 
6 
287
Page 288
•  Section 602: Building Elements and Materials – Generally, existing buildings must be
modified in a manner that does not decrease safety. 
•  Section 603: Fire Protection – At this time, Gale does not anticipate any modifications to
the existing fire protection system. 
•  Section 604: Means of Egress – It is Gale’s understanding that the building is fully compliant
with egress requirements. No modifications to egress components are anticipated. 
•  Section 605: Accessibility – Gale recommends that FPS confirm that the building conforms
with the MAAB requirements or perform a compliance study. 
Based on the current scope of work and anticipated costs, FPS should confirm that the
renovations not exceed 30% of the full and fair cash value of the facility and will not require
additional accessibility improvements. As the project will exceed $500,000, a minimum
accessible entrance and bathroom will be required if not already present. Gale
recommends that FPS confirm that the building conforms with the MAAB requirements or
perform a compliance study. 
•  Section 606: Structural – This section of the code outlines requirements of the alterations
of work where reroofing is required. As part of the evaluation of the existing roofing system, 
Gale completed a gravity load code review of the existing FHS building’s roof framing in
accordance with Chapter 34: Existing Structures, of 780 CMR, the MSBC. Based on our
review and calculations, the following is a summary of our findings: 
•  As this building appears to be Seismic Design Category B, it is Gale’s opinion this
section of the code does not apply for this project. 
•  Because the basic wind speed for the City of Framingham is 130 mph and the building
appear to be classified as Occupancy Category III, this section of the code does not
appear to apply for this project. 
•  The proposed replacement at FMS building is not anticipated to increase the roof dead
and live load capacity more than 5%.
Due the presence of stone ballast and the potential for displacing stones down the drain, Gale was
not able to confirm the exact sizes and locations of all roof drains and therefore was not able to
confirm the capacity of the existing roof drainage system. However, based on our visual
observations, the existing roof drains of the low slope roof areas appear to provide adequate
drainage, but evidence of ponding water suggests that low lying areas are collecting and retaining
moisture following rain events. A full review of the existing drainage to confirm the capacity of the
existing roof drainage system for compliance with the Massachusetts State Plumbing Code (MSPC) 
should be performed during the design phase of the roof replacement. Additional crickets should
be provided to facilitate drainage from low areas. Secondary overflow drainage may be
recommended at some locations.

DISCUSSION AND OPINIONS
Based on our evaluation of the low sloped roofs, reported leaks, and water observed in the roof
system it is Gale’s opinion that the existing built-up roof assemblies is approaching the end of its
useful service life. The Owner can select to preserve portions of the roofing but based on the
system configuration lacking proper air/vapor barrier components and system transitions, 
continued deterioration of the underlaying system components can affect the overall performance
of the roofing assembly. 
Low Sloped Roof Systems
Based on the observed conditions noted previously, there are five (5) types of roof coverings which
could be considered for the low-slope replacement roof systems at this facility. Each system has its
own chemical and physical properties and proven performance characteristics. Refer to the
appropriate building section for discussions of unique conditions, and how they may affect the final
design recommendations. These membrane systems are as follows: 
1.  Gravel Surfaced Built-Up Roofing (GSBUR) membranes are alternating layers of asphalt, 
reinforcing felts (organic or non-organic) and gravel surfacing similar to the current roof
system. Of the systems discussed herein for low slope applications, the GSBUR is the most
time proven. Properly designed and installed, these systems have shown good longevity. 
GSBUR systems are field fabricated and therefore, considered more workmanship
dependent, and can be susceptible to problems during construction. GSBUR can be applied
with hot asphalt or cold mastics. Hot applied systems are accompanied by the odor of
asphalt and use of 450°F to 500°F asphalt on the roof. The asphalt acts as the waterproofing
materials while the fabric and felts provide the strength. Hot asphalt used to install the
system can have logistic implications due to the strong fumes associated with the asphalt
and the possibility of a fire hazard created by the asphalt kettle application. “Cold-process” 
built-up systems avoid temperature application of asphalt, and as such, have less odor. The
cold process systems offer superior resistance to vandalism but can be difficult to repair. 
Manufacturers of this type of system offer 10-20 and sometimes 30-year material and
workmanship warrantees. 
2.  Styrene – Butadiene – Styrene Granular Surfaced Modified-Bitumen Roof Membranes (SBS) 
are field fabricated and installed in multi-ply (minimum of two) configurations. SBS
membranes can be set in hot asphalt or cold adhesive, or they can be torch applied. With its
thick, puncture resistant, granular surfaced cap sheet, SBS exhibits excellent puncture and
impact resistance similar to the BUR systems. As with cold and hot applied BUR systems, 
modified-bitumen membranes are workmanship dependent and can be susceptible to
problems during construction for contractors not proficient with the installation
requirements. Hot applied systems are accompanied by the odor of asphalt and use of 450°F
to 500°F asphalt on the roof. The asphalt acts as the waterproofing material while the plies
provide the strength. Hot asphalt used to install the system can have logistic implications
due to the strong fumes associated with the asphalt and the possibility of a fire hazard
created by the asphalt kettle or torch application. Cold process systems avoid temperature
application of asphalt, and as such, have less odor and would be a good alternative for this
site. The manufacturers of SBS membrane systems offer 15-20 year and sometimes 30-year
8 
289
Page 290
material and workmanship warranties that are similar with other membrane system
manufacturers. 
3.  Elastomeric Roof Membranes (EPDM - Ethylene Propylene Diene Terpolymer) are single-ply
synthetic rubber membranes which can be installed as a fully adhered or mechanically
attached system. EPDM roof coverings are field fabricated with the seams of the membrane
adhered with adhesive or a two-sided adhesive seam tape. The adhered membrane seams
require specific preparation work to conform to the manufacturer’s requirements. It has
been Gale’s experience that the seams of EPDM systems are prone to delamination within
the warranty period and unless leaks occur, are not repaired under warranty. Proper slope
to drain is required to effectively remove water from the membrane surface and is critical
for extended surface life and warranty coverages. Some EPDM warranties have specific
limitations excluding ponded water as a result of seam adhesive degeneration when exposed
to prolonged moisture. EPDM sheets are prefabricated off-site in the manufacturer’s plants
by making large sheets of membrane that are installed in “panels” on the site. Each of these
panels are then adhered together using the bonding adhesives or pre-manufactured tapes
to provide a watertight roof. These systems have a lower puncture resistance compared to
the SBS, but their repairability is good and can easily be performed by certified maintenance
personnel. 
Gale is aware of 15-year-old EPDM systems which are currently performing satisfactorily. 
However, it is Gale’s experience that after seven to ten years, maintenance in the form of
seam repairs will be required. Manufacturers of this type of system typically offer 10 to 20-
year materials and workmanship warranties and have recently promoted thicker membranes
that carry a 30-year warranty. Gale would recommend stripping-in all field fabricated seams
if EPDM is specified, as well as designing for complete removal of all water through proper
slope to drain (i.e. additional tapered insulation).
4.  Single-ply thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) roof membranes are also single-ply membranes
that are available from several manufacturers. TPO membranes are manufactured in wide
rolls similar to that of the EPDM sheets and can be adhered with a bonding adhesive, or in
some cases with a self-adhesive backing, to the insulation system. TPO membrane seams
are thermally fused (hot air welded or in some cases solvent welded depending on the
manufacturer’s requirements) to form a monolithic sheet that does not rely on adhesives for
a watertight bond. Warranties that are competitive with SBS and EPDM systems are
available. TPO warranties do not typically contain a ponded water exclusion as a result of
the thermally fused seams. Similar to the EPDM systems, the puncture resistance of the TPO
membrane is lower than that of SBS. It should be noted that repairs to TPO membrane can
often be difficult as the top surface of the membrane ages, making future welding
problematic. Also, there are multiple manufacturers of TPO systems, with multiple
formulations and differing material characteristics. These different characteristics do not
allow for accurate monitoring of the product’s track record. It should also be noted that
there have been several reports of premature aging and failures of TPO systems, which is
assumed to be a direct result of modifying the formulations in an attempt to modify the final
roofing product. Should TPO’s be considered, additional walkway pads should be used as
the membrane becomes very slippery when exposed to accumulated precipitation. 
9 
290
Page 291
5.  Single-ply thermoplastic (polyvinyl chloride – PVC, or Elvaloy based) roof membranes are
another option. PVC/Elvaloy membrane systems are available from several manufacturers. 
Based on our experience, it is Gale’s opinion that the reinforced coated systems offer
satisfactory chemical/physical properties. PVC/Elvaloy membranes can be installed as a fully
adhered, mechanically attached or a loose laid and ballasted application. Similar to the
EPDM and TPO membranes, the PVC/Elvaloy membrane is manufactured in wide rolls. 
However, the PVC/Elvaloy membrane seams are thermally fused by hot air welds only to
form a monolithic sheet that does not rely on adhesives for a watertight bond. Warranties
that are competitive with GSBUR and EPDM systems are available. PVC/Elvaloy warranties
do not typically contain a ponded water exclusion as a result of the thermally fused seams. 
Similar to the EPDM systems, the puncture resistance of the PVC/Elvaloy membrane is lower
than that of SBS but is easy to repair using handheld heat welding equipment. Gale is aware
of several membrane assemblies in New England which have been performing successfully
for over 20 years. There are European installations of these products reported to be in excess
of 25 years old. Similar to the TPO system, additional walkway pads should be considered
on this membrane as it becomes very slippery when wet. 
Coverboards
As standard polyisocyanurate insulation systems are typically susceptible to puncture from falling
objects, can be crushed if uneven weight is applied, or can allow sharp objects such as tools to
damage the roof membranes proposed, Gale recommends that a dense coverboard be utilized
between the polyisocyanurate and roof membrane components. This coverboard can vary from
manufacturer and roof system, but would either be a moisture resistant gypsum board such as that
manufactured by Georgia-Pacific, a high density isocyanurate as supplied by several single ply
manufactures, or a wood fiberboard insulation as required by the manufacturers of GSBUR or SBS
systems. 
It is however the experience of this office that the moisture resistant gypsum and fiberboard
coverboards are more susceptible to moisture accumulation over long periods of time should water
infiltration or vapor drive issues occur under the roof membrane. Therefore, Gale recommends
that a high density, polyisocyanurate insulation be fully adhered over the attached roof insulation
system to provide a more durable substrate for the roof membrane, as well as reduce the potential
of damage to the roof membrane as a result of potential fastener back-out should the fasteners be
in direct contact with the roof membrane. Some additional review of these products may be
required during the design phase to confirm the intent of the installation requirements. 
Insulation 
There are several types of roof insulation boards that may be considered suitable for application
on these roofs. In a conventional, insulated roof system, only polyisocyanurate insulation has a
higher thermal resistance (R-Value) per inch requiring much less overall insulation thicknesses over
its competitors. Due to the existing positive slope of the roof deck, the use of flat stock insulation
should be considered. The greater thicknesses of insulation may result in additional wood blocking
and raising rooftop equipment to accommodate flashing heights. 
10 
291
Page 292
As referenced, long-term repairs would include the removal and replacement of the existing roof
assemblies down to the roof deck. Replacement would consist of new roof assembly components
that includes, but is not limited to, multiply built-up roof waterproofing, high density insulation
coverboard, rigid flat and tapered insulation, and vapor barrier (VB) membrane, over a base layer
of insulation on top of the existing steel deck. It is Gale’s opinion that an adhered VB membrane
be installed that ties-in to the exterior wall system’s vapor barrier if there is one in place. Roof
replacement would also include new membrane and sheet metal flashings along the perimeter and
around rooftop penetrations. It is Gale’s opinion that throughwall flashings at rising masonry walls
would not need to be replaced but several low rising walls could be clad with roofing to address
potentially low flashing heights due to added tapered insulation. Based on the age of the drains, 
FPS should consider replacement of drain assemblies in conjunction with the roof replacement. 
Thank you for your attention. Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate
to contact us at this office.

PHOTOS
Photo 1 – The initial appearance of the existing conditions at the
Farley Middle School Building appear to indicate a reasonably
sound roofing system. The presence of stone ballast reduces the
ability to identify deficiencies through visual evaluation alone. 
Photo 2 – Through the use of unmanned areal drones equipped
with infrared camera technology, Gale identified several areas
with the potential of containing moisture within the roofing
assembly. 
Photo 3 – In conjunction with the infrared roof scan, Gale utilized
capacitance testing to determine the locations of test cuts. 
Photo 4 – Thirteen (13) individual test cut locations were selected
based on the gather data. In general, the roofing system at the test
locations consists of a gravel surface built-up roofing membrane
installed over a fiberboard coverboard, Polyiso rigid insulation and
a sloped metal deck. 
294
Page 295
Photo 5 – The presence of moisture within the roofing system
components was confirmed with the use of moisture sensitive
test strips. Varying levels of moisture were observed at each of
the test locations where moisture was found. 
Photo 6 – Varying levels of moisture were observed within the
roofing system components at select locations .
Photo 7 – Standing water was observed to be collecting within
the flutes of the corrugated roof deck in select locations. 
Photo 8 – In general, the skylight assembly appears to be in fair
condition, but Gale observed that several fasteners do not appear
to fully engage the mullion covers. The conditions could
potentially provide a path for water to enter the building and
roofing assembly.

BUILDING EXTERIOR EVALUATION
WALSH MIDDLE SCHOOL
14 VERNON STREET
FRAMINGHAM, MA 01701
GENERAL BUILDING INFORMATION
Walsh Middle School (Walsh) was built in 1969. The
two-story building is constructed with a combination
of cast-in-place concrete and brick masonry. Walsh is
middle school housing grades 6 through 8, and it
contains a  cafeteria, kitchen, gymnasium, 
auditorium, library, bathrooms, and assorted
classrooms and offices. 
Gale reviewed the existing building which is reported
to be approximately 201,000 sq. ft. in area. Walsh is
rectangular in shape with two courtyards in the
center. The school has approximately 15,000 sq. ft. 
of 2.5 ft. wide painted steel framed punched
windows with single pane glazing. Walsh also has
sixty-two (62) hollow metal single or double access
doors, some with sidelights and transoms. The
building cladding is composed entirely of brick and
mortar. Expansion joints are dispersed throughout
the building at approximately 20 to 30 ft. intervals, 
and appear to be constructed with a silicone or butyl
selant. The perimeter sealant at windows and doors
also appears to be silicone or butyl. 
REVIEW OF EXISTING DOCUMENTS
To assist Gale in performing the evaluation of Walsh
Middle School, representatives from Framingham
Public Schools provided Gale with the following
documents and drawings: 
1. Walsh Middle School – Information sheets
including contact information, building
information, utility information, building
features and transportation.
2. Walsh Middle School – Floor plans designed by
Be Safe Technologies, Inc. The floor plans
provided room and door numbers.
3. Walsh Middle School – Documents with photos
of the school both from a ground view and an
aerial view.

EXISTING EXTERIOR CONDITIONS
Gale performed a visual evaluation of the building’s
existing exterior cladding, doors, windows and
associated components. The brick masonry
appeared to be in fair condition overall. Step
cracking, efflorescence and deteriorated mortar
were observed occasionally throughout the brick
walls. Stress cracking and spalling were observed
occasionally in the concrete trim and concrete
foundation of the building. Sealant at doors, 
windows and expansion joints is failed in areas. In
addition, window glazing sealant has failed on
approximately half of the building. 
Exterior Observations: 
1. The existing window systems are non-thermally
broken painted steel framed punched windows
with single pane glazing.
2. Window glazing throughout the building is clear
glass. Glazing appears to be in good condition
overall.
3. The steel window frames are in fair to poor
condition. Some frames are rusted at the sill
where window perimeter sealant has failed (Fig.
4).
4. The existing door systems are approximately 3
foot wide, 7 foot tall hollow metal single or
double doors. Some doors have sidelights and
transoms. Doors appear to be in good condition
overall.
5. Approximately 200 linear feet of expansion joint
sealant throughout the building is in fair to poor
condition. Poor condition is evident by cracking
(cohesive failure) and dry, hard texture which
has de-bonded from the brick masonry (adhesive
failure) (Fig. 5).
6. Approximately 25% of all window, door and
louver perimeter sealant has failed. This is
evident by cracking (cohesive failure) and dry,
hard texture which has de-bonded from the brick
masonry (adhesive failure) (Fig. 6).

7. Approximately 50% of all window glazing sealant
has failed. This is evident by cracking (cohesive
failure) and dry, hard texture which has de-
bonded from the window (adhesive failure) (Fig.
7).
8. Approximately 2% of mortar throughout the
building is deteriorated (Fig. 8).
9. Approximately 300 square feet of efflorescence
was observed throughout the building (Fig. 9).
10. Approximately 700 linear feet of stress cracking
was observed throughout the building’s
concrete foundation (Fig. 10).
11. Approximately 150 square feet of spalling was
observed throughout the building’s concrete
foundation and concrete trim (Fig. 11).
12. Approximately 50 linear feet of step cracking was
observed throughout the building’s brick walls
(Fig. 12).
13. Approximately 24 square feet of bowed concrete
trim was observed on the north elevation (Fig.
13).
14. Approximately 150 square feet of spider cracks
were observed in the building’s  concrete
foundation on the south and west elevations (Fig.
14).

DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Gale has evaluated the windows, exterior doors and
cladding at Walsh in an effort to provide Framingham
with a better understanding of their current
condition and serviceability. 
Please note the following exclusions: 
x  Hazardous materials testing was not
conducted as part of this building evaluation.
x  Door and window operation was not
reviewed as part of this building evaluation,
only exterior visual observations of the
doors and windows have been included.
Windows: 
Based on Gale’s visual observations of the window
systems, it is our opinion that the existing steel
framed windows are thermally inefficient and in
poor condition. The aluminum window units are
single glazed and do not have thermally broken
frames or sashes. In addition, the noted deficiencies
of the units are likely to allow air and moisture
infiltration into the building. 
Typically, steel window systems have a service life of
approximately 30 to 40 years depending on the type
of system, frequency of use, maintenance and
exposure to weather. Gale could not locate a
manufacturer’s date stamp on the window frames or
glass components and therefore the age of the
existing windows is unknown. However, it does
appear that the windows are original to the building
and are nearing the end of their useful service life. 
In general, the frame and glazing systems lack
adequate air and moisture protection due to failed
sealants and glazing components and cannot resist
thermal transfer through the conductive metal due
to the lack of a thermal break. Similarly, the single
pane glazing’s offer little resistance to thermal
transfer, or control of solar gains and visible light. 
Therefore, due to the poor thermal performance of
the frames, it is recommended that these systems be
replaced within the next 3 - 5 years. 
Entrances: 
The existing steel storefront entrance framing
appears to be in fair condition, however the it lacks
adequate air and moisture protection due to failed
sealants and glazing components and cannot resist
thermal transfer through the conductive metal due
to the lack of a thermal break. Similar to the windows, 
the single pane glazing offers little resistance to
thermal transfer, or control of solar gains and visible
light. Therefore, due to the poor thermal
performance of the frames and glazing components, 
replacement of all storefront entrances may also be
considered to occur within the next 3 - 5 years when
the window renovations are performed, as it may be
more cost effective to perform the window
renovations under the same contract. 
Exterior Wall Cladding: 
Based on Gale’s visual observations of the brick
masonry, and cast-in-place concrete wall cladding
systems, it is our opinion that, while the masonry is
generally in fair condition, there are several deficient
conditions such as displaced precast panels, step
cracking, deteriorated mortar conditions, and
damaged or loose bricks that could allow the passage
of moisture into the cavity wall. 
The bowed concrete could potentially be due to poor
form work during construction but should be
reviewed by a structural engineer. Brick masonry
units under this area appear loose and present a
potential fall hazard to pedestrians. 
Step cracking, deteriorated mortar joints, and
damaged or loose bricks are a potential source of
moisture infiltration. Long exposures to moisture
may accelerate deterioration of the brick and mortar
and can pose a concern of a freeze/thaw cycle. Note
that spot repointing to address sections of
deteriorated mortar joints may provide a “spotty” 
appearance to the wall surface. 
Based on the current condition of the brick masonry
wall system, it is recommended the previously noted
deficiencies be repaired within the next 0 - 3 years.

COST ESTIMATE
The budget estimates presented in this report have
been broken down for the recommendations listed
for each option. These estimates, which are based on
current construction costs, should be considered
preliminary and should not be used for sensitive
budgeting. All estimating was performed using
historical and market trends to establish unit pricing. 
These estimates have been generated by various
sources and may not reflect the actual conditions at
the time of construction. These budget estimates do
not include additional engineering evaluation or
design services, construction administration services, 
or permitting costs. These budget estimates also do
not include soft costs associated with Walsh’s
project management, site supervision, designer fee’s
or site renovations associated with the site logistics. 
The line items within the estimate include a ten-
percent (10%) design and construction contingency, 
as a defined scope has not been determined, as well
as to account for potential unforeseen conditions
that may be encountered. Framingham may want to
budget the recommended work as follows: 
Total Estimated Cost: ..…….......................$2,156,095 
*Please note that these budgets are based upon 
2020 construction prices and escalation for delayed 
construction should be considered.

School Roof Repairs for failing roofs at for McCarthy and Dunning Elementary Schools 
Partial recommendation of $5,643,437 requested for the design and construction for
roof repairs at the McCarthy and Dunning Elementary Schools. The district was recently
notified this project was not accepted in the MSBA’s accelerated repair program. 
Replacement of failing roofs at McCarthy (Phase I) and Dunning. 
We have submitted a SOI to the MSBA for their accelerated roof repair program to
potential help reduce the cost of these replacements for the City. We are awaiting a
decision on whether the District has been accepted into the program. Both roofs are
failing, experience moisture infiltration at numerous locations, fascia damage, and either
expired warranties or warranty is set to expire within the next fiscal year.

2. Roof Repairs/Replacements - Dunning and McCarthy Elementary (SOI’s
Submitted to MSBA)
FY23:
This request for capital budget funding is for the design and construction of new roofs at
Dunning and McCarthy Elementary (Phase I) Schools. These roofs are in poor condition and
rapidly deteriorating. Additionally, the warranty for both phases at McCarthy Elementary
have expired while the warranty for Dunning Elementary is set to expire in 2023. Both of
these roofs are experiencing moisture infiltration and deterioration that is requiring full
replacement in order to ensure the continued usage of the school. The Department has
submitted a statement of interest to the MSBA for the accelerated repair program for both
roofs, and is awaiting follow up from the MSBA on whether the City has been accepted into
the program for these roofs. However, as part of the MSBA program, the City is required to
allocate full project costs within a given timeline, which this funding request would
accomplish.

Executive Summary
In accordance with our contract, Gale Associates, Inc. (Gale) has prepared a roof condition survey
for the Framingham Public Schools (FPS).  This submission relates specifically to the existing
condition of the low-sloped roof areas at the Charlotte A. Dunning Elementary School (DES), located
at 48 Frost St. Framingham, Massachusetts. This report includes descriptions of the existing
conditions, photo documentation, and provides roof remediation options. 
The existing roofing systems at DES consists of multi-ply built-up roofing assembly adhered to 2
inches of rigid polyisocyanurate insulation. The roof deck at the DES was observed to consist of
sloped light weight concrete. Based on our observations, reported leaks and test cuts, portions of
the roof system components are wet and allowing moisture infiltration and reported leaks. The
system appears to be approaching the end of its useful service life. 
As part of the evaluation, a thermographic infrared roof scan and exploratory test cuts were
performed and based on the results, Gale recommends a partial roofing system replacement and
full roof edge perimeter remediation be considered at the Dunning Elementary School. Additional
deficiencies observed include the lack of effective slope to direct moisture to the drains resulting
in areas of ponding water, deteriorated roofing lap seams between reinforcing plys, deteriorated
perimeter roof/ expansion joint flashing transitions and the presence of water within the roofing
system in select locations. 
•  Roof Area F appeared to exhibit the most widespread signs of moisture within the roofing
system. It is Gale’s opinion that Roof Area F be considered for immediate removal and
replacement.
•  Select areas within Roof Areas A and G where also found to contain moisture within the roofing
system components in the location were test cuts were performed. Although the areas of
discovered moisture appear to be isolated, the underlying deteriorating condition of the
existing roofing system components has contributed to the moisture infiltration.
•  Its Gale’s opinion that Roof Areas A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, and J also be considered for replacement
based on the discovery of moisture within the roofing system in areas of previous repairs,
evidence of widespread water ponding, and the observations of deteriorating roofing
membrane condition where gravel surfacing has been displaced. Continued exposure to
moisture can affect the underlying structural components of the roof.
Please note that the estimated cost noted below does not include any special permitting fees which
may or may not be required for this project, additional engineering fees, Framingham’s monitoring
of the project, interior renovations beyond those that are described within this report, a
construction trailer/office space, or soft costs associated with working with Framingham Public
Schools. Again, these recommended budgets are preliminary, and should not be used for sensitive
budgeting, as the final scope of work, and detailing has not been confirmed at this time. 
Estimated Remediation Cost: 
•  Limited System Replacement with a Multi-ply Built-up Roofing System: $2,000,000
•  Full System Replacement with a Multi-ply Built-up Roofing System: $3,650,000
•  Full System Replacement with a Single-ply PVC Roofing Membrane: $2,600,000
•  Full System Replacement with a Single-ply Kee Roofing Membrane: $2,650,000

Figure 1: Dunning Elementary School Roof Area Plan 
Background 
The Charlotte Dunning Elementary School (Dunning) was built in 1965. The single-story building is
constructed with a combination of concrete masonry units (CMU) and brick masonry. Dunning is
an elementary school housing grades K through 5, and it contains a cafetorium, kitchen, 
gymnasium, library, bathrooms, and assorted classrooms and offices. The rectangular shaped
building is clad in a composite of aluminum storefront windows, hollow metal access doors, and
brick and mortar exterior walls. 
The existing approximately 61,500 sq. ft. roof area at the DES includes low sloped and limited areas
of steep sloped roofs. The areas of steep sloped roofs consist of an aluminum coating clad, multiply
built up roofing assembly. The low sloped roof system consists of gravel surface built-up roofing
assemblies incorporating multiple plys of reinforcing fabric that are adhered with an asphaltic based
2 
318
Page 319
adhesive to the top facer of flat stock, 2-inch polyisocyanurate rigid insulation. The roofing system
is installed on a sloped light weight concrete deck with penetrations for several small air
conditioners units and HVAC vents located within the roof areas. 
Visual Evaluation
As part of the evaluation, Gale conducted a visual evaluation of the DES’s roof areas to observe the
extent and location of defects as well as locate areas of potential moisture infiltration using non-
destructive capacitance metering and infrared thermography. The following is a synopsis of the
observations made during our visual evaluation.

Low Sloped Roofs, Roof Areas A, C, D, E, F, G, and J
Gale’s general observations include but are not limited to the following: 
1.  The existing roof drains generally consist of lead and okum set cast iron assemblies that
appear to be in fair condition however, they exhibit surface rust in the bowls and on drain
hardware. Cast iron strainers are generally in good condition but are dislodged from the
clamping rings at some locations.
2.  Numerous previously performed repairs were evident based on the quantity of stripped-in
membrane seams and roof patches that were observed in the field of the roof and at roof-
to-wall flashings. The repairs appear to be in fair condition, but the presence of the stone
ballast created difficulties in confirming the extent of the repairs and condition of the patch
perimeters which are typically more susceptible to failure and allowing moisture infiltration.
3.  The roof to wall, roof expansion joints and roof transitions between roof areas were
observed to be heavily deteriorated. The roof to wall and roof expansion joint conditions
appear to have been painted with a reflective coating that was observed to be failing.
4.  The current roof flashing heights were generally observed to meet or exceed the industry
recommended standard of 8” minimum. The addition of insulation may affect limited areas
around select rooftop unit curbs.
5.  An area of exposed roofing membrane reinforcing plys were observed to be exposed within
a select area within Roof Area C.
6.  Roof access ladders to Roof Areas B and H were observed to be heavily deteriorated and
rusted.
7.  Results of the roof infrared (IR) thermographic survey revealed areas of thermal anomalies
and potential wet insulation at the following locations:
a. Several limited areas within Roof Areas A, E, G, and J where anomalies were identified
could potentially indicate wet roofing system components.
Steep Sloped Roof Areas B, I, and H
1.  Due to the presence of the reflective coating over the roof membrane, Gale was unable to
utilize the infrared camera to review the integrity of the sloped Roof Areas B, I, and H for
areas of potential moisture due to interference caused by the presence of the reflective
coating applied to the existing roofing.
2.  Roof membrane laps were observed to be opening and showing signs of delamination.

Destructive Testing
On Wednesday, September 9, 2020, a representative from Gale coordinated with Greenwood
Industries to perform destructive test cuts to determine existing conditions at select areas of the
low sloped roofs. Test cuts were performed to document representative existing details and as-
built conditions, as well as subsurface conditions at the roof openings. In total, fourteen (14) test
cuts, most of which were approximately 6” square in size, were performed on the existing low
sloped roof systems. Test cut locations were patched by Greenwood following Gale’s review of the
test cut locations. Please note that the test cuts we observed were representative of details that
were observed during the evaluation, and not indicative of each detail condition that may exist on
the building. Refer to the following roof plan for approximate test cut locations, Figure 3. 
Test cuts on low sloped roofs revealed the following cross section from top to bottom: stone
ballast, multi-ply built-up roofing, 2 inches of flat stock polyisocyanurate (polyiso) insulation, 
adhesive attached single-ply vapor barrier installed over a sloped light weight concrete roof deck. 
Test cuts on low sloped roofs revealed the following cross section from top to bottom:

DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
New construction, as well as repair and alteration of existing buildings in Massachusetts, is
regulated by 780 CMR, Massachusetts State Building Code (MSBC), and 521 CMR, The Architectural
Access Board (AAB).  The code review was based on the proposed renovations being constructed
under the 9th Edition of the MSBC which is based upon the International Building Code 2015 (IBC) 
and the Massachusetts Amendments. The 9th Edition is reportedly based upon the 2015 versions
of the International Building Code (IBC),  International Existing Building Code (IEBC),  2018
International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), and along with Massachusetts amendments. 
6 
322
Page 323
Under the 9th edition of the MSBC Chapter 34 Existing Structures refers to the International Existing
Building Code 2015 (IEBC) as modified by the Massachusetts Amendments. This section of the code
applies when there are repairs, alterations, additions or a change in use to existing buildings and
generally refers to other sections of 780 CMR for specific requirements. Alterations to existing
buildings including the removal and replacement of building elements with a continuation of the
same use group (as is the case for the roof replacement at the FHS) are governed by Chapter 6, 
Alterations – Level 1: 
•  Section 602: Building Elements and Materials – Generally, existing buildings must be
modified in a manner that does not decrease safety.
•  Section 603: Fire Protection – At this time, Gale does not anticipate any modifications to
the existing fire protection system.
•  Section 604: Means of Egress – It is Gale’s understanding that the building is fully compliant
with egress requirements. No modifications to egress components are anticipated.
•  Section 605: Accessibility – Gale recommends that FPS confirm that the building conforms
with the MAAB requirements or perform a compliance study.
Based on the current scope of work and anticipated costs, FPS should confirm that the
renovations do not exceed 30% of the full and fair cash value of the facility and will not
require additional accessibility improvements. As the project will exceed $500,000, a
minimum accessible entrance and bathroom will be required if not already present. Gale
recommends that FPS confirm that the building conforms with the MAAB requirements or
perform a compliance study.
•  Section 606: Structural – This section of the code outlines requirements of the alterations
of work where reroofing is required. As part of the evaluation of the existing roofing system, 
Gale completed a gravity load code review of the existing FHS building’s roof framing in
accordance with Chapter 34: Existing Structures, of 780 CMR, the MSBC. Based on our
review and calculations, the following is a summary of our findings:
•  As this building appears to be Seismic Design Category B, it is Gale’s opinion this
section of the code does not apply for this project.
•  Because the basic wind speed for the City of Framingham is 130 mph and the building
appear to be classified as Occupancy Category III, this section of the code does not
appear to apply for this project.
•  The proposed replacement at FMS building is not anticipated to increase the roof dead
and live load capacity more than 5%.
Due the presence of stone ballast and the potential for displacing stones down the drain, Gale was
not able to confirm the exact sizes and locations of all roof drains and therefore was not able to
confirm the capacity of the existing roof drainage system. However, based on our visual
observations, the existing roof drains of the low slope roof areas appear to provide adequate
drainage, but evidence of ponding water suggests that low lying areas are collecting and retaining
moisture following rain events. A full review of the existing drainage to confirm the capacity of the
existing roof drainage system for compliance with the Massachusetts State Plumbing Code (MSPC) 
should be performed during the design phase of the roof replacement. Additional crickets should
7 
323
Page 324
be provided to facilitate drainage from low areas. Secondary overflow drainage may be
recommended at some locations. 
DISCUSSION AND OPINIONS
Low Sloped Roofs
Based on our limited evaluation of the low sloped roofs, select areas of the roof were found to have
experience water infiltration. The limited areas should be removed and replaced to a point that dry
roofing system components can be identified. Roof Area F appears to suffer the most from water
infiltration as moisture was discovered in the roofing system components as well as on the roof
deck. It is Gale opinion that roof areas found to contain moisture should be considered for
replacement. Adding to the presence of moisture within the roofing system, areas of exposed
roofing membrane are showing its age based on the numerous roofing system patches throughout
the roof. Aside from the areas where moisture was discovered in the roofing system components, 
the Owner can select to preserve portions of the roofing, but the system overall should be
considered for remediation to preserve the service life of the building. 
Low Sloped Roof Systems
Based on the observed conditions previously noted, there are five (5) types of roof coverings
which could be considered for the low-slope replacement roof systems at this facility. Each
system has its own chemical and physical properties and proven performance characteristics. 
Refer to the appropriate building section for discussions of unique conditions, and how they may
affect the final design recommendations. These membrane systems are as follows: 
1.  Gravel Surfaced Built-Up Roofing (GSBUR) membranes are alternating layers of asphalt,
reinforcing felts (organic or non-organic) and gravel surfacing similar to the current roof
system. Of the systems discussed herein for low slope applications, the GSBUR is the most
time proven. Properly designed and installed, these systems have shown good longevity.
GSBUR systems are field fabricated and therefore, considered more workmanship
dependent, and can be susceptible to problems during construction. GSBUR can be applied
with hot asphalt or cold mastics. Hot applied systems are accompanied by the odor of
asphalt and use of 450°F to 500°F asphalt on the roof. The asphalt acts as the waterproofing
materials while the fabric and felts provide the strength. Hot asphalt used to install the
system can have logistic implications due to the strong fumes associated with the asphalt
and the possibility of a fire hazard created by the asphalt kettle application. “Cold-process”
built-up systems avoid temperature application of asphalt, and as such, have less odor. The
cold process systems offer superior resistance to vandalism but can be difficult to repair.
Manufacturers of this type of system offer 10-20 and sometimes 30-year material and
workmanship guarantees.
2.  Styrene – Butadiene – Styrene Granular Surfaced Modified-Bitumen Roof Membranes (SBS)
are field fabricated and installed in multi-ply (minimum of two) configurations. SBS
membranes can be set in hot asphalt or cold adhesive, or they can be torch applied. With its
thick, puncture resistant, granular surfaced cap sheet, SBS exhibits excellent puncture and
impact resistance similar to the BUR systems. As with cold and hot applied BUR systems,
modified-bitumen membranes are workmanship dependent and can be susceptible to
problems during construction for contractors not proficient with the installation
8

requirements. Hot applied systems are accompanied by the odor of asphalt and use of 450°F
to 500°F asphalt on the roof. The asphalt acts as the waterproofing material while the plies
provide the strength. Hot asphalt used to install the system can have logistic implications
due to the strong fumes associated with the asphalt and the possibility of a fire hazard
created by the asphalt kettle or torch application. Cold process systems avoid temperature
application of asphalt, and as such, have less odor and would be a good alternative for this
site. The manufacturers of SBS membrane systems offer 15-20 year and sometimes 30-year
material and workmanship warranties that are similar with other membrane system
manufacturers. 
3.  Elastomeric Roof Membranes (EPDM - Ethylene Propylene Diene Terpolymer) are single-ply
synthetic rubber membranes which can be installed as a fully adhered or mechanically
attached system. EPDM roof coverings are field fabricated with the seams of the membrane
adhered with adhesive or a two-sided adhesive seam tape. The adhered membrane seams
require specific preparation work to conform to the manufacturer’s requirements. It has
been Gale’s experience that the seams of EPDM systems are prone to delamination within
the warranty period and unless leaks occur, are not repaired under warranty. Proper slope
to drain is required to effectively remove water from the membrane surface, and is critical
for extended surface life and warranty coverages. Some EPDM warranties have specific
limitations excluding ponded water as a result of seam adhesive degeneration when exposed
to prolonged moisture. EPDM sheets are prefabricated off-site in the manufacturer’s plants
by making large sheets of membrane that are installed in “panels” on the site. Each of these
panels are then adhered together using the bonding adhesives or pre-manufactured tapes
to provide a watertight roof. These systems have a lower puncture resistance compared to
the SBS, but their reparability is good and can easily be performed by certified maintenance
personnel.
Gale is aware of 15-year-old EPDM systems which are currently performing satisfactorily.
However, it is Gale’s experience that after seven to ten years, maintenance in the form of
seam repairs will be required. Manufacturers of this type of system typically offer 10 to 20-
year materials and workmanship warranties and have recently promoted thicker membranes
that carry a 30-year warranty. Gale would recommend stripping-in all field fabricated seams
if EPDM is specified, as well as designing for complete removal of all water through proper
slope to drain (i.e. additional tapered insulation).
4.  Single-ply thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) roof membranes are also single-ply membranes
that are available from several manufacturers. TPO membranes are manufactured in wide
rolls similar to that of the EPDM sheets and can be adhered with a bonding adhesive, or in
some cases with a self-adhesive backing, to the insulation system. TPO membrane seams
are thermally fused (hot air welded or in some cases solvent welded depending on the
manufacturer’s requirements) to form a monolithic sheet that does not rely on adhesives for
a watertight bond. Warranties that are competitive with SBS and EPDM systems are
available. TPO warranties do not typically contain a ponded water exclusion as a result of
the thermally fused seams. Similar to the EPDM systems, the puncture resistance of the TPO
membrane is lower than that of SBS. It should be noted that repairs to TPO membrane can
often be difficult as the top surface of the membrane ages, making future welding
problematic. Also, there are multiple manufacturers of TPO systems, with multiple
9 
325
Page 326
formulations and differing material characteristics. These different characteristics do not
allow for accurate monitoring of the product’s track record. It should also be noted that
there have been several reports of premature aging and failures of TPO systems, which is
assumed to be a direct result of modifying the formulations in an attempt to modify the final
roofing product. Should TPO’s be considered, additional walkway pads should be used as
the membrane becomes very slippery when exposed to accumulated precipitation. 
5.  Single-ply thermoplastic (polyvinyl chloride – PVC, or Elvaloy based) roof membranes are
another option. PVC/Elvaloy membrane systems are available from several manufacturers.
Based on our experience, it is Gale’s opinion that the reinforced coated systems offer
satisfactory chemical/physical properties. PVC/Elvaloy membranes can be installed as a fully
adhered, mechanically attached or a loose laid and ballasted application. Similar to the
EPDM and TPO membranes, the PVC/Elvaloy membrane is manufactured in wide rolls.
However, the PVC/Elvaloy membrane seams are thermally fused by hot air welds only to
form a monolithic sheet that does not rely on adhesives for a watertight bond. Warranties
that are competitive with GSBUR and EPDM systems are available. PVC/Elvaloy warranties
do not typically contain a ponded water exclusion as a result of the thermally fused seams.
Similar to the EPDM systems, the puncture resistance of the PVC/Elvaloy membrane is lower
than that of SBS, but is easy to repair using handheld heat welding equipment. Gale is aware
of several membrane assemblies in New England which have been performing successfully
for over 20 years. There are European installations of these products reported to be in excess
of 25-years old. Similar to the TPO system, additional walkway pads should be considered
on this membrane as it becomes very slippery when wet.
Coverboards
As standard polyisocyanurate insulation systems are typically susceptible to puncture from falling
objects, can be crushed if uneven weight is applied, or can allow sharp objects such as tools to
damage the roof membranes proposed, Gale recommends that a dense coverboard be utilized
between the polyisocyanurate and roof membrane components. This coverboard can vary from
manufacturer and roof system, but would either be a moisture resistant gypsum board such as that
manufactured by Georgia-Pacific, a high density isocyanurate as supplied by several single ply
manufactures, or a wood fiberboard insulation as required by the manufacturers of GSBUR or SBS
systems. 
It is however the experience of this office that the moisture resistant gypsum and fiberboard
coverboards are more susceptible to moisture accumulation over long periods of time should water
infiltration or vapor drive issues occur under the roof membrane. Therefore, Gale recommends
that a high density, polyisocyanurate insulation be fully adhered over the attached roof insulation
system to provide a more durable substrate for the roof membrane, as well as reduce the potential
of damage to the roof membrane as a result of potential fastener back-out should the fasteners be
in direct contact with the roof membrane. Some additional review of these products may be
required during the design phase to confirm the intent of the installation requirements. 
10 
326
Page 327
Insulation 
There are several types of roof insulation boards that may be considered suitable for application
on these roofs. In a conventional, insulated roof system, only polyisocyanurate insulation has a
higher thermal resistance (R-Value) per inch requiring much less overall insulation thicknesses over
its competitors. Due to the existing positive slope of the roof deck, the use of flat stock insulation
should be considered. The greater thicknesses of insulation may result in additional wood blocking
and raising rooftop equipment to accommodate flashing heights. 
As referenced, areas where moisture was discovered within the roofing system components the
system remediation would consist of the installation of and adhesively attached system including a
high-density insulation cover board, rigid flat and tapered insulation. Full roofing system
replacement could incorporate the existing vapor barrier given all deficiencies are corrected prior
to the placement of the new roofing system. For areas where the existing roofing insulation was
found to be dry, remediation could include, but not be limited to removal of all loose gravel
surfacing, repairing any observed damages to the existing roofing system multiply roofing, 
mechanical attachment of rigid insulation and adhesive attachment of a multiply built-up roof
waterproofing and granular surfaced cap sheet. Roof remediation would also include new
membrane and sheet metal flashings along the perimeter and around rooftop penetrations. Based
on the age of the drains, FPS should consider replacement of drain assemblies in conjunction with
the roof replacement. 
Thank you for your attention. Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate
to contact us at this office.

PHOTOS
Photo 1 – The initial appearance of the existing conditions at the
Dunning Elementary School Building appear to indicate a
reasonably sound roofing system. The presence of stone ballast
reduces the ability to identify deficiencies through visual
evaluation alone. 
Photo 2 – Through the use of unmanned areal drones equipped
with infrared camera technology, Gale identified several areas
with the potential of containing moisture within the roofing
assembly. 
Photo 3 – In conjunction with the infrared roof scan, Gale utilized
capacitance testing to determine the locations of test cuts. 
Photo 4 – Fourteen (14) individual test cut locations were selected
based on the gather data. In general, the roofing system at the test
locations consists of a gravel surface built-up roofing membrane
installed over Polyiso rigid insulation, vapor retarder and a sloped
light weight concrete deck.

School Department
Continuation of ADA upgrades throughout the district specifically at Walsh Middle and
Framingham High School
Continued access upgrades throughout the district, specifically at Walsh and FHS.

4. ADA Compliance Upgrades - District-wide Improvements
FY23:
This request for capital budget funding is for the continued improvements focused on eliminating 
architectural barriers related with accessibility at all Public School Buildings. The Buildings &
Grounds Department has undertaken a number of upgrades and improvements District-wide 
focused on providing accessibility to School facilities for all. The FY2023 proposal includes 
replacement of the aging chair lift at Walsh Middle School, and installation of a new chair lift at 
Framingham High School. The lift at Walsh Middle School is one of the oldest lifts within 
District schools and provides access to two levels within the library. Due to its age and 
deteriorating condition, it is not a piece of equipment that can be relied upon for much longer. It 
is the Department’s goal to replace this needed piece of equipment prior to complete failure, 
which would leave the main level of the library inaccessible to students and staff. Additionally, 
there is a lack of an accessible lift at Framingham High School. The purchase and installation of a
lift at FHS would help eliminate architectural access barriers and provide all students, staff, and 
parents with additional access points to the second floor. The Disabilities Commission has 
generously contributed $20,000 to this project, helping to lower the cost carried onto taxpayers. 
The Department will also undertake additional ADA compliance upgrades District-wide if 
funding is remaining on this project.
Total Requested  $300,000

Carol,
Attached are drawings and specifications for the vertical wheelchair lift at Framingham High School that are ready for
bidding.  Based on recent bidding results,  it is no longer possible to determine an estimated contract amount without
contacting suppliers for major materials, and then, the amount are only valid for a short period of time.  We previously had
an estimated contract amount of $85,000 based on a similar project from pre-COVID.  Estimated contract amounts from
pre-COVID are now bidding at 50 percent to 100 percent more depending on the scope of work.  Currently anything
fabricated of metal or imported from another country are being bid very high to cover contingencies in obtaining raw
materials, fabrication, and shipping.
The wheelchairs are metal products so there are issues with obtaining materials, fabrication, and shipping.  Most
wheelchairs are made in Canada by Garaventa or Savaria  and, while the relationship between countries was good in the
past,the current COVID related conditions and importing are not conducive to the flow of products or materials.
If the project is bid now, I would recommend that the estimate contract amount will be over $150,000 which requires Filed
Sub-bds.  My understanding is that wheelchair lifts are not included in the ELEVATOR Filed Sub-bid category and,
accordingly,there would not be any Filed Sub-bids and the attached documents can be used as submitted with the proper
bidding information included by the City.
Not knowing the issues behind the need for the lift, I suggest that is may be worth considering the timing or the project to
see if bidding conditions improve over the next year.

Technology Department 
Replacement of hardware and subscriptions for web filter, spam filter, mail archiver and
backup solution
Replacement of existing hardware and subscriptions for web filter, spam filter, mail
archiver and backup solution
The city utilizes four separate appliances from Barracuda to provide web filtering, spam
filtering, email archiving with cloud replication and backup of all datasets which includes
offsite cloud replication. These appliances and subscriptions were purchased in FY19
and will be out of warranty and subscription services in FY23. To renew subscriptions
for one year on all four appliances would be $142,500 annually; these subscriptions
include hardware warranty with instant replacement, firmware, spam and web filtering
engine updates, backup and mail archiver cloud replication and the ability to operate
servers in their cloud environment. To keep the hardware up to date and include 5
years of subscription services, the cost would be $499,000, or $166,333/year for 3
years. This includes a discount from the vendor of over 50%.  At $142,500/year for
renewal of the existing subscriptions and hardware, this would save the City $212,501
over the course of 5 years if we purchase the new appliances. By purchasing new
equipment, we are better positioned for the always evolving threat landscape and future
growth requirements.

FY23 Recommended: 
Firewall Replacement $406,782 General Fund
Technology Department 
Firewall replacement for current system at end of life and end of support 
Our current ASA/Firewall will be end of life/end of support. The ASA/Firewall is used to
protect the network from intrusion and is also used to manage remote access to the
network (VPN).  At this time our current equipment can't keep up with the threat
landscape. 
We have diligently kept up with our firewall and Security technology, however presently
we have been reaching some hurdles we cannot currently overcome. We keep hitting
limitations on the software and hardware options due to our current hardware Platform. 
The software in use, Firepower, was not originally written for our hardware. The
software was re-engineered and adapted to the ASA platform; however, we are not
capable of running all of the next-generation features available to us. No new software
is being written for the ASA platform, but Cisco will continue to provide critical security
patches and definition updates until our existing hardware goes end of support. Our
existing firewalls are 6 years old; they have gone end of sale. There is an end of support
date from Cisco of September 30, 2025. 
In today’s world of network security and requirements, the entire network is your
security platform. Framingham has made impressive progress in these areas with our
addition of Cisco AMP (desktop/server Anti-Virus), Cisco Umbrella (DNS inspection and
Blocking), Cisco DUO (multifactor Authentication), and Foresite logging and Monitoring
through ePlus. All these products integrate and interact with each other enhancing our
security foot print all the way out to our remote desktop and ‘edge’ systems. 
Upgrading our Firewalls to new Firepower based hardware and software will improve
integration with these products, thus improving our security posture and increasing the
benefits of our investment. In addition, we will be able to implement SSL decryption
(This is decryption of traffic at the packet level for HTTPS connections). 99% of all web
sites are SSL encrypted for security, however our current firewalls are not capable of
deep inspection of this traffic, which is becoming increasingly necessary. 
Working with Cisco, ePlus and Foresite we have a recommendation for a firewall
replacement, this would be for a HA (high availability) firepower pair of firewalls capable
of running all of the next generation firewall options including SSL decryption with tighter
integrations into our existing security posture. Some additional enhancements and
improvements are: SecureX security platform included, SSL decryption, Ransomware
defense, support enhancements for the remote workforce, to name a few. Without this
investment and the changes in the threat landscape and numerous ransomware attacks
345
Page 346
that are targeting local Municipalities and K-12 Schools, the City of Framingham is at a
high risk. 
In addition, it is recommended that we migrate our Cisco security products into a
security EA (Enterprise Agreement) with Cisco, gaining us a substantial saving over a
three (3) year period and better flexibility on licensing growth.

Vehicle and equipment per Public Work’s vehicle management and replacement
schedule. The procurement and upkeep of equipment is a significant factor in providing
cost-effective and reliable service for systems operation, maintenance, repair, 
rehabilitation and replacements. 
All vehicles and equipment are managed through the Fleet Department and included
within a replacement schedule according to specific criteria, such as age, mileage, and
major repairs needed for continued reliable service. Industry and Framingham DPW
experience indicates that above those thresholds maintenance increases substantially
to assure service reliability, as do major repairs, none of which provide a return on
investment, and they are not sustainable with the current DPW facility and staffing. In
addition to daily service for the various Divisions, nearly all vehicles and equipment are
used for the Department’s snow and ice management program which is particularly
destructive to vehicles.

Priorities for Wastewater Improvements FY23
The Wastewater Division conducts routine investigations of the City’s sewer pipe infrastructure
daily. The Division utilized a closed-circuit television video (CCTV) inspection method with a
robotic camera to capture video and photographic footage of underground sewer pipes. This
investigative technology enables the City to locate sewer system defects. Common sewer pipe
defects include holes, cracks, sags, offset joints, tree roots, and frequent blockages, which lead
to a more significant failure if not addressed. 
Wasewater mains with found defects to be replaced with FY23 funding if approved: 
Anticipated work consists of existing pipe removal and replacement with polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) pipe.

Priorities for Sewer Pump Station Equipment Replacements FY23
The Wastewater Division pump station staff conduct routine inspections of all wastewater pump
stations. During these inspections minor defects are discovered and repaired and general
maintenance is performed. Larger scale defects are also discovered where multiple components
need replacement. These larger defects require designing, planning, procuring, and constructing
with in house staff or sometimes a contractor or consultant. These larger projects are usually a
longer-term project as opposed to a routine replacement. Common projects include but are not
limited to pump motor, pumps, check valves, motor starters, gate valves, air compressors, 
electrical, manifold piping, rail systems, and building or site upgrades. 
Pump stations with found defects to be replaced with FY23 funding if approved: 
•  Mt. Wayte pump station – Eliminate phase converter, replace motors, replace check
valves, replace heater, add generation connection with transfer switch 
•  John McQuinn Pump Station – New electrical service, replace air compressors, replace

Cedar Street Sewer Improvements $110,000 Sewer Enterprise Fund
Sewer Department
Cured in Place Pipe (CIPP) lining of the sewer main and sealing of manholes on Cedar
Street
This funding will provide the ability to CIPP line the sewer main on Cedar St as well as
seal all the manholes. This is important in stopping and preventing infiltration as well as
repairing minor defects and extending the life of the sewer system on this street. 
This work would coincide with the water main replacement as well as the roadway
improvements resulting in a complete top to bottom restoration of Cedar Street. 
Eversource already replaced the gas main in preparation for this project. Reducing
infiltration helps keep the MWRA cost down of treating clean ground water. Repairing
minor defects now with CIPP lining will extend the life of the sewer main reducing the
need for significant capital costs in the near future.

Re: FY2023 Funding for Cedar Street Water Main Replacement & Sewer Lining
Dear Bill: 
This letter provides a brief summary of the flow conditions observed during unidirectional flushing of the Cedar
Street water main, and results of the cctv inspection of the Cedar street sewer main, and offers recommendations for
improvements and estimated associate costs. 
Location
The Cedar Street water and sewer mains run north-south on Cedar Street between Waverly Street and Cypress
Street. The water main is just over 1,800 feet long and is a six-inch diameter, cast-iron main installed in 1909. The
sewer main is approximately 1,500 feet long and is an eight-inch diameter, vitrified clay main installed in 1914. Cedar
Street is located in zoning district “General Residence” (G) which has a principal building or use of one- or two-family
detached dwellings with any other principal use. The lot size range is 8,000 to 43,560 square feet with a minimum
landscaped open space surface ratio of 30% to 50%. Cedar Street is primarily densely-constructed single family and
multifamily residential properties, with the section between Waverly Street and Claflin Street having mixed
residential and commercial/industrial use. Cedar Street is located in south Framingham and in located in District 8. 
Unidirectional Flushing & Water Main Evaluation
The Cedar Street water main is included in Phase 2B of the City’s Water Distribution System Unidirectional Flushing
Program. Unidirectional flushing of Phase 2B was completed in the Fall of 2019. Flushing of Cedar Street was
completed in two parts, flowing north from the intersection of Cedar Street and Pine Street to a hydrant at the
intersection of Cedar Street and Waverly Street (hydrant 1784), then flowing south from the intersection of Cedar
Street and Pine Street to the first hydrant located on Cypress Street, after the intersection of Cedar and Cypress
Streets. 
Cedar Street was flushed from Pine Street to Waverly Street for thirty minutes, during which time the flow from
hydrant 1784 was recorded at 500 gallons per minute (gpm). The section of Cedar Street from Pine Street to Cypress
Street was also flushed for thirty minutes, and a flow rate from hydrant 1956 on Cypress Street was recorded at 300
gpm. Based on the American Water Works Association Manual M31, fire protection for one- and two-family
dwellings not to exceed two stories the required fire flow rate is as follows:

The City’s zoning district and observed building proximity would place the required flow rate for Cedar Street at
1,000 gpm, which is also the flow rate below which the Water Division provides notice of low flow water mains to the
Fire Department. At the time of unidirectional flushing, the Cedar Street water main north of Pine Street experienced
a fire flow deficit of 500 gpm, and south of Pine Street experienced a fire flow deficit of 700 gpm. The Water Division
notified the Fire Department of the flow deficiency on Cedar Street following completion of unidirectional flushing of
Phase 2B along with all other discovered deficiencies. Fire flow deficits have been discovered throughout the City and
have been evaluated under separate cover. 
Water Main Recommendations
The Cedar Street water main was identified as a water main that requires replacement in order to eliminate fire flow
deficits and restore domestic pressure and flow to ratepayers. We have been informed by the Highway Division that
Cedar Street is scheduled for necessary roadway improvements so work to repair the Cedar Street water main before
the roadway improvements begin is a priority. This water main replacement work is being scheduled in coordination
with roadway improvements and sewer lining on Cedar Street in order to minimize disturbances to the street
following completion of new paving. Due to the expeditious schedule and nature of the work, we recommend that
water main replacement work be completed by the Water Division’s on-call contractor. Replacement of this water
main shall include installation of a new 8-inch diameter cement-lined ductile iron water main, fittings, hydrants, 
valves, services, and appurtenances. We have prepared the following estimated cost for construction using the
Water Division’s on-call contractor as follows.

It should be noted that the Cedar Street water main is identified in the City’s 2017 Water System Master Plan as a
recommended improvement in year eight of the plan, or 2026. Including the Cedar Street water main in the
Department’scapital appropriation request for Cedar Street improvements in fiscal year 2023 will allow this
improvement to occur on schedule, address the recently-discovered fire flow deficit, and complete this work before
the scheduled roadway improvements. 
Elimination of cast-iron water mains that are over 100 years old from the water distribution system is a priority of the
Water Division. In addition to having restricted flow and pressure, in general, aged cast-iron water mains are prone
to breaks and requires emergency repairs more frequently. Performing repair work on active water mains in the
distribution system can be a significant challenge for Water Division staff and can frequently lead to extended
disruptions to the water service of our customers. Elimination of water mains that are well beyond their design life is
both prudent and necessary to avoid major infrastructure failures, avoid costly disruptions to our customers, and
provide adequate fire protection for property-owners and residents of the City. 
Closed Caption Television (CCTV) Inspection & Sewer Main Evaluation
In advance of the anticipated roadway work, the Sewer Division performed CCTV inspection of the sewer main and
manholes located on Cedar Street. The Sewer Division cleaned and inspected each section of sewer main and each
manhole to evaluate condition. It was determined that the unlined sections of the Cedar Street sewer main and
associated manholes do not contain major failures, misalignments, or evidence of size constraints of concern. 
Sewer Main Recommendations
While the age of the Cedar Street sewer main is advanced, the condition of the mains and manholes is favorable for
Cured-in-Place-Pipe (CIPP) lining and manhole sealing in lieu of sewer replacement. CIPP lining is also preferred
because there is an existing natural gas main located above the sewer main in the street. Excavation of this sewer
would resultantly be challenging and not advised until which time as the sewer main is determined to have capacity
concerns or is failing. 
As with aged water mains, deferring work on a sewer main of this age and material is not recommended. Vitrified
clay sewer mains of advanced age are known areas of infiltration and inflow, and require more frequent repairs. CIPP
lining and manhole sealing can extend the life of the sewer collection system on Cedar Street and prevent untimely
excavation of the newly-paved roadways for sewer repair work.

We recommend that sewer main replacement work be completed by the Sewer Division’s CIPP lining contractor. The
proposed work shall include CIPP lining of six 8-inch diameter sections (1,350 linear feet) of sewer main on Cedar
Street and one connecting section at the intersection of Pine and Cedar Streets, cutting out 35 sewer laterals, and
sealing five manholes totaling 43 linear feet of manhole sealing. We have prepared the following estimated cost for
construction using the Sewer Division’s CIPP lining contractor as follows.

City of Framingham FY23-27 Capital Improvement Program 
FY23 Recommended: 
Sewer Defect Repairs Phase 3 Design & Construction $300,000 Sewer Enterprise Fund
Sewer Department
Phased and ongoing repairs and construction of high priority sewer main and manhole
defects
Partial recommendation of request for $1,063,450 with consideration of availability of
the Massachusetts Water Resource Authorities’ (MWRA) Infiltration/Inflow Local
Financial Assistance Program 75% grant and 25% 10-year interest free loan for eligible
projects. $300,00 represents the portion of the project that would not be eligible for this
program. This project is contingent upon approval of the MWRA program and will not
move forward otherwise. 
This funding request will allow the city to continue addressing high priority sewer main
and manhole defects. Whenever possible, pipes will be rehabilitated using cured-in-
place pipe (CIPP) or lining techniques. This is more cost effective and doesn’t require
excavation of the road. When lining is not possible, sections of pipe will be replaced. 
Manholes can also be lined in many cases but would be replaced when necessary. 
Framingham has evaluated the condition of approximately 50% of its sewer system
within the last decade, with a focus on identifying high priority sewer repairs. These
high priority repairs include rectifying defects that contribute to infiltration, as well as
spot repairs and rehabilitation that will extend the reliable service life of the sewer
assets. Infiltration is clean water, such as groundwater, that enters the sanitary sewer
system and, in turn, reduces the capacity for wastewater flow. This capacity reduction
can result in system backups and overflows, as well as fee increases from the MWRA, 
which is based on total wastewater flow from Framingham. 
The City has $3.954M available through the MWRA’s Infiltration/Inflow (I&I) Local
Financial Assistance program. This phase of their program provides 75% grant funds
and 25% 10-year interest free loans for eligible projects. This project meets the
eligibility criteria. The next phase (Phase 13) of the MWRA I&I financial assistance
program provides $2.75M as ten-year interest free loans (there is no grant component
to this phase) for eligible projects.

City of Framingham FY23-27 Capital Improvement Program 
FY23 Recommended: 
Gates Street Sewer Pump Station Rehabilitation Design & Construction $2,250,000
Sewer Enterprise Fund
Sewer Department
Repairs to Gates Street Pump Station which was constructed in 1953 and last
rehabilitated in 1984
The Gates Street Pump station was constructed in 1953, last rehabilitated in 1984, and
is in critical need of significant repairs. This budget request is intended to address
specific needs within the station to keep the facility from deteriorating to the point of
needing much more costly full replacement. This request is to take the project from
preliminary design (35% complete) through construction. The proposed project includes
repairs of significant corrosion in the wet well area, replacement of pipe and pumps, 
structural improvements to improve safety and maintenance accessibility, installation of
an emergency generator, electrical and control upgrades, ventilation improvements and
odor control improvements. Construction on this station will require that pumps and
piping be taken off line for replacement. As a result, one of the key cost components
within this budget request will be full bypass pumping during construction. 
The station has key safety and operational issues that require immediate attention. The
existing pumps plug regularly and should be replaced with new state-of-the-art pumps
equipped to minimize plugging. Structural modifications are needed to improve safety
and functionality of accessing the pumps for regular maintenance. The aged suction
and discharge piping in the building need to be replaced to accommodate dimensions
and configuration of replacement pumps. The ventilation system in the wet well is not
functional, and its inability to provide sufficient air flow has led to significant operational
problems and safety issues. There is corrosion in the wet well, concrete spalling from
the walls, and corrosion of electrical switches, door handles and safety railings. Major
station rehabilitations are typically required after about 25 years of operation, but this
station was last rehabilitated 35 years ago. Proceeding with this project will allow the
City to avoid having to undertake a much costlier full replacement in the near future.

Re: FY2023 Capital Budget Request – City of Framingham, MA
Gates St. Wastewater Pumping Station – Design and Construction Services
Dear Ms. Eliot:
This letter serves to recommend that the Department request $2,250,000 in design and construction
funding and provide justification for the above referenced project.
The Gates Street Wastewater Pumping Station was originally constructed in 1953 and was last
rehabilitated 35 years ago. Major station rehabilitations are typically required after approximately 25
years of operations. Proceeding with this rehabilitation project will allow the City to avoid a more costly
pumping station replacement project in the near future.
There are key safety and operational issues that require immediate attention. The existing pumps plug
regularly, requiring constant maintenance by the DPW staff to maintain functionality. The ventilation
system in the wet well is not functional and has not been in service continuously for many years. The
system’s inability to properly ventilate the wet well has led to significant corrosion issues within the
space (concrete walls, electrical switches, door handles, safety railings, etc.), resulting in major safety
hazards.
Proposed improvements include new pumps specifically equipped to minimize plugging, replacement of
the aged piping within the station to accommodate the new pump dimensions and configurations, and
replacement of the building’s HVAC system for proper ventilation. Additionally, structural modifications
will be evaluated to improve the safety and functionality of accessing the pumps for routine
maintenance.
We trust this information meets your current needs. If we can be of any further assistance regarding
this matter, please contact me at our Lincoln, RI office.

The SSES Phase 7 area includes the Angelica Dr./ Lanewood area; the area bounded
by Winter St. & Mt. Wayte Ave.; and the area bounded by Central St., Concord St., &
Summer St. These three areas combine to account for 96,000 linear feet of sewer main. 
The proposed work for SSES Phase 7 includes (a) flow isolation and CCTV to identify
infiltration and (b) smoke testing, dye testing, and building inspections to identify inflow. 
As part of a 2007 Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) 
Administrative Consent Order (ACO), the city is required by DEP to identify sources of
rainwater runoff and groundwater that enter the sanitary sewer system. The addition of
clean water from improper sources uses valuable sewer pipe capacity and can cause
sewer back-ups into homes or sewer overflows onto public streets and into rivers/ponds
during wet weather events. The City of Framingham has approximately 62 miles of
gravity sewer and force main and 240 manholes. Work conducted under SSES Phases
1-5 has resulted in the estimated removal of 50% of the 392,000 gallons per day (gpd) 
of identified infiltration. Phase 6 is currently ongoing. Phase 7 is a continuation of this
DEP mandated program. Sewer miles and manholes within this study area consist of
96,000 linear feet.

Hearth Street, Hollis Court, Lindsay Street, Morse Road and Waushakum Boulevard
Partial recommendation for request of $1,100,000 for fire flow restoration and
improvement program. 
This appropriation will provide funds for the design and replacement of water mains and
appurtenances at locations in the water system identified as having restricted volume
and pressure. The work includes replacement of insufficiently performing water mains, 
fire hydrants, and valves by in-house staff and the City’s on-call utility contractor. The
FY2023 appropriation will continue to fund the Fire Flow Restoration and Improvement
Plan previously funded by the Annual Various Water Improvements and the annual
various Hydrants and Valves improvements. FY23 improvements shall include
replacement of water mains and appurtenances, as needed on Avon Street, Berry
Street, Brackett Road, Draper Road, George Street, Guild Road, Hearth Street, Hollis
Court, Lindsay Street, Morse Road, and Waushakum Boulevard. This appropriation will
also allow the Water Division to replace clusters of old fire hydrants throughout
neighborhoods City-wide as well as deficient hydrants and valves identified by the
Water Division's unidirectional flushing program. 
Elimination of significant pressure and flow restrictions in the water distribution system
is needed to ensure the Fire Department can provide adequate fire protection to
properties throughout the City, and to improve pressure and volume for domestic water
service to ratepayers. 
Replacement of old and/or deficient fire hydrants throughout entire neighborhoods
enhances the Fire Department's ability to efficiently and effectively fight fires. 
Replacement of old hydrants with newer-style hydrants allow Water Division staff to
repair broken or damaged internal components of hydrants, avoiding an excavation. 
This is a much less invasive, cost-effective repair that cannot be completed on older
hydrants. 
Valve replacements allow older leaking or non-functional valves to be removed from the
distribution system and limit water service interruptions when isolations are required for
372
Page 373
planned and emergency work. Valve replacements allow the Water Division to better
maintain the distribution system and impact fewer ratepayers when shutdowns are
necessary.

Dear Stephanie, 
The Framingham Fire Department is in full support of your "Fire Flow Restoration and
Improvement Program." Sufficient and reliable water flow is one of our most important tools
when fighting a fire. Inability to get adequate water flow from hydrants hinders the Fire
Department's ability to protect occupants, provide safety to firefighters and to mitigate damage
to property. The close working relationship between our Department's is critical in maintaining
our high level of service. Because of this close relationship, the Fire Department is aware that
there are several areas within the City, that are "low flow" areas. While knowing that these low
flow areas exist is important, it is vital that the water system be replaced in these
underperforming districts. 
Please let me know how I can be of additional assistance. 
Respectfully, 
Michael D. Dutcher
Fire Chief

These are examples of severely corroded (tuberculated) pipes removed from
a recent DPW improvement project on Wood Terrace. Over time, deposits
form in the pipes, sometimes almost totally restricting flow. Many of these
pipelines are only 6” to begin with, which is smaller than the current industry
standard of 8” minimum diameter.

SECTION 1: Introduction
1.1  Background
In 2017, the Framingham Water Department worked with BETA Group, Inc. to develop a town-wide
unidirectional flushing program. The effort required extensive modeling, flow tests, and mapping to
create an effective plan that Water Department staff could follow in a step wise manner. Unidirectional
flushing is a distribution management best practice. The activity aims to clear sediment and biofilm from
the water distribution system in a systematic fashion, beginning at the water source and progressing
through to the outer reaches of the distribution system. These efforts promote better water quality and
system maintenance. 
Prior to 2018, the Water Department performed annual flushing on dead-end mains and in areas known
to have increased water age or regular water quality complaints, but did not have an optimized City-wide
program. Utilizing a computerized model of the distribution system, the unidirectional flushing program
provided for a more thorough flushing of the distribution system by isolating flushing paths, and
controlling the direction of flow along those paths. 
As the implementation of a comprehensive City-wide flushing program requires significant planning, 
effort, (and at times disruption of service), it was decided that the program would be rolled out over a 4-
year period. The plan requires operation of valves and hydrants across the City, of which many may not
have been operated for years prior to the start of the program. It was expected through the initial rollout
of the program that system deficiencies would be identified, but there was no means to estimate the
extent of those deficiencies without performing the work. 
In the first year, deficiencies were found including: 
•  Failed valves, before their expected service life; 
•  Dead-end water mains, thought to be looped; and
•  Significant fire flow deficiencies, often related to tuberculation in aged pipes. 
Upon identification of the fire flow deficiencies, the Water Department began addressing these
deficiencies through the Annual Various appropriations. As the flushing program has progressed the
extent of deficiencies identified has greatly exceeded the available funding. At the beginning of fiscal year
2022, the Water Department had completed flushing in six of eight zones of the first round of City-wide
flushing. The memorandum that follows serves to summarize the findings of these first six zones and to
set forth a plan to begin addressing these deficiencies. We expect that as the Department continues to
execute the flushing program the list of deficiencies will grow, identifying the majority of deficiencies
through completion of the first full round of flushing, and fewer new deficiencies identified in the
subsequent rounds. It is anticipated that the fire flow restoration plan’s priority improvements will
warrant reprioritization after each successful year of flushing. 
Further, it is worth noting, that the City’s Water Master Plan was completed in 2017 – before these system
data became available. An exercise should be undertaken to reconcile the fire flow restoration priorities
with the capital improvement plan as outlined in the 2017 Water Master Plan. These priorities will be
reconciled in the next revision of the Water Master Plan, anticipated in 2027. It is the Water Department’s
opinion that these significant flow deficiencies should be given the highest priority. The text that follows
outlines the plan used by the Water Department to prioritize the deficiencies identified to date and going
forward. 
3
379
Page 380
1.2  Objective
An analysis of the water main segments identified as having low flow through the unidirectional flushing
program has been assembled herein. The purpose of this memorandum is to identify the limits of the low
flow water mains and to quantify the priorities of each main replacement based on data such as fire flow, 
pipe diameter, age, material, and zoning (to account for population and structure density) where the
mains are located, as well as summarize a plan to address these deficiencies. 
Results of the analysis provide quantifiable data used to assign priority to each recommended
improvement, referred to herein as “Pipe Score.” Pipe Scores were used, in conjunction with estimated
construction costs and relative proximity of each improvement to define a ten-year plan for elimination
of the known fire flow deficits from the water system. 
As the City completes its first full round of the unidirectional flushing program, it is anticipated that more
deficiencies will be identified. Any newly identified pipes will be assessed on the same criteria described
herein and a Pipe Score will be calculated. This will likely become an annual exercise to ensure the
greatest deficiencies are addressed first, to the extent possible. 
The objective of this analysis is to develop a prioritized plan for replacing insufficiently performing water
mains to improve and restore water volume and pressure throughout the water system. 
1.3  Actions Taken and Remediation Plan
Promptly following discovery of any fire flow deficit, the Water Department has notified the Fire
Department of the impacted hydrants. 
The extent of repairs identified are too numerous for the in-house Water Department staff to replace on
their own, in a timely manner. As such, the Department proposes to replace water mains in kind to the
extent practical with the support of the on-call water and wastewater contractor. This is a service that is
bid regularly. In order to make valuable progress on these known deficiencies an annual request for
funding specific to these known fire flow deficiencies is proposed starting in FY23, hereafter referred to
as the “Fire Flow Restoration and Improvement Program.” The following sections provide the means by
which the program was developed. 
In some cases, where the extent of the replacement is deemed to be extensive, or other know
improvements are needed in the area of the area of work, a capital appropriation will be sought through
the Capital Program, so the project will have the with the support of a comprehensive engineering design
and evaluation. These areas have been outlined separately as the identified water mains may be in close
proximity to other significantly aged City-owned infrastructure or significant traffic impacts may result. 
These projects will be more expensive and will benefit greatly from additional planning efforts.

SECTION 2: Evaluation Criteria
2.1  Flow Deficit Identification
The unidirectional flushing program led the Water Department to identify a number of insufficiently-
performing water mains within each flushed zone. These mains produce flows less than the minimum
standard fire protection flow rates. This flow rate is typically 1,000 gallons per minute for the locations
flushed through the spring of 2021. The thresholds based upon building spacing for one and two family
dwellings are outlined in Table 2.1below. 
Table No. 2.1
AWWA Distribution System Requirements for Fire Protection

Distance between buildings Required flow rate

31-100  750
11-30  1,000
<11’  1,500
Source: AWWA Manual M31 Distribution System Requirements for Fire Protection 
The standard additionally requires that all system locations should be capable of providing the minimum
flow rate under maximum day demands without any system pressures dropping below 20 psi. While
pressures at the flowing hydrants were recorded during the unidirectional flushing program, it is not
customary to take pressure readings throughout the system while conducting main flushing. Further, it is
not customary to do system flushing during peak flow periods. As such, there may be additional volume
or pressure deficiencies that have not yet been identified. 
Water mains identified as producing less than 1,000 gpm during execution of the unidirectional flushing
program in 2018 through 2021 are highlighted red in Figure 1, included herewith. 
Historic information for these water mains, including pipe diameter, material, and installation year, as
summarized in the City’s asset management inventory were utilized to further categorize these water
mains. Pipe with the same age, size and material installed adjacent to the problematic sections will also
be considered for replacement under this program and are included. These adjacent pipes have been
highlighted in orange in Figure 1. Together, the red and orange constitute the proposed limits of water
main replacement under this program. 
5
381
Page 382
2.2  Pipe Score 
After the extent of each water main replacement was determined, prioritization of each was performed
by creating a Pipe Score. A Pipe Score Worksheet was developed, wherein the following contributing
categories were defined: Fire Flow Deficit, Diameter, Age, Material, and Zoning District Scores. Each Pipe
Score category was assigned a weighting based on the assigned level of relative priority. The category
weightings serve to quantify the comparative urgency of each consideration for replacement of the water
main. A Pipe Score for each insufficiently-performing main was calculated using the weighted average of
each Pipe Score category. As follows: 
Bulk Pipe Score=  
 + 
 +  
 +  
 + 
 
where: 
Wn 
= Category Weighting
SF 
= Fire Flow Deficit Score 
SD 
= Pipe Diameter Score 
SA 
= Pipe Age Score 
SM 
= Pipe Material Score 
SZ 
= Zoning District Score 
The final Pipe Score was determined using the Bulk Pipe Scores for each segment and dividing each by the
maximum Bulk Pipe Score calculated. This simplified the analysis as the Pipe Score becomes a percentage. 
A score of 100 indicates the pipe segments requiring the most urgent replacement, and lower scores
represent pipes of proportionally lesser urgency: 
where: 
Pipe Score =  ⁄  
∗ 100% 
PS = Bulk Pipe Score
PSmax 
= Maximum Possible Bulk Pipe Score. 
Pipe Scores were used to assign replacement priority to each proposed water main replacement. The
sections that follow describe in detail the calculation of each of the Pipe Score categories defined on the
Pipe Score Worksheet and weightings assigned to each. 
2.2.1 Fire Flow Deficit Score
Fire Flow Deficit Scores were defined for fire flow deficits ranging from 0 gpm to greater than 1000 gpm. 
The fire flow deficit ranges and corresponding scores, as well as category weighting are defined as follows:

Fire Flow Deficit Score was assigned a weighting of ten, the highest weighting of all pipe score categories. 
The Water Department identified fire flow deficit as the most critical characteristic when determining
replacement priority. 2.2.2 Pipe Diameter Score
Pipe Diameter Scores were defined for pipe diameters ranging from 2 inches to greater than 24 inches. 
The Pipe Diameter Scores and category weighting are defined as follows:

Pipe Diameter Score was assigned a weighting of three, the second highest weighting. Prior to this
investigation, the Water Department established as a priority eliminating pipes less than six inches in
diameter from the water system. As the majority of pipes experiencing fire flow deficits are those with
7
383
Page 384
diameters six inches or less, the smallest diameter water mains experiencing fire flow deficits were
assigned higher replacement priority. 
2.2.3 Pipe Age Score
Pipe Age Scores were defined for pipes installed from before 1900 to after 1980. Only one water main
experiencing flow deficits was installed after 1980, and the average installation year was 1927. The Pipe
Age Scores and category weighting are defined as follows:

Pipe Age Score was assigned a weighting of two, below the weighting for Fire Flow Deficit Score and Pipe
Diameter Score. The Water Department as a rule intends to eliminate pipes past their design life from
the water system. The Pipe Age Score category provides for the oldest pipes with fire flow deficits to be
prioritized above those newer pipes in similar condition. 
2.2.4 Pipe Material Score
Pipe Material Scores were defined based on known pipe material present within the water system that
are experiencing low flows. The Pipe Material Scores and category weighting are defined as follows:

Pipe Material Score was assigned a weighting of two, below the weighting for Fire Flow Deficit Score and
Pipe Diameter Score, and equal to Pipe Age Score. While the vast majority of insufficiently-performing
water mains are made from cast iron, the Water Department as a rule intends to eliminate asbestos
cement pipe and any remaining lead-containing pipes from their water system. The Pipe Material Score
category provides for pipes with fire flow deficits that are comprised of undesirable materials to be
prioritized above those pipes made from preferred materials, in similar condition. 
2.2.5 Zoning District Score
Zoning District Scores were defined based on the municipal Zoning District most prevalent along each
water main route. Zoning District Scores are comprised of average scores assigned to a Zoning District, if
the water main route serves multiple Zoning Districts. This category was included to account for
population and structure density of the areas served by insufficiently-performing water mains. The Zoning
District Scores and category weighting are defined as follows:

Zoning District Score was assigned a weighting of two, equal to Pipe Age Score and Pipe Material Score. 
Zoning District Scores prioritize insufficiently-performing mains in areas serving more densely-populated
areas, and those with the smaller distances between structures. Where housing and businesses are
located in closest proximity, failure to provide adequate fire protection is likely to directly impact more
members of the community, and contribute to wider-spread damage to structures. The Water
Department has prioritized eliminating fire flow deficits in areas that may be more vulnerable in a fire
emergency due to population and structure density. 
SECTION 3: Fire Flow Restoration and Improvement Program
Development
3.1  Asset Grouping
Using the City of Framingham’s GIS water main database, insufficiently-performing water mains were
assessed for proximity to one another, and proximate water mains were grouped into an Asset Grouping. 
The Water Department intends to perform work of this program efficiently by minimizing the number of
mobilizations to any particular area and, to the greatest extent possible, completing proximate work
within the same year of the program. Asset Groupings are those water mains that are intended to be
completed at one time, or as one project. 
3.2  Estimated Cost Development
Cost estimates for each insufficiently-performing water main were calculated using the length of each
water main multiplied by an average estimated per linear foot cost of $350. This per linear foot cost was
estimated based on FY2022 costs for comparable work performed by Framingham’s current on-call
contractor, Russo Brothers, Inc. To account for inflation, a two percent per year cost increase was
assessed on each improvement based on the assigned fiscal year. The assignment of fiscal years to Asset
Grouping is described hereafter in 3.3Asset Group Ranking. 
Projects with estimated costs in excess of one million dollars and those determined to be best included as
part of a known larger Capital Improvement project were placed into a separate Capital Improvements
Grouping, and ranked separate from the other Asset Groupings. An estimated per linear foot cost of $650
multiplied by the length of each water main was used to calculate the estimated replacement cost of
water mains in the Capital Improvements Group. The per linear foot cost of Capital Improvements
Grouping work was based on costs associated with similar work performed in FY2022, for the City of
Framingham through the Capital Improvement Program. 
3.3  Asset Group Ranking
Through this program, the Water Department intends to remove and replace all volume- and pressure-
restricted water mains identified during the unidirectional flushing. To date, the City has completed
flushing in six of eight flushing zones and anticipates more insufficiently-performing mains will be
identified. The remaining flushing zones are located in sections of the City where water infrastructure is
newer and anticipate fewer flow deficits than have already been identified. The Fire Flow Restoration and
Improvement Program to date includes over $35 million in water main replacement projects, and is
projected to reach $40 million once the first round of City-wide unidirectional flushing is complete. As
such, the work of the Fire Flow Restoration and Improvement Program is proposed to be distributed over
10
386
Page 387
a period of 20 years, including approximately $1-2 million of improvements each year, beginning in FY2022
(which was deferred) and extending through FY2042, however reduced and deferred appropriations will
extend this schedule beyond the projected period. 
Asset Groupings were ranked and grouped, providing for $1-2 million in water main replacements each
year over a span of approximately 20 years. It is advisable, the City prioritize fire flow restoration
whenever possible to shorten the 20-year program duration, keeping in mind any future-identified fire
flow deficit remediation work shall be added to the existing list, potentially extending the duration of the
program. 
Asset Groupings were ranked according to the highest Pipe Score within their group, and sorted into each
fiscal year, balancing Pipe Score, estimated cost, and proximity in each fiscal year. Figure No. 2: Fire Flow
Restoration Plan Map, included herewith depicts the assigned fiscal year of each Asset Grouping. The
current Fire Flow Restoration and Improvement Program tabulated list of Asset Group Rankings is
attached hereto in Attachment A. 
3.4  Future Flow Deficit Identification
It is the Water Department’sintent to perform the analysis described herein on all subsequently-identified
insufficiently-performing water mains. Pipe Scores will be calculated for all future-identified water mains, 
and estimated costs and Asset Groupings will be determined. Finally, future-identified Asset Groupings
will be ranked and assigned a fiscal year based on the Asset Group Rankings. Thus, as the unidirectional
flushing program progresses, the assigned fiscal year for any individual improvement may shift based on
the relative urgency of any future-identified insufficiently-performing water mains. The Water
Department intends to analyze newly-identified mains with flow deficits each year following completion
of that year’s unidirectional flushing program, and make adjustments to the Fire Flow Restoration and
Improvement Program accordingly.

City of Framingham FY23-27 Capital Improvement Program
FY23 Recommended: 
Cedar Street Area Water Improvements $1,765,500 Water Enterprise Fund
Water Department
Replacement of approximately 1900’ of water main on Cedar Street and 800’ of water
main on Charles Street
This project will include the replacement of approximately 1900' of water main on Cedar
Street and 800' of water main on Charles Street. This includes all appurtenances such
as hydrants, valves, and services to the property line. 
This appropriation will allow for the replacement of undersized 6" CI pipe from 1909 on
Cedar St and undersized 6" CI pipe from 1920 on Charles St. These streets have
500gpm and 300gpm of fire flow respectively. This is insufficient flow for firefighting. The
project will coincide with the sewer work and roadway improvements to allow for a
complete top to bottom restoration of Cedar Street. Eversource has already replaced
the gas main and realigned it out of the way of the water main in anticipation of this
work.

Re: FY2023 Funding for Cedar Street Water Main Replacement & Sewer Lining
Dear Bill: 
This letter provides a brief summary of the flow conditions observed during unidirectional flushing of the Cedar
Street water main, and results of the cctv inspection of the Cedar street sewer main, and offers recommendations for
improvements and estimated associate costs. 
Location
The Cedar Street water and sewer mains run north-south on Cedar Street between Waverly Street and Cypress
Street. The water main is just over 1,800 feet long and is a six-inch diameter, cast-iron main installed in 1909. The
sewer main is approximately 1,500 feet long and is an eight-inch diameter, vitrified clay main installed in 1914. Cedar
Street is located in zoning district “General Residence” (G) which has a principal building or use of one- or two-family
detached dwellings with any other principal use. The lot size range is 8,000 to 43,560 square feet with a minimum
landscaped open space surface ratio of 30% to 50%. Cedar Street is primarily densely-constructed single family and
multifamily residential properties, with the section between Waverly Street and Claflin Street having mixed
residential and commercial/industrial use. Cedar Street is located in south Framingham and in located in District 8. 
Unidirectional Flushing & Water Main Evaluation
The Cedar Street water main is included in Phase 2B of the City’s Water Distribution System Unidirectional Flushing
Program. Unidirectional flushing of Phase 2B was completed in the Fall of 2019. Flushing of Cedar Street was
completed in two parts, flowing north from the intersection of Cedar Street and Pine Street to a hydrant at the
intersection of Cedar Street and Waverly Street (hydrant 1784), then flowing south from the intersection of Cedar
Street and Pine Street to the first hydrant located on Cypress Street, after the intersection of Cedar and Cypress
Streets. 
Cedar Street was flushed from Pine Street to Waverly Street for thirty minutes, during which time the flow from
hydrant 1784 was recorded at 500 gallons per minute (gpm). The section of Cedar Street from Pine Street to Cypress
Street was also flushed for thirty minutes, and a flow rate from hydrant 1956 on Cypress Street was recorded at 300
gpm. Based on the American Water Works Association Manual M31, fire protection for one- and two-family
dwellings not to exceed two stories the required fire flow rate is as follows:

The City’s zoning district and observed building proximity would place the required flow rate for Cedar Street at
1,000 gpm, which is also the flow rate below which the Water Division provides notice of low flow water mains to the
Fire Department. At the time of unidirectional flushing, the Cedar Street water main north of Pine Street experienced
a fire flow deficit of 500 gpm, and south of Pine Street experienced a fire flow deficit of 700 gpm. The Water Division
notified the Fire Department of the flow deficiency on Cedar Street following completion of unidirectional flushing of
Phase 2B along with all other discovered deficiencies. Fire flow deficits have been discovered throughout the City and
have been evaluated under separate cover. 
Water Main Recommendations
The Cedar Street water main was identified as a water main that requires replacement in order to eliminate fire flow
deficits and restore domestic pressure and flow to ratepayers. We have been informed by the Highway Division that
Cedar Street is scheduled for necessary roadway improvements so work to repair the Cedar Street water main before
the roadway improvements begin is a priority. This water main replacement work is being scheduled in coordination
with roadway improvements and sewer lining on Cedar Street in order to minimize disturbances to the street
following completion of new paving. Due to the expeditious schedule and nature of the work, we recommend that
water main replacement work be completed by the Water Division’s on-call contractor. Replacement of this water
main shall include installation of a new 8-inch diameter cement-lined ductile iron water main, fittings, hydrants, 
valves, services, and appurtenances. We have prepared the following estimated cost for construction using the
Water Division’s on-call contractor as follows.

It should be noted that the Cedar Street water main is identified in the City’s 2017 Water System Master Plan as a
recommended improvement in year eight of the plan, or 2026. Including the Cedar Street water main in the
Department’scapital appropriation request for Cedar Street improvements in fiscal year 2023 will allow this
improvement to occur on schedule, address the recently-discovered fire flow deficit, and complete this work before
the scheduled roadway improvements. 
Elimination of cast-iron water mains that are over 100 years old from the water distribution system is a priority of the
Water Division. In addition to having restricted flow and pressure, in general, aged cast-iron water mains are prone
to breaks and requires emergency repairs more frequently. Performing repair work on active water mains in the
distribution system can be a significant challenge for Water Division staff and can frequently lead to extended
disruptions to the water service of our customers. Elimination of water mains that are well beyond their design life is
both prudent and necessary to avoid major infrastructure failures, avoid costly disruptions to our customers, and
provide adequate fire protection for property-owners and residents of the City. 
Closed Caption Television (CCTV) Inspection & Sewer Main Evaluation
In advance of the anticipated roadway work, the Sewer Division performed CCTV inspection of the sewer main and
manholes located on Cedar Street. The Sewer Division cleaned and inspected each section of sewer main and each
manhole to evaluate condition. It was determined that the unlined sections of the Cedar Street sewer main and
associated manholes do not contain major failures, misalignments, or evidence of size constraints of concern. 
Sewer Main Recommendations
While the age of the Cedar Street sewer main is advanced, the condition of the mains and manholes is favorable for
Cured-in-Place-Pipe (CIPP) lining and manhole sealing in lieu of sewer replacement. CIPP lining is also preferred
because there is an existing natural gas main located above the sewer main in the street. Excavation of this sewer
would resultantly be challenging and not advised until which time as the sewer main is determined to have capacity
concerns or is failing. 
As with aged water mains, deferring work on a sewer main of this age and material is not recommended. Vitrified
clay sewer mains of advanced age are known areas of infiltration and inflow, and require more frequent repairs. CIPP
lining and manhole sealing can extend the life of the sewer collection system on Cedar Street and prevent untimely
excavation of the newly-paved roadways for sewer repair work.

DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS | OPERATIONS
We recommend that sewer main replacement work be completed by the Sewer Division’s CIPP lining contractor. The
proposed work shall include CIPP lining of six 8-inch diameter sections (1,350 linear feet) of sewer main on Cedar
Street and one connecting section at the intersection of Pine and Cedar Streets, cutting out 35 sewer laterals, and
sealing five manholes totaling 43 linear feet of manhole sealing. We have prepared the following estimated cost for
construction using the Sewer Division’s CIPP lining contractor as follows.

Merriam Hill and Goodnow Water Tank Rehabilitation $300,000 Water Enterprise Fund
Water Department
Repair of Merriam Hill and Goodnow Water Storage Tank necessary to maintain
structural integrity of tanks and promote and maintain good drinking water quality
Partial recommendation for $300,000 of the $2,430,000 requested to begin the tank
rehabilitation project. 
The Merriam Hill and Goodnow Water Storage Tanks were recently inspected in 2020. 
The Merriam Hill Water Storage Tank was constructed in 1962. It is a welded steel
structure and has the capacity to store 3.5 million gallons of potable water. The work
that has been identified to rehabilitate the Merriam Hill Tank and extend its service life
includes taking the tank out of service, cleaning, welding repairs, installing mixing
system, replacement of the interior and exterior coatings, and disinfection. The existing
coating is lead based and will require full containment for sand blasting and removal. 
The Goodnow Tank was constructed in 1976. It is a Corten steel structure, a steel that
naturally forms a protective rust layer, and requires no painting. The Goodnow Tank is a
legged elevated tank with the capacity of 300,000 gallons of potable water. The work
identified to repair the Goodnow Tank and maintain it in good working order includes
taking the tank out of service, cleaning, spot-repair of interior metal corrosion, minor
structural roof repairs, and disinfection. 
The recent inspections in 2020 were completed while the tanks were in service with the
use of submersible cameras. As such, additional work may be identified once the tanks
are out of service and workers are able to enter the space. In general, repair of the
Merriam Hill and Goodnow Tanks are necessary maintain the structural integrity of the
tanks and promote main good drinking water quality. 
The inspection of the Merriam Hill Tank concluded that the tank is in generally good
structural condition. It is evident when comparing the 2020 inspection to the most recent
prior inspection (2015) that the corrosion of the Merriam Hill Tank is continuing to
advance. The tank has been in service for nearly 60 years, and the expected life cycle
for welded steel tanks is 50-70 years. Taking action to rehabilitate this tank now will
extend the life of the tank at least another 20 years. Coating failures on the interior and
exterior of the Merriam Hill Tank are contributing to metal loss, and on some surfaces
medium to heavy corrosion is evident. Over time this corrosion will continue to degrade
the structural integrity of the tank. In order to rehabilitate the current tank and avoid a
full tank replacement, the work required includes taking the tank out of service, 
cleaning, welding repairs, installing mixing system, replacement of the interior and
exterior coatings, and disinfection. An active mixer is proposed to be installed to reduce
icing in winter and tank stratification in summer. Timely action to rehabilitate the 
401

Merriam Hill tank will stave off the need a full tank replacement, which has more
associated risk and cost. 
The 2020 online inspection of the Goodnow Tank concluded that the tank is in good
structural condition. The tank is constructed of Corten steel - also known as weathered
steel - which naturally oxidizes to form a protective rust patina, and does not require
painting. The inspection concluded that the steel surface on the interior and exterior of
the tank were generally in good condition. Spot repairs of corroded surfaces on the tank
interior and minor exterior structural repairs are recommended. The work to repair the
Goodnow Tank includes taking the tank out of service, cleaning, spot-repair of interior
metal corrosion, minor structural roof repairs, and disinfection. The Goodnow Tank has
been in service for 45 years. Over time, corrosion will result in metal loss, and impaired
structural integrity of the tank if left untreated. Performing the repair work to the
Goodnow tank will prevent further metal loss. The work associated with the Goodnow
Tank is complicated by the height of the tank, with an overflow elevation nearly 440 feet
above grade.

Subject: Recommendation for
Tank Rehabilitation Budgets
Dear Ms. Tarves: 
This is a recommendation for rehabilitation of the Merriam Hill and Goodnow tanks. We have reviewed
the two inspections reports and offer the following. 
Background
The Merriam Hill and Goodnow Water Storage Tanks were recently inspected in 2020. The Merriam Hill
Water Storage Tank was constructed in 1962. It is a welded steel structure and has the capacity to store
3.5 million gallons of potable water. Work has been identified to rehabilitate the Merriam Hill Tank and
extend its service life by taking the tank out of service, cleaning, welding repairs, installing mixing
system, replacing interior and exterior coatings, and disinfecting. The existing coating is lead-based and
will require full containment for sand blasting and removal. 
The Goodnow Tank was constructed in 1976. It is a Corten steel structure, a steel that naturally forms a
protective rust layer, and requires no painting. The Goodnow Tank is a legged elevated tank with the
capacity of 300,000 gallons of potable water. Work identified to rehabilitate the Goodnow Tank and
maintain it includes taking the tank out of service, cleaning, spot-repair of interior metal corrosion, 
minor structural roof repairs, and disinfecting. 
Justification
The most recent tank inspections in 2020 were completed while the tanks were in service with the use
of submersible cameras. As such, additional work may be identified once the tanks are out of service
and workers are able to enter the space. In general, repairs of the Merriam Hill and Goodnow Tanks are
necessary to maintain the structural integrity of each tank and to promote good drinking water quality. 
The inspection of the Merriam Hill Tank concluded that the tank is in generally good structural
condition. It is evident when comparing the 2020 inspection to the most recent prior inspection (2015) 
that the corrosion of the Merriam Hill Tank is continuing to advance. The tank has been in service for
nearly 60 years, and the expected life cycle for welded steel tanks is SO-70 years. Taking action to
rehabilitate this tank now will extend the life of the tank at least another 20 years. Coating failures on
the interior and exterior of the Merriam Hill Tank are contributing to metal loss, and on some surfaces
medium to heavy corrosion is evident. Over time this corrosion will continue to degrade the structural
integrity of the tank. To rehabilitate the current tank and avoid a full tank replacement, the work noted

above needs to be conducted. An active mixer is proposed to be installed to reduce icing in winter and
tank stratification in summer. Timely action to rehabilitate the Merriam Hill tank will stave off the need
a full tank replacement, which has more associated risk and cost. 
The 2020 inspection of the Goodnow Tank concluded that the tank is in good structural condition. The
tank is constructed of Corten steel -also known as weathered steel -which naturally oxidizes to form a
protective rust patina that does not require painting. The inspection concluded that the steel surface on
the interior and exterior of the tank were generally in good condition. Spot repairs of corroded surfaces
on the tank interior and minor exterior structural repairs were recommended. Work to repair the
Goodnow Tank was noted above. The Goodnow Tank has been in service for 45 years. Over time, 
corrosion will result in metal loss, and impaired structural integrity of the tank if left untreated. 
Performing the repair work to the Goodnow tank will prevent further metal loss. The work associated
with the Goodnow Tank is complicated by the height of the tank, with an overflow elevation nearly 440
feet above grade. 
The Merriam Hill Tank is one of the last to be rehabilitated or replaced, and the Goodnow Tank has had
needed repairs identified in 2009, yet to be completed. Investing now into the preservation of these
tanks is prudent, particularly in the case of the Merriam Hill Tank, because the repairs proposed are vital
to extending the service life of the tanks and avoiding complete tank replacement that could cost the
City upwards of $10M. A complete tank replacement of the Merriam Hill Tank and repair of the
Goodnow Tank were both identified in the City's 2017 Water Master Plan, recommended between 2020
and 2022. The estimated cost associated with replacement of the Merriam Hill Tank in the Master Plan
was $14M. Rehabilitation of the Merriam Hill Tank now realizes cost savings to the City of over $10M. 
Recommendation
Based on our review of the inspection reports, we offer the following detailed recommendation for each
tank: 
Merriam Hill Tank
We recommend that the finishes be abrasive blast cleaned to SP-6 on the exterior and SP-10 on the
interior. Pit and linear weld repairs. Coating for the exterior consists of 4 (four) coats of
Zinc/Epoxy/Flouropolymer (Tnemec Series 700) using Class 1A lead containment and the interior
consists of 1(one) coat of Zinc/Epoxy VOC free. 
Recommendations were made regarding safety, sanitary, security, and structure by Suez. We agree
with the recommendations. 
A question was raised as to our opinion regarding rehabilitation vs. replacement of the tank. The
existing tank is structurally sound with no major issues at the foundation level of the tank. Further
metal loss is not significant enough to justify complete demolition and replacement of the tank; 
therefore, our opinion would be for the City to rehabilitate the tank rather than replace. 
Goodnow Tank
The Goodnow tank is constructed of Corten steel, which provides a natural layer of protection via a
uniform layer of rust. Based on the results of the inspection, that layer is generally in good shape on
both the interior and exterior surfaces. There were some observed areas where corrosion was noted on
X00

the interior surface. These locations should be spot treated to SP-11 and coated with an Epoxy 100% 
solids by brush or drywall knife. 
Recommendations were made regarding safety, sanitary, security, and structure by Suez. We agree
with the recommendations. 
Rehabilitation Costs
To provide a complete cost for the rehabilitation of both tanks; design, bidding, etc. should be included
in your budget. We would recommend the following: 
Design
Bidding
Construction Administration
Construction Oversight
Construction
Construction Contingency 
$40,000
$5,000
$40,000
$100,000 (Subcontractor) 
$2,100,000 ($1.7m Merriam Hill; $0.4m Goodnow) 
$145,000
Total Budget Recommendation $2,430,000
Tank Maintenance
A maintenance proposal was prepared for the City by a third-party vendor that included recommended
maintenance costs to be performed by the third-party vendor. We have reviewed the proposal and
have prepared under separate cover a recommendation for the City regarding entering into athird-party
tank maintenance program versus performing in-house tank maintenance with contracting specific tasks
outside the City's ability or expertise. We recommend the City continue performing in-house
maintenance, using a contractor as needed for necessary tasks outside the City's capability to perform. 
We recommend the City consider budgeting separate funds for annual maintenance of all City-owned
tanks. Comparable communities of your size and number of tanks spend around $30,000 on average
per year on tank maintenance activities. In reviewing your recent inspection reports from 2020 for all
tanks, we recommend the City budget $35,000 annually to continue to effectively maintain all the City's
tanks plus $20,000 - $30,000 for known needed repairs. It should be noted, tanks of advanced age (at or
beyond their design life) will require more costly repairs and may require greater maintenance, repair, 
and rehabilitation costs beyond the estimate provided. 
Please let me know if you need any further information on tank rehabilitation. 
Very truly yours,

SUMMARY 
The overall structural and sanitary condition of the subject tank is still remains in very good
condition with no significant progression in degradation since our last inspection of 2015. The
only immediate concerns are the (2) areas of leaks located within the outer roof knuckle as
further detailed within the “Structural” section below as well as the attached report. 
The exposed Corten steel along the exterior surfaces of the tank is still maintaining a uniform
protective layer of rust which has prohibited any noticeable progression in corrosive activity
or furtherance in metal loss of the referenced surfaces. In addition, the painted components
along the exterior of the tank such as the sway rods, radial rods, anchor bolts and overflow
assembly were also noted to be in generally the same condition as reported during the 2015
inspection. The coatings along these surfaces remain very good condition with no evidence
of any significant progression in the degradation of the referenced coatings observed from
either the supporting structure access ladder or from the ground. Even the previously
reported corrosive activity along the backside of several leg column anchor bolts has not
significantly progressed since our last inspection. 
The coatings along the visible interior surfaces of the tank were also found to still be in
generally very good condition with at least 98% of the coatings still intact and providing sound
protection to the underlying steel substrate. The remaining surfaces along the underside of
the roof, knuckle, shell interior surfaces as well as the visible surfaces of the upper bowl
appeared to be exhibiting a slight progression in the overall extent and severity of corrosive
currently taking place. There appears to be a slight increase in medium to heavy rusting
along the roof support structure as well as an increase in rust tubercle formations along the
painter’s angle/stiffener and shell surfaces immediately adjacent to the angle. As previously
reported, there is also evidence of at least slight metal loss along areas of some of the rust
tubercles however no significant progression in metal loss was noted. The existing coatings
still appear to exhibiting sound adhesion to the substrate with no evidence of blistering or
other signs of degradation other than the slight progression in overall extent of degradation

noted above. Therefore, the opportunity to perform spot maintenance to the referenced
surfaces in order to prohibit any further metal loss and extend the serviceable life of the
existing coatings still appears to exist. However, be advised that a comprehensive
assessment of the lower bowl surfaces as well as the interior of the riser has not been
performed due to the presence of sediment masking the bowl surfaces as well as the limited
access to the riser. If the interior surfaces are to be spot maintained provisions for removal of
all sediment and re-assessment of both the bowl and riser interior in order to assess
prevailing conditions along these surfaces should be included in the scope of work
performed. This would allow for possible modifications as to the scope of work required to
properly rehabilitate the interior surfaces in question. 
INTERIOR COATING RECOMMENDATIONS 
If spot maintenance is to be performed along the interior surfaces of the tank, particularly the
painter’s angle/stiffener and immediately adjacent surfaces, then the following scope of work
should be considered. All areas of failure to the substrate and/or corrosion should be power
tool cleaned in accordance with SSPC-SP #11 Power Tool Cleaning to Bare Metal with
Profile standards. The peripheral areas surrounding the spot cleaned areas should be
feathered back at least ½” to ensure a smooth transition to tight existing coating and proper
profiling to ensure good interfacial adhesion. All areas cleaned to bare metal loss should then
receive (1) coat of an NSF approved 100% solids epoxy coating applied by brush or drywall
knife to a minimum of 25-30 mils or in accordance with manufactures recommendations. 
STRUCTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS 
The overall structural integrity of the subject tank appears to be in excellent condition, 
however, there are (2) small penetrations within the roof knuckle which are currently plugged
with what appears to be self-tapping screws and gaskets but the gasket is leaking. The leaks
should be re-sealed as soon as possible. If the repairs outlined above are to be performed
consideration should be given to permanently sealing these leaks by spot welding both
interior and exterior faces then cleaning and painting the interior faces as outlined above. If a
welding repair is not performed, then at a minimum, the leaks should be temporarily re-
sealed with at least new tapping plugs and gaskets. 
SANITARY RECOMMENDATIONS 
As previously stated, the overall sanitary condition of the subject tank appears to be very
good with no remedial repairs or modifications required at this time. 
SAFETY & SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS 
The safety and security of the tank is also in very good condition with no remedial work or
improvements required.

SUMMARY 
Due to the extensive coating failure taking place along the exterior roof surfaces, as well as
the extent and the aggressive nature of the corrosive activity taking place along the interior
shell surfaces, consideration should be given to scheduling the tank for complete
rehabilitation as soon as feasible to do so. At that time, it is recommended that the scope of
work outlined below be performed as a minimum consideration. 
EXTERIOR COATING RECOMMENDATIONS 
Due to age of the existing coating systems, the extensive coating degradation along the
exterior roof surfaces and evidence of interfacial adhesion problems along the shell surfaces
it is recommended that exterior surfaces of the tank, inclusive of all appurtenances, be
abrasive blast cleaned to a SSPC-SP #6 Commercial blast grade followed by the application
of a (4) coat Zinc/Epoxy/Urethane coating system which consists of (2) finish coats of an
Acrylic polyurethane material. Laboratory analysis of the coatings has indicated that there are
actionable levels of lead and chromium present within the exterior coatings therefore it will be
necessary to completely encapsulate localized areas of the tank, if not the entire tank
structure, within a class 1A containment structure during the abrasive blast cleaning
operations so as not to adversely impact or contaminate the surrounding area or grounds. 
This containment structure should conform to the guidelines set forth within SSPC-Guide 6
(Guide for Containing Surface preparation Debris during Paint Removal Operations) with
strict limits on emissions. Both pre and post soil sampling should be performed around the
perimeter of the tank in order to determine existing, as well as, post maintenance soil
conditions and air quality monitoring should be performed during the abrasive blast cleaning
phase of the tank rehabilitation to ensure there is no impact to the surrounding community.

INTERIOR COATING RECOMMENDATIONS 
Due to the extent of blistering, delamination and complete failure to the substrate it is
recommended that all interior surfaces, inclusive but not limited to, the roof, roof supporting
structure, shell, and floor be completely abrasive blast cleaned to an SSPC-SP #10 Near-
White Metal grade. The underside of the roof plates as well as the roof support structure
should then receive (1) full coat of a NSF approved Zinc Primer applied at 2.5-3.5 mils, (1) 
stripe coat of a NSF approved high solids Epoxy applied at 4.0-6.0 mils to all lap seams
angles and bolted connections followed by (2) full coats of the same Epoxy material applied
at 3.0-5.0 mils per coat for a minimum DFT of 12.0 mils for the completed system. The shell
and floor surfaces should receive (1) full coat of a NSF approved Zinc Primer applied at 2.5- 
3.5 mils, (1) stripe coat of a NSF approved high solids Epoxy applied at 4.0-6.0 mils to all
weld seams angles and/or bolted connections followed by (1) coat of an NSF approved 100% 
solids Epoxy coating applied at 25-30 mils. 
STRUCTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS 
The overall structural integrity of the subject tank still appears to be good however the
aggressive nature of the corrosive activity along the shell surfaces would suggest the
possibility of active metal loss in the form of pitting and/or loss of weldment both of which
may require remedial repairs. It is therefore strongly recommended that provisions for
welding repairs, such as linear welding and pit welding and/or plating, be incorporated within
the scope of work to be performed. It is recommended that all areas of metal loss in the form
of pitting representing a 35% or greater reduction in corresponding plate thickness along both
the shell and floor surfaces be spot welded in such a manner so as to ensure 100% fusion
with the base metal and bring the pit at least flush with the original plate surface. For the
purpose of establishing base line costs it is recommended that a quantity of (500) pits be
included in the scope of work to be performed, along with a unit cost per pit to be added or
subtracted from the lump sum number based on the final count. There is also localized areas
of heavy corrosion and stratified rust formations along the roof lap seams, the junctions with
the roof rafters, as well as rafter connections to shell support clips which represent the areas
with the greatest possibility of actionable metal loss to be present. Therefore provisions for
linear welding and patch plates should also be included in the project specifications in order
to address these potential issues as well. The shell is equipped with a single 18” x 24” oval
shell manhole. At such time as the subject tank is scheduled for complete rehabilitation
consideration should be given to installing a minimum of (1) additional shell manhole in order
to aid in compliance with current OSHA Confined Space Regulations. It is recommended that
this shell manhole be 30” in diameter and be equipped with a hinged or davit supported
cover. 
SANITARY RECOMMENDATIONS 
The roof is equipped with (82) 2” diameter rigging couplings of which are currently sealed. 
However, any and all rigging couplings which are found to be deteriorated and/or damaged to
the degree in which they will not properly seal should be replaced as necessary prior to the
completion of all scheduled cleaning and painting.

SAFETY & SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS 
The existing ladder gate offers very little protection against unauthorized access to the roof
due to the close proximity of the ladder to grade and the large spacing between the vertical
slats of the ladder cage. It is therefore recommended that the ladder be cut off at a higher
elevation and the existing ladder gate re-installed, or at least the bottom (2) sections of ladder
cage be removed so as to allow for the installation of a new hinged ladder gate which
completely encapsulates at least the bottom 8’ of the access ladder and is capable of being
locked in place. In addition, consideration should be given to replacing the existing fall
prevention device on the ladder with a flexible cable system.

The coatings along the exterior surfaces of the roof are in poor condition with
severe weathering and extensive degradation resulting in widespread thinning, 
crazed cracking and coating delamination exposing several difference coating

the roof surfaces are also experiencing complete delamination resulting in the
exposure of the steel substrate and medium to heavy surface rusting. This
degradation represents only a slight progression since 2015

The coatings along the shell surfaces are still providing an acceptable level of

inclusive of previously spot cleaned and re-coated surfaces are exhibiting
significant surface degradation and evidence of compromised inter-facial
adhesion as indicated by scattered areas of top coat delamination. In addition, 
adhesion testing revealed weak adhesion at different interfaces suggesting that
these surfaces no longer provide a suitable substrate for additional spot
maintenance and overcoating.

The top shell ring is equipped with a painter's rail which also appears intact and
structurally sound at least as viewed from the ground and the shell ladder. As
previously reported during our past inspection, the rail is equipped with (2) 
rigging trolleys which appear intact however, functionality and safety is highly
questionable therefore, the angle as well as trolleys should be closely inspected
prior to use.
The concrete foundation was still found to be structurally sound with no      
appreciable degradation evident. The mastic sealer between the foundation and
floor plate however is exhibiting significant degradation and/or is completely
missing. At such time as the exterior surfaces of the subject tank are next
maintained the existing mastic sealer should be completely removed and
replaced with an elastomeric sealant
The bottom shell ring is equipped with (1) 18" x 24" oval manhole with a      
reinforcement pad. The manhole assembly appears structurally sound and in
good sanitary condition however,the hinge assembly which originally supported
the cover when in the open position has been removed.

The shell access ladder assembly is intact and structurally sound however, the
     
coating is in only fair condition with evidence of scattered medium to heavy
rusting taking place primarily along bolted connections of the cage and ladder
support brackets. The ladder is equipped with what appears to be a
non-conventional fall prevention system consisting of a galvanized flat bar
material bolted to the ladder rungs. The manufacturer of this system is unknown

The coatings along the underside of the roof are in generally good condition      
with 90% of the coatings still intact. The remaining surfaces are exhibiting
scattered areas of medium to heavy rust and stratified rust formations along lap
seams and unsealed junctions with roof supporting structure as well as the roof
to shell junction. There also appears to be a significant degree of corrosion
along the top face of the bottom rafter flanges and connections with the shell.
The overall structural integrity of the roof plates and roof support structure still      
appears to be good however, evidence of at least localized areas of heavy
stratified rust formations along areas noted above suggest the strong probability
that at least slight to moderate metal loss may be taking place along the
affected surfaces. The potential for metal loss was noted during our last
inspection and it appears to have at least noticeably progressed since that
inspection

Coatings along the shell interior are exhibiting scattered areas of failure      
resulting is medium to heavy rust and rust tubercle formations occurring along
weld seams and main plate surfaces mostly within the bottom (5) shell rings.
The shell interior surfaces appear to be in good structural condition however,       
there is potential for scattered areas of at least slight to moderate metal loss as
well as at least isolated areas of significant metal loss all primarily in the form of
pitting along both main plate surfaces and weld seams as shown in attached
photographs. 
The floor surfaces were covered in less than 2" of sediment which impeded
detailed visual inspection of these surfaces however, our last inspection of 2015
did reveal what appeared to be rust tubercles protruding up through the silt at
that time. This would suggest the probability of active corrosion and potential
metal loss along the floor surfaces as well.
