The Honorable City Council
150 Concord Street
Framingham, MA 01702
Dear Councilors,
am pleased to present the first Capital Improvement Plan for the City of Framingham.
It is important to invest in the City's valuable capital assets. It is vital that we maintain the water mains (pipes)
that convey our drinking water to residents in all corners of our community. It is essential that we repair roads
and bridges that transport our citizens to school, work or play; maintain parks, fields and recreation facilities
for robust quality of life; and maintain, repair or replace necessary equipment to fight fires, rescue citizens and
clean the city. It is our responsibility to repair, maintain and replace the buildings and other facilities where we
teach our children, provide services to seniors, veterans, businesses, and residents, and conduct the business
of governing.
The City has an enormous task to manage an incredible number of assets. Framingham has 225 miles of
roadway and 210 miles of sidewalk, numbers some of you have heard before or read in capital budget
documents. We also maintain 50 signaled intersections throughout the City. There is 265 miles of water main
and 231 miles of sewer main running under our roads, fields, rivers and ponds; some as old as the 1800s. We
have 43 sewer pump stations (more than the City of Boston) and seven water pump stations. There are seven
water tanks across Framingham. We own and are responsible for 30 bridges. Framingham has approximately
200 miles of storm water main; over 20% of which is over 75 years old. We have approximately 238 culverts -
107 of which are identified.
Framingham has some amazing places to play and relax! The City has 36 parks, including three City beaches.
There are 21 recreation areas that are water/conservation related including a Community Garden and boat
ramps for public use. The are 25 sports field locations that house 52 various fields for spring sports (baseball,
softball, lacrosse, soccer, track and field) and 36 fields for fall sports (football, field hockey, soccer and cross
country), plus 9 School athletic fields for Framingham team sports. There a 20 fully equipped playgrounds for
our kids located all across the City. There is currently 6.35 miles of aqueduct trails in Framingham. Finally we
have our own ice rink (Loring Arena) and a newly renovated athletic stadium/complex, Bowditch Field.
Our City facilities and buildings are varied and used for multiple community purposes, not just for their "official
function".There are 14 School buildings and 18 municipal buildings —including five fire stations, two libraries,
and five important historic buildings that require significant repair. We also have 13 Park/Recreation buildings
and shade shelters to maintain. There are 70 unique sites in our beautification program that need to be
maintained.
Page 2
To do all this work, our departments (city-wide) have multiple pieces of equipment ranging from large dump
trucks, fire engines and ladder trucks, snow plows and sanders, tractors and landscape trailers and equipment;
sidewalk plows, tank trucks (both landscaping and fire suppression). We have roll-off trailers for sanitation and
recycling collection, trash packers and Zambonis, bobcats and large mowers and animal transport vehicles.
There are more than 300 pieces of rolling and non-rolling equipment used to maintain our great places and
provide services to our community.
There is a demonstrated link between infrastructure maintenance and investment and economic
development. Planned sewer repair and upgrades were coordinated with Tech Park tenants which provided a
context for Framingham to receive a state Jobs Grant for sewer design and a $12.4 million Life Sciences Grant
to offset the City's cost to upgrade and expand the capacity of that infrastructure. The result has been
business expansion in Technology Park, increased industrial value and additional tax revenue at the
commercial rate.
What is proposed in this plan is the essential capital asset maintenance needs of City Departments for the
current construction season. We ask the City Council to authorize the requests for FY19 only. There are
necessary projects to be managed by the School Department and our Roadway Management Plan that are a
priority for this construction season. Many of these projects and purchases have been deferred from prior
fiscal years. The Capital Improvement Plan is subject to the referendum provision in the Charter, so projects
may not begin until the 30 referendum period is over.
This plan identifies future capital needs both by Department and by asset type. It includes improvements to
infrastructure, equipment and facilities. But this new City has some important decisions to make about our
municipal buildings; both schools and operational centers. Decisions that were put on hold as required by the
Charter must now be re-evaluated and incorporated into the FY2020 Capital Improvement Plan. We ask, and
welcome, the citizens of Framingham to participate in those decisions.
Information included in the package provides the framework for the capital investment decisions in our
immediate future and through FY2024. The choices are difficult; we must balance the upkeep of our
equipment, infrastructure and buildings with our capacity to finance that cost and our ability to manage the
work successfully. Both the Executive and Legislative branches have a fiduciary and custodial responsibility to
manage and authorize capital investment. I am excited to present you with our first Capital Improvement Plan
and I  look forward to working with you on this important endeavor!
Sincerely
~~~- ~.

Executive Summary
The focus of this Capital Improvement Plan is on the immediate capital maintenance of assets. Given the
abbreviated review period and extended authorization timeline —the Capital Improvement Plan is subject to
the referendum process —our recommendation is to request the funding for $10.5 million in General Fund
capital improvements for FY19. This plan is to be financed via both bonds of $7.5 million and Free Cash
appropriation of $3 million. The total Capital Improvement Plan for the General Fund was $25.6 million. We
are recommending deferring $4.6 million in capital requests to FY20, including two pieces of fire apparatus for
Station 2. As the new Fire Station 2 is just beginning the construction phase, the new apparatus should be
planned to fit and operate in the new facility. The remaining requests to be included in the Plan -$10.3 million
is recommended to be deferred to FY20 or later. Those capital needs will be redistributed through the out-
years of the plans by their respective Departments.
The Capital Improvement Plan for the Utility Enterprise Fund totals $16.5 million for FY19; $15.2 million to be
financed by bonds, MWRA grants and interest free loans, and $1.3 million by retained earnings. The remaining
requests for the Plan, totaling $3.9 million, is deferred. These projects and assets will be redistributed through
the future years of the Capital Improvement Plan. A number of the water and sewer improvement projects
included here are annual efforts at smaller improvements and repairs. You will find that the projects are
paired —water and sewer—combined to put both utilities in the ground at the same time and coordinate the
road restoration, sidewalk and curbing projects as a comprehensive solution. This is true with the one large
project: Worcester Road (Route 9), both water and sewer lines from Concord Street east to the Natick line.
The Worcester Road project will be partially funded with MWRA grant and loan program, reducing the debt
service incurred by traditional bond financing.

Over the longer range the capital needs of the City look daunting, amounting to $402.8 million. This does not
include the first five years of the Municipal Building Plan (previously referred to as the Major Building Projects
Plan) which adds another $162 million (estimated). More detail is included in other sections of this document.

Capital Improvement Plan: FY2020 to FY2024
The Capital Improvement Plan also forecasts the capital investment needs for both the General Fund Capital
Plan and the Utility Enterprise Fund Capital Plan for the next five years. The cost of the needed investment
exceeds the financial and managerial capability of the City. This is not a new issue; nor is it unique to
Framingham. Every municipality in Massachusetts and beyond struggles with maintaining it capital
infrastructure, facilities and equipment. For the last 13 years Framingham capital investment has been
discussed in public meetings, Board of Selectmen Meeting, Finance Committee meetings, Capital Budget
Committee meetings and on the floor of Town Meeting. We keep track of the overall capital investment need,
we prioritize our most important investments, making smart and effective decisions along the way. Despite
the challenges we will not give up.
The Framingham Public Works Division has developed and updated a roadway master plan, a stormwater
master plan, a water and wastewater master plan. The Parks Department developed a Cushing Park Master
Plan (the called Tercentennial Park) and a Master Plan for Bowditch Field. We had the data that told us how
much needed to be done. But in one important area the state dictated how and when we had to improve. In
2006, the state embarked on a review of our water and sewer systems, specifically sewer system inflows —
cleanwater leaking into the sewer system and flowing into the MWRA treatment center. 
pg. 6
Page 7
The DEP imposed an Administrative Consent Order(ACO) which required Framingham to perform over $160
million in sewer system and water system improvements in a five year period which began in 2007. The state
did provide access to low cost loans(2% interest rate) for eligible project costs and allocated approximately
$12 million in American Recovery Act dollars in FY2010/11. The aggressive implementation of the ACO by
Framingham meant we were able to avoid the enormous fines that had been levied on other communities for
similar water and sewer system failures ($80 million for North Andover, although by the time they actually
paid it, it had been negotiated down to $10-$12 million).
The Roadway Management Plan in 2006 stated we needed to invest $5 million per year to Keep the roadways
in good condition. We started in 2007 with $450,000, less than 10% of the minimum investment. Since 2010,
we have allocated at least $3 million and as high as $4.5 million. The updated edition of the Roadway
Management Plan now recommends $7.5 million per year to make up for the years we did not invest enough.
We continue to male progress toward that plan even if we cannot get it all done.
The graph below illustrates the capital needs broken down into asset groupings: Infrastructure, Equipment and
Facilities/Buildings. Note that Facilities/Buildings does NOT include the Long Range Capital Plan for municipal
buildings. There is more detail on the plan further along in this document —two building renovations in the
initial five years of the plan have been authorized already —Fire Station 2 and Village Hall —and Fuller School is
far along in the process. But significant decisions need to be made regarding the Memorial Building, the
Danforth Building, the Western Ave DPW facility and the Pearl Street garage. The two peaks in the graph in
FY20 and FY23 are two major school renovations —this is another portion of the Capital Improvement Plan
which needs review to address the timing of these projects in light of the length of the process to get MSBA
funding.

A Community-wide View: Facilities/Buildings
Prior to the passage of the Charter, the Framingham administration undertook a review of all the municipal-
owned buildings, including Schools. The School Department had developed a database that recorded all
building operating assets and the replacement or repair schedule for each building. The "Town's" Facilities
Management Department used that tool to record the same data for all municipal buildings. This analysis
revealed substantial building envelope, life safety, code compliance and major system deficiencies throughout
our municipal buildings. 
Municipal Government Buildings (19)
The following buildings were evaluated in detail:
• Municipal Use (4)
— Memorial Building
— Main Public Library
— Callahan Senior Center
— McAuliffe Branch Library
• Special Use (2)
— Danforth Building
— Maynard Building (prior
to sale)
— Pearl St Garage 
• Cultural Historical (5)
— Cushing Chapel
— Old Edgell Library
— Academy Building
— Village Hall
— Athenaeum Hall
• Public Safety (7)
— Police Headquarters
— Animal Control
— Fire Stations (5)
From this combined database the Long Range Building Plan was created. The plan determined that two fire
stations needed to be replaced and major renovations performed on two additional fire stations. Repairs,
renovations, life safety and code compliance are needed at Police Headquarters, Callahan Senior Center, the
p~. 9
Page 10
Main Library, etc. Cultural Buildings are in need of significant improvements. Finally, the Memorial Building
requires extensive and costly renovations.
The Memorial Building is structurally sound and in fair condition. The systems in the Memorial Building are fair
to poor. Code compliance deficiencies include absence of a fire suppression system and Architectural Access
Board code shortfalls. The Memorial Building space study found that there is 75,900 square feet including
Nevins Hall and the Memorial. Only 49,510 square feet is available for office, meeting space, restrooms,
storage space and support services. Almost 63,000 square feet is needed, a short fall of 13,450 sf. This doesn't
include the 22,000 sf occupied by the School Administration leased in the Perini Building. Pricing from 2016
for Memorial Building repairs and upgrades plus and annex of some sort for the additional space was $24.1
million. The original recommendation was that a delay in acting on the Memorial Building created costs to the
building that needed to be done in the near term.
The larger Long Range Building Plan was broken down into management "chunks" by five year period.

• Fire Station #1—Design and Construct: $2.5 M
• Consolidate Dispatch Center to old Station 1$2.0 M
• Renovate Station #5 —Concord St.: $1.5 M
• Major School 2019:  $10.0 M
• Major School 2022:  $11,3 M
• Scheduled Building Plan Expenditures $7.3M

Three of the buildings included in this plan are moving forward: Fire Station 2 has been sited, designed and bid
for construction; Village Hall upgrades have been designed and bid for construction; Fuller School replacement
has been accepted into the MA School Building Authority funding cycle and is in the preliminary design phase.
The remaining buildings require a comprehensive review and policy choice by the newly elected leaders of the
City. The updated chart with these completed actions is below:

How do we finance the Capital Improvement Plan?
Generally, the plan is financed by issuing bonds and notes (borrowing),allocating free cash in the General
Fund, allocating retained earnings in the Enterprise Fund, state grants and loan programs, and MWRA grant
and loan programs.
• Bonds and notes (BANS): bonds are long term "permanent" loan vehicles that pays back principal and
interest costs for dollars borrowed to fund capital projects (similar to a home mortgage). Notes refers
to "bond anticipation notes (BANS)" which are short term borrowing instruments for which interest
only is paid (similar to a construction loan that will then convert to a mortgage). Once the short term
cash is spent, the obligation is paid by a formal bond. Generally we issue a short term borrow at the
end of May/middle of June to male sure we have enough cash in capital accounts for the end of the
fiscal year. These BANS are a six month term, through mid-December. In December, we issue both a
Page 12
bond offering and smaller BAN offering. The City employs a municipal investment advisor (Hilltop
Securities) who assists the Finance Division in preparing a bond and note package for the municipal
bond market (called the Official Statement; it is available to anyone who wants to read it). As part of
this process we solicit a credit rating from Moody's Credit Rating Agency. Our current rating is very
good at Aa2, just two steps down from the highest rating. Framingham has demonstrated excellent
access to the municipal bond market, even during the recession of 2008-2011. Our December
issuances have generated bids from at least five and as many as ten investors ranging from local banks
to top investment house like JP Morgan, Fidelity and Raymond James. Our recent market outings have
resulted in net interest costs of 2.6% to 2.9%for bonds and 50 to 97 basis points for BANS.
• Free Cash and Retained Earnings: Free cash is the unobligated end of year balance in the General Fund.
Retained earnings is the same in the Enterprise Fund. Framingham has used free cash for a handful of
capital projects in the last few years. Since FY15 we have been focusing on depositing large the
majority portion of free cash into the Capital Stabilization Fund in anticipation of the Fuller School
project and the renovation of the Memorial Building—the two largest building projects in our
immediate future. In the FY19 capital budget we allocated $3 million in free cash to the Capital
Improvement Plan; specifically $990,000 to School projects and $2.01 million in the remaining General
Fund plan. The Utility Enterprise Fund Plan invests $1.297 million of retained earnings in the FY19
year of the Capital Improvement Plan. The Recommended Capital Plan lists at the beginning of this
document indicates the finance method for each project.
• State grant and loan programs. The Water and Sewer (Wastewater) Department projects have access
to MWRA grant and 0% interest loan programs. The MWRA allocates a grant amount and loan
amount each year (referred to as a phase). DPW then assigns the funds to specific projects. For the
grants, it's the same as cash. The Treasurer's Office coordinates the cash and loan program funds with
DPW and the MWRA. We also have access to the State Revolving Fund low interest loan program. The
state Dept. of Environmental Protection manages the federal funds from the Clean Water Act and the
Drinking Water Act as a 2%interest rate loan program for municipalities. Framingham financed the
$40 million East Framingham Sewer Improvement Project (EFSIP) through this program. During
FY2010 the federal ARRA program distributed federal infrastructure assistance through this program —
Framingham applied for and received $8 million in loan forgiveness (aka cash for the project) for the
EFSIP project and $4 million for other sewer projects.
Debt Service and the Impact on the Operating Budgets
Debt service is the amount of money needed on a periodic basis to pay back monies borrowed by the City to
fund capital projects. In the case of Framingham, that periodic basis is a year. Our borrowing schedule has
been a small short term borrow in June for the construction season and a larger bond issue in December. We
do not bond in advance of project expenditures. Municipalities are heavily regulated when it comes to
borrowing. We cannot hold onto bond proceeds to make money. A significant portion of bond proceeds must
be spent within 18 months and almost all within two years. Cities and Town pay a penalty (equal to the
interest or return you made on the funds) if it holds on to bond proceeds for too long. Therefore Framingham
borrows what has been expended similar to a reimbursement grant. The current bond issue also allows us to
budget timely for debt service since we are determining that amount prior to the crafting of the next year
budget.
Framingham has a financial policy that limits how much of the operating budget can be allocated for annual
debt service. That limit is 5%a which is the existing MA Department of Revenue best practice. The chart below
pg. 12
Page 13
provide information on the estimated debt service that would be incurred when borrowing for the Capital
Improvement Plan as requested. To be sure, this is a planning document, a forecast of what our needs are and
an indication of how severely we need to plan/manage capital investment. As explained in previous sections
of this document, we do not have the financial capacity to do it all. We need to be strategic, practical and
smart regarding our Capital Improvement Plan.

This chart also shows the importance of looking at a Capital Improvement Plan for a term longer than a year or
two. Even though we ask for projects to be approved only for the current year. The decisions regarding which
and how many projects make it into that recommendation are influenced by the amount of debt service
incurred over a five year period. If we were reviewing our debt service position simply for FY19 it would look
like we have the ability to absorb more debt service within our policy limit. But you wouldn'tsee the impact of
FY20 — FY24 debt service for the FY19 projects and that impact surely changes the decisions.

Looking at the future years of the Capital Improvement Plan and the projected debt service in this fashion also
allows the Administration to change the plan for the near term as well. Almost all of these project planning
and staging decisions are linked with what is going on today, the upcoming construction season and the
available manpower and access to resources and facilities. The "deferral" chart that appears above removes
approximately one third of the scheduled projects in all funds, and defers the work to future years. In
particular the FY20 School Renovation listed at $65 million moves to FY24 with MSBA funding of 52%.Given
that it took four years to get the Fuller project into the MSBA queue for financing, it is more realistic to plan
move the project from FY20 to FY24. These are exactly the Kinds of discussions that have to happen with the
Mayor, municipal departments and committees, citizen stakeholders and their Council representatives as we
move forward every year with the Capital Improvement Plan.
Debt Service in the Utility Enterprise Fund
While the city does not have a specific policy that limits the amount of debt service in the Enterprise Fund, we
are mindful of the effect that a substantial budget increase as on water and sewer rates. Since the
Administrative Consent Order decree that forced $160 million in work to be completed in five years, the debt
service incurred, even with grants, no-interest and low-interest loans, the debt service increases have been
substantial. Debt Service in the Water Department and Sewer Department budgets is about one-third of the
total budget. In the last two years the Framingham has limited the schedule of capital improvement, deferring
projects to future years. This has reduced the rate of growth of debt service within the budget and allowed
rates to stabilize. The use of retained earnings for some of the smaller capital projects will assist in that effort.
The charts displayed below are specific to each department in the Utility Enterprise Fund — we track the
expense separately in order to correctly allocate the debt service component to the water rate and to the
sewer rate.

The charts above assume approximately 2/3rds of the Capital Improvement Plan for FY20 to FY24 are
recommended by the Mayor and authorized by the City Council. It is unrealistic to project that everything is
move forward, when that has almost never been the case. If you look at the chart below, you can see the
different in the impact on the operating budget when you use the data presented here to make both Capital
Improvement Plan decisions and operating budget decisions in tandem and with a manageable future as part
of the plan. 
Ideal Capital
Improvement Plan
The files and documents accompanying this narrative provide additional background for the projects proposed
for FY19 and deferred to remaining years of the plan. For FY19 in particular there are prices quotes, estimates,
diagrams and pictures included with the project description page. For the FY2020 to FY2024 portion of the
Capital Improvement Plan we have organized the projects in a large grid that is organized by fiscal year and
department and includes a description and justification for each item.
We are transmitting this package electronically at the request of the Finance Subcommittee. We are
happy to produce a hard copy book for any City Councilor who requires it.
