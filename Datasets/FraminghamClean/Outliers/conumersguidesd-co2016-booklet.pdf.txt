M.G.L. c 148 s. 26F - The Law
Massachusetts General Law, chapter 148 section 26F
mandates that upon the sale or transfer of certain homes, 
the seller must install approved smoke alarms. These
requirements apply to residences that were built or modified
prior to creation of the Massachusetts State Building Code
(January 1, 1975). If a building was built or has undergone
renovation, addition or modification after Jan. 1, 1975, the
date the building permit was issued determines the smoke
alarms requirements of the building code.
Although the transfer law applies to residences with five or
less residential units, this pamphlet will focus only on one- 
and two-family homes.
Verification
After a successful inspection for smoke alarm compliance, 
the local fire department will issue a Certificate of
Compliance indicating that the residence meets the smoke
alarm requirements.
Although the law applies to homes built prior to the date
of the building code (Jan. 1975), it is industry practice that
most purchase and sales agreements, and many mortgage
companies require that the seller, as a condition to sell or
transfer, obtain a Certificate of Compliance issued by the
local fire department, even if the home was permitted or
modified after 1975.

Smoke Detector Requirements
All homes are required to have smoke alarms. In general, the
requirements for smoke alarms vary depending on when the
residence was constructed or underwent renovation, addition
or modification.
Photoelectric vs. Ionization Technologies
Photoelectric smoke alarms
•  Use light to detect smoke.
•  More effective in detecting smoldering fires, which
have been attributed to more fires involving death.
•  Household fire warning systems (low voltage or
wireless low voltage systems) only use photoelectric
detectors.
Ionization smoke detectors
•  Use radiation to detect smoke.
•  More effective in detecting flaming fires.
•  Increase the risk of nuisance alarms caused by steam
or cooking smoke.
Carbon Monoxide Alarms
Massachusetts General Law, chapter 148 section 26F½ and
527 CMR 1.00:13.7.6 mandates that upon the sale or transfer
of any residence, the local fire department must inspect the
residence for carbon monoxide alarm compliance. After a
successful inspection, the local fire department will issue a
Certificate of Compliance indicating that the residence meets
the carbon monoxide alarm requirements. Smoke alarm and
CO alarm inspections can be conducted in the same visit.

Carbon Monoxide Alarm Requirements
Since March 31, 2006, carbon monoxide alarms have been
required in all residences that have either: fossil fuel burning
equipment or an attached enclosed garage. This law applied
to all such residences whether or not the residence is being
sold or transferred.
What is Fossil Fuel Burning Equipment?
Fossil fuel burning equipment is any device, apparatus
or appliance that is designed or used to consume fuel of
any kind which emits carbon monoxide as a by-product of
combustion. Some examples of fossil fuel burning equipment
are: gas water heaters, oil or gas furnaces, wood or gas
fireplaces, wood pellet stoves, gas clothes dryers, or gas
cooking stoves.
How Will I Know What I Need?
The word “typical” is used in the following guidelines only
for purposes of illustration. The specific requirements may
depend on when the building permit for the residence
was issued and if there have been any major renovations, 
additions or modifications. It is best to check with your local
building or fire department for detailed guidance.

How Will I Get a Certificate of Compliance?
After you have a closing date:
•  Contact the local fire department to schedule an
inspection of your smoke and carbon monoxide
detectors right away. Don’t wait until the last minute!
•  Fees are determined by each city/town.
Prior to the arrival of the fire department:
•  Make sure that your posted street number is visible
from the street (MGL c.148 § 59);
•  Make sure that you have the proper type of alarms.
–– The local fire department may require that they be taken
down for compliance verification.
–– Make sure that all detectors are installed in the 
proper locations.
–– Make sure that all alarms are working properly.

•  After passing the inspection, the local fire department
will issue your Certificate of Compliance.
–– This document will probably be required at the closing.
How Do I Know if my Smoke Alarm is More
than 10 Years Old or Expired?
The manufacturer’s date is located on the back of the smoke
alarm. Carefully remove the alarm from its mounting bracket
to check the date. 
If there is no date marked, then the alarm is more than 10
years old. If the date indicates it was manufactured more
than 10 years ago, replace it with a new alarm that meets the
requirements identified in this guide. 
How Do I Know Which Kind of 
Smoke Alarm I Have?
A new alarm should be marked on the outside of the
package to indicate if it uses ionization or photoelectric
technology.
For older or existing alarms you will need to remove the
smoke alarm and look on the backside.
•  It is an ionization smoke alarm if the word
“AMERICIUM” or the following symbol is on the back:

Can I Use New Wireless Technology?
Yes you can use new wireless technology. 
•  In homes built before 1975, alarms can be wirelessly
interconnected and can have a replaceable battery as
long as the battery lasts for at least one year.
•  In homes built or modified after 1975, they may be
wirelessly interconnected, but cannot be wirelessly
powered; they must be hard-wired per the State
Building Code.
•  Wireless devices are always allowed with household
fire warning systems.
Household Fire Warning Systems
If you have a household fire warning system, the specific
requirements may be different than those listed here. 
Contact your local fire department.
•  Alarms must comply with Underwriter’s Laboratory
Standard 268.
Are There Other Recommendations?
The State Fire Marshal’s Office recommends:
•  Test your smoke and CO alarms monthly and replace
alkaline batteries twice a year. REMEMBER, when you
change the clocks, change the batteries.
•  Unless otherwise recommended by the manufacturer’s
published instructions, no smoke alarms (battery
operated or hard-wired) shall remain in service after
10 years from the date of manufacture. Combination
CO and smoke alarms may need to be replaced
sooner.

•  Additional replaceable battery-powered smoke alarms
can be installed. Strongly consider a smoke alarm on
the ceiling of each bedroom.
•  Additional non-required smoke alarms may be
photoelectric, ionization or both.
•  People who are deaf or hard of hearing should install
bed shaking devices in the bedroom that connect to
the smoke alarms and strobe alarms in living areas.
•  Consider selecting a carbon monoxide alarm with a
digital display.
