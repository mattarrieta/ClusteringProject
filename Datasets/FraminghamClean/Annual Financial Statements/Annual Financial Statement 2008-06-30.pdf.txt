INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
To the Board of Selectmen
Town of Framingham, Massachusetts
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental
activities, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining
fund information of the Town of Framingham, Massachusetts, as of and for the year
ended June 30, 2008, (except for the Framingham Contributory Retirement System
which is as of and for the year ended December 31, 2007) which collectively
comprise the Town’s basic financial statements as listed in the table of contents. 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Town of Framingham’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits
contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General
of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, 
the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund
information of the Town of Framingham, as of June 30, 2008, (except the
Framingham Contributory Retirement System which is as of December 31, 2007),
and the respective changes in financial position and cash flows, where applicable, 
thereof and the respective budgetary comparison for the General Fund for the year
then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.

The management’s discussion and analysis, appearing on the following pages, 
and the supplementary information, appearing in the back of this report, are not a
required part of the basic financial statements but are supplementary information
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. We have applied certain limited procedures, which consisted principally of
inquiries of management regarding the methods of measurement and presentation
of the required supplementary information. However, we did not audit the
information and express no opinion on it. 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued a report
dated May 18, 2009 on our consideration of the Town’s internal control over financial
reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, 
regulations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that
report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial report-
ing and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on
the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an inte-
gral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards 
and should be considered in assessing the results of our audit.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
As management of the Town of Framingham, we offer readers this narrative over-
view and analysis of the financial activities of the Town of Framingham for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2008. All amounts in the Management’s Discussion and
Analysis unless otherwise indicated, are expressed in thousands of dollars. 
A. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
  The assets of the Town of Framingham exceeded its liabilities at the close
of the most recent fiscal year by $ 223,430 (net assets).  Of this amount, 
$ 51,737 constitutes unrestricted net assets some of which are available
for use as of June 30, 2008. 
  The government’s total net assets changed by $ (16,036) in the fiscal year. 
  As of the close of the current fiscal year, the Town of Framingham’s govern-
mental funds reported combined ending fund balances of $ 13,863, a change
of $ 932 in comparison with the prior year. 
  At the end of the current fiscal year, unreserved/undesignated fund balance
for the general fund was $ 2,864 or 1.4% of total general fund expenditures. 
Management has established an additional $ 93 as a general fund designated
fund balance. 
  The Town of Framingham’s total debt (bonds and bond anticipation notes) 
was $ 85,197, a change of $ 15,142 during the current year. 
B. OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the basic
financial statements. The basic financial statements are comprised of three
components: (1) government-wide financial statements, (2) fund financial state-
ments, and (3) notes to financial statements. This report also contains other
supplementary information in addition to the basic financial statements them-
selves. 
Government-wide financial statements. The government-wide financial state-
ments are designed to provide readers with a broad overview of the Town of
Framingham’s finances in a manner similar to a private-sector business. 
The statement of net assets presents information on all assets and liabilities, with
the difference between the two reported as net assets. Over time, increases or
decreases in net assets may serve as a useful indicator of whether the financial
position of the Town of Framingham is improving or deteriorating.

Page 6
The statement of activities presents information showing how the government’s
net assets changed during the most recent fiscal year. All changes in net assets
are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change occurs, 
regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses
are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows
in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected taxes and earned but unused vacation
leave).
Both of the government-wide financial statements of the Town of Framingham
distinguish functions that are principally supported by taxes and intergovern-
mental revenues (governmental activities) from other functions that are intended
to recover all or a significant portion of their costs through user fees and charges
(business-type activities).  The governmental activities of the Town of
Framingham include general government, public safety, education, public works, 
health and human services, and culture and recreation. The business-type
activities of the Town of Framingham include Water and Sewer activities. 
Fund financial statements. A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is
used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific
activities or objectives. The Town of Framingham, like other state and local
governments, uses fund accounting to ensure and demonstrate compliance with
finance-related legal requirements. All of the funds of the Town of Framingham
can be divided into three categories: governmental funds, proprietary funds and
fiduciary funds. 
Governmental funds. Governmental funds are used to account for essentially
the same functions reported as governmental activities in the government-wide
financial statements. However, unlike the government-wide financial statements, 
governmental fund financial statements focus on near-term inflows and outflows
of spendable resources, as well as on balances of spendable resources available
at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in evaluating
a government’s near-term financing requirements. 
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-
wide financial statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for
governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities
in the government-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better
understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing deci-
sions. Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund
statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances provide a
reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and
governmental activities. 
The Town of Framingham maintains in excess of 100 individual governmental
funds. Information is presented separately in the governmental fund balance
sheet and in the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures and
changes in fund balances for the general fund and the High School Renovation
4
Page 7
fund, which are considered to be major funds. Data from the other governmental
funds are combined into a single aggregated presentation. 
The Town of Framingham adopts an annual appropriated budget for its general
fund. A budgetary comparison statement has been provided for the general fund
to demonstrate compliance with this budget. 
Proprietary funds. The Town of Framingham maintains two different types of
proprietary funds. Enterprise funds are used to report the same functions
presented as business-type activities in the government-wide financial
statements. The Town of Framingham uses enterprise funds to account for its
Water and Sewer operations. Internal service funds are an accounting device
used to accumulate and allocate costs internally among the Town of
Framingham’s various functions. The Town of Framingham uses internal service
funds are used to account for self-insured employee health programs. Because
this service predominantly benefits governmental rather than business-type
functions, they have been included within governmental activities in the
government-wide financial statements. 
Proprietary funds provide the same type of information as the government-wide
financial statements, only in more detail. The proprietary fund financial state-
ments provide separate information for the Water and Sewer operations. Water
and Sewer are considered to be major funds of the Town of Framingham. 
Fiduciary funds.  Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the
benefit of parties outside the government. Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the
government-wide financial statements because the resources of those funds are
not available to support Town of Framingham’s own programs. The accounting 
used for fiduciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds. 
Notes to financial statements. The notes provide additional information that is
essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the government-wide and
fund financial statements. 
Other information. In addition to the basic financial statements and accom-
panying notes, this report also presents certain required supplementary infor-
mation concerning the Town of Framingham’s progress in funding it’s obligation
to provide pension benefits to its employees.

As noted earlier, net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator of a
government’s financial position. In the case of the Town of Framingham, assets
exceeded liabilities by $ 223,430 at the close of the most recent fiscal year. 
The largest portion of the Town of Framingham’s net assets (73.2%) reflects
its investment in capital assets (e.g., land, buildings, machinery, and equipment),
less any related debt used to acquire those assets that is still outstanding. The
Town of Framingham uses these capital assets to provide services to citizens; 
consequently, these assets are not available for future spending. Although the
Town of Framingham’s investment in its capital assets is reported net of related
debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be
provided from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used
to liquidate these liabilities. 
An additional portion of the Town of Framingham’s of net assets (3.7%) repre-
sents resources that are subject to external restrictions on how they may be used
(e.g., grants and trust funds).  The remaining balance of unrestricted net assets
is $ 51,737, which includes amounts that are available for use as of 
June 30, 2008, and other amounts, though measurable, that will not be available
until subsequent periods (e.g., unrestricted fund balances subject to appropria-
tion, taxes and charges billed but not yet collected.)

Page 10
At the end of the current fiscal year, the Town of Framingham is able to report
positive balances in all three categories of net assets, both for the government as
a whole, as well as for its separate governmental and business-type activities. 
Governmental activities. Governmental activities for the year resulted in a
change in net assets of $ (15,566).  Key elements of this change are as follows: 
General fund operations
Special revenue fund operations
General fund transfers from enterprise funds 
$  (2,552)

D. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT’S FUNDS
As noted earlier, the Town of Framingham uses fund accounting to ensure and
demonstrate compliance with finance-related legal requirements. 
Governmental funds. The focus of the Town of Framingham’s governmental
funds is to provide information on near-term inflows, outflows and balances of
spendable resources. Such information is useful in assessing the Town of
Framingham’s financing requirements. In particular, unreserved fund balance
may serve as a useful measure of a government’s net resources available for
spending at the end of the fiscal year. 
As of the end of the current fiscal year, the Town’s governmental funds reported
combined ending fund balances of $ 13,863, a change of $ 932 in comparison
with the prior year. 
A portion of the fund balance is reserved to indicate that it is not available for new
spending because it has already been committed (1) to liquidate contracts and
8
Page 11
purchase orders of the prior period $ 5,525 and (2) to be used as a funding
source for the subsequent budget $ 1,445. 
The general fund is the chief operating fund of the Town. At the end of the
current fiscal year, unreserved undesignated fund balance of the general fund
was $ 2,864 while total fund balance was $ 5,749. As a measure of the general
fund’s liquidity, it may be useful to compare both unreserved fund balance and
total fund balance to total fund expenditures. Unreserved fund balance repre-
sents 1.4% of total general fund expenditures, while total fund balance repre-
sents 2.7% of that same amount. Management has established $ 93 of the
general fund balance to pay the debt service on the current notes payable. The
following table highlights the change in our General fund balance accounts (in
thousands):

Proprietary funds. The Town of Framingham’s proprietary funds provide the
same type of information found in the business-type activities reported in the
government-wide financial statements, but in more detail. 
Unrestricted net assets of the enterprise funds at the end of the year amounted
to $ 19,378. The total change in net assets was $ (470).  Other factors concern-
ing the finances of these three funds have already been addressed in the discus-
sion of the Town of Framingham’s business-type activities. 
Other factors concerning the finances of proprietary funds have already been
addressed in the entity-wide discussion of business-type activities. 
E. GENERAL FUND BUDGETARY HIGHLIGHTS
Differences between the original budget and the final amended budget resulted
in an overall change in appropriations of $ 912, due to a change in General
Government of $ 878, Public Safety of $ 31, Education of $ (40), Human
Services of $ (22), Culture and Recreation of $ 25, and Employee Benefits of
$ 40. The additional appropriations were funded by transfers from other funds.

F. CAPITAL ASSET AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION
Capital assets. The Town of Framingham’s investment in capital assets for its
governmental and business-type activities as of June 30, 2008 amounts to
$ 240,925 (net of accumulated depreciation).  This investment in capital assets
includes land, buildings, system, improvements, machinery and equipment, park
facilities, roads, highways and bridges. 
The following is a summary of the Town’s Capital Assets for the current and prior
fiscal years (in thousands):

Significant Capital Asset activity for fiscal year 2008 included: 
  Completion of construction of the Framingham High School had been
extended to the summer of 2007 due to financial constraints of the general
contractor. To meet additional cost needs, in October 2004, the Town
appropriated an additional $ 5,237 for the renovation, addition and equipping
of the Framingham High School. This appropriation is in addition to the initial
appropriation of $ 54,000. Total architectural design and construction costs
are now estimated at $ 59,237. This project is being financed through the
issuance of debt that was excluded from the limits of Proposition 2 ½ by voter
referendum. The project has been approved for 90% reimbursement from the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts under the guidelines for school building
projects in districts with approved Racial Balance plans. The Massachusetts
School Building Authority has instituted a “pay as you build” Progress Pay-
ment System which was designed to decrease a municipality’s need from
having to issue debt to finance the Authority’s share of projects costs. 
Through July, Framingham has received $ 52,238 in reimbursement which
was used to pay-off bond anticipation notes. The Town submitted the final
close out information to the Massachusetts School Building Authority in
January 2009. 
  In October 2003, Town Meeting authorized $ 1,800 in borrowing to purchase
an existing building and convert it into a Senior Center. These funds, com-
10
Page 13
bined with an additional $ 1,800 in donations, were used to purchase land and
building in July 2004. The Senior Center was opened the summer of 2005. 
At the 2005 Annual Town Meeting, the Town authorized an additional $ 372
for renovations on the second floor which were substantially completed by the
summer of 2007. At the 2007 Annual Town Meeting, the Town authorized an
additional $ 468 to develop a 4,336 square foot multi-purpose function room
and caterers kitchen. The Contract was awarded in August 2008. 
  The Department of Public Works started construction on the three sewer
projects appropriated in FY07 after completing design and funding applica-
tions in the prior year. Approximately 4,000 feet of sewer lines were installed
in Water Street with $ 4,053 of the $ 7,295 being expended. Gregory Road, 
which is part of the Water Street Project, had $ 496 of the $ 745 being
expended. Of the $ 3,500 appropriated for Fenwick Pump Station, $ 2,356
has been expended on reconstruction which started up again in March and
should be completed in 2009. The Fenwick Pump Station and Water Street
reconstruction received partial funding via a 2% Clean Water State Revolving

RECONCILIATION OF THE STATEMENT OF REVENUES
EXPENDITURES, AND CHANGES IN FUND BALANCES OF
GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS TO THE STATEMENT OF ACTIVITIES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2008
NET CHANGES IN FUND BALANCES - TOTAL GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS
Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures. However,
in the Statement of Activities the cost of those assets is allocated
over their estimated useful lives and reported as depreciation expense:
Capital outlay purchases, net of disposals
Depreciation
Revenues in the Statement of Activities that do not provide current
financial resources are fully deferred in the Statement of Revenues,
Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balances. Therefore, the
recognition of revenue for various types of accounts receivable
(i.e., real estate and personal property, motor vehicle excise, etc.)
differ between the two statements. This amount represents the
net change in deferred revenue.
Some revenues reported in the Statement of Activities, such as
MSBA reimbursements for contracted assistance, do not provide
current financial resources and therefore, are not reported as
revenues in the governmental funds.
The issuance of long-term debt (e.g., bonds and leases) provides
current financial resources to governmental funds, while the
repayment of the principal of long-term debt consumes the financial
resources of governmental funds. Neither transaction, however, 
has any effect on net assets:
Issuance of debt
Repayments of debt, including capital leases
In the statement of activities, interest is accrued on outstanding
long-term debt, whereas in governmental funds interest is not
reported until due.
Some expenses reported in the Statement of Activities, do not require
the use of current financial resources and therefore, are not reported
as expenditures in the governmental funds.
Decrease in liability for compensated absences
Increase in OPEB liability
Internal service funds are used by management to account for health
insurance and workers' compensation activities. The net activity of
internal service funds is reported with Governmental Activities.

TOWN OF FRAMINGHAM, MASSACHUSETTS
Notes to Financial Statements
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies of the Town of Framingham (the Town) conform to
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as applicable to govern-
mental units. The following is a summary of the more significant policies: 
A. Reporting Entity
The government is a municipal corporation governed by an elected Board
of Selectmen. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, 
these financial statements present the government and applicable compo-
nent units for which the government is considered to be financially
accountable. 
Blended Component Units - Blended component units are entities that are
legally separate, but are so related that they are, in substance, the same
as the primary government, providing services entirely or almost entirely
for the benefit of the primary government. The following component unit is
blended within the primary government: 
In the Fiduciary Funds: The Framingham Contributory Retirement
System which was established to provide retirement benefits primarily
to employees and their beneficiaries. The System is presented using
the accrual basis of accounting and is reported as a pension trust fund
in the fiduciary fund financial statements. Additional financial informa-
tion of the System can be obtained by contacting the System located at
150 Concord Street, Framingham, MA 01702. 
B. Government-Wide and Fund Financial Statements
Government-Wide Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statements (i.e., the statement of net
assets and the statement of changes in net assets) report information
on all of the nonfiduciary activities of the primary government. For the
most part, the effect of interfund activity has been removed from these
statements. Governmental activities, which normally are supported by
taxes and intergovernmental revenues, are reported separately from
business-type activities, which rely to a significant extent on fees and
charges for support. Likewise, the primary government is reported
separately from certain legally separate component units for which the
primary government is financially accountable. 
Page 30
The statement of activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct
expenses of a given function or segment are offset by program revenues. 
Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific func-
tion or segment. Program revenues include (1) charges to customers
or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, 
or privileges provided by a given function or segment and (2) grants
and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital
requirements of a particular function or segment. Taxes and other items
not properly included among program revenues are reported instead as
general revenues.
Fund Financial Statements
Separate financial statements are provided for governmental funds, 
proprietary funds and fiduciary funds, even though the latter are excluded
from the government-wide financial statements. Major individual govern-
mental funds and major individual enterprise funds are reported as
separate columns in the fund financial statements. 
C. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement
Presentation
Government-Wide Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the econ-
omic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting,
as is the proprietary fund and fiduciary fund financial statements. Reve-
nues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liabil-
ity is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property
taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are levied. 
Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all elig-
ibility requirements imposed by the provider have been met. As a general
rule, the effect of interfund activity has been eliminated from the govern-
ment-wide financial statements. 
Amounts reported as program revenues include (1) charges to customers
or applicants for goods, services, or privileges provided, (2) operating
grants and contributions, and (3) capital grants and contributions, includ-
ing special assessments. Internally dedicated resources are reported as
general revenues rather than as program revenues. Likewise, general
revenues include all taxes and excises. 
Fund Financial Statements
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current
financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of
accounting.  Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measur-
able and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they
are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay
liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the government con-
siders property tax revenues to be available if they are collected within
60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. All other revenue items are
28
Page 31
considered to be measurable and available only when cash is received
by the government. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is
incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expendi-
tures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and
claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is due. 
The government reports the following major governmental funds: 
 The general fund is the government’s primary operating fund. 
It accounts for all financial resources of the general government, 
except those required to be accounted for in another fund. 
 The high school renovation fund accounts for all costs related to
construction of the new high school. 
Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-
operating items. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from
providing services and producing and delivering goods in connection with
a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The principal operating
revenues of the enterprise fund are charges to customers for sales and
services. Operating expenses for enterprise funds include the cost of
sales and services, administrative expenses and depreciation on capital
assets. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are
reported as nonoperating revenues and expenses. 
Private-sector standards of accounting and financial reporting issued
prior to December 1, 1989 generally are followed in both the government-
wide and proprietary fund financial statements to the extent that those
standards do not conflict with or contradict guidance of the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board. Governments also have the option of
following subsequent private-sector guidance for their business-type
activities and enterprise funds, subject to this same limitation. The
government has elected not to follow subsequent private-sector guidance. 
The government reports the following major proprietary funds: 
 The water fund is used to report the Town’s water enterprise fund
operations. 
 The sewer fund is used to report the Town’s sewer enterprise fund
operations. 
The self-insured employee health program is reported as an internal
service fund in the accompanying financial statements. 
The pension trust fund accounts for the activities of the Employees
Contributory Retirement System, which accumulates resources for
pension benefit payments to qualified employees. 
29
Page 32
The agency fund is custodial in nature and is used to account for funds
held for others. Agency funds report only assets and liabilities, and thus
have no measurement focus. 
D. Cash and Short-Term Investments
Cash balances from all funds, except those required to be segregated by
law, are combined to form a consolidation of cash. Cash balances are
invested to the extent available, and interest earnings are recognized in
the General Fund. Certain special revenue, proprietary, and fiduciary
funds segregate cash, and investment earnings become a part of those
funds. 
Deposits with financial institutions consist primarily of demand deposits, 
certificates of deposits, and savings accounts. A cash and investment
pool is maintained that is available for use by all funds. Each fund’s
portion of this pool is reflected on the combined financial statements
under the caption “cash and short-term investments”.  The interest
earnings attributable to each fund type was included under investment
income. 
For purpose of the statement of cash flows, the proprietary funds consider
investments with original maturities of three months or less to be short-
term investments. 
E. Investments
State and local statutes place certain limitations on the nature of deposits
and investments available. Deposits in any financial institution may not
exceed certain levels within the financial institution. Non-fiduciary fund
investments can be made in securities issued by or unconditionally
guaranteed by the U.S. Government or agencies that have a maturity of
one year or less from the date of purchase and repurchase agreements
guaranteed by such securities with maturity dates of no more than 90 days
from the date of purchase. 
Investments for the Contributory Retirement System are fully invested in
the Commonwealth’s Pension Reserve Investment Trust, and are carried
at fair value. 
F. Property Tax Limitations
Legislation known as “Proposition 2 ½” has limited the amount of revenue
that can be derived from property taxes. The prior fiscal year’s tax levy
limit is used as a base and cannot increase by more than 2.5 percent
(excluding new growth), unless an override is voted. The actual fiscal
year 2008 tax levy reflected an excess capacity of $ 61,879.

G. Inventories
Inventories are valued at cost using the first-in/first-out (FIFO) method. 
The costs of governmental fund-type inventories are recorded as expendi-
tures when purchased rather than when consumed. No significant
inventory balances were on hand in governmental funds. 
H. Capital Assets
Capital assets, which include property, plant, equipment, and infra-
structure assets are reported in the applicable governmental or business-
type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements. 
Capital assets are defined by the government as assets with an initial
individual cost of more than $ 5,000 and an estimated useful life in excess
of two years. Such assets are recorded at historical cost or estimated
historical cost if purchased or constructed. Donated capital assets are
recorded at estimated fair market value at the date of donation. 
The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value
of the asset or materially extend assets lives are not capitalized. 
Major outlays for capital assets and improvements are capitalized as pro-
jects are constructed. Interest incurred during the construction phase of
capital assets of business-type activities is included as part of the capital-
ized value of the assets constructed. 
Property, plant and equipment of the primary government, as well as the
component units, is depreciated using the straight-line method over the
following estimated useful lives: 
Assets
Buildings
Building improvements
Infrastructure
Vehicles
Machinery, equipment and furnishings
Computer equipment

I. Compensated Absences
The government’s policy is to permit employees to accumulate earned but
unused vacation and sick pay benefits. All vested sick and vacation pay is
accrued when incurred in the government-wide, proprietary, and fiduciary
fund financial statements. A liability for these amounts is reported in
governmental funds only if they have matured, for example, as a result of
employee resignations and retirements. 
31
Page 34
J. Long-Term Obligations
In the government-wide financial statements, and proprietary fund types in
the fund financial statements, long-term debt, and other long-term obliga-
tions are reported as liabilities in the applicable governmental activities, 
business-type activities, or proprietary fund type statement of net assets. 
K. Fund Equity
In the fund financial statements, governmental funds report reservations
of fund balance for amounts that are not available for appropriation or are
legally restricted by outside parties for use for a specific purpose. Desig-
nations of fund balance represent tentative management plans that are
subject to change. 
L. Use of Estimates
The preparation of basic financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures for contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the basic
financial statements, and the reported amounts of the revenues and
expenditures/expenses during the fiscal year. Actual results could vary
from estimates that were used. 
2. Stewardship, Compliance, and Accountability
A. Budgetary Information
At the annual town meeting, the Chief Financial Officer presents an
operating and capital budget for the proposed expenditures of the fiscal
year commencing the following July 1. The budget, as enacted by town
meeting, establishes the legal level of control and specifies that certain
appropriations are to be funded by particular revenues. The original
budget is amended during the fiscal year at special town meetings as
required by changing conditions. In cases of extraordinary or unforeseen
expenses, the Finance Committee is empowered to transfer funds from
the Reserve Fund (a contingency appropriation) to a departmental
appropriation. “Extraordinary” includes expenses which are not in the
usual line, or are great or exceptional. “Unforeseen” includes expenses
which are not foreseen as of the time of the annual meeting when appro-
priations are voted. 
Departments are limited to the line items as voted. Certain items may
exceed the line item budget as approved if it is for an emergency and for
the safety of the general public. These items are limited by the Massa-
chusetts General Laws and must be raised in the next year’s tax rate. 
32
Page 35
Formal budgetary integration is employed as a management control
device during the year for the General Fund and Proprietary Funds. 
Effective budgetary control is achieved for all other funds through
provisions of the Massachusetts General Laws. 
At year end, appropriation balances lapse, except for certain unexpended
capital items and encumbrances which will be honored during the subse-
quent year. 
B. Budgetary Basis
The General Fund final appropriation appearing on the “Budget and
Actual” page of the fund financial statements represents the final amended
budget after all reserve fund transfers and supplemental appropriations. 
C. Budget/GAAP Reconciliation
The budgetary data for the general and proprietary funds is based upon
accounting principles that differ from generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples (GAAP).  Therefore, in addition to the GAAP basis financial state-
ments, the results of operations of the general fund are presented in
accordance with budgetary accounting principles to provide a meaningful
comparison with budgetary data. 
The following is a summary of adjustments made to the actual revenues
and other sources, and expenditures and other uses, to conform to the
budgetary basis of accounting.

3. Cash and Short-Term Investments
Custodial Credit Risk - Deposits. Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the
event of a bank failure, the Town’s and Contributory Retirement System’s (the
System) deposits may not be returned. Massachusetts General Law Chapter
44, Section 55, limits the Town’s deposits “in a bank or trust company or
banking company to an amount not exceeding sixty percent of the capital and
surplus of such bank or trust company or banking company, unless
satisfactory security is given to it by such bank or trust company or banking
company for such excess.”
Massachusetts General Law Chapter 32, Section 23, limits the System’s
deposits “in a bank or trust company to an amount not exceeding ten percent
of the capital and surplus of such bank or trust company.” The Town and
System do not have a deposit policy for custodial credit risk. 
As of June 30, 2008 and December 31, 2007, $ 20,127,512 and $ 288,351 of
the Town’s and System’s bank balances of $ 31,259,646 and $ 1,156,775, 
respectively, was exposed to custodial credit risk as uninsured, uncollateral-
ized, and collateral held by pledging bank’s trust department not in the Town’s
and System’s name
4. Investments
A. Credit Risk
Generally, credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not
fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment. For short-term invest-
ments that were purchased using surplus revenues, Massachusetts
General Law, Chapter 44, Section 55, limits the Town’s investments to the
top rating issued by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating
organization (NRSROs).
Presented below (in thousands) are the Town’s investments at June 30, 
2008, and, where applicable, the average credit rating of the fixed income
securities (All federal agency securities have an implied credit rating of
AAA):

Page 39
Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 32, Section 23, limits the investment
of System funds, to the extent not required for current disbursements, in the
PRIT Fund or in securities, other than mortgages or collateral loans, which
are legal for the investment of funds in savings banks under the laws of the
Commonwealth, provided that no more than the established percentage of
assets, is invested in any one security. 
At December 31, 2007, the Contributory Retirement System maintained its
investments in the State Investment Pool* with a fair value of $ 217,096,143. 
This investment type is not rated. 
*Fair value is the same as the value of the pool share. The Pension Reserves Investment
Trust was created under Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 32, Section 22, in December
1983. The Pension Reserves Investment Trust is operated under contract with a private
investment advisor, approved by the Pension Reserves Investment Management Board. The
Pension Reserves Investment Management Board shall choose an investment advisor by
requesting proposals from advisors and reviewing such proposals based on criteria adopted
under Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 30B. 
B. Custodial Credit Risk
The custodial credit risk for investments is the risk that, in the event of the
failure of the counterparty (e.g. broker-dealer) to a transaction, a govern-
ment will not be able to recover the value of its investment or collateral
securities that are in the possession of another party. The Town and
System do not have policies for custodial credit risk. 
Of the investment in Corporate bonds of $ 840,524, the government has a
custodial credit risk exposure of $ 840,524 because the related securities
are uninsured, unregistered and held by the Town’s brokerage firm, which
is also the Counterparty to these securities. 
C. Concentration of Credit Risk
The Town places no limit on the amount the Town may invest in any one
issuer. 
Town investments in any one issuer (other than U.S. Treasury securities
and mutual funds) that represent 5% or more of total investments are as
follows: 
Federal Home Loan Bank
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
Federal National Mortgage Association 
$ 1,517,309
1,671,671
1,366,925
Massachusetts General Law Chapter 32, Section 23 limits the amount the
System may invest in any one issuer or security type, with the exception of
the PRIT Fund. 
37
Page 40
The Contributory Retirement System does not have an investment in one
issuer greater than 5% of total investments. 
D. Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will
adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Generally, the longer
the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value
to changes in market interest rates. The Town and System do not have
a formal investment policy that limits investment maturities as a means of
managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest
rates

ments to market interest rate fluctuations is as follows (in thousands):

E. Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates
will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. The Town does not
have policies for foreign currency risk. 
5. Taxes Receivable
Real estate and personal property taxes are levied and based on values
assessed on January 1st of every year. Assessed values are established by
the Board of Assessor’s for 100% of the estimated fair market value. Taxes
are due on a quarterly basis and are subject to penalties and interest if they
are not paid by the respective due date. Real estate and personal property
taxes levied are recorded as receivables in the fiscal year they relate to. 
Fourteen days after the due date for the final tax bill for real estate taxes, a
demand notice may be sent to the delinquent taxpayer. Fourteen days after
the demand notice has been sent, the tax collector may proceed to file a lien
against the delinquent taxpayers’ property. The Town has an ultimate right to
foreclose on property for unpaid taxes. Personal property taxes cannot be
secured through the lien process.

E. Legal Debt Margin
The Town is subject to the General Laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts which, in general, limits the amount of bonded debt
the Town may have outstanding to 5 percent of the valuation of taxable
property as last equalized by the Commonwealth’s Department of
Revenue. The following is a computation of the legal debt margin as
of June 30, 2008 (in thousands):

F. Advance and Current Refundings
Prior Year
In prior years, the Town has defeased various bond issues by creating
separate irrevocable trust funds. The proceeds from the new issuance
of the general obligation bonds were used to purchase U.S. government
securities, and those securities were deposited in an irrevocable trust with
an escrow agent to provide debt service payments until the refunded
bonds mature on March 15, 2015. For financial reporting purposes, the
debt has been considered defeased and therefore removed as a liability
from the Town’s balance sheet. As of June 30, 2008, the amount of
defeased debt outstanding but removed from the governmental activities
and business-type activities was $ 5,595,000.

14. Restricted Net Assets
The accompanying entity-wide financial statements report restricted net
assets when external constraints from grantors or contributors are placed
on net assets. 
Permanent fund restricted net assets are segregated between nonexpend-
able and expendable. The nonexpendable portion represents the original
restricted principal contribution, and the expendable represents accumulated
earnings which are available to be spent based on donor restrictions. 
15. Reserves and Designations of Fund Equity
“Reserves” of fund equity are established to segregate fund balances which
are either not available for expenditure in the future or are legally set aside for
a specific future use. Fund “designations,” which are not legally required
segregations, have also been established to indicate tentative plans for future
financial utilization. 
The following types of reserves are reported at June 30, 2008: 
Reserved for Encumbrances and continuing Appropriations - An account
used to segregate that portion of fund balance committed for expenditure of
financial resources upon vendor performance. 
47
Page 50
Reserved for Expenditures - Represents the amount of fund balance
appropriated to be used for expenditures in the subsequent year budget. 
Reserved for Perpetual Funds - Represents the principal of the nonexpend-
able trust fund investments. The balance cannot be spent for any purpose; 
however, it may be invested and the earnings may be spent. 
Unreserved Designated - Represents the amount of fund balance designated
for petty cash, inventory, and future debt service. 
16. General Fund Undesignated Fund Balance
The undesignated general fund balance reported on the balance sheet is
stated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
which differs in certain respects from the Massachusetts Uniform Municipal
Accounting System (UMAS).  The following paragraphs summarize the major
differences. 
Massachusetts general laws include provisions to allow municipalities to
overexpend certain appropriations if they are incurred in an emergency
situation and for the safety of the public. The most common example involves
the “snow and ice” appropriation. All such overexpenditures, however, must
be funded in the subsequent year’s tax rate. 
Massachusetts General Laws require that non-property tax revenue budget
shortfalls, net of appropriation turnbacks, be funded in the subsequent year. 
The same treatment is also applied to the excess of actual property tax
abatements and exemptions over the provision for abatements and
exemptions (overlay).
The Massachusetts State Legislation also allowed municipalities to defer
funding for a portion of the 1992 and 1993 teachers summer pay to future
years. This must be funded within a 15 year period, beginning in 1997. 
The accompanying financial statements include an estimate for future
potential tax refunds, which is not recognized under UMAS. 
The following summarizes the specific differences between GAAP basis and
budgetary basis of reporting the general fund undesignated fund balance:

17. Subsequent Events
Investments
Since September 2008, the stock market suffered significant losses. As a
result, there may be a substantial depreciation in the value of the organiza-
tion’s investments. 
18. Commitments and Contingencies
Outstanding Lawsuits - There are several pending lawsuits in which the Town
is involved. The Town’s management is of the opinion that the potential
future settlement of such claims would not materially affect its financial
statements taken as a whole. 
Grants - Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to
audit and adjustment by grantor agencies, principally the federal government. 
Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute
a liability of the applicable funds. The amount of expenditures which may
be disallowed by the grantor cannot be determined at this time, although the
Town expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 
19. Post-Employment Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits
Other Post-Employment Benefits
During the year, the Town implemented GASB Statement 45, Accounting and
Financial Reporting by Employers for Post-Employment Benefits Other Than
Pensions. Statement 45 requires governments to account for other post-
employment benefits (OPEB), primarily healthcare, on an accrual basis rather
than on a pay-as-you-go basis. The effect is the recognition of an actuarially
required contribution as an expense on the statement of revenues, expenses, 
and changes in net assets when a future retiree earns their post-employment
benefits, rather than when they use their post-employment benefit. To the
extent that an entity does not fund their actuarially required contribution, a
post-employment benefit liability is recognized on the Statement of Net
Assets over time. 
A. Plan Description
In addition to providing the pension benefits described, the Town provides
post-employment health care and life insurance benefits for retired
employees through the Town’s plan. The benefits, benefit levels, 
employee contributions and employer contributions are governed by
Chapter 32 of the Massachusetts General Laws. As of July 1, 2008, the
actuarial valuation date, approximately 1,538 retirees and 1,895 active
49
Page 52
employees meet the eligibility requirements. The plan does not issue a
separate financial report. 
B. Benefits Provided
The Town provides medical, prescription drug, mental health/substance
abuse and life insurance to retirees and their covered dependents. All
active employees who retire from the Town and meet the eligibility criteria
will receive these benefits. 
C. Funding Policy
Retirees contribute various percentages of the cost of the health plan, as
determined by the Town. The Town contributes the remainder of the
health plan costs on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
D. Annual OPEB Costs and Net OPEB Obligation
The Town ’s fiscal 2008 annual OPEB expense is calculated based on the
annual required contribution of the employer (ARC), an amount actuarially
determined in accordance with the parameters of GASB Statement No. 
45. The ARC represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing
basis, is projected to cover the normal cost per year and amortize the
unfunded actuarial liability over a period of thirty years. The following
table shows the components of the Town’s annual OPEB cost for the year
ending June 30, 2008, the amount actually contributed to the plan, and the
change in the Town’s net OPEB obligation based on an actuarial valuation
as of July 1, 2008.

E. Funded Status and Funding Progress
The funded status of the plan as of July 1, 2008, the date of the most
recent actuarial valuation was as follows:

Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of
reported amount and assumptions about the probability of occurrence of
events far into the future. Examples included assumptions about future
employment, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend. Amounts
determined regarding the funded status of the plan and the annual
required contributions of the employer are subject to continual revision as
actual results are compared with past expectations and new estimates are
made about the future. The schedule of funding progress, presented as
required supplementary information following the notes to the financial
statements, presents multiyear trend information that shows whether the
actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative
to the actuarial accrued liabilities for benefits. 
F. Actuarial Methods and Assumptions
Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the
plan as understood by the Town and the plan members and include the
types of benefits provided at the time of each valuation and the historical
pattern of sharing of benefit costs between the Town and plan members to
that point. The actuarial methods and assumptions used include
techniques that are designed to reduce short-term volatility in actuarial
accrued liabilities and the actuarial value of assets, consistent with the
long-term perspective of the calculations. 
In the July 1, 2008 actuarial valuation the projected unit credit cost method
was used. The actuarial value of assets was not determined as the Town
has not advance funded its obligation. The actuarial assumptions included
a 4% investment rate of return and an initial annual healthcare cost trend
rate of 7% which decreases to a 5% long-term rate for all healthcare
benefits after five years. The amortization costs for the initial UAAL is a
level percentage of payroll for a period of 30 years, on a closed basis. 
This has been calculated assuming the amortization payment increases at
a rate of 4.5%.

20. Contributory Retirement System
The Town follows the provisions of GASB Statement No. 27, Accounting for
Pensions for State and Local Government Employees, (as amended by
GASB 50) with respect to the employees’ retirement funds. 
A. Plan Description and Contribution Information
Substantially all employees of the Town (except teachers and administra-
tors under contract employed by the School Department) are members of
the Framingham Contributory Retirement System (FCRS), a cost sharing, 
multiple employer defined benefit PERS. Eligible employees must partici-
pate in the FCRS. The pension plan provides pension benefits, deferred
allowances, and death and disability benefits. Chapter 32 of the
Massachusetts General Laws establishes the authority of the FCRS
Retirement Board. Chapter 32 also establishes contribution percentages
and benefits paid. The FCRS Retirement Board does not have the
authority to amend benefit provisions. As required by Massachusetts
General Laws, the System issues a separate report to the Common-
wealth’s Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission. 
Membership of each plan consisted of the following at December 31, 
2007, the date of the latest actuarial valuation: 
Retirees and beneficiaries receiving benefits

Employee contribution percentages are specified in Chapter 32 of the
Massachusetts General Laws. The percentage is determined by the
participant’s date of entry into the system. All employees hired after
January 1, 1979 contribute an additional 2% on all gross regular earnings
over the rate of $ 30,000 per year. The percentages are as follows: 
Before January 1, 1975
January 1, 1975 - December 31, 1983

B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Accounting - Contributory retirement system financial statements
are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Plan member contri-
butions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are due. 
Employer contributions are recognized when due and the employer has
made a formal commitment to provide the contributions. Benefits and
refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the
terms of the plan. 
Method Used to Value Investments - Investments are reported at fair
value in accordance with PERAC requirements.

Page 56
D. Actuarial Methods and Assumptions
The annual required contribution for the current year was determined as
part of the actuarial valuation using the entry age normal actuarial cost
method. Under this method an unfunded actuarial accrued liability of
$ 64.9 million was calculated. The actuarial assumptions included (a) 8 %
investment rate of return and (b) a projected salary increase of 4.75 - 5.25
% per year. Liabilities for cost of living increases have been assumed at
an annual increase of 3 %, on the first $ 12,000 of benefit payments. The
actuarial value of assets is determined by projecting the market value of
assets as of the beginning of the prior plan year with the assumed rate of
return during that year (8 %) and accounting for deposits and disburse-
ments with interest at the assumed rate of return. An adjustment is then
applied to recognize the difference between the actual investment return
and expected return over a five-year period. As of December 31, 2007, 
the unfunded actuarially accrued liability is being amortized over 18 years
using an 0.25 % annual increasing basis. 
E. Teachers
As required by State statutes, teachers of the Town are covered by the
Massachusetts Teachers Retirement System (MTRS).  The MTRS is
funded by contributions from covered employees and the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts. The Town is not required to contribute. All persons
employed on at least a half-time basis, who are covered under a contrac-
tual agreement requiring certification by the Board of Education are eligi-
ble, and must participate in the MTRS. 
Based on the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ retirement laws, employ-
ees covered by the pension plan must contribute a percentage of gross
earnings into the pension fund. The percentage is determined by the
participant’s date of entry into the system and gross earnings, up to
$ 30,000, as follows: 
Before January 1, 1975
January 1, 1975 - December 31, 1983
January 1, 1984 - June 30, 1996
July 1, 1996 - June 30, 2001

5%
7% *
8% *
9% *
