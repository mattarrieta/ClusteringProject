To the Board of Selectmen
Town of Framingham, Massachusetts
Report on the Financial Statements 
Additional Offices:
Nashua, NH
Manchester, NH
Greenfield, MA
Ellsworth, ME
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activi-
ties, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund
information of the Town of Framingham, Massachusetts, as of and for the year
ended June 30, 2014 (except for the Framingham Contributory Retirement System
which is as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013), and the related notes to
the financial statements, which collectively comprise the Town’s basic financial
statements as listed in the Table of Contents. 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
The Town’s management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, 
and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error. 
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on our
audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial
audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller
General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free from material misstatement. 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the
auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
Page 4
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assess-
ments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and
fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by manage-
ment, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinions. 
Opinions
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, the business- 
type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the
Town of Framingham, as of June 30, 2014 (except for the Framingham Contributory
Retirement System which is as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013), and
the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof
and the respective budgetary comparison for the general fund for the year then ended
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. 
Other Matters 
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require
that Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Schedule of Funding Progress be
presented to supplement the basic financial statements. Such information, although
not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board, who considers it to be an essential part of financial
reporting for placing the basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, 
economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the
required supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America, which consisted of inquiries of manage-
ment about the methods of preparing the information and comparing the information
for consistency with management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial
statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial
statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the infor-
mation because the limited procedures do not provide us with evidence sufficient to
express an opinion or provide any assurance.

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report
dated March 25, 2015 on our consideration of the Town's internal control over
financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, 
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that
report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial report-
ing and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on
internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral
part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in
considering the Town’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
As management of the Town of Framingham, we offer readers this narrative over-
view and analysis of the financial activities of the Town of Framingham for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2014. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts reported in this
analysis are expressed in thousands. 
A. OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the basic
financial statements. The basic financial statements are comprised of three com-
ponents: (1) government-wide financial statements, (2) fund financial statements, 
and (3) notes to financial statements. This report also contains other supple-
mentary information in addition to the basic financial statements themselves. 
Government-wide financial statements. The government-wide financial state-
ments are designed to provide readers with a broad overview of our finances in
a manner similar to a private-sector business. 
The Statement of Net Position presents information on all assets and liabilities, 
with the difference between the two reported as net position. Over time, increases
or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the finan-
cial position is improving or deteriorating. 
The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the government’s
net position changed during the most recent fiscal year. All changes in net posi-
tion are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change
occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, revenues and
expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in
cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected taxes and earned but unused
vacation leave).
Both of the government-wide financial statements distinguish functions that are
principally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues (governmental
activities) from other functions that are intended to recover all or a significant
portion of their costs through user fees and charges (business-type activities).
The governmental activities include general government, public safety, educa-
tion, public works, health and human services, and culture and recreation. The
business-type activities include water and sewer activities. 
Fund financial statements. A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used
to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific activi-
ties or objectives. Fund accounting is used to ensure and demonstrate compli-
ance with finance-related legal requirements. All of the funds can be divided into
three categories: governmental funds, proprietary funds and fiduciary funds. 
4
Page 7
Governmental funds. Governmental funds are used to account for essentially
the same functions reported as governmental activities in the government-wide
financial statements. However, unlike the government-wide financial statements, 
governmental fund financial statements focus on near-term inflows and outflows
of spendable resources, as well as on balances of spendable resources available
at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in evaluating a gov-
ernment’s near-term financing requirements. 
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-
wide financial statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for
governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities
in the government-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better
understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing deci-
sions. Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund
statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances provide a
reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and gov-
ernmental activities. 
An annual appropriated budget is adopted for the general fund. A budgetary
comparison statement has been provided for the general fund to demonstrate
compliance with this budget. 
Proprietary funds. Proprietary funds are maintained as follows: 
Enterprise funds are used to report the same functions presented as business-
type activities in the government-wide financial statements. Specifically, enter-
prise funds are used to account for water and sewer operations. 
Internal service funds are an accounting device used to accumulate and allocate
costs internally among various functions. Specifically, internal service funds are
used to account for self-insured employee health programs. Because these ser-
vices predominantly benefit governmental rather than business-type functions, 
they have been included within governmental activities in the government-wide
financial statements. The Town converted from a self-insurance program to a
premium-based program through GIC insurance for fiscal year 2015. 
Proprietary funds provide the same type of information as the business-type activ-
ities reported in the government-wide financial statements, only in more detail. 
The proprietary fund financial statements provide separate information for the
water and sewer operations, both of which are considered to be major funds. 
Fiduciary funds. Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the
benefit of parties outside the government. Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the
government-wide financial statements because the resources of those funds are
not available to support the Town’s own programs. The accounting used for fidu-
ciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds.

Notes to financial statements. The notes provide additional information that is
essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the government-wide and
fund financial statements. 
Other information. In addition to the basic financial statements and accom-
panying notes, this report also presents certain required supplementary infor-
mation which is required to be disclosed by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. 
B. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

As noted earlier, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of a govern-
ment’s financial position. At the close of the most recent fiscal year, total net posi-
tion was $174,776, a change of $(9,668) from the prior year. 
The largest portion of net position, $192,323 reflects our investment in capital
assets (e.g., land, construction in progress, buildings and improvements, vehicles, 
machinery, equipment, and infrastructure); less any related debt used to acquire
those assets that are still outstanding. These capital assets are used to provide
services to citizens; consequently, these assets are not available for future spend-
ing. Although the investment in capital assets is reported net of related debt, it
should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided
from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liqui-
date these liabilities. 
An additional portion of net position, $10,472 represents resources that are sub-
ject to external restrictions on how they may be used. The remaining balance
of unrestricted net position, $(28,019) may be used to meet the government’s
ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors.

Governmental activities. Governmental activities for the year resulted in a
change in net position of $(7,917). Key elements of this change are as follows: 
Excess of revenues over (under) expenditures:
General fund
Internal service fund
General fund transfers from enterprise funds, net

change in net position of $(1,752). Key elements of this change are as follows: 
Water operations

The reduction in the net position primarily results from current year depreciation
(not funded in the rates) exceeding long-term debt principal payments (funded in
the rates).
D. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT’S FUNDS
As noted earlier, fund accounting is used to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements. 
Governmental funds. The focus of governmental funds is to provide information
on near-term inflows, outflows and balances of spendable resources. 
Such information is useful in assessing financing requirements. In particular, 
unassigned fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government’s net
resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal year. 
As of the end of the current fiscal year, governmental funds reported combined
ending fund balances of $38,182, a change of $9,072 in comparison to the prior
year.

The Town implemented Governmental Accounting Standards Board Statement
#54 Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions. In gen-
eral, amounts previously reported as undesignated fund balance, are now
reported as unassigned fund balance. Full definitions of all fund balance classi-
fications can be found in the notes to the financial statements. Additionally, 
amounts previously reported in stabilization and conservation funds, are now
required to be presented as committed fund balance in the general fund. 
The general fund is the chief operating fund. At the end of the current fiscal year, 
unassigned fund balance of the general fund was $24,264 (including $12,734 of
general stabilization funds), while total fund balance was $32,094. As a measure
of the general fund’s liquidity, it may be useful to compare both unassigned fund
balance and total fund balance to total general fund expenditures. Refer to the
table below.

Proprietary funds. Proprietary funds provide the same type of information found
in the business-type activities reported in the government-wide financial state-
ments, but in more detail. 
Unrestricted net position of the enterprise funds at the end of the year amounted
to $15,162, a decrease of $(1,556) from the prior year, mainly as a result of cur-
rent year depreciation expense in excess of paydowns on bonds. Other factors
concerning the finances of proprietary funds have already been addressed in the
entity-wide discussion of business-type activities. 
E. GENERAL FUND BUDGETARY HIGHLIGHTS
Differences between the original budget and the final amended budget resulted
in an overall change in appropriations of $2,519, due to a change in general gov-
ernment of $(4) public safety of $(101), education of $229, public works of
$1,092, human services of $23, culture and recreation of $133, employee bene-
fits of $(498), debt service of $(4), and transfers out of $1,649. The additional
appropriations were funded by the tax levy and transfers from other funds. 
Revenues in excess of budget mainly consist of bond premiums, and excise
revenues. 
F. CAPITAL ASSET AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION
Capital assets. Total investment in capital assets for governmental and business-
type activities at year-end, amounted to $391,729 (net of accumulated deprecia-
tion), a change of $8,285 from the prior year. This investment in capital assets
includes land, construction in progress, buildings and improvements, vehicles, 
machinery, equipment, and infrastructure.

year:

Significant capital asset activity for fiscal year 2014 included: 
  Sewer Improvements at Concord and School Streets were appropriated for
$5,557 and was substantially completed at the end of the fiscal year having
incurred $5,511 of expenditures. The design for wastewater pumping stations
projects, appropriated for $8,009 and started in the fall of 2007, has expended
$6,740. 
  At the 2008 Annual Town Meeting, the Town authorized over $21,000 in
water capital projects and $9,000 in sewer capital projects. $2107 has been
expended on Grove Street water pump station appropriated for $2,932. In
addition, $2,183 and $2,296 has been expended on the Prospect Street area
water and sewer main replacement projects, originally appropriated for $3,000
and $2,783 respectfully. 
  At the 2009 Annual Town Meeting, $40,337 was an appropriated to construct
the Birch Road water treatment center. The project proposes to re-activate the

RECONCILIATION OF THE STATEMENT OF REVENUES
EXPENDITURES, AND CHANGES IN FUND BALANCES OF
GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS TO THE STATEMENT OF ACTIVITIES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2014
Net changes in fund balances - Total governmental funds
Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures. However,
in the Statement of Activities the cost of those assets is allocated
over their estimated useful lives and reported as depreciation expense:
Capital outlay purchases, net of disposals
Depreciation
Revenues in the Statement of Activities that do not provide current
financial resources are fully deferred in the Statement of Revenues,
Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balances. Therefore, the
recognition of revenue for various types of accounts receivable
(i.e., real estate and personal property, motor vehicle excise, etc.)
differ between the two statements. This amount represents the
net change in deferred revenue.
Some revenues reported in the Statement of Activities, such as
MSBA reimbursements for contracted assistance, do not provide
current financial resources and therefore, are not reported as
revenues in the governmental funds.
The issuance of long-term debt (e.g., bonds and leases) provides
current financial resources to governmental funds, while the
repayment of the principal of long-term debt consumes the financial
resources of governmental funds. Neither transaction, however, 
has any effect on net position:
Proceeds from debt
Repayments of debt
Change in deferred debt amortization
In the Statement of Activities, interest is accrued on outstanding
long-term debt, whereas in governmental funds interest is not
reported until due.
Some expenses reported in the Statement of Activities, do not require
the use of current financial resources and therefore, are not reported
as expenditures in the governmental funds:
Increase in liability for compensated absences
Increase in net OPEB obligation
Increase in bond premium amortization
Internal service funds are used by management to account for health
insurance and workers' compensation activities. The net activity of
internal service funds is reported with Governmental Activities.
Change in net position of governmental activities

TOWN OF FRAMINGHAM, MASSACHUSETTS
Notes to Financial Statements
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies of the Town of Framingham (the Town) conform to
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as applicable to govern-
mental units. The following is a summary of the more significant policies: 
A. Reporting Entity
The government is a municipal corporation governed by an elected Board
of Selectmen. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, 
these financial statements present the government and applicable compo-
nent units for which the government is considered to be financially account-
able. In fiscal year 2014, it was determined that no entities met the required
GASB 14 (as amended) criteria of component units. 
In the Fiduciary Funds: The Framingham Contributory Retirement
System which was established to provide retirement benefits primarily
to employees and their beneficiaries. The System is presented using
the accrual basis of accounting and is reported as a pension trust fund
in the fiduciary fund financial statements. Additional financial informa-
tion of the System can be obtained by contacting the System located at
150 Concord Street, Framingham, MA 01702. 
B. Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements
Government-wide Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statements (i.e., the Statement of Net
Position and the Statement of Activities) report information on all of the
nonfiduciary activities of the primary government. For the most part, the
effect of interfund activity has been removed from these statements. 
Governmental activities, which normally are supported by taxes and
intergovernmental revenues, are reported separately from business-type
activities, which rely to a significant extent on fees and charges for
support. Likewise, the primary government is reported separately from
certain legally separate component units for which the primary govern-
ment is financially accountable. 
The Statement of Activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct
expenses of a given function or segment is offset by program revenues. 
Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific func-
tion or segment. Program revenues include (1) charges to customers or
applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or
privileges provided by a given function or segment and (2) grants and
28 
Page 31
contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital
requirements of a particular function or segment. Taxes and other items
not properly included among program revenues are reported instead as
general revenues.
Fund Financial Statements
Separate financial statements are provided for governmental funds, propri-
etary funds and fiduciary funds, even though the latter are excluded from
the government-wide financial statements. Major individual governmental
funds and major individual enterprise funds are reported as separate col-
umns in the fund financial statements. 
C. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement
Presentation
Government-wide Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic
resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as is
the proprietary fund and fiduciary fund financial statements. Revenues are
recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, 
regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized
as revenues in the year for which they are levied. Grants and similar items
are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by
the provider have been met. As a general rule, the effect of interfund activity
has been eliminated from the government- wide financial statements. 
Amounts reported as program revenues include (1) charges to customers
or applicants for goods, services, or privileges provided, (2) operating
grants and contributions, and (3) capital grants and contributions, includ-
ing special assessments. Internally dedicated resources are reported as
general revenues rather than as program revenues. Likewise, general
revenues include all taxes and excises. 
Fund Financial Statements
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current
financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of
accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measur-
able and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they
are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay
liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the government considers
property tax revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days
of the end of the current fiscal period. All other revenue items are consid-
ered to be measurable and available only when cash is received by the
government. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is
incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expendi-
tures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and
claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is due.

Page 32
The government reports the following major governmental funds: 
 The general fund is the government’s primary operating fund. 
It accounts for all financial resources of the general government, 
except those required to be accounted for in another fund. 
Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-
operating items. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from
providing services and producing and delivering goods in connection with
a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The principal operating
revenues of the enterprise fund are charges to customers for sales and
services. Operating expenses for enterprise funds include the cost of
sales and services, administrative expenses and depreciation on capital
assets. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported
as nonoperating revenues and expenses. 
The government reports the following major proprietary funds: 
 The water fund is used to report the Town’s water enterprise fund
operations. 
 The sewer fund is used to report the Town’s sewer enterprise fund
operations. 
The self-insured employee health program, reported as an internal service
fund in the accompanying financial statements, was converted from a self-
insurance program to the GIC insurance plan starting in fiscal year 2015. 
The remaining balance in the fund is to pay unanticipated run-off claims. 
The Other Post-employment Trust fund is used to accumulate resources
for health and life insurance benefits for retired employees. 
The pension trust fund accounts for the activities of the Employees
Contributory Retirement System, which accumulates resources for
pension benefit payments to qualified employees. 
The agency fund is custodial in nature and is used to account for funds
held for others. Agency funds report only assets and liabilities, and thus
have no measurement focus. 
D. Cash and Short-Term Investments
Cash balances from all funds, except those required to be segregated by
law, are combined to form a consolidation of cash. Cash balances are
invested to the extent available, and interest earnings are recognized in the
General Fund. Certain special revenue, proprietary, and fiduciary funds
segregate cash, and investment earnings become a part of those funds. 
30 
Page 33
Deposits with financial institutions consist primarily of demand deposits, 
certificates of deposits, and savings accounts. A cash and investment pool
is maintained that is available for use by all funds. Each fund’s portion of
this pool is reflected on the combined financial statements under the caption
“cash and short-term investments”. The interest earnings attributable to
each fund type were included under investment income. 
For purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows, the proprietary funds con-
sider investments with original maturities of three months or less to be
short-term investments. 
E. Investments
State and local statutes place certain limitations on the nature of deposits
and investments available. Deposits in any financial institution may not
exceed certain levels within the financial institution. Non-fiduciary fund
investments can be made in securities issued by or unconditionally guar-
anteed by the U.S. Government or agencies that have a maturity of one
year or less from the date of purchase and repurchase agreements guar-
anteed by such securities with maturity dates of no more than 90 days
from the date of purchase. 
Investments for the Contributory Retirement System are fully invested in
the Commonwealth’s Pension Reserve Investment Trust, and are carried
at fair value. 
F. Property Tax Limitations
Legislation known as “Proposition 2½” has limited the amount of revenue
that can be derived from property taxes. The prior fiscal year’s tax levy
limit is used as a base and cannot increase by more than 2.5 percent
(excluding new growth), unless an override is voted. The actual fiscal
year 2014 tax levy reflected an excess capacity of $3,446,821. 
G. Inventories
Inventories are valued at cost using the first-in/first-out (FIFO) method. 
The costs of governmental fund-type inventories are recorded as expendi-
tures when purchased rather than when consumed. No significant inven-
tory balances were on hand in governmental funds. 
H. Capital Assets
Capital assets, which include property, plant, equipment, and infra-
structure assets are reported in the applicable governmental or business-
type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements. Capi-
tal assets are defined by the government as assets with an initial individ-
ual cost of more than $5,000 and an estimated useful life in excess of two
years. Such assets are recorded at historical cost or estimated historical
31 
Page 34
cost if purchased or constructed. Donated capital assets are recorded at
estimated fair market value at the date of donation. 
The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value
of the asset or materially extend assets lives are not capitalized. 
Major outlays for capital assets and improvements are capitalized as pro-
jects are constructed. Interest incurred during the construction phase of
capital assets of business-type activities is included as part of the capital-
ized value of the assets constructed. 
Property, plant, equipment, and infrastructure of the primary government, 
as well as the component units, are depreciated using the straight-line
method over the following estimated useful lives: 
Assets  Years
Buildings
Building improvements
Infrastructure
Vehicles
Machinery, equipment and furnishings
Computer equipment

I. Compensated Absences
It is the government’s policy to permit employees to accumulate earned
but unused vacation and sick pay benefits. All vested sick and vacation
pay is accrued when incurred in the government-wide, proprietary, and
fiduciary fund financial statements. A liability for these amounts is reported
in governmental funds only if they have matured, for example, as a result
of employee resignations and retirements. 
J. Long-Term Obligations
In the government-wide financial statements, and proprietary fund types
in the fund financial statements, long-term debt, and other long-term
obligations are reported as liabilities in the applicable governmental
activities, business-type activities, or proprietary fund type Statement of
Net Position. 
K. Fund Equity
Fund equity at the governmental fund financial reporting level is classified
as “fund balance”. Fund equity for all other reporting is classified as “net
position”. 
32 
Page 35
Fund Balance - Generally, fund balance represents the difference
between the current assets and current liabilities. The Town reserves
those portions of fund balance that are legally segregated for a specific
future use or which do not represent available, spendable resources and
therefore, are not available for appropriation or expenditure. Unassigned
fund balance indicates that portion of fund balance that is available for
appropriation in future periods. 
The Town’s fund balance classification policies and procedures are as
follows: 
1) Nonspendable funds are either unspendable in the current form
(i.e., inventory, petty cash, or prepaid items) or can never be spent
(i.e., perpetual care).
2) Restricted funds are used solely for the purpose in which the fund
was established. In the case of special revenue funds, these funds
are created by statute or otherwise have external constraints on
how the funds can be expended. 
3) Committed funds are reported and expended as a result of motions
passed by the highest decision making authority in the government
(i.e., Town Meeting).
4) Assigned funds are used for specific purposes as established by
management. These funds, which include encumbrances, have
been assigned for specific goods and services ordered but not yet
paid for. This account also includes fund balance voted to be used
in the subsequent fiscal year. 
5) Unassigned funds are available to be spent in future periods. 
When an expenditure is incurred that would qualify for payment from multi-
ple fund balance types, the Town uses the following order to liquidate lia-
bilities: restricted, committed, assigned, and unassigned. 
Net Position - Net position represents the difference between assets/ 
deferred outflows and liabilities/deferred inflows. Net investment in capital
assets, net of related debt, consist of capital assets, net of accumulated
depreciation, reduced by the outstanding balances of any borrowing used
for the acquisition, construction or improvement of those assets. Net
position is reported as restricted when there are limitations imposed on
their use either through the enabling legislation adopted by the Town or
through external restrictions imposed by creditors, grantors, or laws or
regulations of other governments. The remaining net position is reported
as unrestricted. 
33 
Page 36
L. Use of Estimates
The preparation of basic financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures for contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the basic
financial statements, and the reported amounts of the revenues and
expenditures/expenses during the fiscal year. Actual results could vary
from estimates that were used. 
2. Stewardship, Compliance, and Accountability
A. Budgetary Information
At the annual town meeting, the Chief Financial Officer presents an oper-
ating and capital budget for the proposed expenditures of the fiscal year
commencing the following July 1. The budget, as enacted by town meet-
ing, establishes the legal level of control and specifies that certain appro-
priations are to be funded by particular revenues. The original budget is
amended during the fiscal year at special town meetings as required by
changing conditions. In cases of extraordinary or unforeseen expenses, 
the Finance Committee is empowered to transfer funds from the Reserve
Fund (a contingency appropriation) to a departmental appropriation. 
“Extraordinary” includes expenses which are not in the usual line, or are
great or exceptional. “Unforeseen” includes expenses which are not fore-
seen as of the time of the annual meeting when appropriations are voted. 
Departments are limited to the line items as voted. Certain items may
exceed the line item budget as approved if it is for an emergency and for
the safety of the general public. These items are limited by the Massa-
chusetts General Laws and must be raised in the next year’s tax rate. 
Formal budgetary integration is employed as a management control
device during the year for the General Fund and Proprietary Funds. Effec-
tive budgetary control is achieved for all other funds through provisions of
the Massachusetts General Laws. 
At year-end, appropriation balances lapse, except for certain unexpended
capital items and encumbrances which will be honored during the subse-
quent year. 
B. Budgetary Basis
The General Fund final appropriation appearing on the “Budget and
Actual” page of the fund financial statements represents the final amended
budget after all reserve fund transfers and supplemental appropriations. 
34 
Page 37
C. Budget/GAAP Reconciliation
The budgetary data for the general and proprietary funds is based upon
accounting principles that differ from generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples (GAAP). Therefore, in addition to the GAAP basis financial state-
ments, the results of operations of the general fund are presented in
accordance with budgetary accounting principles to provide a meaningful
comparison to budgetary data. 
The following is a summary of adjustments made to the actual revenues
and other sources, and expenditures and other uses, to conform to the
budgetary basis of accounting.

The deficits in these funds will be eliminated through future departmental
revenues, bond proceeds, and transfers from other funds. 
3. Cash and Short-Term Investments
Custodial Credit Risk - Deposits. Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the
event of a bank failure, the Town’s and Contributory Retirement System’s
(the System) deposits may not be returned. Massachusetts General Law
Chapter 44, Section 55, limits the Town’s deposits “in a bank or trust
company or banking company to an amount not exceeding sixty percent of
the capital and surplus of such bank or trust company or banking company, 
unless satisfactory security is given to it by such bank or trust company or
banking company for such excess.” The Town’s deposit policy for custodial
credit risk is to limit unsecured bank deposits to no more than 5% of the
institution’s assets and no more than 10% of the municipality’s cash. 
Massachusetts General Law Chapter 32, Section 23, limits the System’s
deposits “in a bank or trust company to an amount not exceeding ten percent
of the capital and surplus of such bank or trust company.” The System does
not have a deposit policy for custodial credit risk. 
As of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, $26,767,151 and $1,190,968
of the Town’s and System’s bank balances of $79,302,134 and $1,613,979
respectively, was exposed to custodial credit risk as uninsured or
uncollateralized. 
Of the Town’s balance exposed to custodial credit risk, $14,923,322 is on
deposit with Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust. 
Of the System’s balance exposed to custodial credit risk, $1,014,164 is on
deposit with the Pension Reserve Investment Trust and $176,804 is on
deposit with Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust. 
4. Investments
A. Credit Risk
Generally, credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not
fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment. For short-term invest-
ments that were purchased using surplus revenues, Massachusetts
General Law, Chapter 44, Section 55, limits the Town’s investments to the
top rating issued by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating
organization (NRSROs).

Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 32, Section 23, limits the invest-
ment of System funds, to the extent not required for current disburse-
ments, in the PRIT Fund or in securities, other than mortgages or collat-
eral loans, which are legal for the investment of funds in savings banks
under the laws of the Commonwealth, provided that no more than the
established percentage of assets, is invested in any one security. 
At December 31, 2013, the Contributory Retirement System maintained its
investments in the State Investment Pool* with a fair value of $242,598,940. 
This investment type is not rated. 
*Fair value is the same as the value of the pool share. The Pension Reserves Investment
Trust was created under Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 32, Section 22, in
December 1983. The Pension Reserves Investment Trust is operated under contract with
a private investment advisor, approved by the Pension Reserves Investment Manage-
ment Board. The Pension Reserves Investment Management Board shall choose an
investment advisor by requesting proposals from advisors and reviewing such proposals
based on criteria adopted under Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 30B. 
B. Custodial Credit Risk
The custodial credit risk for investments is the risk that, in the event of the
failure of the counterparty (e.g., broker-dealer) to a transaction, a govern-
ment will not be able to recover the value of its investment or collateral
securities that are in the possession of another party. The Town’s policy
for custodial credit risk is to limit investments to the state investment pool, 
U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. Agency obligations, and certificates of
deposit. The System does not have policies for custodial credit risk. 
The Town’s investments were exposed to custodial credit risk because the
related securities are uninsured, unregistered, and/or held by the Town’s
brokerage firm, which is also the Counterparty to these securities. The
Town manages this custodial credit risk with SIPC and excess SIPC. 
38 
Page 41
The System’s investments were exposed to custodial credit risk as unin-
sured and uncollateralized. However, these investments were held in the
State Investment Pool. 
C. Concentration of Credit Risk
The Town’s policy for concentration of credit risk is to limit investments in
a single financial institution to no more than 10% of the Town’s invest-
ments with the exception of U.S. Treasury obligations or investments fully
collateralized by U.S. Treasuries or agencies, and state pools. 
The Town’s investments in any one issuer (other than U.S. Treasury
securities and mutual funds) that represent 5% or more of total invest-
ments, was $1,345,520 held in Federal Home Loan Bank notes. 
Massachusetts General Law Chapter 32, Section 23 limits the amount the
System may invest in any one issuer or security type, with the exception of
the PRIT Fund. 
The Contributory Retirement System does not have an investment in one
issuer greater than 5% of total investments. 
D. Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will
adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Generally, the longer
the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value
to changes in market interest rates. The Town’s policy for interest rate risk
is to structure the portfolio so securities mature to meet all operating
requirements that may be reasonably anticipated, thus avoiding the need
to sell securities on the open market prior to maturity. The System does
not have a formal investment policy that limits investment maturities as a
means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increas-
ing interest rates. 
Information about the sensitivity of the fair values of the Town’s invest-
ments to market interest rate fluctuations is as follows (in thousands):

The Retirement system does not maintain investments that are sensitive
to market interest rate fluctuations. 
E. Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates
will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. The Town and System
do not have policies for foreign currency risk. 
5. Taxes Receivable
Real estate and personal property taxes are levied and based on values
assessed on January 1st of every year. Assessed values are established by
the Board of Assessor’s for 100% of the estimated fair market value. Taxes
are due on a quarterly basis and are subject to penalties and interest if they
are not paid by the respective due date. Real estate and personal property
taxes levied are recorded as receivables in the fiscal year they relate to. 
Fourteen days after the due date for the final tax bill for real estate taxes, a
demand notice may be sent to the delinquent taxpayer. Fourteen days after
the demand notice has been sent, the tax collector may proceed to file a lien
against the delinquent taxpayers’ property. The Town has an ultimate right to
foreclose on property for unpaid taxes. Personal property taxes cannot be
secured through the lien process. 
Taxes receivable at June 30, 2014 consist of the following (in thousands):

E. Legal Debt Margin
The Town is subject to the General Laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts which, in general, limits the amount of bonded debt
the Town may have outstanding to 5 percent of the valuation of taxable
property as last equalized by the Commonwealth’s Department of
Revenue. The following is a computation of the legal debt margin as
of June 30, 2014 (in thousands):
Revised equalized valuation - FY2014  $ 7,611,238
Debt limit - 5% of equalized valuation  $  380,562

Legal Debt Margin  $  281,704 *
* Excludes bond anticipation notes and authorized but unissued debt.
F. Debt Refunding
Prior Year
In the prior year, the Town defeased various bond issues by creating
separate irrevocable trust funds. The proceeds from the new issuance of
the general obligation bonds were used to purchase U.S. government
securities, and those securities were deposited in an irrevocable trust with
an escrow agent to provide debt service payments until the refunded
bonds mature in March 2015. For financial reporting purposes, the debt
has been considered defeased, and therefore, removed as a liability from
the Town’s balance sheet. As of June 30, 2014, the amount of defeased
debt outstanding but removed from the governmental activities and
business-type activities was $880,000.

16. Restricted Net Position
The accompanying entity-wide financial statements report restricted net
position when external constraints from grantors or contributors are placed
on net position. 
Permanent fund restricted net position is segregated between nonexpendable
and expendable. The nonexpendable portion represents the original restricted
principal contribution, and the expendable represents accumulated earnings
which are available to be spent based on donor restrictions. 
17. Governmental Funds - Balances
Fund balances are segregated to account for resources that are either not
available for expenditure in the future or are legally set aside for a specific
future use. 
The Town implemented GASB Statement No. 54 (GASB 54), Fund Balance
Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions, which enhances the
usefulness of fund balance information by providing clearer fund balance
classifications that can be more consistently applied and by clarifying existing
governmental fund type definitions. 
The following types of fund balances are reported at June 30, 2014: 
Nonspendable - Represents amounts that cannot be spent because they
are either (a) not in spendable form or (b) legally or contractually required to
be maintained intact. This fund balance classification includes general fund
reserves for prepaid expenditures, petty cash, and nonmajor governmental
fund reserves for the principal portion of permanent trust funds. 
Restricted - Represents amounts that are restricted to specific purposes by
constraints imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations
of other governments, or constraints imposed by law through constitutional
provisions or enabling legislation. This fund balance classification includes
general fund encumbrances funded by bond issuances, various special
revenue funds, and the income portion of permanent trust funds. 
Committed - Represents amounts that can only be used for specific pur-
poses pursuant to constraints imposed by formal action of the Town’s highest
level of decision-making authority. This fund balance classification includes
general fund encumbrances for non-lapsing, special article appropriations
approved at Town Meeting, stabilization funds set aside by Town Meeting
vote for future capital acquisitions and improvements (now reported as part of
the general fund per GASB 54), and various special revenue funds. 
Assigned - Represents amounts that are constrained by the Town’s intent to
use these resources for a specific purpose. This fund balance classification
includes general fund encumbrances that have been established by various
51 
Page 54
Town departments for the expenditure of current year budgetary financial
resources upon vendor performance in the subsequent budgetary period. 
Unassigned - Represents amounts that are available to be spent in future
periods.

18. General Fund Unassigned Fund Balance
The unassigned general fund balance reported on the balance sheet is stated
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which
differs in certain respects from the Massachusetts Uniform Municipal Account-
ing System (UMAS). The following paragraphs summarize the major differ-
ences. 
Massachusetts General Laws include provisions to allow municipalities to over-
expend certain appropriations if they are incurred in an emergency situation
and for the safety of the public. The most common example involves the “snow
and ice” appropriation. All such overexpenditures, however, must be funded in
the subsequent year’s tax rate. 
The accompanying financial statements include an estimate for future poten-
tial tax refunds, which is not recognized under UMAS. 
The following summarizes the specific differences between GAAP basis and
budgetary basis of reporting the general fund unassigned fund balance:

20. Commitments and Contingencies
Outstanding Legal Issues - There are several pending legal issues in which
the Town is involved. The Town’s management is of the opinion that the
potential future settlement of such claims would not materially affect its finan-
cial statements taken as a whole. 
Grants - Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to
audit and adjustment by grantor agencies, principally the federal government. 
Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute
a liability of the applicable funds. The amount of expenditures which may
be disallowed by the grantor cannot be determined at this time, although the
Town expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 
Abatements - There are several cases pending before the Appellate Tax
Board in regard to alleged discrepancies in property assessments. According
to the Town’s counsel, the probable outcome of these cases at the present
time is indeterminable. 
21. Post-Employment Healthcare and Life Insurance Benefits
Other Post-Employment Benefits
GASB Statement 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for
Post-Employment Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires governments to
account for other post-employment benefits (OPEB), primarily healthcare, 
on an accrual basis rather than on a pay-as-you-go basis. The effect is the
recognition of an actuarially required contribution as an expense on the
Statement of Activities when a future retiree earns their post-employment
benefits, rather than when they use their post-employment benefit. To the
extent that an entity does not fund their actuarially required contribution, a
post-employment benefit liability is recognized on the Statement of Net
Position over time. 
54 
Page 57
A. Plan Description
In addition to providing the pension benefits described, the Town pro- 
vides post-employment healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired
employees through the Town’s plan. The benefits, benefit levels, employee
contributions and employer contributions are governed by Chapter 32 of the
Massachusetts General Laws. As of July 1, 2014, the actuarial valuation
date, approximately 1,495 retirees and 1,695 active employees meet the
eligibility requirements. The plan does not issue a separate financial report. 
B. Benefits Provided
The Town provides medical, prescription drug, mental health/substance
abuse and life insurance to retirees and their covered dependents. All
active employees who retire from the Town and meet the eligibility criteria
will receive these benefits. 
C. Funding Policy
Retirees contribute various percentages of the cost of the health plan, as
determined by the Town. The Town contributes the remainder of the
health plan costs on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
D. Annual OPEB Costs and Net OPEB Obligation
The Town’s fiscal 2014 annual OPEB expense is calculated based on the
annual required contribution of the employer (ARC), an amount actuarially
determined in accordance with the parameters of GASB Statement No. 45. 
The ARC represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing basis, is
projected to cover the normal cost per year and amortize the unfunded
actuarial liability over a period of thirty years. The following table shows the
components of the Town’s annual OPEB cost for the year ending June 30, 
2014, the amount actually contributed to the plan, and the change in the
Town’s net OPEB obligation based on an actuarial valuation as of July 1, 
2014.

E. Funded Status and Funding Progress
The funded status of the plan as of July 1, 2014, the date of the most
recent actuarial valuation was as follows: 
Actuarial accrued liability (AAL)
Actuarial value of plan assets (7/1/14)
Unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL)
Funded ratio (actuarial value of plan assets/AAL)
Covered payroll (active plan members)

(2,516,635)
$ 286,128,910 
0.9%
$ 111,670,636 
256%
Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of
reported amount and assumptions about the probability of occurrence of
events far into the future. Examples included assumptions about future
employment, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend. Amounts deter-
mined regarding the funded status of the plan and the annual required
contributions of the employer are subject to continual revision as actual
results are compared with past expectations and new estimates are made
about the future. The schedule of funding progress, presented as required
supplementary information following the notes to the financial statements, 
presents multiyear trend information that shows whether the actuarial
value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to the
actuarial accrued liabilities for benefits. 
F. Actuarial Methods and Assumptions
Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the
plan as understood by the Town and the plan members and include the
types of benefits provided at the time of each valuation and the historical
56 
Page 59
pattern of sharing of benefit costs between the Town and plan members
to that point. The actuarial methods and assumptions used include tech-
niques that are designed to reduce short-term volatility in actuarial accrued
liabilities and the actuarial value of assets, consistent with the long-term
perspective of the calculations. 
In the July 1, 2014 actuarial valuation the projected unit credit cost method
was used. The actuarial value of assets was not determined as the Town
has not advance funded its obligation. The actuarial assumptions included a
4% investment rate of return and an initial annual healthcare cost trend rate
of 8% which decreases to a 5% long-term rate for all healthcare benefits
after five years. The amortization costs for the initial UAAL is a level per-
centage of payroll for a period of 30 years, on an open basis. This has been
calculated assuming the amortization payment increases at a rate of 4.0%.
22. Contributory Retirement System
The Town follows the provisions of GASB Statement No. 27, Accounting for
Pensions for State and Local Government Employees, (as amended by
GASB 50) with respect to the employees’ retirement funds. 
A. Plan Description and Contribution Information
Substantially all employees of the Town (except teachers and administra-
tors under contract employed by the School Department) are members of
the Framingham Contributory Retirement System (FCRS), a cost sharing, 
multiple employer defined benefit PERS. Eligible employees must partici-
pate in the FCRS. The pension plan provides pension benefits, deferred
allowances, and death and disability benefits. Chapter 32 of the Massa-
chusetts General Laws establishes the authority of the FCRS Retirement
Board. Chapter 32 also establishes contribution percentages and benefits
paid. The FCRS Retirement Board does not have the authority to amend
benefit provisions. As required by Massachusetts General Laws, the
System issues a separate report to the Commonwealth’s Public Employee
Retirement Administration Commission. 
Membership of each plan consisted of the following at December 31, 2013: 
Retirees and beneficiaries receiving benefits
Terminated plan members entitled to but not yet
receiving benefits
Active plan members

Employee contribution percentages are specified in Chapter 32 of the
Massachusetts General Laws. The percentage is determined by the
participant’s date of entry into the system. All employees hired after
January 1, 1979 contribute an additional 2% on all gross regular earnings
over the rate of $30,000 per year. The percentages are as follows: 
Before January 1, 1975
January 1, 1975 - December 31, 1983
January 1, 1984 - June 30, 1996

B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Accounting - Contributory retirement system financial statements
are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Plan member contri-
butions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are due. 
Employer contributions are recognized when due and the employer has
made a formal commitment to provide the contributions. Benefits and
refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the
terms of the plan. 
Method Used to Value Investments - Investments are reported at fair
value in accordance with PERAC requirements.

The Schedule of Funding Progress following the notes to the financial
statements presents multi-year trend information about the actuarial value
of plan assets relative to the actuarial accrued liability for benefits. 
D. Actuarial Methods and Assumptions
The annual required contribution for the current year was determined as
part of the actuarial valuation using the entry age normal actuarial cost
method. Under this method an unfunded actuarial accrued liability of
$101.4 million was calculated. The actuarial assumptions included (a) 8% 
investment rate of return and (b) a projected salary increase of 4.75 - 5.25% 
per year. Liabilities for cost of living increases have been assumed at an
annual increase of 3%, on the first $12,000 of benefit payments. The
actuarial value of assets is determined by projecting the market value of
assets as of the beginning of the prior plan year with the assumed rate of
return during that year (8%) and accounting for deposits and disbursements
with interest at the assumed rate of return. An adjustment is then applied to
recognize the difference between the actual investment return and expected
return over a five-year period. As of December 31, 2013, the unfunded
actuarially accrued liability is being amortized over 17 years using a 5.00% 
annual increasing basis. 
E. Teachers
As required by State statutes, teachers of the Town are covered by the
Massachusetts Teachers Retirement System (MTRS). The MTRS is
funded by contributions from covered employees and the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts. The Town is not required to contribute. All persons
employed on at least a half-time basis, who are covered under a contrac-
tual agreement requiring certification by the Board of Education are eligi-
ble, and must participate in the MTRS. 
Based on the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ retirement laws, employ-
ees covered by the pension plan must contribute a percentage of gross
earnings into the pension fund. The percentage is determined by the
59 
Page 62
participant’s date of entry into the system and gross earnings, up to
$30,000, as follows: 
Before January 1, 1975
January 1, 1975 - December 31, 1983
January 1, 1984 - June 30, 1996
July 1, 1996 - June 30, 2001
Beginning July 1, 2001 
5%
7% *
8% *
9% *
11%
*Effective January 1, 1990, all participants hired after January 1, 1979, 
who have not elected to increase to 11%, contribute an additional 2% of
salary in excess of $30,000. 
The Town’s current year covered payroll for teachers and administrators
was unavailable. 
In fiscal year 2014, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts contributed
$21,232,607 to the MTRS on behalf of the Town. This is included in the
education expenditures and intergovernmental revenues in the general
fund. 
23. Self-insurance
The Town self-insures against claims for workers compensation, unemploy-
ment and most employee health coverage. Annual estimated requirements for
claims are provided in the Town’s annual operating budget. 
Health Insurance
The Town contracts with an insurance carrier for excess liability coverage
and an insurance consultant for claims processing. Under the terms of its
insurance coverage, the Town is liable for claims up to $150,000 per incident, 
with a maximum lifetime coverage of $2,000,000. The claims liability repre-
sents an estimate of claims incurred but unpaid at year-end, based on past
historical costs and claims paid subsequent to year-end. 
Changes in the aggregate liability for claims for the year ended June 30, 2014
are as follows: 
60 
Page 63
Claims liability, beginning of year
Claims incurred/recognized
in fiscal year 2014

Health
Coverage
$  6,318,478
43,777,708
(45,874,138)
$  4,222,048 
The $4,222,048 estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported includes
only an estimate for known loss events expected to later be presented as
claims. The Town is unable to estimate the amount of unknown loss events
expected to become claims and expected future developments on claims
already reported. 
24. Risk Management
The Town is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage
to and destruction of assets; errors and omissions; and natural disasters for
which the government carries commercial insurance. There were no signifi-
cant reductions in insurance coverage from the previous year and have been
no material settlements in excess of coverage in any of the past three fiscal
years. 
25. Implementation of New GASB Standards
The GASB has issued Statement No. 68 Accounting and Financial Reporting
for Pensions, which is required to be implemented in fiscal year 2015. Manage-
ment’s current assessment is that this pronouncement will have a significant
impact on the Town’s basic financial statements by recognizing as a liability
and expense, the Town’s applicable portion of the Town of Framingham
Contributory Retirement System’s actuarially accrued liability.
