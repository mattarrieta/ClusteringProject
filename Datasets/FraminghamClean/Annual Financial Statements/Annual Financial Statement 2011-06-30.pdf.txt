INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
To the Board of Selectmen 
Town of Framingham, Massachusetts 
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activi-
ties, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining
fund information of the Town of Framingham, Massachusetts, as of and for the year
ended June 30, 2011, (except for the Framingham Contributory Retirement System
which is as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010) which collectively com-
prise the Town’s basic financial statements as listed in the Table of Contents. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Town of Framingham’s manage-
ment. Our responsibility is to expre ss an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audit. 
We conducted our audit in accordance wit h auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits
contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General
of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whet her the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made 
by management, as well as evaluating the ov erall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions. 
In our opinion, the financial statements refe rred to above present fairly, in all mate- 
rial respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, the
business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund infor-
mation of the Town of Framingham, as of June 30, 2011, (except the Framingham
Contributory Retirement System which is as of December 31, 2010), and the respec-
tive changes in financial position and cash flows, where applicable, thereof and the
respective budgetary comparison for the General Fund for the year then ended in
conformity with accounting principles gener ally accepted in the United States of
America.

The Management’s Discussion and Analysis, appearing on the following pages, 
and the supplementary information appearing on page 59, are not a required part
of the basic financial statements but are supplementary information required by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We
have applied certain limited procedures, which consisted principally of inquiries of
management regarding the methods of measurement and presentation of the
required supplementary information. However, we did not audit the information
and express no opinion on it. 
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued a report
dated March 15, 2012 on our consideration of the Town’s internal control over finan-
cial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regu-
lations, contracts and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that
report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial report-
ing and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on
the internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an inte-
gral part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards 
and should be considered in assessing the results of our audit.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
As management of the Town of Framingham, we offer readers this narrative over-
view and analysis of the financial activities of the Town of Framingham for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2011. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts reported in this
analysis are expressed in thousands. 
A. OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the basic
financial statements. The basic financial statements are comprised of three
components: (1) government-wide financial statements, (2) fund financial state-
ments, and (3) notes to financial statements. This report also contains other
supplementary information in addition to the basic financial statements them-
selves. 
Government-wide financial statements. The government-wide financial state-
ments are designed to provide readers with a broad overview of our finances in
a manner similar to a private-sector business. 
The Statement of Net Assets presents information on all assets and liabilities, 
with the difference between the two reported as net assets. Over time, increases
or decreases in net assets may serve as a useful indicator of whether the finan-
cial position is improving or deteriorating. 
The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the government’s
net assets changed during the most recent fiscal year. All changes in net assets
are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change occurs, 
regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, revenues and expenses
are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in cash flows
in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected taxes and earned but unused vacation
leave).
Both of the government-wide financial statements distinguish functions that are
principally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues (governmental
activities) from other functions that are intended to recover all or a significant
portion of their costs through user fees and charges (business-type activities).
The governmental activities include general government, public safety, educa-
tion, public works, health and human services, and culture and recreation. The
business-type activities include water and sewer activities. 
Fund financial statements. A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is
used to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific
activities or objectives. Fund accounting is used to ensure and demonstrate
compliance with finance-related legal requirements. All of the funds can be
3
Page 6
divided into three categories: governmental funds, proprietary funds and fiduci-
ary funds. 
Governmental funds. Governmental funds are used to account for essentially
the same functions reported as governmental activities in the government-wide
financial statements. However, unlike the government-wide financial statements, 
governmental fund financial statements focus on near-term inflows and outflows
of spendable resources, as well as on balances of spendable resources available
at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in evaluating a gov-
ernment’s near-term financing requirements. 
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-
wide financial statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for
governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities
in the government-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better
understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing deci-
sions. Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund
statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances provide a
reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and
governmental activities. 
An annual appropriated budget is adopted for the general fund. A budgetary
comparison statement has been provided for the general fund to demonstrate
compliance with this budget. 
Proprietary funds. Proprietary funds are maintained as follows: 
Enterprise funds are used to report the same functions presented as business-
type activities in the government-wide financial statements. Specifically, 
enterprise funds are used to account for water and sewer operations. 
Internal service funds are an accounting device used to accumulate and allocate
costs internally among various functions. Specifically, internal service funds are
used to account for self-insured employee health programs. Because these ser-
vices predominantly benefit governmental rather than business-type functions, 
they have been included within governmental activities in the government-wide
financial statements. 
Proprietary funds provide the same type of information as the business-type
activities reported in the government-wide financial statements, only in more
detail. The proprietary fund financial statements provide separate information
for the water and sewer operations, both of which are considered to be major
funds. 
Fiduciary funds. Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the
benefit of parties outside the government. Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the
government-wide financial statements because the resources of those funds are
4
Page 7
not available to support the Town’s own programs. The accounting used for
fiduciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds. 
Notes to financial statements. The notes provide additional information that is
essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the government-wide and
fund financial statements. 
Other information. In addition to the basic financial statements and accom-
panying notes, this report also presents certain required supplementary infor-
mation which is required to be disclosed by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

As noted earlier, net assets may serve over time as a useful indicator of a
government’s financial position. At the close of the most recent fiscal year, total
net assets were $ 198,892, a change of $ (3,171) from the prior year. 
The largest portion of net assets, $ 175,445 reflects our investment in capital
assets (e.g., land, construction in progress, buildings and improvements, vehi-
cles, machinery, equipment, and infrastructure); less any related debt used to
acquire those assets that is still outstanding. These capital assets are used to
provide services to citizens; consequently, these assets are not available for
future spending. Although the investment in capital assets is reported net of
related debt, it should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt
must be provided from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot
be used to liquidate these liabilities. 
An additional portion of net assets, $ 11,600 represents resources that are sub-
ject to external restrictions on how they may be used. The remaining balance
of unrestricted net assets, $ 11,847 may be used to meet the government’s
ongoing obligations to citizens and creditors.

Governmental activities. Governmental activities for the year resulted in a
change in net assets of $ (11,196).  Key elements of this change are as follows: 
Excess of revenues over(under) expenditures:
General fund
Special revenue funds
General fund transfers from enterprise funds, net
Subtotal
Capital assets acquired with current year revenues
Depreciation in excess of debt service principal paydown

D. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT’S FUNDS
As noted earlier, fund accounting is used to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements. 
Governmental funds. The focus of governmental funds is to provide infor-
mation on near-term inflows, outflows and balances of spendable resources. 
Such information is useful in assessing financing requirements. In particular, 
unassigned fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government’s net
resources available for spending at the end of the fiscal year. 
As of the end of the current fiscal year, governmental funds reported combined
ending fund balances of $ 25,048, a change of $ 12,967 in comparison to the
prior year. 
In fiscal year 2011, the Town implemented Governmental Accounting Standards
Board Statement #54 Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type
Definitions.  In general, amounts previously reported as undesignated fund
8
Page 11
balance, are now reported as unassigned fund balance. Full definitions of all
fund balance classifications can be found in the notes to the financial statements. 
Additionally, amounts previously reported in stabilization and conservation funds, 
are now required to be presented as committed fund balance in the general fund. 
The general fund is the chief operating fund. At the end of the current fiscal year, 
unassigned fund balance of the general fund was $ 3,261, while total fund bal-
ance was $ 13,728. As a measure of the general fund’s liquidity, it may be useful
to compare both unassigned fund balance and total fund balance to total general
fund expenditures. Refer to the table below.

Proprietary funds. Proprietary funds provide the same type of information
found in the business-type activities reported in the government-wide financial
statements, but in more detail. 
Unrestricted net assets of the enterprise funds at the end of the year amounted
to $ 29,747. Other factors concerning the finances of proprietary funds have
already been addressed in the entity-wide discussion of business-type activities. 
E. GENERAL FUND BUDGETARY HIGHLIGHTS
Differences between the original budget and the final amended budget resulted
in an overall change in appropriations of $ 74, due to a change in General
Government of $ (702), Public Safety of $ 367, Education of $ 22, Public Works
of $ 419, Culture and Recreation of $ 35, and Employee Benefits of $ (67).  The
additional appropriations were funded by transfers from other funds. 
F. CAPITAL ASSET AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION
Capital assets. Total investment in capital assets for governmental and business-
type activities at year-end, amounted to $ 336,183 (net of accumulated deprecia-
tion), a change of $ 37,444 from the prior year. This investment in capital assets
includes land, construction in progress, buildings and improvements, vehicles, 
machinery, equipment, and infrastructure.

Framingham. The project will provide the Town with an independent and
dependable source of drinking water. The Town has been working with the
United States Geological Survey (USGS) to refine a sophisticated ground-
water model. Since 2004, the Town had previously appropriated $ 5,130 and
expended $ 6,216 on studies and design on this project. 
•  To comply with the Administrative Consent Order issued by the Department
of Environmental Protection and Settlement Agreement with the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, $ 40,407 was voted to reconfig-
ure the sewer system in East Framingham. This project has been approved
11 
Page 14
for $ 38,066 in loans from Clean Water State Revolving Fund loan program. 
Construction is to be completed over three phases with an estimated comple-
tion during the spring of 2012. $ 19,576 has been expended to date on
Phase I. 
•  The Town received authorization of $ 12,900 in grant funds from
Massachusetts Life Science Center for improvements to Water and Sewer
infrastructure and the Pleasant Street Pump Station in the Technology Park
area. $ 8,554 has been expended on these projects. 
•  At the 2010 Annual Town Meeting, $ 17,967 was voted for additional Water
Capital Projects. $ 870 has been expended from the $ 9,619 appropriated for
North Concord Street Water Mains. $ 41 has been expended from the
$ 6,263 appropriation for Grant and Pond Street project. The Goodnow Pump
Station authorized for $ 1,385 has not started. In addition, $ 7,402 was
appropriated for Sewer Projects of which $ 6,552 was for Sewer Lines in the
Grant and Pond Street Area. $ 1,455 has been expended on this project. At
the 2011 Annual Town Meeting, $1 ,700 was authorized for Roadway
Improvements, $ 2,680 and $ 1,765 for Downtown Water and Sewer Utilities
respectively; as well as $ 6,310 for the North Framingham and $ 925
Worcester Road Pump Stations.

RECONCILIATION OF THE STATEMENT OF REVENUES
EXPENDITURES, AND CHANGES IN FUND BALANCES OF
GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS TO THE STATEMENT OF ACTIVITIES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2011
NET CHANGES IN FUND BALANCES - TOTAL GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS
Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures. However,
in the Statement of Activities the cost of those assets is allocated
over their estimated useful lives and reported as depreciation expense:
Capital outlay purchases, net of disposals
Depreciation
Revenues in the Statement of Activities that do not provide current
financial resources are fully deferred in the Statement of Revenues,
Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balances. Therefore, the
recognition of revenue for various types of accounts receivable
(i.e., real estate and personal property, motor vehicle excise, etc.)
differ between the two statements. This amount represents the
net change in deferred revenue.
Some revenues reported in the Statement of Activities, such as
MSBA reimbursements for contracted assistance, do not provide
current financial resources and therefore, are not reported as
revenues in the governmental funds.
The issuance of long-term debt (e.g., bonds and leases) provides
current financial resources to governmental funds, while the
repayment of the principal of long-term debt consumes the financial
resources of governmental funds. Neither transaction, however, 
has any effect on net assets:
Issuance of debt
Repayments of debt
Deferred debt amortization
In the statement of activities, interest is accrued on outstanding
long-term debt, whereas in governmental funds interest is not
reported until due.
Some expenses reported in the Statement of Activities, do not require
the use of current financial resources and therefore, are not reported
as expenditures in the governmental funds:
Increase in liability for compensated absences
Increase in net OPEB obligation
Internal service funds are used by management to account for health
insurance and workers' compensation activities. The net activity of
internal service funds is reported with Governmental Activities.

TOWN OF FRAMINGHAM, MASSACHUSETTS
Notes to Financial Statements
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies of the Town of Framingham (the Town) conform to
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as applicable to govern-
mental units. The following is a summary of the more significant policies: 
A. Reporting Entity
The government is a municipal corporation governed by an elected Board
of Selectmen. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, 
these financial statements present the government and applicable compo-
nent units for which the government is considered to be financially
accountable. 
In the Fiduciary Funds: The Framingham Contributory Retirement
System which was established to provide retirement benefits primarily
to employees and their beneficiaries. The System is presented using
the accrual basis of accounting and is reported as a pension trust fund
in the fiduciary fund financial statements. Additional financial informa-
tion of the System can be obtained by contacting the System located at
150 Concord Street, Framingham, MA 01702. 
B. Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements
Government-wide Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statements (i.e., the Statement of Net
Assets and the Statement of Changes in Net Assets) report information
on all of the nonfiduciary activities of the primary government. For the
most part, the effect of interfund activity has been removed from these
statements. Governmental activities, which normally are supported by
taxes and intergovernmental revenues, are reported separately from
business-type activities, which rely to a significant extent on fees and
charges for support. Likewise, the primary government is reported
separately from certain legally separate component units for which the
primary government is financially accountable. 
The Statement of Activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct
expenses of a given function or segment is offset by program revenues. 
Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific func-
tion or segment. Program revenues include (1) charges to customers
or applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, 
or privileges provided by a given function or segment and (2) grants
26 
Page 29
and contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital
requirements of a particular function or segment. Taxes and other items
not properly included among program revenues are reported instead as
general revenues.
Fund Financial Statements
Separate financial statements are provided for governmental funds, propri-
etary funds and fiduciary funds, even though the latter are excluded from
the government-wide financial statements. Major individual governmental
funds and major individual enterprise funds are reported as separate col-
umns in the fund financial statements. 
C. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement
Presentation
Government-wide Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the econ-
omic resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting,
as is the proprietary fund and fiduciary fund financial statements. Reve-
nues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liabil-
ity is incurred, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property
taxes are recognized as revenues in the year for which they are levied. 
Grants and similar items are recognized as revenue as soon as all elig-
ibility requirements imposed by the provider have been met. As a general
rule, the effect of interfund activity has been eliminated from the
government-wide financial statements. 
Amounts reported as program revenues include (1) charges to customers
or applicants for goods, services, or privileges provided, (2) operating
grants and contributions, and (3) capital grants and contributions, includ-
ing special assessments. Internally dedicated resources are reported as
general revenues rather than as program revenues. Likewise, general
revenues include all taxes and excises. 
Fund Financial Statements
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current
financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of
accounting.  Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measur-
able and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they
are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay
liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the government con-
siders property tax revenues to be available if they are collected within
60 days of the end of the current fiscal period. All other revenue items are
considered to be measurable and available only when cash is received
by the government. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is
incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expendi-
tures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and
claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is due. 
27 
Page 30
The government reports the following major governmental funds: 
• The general fund is the government’s primary operating fund. 
It accounts for all financial resources of the general government, 
except those required to be accounted for in another fund. 
Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-
operating items. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from
providing services and producing and delivering goods in connection with
a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The principal operating
revenues of the enterprise fund are charges to customers for sales and
services. Operating expenses for enterprise funds include the cost of
sales and services, administrative expenses and depreciation on capital
assets. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are
reported as nonoperating revenues and expenses. 
Private-sector standards of accounting and financial reporting issued
prior to December 1, 1989 generally are followed in both the government-
wide and proprietary fund financial statements to the extent that those
standards do not conflict with or contradict guidance of the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board. Governments also have the option of fol-
lowing subsequent private-sector guidance for their business-type activi-
ties and enterprise funds, subject to this same limitation. The government
has elected not to follow subsequent private-sector guidance. 
The government reports the following major proprietary funds: 
• The water fund is used to report the Town’s water enterprise fund
operations. 
• The sewer fund is used to report the Town’s sewer enterprise fund
operations. 
The self-insured employee health program is reported as an internal ser-
vice fund in the accompanying financial statements. 
The pension trust fund accounts for the activities of the Employees
Contributory Retirement System, which accumulates resources for
pension benefit payments to qualified employees. 
The agency fund is custodial in nature and is used to account for funds
held for others. Agency funds report only assets and liabilities, and thus
have no measurement focus. 
D. Cash and Short-Term Investments
Cash balances from all funds, except those required to be segregated by
law, are combined to form a consolidation of cash. Cash balances are
28 
Page 31
invested to the extent available, and interest earnings are recognized in
the General Fund. Certain special revenue, proprietary, and fiduciary
funds segregate cash, and investment earnings become a part of those
funds. 
Deposits with financial institutions consist primarily of demand deposits, 
certificates of deposits, and savings accounts. A cash and investment
pool is maintained that is available for use by all funds. Each fund’s
portion of this pool is reflected on the combined financial statements
under the caption “cash and short-term investments”.  The interest earn-
ings attributable to each fund type was included under investment income. 
For purpose of the statement of cash flows, the proprietary funds consider
investments with original maturities of three months or less to be short-
term investments. 
E. Investments
State and local statutes place certain limitations on the nature of deposits
and investments available. Deposits in any financial institution may not
exceed certain levels within the financial institution. Non-fiduciary fund
investments can be made in securities issued by or unconditionally guar-
anteed by the U.S. Government or agencies that have a maturity of one
year or less from the date of purchase and repurchase agreements guar-
anteed by such securities with maturity dates of no more than 90 days
from the date of purchase. 
Investments for the Contributory Retirement System are fully invested in
the Commonwealth’s Pension Reserve Investment Trust, and are carried
at fair value. 
F. Property Tax Limitations
Legislation known as “Proposition 2½” has limited the amount of revenue
that can be derived from property taxes. The prior fiscal year’s tax levy
limit is used as a base and cannot increase by more than 2.5 percent
(excluding new growth), unless an override is voted. The actual fiscal
year 2011 tax levy reflected an excess capacity of $ 58,357. 
G. Inventories
Inventories are valued at cost using the first-in/first-out (FIFO) method. 
The costs of governmental fund-type inventories are recorded as expendi-
tures when purchased rather than when consumed. No significant
inventory balances were on hand in governmental funds.

Page 32
H. Capital Assets
Capital assets, which include property, plant, equipment, and infra-
structure assets are reported in the applicable governmental or business-
type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements. 
Capital assets are defined by the government as assets with an initial
individual cost of more than $ 5,000 and an estimated useful life in excess
of two years. Such assets are recorded at historical cost or estimated
historical cost if purchased or constructed. Donated capital assets are
recorded at estimated fair market value at the date of donation. 
The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value
of the asset or materially extend assets lives are not capitalized. 
Major outlays for capital assets and improvements are capitalized as pro-
jects are constructed. Interest incurred during the construction phase of
capital assets of business-type activities is included as part of the capital-
ized value of the assets constructed. 
Property, plant, equipment, and infrastructure of the primary government, 
as well as the component units, is depreciated using the straight-line
method over the following estimated useful lives: 
Assets
Buildings
Building improvements
Infrastructure
Vehicles
Machinery, equipment and furnishings

I. Compensated Absences
It is the government’s policy to permit employees to accumulate earned
but unused vacation and sick pay benefits. All vested sick and vacation
pay is accrued when incurred in the government-wide, proprietary, and
fiduciary fund financial statements. A liability for these amounts is
reported in governmental funds only if they have matured, for example, 
as a result of employee resignations and retirements. 
J. Long-Term Obligations
In the government-wide financial statements, and proprietary fund types
in the fund financial statements, long-term debt, and other long-term
obligations are reported as liabilities in the applicable governmental
activities, business-type activities, or proprietary fund type Statement of
Net Assets. 
30 
Page 33
K. Fund Equity
Fund equity at the governmental fund financial reporting level is classified
as “fund balance”.  Fund equity for all other reporting is classified as “net
assets”.
Fund Balance - Generally, fund balance represents the difference
between the current assets and current liabilities. The Town reserves
those portions of fund balance that are legally segregated for a specific
future use or which do not represent available, spendable resources
and therefore, are not available for appropriation or expenditure. 
Unassigned fund balance indicates that portion of fund balance that is
available for appropriation in future periods. 
The Town’s fund balance classification policies and procedures are as
follows: 
1) Nonspendable funds are either unspendable in the current form
(i.e., inventory, petty cash, or prepaid items) or can never be spent
(i.e., perpetual care).
2) Restricted funds are used solely for the purpose in which the fund
was established. In the case of special revenue funds, these funds
are created by statute or otherwise have external constraints on
how the funds can be expended. 
3) Committed funds are reported and expended as a result of motions
passed by the highest decision making authority in the government
(i.e., the Board of Selectmen).
4) Assigned funds are used for specific purposes as established by
management. These funds, which include encumbrances, have
been assigned for specific goods and services ordered but not yet
paid for. This account also includes fund balance (free cash) voted
to be used in the subsequent fiscal year. 
5) Unassigned funds are available to be spent in future periods. 
When an expenditure is incurred that would qualify for payment from multi-
ple fund balance types, the Town uses the following order to liquidate
liabilities: restricted, committed, assigned, and unassigned. 
Net Assets - Net assets represent the difference between assets and lia-
bilities. Net assets invested in capital assets, net of related debt, consist
of capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, reduced by the out-
standing balances of any borrowing used for the acquisition, construction
or improvement of those assets. Net assets are reported as restricted
when there are limitations imposed on their use either through the ena-
bling legislation adopted by the Town or through external restrictions
31 
Page 34
imposed by creditors, grantors, or laws or regulations of other govern-
ments. All other net assets are reported as unrestricted. 
L. Use of Estimates
The preparation of basic financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures for contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the basic
financial statements, and the reported amounts of the revenues and
expenditures/expenses during the fiscal year. Actual results could vary
from estimates that were used. 
2. Stewardship, Compliance, and Accountability
A. Budgetary Information
At the annual town meeting, the Chief Financial Officer presents an
operating and capital budget for the proposed expenditures of the fiscal
year commencing the following July 1. The budget, as enacted by town
meeting, establishes the legal level of control and specifies that certain
appropriations are to be funded by particular revenues. The original
budget is amended during the fiscal year at special town meetings as
required by changing conditions. In cases of extraordinary or unforeseen
expenses, the Finance Committee is empowered to transfer funds from
the Reserve Fund (a contingency appropriation) to a departmental
appropriation. “Extraordinary” includes expenses which are not in the
usual line, or are great or exceptional. “Unforeseen” includes expenses
which are not foreseen as of the time of the annual meeting when appro-
priations are voted. 
Departments are limited to the line items as voted. Certain items may
exceed the line item budget as approved if it is for an emergency and for
the safety of the general public. These items are limited by the Massa-
chusetts General Laws and must be raised in the next year’s tax rate. 
Formal budgetary integration is employed as a management control
device during the year for the General Fund and Proprietary Funds. 
Effective budgetary control is achieved for all other funds through
provisions of the Massachusetts General Laws. 
At year-end, appropriation balances lapse, except for certain unexpended
capital items and encumbrances which will be honored during the subse-
quent year. 
32 
Page 35
B. Budgetary Basis
The General Fund final appropriation appearing on the “Budget and
Actual” page of the fund financial statements represents the final amended
budget after all reserve fund transfers and supplemental appropriations. 
C. Budget/GAAP Reconciliation
The budgetary data for the general and proprietary funds is based upon
accounting principles that differ from generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples (GAAP).  Therefore, in addition to the GAAP basis financial state-
ments, the results of operations of the general fund are presented in
accordance with budgetary accounting principles to provide a meaningful
comparison to budgetary data. 
The following is a summary of adjustments made to the actual revenues
and other sources, and expenditures and other uses, to conform to the
budgetary basis of accounting.

3. Cash and Short-Term Investments
Custodial Credit Risk - Deposits. Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the
event of a bank failure, the Town’s and Contributory Retirement System’s (the
System) deposits may not be returned. Massachusetts General Law Chapter
44, Section 55, limits the Town’s deposits “in a bank or trust company or
banking company to an amount not exceeding sixty percent of the capital and
surplus of such bank or trust company or banking company, unless satisfac-
tory security is given to it by such bank or trust company or banking company
for such excess.” The Town’s deposit policy for custodial credit risk is to limit
unsecured bank deposits to no more than 5% of the institution’s assets and
no more than 10% of the municipality’s cash. 
Massachusetts General Law Chapter 32, Section 23, limits the System’s
deposits “in a bank or trust company to an amount not exceeding ten percent
of the capital and surplus of such bank or trust company.” The System does
not have a deposit policy for custodial credit risk. 
As of June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, $ 22,639,650 and $ 981,961 of
the Town’s and System’s bank balances of $ 59,785,846 and $ 1,597,454
respectively, was exposed to custodial credit risk as uninsured or uncollateral-
ized. 
Of the Town’s balance exposed to custodial credit risk, $ 14,652,196 is on
deposit with Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust. 
Of the System’s balance exposed to custodial credit risk, $ 925,309 is on
deposit with the Pension Reserve Investment Trust and $ 56,652 is on
deposit with Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust.

4. Investments
A. Credit Risk
Generally, credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not
fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment. For short-term invest-
ments that were purchased using surplus revenues, Massachusetts
General Law, Chapter 44, Section 55, limits the Town’s investments to the
top rating issued by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating
organization (NRSROs).
Presented below (in thousands) is the actual rating as of year-end for
each investment of the Town. (All federal agency securities have an
implied credit rating of AAA):

5,118 5,118 -  -  -
$ 13,756 $ 5,615 $ 527 $ 218 $ 7,396
Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 32, Section 23, limits the investment
of System funds, to the extent not required for current disbursements, in the
PRIT Fund or in securities, other than mortgages or collateral loans, which
are legal for the investment of funds in savings banks under the laws of the
Commonwealth, provided that no more than the established percentage of
assets, is invested in any one security. 
At December 31, 2010, the Contributory Retirement System maintained its
investments in the State Investment Pool* with a fair value of $ 194,334,325. 
This investment type is not rated. 
*Fair value is the same as the value of the pool share. The Pension Reserves Investment
Trust was created under Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 32, Section 22, in December
1983. The Pension Reserves Investment Trust is operated under contract with a private
investment advisor, approved by the Pension Reserves Investment Management Board. The
Pension Reserves Investment Management Board shall choose an investment advisor by
requesting proposals from advisors and reviewing such proposals based on criteria adopted
under Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 30B. 
36 
Page 39
B. Custodial Credit Risk
The custodial credit risk for investments is the risk that, in the event of the
failure of the counterparty (e.g. broker-dealer) to a transaction, a govern-
ment will not be able to recover the value of its investment or collateral
securities that are in the possession of another party. The Town’s policy
for custodial credit risk is to limit investments to the state investment pool, 
U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. Agency obligations, and certificates of
deposit. The System does not have policies for custodial credit risk. 
The Town’s investments were exposed to custodial credit risk because the
related securities are uninsured, unregistered, and/or held by the Town’s
brokerage firm, which is also the Counterparty to these securities. The
Town manages this custodial credit risk with SIPC and excess SIPC. 
The System’s investments were exposed to custodial credit risk as unin-
sured and uncollateralized. However, these investments were held in the
State Investment Pool. 
C. Concentration of Credit Risk
The Town’s policy for concentration of credit risk is to limit investments in
a single financial institution to no more than 10% of the Town’s invest-
ments with the exception of U.S. Treasury obligations or investments fully
collateralized by U.S. Treasuries or agencies, and state pools. 
Town investments in any one issuer (other than U.S. Treasury securities
and mutual funds) that represent 5% or more of total investments are as
follows: 
Federal Home Loan Bank
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
Federal National Mortgage Association 
$  1,026,148
1,224,742
2,866,743
Massachusetts General Law Chapter 32, Section 23 limits the amount the
System may invest in any one issuer or security type, with the exception of
the PRIT Fund. 
The Contributory Retirement System does not have an investment in one
issuer greater than 5% of total investments. 
D. Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will
adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Generally, the longer
the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value
to changes in market interest rates. The Town’s policy for interest rate
37 
Page 40
risk is to structure the portfolio so securities mature to meet all operating
requirements that may be reasonably anticipated, thus avoiding the need
to sell securities on the open market prior to maturity. The System does
not have a formal investment policy that limits investment maturities as a
means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increas-
ing interest rates. 
Information about the sensitivity of the fair values of the Town’s invest-
ments to market interest rate fluctuations is as follows (in thousands):

$  10,291 $  1,771$ 6,660$ 1,659$ 201
The Retirement system does not maintain investments that are sensitive
to market interest rate fluctuations. 
E. Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates
will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. The Town and
System do not have policies for foreign currency risk. 
5. Taxes Receivable
Real estate and personal property taxes are levied and based on values
assessed on January 1st of every year. Assessed values are established by
the Board of Assessor’s for 100% of the estimated fair market value. Taxes
are due on a quarterly basis and are subject to penalties and interest if they
are not paid by the respective due date. Real estate and personal property
taxes levied are recorded as receivables in the fiscal year they relate to. 
Fourteen days after the due date for the final tax bill for real estate taxes, a
demand notice may be sent to the delinquent taxpayer. Fourteen days after
the demand notice has been sent, the tax collector may proceed to file a lien
against the delinquent taxpayers’ property. The Town has an ultimate right to
foreclose on property for unpaid taxes. Personal property taxes cannot be
secured through the lien process.

A. General Obligation Bonds
The Town issues general obligation bonds to provide funds for the
acquisition and construction of major capital facilities. General obligation

E. Legal Debt Margin
The Town is subject to the General Laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts which, in general, limits the amount of bonded debt
the Town may have outstanding to 5 percent of the valuation of taxable
property as last equalized by the Commonwealth’s Department of
Revenue. The following is a computation of the legal debt margin as
of June 30, 2011 (in thousands):

F. Advance and Current Refundings
Prior Years
In prior years, the Town has defeased various bond issues by creating
separate irrevocable trust funds. The proceeds from the new issuances
of the general obligation bonds were used to purchase U.S. government
securities, and those securities were deposited in an irrevocable trust with
an escrow agent to provide debt service payments until the refunded
bonds mature on March 15, 2015, February 1, 2019, and March 1, 2020. 
For financial reporting purposes, the debt has been considered defeased
and therefore removed as a liability from the Town’s balance sheet. 
As of June 30, 2011, the total amount of defeased debt outstanding but
removed from the governmental activities and business-type activities was
$ 24,295,000.

14. Restricted Net Assets
The accompanying entity-wide financial statements report restricted net
assets when external constraints from grantors or contributors are placed
on net assets. 
Permanent fund restricted net assets are segregated between nonexpend-
able and expendable. The nonexpendable portion represents the original
restricted principal contribution, and the expendable represents accumulated
earnings which are available to be spent based on donor restrictions. 
15. Governmental Funds - Balances
Fund balances are segregated to account for resources that are either not
available for expenditure in the future or are legally set aside for a specific
future use. 
In fiscal year 2011, the Town implemented GASB Statement No. 54
(GASB 54), Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Defi-
nitions, which enhances the usefulness of fund balance information by pro-
viding clearer fund balance classifications that can be more consistently
applied and by clarifying existing governmental fund type definitions. 
The following types of fund balances are reported at June 30, 2011: 
48 
Page 51
Nonspendable - Represents amounts that cannot be spent because they
are either (a) not in spendable form or (b) legally or contractually required to
be maintained intact. This fund balance classification includes general fund
reserves for prepaid expenditures, petty cash, and nonmajor governmental
fund reserves for the principal portion of permanent trust funds. 
Restricted - Represents amounts that are restricted to specific purposes by
constraints imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations
of other governments, or constraints imposed by law through constitutional
provisions or enabling legislation. This fund balance classification includes
general fund encumbrances funded by bond issuances, various special
revenue funds, and the income portion of permanent trust funds. 
Committed - Represents amounts that can only be used for specific pur-
poses pursuant to constraints imposed by formal action of the Town’s highest
level of decision-making authority. This fund balance classification includes
general fund encumbrances for non-lapsing, special article appropriations
approved at Town Meeting, stabilization funds set aside by Town Meeting
vote for future capital acquisitions and improvements (now reported as part of
the general fund per GASB 54), and various special revenue funds. 
Assigned - Represents amounts that are constrained by the Town’s intent to
use these resources for a specific purpose. This fund balance classification
includes general fund encumbrances that have been established by various
Town departments for the expenditure of current year budgetary financial
resources upon vendor performance in the subsequent budgetary period. 
Unassigned - Represents amounts that are available to be spent in future
periods.

16. General Fund Unassigned Fund Balance
The unassigned general fund balance reported on the balance sheet is stated
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which
differs in certain respects from the Massachusetts Uniform Municipal
Accounting System (UMAS).  The following paragraphs summarize the major
differences. 
Massachusetts General Laws include provisions to allow municipalities to
overexpend certain appropriations if they are incurred in an emergency
situation and for the safety of the public. The most common example involves
the “snow and ice” appropriation. All such overexpenditures, however, must
be funded in the subsequent year’s tax rate. 
The accompanying financial statements include an estimate for future
potential tax refunds, which is not recognized under UMAS. 
The following summarizes the specific differences between GAAP basis and
budgetary basis of reporting the general fund unassigned fund balance:

Page 53
17. Commitments and Contingencies
Outstanding Legal Issues - There are several pending legal issues in which
the Town is involved. The Town’s management is of the opinion that the
poten-tial future settlement of such claims would not materially affect its
financial statements taken as a whole. 
Grants - Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to
audit and adjustment by grantor agencies, principally the federal government. 
Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute
a liability of the applicable funds. The amount of expenditures which may
be disallowed by the grantor cannot be determined at this time, although the
Town expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 
18. Post-Employment Healthcare and Life Insurance Benefits
Other Post-Employment Benefits
GASB Statement 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for
Post-Employment Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires governments to
account for other post-employment benefits (OPEB), primarily healthcare, 
on an accrual basis rather than on a pay-as-you-go basis. The effect is the
recognition of an actuarially required contribution as an expense on the
Statement of Activities when a future retiree earns their post-employment
benefits, rather than when they use their post-employment benefit. To the
extent that an entity does not fund their actuarially required contribution, a
post-employment benefit liability is recognized on the Statement of Net
Assets over time. 
A. Plan Description
In addition to providing the pension benefits described, the Town pro- 
vides post-employment healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired
employees through the Town’s plan. The benefits, benefit levels, 
employee contributions and employer contributions are governed by
Chapter 32 of the Massachusetts General Laws. As of July 1, 2010, the
actuarial valuation date, approximately 1,592 retirees and 1,951 active
employees meet the eligibility requirements. The plan does not issue a
separate financial report. 
B. Benefits Provided
The Town provides medical, prescription drug, mental health/substance
abuse and life insurance to retirees and their covered dependents. All
active employees who retire from the Town and meet the eligibility criteria
will receive these benefits. 
51 
Page 54
C. Funding Policy
Retirees contribute various percentages of the cost of the health plan, as
determined by the Town. The Town contributes the remainder of the
health plan costs on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
D. Annual OPEB Costs and Net OPEB Obligation
The Town’s fiscal 2011 annual OPEB expense is calculated based on the
annual required contribution of the employer (ARC), an amount actuarially
determined in accordance with the parameters of GASB Statement No. 
45. The ARC represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing
basis, is projected to cover the normal cost per year and amortize the
unfunded actuarial liability over a period of thirty years. The following
table shows the components of the Town’s annual OPEB cost for the year
ending June 30, 2011, the amount actually contributed to the plan, and the
change in the Town’s net OPEB obligation based on an actuarial valuation
as of July 1, 2010.

E. Funded Status and Funding Progress
The funded status of the plan as of July 1, 2010, the date of the most
recent actuarial valuation was as follows: 
52 
Page 55
Actuarial accrued liability (AAL)
Actuarial value of plan assets

$  371,529,899
-
$  371,529,899
0%
$  113,924,177
326%
Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of
reported amount and assumptions about the probability of occurrence of
events far into the future. Examples included assumptions about future
employment, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend. Amounts deter-
mined regarding the funded status of the plan and the annual required
contributions of the employer are subject to continual revision as actual
results are compared with past expectations and new estimates are made
about the future. The schedule of funding progress, presented as required
supplementary information following the notes to the financial statements, 
presents multiyear trend information that shows whether the actuarial
value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to the
actuarial accrued liabilities for benefits. 
F. Actuarial Methods and Assumptions
Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the
plan as understood by the Town and the plan members and include the
types of benefits provided at the time of each valuation and the historical
pattern of sharing of benefit costs between the Town and plan members
to that point. The actuarial methods and assumptions used include
techniques that are designed to reduce short-term volatility in actuarial
accrued liabilities and the actuarial value of assets, consistent with the
long-term perspective of the calculations. 
In the July 1, 2010 actuarial valuation the projected unit credit cost method
was used. The actuarial value of assets was not determined as the Town
has not advance funded its obligation. The actuarial assumptions included
a 4% investment rate of return and an initial annual healthcare cost trend
rate of 7% which decreases to a 5% long-term rate for all healthcare
benefits after five years. The amortization costs for the initial UAAL is a
level percentage of payroll for a period of 30 years, on an open basis. 
This has been calculated assuming the amortization payment increases at
a rate of 4.5%.

The Town follows the provisions of GASB Statement No. 27, Accounting for
Pensions for State and Local Government Employees, (as amended by
GASB 50) with respect to the employees’ retirement funds. 
A. Plan Description and Contribution Information
Substantially all employees of the Town (except teachers and administra-
tors under contract employed by the School Department) are members of
the Framingham Contributory Retirement System (FCRS), a cost sharing, 
multiple employer defined benefit PERS. Eligible employees must partici-
pate in the FCRS. The pension plan provides pension benefits, deferred
allowances, and death and disability benefits. Chapter 32 of the
Massachusetts General Laws establishes the authority of the FCRS
Retirement Board. Chapter 32 also establishes contribution percentages
and benefits paid. The FCRS Retirement Board does not have the
authority to amend benefit provisions. As required by Massachusetts
General Laws, the System issues a separate report to the Common-
wealth’s Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission. 
Membership of each plan consisted of the following at December 31, 
2010: 
Retirees and beneficiaries receiving benefits 789
Terminated plan members entitled to but not yet
receiving benefits  251
Active plan members  1,070
Total  2,110 
Number of participating employers  3
Employee contribution percentages are specified in Chapter 32 of the
Massachusetts General Laws. The percentage is determined by the
participant’s date of entry into the system. All employees hired after
January 1, 1979 contribute an additional 2% on all gross regular earnings
over the rate of $ 30,000 per year. The percentages are as follows: 
Before January 1, 1975
January 1, 1975 - December 31, 1983
January 1, 1984 - June 30, 1996
Beginning July 1, 1996

B. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Accounting - Contributory retirement system financial statements
are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Plan member contri-
butions are recognized in the period in which the contributions are due. 
Employer contributions are recognized when due and the employer has
made a formal commitment to provide the contributions. Benefits and
refunds are recognized when due and payable in accordance with the
terms of the plan. 
Method Used to Value Investments - Investments are reported at fair
value in accordance with PERAC requirements.

D. Actuarial Methods and Assumptions
The annual required contribution for the current year was determined as
part of the actuarial valuation using the entry age normal actuarial cost
method. Under this method an unfunded actuarial accrued liability of
$ 91.6 million was calculated. The actuarial assumptions included (a) 8 %
investment rate of return and (b) a projected salary increase of 4.75 -
5.25 % per year. Liabilities for cost of living increases have been
assumed at an annual increase of 3 %, on the first $ 12,000 of benefit
payments. The actuarial value of assets is determined by projecting the
market value of assets as of the beginning of the prior plan year with the
assumed rate of return during that year (8 %) and accounting for deposits
and disbursements with interest at the assumed rate of return. An
adjustment is then applied to recognize the difference between the actual
investment return and expected return over a five-year period. As of
December 31, 2010, the unfunded actuarially accrued liability is being
amortized over 19 years using a 4.00 % annual increasing basis. 
E. Teachers
As required by State statutes, teachers of the Town are covered by the
Massachusetts Teachers Retirement System (MTRS).  The MTRS is
funded by contributions from covered employees and the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts. The Town is not required to contribute. All persons
employed on at least a half-time basis, who are covered under a contrac-
tual agreement requiring certification by the Board of Education are eligi-
ble, and must participate in the MTRS. 
Based on the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ retirement laws, employ-
ees covered by the pension plan must contribute a percentage of gross
earnings into the pension fund. The percentage is determined by the
participant’s date of entry into the system and gross earnings, up to
$ 30,000, as follows: 
Before January 1, 1975
January 1, 1975 - December 31, 1983
January 1, 1984 - June 30, 1996
July 1, 1996 - June 30, 2001
Beginning July 1, 2001 
5%
7% *
8% *
9% *
11%
*Effective January 1, 1990, all participants hired after January 1, 1979, who
have not elected to increase to 11%, contribute an additional 2% of salary in
excess of $ 30,000. 
The Town’s current year covered payroll for teachers and administrators was
unavailable.

Page 59
In fiscal year 2011, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts contributed
$ 19,785,698 to the MTRS on behalf of the Town. This is included in the
education expenditures and intergovernmental revenues in the general fund. 
20. Self-insurance
The Town self-insures against claims for workers compensation, unemploy-
ment and most employee health coverage. Annual estimated requirements
for claims are provided in the Town’s annual operating budget. 
Health Insurance
The Town contracts with an insurance carrier for excess liability coverage
and an insurance consultant for claims processing. Under the terms of its
insurance coverage, the Town is liable for claims up to $ 75,000 per incident, 
with a maximum lifetime coverage of $ 2,000,000. The claims liability repre-
sents an estimate of claims incurred but unpaid at year-end, based on past
historical costs and claims paid subsequent to year-end. 
Changes in the aggregate liability for claims for the year ended June 30, 2011
are as follows: 
Health
Coverage
Claims liability, beginning of year, as restated $  5,301,398
Claims incurred/recognized
in fiscal year 2011  45,861,448
Claims paid in fiscal year 2011  (44,457,489)
Claims liability, end of year  $  6,705,357
21. Risk Management
The Town is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage
to and destruction of assets; errors and omissions; and natural disasters for
which the government carries commercial insurance. There were no signifi-
cant reductions in insurance coverage from the previous year and have been
no material settlements in excess of coverage in any of the past three fiscal
years.
