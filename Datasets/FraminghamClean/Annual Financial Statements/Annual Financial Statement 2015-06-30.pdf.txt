To the Board of Selectmen
Town of Framingham, Massachusetts
Report on the Financial Statements 
Additional Offices:
Nashua, NH
Manchester, NH
Greenfield, MA
Ellsworth, ME
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of the governmental activi-
ties, the business-type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund
information of the Town of Framingham, Massachusetts, as of and for the year ended
June 30, 2015 (except for the Framingham Contributory Retirement System which is
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014), and the related notes to the finan-
cial statements, which collectively comprise the Town’s basic financial statements as
listed in the Table of Contents. 
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
The Town’s management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation
of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, 
and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation
of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error. 
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements based on
our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial
audits contained in Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller
General of the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free from material misstatement. 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the
auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of
the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assess-
ments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and
Page 5
fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by manage-
ment, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our audit opinions. 
Opinions
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the respective financial position of the governmental activities, the business- 
type activities, each major fund, and the aggregate remaining fund information of the
Town of Framingham, as of June 30, 2015 (except for the Framingham Contributory
Retirement System which is as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014), and
the respective changes in financial position and, where applicable, cash flows thereof
and the respective budgetary comparison for the general fund for the year then ended
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. 
Other Matters
Required Supplementary Information
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require
that Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the Schedule of Funding Progress, the
Schedule of Proportionate Share of Net Pension Liability, the Schedule of Contribu-
tions, the Schedule of Changes in Net Pension Liability, and the Schedules of Net
Pension Liability, Contributions, and Investment Returns be presented to supple-
ment the basic financial statements. Such information, although not a part of the
basic financial statements, is required by the Governmental Accounting Standards
Board, who considers it to be an essential part of financial reporting for placing the
basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical
context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary
information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United
States of America, which consisted of inquiries of management about the methods
of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with
management’s responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other
knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not
express an opinion or provide any assurance on the information because the limited
procedures do not provide us with evidence sufficient to express an opinion or pro-
vide any assurance.

Other Reporting Required by Government Auditing Standards
In accordance with Government Auditing Standards, we have also issued our report
dated March 7, 2016 on our consideration of the Town's internal control over
financial reporting and on our tests of its compliance with certain provisions of laws, 
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements and other matters. The purpose of that
report is to describe the scope of our testing of internal control over financial report-
ing and compliance and the results of that testing, and not to provide an opinion on
internal control over financial reporting or on compliance. That report is an integral
part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in
considering the Town’s internal control over financial reporting and compliance.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
As management of the Town of Framingham, we offer readers this narrative over-
view and analysis of the financial activities of the Town of Framingham for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 2015. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts reported in this
analysis are expressed in thousands. 
A. OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
This discussion and analysis is intended to serve as an introduction to the basic
financial statements. The basic financial statements are comprised of three com-
ponents: (1) government-wide financial statements, (2) fund financial statements, 
and (3) notes to financial statements. This report also contains other supple-
mentary information in addition to the basic financial statements themselves. 
Government-wide financial statements. The government-wide financial state-
ments are designed to provide readers with a broad overview of our finances in
a manner similar to a private-sector business. 
The Statement of Net Position presents information on all assets and liabilities, 
with the difference between the two reported as net position. Over time, increases
or decreases in net position may serve as a useful indicator of whether the finan-
cial position is improving or deteriorating. 
The Statement of Activities presents information showing how the government’s
net position changed during the most recent fiscal year. All changes in net posi-
tion are reported as soon as the underlying event giving rise to the change
occurs, regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Thus, revenues and
expenses are reported in this statement for some items that will only result in
cash flows in future fiscal periods (e.g., uncollected taxes and earned but unused
vacation leave).
Both of the government-wide financial statements distinguish functions that are
principally supported by taxes and intergovernmental revenues (governmental
activities) from other functions that are intended to recover all or a significant
portion of their costs through user fees and charges (business-type activities).
The governmental activities include general government, public safety, educa-
tion, public works, health and human services, and culture and recreation. The
business-type activities include water and sewer activities. 
Fund financial statements. A fund is a grouping of related accounts that is used
to maintain control over resources that have been segregated for specific activi-
ties or objectives. Fund accounting is used to ensure and demonstrate compli-
ance with finance-related legal requirements. All of the funds can be divided into
three categories: governmental funds, proprietary funds and fiduciary funds. 
Governmental funds. Governmental funds are used to account for essentially
the same functions reported as governmental activities in the government-wide
4
Page 8
financial statements. However, unlike the government-wide financial statements, 
governmental fund financial statements focus on near-term inflows and outflows
of spendable resources, as well as on balances of spendable resources available
at the end of the fiscal year. Such information may be useful in evaluating a gov-
ernment’s near-term financing requirements. 
Because the focus of governmental funds is narrower than that of the government-
wide financial statements, it is useful to compare the information presented for
governmental funds with similar information presented for governmental activities
in the government-wide financial statements. By doing so, readers may better
understand the long-term impact of the government’s near-term financing deci-
sions. Both the governmental fund balance sheet and the governmental fund
statement of revenues, expenditures and changes in fund balances provide a
reconciliation to facilitate this comparison between governmental funds and gov-
ernmental activities. 
An annual appropriated budget is adopted for the general fund. A budgetary
comparison statement has been provided for the general fund to demonstrate
compliance with this budget. 
Proprietary funds. Proprietary funds are maintained as follows: 
Enterprise funds are used to report the same functions presented as business-
type activities in the government-wide financial statements. Specifically, enter-
prise funds are used to account for water and sewer operations. 
Internal service funds are an accounting device used to accumulate and allocate
costs internally among various functions. Specifically, internal service funds are
used to account for self-insured employee health programs. Because these ser-
vices predominantly benefit governmental rather than business-type functions, 
they have been included within governmental activities in the government-wide
financial statements. The Town converted from a self-insurance program to a
premium-based program through GIC insurance for fiscal year 2015. 
Proprietary funds provide the same type of information as the business-type activ-
ities reported in the government-wide financial statements, only in more detail. 
The proprietary fund financial statements provide separate information for the
water and sewer operations, both of which are considered to be major funds. 
Fiduciary funds. Fiduciary funds are used to account for resources held for the
benefit of parties outside the government. Fiduciary funds are not reflected in the
government-wide financial statements because the resources of those funds are
not available to support the Town’s own programs. The accounting used for fidu-
ciary funds is much like that used for proprietary funds. 
Notes to financial statements. The notes provide additional information that is
essential to a full understanding of the data provided in the government-wide and
fund financial statements.

Other information. In addition to the basic financial statements and accom-
panying notes, this report also presents certain required supplementary infor-
mation which is required to be disclosed by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

As noted earlier, net position may serve over time as a useful indicator of a govern-
ment’s financial position. At the close of the most recent fiscal year, total net posi-
tion was $84,667,667, a change of $614,519 from the prior year. 
The largest portion of net position, $194,095,667 reflects our investment in capital
assets (e.g., land, construction in progress, buildings and improvements, vehicles, 
machinery, equipment, and infrastructure); less any related debt used to acquire
those assets that are still outstanding. These capital assets are used to provide
7
Page 11
services to citizens; consequently, these assets are not available for future spend-
ing. Although the investment in capital assets is reported net of related debt, it
should be noted that the resources needed to repay this debt must be provided
from other sources, since the capital assets themselves cannot be used to liqui-
date these liabilities. 
An additional portion of net position, $12,966,137 represents resources that are
subject to external restrictions on how they may be used. The remaining balance
of unrestricted net position deficit of $(122,394,137) primarily results from the
Town’s unfunded net pension and OPEB liabilities. 
Governmental activities. Governmental activities for the year resulted in a
change in net position of $829,402. Key elements of this change are as follows
(in thousands):
Excess of revenues over (under) expenditures:
General fund
Internal service fund
General fund transfers from enterprise funds, net

The reduction in the net position primarily results from current year depreciation
(not funded in the rates) exceeding long-term debt principal payments (funded in
the rates).
D. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNMENT’S FUNDS
As noted earlier, fund accounting is used to ensure and demonstrate compliance
with finance-related legal requirements.

Page 12
Governmental funds. The focus of governmental funds is to provide information
on near-term inflows, outflows and balances of spendable resources. Such infor-
mation is useful in assessing financing requirements. In particular, unassigned
fund balance may serve as a useful measure of a government’s net resources
available for spending at the end of the fiscal year. 
As of the end of the current fiscal year, governmental funds reported combined
ending fund balances of $35,785,791, a change of $(2,395,960) in comparison to
the prior year. 
The general fund is the chief operating fund. At the end of the current fiscal year, 
unassigned fund balance of the general fund was $20,971,228 (including
$13,585,084 of general stabilization funds), while total fund balance was
$36,456,820. As a measure of the general fund’s liquidity, it may be useful to
compare both unassigned fund balance and total fund balance to total general
fund expenditures. Refer to the table below (in thousands).

Proprietary funds. Proprietary funds provide the same type of information found
in the business-type activities reported in the government-wide financial state-
ments, but in more detail. 
Unrestricted net position of the enterprise funds at the end of the year amounted
to $15,076,160, a decrease of $(86,142) from the prior year, mainly as a result of
current year depreciation expense in excess of paydowns on bonds. Other factors
concerning the finances of proprietary funds have already been addressed in the
entity-wide discussion of business-type activities. 
E. GENERAL FUND BUDGETARY HIGHLIGHTS
Differences between the original budget and the final amended budget resulted
in an overall change in appropriations of $715,009, due to a change in general
government of $5,764 and education of $709,245. The additional appropriations
were funded by free cash and transfers from other funds. 
Revenues in excess of budget mainly consist of building permits, Medicaid
reimbursements, and mitigation general fund revenues. 
F. CAPITAL ASSET AND DEBT ADMINISTRATION
Capital assets. Total investment in capital assets for governmental and business-
type activities at year-end, amounted to $406,926,209 (net of accumulated depre-
ciation), a change of $15,196,375 from the prior year. This investment in capital
assets includes land, construction in progress, buildings and improvements, 
vehicles, machinery, equipment, and infrastructure.

  Design for Wastewater Pumping Stations projects, appropriated for $8,009, 
started in the fall of 2007 and $7,110 has been expended. 
  At the 2008 Annual Town Meeting, the Town authorized over $21,000 in
water capital projects and $9,000 in sewer capital projects. $2,134 has been
expended on Grove Street water pump station appropriated for $2,932. In
addition, $2,210 and $2,296 has been expended on the Prospect Street area
water and sewer main replacement projects, originally appropriated for $3,000

RECONCILIATION OF THE STATEMENT OF REVENUES
EXPENDITURES, AND CHANGES IN FUND BALANCES OF
GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS TO THE STATEMENT OF ACTIVITIES
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2015
Net changes in fund balances - Total governmental funds
Governmental funds report capital outlays as expenditures. However,
in the Statement of Activities the cost of those assets is allocated
over their estimated useful lives and reported as depreciation expense:
Capital outlay purchases, net of disposals
Depreciation
Revenues in the Statement of Activities that do not provide current
financial resources are fully deferred in the Statement of Revenues,
Expenditures and Changes in Fund Balances. Therefore, the
recognition of revenue for various types of accounts receivable
(i.e., real estate and personal property, motor vehicle excise, etc.)
differ between the two statements. This amount represents the
net change in deferred revenue.
Some revenues reported in the Statement of Activities, such as
MSBA reimbursements for contracted assistance, do not provide
current financial resources and therefore, are not reported as
revenues in the governmental funds.
The issuance of long-term debt (e.g., bonds and leases) provides
current financial resources to governmental funds, while the
repayment of the principal of long-term debt consumes the financial
resources of governmental funds. Neither transaction, however, 
has any effect on net position:
Proceeds from debt
Repayments of debt
Change in deferred debt amortization
In the Statement of Activities, interest is accrued on outstanding
long-term debt, whereas in governmental funds interest is not
reported until due.
Some expenses reported in the Statement of Activities, do not require
the use of current financial resources and therefore, are not reported
as expenditures in the governmental funds:
Increase in liability for compensated absences
Increase in net OPEB obligation
Decrease in net pension liability, net of deferred outflows
Increase in bond premium amortization
Internal service funds are used by management to account for health
insurance and workers' compensation activities. The net activity of
internal service funds is reported with Governmental Activities.
Change in net position of governmental activities

TOWN OF FRAMINGHAM, MASSACHUSETTS
Notes to Financial Statements
1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies of the Town of Framingham (the Town) conform to
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) as applicable to govern-
mental units. The following is a summary of the more significant policies: 
A. Reporting Entity
The government is a municipal corporation governed by an elected Board
of Selectmen. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, 
these financial statements present the government and applicable compo-
nent units for which the government is considered to be financially account-
able. In fiscal year 2014, it was determined that no entities met the required
GASB 14 (as amended) criteria of component units. 
In the Fiduciary Funds: The Framingham Contributory Retirement
System which was established to provide retirement benefits primarily
to employees and their beneficiaries. The System is presented using
the accrual basis of accounting and is reported as a pension trust fund
in the fiduciary fund financial statements. Additional financial informa-
tion of the System can be obtained by contacting the System located at
150 Concord Street, Framingham, MA 01702. 
B. Government-wide and Fund Financial Statements
Government-wide Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statements (i.e., the Statement of Net
Position and the Statement of Activities) report information on all of the
nonfiduciary activities of the primary government. For the most part, the
effect of interfund activity has been removed from these statements. 
Governmental activities, which normally are supported by taxes and
intergovernmental revenues, are reported separately from business-type
activities, which rely to a significant extent on fees and charges for
support. Likewise, the primary government is reported separately from
certain legally separate component units for which the primary govern-
ment is financially accountable. 
The Statement of Activities demonstrates the degree to which the direct
expenses of a given function or segment is offset by program revenues. 
Direct expenses are those that are clearly identifiable with a specific func-
tion or segment. Program revenues include (1) charges to customers or
applicants who purchase, use, or directly benefit from goods, services, or
privileges provided by a given function or segment and (2) grants and
27 
Page 31
contributions that are restricted to meeting the operational or capital
requirements of a particular function or segment. Taxes and other items
not properly included among program revenues are reported instead as
general revenues.
Fund Financial Statements
Separate financial statements are provided for governmental funds, propri-
etary funds and fiduciary funds, even though the latter are excluded from
the government-wide financial statements. Major individual governmental
funds and major individual enterprise funds are reported as separate col-
umns in the fund financial statements. 
C. Measurement Focus, Basis of Accounting, and Financial Statement
Presentation
Government-wide Financial Statements
The government-wide financial statements are reported using the economic
resources measurement focus and the accrual basis of accounting, as is
the proprietary fund and fiduciary fund financial statements. Revenues are
recorded when earned and expenses are recorded when a liability is incurred, 
regardless of the timing of related cash flows. Property taxes are recognized
as revenues in the year for which they are levied. Grants and similar items
are recognized as revenue as soon as all eligibility requirements imposed by
the provider have been met. As a general rule, the effect of interfund activity
has been eliminated from the government- wide financial statements. 
Amounts reported as program revenues include (1) charges to customers
or applicants for goods, services, or privileges provided, (2) operating
grants and contributions, and (3) capital grants and contributions, includ-
ing special assessments. Internally dedicated resources are reported as
general revenues rather than as program revenues. Likewise, general
revenues include all taxes and excises. 
Fund Financial Statements
Governmental fund financial statements are reported using the current
financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of
accounting. Revenues are recognized as soon as they are both measur-
able and available. Revenues are considered to be available when they
are collectible within the current period or soon enough thereafter to pay
liabilities of the current period. For this purpose, the government considers
property tax revenues to be available if they are collected within 60 days
of the end of the current fiscal period. All other revenue items are consid-
ered to be measurable and available only when cash is received by the
government. Expenditures generally are recorded when a liability is
incurred, as under accrual accounting. However, debt service expendi-
tures, as well as expenditures related to compensated absences and
claims and judgments, are recorded only when payment is due.

Page 32
The government reports the following major governmental funds: 
 The general fund is the government’s primary operating fund. 
It accounts for all financial resources of the general government, 
except those required to be accounted for in another fund. 
Proprietary funds distinguish operating revenues and expenses from non-
operating items. Operating revenues and expenses generally result from
providing services and producing and delivering goods in connection with
a proprietary fund’s principal ongoing operations. The principal operating
revenues of the enterprise fund are charges to customers for sales and
services. Operating expenses for enterprise funds include the cost of
sales and services, administrative expenses and depreciation on capital
assets. All revenues and expenses not meeting this definition are reported
as nonoperating revenues and expenses. 
The government reports the following major proprietary funds: 
 The water fund is used to report the Town’s water enterprise fund
operations. 
 The sewer fund is used to report the Town’s sewer enterprise fund
operations. 
The self-insured employee health program, reported as an internal service
fund in the accompanying financial statements, was converted from a self-
insurance program to the GIC insurance plan starting in fiscal year 2015. 
The remaining balance in the fund is to pay unanticipated run-off claims. 
The Other Post-employment Trust fund is used to accumulate resources
for health and life insurance benefits for retired employees. 
The pension trust fund accounts for the activities of the Employees
Contributory Retirement System, which accumulates resources for
pension benefit payments to qualified employees. 
The agency fund is custodial in nature and is used to account for funds
held for others. Agency funds report only assets and liabilities, and thus
have no measurement focus. 
D. Cash and Short-Term Investments
Cash balances from all funds, except those required to be segregated by
law, are combined to form a consolidation of cash. Cash balances are
invested to the extent available, and interest earnings are recognized in the
General Fund. Certain special revenue, proprietary, and fiduciary funds
segregate cash, and investment earnings become a part of those funds. 
29 
Page 33
Deposits with financial institutions consist primarily of demand deposits, 
certificates of deposits, and savings accounts. A cash and investment pool
is maintained that is available for use by all funds. Each fund’s portion of
this pool is reflected on the combined financial statements under the caption
“cash and short-term investments”. The interest earnings attributable to
each fund type were included under investment income. 
For purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows, the proprietary funds con-
sider investments with original maturities of three months or less to be
short-term investments. 
E. Investments
State and local statutes place certain limitations on the nature of deposits
and investments available. Deposits in any financial institution may not
exceed certain levels within the financial institution. Non-fiduciary fund
investments can be made in securities issued by or unconditionally guar-
anteed by the U.S. Government or agencies that have a maturity of one
year or less from the date of purchase and repurchase agreements guar-
anteed by such securities with maturity dates of no more than 90 days
from the date of purchase. 
Investments for the Contributory Retirement System are fully invested in
the Commonwealth’s Pension Reserve Investment Trust, and are carried
at fair value. 
F. Property Tax Limitations
Legislation known as “Proposition 2½” has limited the amount of revenue
that can be derived from property taxes. The prior fiscal year’s tax levy
limit is used as a base and cannot increase by more than 2.5 percent
(excluding new growth), unless an override is voted. The actual fiscal
year 2015 tax levy reflected an excess capacity of $5,501.554. 
G. Inventories
Inventories are valued at cost using the first-in/first-out (FIFO) method. 
The costs of governmental fund-type inventories are recorded as expendi-
tures when purchased rather than when consumed. No significant inven-
tory balances were on hand in governmental funds. 
H. Capital Assets
Capital assets, which include property, plant, equipment, and infra-
structure assets are reported in the applicable governmental or business-
type activities columns in the government-wide financial statements. Capi-
tal assets are defined by the government as assets with an initial individ-
ual cost of more than $5,000 and an estimated useful life in excess of two
years. Such assets are recorded at historical cost or estimated historical
30 
Page 34
cost if purchased or constructed. Donated capital assets are recorded at
estimated fair market value at the date of donation. 
The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to the value
of the asset or materially extend assets lives are not capitalized. 
Major outlays for capital assets and improvements are capitalized as pro-
jects are constructed. Interest incurred during the construction phase of
capital assets of business-type activities is included as part of the capital-
ized value of the assets constructed. 
Property, plant, equipment, and infrastructure of the primary government, 
as well as the component units, are depreciated using the straight-line
method over the following estimated useful lives: 
Assets

Building improvements
Infrastructure
Vehicles
Machinery, equipment and furnishings

I. Compensated Absences
It is the government’s policy to permit employees to accumulate earned
but unused vacation and sick pay benefits. All vested sick and vacation
pay is accrued when incurred in the government-wide, proprietary, and
fiduciary fund financial statements. A liability for these amounts is reported
in governmental funds only if they have matured, for example, as a result
of employee resignations and retirements. 
J. Long-Term Obligations
In the government-wide financial statements, and proprietary fund types
in the fund financial statements, long-term debt, and other long-term
obligations are reported as liabilities in the applicable governmental
activities, business-type activities, or proprietary fund type Statement of
Net Position. 
K. Fund Equity
Fund equity at the governmental fund financial reporting level is classified
as “fund balance”. Fund equity for all other reporting is classified as “net
position”.
Fund Balance - Generally, fund balance represents the difference
between the current assets and current liabilities. The Town reserves
those portions of fund balance that are legally segregated for a specific
31 
Page 35
future use or which do not represent available, spendable resources and
therefore, are not available for appropriation or expenditure. Unassigned
fund balance indicates that portion of fund balance that is available for
appropriation in future periods. 
The Town’s fund balance classification policies and procedures are as
follows: 
1) Nonspendable funds are either unspendable in the current form
(i.e., inventory, petty cash, or prepaid items) or can never be spent
(i.e., perpetual care).
2) Restricted funds are used solely for the purpose in which the fund
was established. In the case of special revenue funds, these funds
are created by statute or otherwise have external constraints on
how the funds can be expended. 
3) Committed funds are reported and expended as a result of motions
passed by the highest decision making authority in the government
(i.e., Town Meeting).
4) Assigned funds are used for specific purposes as established by
management. These funds, which include encumbrances, have
been assigned for specific goods and services ordered but not yet
paid for. This account also includes fund balance voted to be used
in the subsequent fiscal year. 
5) Unassigned funds are available to be spent in future periods. 
When an expenditure is incurred that would qualify for payment from multi-
ple fund balance types, the Town uses the following order to liquidate lia-
bilities: restricted, committed, assigned, and unassigned. 
Net Position - Net position represents the difference between assets/ 
deferred outflows and liabilities/deferred inflows. Net investment in capital
assets, net of related debt, consist of capital assets, net of accumulated
depreciation, reduced by the outstanding balances of any borrowing used
for the acquisition, construction or improvement of those assets. Net posi-
tion is reported as restricted when there are limitations imposed on their
use either through the enabling legislation adopted by the Town or through
external restrictions imposed by creditors, grantors, or laws or regulations of
other governments. The remaining net position is reported as unrestricted. 
L. Use of Estimates
The preparation of basic financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures for contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the basic
financial statements, and the reported amounts of the revenues and
32 
Page 36
expenditures/expenses during the fiscal year. Actual results could vary
from estimates that were used. 
2. Stewardship, Compliance, and Accountability
A. Budgetary Information
At the annual town meeting, the Chief Financial Officer presents an oper-
ating and capital budget for the proposed expenditures of the fiscal year
commencing the following July 1. The budget, as enacted by town meet-
ing, establishes the legal level of control and specifies that certain appro-
priations are to be funded by particular revenues. The original budget is
amended during the fiscal year at special town meetings as required by
changing conditions. In cases of extraordinary or unforeseen expenses, 
the Finance Committee is empowered to transfer funds from the Reserve
Fund (a contingency appropriation) to a departmental appropriation. 
“Extraordinary” includes expenses which are not in the usual line, or are
great or exceptional. “Unforeseen” includes expenses which are not fore-
seen as of the time of the annual meeting when appropriations are voted. 
Departments are limited to the line items as voted. Certain items may
exceed the line item budget as approved if it is for an emergency and for
the safety of the general public. These items are limited by the Massa-
chusetts General Laws and must be raised in the next year’s tax rate. 
Formal budgetary integration is employed as a management control
device during the year for the General Fund and Proprietary Funds. Effec-
tive budgetary control is achieved for all other funds through provisions of
the Massachusetts General Laws. 
At year-end, appropriation balances lapse, except for certain unexpended
capital items and encumbrances which will be honored during the subse-
quent year. 
B. Budgetary Basis
The General Fund final appropriation appearing on the “Budget and
Actual” page of the fund financial statements represents the final amended
budget after all reserve fund transfers and supplemental appropriations. 
C. Budget/GAAP Reconciliation
The budgetary data for the general and proprietary funds is based upon
accounting principles that differ from generally accepted accounting prin-
ciples (GAAP). Therefore, in addition to the GAAP basis financial state-
ments, the results of operations of the general fund are presented in
accordance with budgetary accounting principles to provide a meaningful
comparison to budgetary data.

3. Cash and Short-Term Investments
Custodial Credit Risk - Deposits. Custodial credit risk is the risk that in the
event of a bank failure, the Town’s and Contributory Retirement System’s
(the System) deposits may not be returned. Massachusetts General Law
Chapter 44, Section 55, limits the Town’s deposits “in a bank or trust
company or banking company to an amount not exceeding sixty percent of
the capital and surplus of such bank or trust company or banking company, 
unless satisfactory security is given to it by such bank or trust company or
banking company for such excess.” The Town’s deposit policy for custodial
credit risk is to limit unsecured bank deposits to no more than 5% of the
institution’s assets and no more than 10% of the municipality’s cash. 
Massachusetts General Law Chapter 32, Section 23, limits the System’s
deposits “in a bank or trust company to an amount not exceeding ten percent
of the capital and surplus of such bank or trust company.” The System does
not have a deposit policy for custodial credit risk. 
As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, $22,067,235 and $7,928,955
of the Town’s and System’s bank balances of $79,085,810 and $12,274,937
respectively, was exposed to custodial credit risk as uninsured or
uncollateralized. 
Of the Town’s balance exposed to custodial credit risk, $17,393,114 is on
deposit with Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust. 
Of the System’s balance exposed to custodial credit risk, $2,100,000 is on
deposit with the Pension Reserve Investment Trust and $5,828,955 is on
deposit with Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust.

4. Investments
A. Credit Risk
Generally, credit risk is the risk that an issuer of an investment will not
fulfill its obligation to the holder of the investment. For short-term invest-
ments that were purchased using surplus revenues, Massachusetts
General Law, Chapter 44, Section 55, limits the Town’s investments to the
top rating issued by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating
organization (NRSROs).
Presented below (in thousands) is the actual rating as of year-end for
each investment of the Town. (All federal agency securities have an
implied credit rating of AAA):

Federal agency securities 3,101 3,101  -  -
Total investments $ 25,300 $ 3,539 $ 1,317 $ 20,444 
Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 32, Section 23, limits the invest-
ment of System funds, to the extent not required for current disburse-
ments, in the PRIT Fund or in securities, other than mortgages or collat-
eral loans, which are legal for the investment of funds in savings banks
under the laws of the Commonwealth, provided that no more than the
established percentage of assets, is invested in any one security. 
At December 31, 2014, the Contributory Retirement System maintained its
investments in the State Investment Pool* with a fair value of $247,837,495. 
This investment type is not rated. 
*Fair value is the same as the value of the pool share. The Pension Reserves Investment
Trust was created under Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 32, Section 22, in
December 1983. The Pension Reserves Investment Trust is operated under contract with
a private investment advisor, approved by the Pension Reserves Investment Manage-
ment Board. The Pension Reserves Investment Management Board shall choose an
investment advisor by requesting proposals from advisors and reviewing such proposals
based on criteria adopted under Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 30B. 
37 
Page 41
B. Custodial Credit Risk
The custodial credit risk for investments is the risk that, in the event of the
failure of the counterparty (e.g., broker-dealer) to a transaction, a govern-
ment will not be able to recover the value of its investment or collateral
securities that are in the possession of another party. The Town’s policy
for custodial credit risk is to limit investments to the state investment pool, 
U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. Agency obligations, and certificates of
deposit. The System does not have policies for custodial credit risk. 
The Town’s investments were exposed to custodial credit risk because the
related securities are uninsured, unregistered, and/or held by the Town’s
brokerage firm, which is also the Counterparty to these securities. The
Town manages this custodial credit risk with SIPC and excess SIPC. 
The System’s investments were exposed to custodial credit risk as unin-
sured and uncollateralized. However, these investments were held in the
State Investment Pool. 
C. Concentration of Credit Risk
The Town’s policy for concentration of credit risk is to limit investments in
a single financial institution to no more than 10% of the Town’s invest-
ments with the exception of U.S. Treasury obligations or investments fully
collateralized by U.S. Treasuries or agencies, and state pools. 
The Town’s investments in any one issuer (other than U.S. Treasury
securities and mutual funds) that represent 5% or more of total invest-
ments, was $1,702,209 held in Federal Home Loan Mortgage notes and
$1,399,449 held in Federal Home Loan Bank notes .
Massachusetts General Law Chapter 32, Section 23 limits the amount the
System may invest in any one issuer or security type, with the exception of
the PRIT Fund. 
The Contributory Retirement System does not have an investment in one
issuer greater than 5% of total investments. 
D. Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will
adversely affect the fair value of an investment. Generally, the longer
the maturity of an investment, the greater the sensitivity of its fair value
to changes in market interest rates. The Town’s policy for interest rate risk
is to structure the portfolio so securities mature to meet all operating
requirements that may be reasonably anticipated, thus avoiding the need
to sell securities on the open market prior to maturity. The System does
not have a formal investment policy that limits investment maturities as a
38 
Page 42
means of managing its exposure to fair value losses arising from increas-
ing interest rates. 
Information about the sensitivity of the fair values of the Town’s invest-
ments to market interest rate fluctuations is as follows (in thousands):

The Retirement system does not maintain investments that are sensitive
to market interest rate fluctuations. 
E. Foreign Currency Risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates
will adversely affect the fair value of an investment. The Town and System
do not have policies for foreign currency risk. 
5. Taxes Receivable
Real estate and personal property taxes are levied and based on values
assessed on January 1st of every year. Assessed values are established by
the Board of Assessor’s for 100% of the estimated fair market value. Taxes
are due on a quarterly basis and are subject to penalties and interest if they
are not paid by the respective due date. Real estate and personal property
taxes levied are recorded as receivables in the fiscal year they relate to. 
Fourteen days after the due date for the final tax bill for real estate taxes, a
demand notice may be sent to the delinquent taxpayer. Fourteen days after
the demand notice has been sent, the tax collector may proceed to file a lien
against the delinquent taxpayers’ property. The Town has an ultimate right to
foreclose on property for unpaid taxes. Personal property taxes cannot be
secured through the lien process.

Fund balances are segregated to account for resources that are either not
available for expenditure in the future or are legally set aside for a specific
future use. 
The Town implemented GASB Statement No. 54 (GASB 54), Fund Balance
Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions, which enhances the
usefulness of fund balance information by providing clearer fund balance
classifications that can be more consistently applied and by clarifying existing
governmental fund type definitions. 
The following types of fund balances are reported at June 30, 2015: 
Nonspendable - Represents amounts that cannot be spent because they
are either (a) not in spendable form or (b) legally or contractually required to
be maintained intact. This fund balance classification includes general fund
reserves for prepaid expenditures, petty cash, and nonmajor governmental
fund reserves for the principal portion of permanent trust funds. 
Restricted - Represents amounts that are restricted to specific purposes by
constraints imposed by creditors, grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations
of other governments, or constraints imposed by law through constitutional
provisions or enabling legislation. This fund balance classification includes
general fund encumbrances funded by bond issuances, various special
revenue funds, and the income portion of permanent trust funds. 
Committed - Represents amounts that can only be used for specific pur-
poses pursuant to constraints imposed by formal action of the Town’s highest
level of decision-making authority. This fund balance classification includes
general fund encumbrances for non-lapsing, special article appropriations
approved at Town Meeting, stabilization funds set aside by Town Meeting
vote for future capital acquisitions and improvements (now reported as part of
the general fund per GASB 54), and various special revenue funds. 
Assigned - Represents amounts that are constrained by the Town’s intent to
use these resources for a specific purpose. This fund balance classification
includes general fund encumbrances that have been established by various
Town departments for the expenditure of current year budgetary financial
resources upon vendor performance in the subsequent budgetary period. 
Unassigned - Represents amounts that are available to be spent in future
periods.

18. General Fund Unassigned Fund Balance
The unassigned general fund balance reported on the balance sheet is
stated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),
which differs in certain respects from the Massachusetts Uniform Municipal
Accounting System (UMAS). The following paragraphs summarize the major
differences. 
Massachusetts General Laws include provisions to allow municipalities to over-
expend certain appropriations if they are incurred in an emergency situation
and for the safety of the public. The most common example involves the “snow
and ice” appropriation. All such overexpenditures, however, must be funded in
the subsequent year’s tax rate. 
The accompanying financial statements include an estimate for future poten-
tial tax refunds, which is not recognized under UMAS. 
The following summarizes the specific differences between GAAP basis and
budgetary basis of reporting the general fund unassigned fund balance:

20. Commitments and Contingencies
Outstanding Legal Issues - There are several pending legal issues in which
the Town is involved. The Town’s management is of the opinion that the
potential future settlement of such claims would not materially affect its finan-
cial statements taken as a whole. 
52 
Page 56
Grants - Amounts received or receivable from grantor agencies are subject to
audit and adjustment by grantor agencies, principally the federal government. 
Any disallowed claims, including amounts already collected, may constitute
a liability of the applicable funds. The amount of expenditures which may be
disallowed by the grantor cannot be determined at this time, although the
Town expects such amounts, if any, to be immaterial. 
Abatements - There are several cases pending before the Appellate Tax
Board in regard to alleged discrepancies in property assessments. According
to the Town’s counsel, the probable outcome of these cases at the present
time is indeterminable. 
21. Post-Employment Healthcare and Life Insurance Benefits
Other Post-Employment Benefits
GASB Statement 45, Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for
Post-Employment Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires governments to
account for other post-employment benefits (OPEB), primarily healthcare, 
on an accrual basis rather than on a pay-as-you-go basis. The effect is the
recognition of an actuarially required contribution as an expense on the
Statement of Activities when a future retiree earns their post-employment
benefits, rather than when they use their post-employment benefit. To the
extent that an entity does not fund their actuarially required contribution, a
post-employment benefit liability is recognized on the Statement of Net
Position over time. 
A. Plan Description
In addition to providing the pension benefits described, the Town pro- 
vides post-employment healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired
employees through the Town’s plan. The benefits, benefit levels, employee
contributions and employer contributions are governed by Chapter 32 of the
Massachusetts General Laws. As of July 1, 2014, the actuarial valuation
date, approximately 1,495 retirees and 1,695 active employees meet the
eligibility requirements. The plan does not issue a separate financial report. 
B. Benefits Provided
The Town provides medical, prescription drug, mental health/substance
abuse and life insurance to retirees and their covered dependents. All
active employees who retire from the Town and meet the eligibility criteria
will receive these benefits. 
53 
Page 57
C. Funding Policy
Retirees contribute various percentages of the cost of the health plan, as
determined by the Town. The Town contributes the remainder of the
health plan costs on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
D. Annual OPEB Costs and Net OPEB Obligation
The Town’s fiscal 2015 annual OPEB expense is calculated based on the
annual required contribution of the employer (ARC), an amount actuarially
determined in accordance with the parameters of GASB Statement No. 45. 
The ARC represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing basis, is
projected to cover the normal cost per year and amortize the unfunded
actuarial liability over a period of thirty years. The following table shows the
components of the Town’s annual OPEB cost for the year ending June 30, 
2015, the amount actually contributed to the plan, and the change in the
Town’s net OPEB obligation based on an actuarial valuation as of July 1, 
2014.

E. Funded Status and Funding Progress
The funded status of the plan as of July 1, 2014, the date of the most
recent actuarial valuation was as follows: 
Actuarial accrued liability (AAL)
Actuarial value of plan assets (7/1/14)
Unfunded actuarial accrued liability (UAAL)
Funded ratio (actuarial value of plan assets/AAL)
Covered payroll (active plan members)

(2,516,635)
$  286,128,910
0.9%
$  111,670,636
256%
Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of
reported amount and assumptions about the probability of occurrence of
events far into the future. Examples included assumptions about future
employment, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend. Amounts deter-
mined regarding the funded status of the plan and the annual required
contributions of the employer are subject to continual revision as actual
results are compared with past expectations and new estimates are made
about the future. The schedule of funding progress, presented as required
supplementary information following the notes to the financial statements, 
presents multiyear trend information that shows whether the actuarial
value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to the
actuarial accrued liabilities for benefits. 
F. Actuarial Methods and Assumptions
Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the
plan as understood by the Town and the plan members and include the
types of benefits provided at the time of each valuation and the historical
pattern of sharing of benefit costs between the Town and plan members
to that point. The actuarial methods and assumptions used include tech-
niques that are designed to reduce short-term volatility in actuarial accrued
liabilities and the actuarial value of assets, consistent with the long-term
perspective of the calculations. 
In the July 1, 2014 actuarial valuation the projected unit credit cost method
was used. The actuarial value of assets was not determined as the Town
has not advance funded its obligation. The actuarial assumptions included a
4% investment rate of return and an initial annual healthcare cost trend rate
of 8% which decreases to a 5% long-term rate for all healthcare benefits
after five years. The amortization costs for the initial UAAL is a level per-
centage of payroll for a period of 30 years, on an open basis. This has been
calculated assuming the amortization payment increases at a rate of 4.0%.

22. Retirement System
The Town follows the provisions of GASB Statement No. 67 Financial
Reporting for Pension Plans – an amendment of GASB Statement No. 25
and GASB Statement No. 68, Accounting and Financial Reporting for
Pensions – an amendment of GASB Statement No. 27, with respect to the
employees’ retirement funds. 
A. Plan Description
The System is a member of the Massachusetts Contributory Retirement
Systems and is governed by Chapter 32 of the Massachusetts General
Laws. Because of the significance of its operational and financial relation-
ship with the Town, the System is included as a pension trust fund in the
Town’s basic financial systems. 
Substantially all employees of the Town (except teachers and administra-
tors under contract employed by the School Department) , the Framingham
Housing Authority , and MetroWest Regional Transit are members of the
Framingham Contributory Retirement System (the System), a cost sharing, 
multiple employer public employee retirement system (PERS). Eligible
employees must participate in the System. The pension plan provides
pension benefits, deferred allowances, and death and disability benefits. 
Chapter 32 of the Massachusetts General Laws establishes the authority
of the System, contribution percentages and benefits paid. 
The System is governed by a five-member board. The five members include
two appointed by the town, two elected by the members and retirees, and a
fifth member chosen by the other four members with the approval of the
Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission. The System
Retirement Board does not have the authority to amend benefit provisions. 
Membership of each plan consisted of the following at June 30, 2015: 
Retirees and beneficiaries receiving benefits
Terminated plan members entitled to but not yet
receiving benefits
Active plan members

B. Benefits Provided
The System provides for retirement allowance benefits up to a maximum
of 80% of a member's highest three-year average annual rate of regular
compensation for those hired prior to April 2, 2012 and the highest five
year average for those first becoming members of the MA System on or
after that date. Benefit payments are based upon a member's age, length
56 
Page 60
of creditable service, level of compensation and group classification. Mem-
bers become vested after 10 years of creditable service. A retirement
allowance may be received upon attaining 20 years of service. The plan
also provides for retirement at age 55 if the participant (1) has a record
of 10 years of creditable service, (2) was on the Town/City payroll on
January 1, 1978, (3) voluntarily left Town/City employment on or after that
date, and (4) left accumulated annuity deductions in the fund. A participant
who became a member on or after April 2, 2012 is eligible for a retirement
allowance upon 10 years creditable service and reaching ages 60 or 50
for groups 1 and 2, respectively. A retirement allowance consists of two
parts: an annuity and a pension. A member’s accumulated total deduc-
tions and a portion of the interest they generate constitute the annuity. 
The difference between the total retirement allowance and the annuity is
the pension. The average retirement benefit is approximately 80-85% 
pension and 15-20% annuity. 
Per Chapter 176 of the Acts of 2011, for members who retire on or after
April 2, 2012, if in the 5 years of creditable service immediately preceding
retirement, the difference in the annual rate of regular compensation
between any 2 consecutive years exceeds 100 percent, the normal yearly
amount of the retirement allowance shall be based on the average annual
rate of regular compensation received by the member during the period of
5 consecutive years preceding retirement. 
Employees who resign from service and who are not eligible to receive a
retirement allowance or are under the age of 55 are entitled to request a
refund of their accumulated total deductions. In addition, depending upon
the number of years of creditable service, such employees are entitled to
receive zero, fifty, or one hundred percent of the regular interest which
has accrued upon those deductions. However, effective July 1, 2010, 
members voluntarily withdrawing with less than 10 years of service get
credited interest each year at a rate of 3% and do not forfeit any interest
previously earned on contributions. 
C. Contributions
Participants contribute a set percentage of their gross regular compensation
annually. Employee contribution percentages are specified in Chapter 32 of
the Massachusetts General Laws. The employee’s individual contribution
percentage is determined by their date of entry into the system. In addition, 
all employees hired after January 1, 1979 contribute an additional 2% on all
gross regular compensation over the rate of $30,000 per year. The percent-
ages are as follows: 
Before January 1, 1975
January 1, 1975 - December 31, 1983
January 1, 1984 - June 30, 1996
Beginning July 1, 1996

Employers are required to contribute at actuarially determined rates as
accepted by the Public Employee Retirement Administration Commission
(PERAC).
The Town’s contribution to the System for the year ended June 30, 2015
was $11,806,955 which was equal to its annual required contribution. 
D. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accounting policies of the System as reflected in the accompanying
financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2015 conform to generally
accepted accounting principles for public employee retirement systems
(PERS). The more significant accounting policies of the System are
summarized below: 
Basis of Accounting - Contributory retirement system financial statements
are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting. Plan member contri-
butions are recognized as revenue in the period in which the members
provide services to the employer. Employer contributions are recognized
when due and the employer has made a formal commitment to provide the
contributions. Benefits and refunds are recognized when due and payable
in accordance with the terms of the plan. 
Investments
Investment Policy
Investments are reported at fair value in accordance with PERAC require-
ments. System assets are managed on a total return basis with a long-term
objective of achieving and maintaining a fully funded status for the benefits
provided through the pension plan. 
Rate of Return
For the year ended June 30, 2015, the annual money-weighted rate of
return on pension plan investments, net of pension plan investment
expenses, was 7.69%. The money-weighted rate of return expresses
investment performance, net of investment expense, adjusted for the
changing amounts actually invested. 
Net Pension Liability
For purposes of measuring the net pension liability, deferred outflows of
resources and deferred inflows of resources related to pensions, and
pension expense, information about the fiduciary net position of the
System and additions to/deductions from System’s fiduciary net position
have been determined on the same basis as they are reported by System. 
For this purpose, benefit payments (including refunds of employee
58 
Page 62
contributions) are recognized when due and payable in accordance with
benefit terms. Investments are reported at fair value. 
E. Net Pension Liability of Participating Employers
The components of the net pension liability of the participating employers
at June 30, 2015 were as follows (in thousands):
Net Pension Liability of Employers
Total pension liability
Plan fiduciary net position
Employers' net pension liability
Plan fiduciary net postion as a
percentage of total pension liability

Actuarial Assumptions
A summary of the actuarial assumptions as of the latest actuarial valuation
is shown below: 
January 1, 2014 rolled forward to
Valuation Date  December 31, 2014
Actuarial cost method  Entry Age
Actuarial assumptions:

Projected salary increases 4.25% for Group 1 and 4.75% for
Group 4
Inflation rate  Not explicitly assumed
Post-retirement cost-of-living adjustment 3% on first $12,000
Actuarial valuation of the ongoing Systems involves estimates of the
reported amounts and assumptions about probability of occurrence of
events far into the future. Examples include assumptions about future
employment mortality and future salary increases. Amounts determined
regarding the net pension liability are subject to continual revision as
actual results are compared with past expectations and new estimates
are made about the future. The actuarial assumptions used in the
December 31, 2014 valuation were based on the results of the most
recent actuarial experience study, dated January 1, 2014, which was for
the period January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013. 
Mortality rates were based on pre-retirement rates that reflect the RP-2000
Employees table projected 22 years with Scale AA (gender distinct). Post
retirement rates reflect the RP-200 Healthy Annuitant table projected
59 
Page 63
17 years with Scale AA (gender distinct). For disabled retirees, this table is
set forward 3 years for males. 
Target Allocations
The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was
selected from a best estimate range determined using the building block
approach. Under this method, an expected future real return range
(expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) is
calculated separately for each asset class. These ranges are combined to
produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected
future real rates of return net of investment expenses by the target asset
allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. The target alloca-
tion and best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major
class are summarized in the following table:

Discount Rate: The discount rate used to measure the total pension
liability was 7.75%. The projection of cash flows used to determine the
discount rate assumed that the plan member contributions will be made at
the current contribution rate and that employer contributions will be made
at contractually required rates, actuarially determined. Based on those
assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be
available to make all projected future benefit payments to current active
and inactive plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of
return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected
benefit payments to determine the total pension liability. 
Sensitivity of the proportionate share of the net pension liability to changes
in the discount rate: The following presents the Town’s proportionate
share of the net pension liability calculated using the discount rate of
7.75 percent, as well as what the Town’s proportionate share of the net
pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is

F. Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of
Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions
At June 30, 2015, the Town reported a liability of $ 88,609,000 for its
proportionate share of the net pension liability. The net pension liability
was measured as of December 31, 2014, and the total pension liability
used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial
valuation as of January 1, 2014. The Town’s proportion of the net pension
liability was based on a projection of the Town’s long-term share of con-
tributions to the pension plan relative to the projected contributions of all
participating employers, actuarially determined. At December 31, 2014, 
the Town’s proportion was 95.11 percent. 
For the year ended June 30, 2015, the Town recognized pension expense
of $9,337,000. In addition, the Town reported deferred outflows of
resources related to pensions from the following sources:

23. Massachusetts Teachers’ Retirement System (MTRS) 
A. Plan Description
The Massachusetts Teachers’ Retirement System (MTRS) is a public
employee retirement system (PERS) that administers a cost-sharing multi-
employer defined benefit plan, as defined in Governmental Accounting
Standards Board (GASB) Statement No. 67, Financial Reporting for
Pension Plans. MTRS is managed by the Commonwealth on behalf of
municipal teachers and municipal teacher retirees. The Commonwealth
is a nonemployer contributor and is responsible for all contributions and
future benefit requirements of the MTRS. The MTRS covers certified
teachers in cities (except Boston), towns, regional school districts, charter
schools, educational collaboratives, and Quincy College. The MTRS is
part of the Commonwealth’s reporting entity and does not issue a stand-
alone audited financial report. 
Management of MTRS is vested in the Massachusetts Teachers’ Retire-
ment Board (MTRB), which consists of seven members—two elected by the
MTRS members, one who is chosen by the six other MTRB members, the
State Treasurer (or their designee), the State Auditor (or their designee), a
member appointed by the Governor, and the Commissioner of Education (or
their designee), who serves ex-officio as the Chairman of the MTRB. 
B. Benefits Provided
MTRS provides retirement, disability, survivor, and death benefits to
members and their beneficiaries. Massachusetts General Laws (MGL) 
establishes uniform benefit and contribution requirements for all contributory
PERS. These requirements provide for superannuation retirement allow-
ance benefits up to a maximum of 80% of a member’s highest three-year
average annual rate of regular compensation. For employees hired after
April 1, 2012, retirement allowances are calculated on the basis of the last
five years or any five consecutive years, whichever is greater in terms of
compensation. Benefit payments are based upon a member’s age, length of
creditable service, and group creditable service, and group classification. 
The authority for amending these provisions rests with the Legislature. 
Members become vested after ten years of creditable service. A superan-
nuation retirement allowance may be received upon the completion of
twenty years of creditable service or upon reaching the age of 55 with ten
years of service. Normal retirement for most employees occurs at age 65. 
Most employees who joined the system after April 1, 2012 cannot retire
prior to age 60. 
The MTRS’ funding policies have been established by Chapter 32 of
the MGL. The Legislature has the authority to amend these policies. 
The annuity portion of the MTRS retirement allowance is funded by
62 
Page 66
employees, who contribute a percentage of their regular compensation. 
Costs of administering the plan are funded out of plan assets. 
C. Contributions
Member contributions for MTRS vary depending on the most recent date
of membership:

1975 - 1983
1984 to 6/30/1996
7/1/1996 to present
7/1/2001 to present
1979 to present 
% of Compensation
5% of regular compensation
7% of regular compensation
8% of regular compensation
9% of regular compensation
11% of regular compensation (for teachers
hired after 7/1/01 and those accepting provi-
sions of Chapter 114 of the Acts of 2000) 
An additional 2% of regular compensation in
excess of $30,000
D. Actuarial Assumptions
The total pension liability for the June 30, 2014 measurement date was
determined by an actuarial valuation as of January 1, 2014 rolled forward
to June 30, 2014. The total pension liability for the June 30, 2013 meas-
urement date was determined by an actuarial valuation as of January 1, 
2014, rolled back to June 30, 2013. This valuation used the following
assumptions: 
  (a) 8.0% investment rate of return, (b) 3.5% interest rate credited to the
annuity savings fund and (c) 3.0% cost of living increase per year. 
  Salary increases are based on analyses of past experience but range
from 4.0% to 7.5% depending on length of service. 
  Mortality rates were as follows: 
 Pre-retirement - reflects RP-2000 Employees table adjusted for
“white-collar” employment projected 22 years with Scale AA
(gender distinct) 
 Post-retirement - reflects RP-2000 Healthy Annuitant table adjusted
for large annuity amounts and projected 17 years with Scale AA
(gender distinct) 
 Disability – reflects RP-2000 Healthy Annuitant table adjusted for
large annuity amounts and projected 17 years with Scale AA
(gender distinct) set forward 3 years for males. 
Investment assets of the MTRS are with the Pension Reserves Investment
Trust (PRIT) Fund. The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan
63 
Page 67
investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-
estimate ranges of expected future rates of return are developed for each
major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term
expected rate of return by weighting the expected future rates of return by
the target asset allocation percentage. Best estimates of geometric rates
of return for each major asset class included in the PRIT Fund’s target
asset allocation as of June 30, 2014 and 2013 are summarized in the
following table:

E. Discount Rate
The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 8.0%.
The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed
that plan member contributions will be made at the current contribution
rates and the Commonwealth’s contributions will be made at rates equal
to the difference between actuarially determined contribution rates and the
member rates. Based on those assumptions, the net position was pro-
jected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of
current plan members. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return
on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit
payments to determine the total pension liability. 
F. Sensitivity Analysis
The following illustrates the sensitivity of the collective net pension liability
to changes in the discount rate. In particular, the table presents the MTRS
collective net pension liability assuming it was calculated using a single
discount rate that is one-percentage-point lower or one-percentage-point
higher than the current discount rate (amounts in thousands):

G. Special Funding Situation
The Commonwealth is a nonemployer contributor and is required by
statute to make all actuarial determined employer contributions on behalf
of the member employers. Therefore, these employers are considered to
be in a special funding situation as defined by GASB Statement No. 68, 
Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions (GASB 68) and the
Commonwealth is a nonemployer contributing entity in MTRS. Since the
employers do not contribute directly to MTRS, there is no net pension
liability to recognize for each employer. 
H. Town Proportions
In fiscal year 2014 (the most recent measurement period), the Town’s pro-
portionate share of the MTRS’ collective net pension liability and pension
expense was $164,027,046 and $11,395,746 respectively, based on a pro-
portionate share of 1.03%. As required by GASB 68, the Town has recog-
nized its portion of the collective pension expense as both a revenue and
expense in the government-wide Statement of Activities
24. Self-insurance
The Town self-insures against claims for workers compensation, unemploy-
ment and most employee health coverage. Annual estimated requirements for
claims are provided in the Town’s annual operating budget. 
Health Insurance
The Town contracts with an insurance carrier for excess liability coverage
and an insurance consultant for claims processing. Under the terms of its
insurance coverage, the Town is liable for claims up to $150,000 per incident, 
with a maximum lifetime coverage of $2,000,000. The claims liability repre-
sents an estimate of claims incurred but unpaid at year-end, based on past
historical costs and claims paid subsequent to year-end. 
Changes in the aggregate liability for claims for the year ended June 30, 2015
are as follows: 
Dental
Coverage
Claims liability, beginning of year  $  4,221,683
Claims incurred/recognized
in fiscal year 2015  3,057,414
Claims paid in fiscal year 2015  (3,611,854)
Claims liability, end of year  $  3,667,243
65 
Page 69
The $3,667,243 estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported includes
only an estimate for known loss events expected to later be presented as
claims. The Town is unable to estimate the amount of unknown loss events
expected to become claims and expected future developments on claims
already reported. 
25. Risk Management
The Town is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage
to and destruction of assets; errors and omissions; and natural disasters for
which the government carries commercial insurance. There were no signifi-
cant reductions in insurance coverage from the previous year and have been
no material settlements in excess of coverage in any of the past three fiscal
years. 
26. Beginning Net Position Restatement
The beginning (July 1, 2014) net position of the Town has been restated as
