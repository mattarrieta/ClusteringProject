Report

get there, but there are ways to prioritize
this,” said Colin Jones, senior policy
analyst for MassBudget. “All the evi-
dence says if you take under-resourced
kids, low-income kids, and put them in
high-quality early-education programs
you can see an impact.”
The release of the MassBudget report
on Thursday comes a day after Presi-
dent Joe Biden rolled out a $1.8 trillion
proposal named by the White House the
“American Families Plan” that would in-
vest $200 billion for free, universal pre-
school for 3- and 4-year-olds and anoth-
er $225 billion to raise the pay of early
educators and make day care more af-
fordable for families.
Like the model used by MassBudget,
the Biden plan would cap family fees at
7% of household income, and if it were
to pass Congress would wind up cover-
ing 45% or more of the new costs in
Massachusetts, Jones said.
“Now’s a great time to think about
doing it,” Jones said, referencing the po-
tential influx of billions in federal aid.
“We would need to set a multi-year plan
to get here.”
According to the report, the total cost
of providing services to 287,600 chil-
dren, or about 80% of the children un- 
der 5, would be $7.56 billion. The report
estimates that families, with a cap and a
sliding scale for fees, would contribute
$1.27 billion and the state currently allo-
cates another $1.27 billion a year to early
education and care.
That would leave a gap of just over $5
billion.
The center recommends a sliding fee
scale for families that would kick in for
households earning at least half of the
statewide median income, or $60,000
for a family of four. Child care would be
free for families earning less.
“The state could start with the fam-
ilies that need it the most, provide it and
expand it over time and hopefully see
the impact,” Jones said.
The report describes a high-quality
program as one with a strong curricu-
lum and professional development op-
portunities, small class sizes, well-com-
pensated teachers and a full-time, year-
round schedule that aligns with the
schedules of working parents.
The full cost of providing this type of
care and schooling through Head Start,
subsidized centers and pre-school pro-
grams offered through local districts
would average $28,267 a year per child,
with infants costing more and pre-
schoolers less, the report found.
While there were roughly 8,100 state
licensed early education and care pro-
grams before the pandemic, MassBud-
get said the state reported in February
Records
Continued from Page 1A
District 4 City Council-
or Michael Cannon re-
peatedly criticized the
administration for being
“clearly dishonest” in re-
gards to the request for
emails relating to Wong’s
departure.
“Quite clearly, and the
state agreed, the city was
dishonest there,”  said
Cannon.
Spicer rebutted Can-
non’s assertion, telling
him to “stop insinuating
I’m a liar.”
“I do not lie,” she said.
Councilors stressed
there is a long-standing
cultural problem with ac-
cess to public records in
the city.
“We do not have a
friendly public records
system,” said City Coun-
cil Chairman George
King. “...We have to do a
lot better.”
Some councilors have
been unsuccessful in
their attempts to access
information. District 7
City Councilor Margareth
Shepard was left speech-
less when she was denied
records about city-owned
properties and crashes.
Shepard called for poli-
cies to make it easier to
get information.
District 8 City Council-
or John Stefanini cited a
resident who was seeking
traffic statistics in their
neighborhood and was
told they would have to
submit a records request.
The resident opted
against filing the request,
he said.
Many municipalities 
post those statistics on
their websites and don’t
require a records request,
said Stefanini.
“We lost their ability
and insight on an inter-
section they go through
every single day because
we made the barrier too
great,” he said. “We’ve got
to make it easier for peo-
ple to get access to basic
information.”
Councilor At-Large Ja-
net Leombruno said pub-
lic records requests
should go through the
City Clerk’s office, like
they do in other munici-
palities.
“I  think that would
really solve a huge part of
the problem here,” she
said
The Ordinance and
Rules subcommittee,
which Stefanini chairs,
on Wednesday signed off
on policy upgrades aimed
at increasing transparen-
cy in the city’s govern-
ment. The full City Coun-
cil is expected to take up
the policy changes in the
coming weeks.
In his memorandum,
Stefanini said the city ex-
ecutive and legislative 
branches are among the
least accessible and
transparent local govern-
ments in the state.
Stefanini’s  proposal
including having the City
Clerk respond to council-
related public records re-
quests, post all proposed
and passed measures and
roll call votes on the
council web page and
post all contracts and li-
censes on the website.
The disclosure of ben-
eficial and financial inter-
est in certain proposed
developments, contracts
and licenses would be
posted on the website in
an accessible and search-
able format, according to
Stefanini’s proposal.
The plan recommends
the mayor convene a
committee of community
leaders, elected officials
and residents to identify
and implement best prac-
tices for transparency
and train multiple-mem-
ber bodies on those best
practices.
“Access to information
is a basic foundation for
trust in government,”
Stefanini said Thursday.
Show her your
never-ending
love.

that as many as one in six of those pro-
grams had not reopened, further exac-
erbating the crisis.
The “American Rescue Plan” passed
by Congress shortly after Biden took of-
fice is expected to deliver more than
$500 million for child care to Massachu-
setts to help centers regroup from the
pandemic, which also resulted in re-
duced capacities in addition to the clo-
sures.
The center’s report also recommends
prioritizing investments in communi-
ties of color, where Black and Latinx
families are more likely to be lower-in-
come and their children have unequal 
access to quality education that has
long-lasting impacts.
“The system is not meeting families
with what they need. It’s difficult to ac-
cess, particularly in rural areas and low-
income areas, and it’s extremely unaf-
fordable,” Jones said.
The Legislature in this year’s fiscal
2021 budget also created a Early Educa-
tion and Care Economic Review Com-
mission, and House Education Commit-
tee Chair Rep. Alice Peisch said Monday
night she anticipated the commission
would have recommendations by the
end of the year.

Article V: 
Section 32 
Health and Safety
Nuisance Noise Ordinance
Effective January 1, 2020
32.01 Purpose
The Massachusetts Association of Health Boards finds that chronic or repeated exposure
to excessive noise is recognized by public health experts as a hazard to both physical
and mental health. It has been linked to a range of non-auditory health effects including
annoyance, sleep disturbance, cardiovascular diseases, and impairment of cognitive
performance in children. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988259~ 
The purpose of this Noise Ordinance is to allow the City of Framingham, Massachusetts
(the City) to establish reasonable guidelines, restrictions and limitations to maintain
acceptable noise conditions within the City. 
This ordinance defines noise criteria limits and restrictions for the purposes of (1) 
maintaining acceptable existing conditions, equipment operations, social interactions, 
and avoidance of disruption of the peace, and (2) managing and controlling potential
future noise conditions in the City stemming from development of new properties, 
equipment operations, and infrastructure. 
This ordinance is not intended to define safe noise levels to protect people's hearing or
avoid auditory damages from loud noises either within the workplace or from private
activities. As such, this ordinance is not intended to maintain public health and safety
with respect to noise. 
To enforce this Ordinance, the City may seek civil penalties pursuant to M.G.L. c. 40, §
21D and/or misdemeanor criminalpenalties permitted under M.G.L. c. 272, § 53, and
may seek injunctions to prohibit current and future noise. 
Therefore, it shall be unlawful for a person or persons to knowingly generate, or allow
continued generation of noise levels which exceed the criteria limits found in Section
32.03, 32.04 32.05 or 32.06, except under conditions defined in Section 32.09, when
measured at a receiving party's property line or at any location on the receiving
property, as defined by the applicable Noise Determination methods found in Sections
32.07 and 32.08
Nuisance Noise Ordinance  Page 1of 12
Page 27
32.02A Acoustical Terms Definitions
Community noise is generated by natural and man-made sources such as transportation
systems, industrial processes, construction operations, building air handling systems, 
power generation, agricultural processes, landscaping machinery, human activities, 
meteorological conditions, etc. In general, noise can be quantified by its magnitudinal
(loudness), tonal (frequency) and temporal (time) characteristics. The following are
definitions of terms typically used to describe community noise: 
SOUND DEFINITIONS
SOUND is a physical parameter which is produced when a vibrating surface transfers
energy in the form of air pressure waves which fluctuate above and below barometric
pressure to such a degree and within a frequency range that it can be perceived by the
human auditory system (i.e. sound can be heard.)
SOUND LEVEL METER (SLM)—Asound level meter is a calibrated electrical device used
to measure the loudness of noise. For the purposes of this bylaw, a SLM must be
capable of measuring and expressing noise levels in A-weighted decibels using an RMS
"slow" time constant in accordance with Type 2 or better accuracy requirements of ANSI
Standard S1.4. In addition, an "integrating" SLM must be used if any time-averaged
noise metrics (such as Leq or Ln percentiles) are to be reported. 
AUDIBLE FREQUENCY RANGE (and A-weighting) —Human beings can perceive noise
only if the fluctuating air pressure waves are within the so-called "audible frequency
range" of about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (Hertz, orcycles-per-second). However, people do
not hear noise equally well at all frequencies. As such, a frequency weighting
adjustment has been standardized in ANSI Standard S1.42 to account for humans
responding less sensitively to lower and higher frequency ranges. This frequency
weighted adjustment is referred to as "A-weighting", with results expressed as A-
weighted decibels, or d6(A).
DECIBELS (dB) —The magnitude or loudness of noise is expressed in units of decibels
(d6). Decibels relate the actual fluctuating air pressure levels against a standardized
reference air pressure level of 20micro-pascals. Human beings can hear noise over a
tremendously large range of air pressure so the use of a decibel scale (from about 0 dB
to 140 dB) is used for convenience. Zero decibels represents the "threshold of hearing",
while at the other extreme, pain and hearing damage can occur at noise levels of about
140 decibels. 
EQUIVALENT SOUND LEVEL (Leq) —The Leq represents the energy-averaged noise level
over some time period of interest. The Leq is expressed in dBA, and the time period
over which the Leq value applies should also be stated, i.e., Leq (lmin) represents a one-
minute average; Leq (24h) represents a 24-hour average, etc. 
Nuisance Noise Ordinance  Page Z of 12
Page 28
PURE TONE —Any sound which can be distinctly heard as a single pitch or a set of single
pitches. For the purposes of this chapter, a "pure tone" shall exist if an octave-band
analysis indicates one octave-band or more over both the band above and below. 
TONAL SOUND -Any sound that is judged by a listener to have the characteristics of a
pure tone, whine, hum or buzz. 
NOISE DEFINITIONS
NOISE is defined as "unwanted sound" which can occur when a source is either too
loud, uncontrollable, conveys unwanted information, masks-out other desirable sound, 
occurs at unacceptable times, or has annoying characteristics. 
BACKGROUND NOISE — is the prevailing or pre-existing noise conditions that can be
measured at a given location of interest without the contribution the noise source of
concern. 
CLEARLY AUDIBLE -means any sound that can be detected by a person using his or her
unaided hearing faculties. (As an example, if the sound source under investigation is a
portable or personal vehicular sound amplification or reproduction device, the
enforcement officer need not determine the title of a song, specific words, or the artist
performing the song. The detection of the rhythmic bass component of the music is
sufficient to constitute a clearly audible sound).
NOISE POLLUTION — A condition caused by a noise source that increases noise levels
ten (10) dB(A) or more above background noise level except that it the noise source
produces a tonal sound an increase at five (5) dB(A) or more above background noise
level shall be considered sufficient to cause noise pollution. 
NUISANCE NOISE —Nuisance typically exhibits aspects such as pure tone squealing or
whining, loud impulsive noises, repetitive thumping, low-frequency airborne vibrations, 
etc. Nuisance noise is defined qualitatively by listing specific examples, as in Section
32.03 of this Ordinance. 
STATIONERY NOISE SOURCE —Sources that emit noise on a continuous or repeatable
basis and that are located in fixed positions. Example stationary noise sources would
include, but are not limited to, building mechanical (HVAC) systems, power
transformers, commercial processing machinery, etc.

12. Construction and/or demolition activities. It is understood that construction and
demolition are inherently noisy activities which will likely be heard by adjacent
residents and business operators. As such, the intent is to balance the needs for
the construction contractors to perform the necessary work with the needs of
the community for peace and quiet. (See Table #2 -Construction Noise Criteria
Limits -for Hours.)
32.04 Stationary Noise Sources
Stationary sources of noise may include, but are not limited to, building HVAC systems, 
power generation facilities, industrial equipment, water or sewage pump stations, 
railroad and subway lay-over facilities, electric power transformers, commercial
factories and plants, truck depots, and recreational events. The noise level emitted by
stationary noise sources shall not exceed the limits contained in Table 1when measured
at the property line of the receiving property.

Section 32.05 Construction Noise Sources
In general, construction and/or demolition activities shall only be permitted to occur
within the City during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. However, it is understood that
construction and demolition are inherently noisy activities which will likely be heard by
adjacent residents and business operators during short periods of time. As such, the
intent of this section is to balance the needs for the construction contractors to perform
the necessary work with the needs of the community for peace and quiet. 
Therefore, cumulative noise generated by construction and/or demolition activities and
operations shall not exceed the limits contained in Table 2 when evaluated at the
property line of the receiving property, nor shall the noise emission level of any
individual piece of construction equipment exceed the noise emission limits contained
in Table 2 when measured at a distance of 50 feet from the loudest side of the piece of
equipment.

Notes: Criteria approach taken from FHWA Roadway Construction Noise Handbook (FHWA, 2006).
1. X10 noise levels shall be measured over a period of 20 minutes. 
2. Background (Bkgd) L10 noise levels should be measured prior to construction commencing in the field
or without the noise source in question operating. 
3. L10 noise levels measurements can be estimated if an integrating noise meter is not available by
determining the average or leq noise level plus 3 dBA. 
4. Table 2 noise limits do not apply to roadway construction activities. 
(*) Except when determined necessary by the City Council to protect public safety.

32.07 Nuisance Noises Determination
It shall be unlawful to knowingly generate, or allow continued generation of, noise as
listed in Section 32.03. 
To be applicable, the police officer must hear for him/herself the noise source in
question. The police officer must take conditional, circumstantial and extenuating
factors into account. Time of day is not to be considered an extenuating circumstance. 
The following are examples of extenuating circumstances: 
1. The necessity of the noise source to continue to operate. 
2. The quality of the noise, e.g., volume, pitch, and intensity of the noise
complained of. 
3. The duration of time that the noise is expected to continue. 
32.08 Noise Compliance Measurements Determination
If fines do not result in compliance with this ordinance, or it becomes necessary to
collect quantitative noise level measurements in order to demonstrate compliance or
exceedance of the various noise criteria limits contained in this ordinance, they must be
collected in accordance with accepted practices and procedures as recommended in
ASTM Standards E1686-03, E1780-04, and E1014-84, using a sound level meter (SLM) 
capable of meeting or exceeding ANSI Standard S1.4 for Type 2 accuracy. 
Nuisance Noise Ordinance  Page 9 of 12
Page 35
Noise data shall be collected using a calibrated SLM using a "slow" time constant with
results expressed in A-weighted decibels (dBAs). The minimum information necessary
to collect and report shall include the following: 
1. The make and model of SLM and portable calibrator used for the noise readings
2. The date which the SLM was last certified by the manufacturer, or other
independent calibration laboratory, as meeting ANSI S1.4StandardsforType 2
or better accuracy requirements (should be within previous two years).
3. TheSLM calibration readings obtained prior to, and immediately following, 
performing the compliance noise measurements. 
4. The type of windscreen used to cover the microphone. 
5. The height at which the noise readings were collected (should be at least 5 feet
above ground), and an estimate of the distance (in feet) from the noise source to
the SLM. 
6. The time of day, date, and duration of noise data collected by the SLM. 
7. An indication of the background noise level collected in the absence of the noise
source in question. 
8. A brief description of the meteorological conditions during the noise readings
including wind speed and direction, air temperature, precipitation, and ground
cover conditions. 
9. A clear and concise comparison of the measured noise level data (expressed in
dBAs) versus the applicable noise criteria limits contained in Tables 1, 2 and 3 of
this Ordinance. 
10. The findings and conclusions to be drawn from the noise compliance
measurements taken. 
32.09 Exceptions
The following cases shall be exceptions to the restrictions and criteria limits contained in
