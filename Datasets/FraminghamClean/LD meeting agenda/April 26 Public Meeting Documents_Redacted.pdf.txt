d/b/a The Aztec Restaurant
2 Waverly Street
Proposed Hours: Mon.-Thu. 10:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.; Fri. & Sat. 10:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.; Sun. 8
p.m. to 8 p.m. 
Alcohol Licensed Hours: Mon.-Sat. 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., Sun. 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. Patio 10 a.m. to 10
p.m. 
New floor site/plan was submitted to address department comments and concerns with
initial plan. 
Key elements: Increase outdoor seating for total of 30 and reduce indoor seating to 20, 
maintaining 50 seating occupancy. Currently allowed 16 outdoor seats per 2009 ZBA
decision. 
3 picnic tables/18 seats; 3 round tables/12 seats; 10 planter boxes, 6 umbrellas; no tent; 
no entertainment
Approved: PD Traffic-Safety Division & Treasurer/Collector
Comments/Conditional Approval
Police Dept: 
Alcohol served for on-premise consumption must be consumed on-premise within
enclosed area and not taken off-premise with the exception of re-corked bottles of wine
as per MGL. Barriers must be in place to protect customers from vehicular traffic, 
application submitted with pictures of concrete barriers would suffice. 
Fire Dept: 
New/additional outdoor seating shall not block any established exits from any building
including fire lanes, Hydrants, FDC, and exit discharge. 
Page 1 of 2 
Page 90
Health Dept.:
It is unclear from the Site Plan what the distancing between guests at different tables
will be. Patrons seated outside must be able to maintain at least 6 feet separation for
patrons sitting at other tables as well as high traffic areas (entrance to establishment).
Inspectional Services Dept.: See email dated 4/20/21 which states in part, 3. 
Framingham Inspectional Services will not oppose any combination of exterior and
interior seating that equals 50 total occupants. However, when temporary outdoor
seating expires, the owners of 2 Waverly Street are required to operate in accordance
with the decision issued in 2009, where outdoor seating is limited to 16 outdoor
occupants and the interior occupant load is lowered to 34, when offering exterior
seating (16 outdoor seats).

RE: Aztec Restaurant Temporary Outdoor Seating.
Image_074.pdf
Diane: 
After our conversation and pursuant to your note regarding the 2009 alcohol license I performed a thorough review of 
the permit history at 2 Waverly to establish allowable occupant loads in accordance with past building permits, 
certificates of inspection, Zoning Board of Appeals docs, and other archived information. With suspended zoning 
enforcement, and partial re‐opening of interior food service at restaurants, Framingham Inspectional Services is 
required to cap the total number of occupants (inside and outside) to the previous total occupant load allowed for that 
restaurant prior to the pandemic. This is to ensure that plumbing facilities, means of egress, parking, and 
occupant/square foot requirements are not exceeded. Therefore, Framingham Inspectional Services opposes the 
approval of the temporary outdoor seating at 2 Waverly Street for the following reasons: 
1. From 2010 to 2020, the occupant load for the Aztec Restaurant was 50 occupants in accordance with the 
certificate of inspections issued to the owner. However, in 2009, the Framingham ZBA issued a special 
permit (attached) to 2 Waverly Street for outdoor seating (16 seats). In accordance with ZBA case # 09‐05, 
under “Findings and Conclusions”, section 7.5, the outdoor seating is only allowed as a portion of the given 
occupant load of 50. In other words, outdoor seats would have to be subtracted from the indoor seats to a 
limit of 16 outdoor seats (leaving an interior occupant load of 34). This makes sense as the occupant load of 
a restaurant is restrained by several factors including toilet count, means of egress, square 
footage/occupant, and parking, at a minimum: “Mr. Varela stated he would like to operate an outdoor 
seating area for 16 seats at his restaurant. Current seating capacity is 50 seats and 16 of those seats would 
be moved outdoors during good weather conditions.” 
2. The current proposal is 41 interior occupants and 40 exterior occupants. They would be increasing the 
restaurants previous total occupant load by 31 occupants. A building permit is required to be obtained to 
increase the occupant load in accordance with 780 CMR 105.1. 
3. Framingham Inspectional Services will not oppose any combination of exterior and interior seating that 
equals 50 total occupants. However, when temporary outdoor seating expires, the owners of 2 Waverly 
Street are required to operate in accordance with the decision issued in 2009, where outdoor seating is 
limited to 16 outdoor occupants and the interior occupant load is lowered to 34, when offering exterior 
seating (16 outdoor seats). 
Thank you

alcohol licenses. He also made his motion conditional upon all city department approvals and
