Reserve

liabilities such as OPEB

Global Strategy
• Realistic revenue estimate
– Careful not to overestimate State Aid
• Fund Level Service budget for all
departments
– In some cases this is a reduction in spending
– There are Departments that are still
operating at FY2009 reduced service levels
• Make strategic investments in core
services that will provide measurable
improvement in six broad areas:

Revenue Estimate
• Weakness:
– Chapter 70 aid increased by $3.3 million has
moderate risk
• House Budget recommends Ch 70 aid of $30.4M
• This is $982,092 less than our revenue estimate
• House Charter School revenue offsets loss by
$176,481
• Net revenue risk is $805,611
– Senate Budget still pending
• Senate Ch 70 aid should be in line with what we
are expecting

Estimated Impact on Taxes
• Increase in average single family tax bill is
$110 (1.9%)
– increase in town wide value of $120.5 million
– Commercial values are increasing at a higher rate
than residential
• Tax burden moves slightly toward commercial sector
• Commercial and multi-unit dwellings increasing more
than single family homes and absorbing more tax
impact
– Estimated tax rates would be $18.00 for
residential and $40.52 for commercial
– Elimination of tax increase would require a $3.4
million budget cut
