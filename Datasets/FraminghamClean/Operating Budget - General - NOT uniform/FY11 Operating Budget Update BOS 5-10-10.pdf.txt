Revenue Assumptions (cont.)
 State aid changed from 2% decrease to 3% 
decrease in Ch 70 aid.
 If we move from maximum tax levy growth it
will mean additional cuts to all departments
 A $25 change to the average single family tax bill
will require a budget cut of $762,840
 A $50 change in the average single family tax bill 
will require a budget cut of $1.5 million
 Neither of these scenarios mean the average
single family tax bill would decrease

 This will impact services- it is the third year in a
row that municipal departments have been cut
