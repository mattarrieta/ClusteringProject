Annual Report
Year Ending December 31, 2010
Framingham's Town Seal: In the year 1900, the Framingham Town Seal was redesigned
for the Town's bicentennial to recognize our community's prominence in education and
transportation. The Framingham State Normal School, a free public school and the first of
its kind in America, is represented by the structure at the top of the design. Governor
Danforth, the founder of Framingham and owner of much of its land, is acknowledged by
the words "Danforth's Farms 1662" on the shield at the center. The wheel on the shield
with spokes drawn as tracks radiating in six different directions represents the steam and
electric railroads and signifies the Town's position asatransportation hub. Surrounding the
words "Town of Framingham Incorporated 1700" is an illustrative border of straw braid,
which honors the prominent role Framingham played in the manufacture of hats and
bonnets in the 1800s.

Town of Framingham  2010 Annual Town Report
Board of Selectmen
Memorial Building, Rm 1211508-5400532-1  selectmen @framinghamma.gov
2010 will be marked as a year with difficult
economic and budgetary issues. The impact
of flattening revenues coupled with cost
increases such as skyrocketing health care
costs resulted in staff reductions and close
monitoring of overall spending, including
capital spending. Health Care is the single
biggest budget buster with costs rising faster
thanrevenues. Health Care costs haveserious
long -range implications as well. In response,
the Board of Selectmen continued to pursue
long -term Health Care reform on several
fronts. Through the Town Manager, we have
been actively negotiating a fair and
competitive 3 -year Health Care contract with
the Public Employee Coalition ( PEC).At this
writing, we are still in negotiations with the
PEC. The Board ofSelectmen also
authorized the creation of a new and more
competitive Health Care plan for new
employees. This plan, while leaving current
employees and retirees unaffected, would
lower the Health Care cost tothe Town. The
PEC has challenged the Town's right to create
such programs in court based on their
interpretation of Section 19, Coalition
Bargaining. Again as of this writing, the
appealisstillpending. Inajointeffortwith
Town Meeting, the Board of Selectmen
sponsored a home rule petition that seeks
legislative permission to allow Framingham to
endCoalition Bargaining. Thisactionwould
place us on par with a majority of
municipalities in the State. Town Meeting
passed this article and a Bill has been filed in
thisupcoming year'sLegislative Session. We
continue to work in close collaboration with
the Massachusetts Municipal Association and
our regional partners to lobby our legislative
delegation for solutions to long term health
care relief. Addressing the Health Care
General Government 
situation in a fair and sustainable way
continues to be a top priority of the Board of
Selectmen and the management team.
The Board's priorities for this year focused on
six areas: economic development,
neighborhood development, long -term capital
infrastructure, energy efficiency,
environmental issues and issues pertaining to
the administration and the budget.
The Board continued to work with the
professional team to develop and implement
an economic development plan targeting the
Village Centers and Tech Park. Design and
construction of the Downtown Traffic and
Streetscape Improvements project is
progressing well with a construction start date
projected for next year. This investment
coupled with the investment plans of the new
owner of the Arcade building, brings new
hope to realizing a revitalized Downtown.
The Town continued our close collaboration
with the Framingham Housing Authority
implementing the Neighborhood Stabilization
Program. Considerable stridesweremadein
acquiring, rehabilitating and reselling vacant
foreclosed properties in designated target
neighborhoods. Thisyeartheprogramhas
purchased, with Federal dollars, five vacant
properties, completed renovations on four,
and sold two more. As with the Economic
Development plan, the Board continued to
work with the professional team to develop
and implement a neighborhood plan around
quality of life issues such as public safety and
code enforcement.
A campaign to promote Framingham' s many
wonderful attributes was launched with a
1
Page 13
Town of Framingham
marketing brochure and website under the
banner ChooseFramingham. com. It
highlights the reasons our Town is a great
place for living, learning, enjoying and
working.
Water and Sewer infrastructure improvements
to Tech Park continue to support Genzyme
and other commercial expansion plans. These
investments will bring important new tax
revenues to our Town. Thanks to the
incredible efforts of many people, the Town's
massive Water and Sewer improvement
projects, as part of the consent decree with
the State, is on schedule. While during the
construction it has been disruptive in the
short -term, the long -term benefits will
outweigh these short -term issues.
A highlight of this past year was the grand
opening of the new Bowditch Field and
Cultural Center. Constructing it on- budget
and on -time was a testament to the
outstanding team effort. Bowditch has
quickly become a source of community pride. 
2010 Annual Town Report
The Selectmen, working with the professional
staff and State funded consultant, are seeking
to become a Green Community. Selectmen
have also worked closely with the Town
Manager, Chief Financial Officer and other
staff to manage our assets by selling off tax
liens to bring much needed revenue.
Last but certainly not least is the three year
lawsuit with South Middlesex Opportunity
Council ( SMOC). This case has been settled
outofcourtthrough a mediator. The Town
now looks forward to developing a working
relationship with SMOC.
The Board would like to recognize the many
individuals who work tirelessly and without
fanfare who make Framingham such a rich,
diverse and exceptionalcommunity. In
closing, the Selectmen would like to thank
those employees, volunteers, residents,
visitors, workers and elected officials who
Take Pride in Framingham."
Respectfully Submitted,
Dennis Giombetti, Chairman
Board of Selectmen
Town Manager
TW Memorial Building, Rm 121 1  508 -532 -5400 1  town.govmanager@framinghamma.
It is my pleasure to present this Report for
calendar year2010. Beadvised thatthis
Report is intended as a brief summary only.
More comprehensive, detailed information on
all Town activities is available elsewhere in
this Annual Town Report.
The year just completed included some
organizational changes. Early in 2010, we
were joined by new Assistant Town Manager
David Williams. David joined our
management team with considerable on -point
experience, having most recently served as the
Assistant Town Manager ofWeston. Among
David's duties /responsibilities are serving as
Chief Procurement Officer. With the
reorganizational approval of Town Meeting at
its spring, 2010 annual meeting, and with the 
concurrence of the Board of Selectmen, I also
appointed David the Director of Human
Resources /Personnel for the Town. Near the
end of 2010, long -time CDBG coordinator
Sam Swisherretired. I was very pleased to
appoint Ted Fields to this position. Ted
brings with him a wealth of CDBG municipal
experience.
Of course, 2010 represented our second
consecutive year of profound national
economic recession, with attendant negative
implications for local governments across
Americaincluding Framingham. Fortunately,
the pro- active "  course corrections" in
operating spending for Town departments
undertaken in 2009 continued to serve us
well during 2010 by reducing the Town -side
General Government  2
Page 14
Town of Framingham
base of spending for local government
services. Division and Department heads
throughout the Town are to be commended
for their collaborative support and
management teamwork in maintaining the
Town's basic local government services with
fewer staff resources during this time of
unprecedented length of national recession.
Diligent efforts to more reasonably and
effectively manage the Town's employee
health insurance package continued.
Framingham is one of only a couple of "Old
Section 19" communities in  the
Commonwealth — dating back to Board of
Selectmen action from 1993. This means that
the Town is legally prohibited from bargaining
health insurance benefits as part of total
employeecompensation. Further, it means
that Town management is  effectively
prohibited from actively managing the Town's
health insurance program. Instead,
fundamental health insurance decisions are
made by a 
Public Employee Committee
PEC) which includes representation and
voting authority based upon the relative size
of employee unions —  the Framingham
Teacher's Association as the largest union
effectively controls final decisions of the PEC,
as a super -majority is required under this law
to affirm proposed health insurance changes.
Recognizing that the Town of Framingham
has the highest municipal health insurance
costs as a percentage of General Fund in the
Commonwealth (  16 +% and moving rapidly
toward 20 %),  Town Meeting acted by an
overwhelming majority at its fall Special Town
Meeting to adopt a proposed Home Rule
Amendment to be taken to the Legislature.
This Home Rule Petition would effectively
eliminate Public Employee Committee
Coalition Bargaining and allow for employee
health insurance to be collectively bargained
with municipal employee unions as part of
their overall compensation. This is the
manner in which the vast majority of
municipalities operate. Such a  change is
critical to reigning in  the Town's
unsustainable health insurance costs which are
beginning to compromise the Town's ability
General Government 
2010 Annual Town Report
to continue basicservices to residents. The
Legislature is now considering this Home
Rule Petition as HB 1847.
Thanks to the wise capital budget support of
Town Meeting, we were able to continue our
critical program of enhanced stewardship for
Town -owned buildings which had
unfortunately suffered from considerably
diminished maintenance support funding for
at leastthe past decade. Thisincluded the
completion of the main entryway steps
reconstruction at the Town's landmark
Memorial Building. We were also able to
initiate the long- awaited handicapped access
ramp construction on the Union Avenue side
of Town Hall, which should be completed in
the spring of 2011. The long -delayed exterior
reconstruction of the (  sadly, dilapidated)
historic Maynard Building on the Town
Centre Commonwas also completed. Work
is underway in 2011 to proceed with a
successor tenant for portions of this
importantTown building. We also began the
important upgrade /reconstruction of the
HVAC system in the Town's fire station
headquarters on Western Avenue. This
building has had system -related problems for
many years, and this corrective action is
critical to the proper operation of this
important station. Wewerefortunate to
receive some limited federal economic
stimulus funds for energy efficiency purposes.
These funds were devoted to a long- needed
window replacement project for the Memorial
Building. This historicallysensitivewindow
replacement began in the fall of 2010 and is
anticipated to be completed in the spring of
2011.
During 2010, we continued to work closely
with officials at Genzyme in a continuation of
the planned expansion of their campus
complexwithin Tech Park. This involves the
creation of a new manufacturing facility as
well as considerably expanded research
capacity for this world -class biotech company.
We are also closely cooperating in the
completion of a facilities plan for Tech Park
which is intended to anticipate the continuing
3

Town of Framingham
expansion of technology firms within that
important area. Critical infrastructure work,
being overseen by the Department of Public
Works, is continuing to completion on the
utilities expansion /improvement project for
Tech Park which was primarily funded with a
State Life Sciences Grant.
Over Columbus Day weekend, it was a great
joy to attend the impressive opening
ceremonies for the new, renovated Bowditch
Field Complex! My compliments to Parks
and Recreation Director Bob Merusi and the
highly talented team of individuals who
worked with Bob in bringing this great vision
to reality! Congratulations to the Board of
Selectmen, the Parks and Recreation
Commission and Town Meeting for their
steadfast support ofthis renovation! This
enhancement to the Town's
recreation/ cultural infrastructure represents
an extraordinary addition to the quality of life
inourcommunity! Alsoregarding qualityof
life matters, at the instruction of the Board of
Selectmen, following the conclusion of the
2010 Summer Concert Series on the Town
Centre Common, we removed the performing
stage from the Common. That stage was
originally intended to be temporary, rather 
2010 Annual Town Report
than permanent —at one time removed after
each concert season. TheBoard has
approved a plan to fabricate a new,
replacement stage which is "modular" and
which will be erected just before the summer
concerts begin each year and will be removed
afterthelastconcert oftheseason. Thisnew
stage will be erected on the Town Centre
Common, on the Vernon Street side —with
the newly reconstructed Maynard Building as
a backdrop.Thank you to the Board of Selectmen for
their leadership and support during 2010. I
strongly commend my colleagues, the division
and department heads comprising
Framingham's excellent administrative team,
for their extraordinary commitment and
collaborative spirit in providing high quality
local government services to our taxpayers
during a continuing time of considerable fiscal
distress. I  thank Town Meeting for your
communication, engagement and budget
support for the many Town services which we
are so privileged to deliver to fellow residents
of the Town of Framingham.
Respectfully Submitted,
Julian M. Suso, Town Manager
Town Clerk
Memorial Building, Rm 105 1  508 -532 -5521 1  townclerk @framinghamma. gov
The Framingham Town Clerk's office is the
largest joint clerk /election operation in
Massachusetts. We are also one of the busiest
Clerk's offices in the state. The presence of a
birthing hospital, numerous nursing homes
and assisted living facilities and a population
of over 66,000 residents contribute to the
substantial work load.
Assistant Town Clerk Lisa Ferguson manages
our daily operations and instructs and
supervises staff. Lisa helped design the newly
renovated vault where all the Town' s vital
General Government 
records are stored. She has organized the
area so that all records are easily accessible.
The Town Clerk Department is responsible
for creating and preserving the Town's vital
records. The two administrators are Emily
Black and Yelena Feldhouse. Their primary
responsibilities are customer service and
processing vital records. In 2010, we
registered and issued 1429 birth certificates,
605 death certificates, 458 marriage licenses,
3485 dog licenses and 571 business
certificates. Other responsibilities include:
processing requests; issuing underground

storage tank permits; collecting fines for the
Board of Health, Conservation Commission,
Police Department, Building and Public
Works Departments and Animal Control;
maintaining all permanent Public Way Access
Permits, Zoning Board of Appeals, Planning
Board, and Historic Commission decisions
and appeals; conducting genealogy searches;
posting meetings and meeting minutes and
issuing raffle permits. Our 2010 revenues
were $236,740.
Lauren DiGiandomenico is the Election
Coordinator. The Election Department is
responsible for: conducting elections and the
Annual Town Census; maintaining the
Town's voter /census data base and its related
street listing; recording town meeting votes,
filing Town Meeting original documents,
preparing the Attorney General Bylaw
submissions and posting the bylaws when
they are approved.
The Annual Town Meeting met over ten
nights in May. Members voted on 36 articles
and approved two resolutions. Three Special
Town Meetings were heldin2010. One
article was voted at the January 26` meeting,
eight articles were voted over two nights at
the May 12` meeting and members voted on
19 articles over five nights at the October 19
meeting.
Weconducted fourelections in2010. On
January 19 there was a 58% turnout for the
Special State Election for US Senator in
Congress. Only 12% voted in the Town
Election on April 12 and 19% in the State
Primary on September 14` The turnout for
the November 2nd State Election was 57 %.
Changes to Campaign Finance laws and the
Open Meeting Law became effective in July
2010. Municipalities with websites are now
required to post financial statements of
candidates with more than $1000 of activity
within a  reporting period on the website.
Meeting postings with agendas must also be
available on the Town website at all times.

2010 Annual Town Report
I am grateful to Town Manager Julian Suso
and his Division Heads, DPW Director Peter
Sellers and Community and Economic
Development Director Alison Steinfeld for
providing staff to assist with the Town's
participation inUSCensus activities. Miekele
Neves, C &ED administrator coordinated
meetings and correspondence. Alexis Silver,
Human Services Coordinator, was
instrumental in working with landlords to
assist in securing an accurate population
count. Geoff Kovar, Geographic Information
Systems specialist is assisting with our
reprecincting efforts.
The Board of Selectmen, Town Officials and
Town Meeting members provide consistent
support to this office; it is a genuine pleasure
to work with them and with all those who
participate in our government. Town
employees are always professional,
knowledgeable and willing to help. We are
grateful to Doug Goddard, Capital Projects
Manager for supervising the renovation of our
vault, Carly Premo Melo and the Technology
Services staff for automating many of our
operations and Jim Egan and the Building
Services staff for facilitating elections. We are
not charged to use Keefe Tech or St. Tarcisius
Parish Center as polling locations; nor are we
charged for the use of St. Stephen's parking
lot on election days. Ourpollworkers
continue to work long days to ensure that the
public is well served when they vote. Through
the Senior Tax Relief Program, we were
fortunate to have the help of Chet Fenno and
Alexandra Ross.
Finally and most importantly I thank and
commend my small, dedicated staff for their
hard work, professionalism and
knowledgeable, friendly attitudes when
dealing with the public. They exemplify the
Town's commitment to excellent customer
service.
Respectfully submitted,
Valerie Mulvey, Town Clerk

Carney v. Town of
Framingham 
Wetlands 
2008 STATUS /DISPOSITION
This case concerns a suit by Boston Properties to recover $175,000
in funds from a failed development near Mass Pike Exit 12. Undera
1999 development covenant executed by Boston Properties, it agreed
to provide $350,000 to the Town provided that certain contingencies
occurred, namely the issuance of certain permits for the
development. The development failed and Boston Properties is now
seeking this money back, claiming the contingencies never occurred.
The dispute centers on whether the contingencies occurred or did
not occur. The Town's position is that the contingencies occurred
based on certain site preparation and demolition that occurred on the
property, as well as the moving of the historic Rugg -Gates House.
Presently the Town is awaiting discovery responses and plans to
depose Boston Properties. The parties will continue with their
discovery efforts through 2011
This action was filed against the Town in 2005 by approximately 100
Framingham patrol officers alleging that the Town failed to
appropriately compute and pay overtime wages as required by the
Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA),29 U.C. S.201 -219. The Town
contends that it complied with the FLSA pursuant to payments made
to the officers under the terms of the parties' collective bargaining
agreement. An important issue in this case is the properwork period
tobeused incalculating required overtime sums. The Town
contends that at all relevant times it had an established 24 -day work
period whereby the officers were entitled to FLSA overtime only for
time worked in excess of 147 hours over a 24 -day work period, in
accordance with a formula set forth under applicable federal
Regulations. The officers have argued that the operative threshold
should be 40 hours within a given week, such that they would be
entitled to overtime pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 each
week. The Town moved for summary judgment on this key issue
early in 2008. On July 2, 2008, the Court issued a written decision
which sided with the Town and found that the Town had effectively
established a 24 -day work period under the FLSA in 1986.
Following the Court's decision, the parties entered a stipulation of
judgment whereby the Town would not be liable to the officers,
subject to the officers' right to appeal the Court's determination that
the Town established a 24 -day work period under 29 U.C. S. 207(k)
tothe United States Court ofAppeals forthe First Circuit. The First
Circuit issued a decision affirming the District Court's ruling on
March 17, 2010.
This matter involves the Conservation Commission's efforts to
enforce wetlands violations committed by William Carney of 32
Parker Road. The Commission found that Mr. Carney had clear cut

numerous trees and dumped brush within wetlands resource area
located on 28 Parker Road, 30 Parker Road, and 32 Parker Road.
The Commission issued an enforcement order on April 2, 2008 and
an amended enforcement order on June 4, 2008. Mr. Carney
appealed the enforcement order(s) to the Superior Court under the
certiorari statute, G.L. c. 249, 4. The Superior Court entered
judgment in the Town's favor as to all claims, and the plaintiff has
appealed this judgment to the Massachusetts Appeals Court. The
Town will be preparing and filing an appellee brief during the winter
of 2011, and expects that the Court will schedule an oral argument
on the parties' briefs in the spring of 2011.
This case matter involves a challenge by CSE, the current developer
of the Danforth PUD (successor to Pulte Homes and before Pulte,
National Development of New England),of the Conservation
Commission's January 6, 2010 vote to issue an order of conditions
denying CSE's application for a notice of intent for an order of
conditions to perform certain work in the wetlands area in
connection with its proposed development project located at
Riverpath Drive. In its denial order, the Commission found that
CSE had failed to file minimum fundamental information and
materials necessary to enable the Commission to approve an order of
conditions. CSE filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings under
Superior Court Standing Order 1-96, which governs certiorari cases
under G.L. c. 249, 4, such as this one. The Town filed an
opposition to CSE's motion. The Court has scheduled a hearing in
this matter for September 22, 2011.
This case arises from a request from Fafard Real Estate and
Development Corporation, the developer of the Belport Farms
Subdivision, that the Town accepts DiTullio Drive as a public way,
along with related infrastructure ( including a sewer pump station that
services the subdivision) and release a bond in the amount of
25,000. The Town contends, among other things, that it has no
obligation to take control of and accept responsibility for operation
and maintenance of infrastructure constructed by a private developer
in connection with the 1993 subdivision approval decision by the
Planning Board and, further, that Fafard would not be entitled to
such an outcome in any event insofar as it has failed to satisfy
prerequisites to such acceptance.
Fafard commenced an action against the Town in the Land Court in
June, 2010. Following Fafard's filing of three separate amendments
to its complaint, the Town filed a motion to transfer the case to
Superior Court or, in the alternative, to dismiss Fafard's third
amended complaint based on passage of the statute of limitations.
We also were required to file a motion for preliminary injunction
based on Fafard's threat to stop paying the utility bills for the
pumping station, thus risking substantial environmental impacts and

property damages from sanitary sewage overflows if this were to
occur. The Land Court has scheduled hearings on the motion for
preliminary injunction and motion to dismiss for May, 2011.
The parties recently participated in mediation before Judge Rudolph
Kass oftheREBA Dispute Resolution Center. Ifthecaseisnot
resolved through mediation, we anticipate that this litigation will
require discovery and motion practice in 2011.
This matter involves a petition filed in August, 2010 by the
Framingham Firefighters' bargaining unit, Local 1652, to have the
Joint Labor and Management Committee exercise jurisdiction over
the parties' negotiation for a new collective bargaining agreement.
The JLMC is a state body that intervenes in labor negotiations
between municipalities and police and fire labor organizations to
attempt to resolve bargaining impasses through means such as
arbitration ormediation. Local 1652asserts thattheparties have
reached an impasse in negotiations with regard to wages, clothing,
step raises, and placing stipend funds into the firefighters' base
salaries. The Town agreed to submit to theJLMC's jurisdiction in
this matter. Local 1652 and the Town recently participated inone
unsuccessful mediation session before Brian Harrington and the
JLMC voted to exercise jurisdiction for formal fact finding and
arbitration.
This matter involves a petition filed in August, 2010 by the
Framingham Police Officers union to ask the Joint Labor and
Management Committee exercise jurisdiction over the parties'
negotiation foranewcollective bargaining agreement. Three
mediation sessions before JLMC Mediator Brian Harrington did not
yield a settlement and the parties will proceed to formal fact finding
arbitration before the JLMC.
The Framingham Police Officers Union (FPOU) filed this unfair
labor practice charge with the Massachusetts Labor Relations
Commission, now the Division of Labor Resources (DLR),
following the Town's issuance of correspondence to the FPOU in
April of 2007 reaffirming the existence of the Town's 24 -day work
period pursuant to 29 USC 207(k) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
The FPOU's charge alleged that the Town's correspondence
regarding the existence of the 24 -day work period effected a change
in working conditions that required bargaining. Following the United
States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit's order affirming
summary judgment in the Town's favor in Calvao, et al. v. Town of
Framingham the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts entered a Consent Judgment confirming the validity
of the Town's 24 -day work period for Framingham patrol officers
under 29 U.C. S. 207(k).Notwithstanding the Consent Judgment
and the First Circuit decision that legally affirmed the 24 -day work
period at issue in this case, the Commonwealth Employment

Relations Board (CERB) issued a Complaint of Prohibited Practice
alleging that the Town improperly failed to bargain under state law in
connection with the Town's implementation of its 24 -day work
period.
The CERB issued an amended complaint following the First
Circuit's ruling. Thereafter the Town moved foran order from the
District Court seeking to enforce the terms of the Consent Judgment
establishing a 24 -day work period under the FLSA. The District
Court issued a decision on December 23, 2010 denying the Town's
motion.
To protect its 24 -day work period and avoid potential major adverse
impact to pay further FLSA overtime to the patrolmen based on an
ordinary 40 hour work week, the Town will oppose the Complaint
before CERB in 2011, including defending the Town's position at an
administrative trial that has yet to be scheduled.
In 2007 Patrolman Eduardo Rivera filed a demand for arbitration
appealing a disciplinary suspension. The Town filed an action in
Middlesex Superior Court to enjoin the arbitration on the grounds
that the CBA expressly provides that the proper forum to appeal
disciplinary decisions is the Civil Service Commission rather than
arbitration. After the Superior Court granted the Town's motion for
a preliminary injunction to enjoin the arbitration, the FPOU filed a
motion for summary judgment on August 18, 2009. The Town
opposed this motion and accompanied its opposition with its own
cross - motion for summary judgment. On February 5, 2010, the
Superior Court issued an order denying the FPOU's motion for
summary judgment and allowing the Town's cross -motion. The
FPOU has appealed the Superior Court's order to the Massachusetts
Appeals Court. Briefs will be filed shortly and we expect to receive a
decision sometime in calendar year 2011.
The Framingham Police Officers Union filed this complaint of
prohibited management practice charge on June 26, 2009, alleging
that the Town committed an unfair management practice by
allegedly requiring certain patrol officers to be interviewed without
representation in connection with an internal affairs investigation
concerning adifferent officer. The parties entered asettlement
agreement in December of2010 that fully resolved this matter. This
matter is now closed.
This matter concerns the appeal of an arbitration decision issued in
favor of the PEC over the Town's plan to implement different health
insurance plans for new employees after January 1, 2010. The
arbitration occurred in April and May 2010 and a decision in favor of
the PEC was issued in August 2010. The Superior Court recently
denied the Town's motion to vacate the arbitration award and
allowed thePEC'smotion toconfirm thearbitration award. The

Board of Selectmen recently authorized an appeal of the Superior
Court decision, which the Town has filed.
This matter concerns a grievance on behalf of Police Officer
Gregory Reardon over the transmission of a department -wide email.
An arbitration was held in November, 2010, after which the
arbitrator issued a decision resolving this matter. This matter is now
closed.
Hess Corporation filed an appeal in February of 2009 of a decision
by the Zoning Board of Appeals denying it a special permit
modification for its gas station located at 272 Hollis Street. The
Land Court held a trial in this matter on June 23, 2010. Following
trial the parties filed post -trial briefs. (This is the second trial held in
Hess Corporation's ongoing efforts to obtain permitting for 272
Hollis Street. The ZBA's denial ofa special permit for this location
was upheld at a trial held in 2006.) The Land Court recently issued a
decision upholding the Zoning Board of Appeals decision to deny a
special permit for the addition of a convenience store to the gas
station
This matter arises out of the Conservation Commission's attempt to
enforce wetlands violations at property owned by plaintiffs Roger
and Dawn Levasseur at 49 Gates Street (the "Property "). The
plaintiffs purchased the Property on or about December 12, 2008
from Leonidas and Elaine Exarchos. After conducting a review, the
Commission concluded that the Property contains wetlands areas
that have been disturbed, including by grass and fencing that was
installed inconnection withbackyard expansion activities. The
Levasseurs have alleged that the violations were committed by the
Exharchosesorotherpriorowner(s) oftheproperty. The
Commission first voted to issue an enforcement order on December
17, 2008, and issued a subsequent enforcement order (the
Enforcement Order ")  on January 7, 2009. The Levasseurs appealed
the Enforcement Order to the Superior Court under the certiorari
statute, G.L. c. 249, 4. Thereafter, on June 8, 2010, the plaintiffs
added a number of defendants to lawsuit, including the Exarchoses,
and two attorneys involved in the closing. In their answer, the
Exarchoses included a cross -claim against the Town and the
Framingham Conservation Commission for Misrepresentation,
Negligent Misrepresentation, Negligence, Fraud and Malicious
Prosecution /Abuse of Process. The Cross -claim seeks monetary
damages against the Town and the Commission in the amount of
over $1,000, 100, along with attorney's fees.
The plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings and the
Court held a hearing on the motion on January 11, 2011. On March
7, 2011, the Court issued an order denying the plaintiffs' motion for
judgment on the pleadings and affirming the Enforcement Order

issued by the Commission. The parties have not yet commenced
discovery practice with regard to the Exarchoses counterclaim and
cross -claim.
This matter arose in May of 2010 when Police Chief Steven Carl
decided to "bypass" the Appellant, Michael Loughman, for a vacant
police lieutenant position and instead promote Robert Downing.
Mr. Loughman filed a bypass appeal with the Civil Service
Commission on June 7, 2010 seeking to challenge the Bypas
Decision. Subsequently Mr. Loughman filed a complaint with the
Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination alleging that his
bypass resulted from age discrimination. The parties entered a
settlement agreement in December of 2010 fully resolving all claims
in this matter. This matter is now closed.
This is the first of the Paulini lawsuits, and it is has been stayed by
the court pending the outcome of the third lawsuit, which will be
described below. In December of 2005, the Zoning Board of
Appeals denied Paulini Loam's application for a special permit to
construct aconcrete hatching plantattheProperty. Atthetime of
the initial application, the property was zoned General
Manufacturing. Paulini claimed that the concrete hatching plant was
allowed under Section IILG.La of the Zoning Bylaw, which allows
manufacturing of any description utilizing processes free from
neighborhood disturbing odors and /or other agencies" in the
General Manufacturing district. The Building Commissioner had
ruled that the proposed use required a special permit under Section
III.2G.as a use "which would be offensive because of injurious or
obnoxious noise, vibration, smoke, gas, fumes, odors, dust or other
objectionable features...." Paulini filed this appeal seeking to
overturn the ZBA's denial of the special permit, and to obtain a
declaration from the Court that the proposed plant did not require a
special permit. There has been extensive discovery, including
depositions, in this case, but as noted above it has been stayed by the
Court for some time.
This case has also been stayed by the Land Court. In December of
2005, a Special Town Meeting approved two amendments to the
Zoning By -law, one of which changed the zoning designation of the
area to Office Professional, such that the proposed use became
prohibited and could not be authorized even through a special
permit. The second amendment changed the procedures and
thresholds for site plan review. Paulini filed this second lawsuit, this
time naming the town as defendant, challenging the validity of the
Zoning By -law amendments. In the meantime, Paulini had filed a
definitive subdivision plan for the Property, which was approved by
the Planning Board, thereby "freezing" the zoning of the Property
for 8 years from the date the subdivision plan was approved. As a
result, the Property is still governed by the General Manufacturing
zoning as itexisted in 2005. We filed amotion for summa

judgment on behalf of the Town in this case, arguing that the two
amendments are valid as a matter of law. That motion is still pending
at the Land Court
This case represents the most recent appeal filed by Paulini Loam,
LLC, appealing the Board's decision to uphold the Building
Commissioner' s denial of a building permit for the proposed
concrete manufacturing plant. Paulini's complaint includes two
counts: the first is an appeal under G.L. c. 40A 17 of the Board's
decision, and the second is a request for a declaratory judgment that
the proposed use of the site for a concrete manufacturing facility is
allowed by right under the Zoning Bylaw. The Board filed a motion
for summary judgment on the grounds that it is not disputed that the
plans submitted to the Building Commissioner showed a structure,
within the meaning of the Zoning Bylaw, within a required setback.
Since this is a violation of the Zoning Bylaw, and would require a
variance from the Board of Appeals, the Town contends that this
reason alone is sufficient to uphold the Board's decision, without the
need for the court to review whether the denial of the building
permit was also justified because the proposed use requires a special
permit. Paulini also requested a declaratory judgment from the court
under G.L. c. 240 14A that the proposed use was a use allowed by
right and did not require a special permit from the Board of
Appeals. The Town argues in response that this count ofthe
complaint should be dismissed because it is simply a duplication of
the chapter 40A section 17 appeal and, in any event, Paulini already
has a request for a declaratory judgment in its earlier appeal, and
therefore this countwas barred by that prior pending action. The
court held a hearing on the Board's motion for summary judgment
on June 1, 2010. The court took the matter under advisement and
has not yet issued a decision.
This is an action against the Town seeking recovery of
allegedly uncompensated work for loaming and seeding
which the plaintiff, Revoli Construction Co.,purports to have
completed in connection with the Town's construction of the
Doeskin Water Betterment Project (the "Project "). The
parties recently reached a resolution of this case and this
matter is concluded.
This matter involves a certiorari appeal under G.L. c. 249, 4 by the
plaintiff, Gerard Spagnuolo, of the Conservation Commission's
issuance of an enforcement order on or about December 2, 2009, as
amended by the Commission pursuant to a vote conducted on
January 6, 2010. The Commission found that the plaintiffhad
conducted various unpermitted activities on property located at 545
Edgell Road within a wetlands resource area and /or buffer zone in
violation of the Wetlands Protection Bylaw and the Wetlands
Protection Act. The unpermitted activities that the Commission
found to have been undertaken include, among other things,

significant cutting, filling, and grading above and within a steep
embankment (resulting in a deposit of boulders and debris in the
wetlands),stockpiling of fill and sediment surrounding several
mature trees, and failure to install erosion controls.
After the plaintiff filed this case in the Land Court, the Commission
removed this case to the United States District Court for the District
of Massachusetts because the plaintiffs Complaint and Amended
Complaint recited a series of alleged violations of the federal and
state constitution. On February 8, 2011, the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts issued an order finding that
there were no federal claims in this matter and remanding the case to
theLand Court. The parties nowwill proceed to engage in motion
for judgment on the pleadings practice under Land Court Standing
Order 1 -04.
This was a consolidated action involving: 1) an action appealing a
vote of the Board of Selectmen taken on October 21, 2008 to
remove certain public shade trees located adjacent to 13 Bradford
Road; and 2) an action against the Town alleging that the Town's
removal ofthe underlying trees constituted anunlawful taking. The
parties reached a settlement of this matter in December of 2010,
thereby terminating both actions in full resolution of this matter.
This matter is now closed.
This case involves an appeal by T- Mobile of the ZBA's July 13, 2010
decision denying T- Mobiles application for use and dimensional
variances and a special permit in connection with T- Mobile's planned
construction and installation, operation and maintenance of a
proposed wireless communications facility on property leased by T-
Mobile located at 300 Pleasant Street (the Decision).T- Mobile
alleges that the Decision was not supported by substantial evidence
and constituted an effective prohibition of wireless communications
servicesinviolationof 704 of the Federal Telecommunications Act
of 1996, 47 U.C. S. 332(c) ( " TCA "). Specifically, T- Mobile alleges,
among other things, that the ZBA ignored expert testimony and
evidence concerning T- Mobile's alleged significant gap in its
coverage network within the Town, ignored uncontroverted
testimony and evidence concerning the purported lack of feasible
alternatives available to T- Mobile to rectify its significant gap in
network coverage and failed to consider whether the need to close a
significant gap in coverage was necessary to avoid an effective
prohibition ofpersonalwireless services. The ZBA and the Town
disputes T- Mobile's position. Through 2011 theparties will engage
in discovery practice (including discovery requests, responses and
depositions of expert witnesses) and the potential filing of dispositive
motions.

in this matter. Position statements have been filed by the parties and
we are awaiting a decision from the MCAD as to whether a Finding
of Probable Cause will issue.
The plaintiffs are not -for -profit organizations that provide housing
and other social services to individuals. In recent years the plaintiffs
have proposed and obtained the sitting of several programs, facilities
and housing throughout the Town. The plaintiffs have sued the
Town and several Town officials and employees in their official and
individual capacities, along with other individuals, alleging a series of
violations of federal and state laws in connection with an alleged
coordinated effort by the defendants to wrongfully exclude the
plaintiffs and their clients from sitting new programs and facilities in
Town. In early 2008, SMOC also filed a lawsuit in Middlesex
Superior Court alleging that the Town failed to produce public
records pursuant to G.L. c. 66, 10. The parties settled both cases
in October of 2010 without admission of liability, thereby officially
terminating alllawsuits. Both matters are now closed.

Tang v. 
Town of
Framingham 
Constitutional
Law 
2010 Annual Town Report
This is an action against the Town by a state prison inmate alleging,
among other things, unlawful arrest, conspiracy and assault and
battery. The Federal District Court ofMassachusetts dismissed the
case with prejudice in September, 2008. The Court's Memorandum
and Order of dismissal noted that Mr. Tang filed twenty -six cases
with the Federal District Court over the past year, 15 of which had
already been dismissed as frivolous or for failure to pay the filing fee,
among other things. The plaintiffappealed the dismissal to the
United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in October,
2008, and then again in January, 2009. The First Circuit issued
rulings in March, 2009 affirming the District Court rulings and
dismissing Mr. Tang's appeals. The Court followed with an Order
on April 23, 2009 directing the Clerk of Court not to accept any
further filings by Mr. Tang in this case. Mr. Tang subsequently filed
two other lawsuits against the Town in Middlesex Superior Court
and these two actions remain pending.
III. Budgetary Overview
As in past years, I would like to conclude this
report with a brief discussion of budgeting
and legal expenses. In 2010, this office
continued its positive track record of
procuring new revenue for the General Fund
or helping to avoid the imposition of
additional costs to theTown. The services
provided by the Office of the Town Counsel
have resulted in monetary benefits to the 
Town that has resulted in direct revenue,
mitigation and avoided expenses three to four
times greater than the Town's FY 2010
appropriation of $623,000.
Below is a chart summarizing the revenue,
mitigation and avoided expenses achieved in
FY 2010 by the efforts of the Office of Town
Counsel working with other departments,
boards or commissions, or through the
substantial assistance of this office.
A. FY 2010 Revenue, Mitigation and Avoided Expenses

Payments Received
from Ashland for
sewage transport and

Revenue) 
Descri tion:
Payments received in FY2010 for sewage transport under the
February 13, 2004 Decision issued by the Department of
Telecommunications and Energy, and pursuant to the January 1,
2007 IMA between Ashland and Framingham. This represents a
more than 200 -fold increase over what Framingham received
from 1964 -2003 under the 1963 Intermunicipal Agreement with
Ashland ($5500 per year).
Pelham Apartments
and Framingham
Housing Authority
Trash Collection
300,000 
By virtue of a prior year's favorable summary judgment ruling achieved
in the Pelham litigation, the Town was able to cease trash collection at
the 550 units at the Pelham Apartments, which results in avoided
expenses estimated at more than $100,000 per year. By virtue of the
Pelham ruling, the Town also was able to cease trash collection at

Avoided Expense)
TOTAL FY 2010 
2010 Annual Town Report
approximately 1,000 units owned by the Framingham Housing
Authority, thus realizing savings of approximately an additional
estimated $200,000 per year. These savings amount to approximately
300,000 per year on an annual recurring basis.
As a result of the United States Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit's decision affirming the District Court's decision allowing
the Town's Motion for Summary Judgment with respect to the
Town's establishment of a 24 -day work period under 29 U.C.S.
207(k),the Town has avoided liability to date for approximately
1,000500,in damages, in view of the federal law that often
allows for double damages and attorney's fees to be assessed
against parties found to have violated the Fair Labor Standards
Act. Additionally, the Town has to date avoided the need to pay
FLSA overtime to officers who work more than 40 hours per
week (CBA overtime is paid),thus saving the Town
approximately $150,000 per year on an annual basis.
1$  2,968.726,91
While we 
certainly cannot promise the
revenue, mitigation and avoided expenses
achieved in FY 2010 on an ongoing basis in
the future, we 
will continue to exercise
creativity, diligence, and apply the highest
legal skills to address the litigation that does
arise as we advocate on behalf of the best
interests of the Board of Selectmen and the
taxpayers of the Town of Framingham. 
CONCLUSION
In closing, we wish to thank the Board of
Selectmen and the residents of the Town for
the opportunity to serve as your Town
Counsel.

A 5 9's (99.999 %) reliability performance goal
was met for all 38 buildings on the fiber

the existing, out -dated equipment and now
provides a 10x higher speed connection.
Network Services continued with the
virtualization effort to consolidate dedicated
servers into virtual servers that utilize disk,

Building Services is a department of the
General Government Division. Our primary
function is the care and maintenance of Town
buildings under the jurisdiction of the Town
Manager. 
I would like to acknowledge at this time my
heartfelt thanks to my assistant Walter Premo
who will be retiring this June and congratulate
him on 29 years of exemplary service to the
Town of Framingham.
Over the past few years budget cuts have
reduced our staff to a point of looking at
alternate ways of conducting our business.
This has resulted in the custodial privatization
of cleaning services at the Callahan Senior
Center for a 
trial period. The success of this
program may lead to more efficient use of
town funds in many departments.
The Memorial Building Capital Project
Window Replacement Program under the
authority of our Capital Program Manager,
Doug Goddard is  ongoing and will be
completed by this summer. This window
replacement has been a long time coming and
we applaud Doug for his aggressive approach
and spear -heading this project to completion.
In addition to our core responsibilities
Building Services operates all parking
functions, Parking Meter Program, Waverly
Commuter Lot, Pearl Street Garage and the
Hollis Court Lot. 
Walter's dedication to the department over
the years has been evident as he and our staff
has stepped up to fill the voids left by staff
cuts.
As this will also be my last Town Meeting as
an employee, I would like to personally thank
Town Meeting for the many, many years of
support of capital projects and department
funding. I wish you allwell.
Town administration will be reviewing
Building Services in the coming months to
streamline services for efficiency to deliver
services that will be consistent and at an
acceptable level.
I would like to thank the many departments
of the Town for their assistance over the years
by providing services, staff and a commitment

December 1, 2010, marked my second year of
service as 
the Capital Building Projects
Manager for the Town of Framingham.
During the past year, I  have been able to
access and review the existing conditions of
many of the Town Owned properties, and
determine where the financial and technical
challenges exist, moving forward.
Many Town Owned Buildings are in need of
help in the form of renovations or
reconstruction in various degrees.
As the Capital Building Projects Manager, my
duties include working with the Town
Manager to envision and expedite strategic
building projects. In the past year, I  have
managing financial, technical, and historical
aspects of building projects that have a value
of over $20,00000. in Framingham. Included
are many projects in multiple buildings, of
widelyvarying ages 
and complexities. The
projects this year include: Memorial Building,
Maynard Building, McAuliffe Branch Library,
Fire Department Headquarters, Fire Stations,
and the Main Library, as well as the Village
Hall.
The position of Capital Building Projects
Manager, has allowed me to be an energy
advocate on behalf of Framingham to
decrease the energy consumption of town
owned buildings. Thisservestwopurposes;
Saving the Framingham tax payer's money,
and reducing the "  carbon footprint" of

attention of state officials and afforded the
Town of Framingham the opportunity to take 
advantage of federal stimulus funding. This
will both create good jobs in Framingham and
will bolster our economic stability.
As the Capital Building Projects Manager
during 2010, my position has included
working with the Framingham Disability
Commission. Ihavemetwiththedisabled

The desire of the disabled community
to access all public buildings, including
historic ones with a sense of dignity.
We have constructed a ramp at the
Memorial Building, and also a
sloped walkway at the Village Hall.
The desire of the historical
preservationists to maintain the
original characteristics, qualities and
historic fabric of the historic

Chief Financial Officer
Memorial Building, Rm 127 1508-5425532-1  office.cfo@framinghamma. gov
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer
has both financial and policy duties. Itis
staffed by the Chief Financial Officer and
anAssistant ChiefFinancial Officer. The
Office administers Town finances with
the assistance of three departments that
have direct responsibility for financial
management of Town government: the
Assessing Department is responsible for
the administration of the property tax
system including the valuation of real and
personal property and the assessment of
taxes against these parcels and accounts.
The Office of the Treasurer/ Collector is
responsible for the collection of all town
revenues, the investment of all revenues,
and the management of the Town's debt.
The Accounting Department maintains
the Town's accounting records, generates
financial management information for use
by all Town departments in the
management of their operations, directs
all audit activity and reviews compliance
with internal controls.
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer
is directly responsible for the development
of the annual operating and capital
budgets. The CFO works closely with all
Town officials to develop these budgets.
Upon adoption of the annual operating
and capital budgets, the Office of the
Chief Financial Officer monitors revenue
and spending throughout theyear. The
CFO is also required to file a long term
forecast for strategic planning of the
Towns financial position.
Other responsibilities of the Chief
Financial Officer include participation in
management ofworkers' compensation
Finance 
claims; management of the health
insurance plan and membership on the
Retirement Board.
Calendar year 2010 which covers the
second half of Fiscal year 2010 and the
first half of Fiscal year 2011, has been a
financial challenge. Expenditure growth
still exceeds revenue growth due both to
economic and legal effects. The Town
must still live within its means, so budgets
are reduced, services are reduced or
limited and positions are cut. The Town
received the benefit of a bond rating
upgrade to Aa2 when Moody's rating
agency re- tooled municipal bond ratings.
The adoption of the increase in local
room tax of 2% and a new local meals tax
of .25% allowed the Town to add $1.4
million to the Stabilization fund in FYI 1.
If this plan is followed through FY14, the
Town will have funded the Stabilization
Fund to its policy level of 5% of the total
budget. The FYI I Capital Budget
continued necessary investment in Town
assets while minimizing impact on
operating revenues. Continued
responsible financial management is
critical to the forward progress of the
Town.
In 2010, the Finance Division assumed
the additional duty of processing the
School Department payroll; specifically
under the supervision of the Town
Accountant. The consolidation ofthis
function is intended to provide greater
adherence to laws, regulations and rules of
accounting and finance as well as
enhanced efficiency in processing.

Howarth, Jr. and his staff in the
Accounting Department, Stephen Price
and his staff in the Office of the
Treasurer/ Collector; Dan Dargon and his
staff in the Assessing Office. This 
2010
Division has absorbed more responsibility
without adequate resources, yet still
provides the clarity and transparency of
information to Town residents and
excelling in their fiduciary duties.
Respectfully Submitted,
Mary Ellen Kelley, CFO
Town Accountant
VW Memorial Building, Rm 205 1508-5410532-1  town .accountant @framinghamma.gov
The Office of the Town Accountant is
responsible for insuring that all
expenditures of the Town conform to the
requirements of Massachusetts General
Laws, Town Meeting appropriations and
grantors, and do not exceed Town
Meeting appropriations or  grant
authorizations. The Office also accounts
for all financial transactions of the Town -
receipts and expenditures —  in
conformance with generally accepted
accounting principles and the Uniform
Municipal Accounting System
promulgated by the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts' Department ofRevenue.
It then makes this accounting information
available to ( 1) the Town's municipal
program managers to facilitate their
management of program budgets, ( 2)
independent auditors who must opine on
the financial condition of the Town; (3)
state and federal agencies for use in
generating financial information for
program and policy development, and, (4)
credit rating agencies for their use in
assessing the Town's fiscal stability and
creditworthiness and Residents.
Significant activities of the Accounting
Office include the submission of required
financial reports, reconciliation of revenue
and expenditure accounts, cash, and
accounts receivable as well as auditing all
accounts payable invoices for accuracy
prior to payment. 
At the October 27, 2009 the Town's
payroll function was transferred from
Human Resources Director to the Chief
Financial Officer and subsequently to the
TownAccountant' sOffice. Starting in
July of 2010, the School' s Payroll
department was also placed under the
direction of the Chief Financial Officer.
The June 30, 2010 (FYI 0) balance sheet
was submitted to the DOR on October 7
2010, for certification of available funds.
On November 4, 2010 the DOR certified
the following amounts as available for
appropriation: General Fund Free Cash:
2,490070,Sewer Enterprise Fund
Retained Earnings: $2,446, 078,Water
Enterprise Fund Retained Earnings
3,209. 234,These available funds
represent unrestricted surpluses that are
available for appropriation by Town
Meeting. They aregenerated from
positive operating results in relation to the
budget; that is, they are derived from
annual receipts in excess of budget
estimates and expenditures less than the
appropriations authorized by Town
Meeting.
For Fiscal Year 2010, the Department
processed over 15,000 purchase orders,
reviewed over 44,000 invoices and issued
over 19,500 accounts payable checks.

Annual Report 
Town of Framingham  2010
Aft TreasurerITax Collector
IMMENIN—
Memorial Building, Rm 109 1508-5430532-1  treasurer @framinghamma.gov
Fiscal Year 2010 was a good year in this
busy office ofeight. The
Treasurer/ Collector's office continues to
provide customer service and essential
municipal services. As always, I am
indebted to my staff for the first -class job
they do on my behalf as well as the Town
of Framingham.
Collection amounts and percentages were
as follows: Real estate taxes collected were
141,692.249,48 (98.45 %),and Personal
Property taxes were $8,714.961,63
98.60 %). Excise Taxes collected were
4,832.865,18 (77.02 %). Excise tax is
collected on a calendar -year basis, which is
reflected in the lower collection
percentage. TaxTitle collections were
2,493.682,64 including interest and
penalties. Wehavecontinued towork
hard on delinquent taxes in every area and
recently foreclosed on a property and will
schedule an auction soon.
Earning on general fund investments for
the year totaling $375,87063.were slightly
above budget. We continue to monitor
the bank rates to maximize our earnings.
The Town's Bond Rating increased from
Al to Aa2 with a Challenging Outlook in
FY 11 from Moody's. The future will
hold a challenge to maintain it but the
goal is to work to that end. We need to
improve our fund balances to help offset
those areas that we have little control,
such asper capitaincome levels. We
issued three Bond Anticipation Notes in
2010, awarded to Eastern bank in the
amount of $40,773944,with a premium of
444,23660. and net interest cost of
411%. $ 2,000, 545,with a premium of
8,67, 168. net interest cost of .529 %,  and
385,000 with a coupon rate of 1.25. 
Additionally, we borrowed $13,000041,in
general obligation bonds for multiple
projects awarded to Fidelity Capital
Markets, at a rate of 3.18% among the
several bidders. Thebidincluded a
premium of $503,65. 361. This was the
most competitive rate in the face of stable
Federal Fund rates. Additionally, the
Town issued interim loans totaling
50,880207, through the Massachusetts
Water Pollution Abatement Trust at net
interest cost of .26% for various sewer
improvements projects.
This department has worked diligently to
meet the requirements of the laws, the
challenges of the technology advances,
and the Town's customer service policy.
We treat taxpayers with respect while
accepting their payments, answering their
questions regarding process, and solving
their problems as quickly and efficiently as
possible. Per Town By -Law, I am
reporting the following information
regarding authorized debt schedules. The
first schedule shows what is authorized
and un- issued as of June 30, 2010. The
second schedule shows the debt issued
and outstanding during Fiscal Year 2010.
Respectfully submitted,
Stephen W. Price, Treasurer/ Collector

Board of Assessors
Memorial Building, Rm 1011508-5415532-1  assessing @framinghamma. gov
The Board of Assessors' annual report for
calendar year 2010 with statistics for Fiscal
Year 2010 is as follows:
Because of the values established in Fiscal
Year 2010, we received 527 abatement
applications. These applications
represented 2.57% of the total tax bills
issued for Fiscal Year 2010.
In Fiscal Year 2011 the residential class
contributed $23.6 million dollars in new 
value. This growth was attributed to new
homes completed in 2010 as well as other
improvements made to the residential
inventory during 2010. Commercial,
Industrial and Personal Property growth
added $38.3.
Values were lowered for Fiscal Year 2011
due to declining values indicated by sales
and market data analyzed. The average
value for a single -family home was
324,214 from $342,887 or 5.4 %.

Emergency Management
Framingham Emergency Management
Agency (FrEMA) directs all emergency
management operations in the Town of
Framingham. Emergency management is
the preparedness, mitigation, response and
recovery of both naturally occurring
events like blizzards, ice storms,
hurricanes, flooding or earthquakes as well
as any man made disasters such as
chemical spills, fires, transportation events
andactsofterrorism. Framingham
Emergency Management has worked
extensively under its current structure to
create planning groups, exercise response
activities, secure funding from grants and
state and federal sources and expand
participation in this municipal function.
In September 2010 FrEMA in concert
with Framingham department of public 
2010
works and the Northeast Homeland
Security Regional Advisory Council
opened up an emergency equipment cache
located at Framingham DPW. This cache
is one of only three in the State and will
be used to disperse equipment and
suppliesduringemergencies. FrEMA, in
conjunction with state and federal
authorities, prepares, administers and
implements Framingham's CEMP
Comprehensive Emergency Management
Plan) as well as the federal mandated
NIMCAST. In 2007 the entire CEMP was
rewritten and printed; this is the first time
since 1997. The FrEMA also implemented
amass notification system in 2007. This
system (Connect CTY) allows public
safety officials to notify residents and
businesses in Framingham in a matter of
minutes, and enables us to give pertinent
information and instruction. In 2010 the
system made 39 calls contacting 408,515
residencesandbusinesses. A survey was
conducted with the system in December
of 2007 and 95.4 %of respondents stated
they felt safer with the system in place.
In 2010 Framingham also joined five
other communities ( Ashland, Natick,
Holliston, Hopkinton and Sherborn) to
form the MetroWest Regional Emergency
Planning Committee. Framinghamwill
continue to be a leader in the ever
increasing role of emergency management
in a post 911 era, roles and responsibilities
are increasing and the Town will need to
recognize the value of emergency
preparedness.
Crime Statistics
The department is committed to using its
resources efficiently andeffectively. The
use of crime and statistical analysis enables
us to identify emerging crime trends, track
incident locations and identify and
implement preventative, educational,
intervention, or enforcement strategies.

Annual Report
Highlights in Review:
April 10, 2010 was a cool spring morning
which would soon turn into a most
horrific day for the departments we nearly
lost four firefighters in a roll -over accident
that was the result of a catastrophic
mechanical failure of the Fire Engine.
Miraculously, the firefighters involved in
this accident were able to survive with
non -life threatening injuries.
A New Release Truck was placed in
service inJuly of2010. This specialized
rescue vehicle was designed by the
members of the department and meets the
specificneedsofthecommunity. Itisthe
first new rescue truck purchased by the
department in 19 years.
Also in July, a new Deputy Chiefs vehicle
was placed in service. This vehicle
replaced a five year old vehicle which had
over 100,000 miles on it.
In August, a new Engine was placed in
service replacing the engine that was
destroyed in the April accident. In order
to expedite the replacement process, we
utilized a new purchasing program of
which Framingham was the first
community to take delivery of fire
apparatus using the new collaborative
purchasing program established between
the Fire Chiefs Association of
Massachusetts and the Metropolitan Area
Planning Council.
In September, Probationary Firefighters
Michael Nianchi, Jose Rubio and William
Petro Jr. graduated from the Training
Academy.
We enhanced our communications
capabilities with a communications
upgrade which included new dispatch
computers for all front line apparatus, fire
prevention and command staff. 
2010
We were successful in obtaining some
outside funding through grant awards
from the Executive Office of Public
Safety and Massachusetts Department of
Fire Safety and will continue to seek
additional outside revenue sources and
grants. Some ofthese grants arelisted
below. 
SAFE - Student Awareness of Fire
Educations: $6,300 public safety
education
EOPS Staffing Grant: $89,000;
paid the salaries of two firefighters for one
year. 
MDU- Mobile Decontamination
Unit: $3,000 training and maintenance of
State De -Con Unit
The department is fortunate to have
firefighters who serve in the Armed
Services and the Town and Department
provide assistance and support to their
families when they are deployed for active
combat duty. Many thanks go to those
who have served on our behalf.
The operation of the Fire Department is
large and complex. We do more than
simply respond to fires, rescues and
medicalemergencies. Because someof
the incidents we encounter are larger or
more technical than the resources readily
available to the Fire Department, we work
collaboratively with various departments
and agencies both in and outside the
Town. Some ofthese collaborations
include:

safety education program that will be
delivered to preschool, day care, grades K-
6, Boy and Girl Scout troops as well as
church, community groups and the
elderly. By visiting these groups on an
annual basis, the safety message that they
receive will become part of their lives and
each child, as they grow, will always be
aware offire safety. A total of
201,20967.was collected in revenue and
deposited in the general fund in 2001.
110,85696.was collected in non -permit

Training:
The primary objective of training is to
facilitate safe and effective operations.
National statistics continually cite
emergency vehicle operations as the
greatest are of liability. To that end, it was
the first major training area to be
addressed in 2010. A professional outside
agency was brought in to deliver an
emergency vehicle operator course to the
Department. Thecourseconsisted ofa
classroom component in which all general
laws and best practices were highlighted,
and a practical component in which all
members had to manipulate their assigned
apparatus through an obstacle course of
highway cones. This standardized
emergency vehicle operations class
parallels the commercial driver's license
course. This training helped to identify
needs and establish some goals and
objectives for the upcoming year's
training; specifically the daily vehicle
check, operator's brake system check and
new driver training. All three training
needs are in development and will be
implemented in the spring of 2011. The
Framingham Fire Department Training
Public Safety & Health 
will remain proactive in regards to safe
emergency 
vehicle operations.
The majority of training hours are devoted
to basic firefighting and medical rescue
skill maintenance. Most ofthis training is
conducted by the officers as company
level drills. Of the basic skills, the self
contained breathing apparatus ( SCBA)
poses the most liability and remains a top
training priority. SCBA training is broken
down into two sections- basic procedures
andemergency procedures. Onaregular
basis all members must demonstrate
proficiencyin both areas. Other company
level drills follow standardized tactics and
procedures and cover a diverse range of
skills such as ground ladders, hand tools,
extrication, metering devices and medical
care. With the exception ofSundays and
holidays, training is conducted on every
shift. All training is documented
electronically and quality controlled by the
training officer. Each Framingham
Firefighter logs hundreds of hours of
training annually.
Technical rescue disciplines are also an
integral part of the Department Trench 
96
Page 108
Town of Framingham
Annual Report
rescue, collapse rescue, confined space
rescue, hazardous materials response and
dive team operations are all specialized
areas that the Department is fortunate
enough to have several members actively
participating with established teams.
Members of the Department that are not
trained to the operational level must be
trained to a support level and be able to
operate in any technical rescue.
In addition to having our own highly
skilled Dive Team, the Framingham Fire
Department works cooperatively with the
State Hazardous Material Response Team
and the Fire District 14 Technical Rescue
Team.
Fire Alarm
The Fire Alarm Division is responsible for
the general maintenance of traffic signals,
controls, the municipal fire alarm system,
master boxes, street boxes and
underground and aerial cable.
Nine new master boxes were added in
2010. We now have atotal of910 boxes
in service in strategic locations throughout
Framingham. Of the 910 boxes, 553 are
master boxes that protect individual
properties and 357 are street boxes.
In addition to the regular duties of
maintaining and installing the fire alarm
and communication system, the Fire
Alarm Division was also responsible for
maintaining and repairing forty -four (44)
traffic signals, six (6) 4 -way flashing
signals and two (2) 30 mph "S" curve
signals. The following isabreakdown of
traffic signal repairs:
59 calls for traffic signals not working;
19 calls for signal heads turned;
32 calls for re- lamping traffic signals. 
2010
138 calls for changing of time, checking
preemption, Opticom, repair broken
pedestrian buttons, repair knock downs,
meetings with contractors digging up
roads to mark underground pipes,
meetings with contractors doing traffic
signal improvements, preventive
maintenance andinvestigations. 15
signals knocked -down in motor vehicle
accidents: 7 were reported to the Police
Department, 8were hitand run.
128 calls for school zone signals not
working properly that required time
adjustments, new lamps and new clock
installations. Thisalsoincluded time
adjustments made at the beginning and
end of the school year.
The Division installed approximately
2,200 feet of new fire alarm cable for new
master boxes and replacement of
deteriorated cable doubling the amount
installed in2010. 53pole transfers for
Verizon were completed.
The Fire Alarm Division worked jointly
with Fire Prevention in reviewing all fire
alarm plans submitted to the Department.
In addition, the Division attended
meetings with contractors for new interior
fire alarm installations and master box
locations. Both Fire Alarm and Fire
Prevention worked together to perform
interior fire alarm system inspections in
new and existing buildings.

Medical Reserve Corps (MRC)
The Framingham Medical Reserve Corps
MRC) is an approximately 200 member
local medical and non -medical volunteer
group trained in emergency preparedness
and is under the administration of the
Board of Health. The MRC is a
specialized component of a 34- community
emergency preparedness region, and a
member of the Local Emergency Planning
Committee (LEPC) and Citizen Corps, a
national network of volunteers dedicated
to homeland- hometown security. In 2010
the Framingham MRC continued to grow,
steered by the dedicated members of the
Executive Committee: Annette
Alderman, Alice Hsu, Annie Hsu,
Cindy Tracy, Dave Robbins, Florence
Goliger, Joan Metcalfe, Kathie
McCarthie who held monthly planning
meetings. This year Framingham was
named one of 13 sentinel communities in
Massachusetts which will represent the
entire state in the national Cities
Readiness Initiative. Members take
trainings including CPR, Incident
Command Systems, Medical Surge and
Public Safety & Health 
2010
Catastrophes, and Sheltering Vulnerable
Populations. Members also distributed
health information at local fairs, staffed a
shelter during the March floods, took part
in exercises related to emergency planning
and mass casualties, helped staff all of the
Town's flu clinics and were put on stand-
by status during multiple winter weather
events. In Mayan appreciation dinner,
attended by the Town Manager, Town
Selectmen, and Board ofHealth members,
was held to honor MRC volunteers and
the role they played in Framingham's very
successful response to the H1N1
pandemic.
East Middlesex
Project 
Mosquito Control
The East Middlesex Mosquito Control
Project conducts a program in
Framingham consisting of mosquito
surveillance, larval and adult mosquito
control, ditch maintenance and public
education.
Extreme flooding in March produced
mixed results with higher spring mosquito
populations emerging from forested
wetlands and lower mosquito populations
emerging from floodplain areas. Dry
weather during the late spring and
summer produced lower than normal
summer mosquito populations. Hot, dry
weather provided suitable conditions for a
developing risk of West Nile Virus that
resulted in 6  human cases in eastern
Massachusetts. Therewas an elevated risk
of EEE in southeastern Massachusetts
that resulted in a decision by the State to
intervene using wide -area aerial spraying.
The adult mosquito surveillance program
used traps to collect mosquitoes from 5
Framingham locations. Datawas
compiled from 22 mosquito trap
collections over 8 different nights. The
Project submitted 125 mosquito
collections from around the district that
102
Page 114
Town of Framingham
Annual Report
were tested for West Nile Virus and EEE
by the Mass. Dept. of Public Health.
The larval mosquito control program
relied on the larvicides, Bacillus thuraugieusis
var. israeleusis (Bti) and methoprene, which
are classified by the EPA as relatively non-
toxic. An April helicopterapplication of
Bti controlled mosquito larvae at 70
wetlandacres. Fieldcrewsusingportable
sprayers applied Bti in the spring and
summer to 27 wetland acres when high
densities of mosquito larvae were found in
stagnantwater. Project personnel applied
time -release methoprene pellets to control
Culex mosquito larvae at 5,324 roadside
catchbasins.
The Project used an excavator to maintain
519 feet of a waterway adjacent to
Georgetown Drive, and 144 feet of a
channelbyBlackberryLane. Ata 
2010
waterway beside Walnut St.,the excavator
was used to maintain 157 feet and Project
crews used hand tools to remove debris
from another 344 feet. Hand tools were
also used to maintain 180 feet of a ditch
beside Cherry St.
The Project's public education program is
designed to develop awareness within the
public and the private sectors as to their
roles inmosquito control. TheProject
serves as a resource to residents,
municipal officials and the local media on
mosquitoes and mosquito borne diseases.
A web page:

information on mosquitoes, control
programs and related topics.

For 2010, the Inspectors, Administrators
and Code Enforcement Inspectors within
the Building Department have had a very
active year providing quality customer
service and effective solutions toward
resolving citizen concerns. 
The focus of the Department continues to
be the pursuit of the highest quality of
public service by responding to concerns
as they arise, to follow up on previous
concerns, maintain a record of property
activities reviewed by inspectors and
investigators and be responsive to
consumer protection.

Annual Report
The Department continues to maintain a
recognized professional presence for its
staffforother communities. Aswework
toward hiring the best and most qualified
people to deliver the services expected
other communities see these qualities and
extend opportunities to staff members to
deliver similar services for their citizens.
In 2010, the Assistant Sign Officer,
Jennifer Baum tendered her resignation.
Jennifer had been with the office for four
years, during her time as the Assistant
Sign Officer, Jen did perform well
considering the complexities and the years
that sign enforcement was lax.
In view of the budget constraints
strangling the town in many ways, the
refilling of this position was weighed
heavily. The fact there is a need for sign
enforcement is  evident in the action
reports and permits issued. The question
on how to deliver this service without
sacrificing the other demands was solved
by reducing the position to part time. We
filled the position with the hiring of Paul
Kelly. Paul is a retired 30+ year police
detective with familiarity with the town
and its' citizens.
The office also filled 1  vacant Local
Inspector position with the hiring of
James Murphy. Jim is a resident of the
town and was alocal contractor. He has
excellent technical construction
knowledge and experience, which benefits
the town tremendously.
We continue to maintain 2  vacant
positions for local inspector and off hour
code enforcement. Aswith theAssistant
Sign Officer, we are currently accepting
application for a  part time Code
Enforcement Inspector. But again, as we
are uncertain as to the future budget we
are hesitant to offering the position to a
candidate without secure funding.
Public Safety & Health 
2010
We believe that the off hour code
enforcement is still a  high priority of
service required to address many of the
issues raised by the citizens within the
town. In light of the reduction of staff we
had to adjust how this service was to
continue. The inspector continues to work
all Saturdays and most evenings during the
Spring, Summer and Fall seasons. Due to
winter weather and concern for the safety
of the inspector we suspended evening
hour enforcement where it was proving to
be unproductive.
While Code Enforcement will continue to
be a priority where life safety is at risk, the
ability to be more proactive is limited by
the available resources. With the staff
reduction, the activity report is primarily a
reactive response for code enforcement.
Our primary focus where life safety risk is
the highest are those involved with
housing issues. The action report indicates
that the inspectors responded to over one
thousand (  1,000) complaints of which
more than 50% involved housing. The
report illustrates that the inspectors
addressed 78 Rooming House, 116 Illegal
Apartment, 27 Basement Apartment
complaints and monitored 194 foreclosed
properties.
We will continue to monitor the
foreclosure notices for properties within
the town for the near future. We have
determined that by being proactive in this
area we are able to deter blighted property
conditions and have the people who have
interest in these properties maintain them.
The data base contains critical
information for ownership, conditions of
the property, status, and use. Properties as
noted as being unoccupied are forwarded
to both the Framingham Police and Fire
104

Annual Report
Department who monitored and reported
conditions of change.
The Nuisance Officer has investigated and
pursued over 500 cases involving Trash &
Debris, Commercial Vehicles,
Unregistered Vehicles and Vehicles
Parking within the front Setback.
Sign enforcement did slip a little during
the six -month transition period from the
departure of Jen to the hiring and training
of Paul. The marginal differences are
evident within the permit history where
there is a reduction of 25% from the
previous year, and the same can be seen in
the action report for enforcement of 20%
less notices. 
2010
the past five year permit history. The total
receipts for 2010 were down by over
400,000 in comparison to the previous
year.
The office anticipated a decline in new
construction activity for 2010 and we do
not anticipate any large growth spurts for
2011. If construction trends continue as
they have in the past and maintain
consistency as they have these past 3
years. We expect both commercial and
residential property owners to continue
with upgrades, maintenance and minor
improvements. The permit staples ofthe
building department include roofs,
window, siding, decks, kitchen and
bathrooms.
With the adoption of the Sign Appeal
process by Town Meeting, there were
some who viewed this option as an
opportunity to derail the by right Sign By-
Law where the town would be smothered
in requests for variances to the ZBA. As
of the writing of this report, the ZBA has
heard seven ( 7) cases for sign variances,
granted five (5) and denied two (2).
The economic crisis and inflationary
effects on commodities and goods
provided high demand for consumer
protection. Jack Walsh, the Town's Sealer
and the Assistant Sealer, Ed Gentile
provided preventive and reactive response
service to monitor and address consumers
concerns. They investigated multiple cases
involving retail gas pricing, fuel oil
delivery services and retail price frauds.
The building permit activity for 2010
indicates that over 1900 permits were
issued for this period a decrease of less
than 2% ( 35) from 2009. The office issued
Eight (8) New single family home
building permits which is well below the
average of twenty -three (23) in reviewing 
The department overall permit issuance is
consistent with previous years with over
5100 permits issued across the board,
Building, Signs, Electrical Plumbing and
Gas. The field inspectors' logs are also
consistent with requests for service, with
each averaging 12 -14 stops per day.
2010 was an active year with multiple code
changes and it appears 2011 will provide
the same. In 2010 the State ofMass
adopted the 2009 International Building
Code (IBC) to replace the 7` edition 780
CMR the Mass State Building Code. In
addition to the 2009 IBC, the 2009
Energy Code was also implemented along
with 2009 Existing building Code. In the
adoption of the 2009 IBC the state also
adopted its' own 300 -page amendment.
The staff and I would also like to take this
time to congratulate Jack Walsh on his
retirement. After 30 plus years of civil
service with over 20 years with the Town
of Framingham, Jack retired on January
28, 2011. Finding a person to deliver the
services Jack provided is proving
challenging, and wewish him the best of
health and enjoyment.

The Department during 2010 saved
consumers and businesses in Framingham
well into the hundreds of thousands of

ENGINEERING AND
TRANSPORTATION DIVISION
The Engineering and Transportation Division
is responsible for the planning, design and
construction of capital roadway and utility
infrastructure projects, maintaining
compliance with various State & Federal
programs such as NPDES Phase II
Stormwater, managing the Town's Street
Opening Permit and Trench Opening Permit
programs, reviewing development and
redevelopment plans to ensure roadway and
utility changes conform to the Town's
construction standards, and inspecting
modifications and expansions to the roadway,
water, sewer and Stormwater networks. The
Division also provides technical expertise to
the operational divisions of the Public Works
Department, other Town Departments,
various Boards, Committees, and
Commissions, maintains anextensive
Geographical Information System (GIS) and
is the custodian of a large collection of
irreplaceable paper plans and documents.
A significant portion of the Division' s
resources were directed toward the
Department's extensive capital improvement
program. Many of the projects in this
program are mandated under MADEP
Administrative Consent Order (ACO). 
The ACO requires the Town to undertake
major sewer construction and rehabilitation
projects over several years with the primary
focus of alleviating reoccurring sanitary sewer
overflows, aviolation ofState and Federal
law. Failure to comply with the conditions of
the ACO can result in administrative civil or
criminal action. Continued improvements to
the infrastructure and maintenance
management of the wastewater system and
has resulted in significant reductions in Sewer
System Overflows (SSO's).
During 2010 thirty -five major capital
improvement projects were completed or
advanced. Over eighty -six thousand linear
feet (  over sixteen miles) of water and
wastewater main was replaced or rehabilitated.
Locations included Lillian Road, Lillian Road
Extension, New York Avenue, California
Avenue, Concord Street, Union Avenue,
Beulah Street, Auburn Street Extension,
Gorman Road, Hartford Street, Grant Street,
Grant Road Extension, Arthur Street, Maple
Street, Water Street, Edgell Road, Gates
Street, Parker Road, Salem End Road, Stalker
LaneandGoodnow Lane. Replacements of
the Ransom Road wastewater pump station
and the William J. Heights water booster
station were also completed. Construction
also began on the new A Street wastewater
management facility. Storm drain system

repairs were performed on Water Street and
an outfall off of Carter Drive was replaced.
Major transportation projects included the
reconstruction of eight thousand linear feet of
roadway, almost fourteen thousand linear feet
of sidewalk, and 37 new accessible sidewalk
ramps on Water Street; sidewalk replacements
on Winthrop Street; replacement of the Maple
Street stormwater culvert; and completion of
the Franklin Street Traffic and Roadway
Improvements project. The Franklin Street
work included ornamental traffic signals, and
brick paver crosswalks and sidewalk accents.
Emergency repairs to the Central Street
Bridge over the Sudbury River were designed
andimplemented. TheDivisionis
coordinating the design of a replacement
structure, anticipated for construction in 2013.
The Division also coordinated with the
MassDOT with respect to the repaving of
Route 9  and multiple bridge replacement
projects ( Fountain Street, Danforth Street,
Winter Street over the Sudbury River and
Winter Street over the CSX Railroad).
In 2010, two dozen design projects were
advanced, nine to completion. A major focus
was the Technology Park where additional
infrastructure improvements are necessary to
support continued economic development.
The Division is working closely with the
Massachusetts Life Science Center (MLSC) to
obtain grant funds over and above the $12.9
million the Town has already secured.
The Division assisted with planning for the
impending NPDES Phase II Stormwater
Permit revision. TheDivision formulated and
compiled comments on the draft permit
received from the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency. The Division continued
the second of three phases of a
comprehensive town -wide Stormwater Master
Plan and coordinated the implementation of
revised Flood Insurance Rate Maps prepared 
2010 Annual Report
by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
The Division continued a system -wide QA-
QC review of water GIS layers and raised the
status of those layers to Functionally
Complete; updated the building and parcel
layers; completed project -based updates from
Town capital projects; completed upgrades to
the Department's asset management software
and databases; provided web -based GIS
access to the Department's consultants;
updated snow plowing and sanding maps for
winter storm management; and provided GIS
mapping capability to the Town's permitting
software.
The Division completed electronic scanning
of over 10,000 historic paper record plans of
Town infrastructure, private property records,
Town property and easements, and street
acceptance plans. These electronic scans will
be cataloged in the Town's electronic
document management system for permanent
storage and retrieval.
The Division completed an update of
Pavement Condition Index for all Town
roadways ( 210+ miles of roadway).  The
update included a field assessment of the
pavement for each roadway, updates to the
pavement management backlog, an analysis of
pavement management funding needs,
updates to the Town's pavement asset
management software, and updates to the
Town's GIS.
Despite the sluggish economy, the volume of
2010 permit application approvals and
engineering plan reviews was at an average
level comparedwith prioryears. However the
Division permitted and inspected a record
1,000300, square feet of street openings, the
equivalent of reconstructing over 8 miles of
new roadway.

HIGHWAY MANAGEMENT
PROGRAM
The Highway Division is responsible for the
maintenance and repair of the Town's
roadway and sidewalk infrastructure including;
pavement markings, granite and bituminous
curbing, street and regulatory signage,
stormwater utilities, traffic islands, and street
trees.
Stormwater Management
The Stormwater Management System consists
of more than 200 miles of surface and
subsurface drainage systems, 12,200 catch
basin and manhole structures, and more than
600 drainage outfalls. 2010 construction
projects included Stormwater pipe and catch
basin installation on Spring Street and
Saybrook Road, as well as the repair of 152
drainage structures and the cleaning of
103,301 feetofdrain line. Thisworkwas
mostly performed by Department staff saving
a great deal of money in labor costs. The
Division has instituted a monthly inspection
practice in a proactive approach to drainage
structure maintenance
The Division is responsible for maintaining,
inspecting and operating the Town's
Saxonville flood levee system which consists
of 2,550 feet of earth dikes, 1,340 feet of
concrete flood walls, 1000 feet of channel
realignment, a pumping station, interior
drainage and a vehicular flood gate.
In order to maintain compliance with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's
Stormwater Phase II Permit, the Highway
Division made a vigorous year -long effort to
visit and clean as many of the drainage
structures as possible and with use of
contracted services, removed silt, sand, and
debris from approximately 8,200 catch basins.
The storm drain cleaning program has
continued to produce a significant repair list
as the inspection process proceeds. The
Beaver Dam Brook and Hop Brook continue
to be significant operational challenges for the
Division as even modest rain events may
Public Works 
2010 Annual Report
cause the brooks to surcharge at the many
culvert headwalls in both South Framingham
and the Gregory Road area of North
Framingham. The deficiencies in the
Stormwater systems throughout the Town are
a major cause of unscheduled overtime and
emergency repair cost incurred by the Town.
In order to minimize the amount of sand
entering and further diminishing the capacity
of the system, the Division has continued
strict control practices for the use of deicing
materials during the winter months. In
addition, a rapid and comprehensive post -
winter street cleaning program is performed
annually to remove as much sand as possible
from the streets and thereby minimize the
opportunity for accumulation in the drainage
system.
The Division also performed routine
overnight sweeping of the streets and
sidewalks of the commercial areas to
minimize the entry of materials into the
drainage system and to provide a cleaner
environment in the downtown area. The
removal of sand and debris from the Town's
catch basins and manholes remains an
operational priority each year.
Pavement Management
The 2010 construction projects included the
replacement or upgrade of roadway elements
and appurtenances so that both regulatory
guidelines and directives were adhered to and
visual enhancements could be made. New
pavement markings, street signs, sidewalks,
granite and bituminous curbing, wheelchair
ramps and curb -cut control measures were
addressed during construction. The projects
addressed more than seven miles of public
ways; this in addition to preventive and
emergency road and bridge repairs, and the
filling of over 12,000 potholes.
Winter Storm Management
The Highway Division is responsible for the
provision of a safe automotive and pedestrian
environment both during and after winter
110

Town of Framingham
storm events. This effort involves the plowing
and treating of 550 lane miles of public
roadway, 36 municipal parking facilities, 77
miles of sidewalks and public pathways, 183
crosswalks, 187 cul -de -sacs and 31 school
crossing -guard stations and student drop -off
areas. The Division has integrated the Town's
Geographical Information System (GIS) with
an Incident Command Structure to manage
each event. The purpose of this strategic
effort is  to provide a  high level of
accountability while applying the minimum
amount of resources to each storm event.
Tree Warden & Forestry Management
The Highway Division is responsible for the
maintenance management of the Town's
estimated 12,000 public street trees and for
the development of a  Public Shade Tree
program for the community. The purpose of
this program is to promote, preserve, and
enhance the shade tree environment of the
community through the application of best
management practices and public education
campaigns. The Department planted 25 trees
throughout the Town in 2010.
The Highway Division oversees the Town's
roadside vegetation management program
that is permitted annually by the
Massachusetts Department of Agricultural
ResourcesPesticideBureau. Thisprogram
allows the Department to apply best
management practices for the control of
curbside vegetation that otherwise would
grow uncontrollably and require the
commitment of substantial and sustained
labor to control growth.
A primary and recurring function of this
operating group is the statutory requirement
to maintain the 14' - 6" height clearance over
the 550 lane mile roadway network. The
Town's shade trees, while providing a great
public amenity to the Town, require routine
maintenance so that they do not also become
a public liability. 
2010 Annual Report
The Tree warden conducts frequent
hazardous tree assessments, prescribes
treatment, oversees removals, and participates
in public hearings on issues related to trees
within scenic ways. The Department routinely
responds to citizen inquiries and requests for
service, and Forestry Section personnel
removed 142 dead, diseased, and /or
hazardous street trees in 2010. The tree crews
performed tree pruning for road and sidewalk
clearance on several streets included in the
2010 Annual Road Resurfacing Plan.
Department staff continued a town -wide tree
survey to identify tree hazards and diseases so
that we may provide and promote tree health
and support and an overall accounting of
street trees which may benefit the Town of
Framingham in federal and state grant
applications.
Traffic Systems Management
The Traffic Systems section of the Highway
Division manages the maintenance,
fabrication, and placement of the Town's
regulatory and street signage, steel -beam
safety guardrail, installation of new and annual
maintenance of existing pavement markings,
and the work zone safety program for
Division operations. This section is
responsible for advance planning of traffic
management coordination for roadway
construction, as well as for the
implementation of street -by- street "no
parking" postings required to efficiently
advance the street sweeping program. The
pre -planning for traffic management during
the construction season maximizes the
efficient production of the work, and also
contributes to a safe environment for the
motorists and the work crews alike.
The Traffic Systems section managed the
contract and divisional painting of 113 miles
of yellow centerline, 23 miles of white edge
line, and over 600 crosswalks throughout the
Town.
Public Works  111
Page 123
Town of Framingham
In addition, the Division installed and or
replaced hundreds of regulatory signs and
advisory signs either by direction of the Board
of Selectmen or as required through routine
maintenance practices.
SOLID WASTE
PROGRAM 
MANAGEMENT
Solid Waste Management
The Solid Waste Management Program is
responsible for the management and oversight
of the Town's Solid Waste and Recycling
Programs. Materials are collected by means of
curbside and containerized collection
programs, the leaf and yard waste drop -off
area and the operation of a 
Resource
Recovery Center located on Mt. Wayte Ave.
The Division collects and manages the
collection of refuse and recycling from 19,503
dwelling units weekly, averaging more than
3,900 stops and 104,731 pounds per day
collected.
During the summer and fall of 2010 the
Division took the first steps to automating the
curbside recycling collection process town
wide. The Division oversaw the distribution
of wheeled carts to all properties included in
thecurbside service base. Thisdistribution
included approximately 10,000 64- gallon carts,
7,000 96- gallon carts and 200 35- gallon carts
forseniors anddisabled. Thedistribution of
these carts has allowed the Town to move to
an every other week curbside collection
schedule forrecyclables. This has achieveda
year one savings of $ 125,000 over the
previous collection method.
In 2010, the Division continued to employ a
multi facetted approach to decrease the
Town's overalltrash disposal costs. Some of
these approaches included:
1.  School and Municipal
participation; the school recycling
program continues to succeed and grow.
During this year the Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection
Public Works 
2010 Annual Report
has awarded the Town a $32,00, 000.two
year grant for a food composting pilot
program and the elimination of the use of
Styrofoam trays and plastic silverware.
Year one involves the Barbieri Elementary
School. This school alone disposes of
over 50,000 trays per year and double that
number in plastic utensils.
2.  Public Education; 2010 continued
the monthly theme and events program.
Two of these events continue to be
extremely popular withresidents. These
include the annual Electronics Day and
the Shred Fest (  secure confidential
document shredding).  Both events are
held at no additional charge to the
residents. The electronic take back day
has allowed the town to donate hundreds
of pounds of non -perishable food to local
food pantries as participating residents are
encouraged to make a  donation. In
addition to  events, the Division
performed two mass mailings explaining
the new recycling containers and what
items couldbe placed inthem. This
included one mailing to all property
owners and a 
second mailing to all
residents included in the Division' s service
base.
3.  Enhancements and Initiatives;
Single stream recycling, or "all in one
container ",  continues to be well received
andsuccessful. Single stream recycling
was a key component to moving to the
every other week recyclable collection in
the wheeled carts.
The Resource Recovery Center (RRC) located
on Mount Wayte Ave, continues to improve
and provides the Department the opportunity
to expand upontheservices offered. Last
year the Division issued 6,922 permits to
residents providing access to the solid waste
services offered at the facility. This represents
an additional 92 permits issued over 2009.
The center continues to provide excellent
service at reduced costs to the residents as
well as generate a significant revenue stream
for the town. The Town continues to partner
112
Page 124
Town of Framingham
with the Town of Wellesley in the marketing
of recyclables. Thishasallowedagreater
revenue stream to be produced for the
recyclables received. Through fees collected
for divisional services and marketing of the
recyclables during FY2010, $238,70575. was
generated fortheGeneralFund. This
represents a $16k increase over the previous
fiscal year.
The town continues to enjoy the successes
derived by making it easier for residents to
recycle. In addition to the hazardous and
hard to manage wastes collected at the RRC,
the center collected 430.65 tons of recyclables
while curbside recyclables totaled 4,11348.
tons. This represents a trash disposal cost
avoidance of $430.40.088.
WATER AND WASTEWATER
MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
The Water and Wastewater Program is
responsible for the provision of a drinking
water supply, a fire suppression service, and a
sewer collection service to the 70,000
residents of the community that it serves.
The Water Department is responsible for the
distribution of a public potable water supply
and for the provision of fire suppression
service to the 17,000 residential and
commercial accounts within the community.
The average daily water demand of nearly
seven million gallons per day ( mgd) is
purchased from the Massachusetts Water
Resources Authority (  MWRA) and is
subsequently distributed throughout the
Town by means of a complicated system of
pumps, pipes, valves, and reservoirs. The
Water Department program provides for the
maintenance and repair to the water
distribution infrastructure that includes; 250
miles of pipe, 17,000 service connections,
2,000 hydrants, 4,800 gate valves, 22,000
meters, 4  pumping stations, 3  booster
stations, and 6 above ground water tanks
having a storage capacity of nearly 9 million
gallons.
Public Works 
2010 Annual Report
The Wastewater Department is responsible
for the collection and transport of 10 million
gallons of sewage each day, a  significant
portion of which is infiltration and inflow
I /I) from sources such as leaking pipes and
sump pump discharges during wet weather.
Sewage is conveyed from town systems to the
MWTZA which is charged with the transport
and treatment of sewerage from its forty -three
member communities. The town's collection
system consists of 226 miles of gravity mains,
18 miles of force mains, 50 pump stations,
6,600 manholes, and over 40 miles of cross -
country sewer -line easements.
The Division's capital improvement programs
have been substantially under funded in
recent decades and, as a consequence, the
critical infrastructure is experiencing ever
increasing incidents of failure. The system
continued to grow and expand over time, but
the funding for the aging and expanding
infrastructure did not keep pace with capital
needs. As a consequence, the Division was
historically engaged solely in performing
unscheduled maintenance and was unable to
devote resources to perform critical
maintenance to the system. This is
underscored by the issuance of an
Administrative Consent Order (ACO) and
Notice of Noncompliance by the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection ( MADEP) during March 2007.
The ACO requires the Town to undertake
major sewer construction and rehabilitation
projects over several years with the primary
focus of alleviating reoccurring sanitary sewer
overflows, a violation of State and Federal
law. The ACO has several other requirements
including increased staffing levels, major
equipment purchases, implementation ofa
SCADA system to remotely monitor and
control pumping stations and strict reporting
requirements. Failure to comply with the
conditions of the ACO can result in
administrative civil or criminal action.
113
Page 125
Town of Framingham
The Department also faces the continuing
challenges of managing another
Administrative Order originally issued by the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority in
2003. The MWRA Settlement Agreement
limits the level of sulfide that the Town is
authorized to discharge to the MWRA system
through operational efforts. Sulfide generation
can cause odor and corrosion problems in
sewers which sometimes can be catastrophic.
Activities which the Wastewater Department
performs to mitigate the generation of sulfide
include chemical dosing at selected
wastewater pumping stations, targeted
collection system cleaning and inspection, and
enforcement of grease interceptor
requirements at food establishments. A major
cause of sulfide is the wastewater detention
time associated with the 50 pumping stations
and 19 miles of related sewer force main
sewer. The Department plans on eliminating
up to eight wastewater pumping stations and
related force mains over the next several years
as part of its Capital program.
In recent years the Department of Public
Works has developed a  professional and
knowledge staff at all levels and disciplines.
This progression has provided an opportunity
to identify and fully carry out some capital
projects from design through construction
using solely Public Works staff. This practice
not only provides the Town with a significant
cost savings over contracting for these
services but is used as a tool for continually
training our employees. During 2010 water or
sewer infrastructure was replaced using this
approach in Ransom Road, Winthrop Street,
Kendall Avenue and Fredrick Street.
The aforementioned construction activities
were in addition to the excavations required
by department staff to repair over 280 water
system failures and 220 sewer system failures
during the course of the year. Additionally the
Water and Wastewater Division responded to
over 900 first response calls and replaced over
65 hydrants. The Wastewater division, with
the help of a newly acquired camera truck,
provided video inspection of over 87,565
Public Works 
2010 Annual Report
linear feet of sewer pipes an 80 % increase
over 2009. The inspection process reveals
areas of the system that have potential
problems that may require repair or
replacement.
The Department began installation of the
Automated Meter Reading ( AMR) system
early in 2009 and approximately 99% of the
town's water meters are now being read
remotely. The AMR system provides the
utility billing office with real time, on demand,
water meter readings providing a substantially
higher level of customer service to water and
sewer customers. It is anticipated that all
21,000 meters will be outfitted with the new
reading device in early 2011.
In collaboration with NSTAR Electric
measures were taken to retrofit many of the
older pump stations enabling the stations to
operatewith higherefficiency. These energy
saving devices have lowered our power
requirements.
The Water and Wastewater Department' s
Emergency Standards were updated during
2010 to comply with the revised American
Water Works recommendations for
construction. Currently the department is
revising the drinking water regulations. New
regulations include specific requirements for
Emergency Response Plans and notification
requirements for reporting emergencies to the
MADEP, and the Board of Health such as
with a loss ofwater supply, contamination
incident, acts of vandalism and other potential
or actual emergencies requiring an immediate
action in order to protect public health.

Protection, etc. to protect the Town's wetland
resource areas and open space.
FLEET, FACILITIES AND
COMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM
The Fleet, Facilities and Communications
program continues to provide a critical
support service to various public works
programs and provides vehicle and equipment
maintenance support to other agencies within
the Town. The Program is accountable for;
the development and implementation of
professional fleet management standards and
practices, the design and procurement ofall
public works vehicles and equipment, and for
providing standardized maintenance
management practices for all public works
facilities including water and wastewater
pumping stations. The Division is also
charged with the technical management of the
telecommunications network and thereby
provides a critical service component to the
Department's Emergency Management
Response Plan. 
115
Page 127
Town of Framingham
The Fleet, Facility, and Communications
Division's role is to provide logistical support
to the Department through the provision of
fully operational equipment, facilities, and
telecommunications that together, ensure the
effective and efficient delivery of essential
services to the residents of the community.
These vital services include the provision of
public safety, public works, and public utility
functions for the residents of Framingham.
This year the Town of Framingham's Police
Department and Department of Public Works
became one of three major equipment and
materials cache sites for the Northeast
Homeland Security Regional Advisory
Council (NERAC).The Department of Public
Works stores and monitors the equipment
and materials and is prepared to assist in
distribution of these items if needed during a
declared state of emergency.
Fleet Management
In 2010 the Division oversaw the conversion
of a  68,000 gross vehicle weight ( GVW)
refuse packer cab & chassis to a snow fighter
with a permanent mount fourteen cubic yard
sander for use in winter operations. This unit
is equipped with an eleven foot front plow
and an underbody scraper and maintains one
of the Town's many major hub plow routes.
The vehicle's large size is advantageous during
winter operations as it can stay out longer,
holding more material.
The Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection has supplied the
Town with three retrofit kits to help reduce
emissions on our older refuse packers. This
was accomplished with the Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection
Retrofit Grant Program.
This year the Department was able to acquire
a Hybrid /Diesel Pipeline Television
Inspection Vehicle for the Wastewater
Division. The Hybrid upgrade for this piece
Public Works 
2010 Annual Report
of equipment was funded via a grant from the
Department of Energy Resources.
We have had several technician training
sessions both in -house and off site to help
keep our technicians current with the ever
changing industry. This included an American
Public Works Association' s annual Mechanics
Workshop that was hosted by the Fleet
Services Division and included technicians
from other municipalities.
This has been the fourth winter season using a
temporary site at the King School for
technicians who are assigned to be on the
north side of town during plowing events.
This has worked very well in providing the
technicians a more functional area to work so
repairs can be performed more effectively and
reducing the vehicle's `out of service' time that
would occur returning to the Western Avenue
facility.
In 2010, Fleet Services wrote 2 repair
orders, performed 444 scheduled preventative
maintenance services and performed 161
Commonwealth of Massachusetts Registry of
Motor Vehicles Enhanced Emissions State
Inspections.
The Division also managed the acquisition &
distribution of more than 237,500 gallons of
gasoline & diesel fuel.
The Department participated in a Toyota
Prins Plug -in Hybrid evaluation program. The
goal of the program was to help Toyota
determine how Plug -In Hybrid vehicles would
perform in a fleet environment.
Facility Maintenance
Each year the Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection's Stage II Vapor
Recovery Certification program is performed
for the fuel system at Western Avenue along
with the annual calibration of the fuel pumps
which is performed by the Town's Sealer of
Weights & Measurers. The oil /water
separators at Western Avenue and the Mt.
116
Page 128
Town of Framingham
Wayte recycling facility are inspected quarterly
and pumped out in compliance with DEP
regulations as needed but at least annually.
Full load tests were performed on the
emergency/ standby generators at both the
Western Avenue and Henry Street facilities.
This is done quarterly to insure proper
operation along with a semi -annual
maintenance program. The annual fire
sprinkler inspection was performed at the
Western Avenue facility.
This year the fuel island pad was replaced at
the Western Avenue facility due to major
deterioration.
We have begun a replacement program of the
yard lighting at the Western Avenue facility.
The lighting units are being replaced with
energy efficient LED pole lights. This
replacement program is  partially funded
through an NSTAR grant and should be
completed early in 2011.
This year the equipment wash bay located at
Western Avenue was refurbished due to
corrosion on the major steel support beams.
The repair to the beams was accomplished by
the Fleet Services Welder/ Fabricator.
The Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure Plan (  SPCCP) has been
updated as per Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection regulations. This
plan is necessary so there are guidelines in
place to respond to any type of uncontrolled
release of hazardous materials. This plan also
includes all of the town's pumping stations
and the Resource Recovery Center.
Fleet Services continues to do a monthly
inspection of the Watson Place flood station
and performs any necessary repairs.
ADMINISTRATION & FINANCE
The Administration and Finance Division
provides for the consolidation of all
administrative and financial functions within
the Department of Public Works. The
Public Works 
2010 Annual Report
Division strives to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of financial and administrative
functions within the Department through the
use of professional practices.
The core mission of the Division of
Administration & Finance is to provide
service and technical support to the major
Divisions within the Department of Public
Works: Engineering, Conservation, Highway,
Solid Waste, Fleet, Water and Wastewater as
well as providing other Town Departments
with information in a timely and accurate
manner.
The Division is also responsible for the
management of grant funding, as well as
federal reimbursement activities that are
related to storm emergencies and other
events.
Water and Sewer utility billings for the Town
of Framingham are also managed by this
Division. Staff issued approximately 73,000
billsin2010. Residential customers in
Framingham are billed quarterly for water and
sewer usage, while commercial, industrial and
high volume customers are billed monthly.
The staff also administers the Senior Discount
and Utility Abatement policies on behalf of
the Board of Selectmen.
In July 2010 a new software system was
implemented for utility billing activities. This
robust software along with the benefits of the
automated meter reading ( AMR) system
greatly improved the efficiency and accuracy
of utility billing and enhanced customer
service. The AMRtechnologyprovides meter
readings for each property four times a day.
This feature has been an important tool in
helping customers understand their usage and
identify leaks.
During 2010 the division completed the
implementation of an automated time and
attendance system used by Public Works
Departments. The system records an
employee's hours worked and other payroll
117

Town of Framingham
related costs. The system provides more
accurate tracking of hours and offers
management a range of labor reporting.
Department staff worked with representatives
from the Federal Emergency Management
Administration (  FEMA) on a 
declared
emergency. Two periods of intense rainfall
and high winds occurring between March and
April 2010 caused damage throughout town.
The department documented its costs and
submitted a 
claim for approximately
200,00.000. 
2010 Annual Report
Members of the department oversaw the
Drainlayer License renewal process, the
processing of personnel related activities for
the 150 members of the Public Works
Department as well as the processing of
thousands of vendor invoices.

Community & Economic Development
NW Memorial Building, Rm B2 1508-5455532-1  planning .department @framinghamma.gov
The Community and Economic
Development Division (C &ED)
undertakes a wide variety of projects, all
of which are focused on protecting and
enhancing the quality of life for
Framingham's residents. The projects are
multi- dimensional, ranging from securing
grants and providing policy analyses to
promoting homeownership and
strengthening the tax base by encouraging
appropriate new development.
The Division consists of three
departments: Planning, Zoning Board of
Appeals (ZBA),and the federally funded
Community Development office. While
each department focuses on different
planning functions, there are strong
interrelationships between and amongst
the departments as well as other municipal
divisions, boards and committees. 
Consisting of four interconnected
components, the Plan is focused on:
recognizing and supporting the critical
roles that the commercial sector plays in
improving the quality of life for
Framingham residents by contributing to
the tax base, supplying employment
opportunities, and providing a diversity of
goods and services.
Promote Downtown Revitalization
The department coordinates ongoing and
planned projects directed at revitalizing
Framingham's central business district.
C &ED works closely with the Town
Manager, Department of Public Works,
Building and Wires Department, and
Planning Board as well as state, regional
and federal agencies and legislators to
insure that all projects are moving forward
in a coordinated and expeditious manner.
PLANNING
The Planning component of the Division
is concentrated on both promoting
economic development and supporting
ourresidential neighborhoods. Planners
also manage a wide variety of projects and
provide policy analyses requested by the
Town Manager, Board of Selectmen, and
other divisions.
Economic Development
The department is committed to
encouraging appropriate economic
development in order to expand and
strengthen the tax base, thereby
contributing to the fiscal health of the
town. Planners are responsible for
implementing the Town Manager's
Economic Development Strategic Plan. 
Underlying the Town's approach to
improving the economic viability of
Downtown Framingham is the
recognition that public infrastructure
improvements are critical to leverage
private investment. Public investment is
directed at facilitating vehicular and
pedestrian circulation patterns, improving
safety, and beautifying the downtown as
well as upgrading water and sewer
infrastructure.
Working with DPW and its consultant as
well as Planning Board staff, C &ED has
helped guide the development of a long-
term revitalization strategy for the
downtown that addresses the rail crossing
issue, seeks to incorporate Farm Pond
into the downtown, promotes mixed -use
Planning & Economic Development  122
Page 134
Town of Framingham
Annual Report
development, significantly improves safety
and traffic flow, and enhances the physical
appeal of the downtown.
The State is currently undertaking an
Environmental Review of a long -term
plan to introduce a grade separation into
thedowntown. Simultaneously, theTown
is engaged in discussions with both the
State Government—including the Lt.
Governor —and CSX, which owns over
200 acres of land dedicated to railroad use
in the downtown.
Plans to effect significant vehicular and
pedestrian improvements that will address
traffic flow and improve safety have also
been developed. These plans, combined
with major streetscape improvements to
beautify the downtown and help entice
visitors to the district are nearing 25%
completion. It is anticipated thatthe State
will sponsor a public hearing in 2011 to
solicit input into the design plans.
Finally, the department is exploring the
applicability of the National Trust for
Historic Preservation' s Main Street
Program to downtown Framingham.
Framingham Downtown Renaissance
C &ED staff works with Framingham
Downtown Renaissance (FDR),a non-
profit organization focused on the
revitalization of our downtown.
Revitalize Neighborhood Commercial
Areas
Whereas the downtown is a focus of the
department's economic development
efforts, it is clearly just one of a number
of projects that have undertaken or
expanded upon during 2010. The
commercial centers in Nobscot and along
Mount Wayte /Franklin Streets were
identified as areas that warrant
revitalization. C &ED maintained its 
2010
previously established relationships with
the property owners and continued to
convey the Town's willingness— indeed
eagerness—to work closely with them and
any prospective tenants or buyers in order
to revitalize those areas.
Implement Brownfields Project
Framingham has a considerable number
of Brownfields, which are properties that
contain or potentially contain hazardous
substances, pollutants or contaminants
that complicate the property's expansion
or redevelopment. Brownfields are not
only a blighting influence on their
surroundings, but are typically
underutilized, thereby representing
enormous potential to generate significant
new property taxes once they are abated
or it is established that they are not
contaminated.
The department has focused significant
energy on securing funding to identify,
abate and eventually redevelop
Brownfields. Our efforts to secure
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
funding have been successful and will
continue in future years. C &ED has
received two $200,000 grants from the
EPA to undertake comprehensive site
assessments ofBrownfields. TheDivision
applied for a third grant from EPA in
2010 and will receive notification during
2011.
The Division continues to implement the
Brownfields Project, which involves
targeting sites, working with property
owners, and hiring a licensed site
professional to conduct Environmental
Site Assessments (ESAs) of selected
properties. The Town's consultant has
undertaken nine ESAs including several
for a potential community garden and for
a new branch library proposed for
Nobscot.

Annual Report
Encourage Appropriate Economic
Development
New development is one of the few
mechanisms available to expand the tax
base, thereby reducing the financial
burden on existing property owners
and /or increasing the availability of
funding toimprove municipal services. In
recognition of the tremendous potential
of Technology Park, C &ED works with
both prospective developers and the State
to encourage and facilitate appropriate
development. C &ED participates in a
quarterly meeting with Tech Park property
owners and tenants together with Town
officials to identify issues of mutual
concern and how we can strengthen our
partnership to address these issues.
The department is also working to target
and promote the development of major
parcels for (re)development throughout
town. Although the lack of available
credit has seriously undermined the
progress of several private developments,
we are focused on some of the
opportunities presented by vacant and
underutilized property in the downtown
and community -wide.
Protect and Improve Residential
Neighborhoods
While economic development initiatives
support residential neighborhoods by
generating additional taxes, C &ED also
undertook projects that were directed
specifically at protecting and improving
Framingham's neighborhoods. The
department continued to respond to a
Board of Selectmen policy that places a
priority on encouraging homeownership
and targeting efforts to vulnerable
neighborhoods. Both the Community
Development Block Grant and HOME
Programs are focused on improving
neighborhoods. 
2010
Work with DPW to Minimize
Construction Impacts
Given its commitment to help support
existing businesses, C &ED worked closely
with DPW to minimize impacts caused by
construction of major capital
improvements to the town's
infrastructure. Thismunicipal partnership
will continue in future years in order to
assist the business community.
Neighborhood Stabilization Program
The dramatic increase in home
foreclosures that began in 2008 persisted
in 2010. C &ED continued to implement
the Neighborhood Stabilization Program
NSP),funded by three grants secured and
administered by C &ED totaling $1.35
million.
The success of NSP represents the
combined efforts of C &ED and the
Board of Selectmen as well as the direct
and critically important involvement of
the Framingham Housing Authority
FHA) and its subsidiary, the Framingham
Housing Development Corporation
FHDC). The overriding focus of NSP is
to acquire and convert foreclosed
properties into owner -occupied homes to
reduce the potential for blight and help
stabilize neighborhoods.
Thus far, the program has resulted in the
purchase of five homes, four of which
have been completely renovated, and one
of which has been sold to an income -
eligible family. Sale of a second unit is
pending, and a two- family has been
retained by FHDC, which will be placing
two families in the units during 2011. The
fourth property is for sale and renovation
of the fifth property, which will be
converted from a three- family to a single -
family, will start in the spring of 2011
using the proceeds from the first sale.
These renovated properties have
Planning & Economic Development  124

improved the appearance of the
neighborhoods in which they are situated
As the NSP properties are sold, additional
properties will be acquired, rehabilitated
andsoldwith the sales proceeds. For

www.framin
Promote the Town
Interrelated with both the Economic
Development and Neighborhood Services
Strategic Plans, a concerted effort is
underway to market the desirable
attributes of Framingham in order to
encourage individuals, families and firms
to locate, invest, and shop in our town. A
marketing brochure was developed and
released to major employers, brokers and
banks during 2010. As an extension of
the Branding Study, C &ED staff has
developed a marketing campaign, a major
component of which is a web site created
in conjunction with Technology Services.
The two divisions will continue to refine
the web site, which can be accessed by
clicking on www.comchooseframingham.
The site will eventually be populated with
businesses and linked to brokers.
Pursue State and Federal Grants
The department continued to analyze the
applicability of grants as well as research
the availability of funding for specific
projects. Inordertoinsure thatall
municipal departments are eligible to
receive State grants, the department
annually submits an application to the
Commonwealth Capital Program, which
essentially grades municipalities on their
success in meeting State objectives and
mandates. Framinghamwas awarded the
5th highest score in Massachusetts in
2010, which positions us extremely well
for a wide variety of state grants. 
2010
The department applied for and received
over $1.2 million in grants during 2010 as
follows:
150,000 Attorney General's Housing
Rehabilitation Grant
500,000
585,000

The department participated with MAPC
in that agency's successful $5 million
Regional Planning Sustainable
Communities Grant application. A
portion of those funds will be used to
evaluate transportation issues associated
with Technology Park.
The extraordinary assistance and
cooperation provided by other municipal
and school departments have been
instrumental in the C &ED's success in
securing grants. Similarly, the department
is available to provide direct staff support
to divisions throughout the Town in
identifying and preparing grant
applications.
Undertake Policy Analyses, Studies,
Project Management, and Special
Projects
C &ED undertakes projects, prepares
policy analyses, and coordinates inter-
departmental projects. Some of these
2010 projects include the following:

Annual Report
Sign Appeal Process Working Group
C &ED participated in a staff level
working group formed by the Board of
Selectmen to review the sign appeal
process. The working group met with
stakeholders, commercial property owners
and the Planning Board. Theworking
group's recommendations were adopted
by Town Meeting in May.
Wireless Communication Facilities
Working Group
C &ED participated in a staff -level
working group formed by the Board of
Selectmen to review the wireless
communications facility (WCF) zoning
bylaw. The working group's
recommendation was adopted by the
Board ofSelectmen in September. The
working group will start meeting with a
consultant in 2011 to review our WCF
bylaw and identify how the needs of the
wireless industry can be accommodated
with least impact to our neighborhoods.
Open Space Plan Implementation
Committee
C &ED staffs a committee that was
formed to begin implementation of the
2008 Open Space and Recreation Plan. The
committee' s first task was to review the
town's three aqueducts— Weston,
Hultman, and Sudbury —and assess how
best to improve their recreational use. The
committee will continue to meet during
the upcoming calendar year.
Transportation
C &ED works closely with DPW to insure
that the Town's transportation
improvement priorities are identified on
the state's Transportation Improvement
Plan (TIP),which is a prerequisite for
federal and state funding. 
2010
Cochituate Rail Trail (CRT
C &ED is responsible for the design and
ultimate construction of the 1.3 -mile CRT
in Saxonville. Plans to enter into a 99 -year
lease with the MBTA were replaced with
acquisition of the property in February of
2010 in order to accommodate the DPW' s
East Framingham Sewer Improvement
Project (EFSIP).C &ED is working
closely with DPW to coordinate design
and construction activities along the rail
trail. Design plans for the trail have been
prepared and the project permitted by the
Conservation Commission. Thebasic
infrastructure of the trail is under
construction as part of the EFSIP project.
C &ED submitted applications for state
transportation funds and the state
awarded the Town $585,000 to complete
the CRT. Itis anticipated that the CRT
will be completed in 2012.
Bruce Freeman Rail Trail (BFEX
C &ED manages the planning process to
develop the Framingham component of
the proposed 35 -mile rail trail that will
extendfromLowelltoFramingham. A
6.8 mile portion of the BFRT in
Chelmsford opened in 2009. C &ED has
been seeking grant funding as well as
working with the regional committee
representing all of the communities
through which the trail will traverse.
Subsidized Housing Inventory
The Division carefully monitors the
Town's status on the Commonwealth's
Subsidized Housing Inventory (SHI) in
order to insure that Framingham' s
subsidized housing units are accurately
and fully counted. The Town's SHI
remains in excess of 10 %,  which limits the
applicability of Chapter 40B
Comprehensive Permits (subsidized
housing development that is not subject
to municipal Zoning Codes).The Division
Planning & Economic Development  126
Page 138
Town of Framingham
Annual Report
insured that the 150 units created by
Jewish Community Housing for the
Elderly at the Shillman House were
incorporated into the inventory in a timely
fashion.
Provide Support to Town Committees
C &ED provides staff support to several
Town committees, including:
Economic Development Industrial
Corporation ( EDICT
The EDIC is charged with creating a pro-
active capacity within the town to plan for
and carry out economic development
activities. The EDIC hasparticipated in
the Town's Brownfields Program and
branding efforts.
AgEicultural Advisory Committee (,LAC)
The Committee, with staff support from
C &ED, focused a great deal of its
attention on creating a community garden
in South Framingham in order to help
stabilize the neighborhood, improve the
health and nutrition of residents, serve as
an educational vehicle, and build a sense
ofcommunity. Afterevaluating more
than 250 properties, the AAC identified a
parcel owned by the Parks and Recreation
Department. TheTown'sBrownfields
Grants funded a title search and two
environmental siteassessments. The
AAC and planning staff also worked with
the Sudbury Valley Trustees to secure
funding for the construction of the
community garden. The AAC began
work with the Parks and Recreation
Department to develop plans to build and
maintain thegarden. The Committee also
provided input to the Planning Board
regarding Master Plan goals and policies,
and reviewed and commented on farming -
related bills pending before the State and
Federal legislatures.

ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
Memorial Building, Room B2 (508)532-
5456 zba@framinghamma.gov
The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) is
the Permit Granting Authority and the
Special Permit Granting Authority for
those projects not meeting the
requirements of the Framingham Zoning
Bylaws. The ZBA's function is to approve
or deny requests for variances and special
permits, and issue findings through the
public hearing process by determining if
the required criteria, as stated in the
Zoning Bylaw, have been met. In
addition, the ZBA administers the
Comprehensive Permit process for
affordable housing as set forth under
M.L. G.Chapter 40B.
The ZBA is a three- member Board
appointed by the Selectmen. In 2010, Full
Members of the Board were Philip R.
Ottaviani, Jr.,Chair; Susan S. Craighead,
Vice -Chair; and Stephen E. Meltzer,
Clerk. Karl Thober, Edward (Ted)
Cosgrove, Robert Snider and Kevin
Gatlin served as Associate Members.
Eugene Kennedy, Assistant Director of
Community and Economic Development,
continued his duties as ZBA
Administrator. Mr. Kennedy prepared the
Board's decisions and advised the Board
on procedural and other issues. Alice

Annual Report
Clapper continued her duties as
Administrative Assistant. Town Counsel
continued to advise the Board as required
Fifty -two (52) petitions were filed with the
ZBA office in 2010. Nine (9) petitions
that were filed in 2009 were decided in
2010. This total of sixty -one (61) cases is
17% more than the fifty -two (52) cases
processed in 2009.
Of the sixty -one (61) cases heard in 2010,
11 were requests for variances, 36 for
special permits, 5 for findings, 6 for
variance & special permits, and 3 appeals
of the decision of the Building
Commissioner. Variance and special
permit requests included those for relief
from dimensional requirements for:
construction of, and additions to, single
family homes; placement of sheds on
residential properties; construction of
two- family residences, and automotive
and restaurant uses; and changes of use
for local businesses. Some of these filings
were the outcome of changes in zoning
districts in past years resulting in non-
conforming lots.
An additional responsibility that was
delegated to the ZBA in 2010 was the
Sign Appeal Process. Three Associate
Members presided over sign appeal
applications, with the fourth Member
selected as the Alternate. Nine (9)
applications were filed and decided. The
hearings were held on the same evening as
the regular ZBA meetings.
The Board generally meets on the second
and fourth Tuesdays of every month at
7:00 P.M. in the Deborah D. Blumer
Community Hearing Room. Members of
the public are welcome and encouraged to
attend ZBA meetings. 
2010
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AND HOME PROGRAMS
Since 1975, Framingham has received
over 19 million dollars in Federal
Community Development Block Grant
Program (CDBG) funds. The Town also
receives federal Home Investment
Partnership Act (HOME) funds, which
are directed exclusively to developing and
rehabilitating residential units. In
combination, the programs seek to: arrest
deterioration in the housing stock and
stabilize neighborhoods through financial
and technical rehabilitation assistance to
property owners; develop programs to
preserve and expand affordable housing
opportunities; eliminate architectural
barriers; improve Town -owned facilities
and infrastructure to prolong their useful
lives and stabilize eligible neighborhoods;
improve the quality of life for low and
moderate income residents through the
provision of social services; and
administer the programs effectively and
equitably to ensure that all members of
the community can participate in or
benefit from program activities.
The following summarizes several major
accomplishments during 2010:
Housing Rehabilitation Assistance
HRAP)
HRAP provides technical and financial
assistance for the rehabilitation of housing
units. Sixteen living units were helped or
were in the process of being helped
through HRAP assistance and related
services through the provision of grants
and loans to property owners who have
low or moderate incomes or the majority
of whose tenants have low or moderate
incomes. HOME fundswerealsousedto
undertake the rehabilitation of four
additional housing units. Staff provided
administrative support in the Division's
implementation of the Neighborhood
Planning & Economic Development  128
Page 140
Town of Framingham
Annual Report
Stabilization Program featuring the
acquisition, rehabilitation, and resale of
foreclosed and abandoned property.
Homebuyer Assistance
CDBG provided homeownership
opportunities to income -eligible
households with CDBG and HOME
funds. Two households intheincome
range of 80 -100% of median family
income became homeowners through the
Program's referral of those households to
the MassHousing Partnership Soft Second
Loan Program.
Code Enforcement
The Program provides funding to conduct
code -related inspections to properties
located in eleven Census Block Groups,
each with a population that predominantly
has low or moderate incomes.
Inspectional staff (with the equivalent of
one full -time position made possible by
CDBG funds) and one administrative
staff person were employed by the
Building Department. Staffspeaks and
understands Spanish and Portuguese. The
Building Department maintains a data
base on inspectional findings and then
maps where problems are occurring.
During the past program year, over 500
inspectional cases were initiated and
closed.
Public Facilities Improvements:
Accessibility Adaptations
CDBG grants continued to fund several
handicapped accessibility improvements
to the Memorial Building, including the
installation of a new automated lift linking
the first floor to the Union Avenue
meetingroomandofficewing. The
program also funded: the installation of
new sidewalk and accessible curb cuts
along Winthrop Street in the Coburnville
neighborhood; construction of accessible 
2010
sidewalks and a pedestrian crossing area;
and renovation of water, sewer, and
drainage connections and initial street
resurfacing at the Rose Kennedy Lane
Elderly Housing Complex.
CDBG funds were allocated to study,
design, and eventually construct an
accessible entrance to the Village Hall.
Funds were used to upgrade public parks
and recreational facilities including the
final phase of installation of more energy
efficient and effective lighting in the
heavily used Danforth Gymnasium, and
the installation of new play equipment and
landscaping to complement a newly
developed family play area at Butterworth
Park.
Facade & Sign Improvement Program
Assistance was offered to business and
property owners as well as merchants
located in and around Framingham's
central business district and surrounding
commercial core in order to undertake
facade, signage, and storefront
improvements. One sign improvement
project was completed and while three
other local businesses were assisted with
funds to help design new signage that will
be installed at a later date.
Public Services
The following initiatives were undertaken
with CDBG funds to serve youth: a
summer employment and counseling
program (Community Connections
Summer Work Program);and a special
program for high school students who
faced issues that have impeded their
ability to learn and achieve (Resiliency for
Life).CDBG- funded adult programs
included: literacy training (Literacy
Unlimited);English -as -a- Second Language
Framingham Adult ESL Plus);and
limited financial assistance to prevent
homelessness (Homeless Prevention
Planning & Economic Development  129
Page 141
Town of Framingham
Annual Report
Program).Over 400 individuals were
served by the activities.
Subsidized Housing Support
HOME funds supported subsidized
housing projects including: Shillman
House OCHE) design costs (10 housing
units),FHA Memorial House design costs
10 units),and FHA Rose Kennedy Lane
rehabilitation ( 14 units placed under
agreement). 
2010
Administration
Administration of both the CDBG and
HOME Programs is staff intensive and
requires diligence to identify relevant
regulations and to abide by those
regulations. CDBG and HOME funding
fully pay for staff assigned to manage the
programs.

SPECIAL PLANNING STUDIES
Town wide Master Plan
In relation to preparation of a Master
Plan, M.L, G.Chapter 41 81D states, "A
planning board established in a city or
town or such part or parts thereof as said
board may deem advisable and from time
to time may extend or perfect such plan ".
In 2007, the Board began the
development of Framingham's first
comprehensive Master Plan since 1988.
The Board completed the first phase of
the Master Plan and published the
Baseline Conditions Report, which is
availableonline. Thecommencement of
the second phase of the Master Plan was
delayed, due to lack of funding. Town
Meeting approved the appropriation of
unassigned mitigation funds to complete
the Master Plan.
The Board has engaged the Cecil Group
to complete the plan. The Cecil Group
has held meetings with Board members
andwithotherstakeholders. Thedraft
goals and policies with implementation
strategies were completed in 2010. The
Planning Board recently posted an
electronic survey to solicit additional
Planning & Economic Development  133
Page 145
Town of Framingham
Annual Report
public input for the Master Plan. The
Master Plan is anticipated to be presented
at the fall 2011 Town Meeting.
Comprehensive Improvement Plan for
the Framingham Technology Park
The Board, as a condition of their site
plan approval for Genzyme's Biologics
Support Center and with the agreement of
Genzyme Corporation, initiated a
planning process to develop a
comprehensive improvement plan for the
Framingham Technology Park. The
Board engaged Terra Tech Rizzo to
provide develop the plan. The planning
process is a collaborative effort between
town officials and park owners and
tenants.
The plan evaluates the sufficiency of
current infrastructure to meet the
forecasted development needs and will
explore options for substantially
upgrading the appearance of the Park in a
comprehensive and cohesive manner.
The plan will, in a specific way, provide an
overall vision for the Framingham
Technology Park and define expectations
related to streetscape elements such as
lighting, signage, pedestrian
accommodations and landscaping so that
as the Park is upgraded through public
grants or private initiatives it is done in a
manner consistent with a documented
plan. The plan address broader issues
related to transportation and utility
infrastructure and emergency services in a
more general way, focusing on identifying
current and future system deficiencies and
potential solutions. The draft plan was
issued in 2010 and the final plan is
expected to be completed before the end
of the calendar year. 
2010
ADMINISTRATION
The Board has continued to work with
the Town Treasurer's Office to require
prospective developers to obtain
certification from the Town's
Treasurer /Tax Collector that no local
taxes, fees, assessments or other municipal
charges are outstanding prior to
submission ofan application. As a result
of this process, many applicants have been
obligated to bring unsettled accounts up
to date before the Board would consider
theirdevelopment proposals. Since first
employed in May of 1993, this noteworthy
process has been a source of substantial
uncollected taxes for the Town. By the
end of calendar year 2010, $2,388.268,07
had been collected to date.
The Board continues to improve the
website to increase availability of the
information to the public. The Zoning
By -Law and Subdivision Regulations are
available for downloading and printing to
make the document more widely available
tothe public. The Board continues to
post on the website zoning amendments,
which are current through Annual Town
Meeting 2010, weekly agendas and
approved minutes. Submissions forlarger
projects review are available on the
Board's website. A specific MasterPlan
webpage is also available, which provides
citizens the ability to keep updated on the
status of the Plan, find out where and
when public participation sessions will
occur and be able to provide comments or
questions from this page. Awebpage is
also available for the Comprehensive
Infrastructure Improvement Plan for the
Framingham Technology Park.
Once projects are approved, the Board
also ensures that they conform to the
conditions of approval by conducting
Planning & Economic Development  134
Page 146
Town of Framingham
Annual Report
conformance reviews during the
permitting and construction phases for
approved projects.
In calendar year 2010, the Board collected
a total of $16,20551.in revenue from
associated project review fees and from
the sale of Zoning By -Laws, Zoning
Maps, Subdivision Rules and Regulations,
andminormiscellaneousrevenues. The
projects reviewed by the Board will create
hundreds ofconstruction jobs. The
Board secured through the development
review process off -site mitigation
infrastructure improvements valued at
2,000. 910, Upon occupancy of these
projects, the net increase in positive tax
flow over a five year period to be realized 
2010
by the Town is expected to be
7,000.298,00.
In addition to these contributions to the
General Fund, the Planning Board obtains
significant Town -wide amenities through
the process ofnegotiated mitigation. In
the course of its review the Planning
Board requires applicants to provide
improvements such as roadway widening
and reconstruction, signalization,
enhancements for public transportation
and landscaping to offset adverse project
impacts. In calendaryear 2010 the Board
received $74,00000.in direct mitigation
performance guarantees and payments.

The MetroWest RTA was created by a
vote of the Framingham and the Ashland
Boards of Selectman in December of
2006. By the summer of 2007, seven
additional communities had joined, a
budget and fares were put in place, and an
Administrator was hired to oversee the
daily operation of the LIFT which had
been under the Framingham Planning
Department. MWRTA "  fixed route"
service was then initiated on December
1s`,2007 with a new contracted provider
and 10 new buses obtained from Federal
and State grants. At the same time, the
MWRTA was paying the MBTA to 
continue its RIDE service in the
Framingham and Natick area.
In 2008, the original Framingham LIFT
and the Natick Neighborhood bus routes
were integrated into a unified transit
system. That year, Marlborough and
Southborough joined MWRTA,
expanding demand response service
delivery by 2,000 rides a month.
In 2009, the Authority, through a Federal
grant, expanded again to create a link to
the Woodland MBTA Station in Newton
Route #1) setting the stage for using the
Charlie Card system wide. Additionally,
the Authority took over the MBTA's
RIDE provision in Framingham and
Planning & Economic Development  136
Page 148
Town of Framingham
Annual Report
Natick expanding again the demand
response provision by another 5,000 rides
a month.
In 2010, the Authority, using state and
federal funds, purchased and rehabilitated
a facility at 37 Waverly St. which will serve
as the "Hub" and maintenance depot for
the system.
Growth of the system is supported by a
staff dedicated to personal, friendly and
helpful service to every customer. This
focus on customer service has been
augmented by the Authority's leadership
in the use of technology to provide
reliability and convenience.
Route #1, as mentioned above, is
MetroWest's link to the MBTA's Green
Line. Routes #2 and #3, which loop
entirely within Framingham, are the most
highly traveled routes; consistently
averaging over 4,000 rides a month. Route
4 connects Market Basket to the 
2010
Shopper's World /Mall area and provides
service to the Beaver Street
neighborhood. Route # 5 connects
Framingham to Hopkinton, Route 6
connects Framingham to Holliston, and
Route #7, which also consistently
averages over 4,000 rides a month,
connects Framingham to Southborough
and Marlborough. Route #9 is a
component of Route #1 during the
commuter hours and runs exclusively on
Route 9 during the off commute hours.
The MWRTA will continue to build upon
the over 400,000 rides provided in FY10
by using technology, an emphasis on
customer service and the more effective
and efficient delivery of transportation
service. For further details and for real

Parks and Recreation Commission
Barry Bograd served as chairman with other
members Robert Brown, Dan Jones Joan
Rastani and Kevin Salvi.
The Annual Town Meeting voted for an
annual operating budget of $2,523179, for
Parks Administration, Maintenance and
Recreation. This was a 3% reduction of a
level funded budget which resulted in the
decrease of $ 81,000 in the Maintenance
Budget and $42,000 in the Recreation Budget.
Particularly hit hard were the summer special
needs camps that were forced to reduce the
number of weeks, increase fees, and reduce
overall services including transportation.
The Department was proud to re open the
Bowditch Field Athletic and Cultural
Complex that was renovated via a 2007 Town
Meeting appropriation. The new state of the
art facility includes seating for 5100 people, a
handicapped accessible press box, home and
away locker rooms and bathrooms that are
highlighted with decorative block wall
construction. There is also an improved image
to the streetscape along Union Avenue. The
unique design of three historical walls inside
the plaza contains interpretive signage and
Recreation & Cultural Affairs 
captures the history of the property. The
project was 
finished on time and under
budget.
Due to the construction at Bowditch Field,
the ever popular Wednesday night Track
program was held at Framingham State
College. In addition, the traditional
Framingham High School Graduation was re-
located to the beautiful Cushing Memorial
Park.
A grant through Parkland Acquisition and
Renovations for Communities (PARC) in the
amount of $279,000 was used to complete the
fourth phase of Cushing Memorial Park.
Argus Construction was awarded the contract
and implemented many park improvements
designed by Weston and Sampson
Engineering. A main promenade, pergola
seating area, a new pedestrian entrance from
Winter Street and additional tree plantings are
some of the parks new attributes.
Capital funding included a new Bobcat Skid
Steer to be used for the daily maintenance of
the parks, Furber Playground improvements
scheduled for late 2011, and computerized
irrigation throughout the parks predicted to
save both money and water for the Town.
Farm Pond Park was improved with a new
handicapped accessible playground with
monies provided by the Disabilities
Commission; the new play structure is
scheduled to open in 2011. Other alternative
resources included Community Development
Block Grant money to build an additional
parking area at the new and improved
Butterworth Park, and monies from the
139

Metropolitan Area Planning Council " Bike
Rack Grant" which supplied 43 bike racks in
16 locations throughout the Town.
The Department continues to do the best they
canwiththeresources theyaregiven. Itisa
goal of all Divisions to seek and provide a
high standard to the quality of life for the
residents of the Town.
We would like to thank Town Meeting, the
many Town boards, committees, departments
and volunteers for supporting our services.
We would also like to thank the hundreds of
user organizations for their continued
support.

The highlight of 2010 was 
the Grand
Opening Celebration of the Bowditch Field
Athletic and Cultural Complex. This 3 -day
community event was held on Columbus
Day weekend. Events included a Walk for
Health Relay, the Framingham High School
Flyers football game vs. Norwood, an all day
cultural exposition included artisans, food
vendors, and musicians featuring Arlo
Guthrie as the headliner. The event closed on
Monday with many of the Framingham youth
sports groups playing inthenew stadium. We
thank our many sponsors and volunteers, in
particular the Metro West Medical Center and
the Framingham Cooperative Bank, for the
success of the weekend.
The three town beaches saw one of the
highestattendance records in years. The near
perfect weather brought over 13,000 visitors
during the eight week season.
New programs included an over 40 Men's
Basketball League, additional preschool
classes, and Adult Tai Chi.
Recreation & Cultural Affairs 
2010 Annual Report
The new Park &  Rec Update Cable show
hosted by Barry Bograd featured many of the
department's programs.
Once again we are thankful to the many
successful grants that enhanced our 2010
programs. The Department of Public Health
and the State of Massachusetts provided
funding for continued Youth at Risk
programming. Future Skill funded two
summer counselors for our Recreation
Centers and Project Bread and the United
States Department of Agriculture Food and
Nutrition Service provided equipment and
free breakfast and lunch for the Recreation
Special Needs Program.
The 215 member Framingham Swim Team
coached by Joey Sementelli and assisted by
Kristen Shippee, Aubrey Courville, Keith
Savran, and Chris Peterson had a record of 9
1  this summer. The loss was their first in
three years as the team placed 2nd to Newton;
however, FST won the mile swim again this
year. Unfortunately, Joey is  leaving the
department to pursue his education goals. His
enthusiasm and dedication will be difficult to
replace.
The PAL basketball league led by Director,
Tom Click, once again challenged the New
England Patriots Kevin Faulk, Darius Butlers
and Pierre Woods in an exciting game of
Basketball with the win going to the young
PAL league.
The department, assisted by the Friends of
Framingham Recreation, sponsored the
following special events this year; 
The
Bowditch Grand Opening, a Brazilian Masters
Soccer Game, Pumpkins in the Park, the 911
Remembrance Ceremony and the bi- annual
Thanksgiving Bonfire (highlighting Selectmen
Dennis Giombetti as the honorary " Fire
Starter" and assisted by other members of his
Board)
Other memorable events included Fox 25
Morning News crew broadcasting their Zip

Also, the Opening Ceremonies for the Susan
Koman 3 Day Cancer Walk was held at Farm
Pond.
We would like to thank the Town Selectmen,
Town Meeting Members, Town Staff, and
numerous community volunteers for their
constant support and dedication. Without
your endless continued support, we would not
be successful in offering our quality programs
to the residents of Framingham.

Parks Maintenance
The Parks Maintenance Division provides
safe and well maintained facilities for over
14,700 formally scheduled events each year
through our pro- active management plans.
Our user groups have become accustomed to
ahighlevel ofqualityin ourfacilities. Using
this pro- active approach enables us to
coordinate the use of labor, materials, and
equipment to provide a cost effective sports
turf maintenance program for this
department.
Through this maintenance program we have
been able to maintain the great condition of
our high use turf areas. Our program
continues to use a 
balanced system of
aeration, fertilization, seeding, mowing, with
proper irrigation in the most cost effective
manner. We continue to monitor our soil
conditions and provide the necessary nutrient
applications as needed. This has benefited all
of our high use turf areas.
We continue to be asked to provide additional
practice and game field facilities. The demand
is constant and there are few alternatives to
turn to. Over use of facilities and the decline
in turf quality is still a major problem and
concern for us. The strategy of field rotation
and limiting use has worked in the past, but
once again we are being challenged for not
Recreation & Cultural Affairs 
2010 Annual Report
having enough space for all our groups. We
are still seeing a  growing increase in
participation of some of the seasonal sports.
We have had to look at ways to change how
and where some of the nontraditional user
groups are being scheduled. There is a definite
need to look at some long range plans for
future field space. Until this happens we will
continue to be asked to provide more use on
areas that are already seeing heavy use. As we
have noted in the past, this overuse
accelerates the need to shut down fields for
costly renovations.
The second phase of field renovations at
Fuller Field was 
completed in the early
summer. This included stripping out the old
asphalt basketball courts, grading, installation
of additional irrigation lines re- grading with
added excess material from the Bowditch
Field project, then fertilizing/ seeding. This
project was accomplished with town and
contracted resources. By completing this
phase we will increase the size of this athletic
area to allow more activity and the ability for
further field rotation. We hope to have this
section of the field usable by the fall of 2011
Our Maintenance Department continues to
provide support to the athletic programs of
three high schools, Framingham High, Marian
High and Keefe Vocational High School.
Other schools that rely on our department for
a portion of their athletic program needs are,
Framingham State University and Mass. Bay
CommunityCollege. In addition to school
athletics, the Department provides scheduling
and facilities for hundreds of other user
groups from the Framingham Community.
Our working relationship with Keefe
Technical School continues to enable our
department to complete some major projects.
The plumbing lab installed new pneumatic air
lines in the new M/O buildings. The metals
lab built a portable work station. The electrical
lab provided labor to begin the initial stages
for the Butterworth Tennis Light Project.
This is a CDBG project that has been divided
141
Page 153
Town of Framingham
into two projects one for infrastructure and a
second phase to relight the tennis courts. This
mutually beneficial relationship provides the
Town of Framingham with access to cost
effective, professionally supervised, electrical,
carpentry, plumbing, and metal fabrication,
while affording students the benefit of
practical "real world" learning experiences in a
commercial setting.
The Butterworth Park improvements that our
staff had begun the previous year continued
this past year. With CDBG funding, we have
established a new parking area inside of the
park and ground and regraded the old
roadway. Weareplanningonpavingthe
parking area this spring.
Through our Capital Budget program we were
able to purchase a skid steer loader with some
turf construction attachments.
One of the attachments is a  snow blower
which as useful in clearing the sidewalks at
Bowditch Field after the heavy snow storms
this past winter. This type of equipment will
enable us to successfully carry out turf type
construction projects. We are currently
working on finalizing the completion of the
Bowditch Field Grandstand/ Stadium project.
There is still a small punch list of work that
will need to be finished as we come into the
spring. The successful completion of this
project was captured in the October grand
opening celebration.
Our other Capital projects are in the final
stages of planning. The computerization of
our irrigations systems should be completed
by early summer; and we hope to have a
handicap accessible play area at Furber Park
completed.
Our tree maintenance program continues at a
much smaller scale. We will continue our
removal program, concentrating on hazardous
trees and trees with obvious structural defects.
We are hoping we can keep up with this
program in some form in the future. The
Town wide beautification program we have
Recreation & Cultural Affairs 
2010 Annual Report
been following continues to be a successful
collaboration with our department and
outside groups willing to make donations to
upgrade and beautify road side areas with the
ability to advertise their donations.
I would like to thank all our volunteers and
volunteer groups that supplied us with help
on projects this past year. Their support was
tremendous.
We continue to give support and resources to
other Town departments including the School
Department, Building Services, Public Works
and Conservation. We would like to thank all
of the Town departments for the cooperation
they have provided throughout theyear. It
would be very difficult for us to achieve the
success we have without their help.

Loring Skating Arena
Loring Arena
Loring Arena is in its 48` year of operation.
In addition to our normal services, we are
continuing to create a user -friendly
atmosphere.
The Loring Arena Committee members are
appointed as an advisory board. The
members appointed by the Board of
Selectmen this year were co- chairs
Joe Tersom and David Friday, and
John Hart, Jack Jagher, Bob Brown,
Richard Callahan and Joan Rastani.
Significant upgrades were made to the cooling
system of the Arena including a  2nd new
electric motor to replace the 30 year old
motor. A new " bull's eye" column was
installed on the chiller, with new oil drains, to
maximize the efficiency. Savings to the Town
are approximately 2000kwh. American
Refrigeration replaced a section of perimeter
piping on the main supply line, which was
Recreation & Cultural Affairs 
2010 Annual Report
showing significant corrosion. The Loring
Arena staff drained and reinstalled
approximately 1,500 gallons of glycol from
the piping, saving approximately $2,000.
A lightning storm hit the power line poles
during the summer of 2010 resulting in a
poweroutage forthe entire arena. The entire
600 amp electrical panel was replaced. Two of
the original entrance doors from 1963 were
replaced by new insulated, energy efficient
and up to code doors which were installed by
New England School Services.
Infrared heat was installed to the spectator
areas. Patrons can access the middle sections
of the heat by a coin operated system, with
controls and overrides located in the main
office. We have had nothing but rave reviews
from patrons for the heated sections in the
spectator seating. This $100,000 project was
completed with a  contribution from the
Framingham Co- operative Bank and a
48,000 rebate from NStar for a total project
cost to the taxpayers of less than $45,000.
The Loring Arena Legacy Foundation raised
7,037 to defer the cost of replacing the 30
year old sound system. The new sound
system was installed by Muzak and included
12 new speakers, 1000watt power amp, IPod
dock, CD player, wireless microphone, 2
remote controllers ( office & timekeepers box),
and satellite music for public skating.
A new 42" LCD monitor was installed in the
arena lobby for all patrons to see when
entering the building. Information on Parks
Recreation services, arena schedules, arena
updates and town information is continually
displayed on thismonitor. Free Wi -Fi was
also added to the arena, which has been much
appreciated by patrons and parents using the
facility.

School Committee
Budget
While the state and federal economy showed
some signs of improvement, the public sector
experienced a challenging fiscal climate due to
the end of the federal stimulus programs
designed to lessen the impact of the recession
in its earlydays. SchoolCommitteebudget
discussions centered on the question: How
can we provide the best possible education
for all our students within available funding?
Given projected revenues, expected levels of
state and federal funding and increased
expenses, the School Committee determined
that a level service budget was not feasible.
As the FYI budget deliberation began, a
budget gap of approximately $10.3 million
existed between the School Committee' s
initial budget and the Town's projected
budget appropriation to the schools.
On May 18, 2010 School Committee Chair
Michael Bower and member David Miles
announced that an agreement had been
reached with the Framingham Teachers
Association for concessions amounting to
over $600,000 in savings or nearly 1.2% of
salary. The savings allowed the School
Committee to avoid having to consider school
closings at a  critical point in the budget
development process.
In late May 2010, Town Meeting approved an
FYI budget appropriation of $88,969,695,
which included a  one -time allocation of
400,000 from the incremental increase in
FY11 Local Meals and Room Tax receipts.
To balance the FY11 budget, the School
Committee cut more than 50 positions; class
sizes increased; and class offerings were
reduced. Support personnel and specialty 
programs that have benefited so many
students over the years were significantly
reduced or eliminated altogether.
In addition, the School Committee scaled
back school transportation services and
expanded student- walking distances with a
plan to provide transportation to Grades K -6
students who live 2 miles or more from
school who by state statute are eligible for
busing at no charge. Grades 7 -12 students
who lived 2 miles or more from school would
continue to be bused for a $270 fee per
student per year with an annual family cap of
540. The decision resulted in areduction of
10 school buses and drivers and savings of
500,000.
As the 2010/2011 school year began, it
became clear to the School Committee that its
transportation plan was not sustainable
because it did not meet the needs of school
families. In September, the School Committee
decided to offer a limited, fee -based busing
option for families who lived within the 2-
mile parameters. It was agreed that any
additional buses provided should be revenue
neutral because there were no operating funds
available to pay for the program.
Hundreds of families who lived within the 2
mile state standard applied for and received
school bus transportation for a fee of $270
per year with an annual family cap of $540.
By early November, the district met its goal to
provide bus transportation to previously
ineligible students.
Consolidation of School and Town Payroll
Function
On May 12, 2010, the School Committee
Education & Libraries  147
Page 159
Town of Framingham
voted, pursuant to Massachusetts General
Laws c.71 Section 37M, to consolidate the
School and Town payroll function so that the
processing function is absorbed within the
Town' s Finance Division under the
supervision oftheTownAccountant. Upon
Town Meeting vote, the consolidation plan
became effective July 1, 2010.
The School Committee is  committed to
working with the Board of Selectman and
Town Meeting in  evaluating future
consolidation opportunities with the goal of
efficiency being preeminent.
The Laramie Project
On Friday December 3rd and Saturday
December 4` the Framingham Drama
Company and nearly 30 adult members of the
community performed a spellbinding
rendition of The Laramie Project before
standing room only crowds at Framingham
High School. Underthe guidance and
direction of Donna Wresinski the cast
recounted the events leading up to and
following the brutal murder of gay college
student Matthew Shepard in Laramie
Wyoming in October 1998. This
controversial play written by Moises Kaufman
sparked a community wide dialogue on
tolerance, acceptance, and the need to address
the many forms of bullying faced by so many
young people, particularly those in the lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender ( LGBT)
community.
Donna Wresinski summed it up best when
she said " The Laramie Project, along with
The Framingham Project — A Love is Louder
Campaign' allows us to look at our own
community and to articulate who we want to
be as a community without having to live
through the pain and anguish so many people
inLaramie survived. Through this play and
the events of the last month, we can say with
pride that we are not afraid to look at our
community and say we have HOPE; HOPE
for the present through the community
members who chose to get involved by
Education & Libraries 
2010 Annual Report
participating or supporting the play, HOPE
for the future through these talented high
school students, and HOPE for the power of
the Arts in our schools and community.
Thank you for being the brave and committed
community of Framingham. Iamproudto
call it my home."
Preceding the Saturday December 4, 2010
performance there was a candlelight vigil on
the steps of Framingham High School in
supportoftolerance andacceptance. Many
community leaders participated in the vigil
including State Representatives Pam
Richardson and Tom Sannicandro, State
Representative -elect Chris Walsh, Selectmen
Dennis Giombetti and Laurie Lee, Town
Clerk Valerie Mulvey, School Committee
Members Michael Bower, Adam Blumer,
David Miles, Richard Finlay and Carol Phalen
and Finance Committee Member Betty Funk.
Town /School Budget Summit
In December, the Board of Selectmen hosted
a Town /School FY12 Budget Summit. Town
and School officials heard CFO Mary Ellen
Kelley's FY12 revenue projection. Town and
School officials plan to reconvene in March or
Anil 2011, when the state budget figures are
available. Superintendent Hiersche
summarized School Committee concerns for
the future including (1) maintaining the quality
of education expected in Framingham; (2) the
ability to attract and retain talented
professionals; (3) the ability to build a 21s`
Century school system; and (4) ever increasing
fees for families.
A Commitment to Public Information and
Transparency
In 2010, the School Committee continued its
on- going, long -term commitment to
providing public information in as transparent
a means as possible by expanding the use of
the district web -site, standardizing a variety of
financial documents reviewed at Finance
Subcommittee meetings, developing grant
reporting tools as suggested by the Town
Finance Committee, and including public
148
Page 160
Town of Framingham
participation in the school bus bid
specification process.
During 2010, the School Committee
significantly expanded the documentation
posted onthe FPSwebsite. The School
Committee page now includes a new
Financial and District Data" tab that
contains budget materials and presentations
dating back to FY06; current in -force school
union contracts; enrollment statistics since
school year 2007, an English Language
Learner (ELL) Report; a Special Education
Report; the 10 -year Facilities Plan, and the
FY12 Capital Budget requests. While all of
this information was publicly available in the
past, this consolidation of information on the
website significantly improves its accessibility
for the public.
The Finance Subcommittee of the School
Committee meets in open session on a
monthly basis to review various financial
reports routinely generated by school staff
and in some cases those requested by the
TownFinanceCommittee. School
Committee member Adam Blumer has
provided outstanding leadership as Convener
of the Finance Subcommittee for the past two
years. Members David Miles andRichard
Finlay have contributed enormously to the
efforts of the Finance Subcommittee bringing
to the table many years of School Committee
andTown Meeting experience. TheSchool
Committee expresses its sincere thanks to
Business Operations Director Ed Gotgart and
School Accountant Melissa Dunnet for their
expertise in providing these materials to us in
an easy, understandable format.
In October, the Administration convened a
School Bus Bid Specification Working Group
which included representation from the Town
and the community with a goal to develop
competitive bid specifications for FPS busing
services that would increase the attractiveness
of the bid and result in more qualified bidders.
The School Committee supported the
Administration' s efforts to ensure full
Education & Libraries 
2010 Annual Report
transparency for the district's school bus bid
process, and the success of this effort was
manifested in the receipt of three bids from
qualified vendors.
The School Committee remains committed to
continuously and aggressively broaden the
public's access to information through the use
of ever evolving technologies and
communication mechanisms. As always, we
remain committed to consider suggestions
from the public relative to this matter.
Policy
In 2010, the School Committee embarked on
a comprehensive review of its Policy Manual
workingtogetherwith the MASC. The goal
of this project is to update policies to reflect
current practice, statutory requirements and
contractual language; to remove obsolete
policies and ultimately to prepare the district's
policy manual for on -line presentation and
availability.
The Policy Subcommittee has worked
tirelessly onthisreview. Convener Andy
Limeri and members Beverly Hugo and Carol
Phalen are to be thanked for their efforts on
this project. School Committee
Administrative Assistant Ann Greenberg has
greatly assisted in this work providing an
historical perspective for many district policies
gained during her more than 15 years of
service to the school system.
The Committee
In April 2010, incumbents Adam Blumer and
Ricky Finlay were re- elected to three -year
terms. Carol Phalen was re- elected to a one -
year term expiring in April 2011. After the
election, the Committee reconvened to elect
Michael Bower as Chair, Beverly Hugo as
Vice Chair and Richard Finlay as Clerk.
In closing, the School Committee would like
to thank the district teachers, staff and
administration, who despite severe budget
constraints continue to improve the quality of
education forallofourstudents. Wewould
also like to thank the citizens of Framingham
149

The College Board's Advance Placement
Program (AP) offers students the opportunity
to take challenging, college -level courses while
still in high school and to receive college
credit, advanced placement, or both for
successful performance on the AP Exams.
Since 2002, the number of students taking the
AP exams has more than doubled with three
hundred and forty participating in 684
Advanced Placement Exams, in eighteen
subjects, in 2010. 84% of the exams were
passed and eligible for college credit. This
compares with three hundred sixty three who
took the exam in twenty -two subjects in
2009.
Through continuing aggressive efforts of the
FHS Guidance Department, 89% of the
junior class and 89% of the sophomore class
took the Preliminary Scholastic Assessment
Test (PSAT). These numbers are impressive
compared to the fact that 65% of the junior
class and 46% of the sophomore class took
the test in 2004. Over 76% of the graduating
class participated inthe SAT. Framingham
students averaged 511 on the Critical Reading
portion, 547 in the Mathematics portion, and
509 on the Writing Component. These scores
compare well with National Averages which
are 501, 516 and 492 respectively.
The community should be proud that so
many students take and pass a wide variety of
Education & Libraries 
2010 Annual Report
these college -level exams, and that they do so
well. One result of the high student
achievement is acceptance at a college or
university to continue education. In keeping
with past years, more than 88% of the
graduates in the Class of 2010 continued their
education at an impressive variety of
institutions of higher learning, including some
of the most selective colleges in the country.
The Fine Arts program in Framingham
schools continues to produce award winning
events. Afewexamplesoftheir
accomplishments are: Framingham High
School students took home twenty -four
awards in the Boston Globe Scholastic Art
competition. In August, the High School
Drama Company represented the United
States at the Fringe Festival in Scotland. They
were chosen from a group 2000 entries and
were also State Finalists in the Massachusetts
HighSchoolDramaGuildCompetition. In
addition, they were the winner of the
Sherwood Collins State Playwriting Award,
which is a student written one -act play writing
competition. Fiveseniors intheDrama
Company placed in the Massachusetts
Educational Guild Scholarship auditions.
Cameron Middle School had ten students who
received honorable mention awards at the
Boston Globe Scholastic Art Contest and
twenty- six Framingham High School students
received awards as well. Five students, who
won Gold Key Awards, will have their
worked judged in the National Competition.
Town Meeting appropriated funds to achieve
a balanced budget for FYI1. The School
Department is appreciative of the Town's
financial support to provide its children with a
quality education they deserve.
Throughout the year, working with the
Structural Deficit Committee, comprised of
members from the Finance Committee, Board
of Selectmen and School Committee as well
as the Town Manager, CFO, School Business
Administration Director and the
Superintendent of Schools, and through
150

Subjects. PartofourRacetotheTop
proposal includes aligning our curriculum to
these newstandards. The alignmentprocess
will focus on developing curriculum maps and
assessments that will guide teachers in the
instruction they deliver.
District literacy work over the past year
includes phasing in Measures of Academic
Progress (MAP),a nationally normed reading,
math and language usage assessment that
monitors student growth. The information
MAP provides will be used to target
additional reading instruction for struggling
readers as well as enrichment for advanced
readers. Students taketheMAPassessment

Technology integration into curriculum has
been a 
priority. Themiddleschoolliteracy
specialists are piloting Expert 21, an on -line
English language arts curriculum. Other
middle school staffs are investigating Expert
Space, a website for social studies and science
teachers to access materials that improve
lesson design. As the district plans a three -tier
approach to reading instruction, programs
such as Lexia, an on -line reading support
program, are being phased in for elementary
andmiddleschoolstudents. High school
teachers are able to offer blended courses,
part on -line and part face -to -face through a
course taken at Northeastern as part of a

grant that included technology hardware for
the Thayer Campus.
Administrators have been involved in learning

instruction in elementary and middle school
classrooms. Ourpartners inthis efforthave
been Dr. Julie Meltzer, an adolescent literacy
expert, and Mary Canner, a former elementary
principal, who is a consultant for Teachers 21.
The exchange of observations and notes when
completing classroom walk -throughs has
informed the decisions made regarding
improvements in instruction.
Whether it is the innovation schools initiative
at Woodrow Wilson or the work on the multi-
media guide for comprehensive literacy, the
staff have been enthusiastic, energetic, and
engaged in efforts to improve student
achievement. The district has supported
efforts to become a  professional learning
community that makes positive incremental
change through reflection and discourse.

School Health Services (  SHS) provides
comprehensive nursing care to the students of
Framingham Public Schools. Nurse staffing
includes ( in spite of the elimination of one
nurse position last year) one full time nurse in
each school, two nurses at the high school,
and two adolescent health nurses.
This year SHS again benefits from the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health
Essential School Health Services ( ESHS)
program. In spite of a 9% reduction in
funding, ESHS monies continue to strengthen
SHS infrastructure with personnel,
professional development opportunities, and
equipment, including technology.
In Fall 2010, medication and independent
nurse polices were reviewed, brought into
compliance with Massachusetts regulations,
and approved by School Committee.
Currently, SHS is  assisting with the
development of the district' s new state -
mandated concussion policy and protocol.

Title I
Title I  is a federally funded program that
provides financial resources to districts and
schools with a higher percentage of students
from low- income families. All six of our Title
I  schools — Barbieri, Brophy, McCarthy and
Woodrow Wilson Elementary Schools, and
Cameron and Fuller Middle Schools — have
schoolwide programs ". 
This means that all
students in the school are eligible to receive
support through the Tide I program.
Education & Libraries 
2010 Annual Report
At the state level, the focus of Title I  has
shifted from one of compliance to one of
support. While we still closely follow the
regulations at the federal and state levels, the
priority is  to support overall school
improvement initiatives. In Framingham, the
Title I program has made a similar shift.
We continue to provide interventionists in the
Title I schools who support the district goal
of ensuring that all students make at least one
year's growth in literacy and mathematics. In
addition, math coaches provide support to
classroom teachers to help them support the
mathematics achievement of those students
most at risk of not meeting the state's high
academic standards. Finally, the Data
Coaching initiative started in the 2009 -2010
school year has been continued and expanded
for the 2010 -2011 school year. Through this
initiative, teachers work in collaborative
groups to review student data and use it to
guide instructional decisions. Combined with
Title IIA funds, data teams are being formed
in all schools.
Our parent involvement activities continue to
support each school's improvement goals.
Our goal is to provide parents and other
caregivers with the tools they need in order to
partner effectively with their child's school in
order to  promote strong academic
achievement. We have offered workshops on
the new math program, Think Math, so that
parents are better able to understand the
homework children receive. Similarly, we have
provided workshops about summer
opportunities for students and ways parents
can support continued learning in the summer
months. In this way, parents and caregivers
remain an integral component of school
improvement initiatives.
The Title I program continues to be excited
about the support it is able to provide to
students, families, and the general school
community.

Adult ESL Plus
Framingham Adult ESL Plus enrolled 620
students in each of two semesters for 2010.
Students came from 32 countries and spoke
15 different languages. Theyrangedinage
from 18 to 85. Students attended a.m. or p.m.
English as Second Language classes, Adult
Basic Education classes, GED preparation
classes, or Citizenship Preparation classes. All
were eager to improve their English skills and
in doing so become better integrated into the
Framingham community.
Thirty students graduated from the program's
highest level and eight students received their
GED after successfully passing the GED
examination. Attendance for the year was
excellent with over 80% of enrolled students
completing each semester.
Highlights of 2010 include:
A presentation for advanced students by
the MIRA Coalition.
A supplemental writing class for GED
students to help prepare them for next steps
in their education.
Presentations from a  physician at The
Kennedy Health Center regarding healthy
lifestyles.
Class visits to The Danforth Museum, The
Framingham History Center, The State
House, and The Framingham Public Library.
The effectiveness of  educational
programming at Framingham Adult ESL Plus
is measured by Performance Standards for
Adult Education Programs issued by The
Massachusetts Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education (  formerly the
Department of Education). These standards
include:
Attendance -  Programs ensure that students
attend between 66% and 76% of planned
student hours. Framingham Adult ESL Plus
achieved an attendance rate of 87 %.  Pre and
Post Test Percentage -  Programs ensure that
between 66% and 76% of eligible students are
pre and post tested using the DESE's
Education & Libraries 
2010 Annual Report
approved assessment tools. Framingham
Adult ESL Plus pre and post- tested 83% of
students. Learner Gains -  Programs ensure
that between 35% and 49% of students
demonstrate gain as defined for each
approved assessment. 40% of students at
Framingham Adult ESL Plus made
measurable gains. Setting and Meeting Goals -
Programs set on average at least 2 goals per
student per year and programs meet on
average at least one goal peryear. Students at
Framingham Adult ESL Plus set on average
4.6 goals per year and met 3.4 goals per year.
Another indication of program effectiveness
is increased student involvement in the area's
economy, schools, and greater community.
Students report joining school parent
organizations, becoming more active in youth
groups, getting jobs, attending training
programs, and starting businesses.
Framingham Adult ESL Plus also has an
active volunteer component through which
some of the hundreds of wait -listed students
can receive 2 hours a week of tutoring. At
present 8 of the over 30 volunteers are former
students in theprogram. Theyhave decided
to "give back" to the program that helped
them so much.
On March 22, 2010 The MetroWest Adult
ESL Fundraising Committee hosted a
successful gala to support Framingham Adult
ESL Plus. This annual event, spearheaded by
many area businesses, raises funds to support
6 classes each year. The support ofthe local
business community as well as many agencies
and individuals is of tremendous importance,
especially in helping to address the ongoing
waiting list of over 500 eager students.
Framingham Adult ESL Plus has
demonstrated tremendous growth since it's
inception by a  group of town meeting
members in1984. Framingham Adult ESL
Plus is fortunate to be in a school system and
a community which values life long learning
and appreciates the diversity of its residents.
We look forward to continuing to give back
156

to the community, which has been so
supportive.

Special Education Program
The Department of Special Education
provides a broad array of services for children
and youth identified with disabilities from the
ages 
of three through twenty -two. The
referral, evaluation and placement procedures
are governed by state and federal special
education laws and regulations, namely, The
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
IDEA).FPS is committed to the goal of
providing an appropriate education for
students with special needs in the least
restrictive setting.
The following programs and services were
offered by FPS from Pre -School to High
School: Special Education Resource Rooms
are available in eachschool. TheResource
Room or Learning Center model provides
direct teaching in both special and regular
class settings, through inclusion, supportive
teaching and /or consultation to the regular
classroom teacher of identified children.
There are fifty -eight Substantially Separate
classes from Pre -School through High School.
These students require comprehensive
programming which is provided outside of
the regular education classroom for more than
60% of the school day. These classes are
located at the High School, three Middle
Schools, at seven Elementary Schools, and at
the Pre -School serving the special education
needs of students throughout the District.
Where appropriate, these students are
included in general education classes and
ancillary activities.
Related services, namely speech /language
therapy, occupational therapy, physical
therapy, adaptive physical education and
services from the teachers of the visually
impaired, orientation &  mobility specialist and
consulting audiologist may be included in a
Education & Libraries 
2010 Annual Report
student's Individualized Education Plan (IEP)
and are provided by itinerant personnel at all
schools. Inclusion programs 
havebeen
established using a  variety of approaches
throughout the district. Some classes are
team -taught, some classes meet for specific
periods, and some special education teachers
are assigned to a group of classes. In addition,
some teachers who are dually certified in
special education and regular education have
full time responsibility for inclusion classes at
the elementary level.
Framingham is  a  model for Pre - School
Programs for both children with special needs
and typical children ages three to five. The
placement of children with special needs in
the Pre -School Programs emphasizes
language, communication and social skills
development. The majority of children with
special needs in the BLOCKS Pre -School
Program are integrated throughout their
school day with children without special
needs.
Framingham continues to see a  significant
increase in the number of children with
autism, with multiple disabilities and medical
needs, with significant social/ emotional
disabilities, particularly at the Pre -School and
Elementary level. The severity of these
disabilities presents challenges to the school
district to develop new and additional
programs in order to maintain these children
in the public schools.
In conclusion, Framingham has continued to
implement and provide a  comprehensive
continuum of programs, services, and
placement options for students with
disabilities. Framingham is fortunate to have
an active Special Education Parent Advisory
Council whose role is to advise the special
education department and to engage parents
of children with disabilities in the schools
through meetings and town wide newsletters.

Bilingual Education Programs
The Department of Bilingual Education
provides support and services to students in
grades K -12 whose primary language is other
than English. Thisstudentgroupisoften
referred to as English language learners ( ELL)
and the primary goal of all bilingual
programming is  to provide specialized
instruction in English language development
to enable ELLs to access the curriculum and
achieve in an English dominant environment.
Bilingual education is an umbrella term which
encompasses a variety of different types of
program models. In Framingham, such
models range 
from Sheltered English
Immersion to Two -Way, to Transitional
Bilingual Education, and include variations on
eachoftheseprograms. In 2010, 16.6% of
the district K -12 enrollment was identified as
limited English proficient or ELL and FPS
offered specific programming and support at
eight different schools: five elementary
schools, Barbieri, Brophy, Dunning, Potter
Road, and Wilson; 2 middle schools, Walsh
and Fuller; and at Framingham High School.
Due to the dedication of the staff and success
of programming, FPS continues to be
recognized as an educational leader in
bilingual education. One of the external
indicators of success is an accountability
report published by the Department of
Elementary and Secondary Education on each
Title III school district's progress toward
attaining Annual Measurable Achievement
Objectives. Once again, FPS has met the
state set goals for attainment and for progress
relative to English language acquisition for
ELL students. This is  a 
tremendous
accomplishment and accurately reflects the
high quality of teachers, programs, and
services provided at all of our schools.
This year the office of Bilingual education has
sponsored several professional development
Education & Libraries 
2010 Annual Report
seminars to enhance teacher's understanding
and ability to address the complex needs of
ELLs. These professional development
offerings have been on -going throughout the
year, including summer months, and have
enjoyed the participation of faculty across
grade levels and from every department. Also
this year, the bilingual department has leant its
particular expertise to several committees in
the district reviewing curriculum, assessment,
intervention, literacy, and data relating to the
education of all students in Framingham.
Finally, in the area of continual professional
growth and in recognition of Framingham' s
expertise, the Bilingual Education Department
was invited and has participated in several
Department of Elementary and Secondary
Education sponsored initiatives forELLs: the
newly organized Urban ELL Director's
Network, DESE Curriculum Summit,
Massachusetts Reading Association - MRA
ELL Ad -Hoc Committee, among others.
Another area of growth for the Bilingual
Education Department this year has been to
establish a  town -wide Bilingual Parent
Advisory Council. Thepurpose ofthegroup
is to provide parents of limited English
proficient students an opportunity to meet
and discuss the unique needs of their ELL
children. The firstorganizational meetingwas
held in the Fall to solicit input from parents
and to form a core leadership group. 20 -30
parentswereinattendance. Fromthatinitial
meeting, several parents volunteered to serve
on steering committee and they planned and
successfully held the first B -PAC meeting
with approximately 35 -45 parents of limited
English proficient children.
Education is truly a team effort and it is with
great admiration and appreciation for the
efforts of everyone involved, including
teachers, paraprofessionals, tutors, parents,
students, and administration, that I
respectfully submit this brief snapshot on
behalf of  the Bilingual Education
Department.

Transportation Department
The Transportation Department provides a
vital service for the Framingham Public
Schools. Overfivethousand public school
students utilize bus transportation on a daily
basis. The transportation office continues to
work diligently to ensure our students with
safeandefficient transport. Massachusetts
General Law requires the School
Departments to provide transportation to all
children outside 2 miles of each respective
district school in grades K - 6. To that end,
Framingham provides school transportation
to three hundred students in non -public
schools in Framingham. Due to budget
constraints, the School Department moved to
a fee -based transportation program seven
years ago for those students in grades 7 -  12.
Fees are waived for special circumstances
such as children placed in Framingham foster
care homes, homeless students, special
education students and students on medical
waivers. The district does have limited seats
available for purchase for students who live
within 2 miles for grades K —12.
The Transportation Department works
closely with the Framingham Police
Department's Safety Division and the Public
Works Department and is a member of the
Local Emergency Planning Committee.

technologies.
The 2010 -2011 school year builds upon the
inertia of the 2009 -2010 technology growth
and focuses specifically on deploying over
1 VOIP phones, operating schools with
an entirely new student information system,
and expanding the role of network copying
and printing throughout the district.
Furthermore, the district continues to expand
its managed wireless network in an effort to
provide each school with 100% wireless
network coverage by the start of school in fall
of 2011.
Looking forward, the Office of Technology is
creating a long -range technology plan to guide

As in recent past reports, this report discusses
from the perspective of the Committee the
principal items with which the Committee was
concerned during the year. It is  a
representative account of matters solely
within the policy making authority of the
Committee and also of matters which the
Superintendent /Director brought before the
Committee for information and consultation.
For greater detail and discussion the reader
should read the extended minutes of
Committee meetings and the attachments
thereto which are available at the school

the Town of Framingham elected at the April
town election, and the return of Mr. John
Kahn, re- elected for a third term, also from
the Town of Framingham. The Committee
received with regret the resignation of
Michelle Gates, Hopkinton Representative,
due to personal reasons.
The balance of this report presents a summary
of the discussion and actions of the
Committee on a number of the important
matters brought before the Committee for
advice or action.
Community Engagement
The Superintendent responded to  a
neighborhood concern presented by Mr.
Rossi about street obstruction and resulting
traffic and safety hazards presented in the
neighborhood of the school by on- street
parking due to weekend and holiday rentals of
the building. Reduction of the problem
depends upon cooperation with the Park and
Recreation and School Departments and upon
imposition in rental agreements of limits on
the number of attendees and contributions to
the cost of needed police details.
Administration
The Superintendent's Evaluation Sub -
Committee considered the process by which
the Committee and the Superintendent
together establish goals for the administration
against which the Superintendent's
performance is evaluated periodically by the
Committee. The Sub -Committee proposed
that it be reorganized to achieve broader
participation among 
the  towns'
representatives and to maintain some
continuity in its work. The on -going Sub-
160

Committee members are John Kahn. Michelle
Gates, William Gaine, Linda Fobes and Dr.
Stephen Kane, Chair.
The School Committee adopted goals for the
Superintendent' s performance evaluation
period from February 2010 through June 30,
2011. The goals adopted related to:
developing District budgets that will meet the
approval of the District town and managing
them effectively; securing 
collective
bargaining agreements with representatives of
the faculty and administration; continuing to
stabilize and to increase the student
population; developing instructional practices
and performance evaluation procedures that
will result in improvement of student
performance indicators; and new career and
technical curriculum components to build
student hope and confidence in their ability to
achieve success in school, the work place and
society.
Principal Canali informed parents and
guardians of Keefe students that in November
they could begin at any time to obtain
electronic access to their student's schedule,
attendance, assignments and grades through
the Yortal system through the Keefe web site
link to the zPass login.
The Committee completed its periodic
evaluation of  the  Superintendent's
accomplishments against established goals and
desired personal qualities.
The complete record of that evaluation is a
public document that is available at the Keefe
office.
The Committee approved a new contract with
the Superintendent extending his employment
through June 30, 2014. The salary for the year
ending June 30, 2011 was set at $156,800
which is subject to renegotiation as of June
2011. The text of the contract is a public
document and may be seen at the Keefe

Education & Libraries 
2010 Annual Report
During the course of the year the
Superintendent and Richard DeAngelis, Esq.,
the Committee's representatives, negotiated
with representatives of the several employee
units to arrive at collective bargaining
agreements. They reported the progress of
the negotiations to the full Committee in
executive sessions and periodically received
instructions as to the position of the
Committee. When theagreements havebeen
finalized they will be public documents.
Reorganization of the Vocational Program
The administration reported to  the
Committee that it had implemented a major
reorganization of the first year vocational
program for the purposes of improving the
vocational and academic instruction at Keefe;
enhancing the learning experiences of our
students and realizing financial savings due to
staffing efficiencies. The adoption of this
program resulted in  a  reduction of
approximately $ 400,000 in the FY 2011
budget request.
The principal features of the reorganized
program are:
1) Freshmen
instructional 
will
time 
receive additional
in  core content
academic subjects.
2) Freshmen will explore the vocational -
technical courses in the career and
technical educational laboratories ( CTE),
in four continuous periods with highly
qualified instructors.
3) Freshmen will enter their actual shop in
January of their first year at Keefe instead
of in their second year.
4) CTE shops and laboratories will be fully
utilized by our students.
5) The schedule will result in staffing
efficiencies in CTE, academic, and
technology services.
6) Earlier shop experience will allow earlier
access to Co- operative programs.
7) Academic instruction will be primarily
provided in double periods.
8) This reorganization plan will free up
vocational laboratory space for the
161
Page 173
Town of Framingham
possible future expansion of CTE
offerings.
9) Grade 9 students will be exposed earlier
and more fully to the reality of their
proposed vocation.
School Improvement Plans
The Committee reviewed the progress toward
the goals of the 2009 -  2010 School
Improvement Plan. The report of Principal
Canali noted tangible specific improvements
in school access security measures; significant
improvements in  student deportment
evidenced by decreases in tardiness and out of
school suspensions and an increase in
attendance to approximately 92 %;  an increase
in the number of athletic teams to 17 and
increased student activities 24; stabilization of
the student population; and efforts by the
Professional Development Committee to
meet the instructional and technology needs
of the faculty.
The Committee adopted The School
Improvement Plan for the 2010 -  2011 which
embodies specific performance objectives as
follows: (1) maintaining and providing a safe
environment for all individuals who use
school facilities for education, athletics and
community events; (2) developing,
implementing and evaluating the
effectiveness of programs in meeting their
goals; (3) expanding community partnerships
and communications with all constituents; and
4) using data to assess existing programs to
bring about productive initiatives to stabilize
and increase enrollment.
School and Student Safety, Security and
Well Being
Keefe's new comprehensive student
disciplinary code was implemented. The code
eliminates the traditional demerit system in
favor of a more positive focus on modeling
appropriate behaviors consistent with Keefe's
teaching objectives. Initial results indicate a
marked decline in indicators of behaviors that
impact adversely on the learning experience
Education & Libraries 
2010 Annual Report
such as incidents of tardiness, repeat offender
suspensions and Saturday detentions.
The Committee requested the Principal to
continue exploring health food options under
the school' s wellness plan. Cafeteria menus
seek to utilize ingredients offered by the state
school lunch program efforts in presenting
healthy options.
Soft drink and snack vending machines have
been replaced with a  nutritionally sound
bottled water /juice vending unit.
The Committee approved revisions to the
Student Handbook that had previously been
approved by the School Council. Major
changes relate to: providing extra help for
students who exceed the maximum of 12
unexcused absences; authorizing, upon due
process, the principal to suspend a student
upon issuance of a felony complaint or to
expel a  student upon conviction; and
inclusion of state compliant provisions
regarding bullying. The policy is available on
the Keefe web site.
After detailed consideration of Keefe's
comprehensive bullying policy it  was
unanimously approved by the Committee.
Race to the Top Program
The Superintendent in  January 2010
recommended that Keefe participate in the
state and national competition to qualify for a
portion of the $250,000000, grant available
under the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act. With the essential
cooperation among the administration, the
Keefe Teachers' Association and the School
Committee the Committee approved Keefe's
participation. Eligibility for the grant requires
significant changes in instructional methods
and the use of data in assessing student
achievement and in teacher evaluation.
Although Massachusetts received the ARRA
grant the amount distributable to school
districts is approximately $125,000000,with
the balance being retained by the DESE. The
Committee designated Mr. Goldin to
162
Page 174
Town of Framingham
participate with the Superintendent and a
representative of the KTEA to develop an
application to participate in the distribution to
districts. Subsequently the Committee
received the Race -to -the -Top Proposal that
was submitted to the Department of
Education. Sixprojectareaswereincluded in
the grant requirements: ( 1) Defining an
educator evaluation framework; (2) Aligning
the school curriculum to the state common
core; (  3) Strengthening the school's
climate/ culture; (4) Increasing the school's
interoperability capability among academic
institutions; ( 5) Increasing the number of
graduates completing the Masscore program
to achieve college eligibility; (6) Closing the
proficiency gap in mathematics and ELA
through technology enhancement. An
agreement was reached and an application was
submitted but was unsuccessful.
Post Graduate Program
The Keefe post -graduate program serves
current or recent (1 to 21/2 year) high school
graduates from member towns. Enrollees
have met their academic requirements for
graduation and participate only to the extent
of available positions in their chosen
vocational program.
The Budget Process
The Budget Sub - committee, Members
Burman, Hopkins, Lanoue and Gates, under
the Chair, Mr. Filledes presented a preliminary
budget representing a  6.62% increase
999.186) over the prior year's actual budget.
The final budget for FY 2010 had been a
reduction of 1.16% from the FY 2009 budget.
The Superintendent continued his practice of
meeting informally early in the budget process
with the financial officers of the member
towns to develop mutual awareness of both
municipal budget constraints and the efforts
of the Committee to manage the school
efficiently and effectively while recognizing
those limitations. The Committee continued
to consider reductions in the preliminary
budget and the budget as submitted to the
Education & Libraries 
2010 Annual Report
member towns and approved by all
15,770) 092,represented an increase only of
22,061 or 1' / 2% over the prior year.
The District assessment for FY '11 in terms
of per pupil cost for each of the member
towns compared to the prior year are Ashland
down $ 340; Framingham — down $ 621;
Holliston — up $39; Hopkinton —down $27;
Natick — down $146. The cost per pupil is
driven by several factors that include: changes
in the District budget, local credits, minimum
required contribution and the student
enrollment of each town.
The administration under the leadership of
Business Manager, Kirsteen Leveillee is
preparing for a conversion to a more current
accounting system and software which will
increase the efficiency of the business
operation, increase accuracy and enable the
preparation of a more comprehensive set of
reports, including historical data, reports for
management use. 
The system will become
operational in increments with a  twelve
month completion deadline.
Auditor's Report
The annual audit by the independent
accounting firm of McCarthy &  Hargrave
disclosed no inaccuracies in the financial
statements and only two minor procedural
errors which had been corrected.
State Aid
The Governor and Legislature again proposed
reductions in state aid to transportation.
These funds provide access to regional
schools where transportation networks extend
across community lines. Moreover, cuts made
after member communities have approved
balanced regional school budgets based upon
reliable forecasts may require significant
reductions in educational programs. The
Superintendent and the Committee Chair,
with the support of the Committee, addressed
their concerns to the Governor and State
legislators and to the Massachusetts
Association of School Committees.

Siemens' Energy Conservation Project
The annual Performance Assurance Summary
for the measurement year ended May 23, 2010
documented that had the cost of gas
continued to increase in the second year as
projected, the projected savings ($550,000)
based on gas consumption would have
exceeded the projected savings by $27,600. In
fact, due to the decrease in gas rates, the
actual savings due to the program ($495,000)
were less by $ 26,000) than the total
guaranteed savings. The actual savings
exceeded the amortization requirement of the
Lease Purchase Agreement through which the
cost of the project was financed.
The school's independent auditors report on
the project noted that as of the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2009 the District's general
fund had realized a  net savings of over
250,000 due to the project.
Personnel Administration
The Committee continued to wrestle with the
issue of maintaining an appropriate health
insurance program in the face of rising costs.
The Employee Health Advisory Committee
met and recommended that the District
employees increase their co -pay commitment
and thereby realize a  cost savings on
premiums. This would be cost effective for
subscribers and for the District. The
Committee approved the recommendation.
Enrollment, Recruiting and Student
Retention
In March the administration organized a new
effort to bring the advantages offered by
Keefe to the attention of 8` graders in the
member towns. Building on the school's
Summer Discover Program the school was
visited by 45 potential enrollees over four
days who participated in vocational and
athletic activities and their parents. They were
invited to see the graphics, culinary arts, and
auto and carpentry shops. Transportation was
provided from the participating middle
Education & Libraries 
2010 Annual Report
schools and parent picked up the students at
Keefe.
The Freshman Parents' Night was held in
September with 88 parents attending from
each of the member towns. There was a Fall
Open House to which students and parents of
the middle schools in all towns were invited
through the cooperation this year of each of
the towns.
The Committee adopted a revised admissions
policy developed to conform to Department
of Elementary &  Secondary Education
DESE) requirements to  assure that
vocational schools' admissions are neutral as
to race, sex, religion, English language facility
or learning disability. The DESE had
reviewed and approved the proposed policy.
Buildings and Grounds
An engineering survey disclosed that the
smoke stack at the southerly end of the
building, an original element of the heating
and cooling system, urgently needed extensive
repair beyond the capacity of the maintenance
staff. Temporary repairs and retrofitting as
performed in 2002 are not sufficient for the
long term. The Superintendent reported that
the administration will strive to contain repair
costs and apply operational funds as available.
A sub - committee of Mr. Kahn and Mr. Rossi
was appointed to explore the matter with the
administration.
The Superintendent discussed with the
Committee the need for additional athletic
fields to support the enlarged athletic
program. The Committee informally advised
him to explore the project with departments
of the Town of Framingham.
Student Achievement
The District received from the DESE its
annual accountability report detailing Keefe's
Adequate Yearly Progress. Based upon the
AYP criteria which includes: the level of
student participation in the MCAS testing;
meeting state performance targets; attainment
of the District's own improvement target and
achievement of attendance and graduation
targets, Keefe students satisfied achieved

Adequate Yearly Progress over all and in all
identified subgroups in English Language Arts
ELA) and Mathematics. In September all
parents or guardians of Keefe students
received the Keefe Report Card notifying
them of this accomplishment and of other
pertinent information.
In summary, from 2007 to 2010 in ELA the
number of students scoring at proficient or
above increased by 19% while the number of
students failing decreased by 8 %.  For math
the number at proficient or higher increased
by 10% while the number failing decreased by
2 %.
In December the Committee was informed
that according to the 5 level scaling system
created by the DESE under the Educational
Reform Act of 2010 Keefe has been
categorized in level 3. That reflects that Keefe
ranks, along with five or six others vocational
schools, among the lowest performing 20% of
all high schools in the Commonwealth with
respect to absolute achievement and
improvement trend. In 2011 the factor of
annual growth rate will be included in the
determination. As the formula to be used in
the 2011 calculation is still being developed by
DESE it is not possible to predict the effect
on Keefe's status of the generally favorable
rate of improvement Keefe students
demonstrate when their 10`''grade ( Keefe)
scores are compared with their 8` grade
Middle School) scores.
In February Keefe hosted 600 student
participants in the Skills USA District
Competition at which our students received 7
gold medals, 10 silver and 3 bronze.
A separate building construction competition
was held in April at the Royal Trade Center in
Marlborough.
A newly formed Drama Club in March
presented as its first offering, the popular
comedy "The Princess Bride."The event was
open to students during school hours and to
parents and friends in the evening. The stage

2010 Annual Report
sets were constructed by the vocational shops
and the crew and cast, under the leadership of
Principal Patricia Canali, added a  new
dimension to the Keefe experience.
General Advisory Board
The General Advisory Board consists of the
Chair of each Vocational Advisory Board.
The General Board summarizes and brings to
the attention of the administration and the
School Committee observations and
recommendations of the advisory boards. The
points noted for the current year include: the
need to continually align the curriculum with
changes in technology; outreach to bring
Keefe's program to potential students;
increasing opportunities for students and
employers in the co -op program; successful
pursuit of grant funding for state of the art
vocational equipment; and maintaining the
license status of student professional
programs that advance Keefe students'
vocational entry opportunities.

Framingham Public Library
49 Lexington St. (Main) 1508-5570532- 1  library.public @framinghamma. gov
New Director, Assistant Director
The Library Trustees are pleased to announce
that in December, 2010, we appointed Acting
Director, Jeanne Kelley, to become Library
Director. Jeanne Kelley is well -qualified for
the position, having served for six years as
Acting Director, three years as Director of the
Literacy Unlimited Program, and six years as
Branch Librarian. She also served as Acting
Director in 2005. Mark Contois, Director
from January 2006 until August, 2010, left
Framingham to become Head Librarian of the
Worcester Library. The transition has been
smooth.
In February, 2011, Jeanne Kelley selected Jane
Peck, Branch Librarian for nine years, to
become Assistant Director. Previously, Jane
Peck was Assistant Director of the Needham
Public Library. A search is under way for a
new Branch Librarian.
Reaching Out to the Community
The Library collaborated with Framingham
State University to plan and present a unique
fall lifelong learning series that offered ten
free sessions on `How to be a Cineliterate,'
Thinking like Thoreau,' and other topics.
Five sessions led by faculty from FSU and
other academic institutions were offered at
each location. The series proved so popular
that plans were made to offer a winter /spring
series for 2011. Throughout the year, the
Library collaborated with The Boys and Girls
Club for a Mixing in Math project and the
YMCA on summer programming for
children. Staff attended registrations for the
Framingham Adult ESL Program (FAESL),
provided tables for the health fair, a
presentation for Programs for People. We
regularly attended meetings of Framingham
Community Partners and the START
Partnership. 
The rich variety of weekly programming
offered to the community continued
throughout the year with popular film series,
Sunday concerts, children's performances and
other events, many times with overflow
crowds.
Summer Reading Program
The Library offered its first Adult Summer
Reading Program in 2010 asking "Why should
kids have all the fun ?"  and through the
generosity of local businesses gave away free
tee shirts to all 339 participants. At the end of
the summer, 1,237 grand prize raffle tickets
were entered for the grand prize of a blu -ray
player. In the children's Summer Reading
Program, 1,530 children participated in 2010
who also received tee shirts and prizes
throughout the summer months.
Friends of the Library
The Friends of the Framingham Library
raised thousands of dollars through their
monthly and ongoing book sale to support
the collections, summer reading and adult and
children's programming. Their dedication and
hard work continues to provide programs and
services that would not be possible without
their help. Please consider joining this
important group.
The Framingham Public Library
Foundation
The Framingham Public Library Foundation
was created in 2010 as a way to provide
funding for projects and initiatives that
complement, but do not supplant, the Town's
financial responsibility for the operation of
the Library system. Examples of projects that
may be funded by the FPL Foundation
include building renovations, capital projects,
and special programs.
The long -term goal of the Foundation is to
build an endowment, to help provide
Education & Libraries  166
Page 178
Town of Framingham
materials, programs and facilities that enrich
the cultural fabric of the Town of
Framingham and the quality of life of its
residents. Donors can contribute in several
ways: Annual Appeals, Memorial Gifts, direct
donations, and bequests.
In the coming year, the primary focus of the
Foundation will be a capital campaign to raise
funds to build a  new McAuliffe Branch
Library. The Foundation's fundraising
committee, chaired by Jason Smith, will solicit
donations from corporations and individuals
with the goal of providing additional funds for
the project beyond what the Massachusetts
Board of Library Commissioners construction
grant and town funding may provide.
McAuliffe Branch Library Project:
A Need, Plus an Opportunity
McAuliffe Branch Library outgrew its space
more than ten years ago. The second busiest
branch library in  Massachusetts, the
McAuliffe Branch Library is one of the
smallest branch libraries in  the
Commonwealth. Ithas 12,000 visitors a
month and is responsible for 33% of the
Framingham Public Library's total circulation.
In May, 2010, the Massachusetts Board of
Library Commissioners announced a  new
Library Construction Grant opportunity. As
branch libraries are now on a par with main
libraries and as Framingham is eligible to
receive about 50% of the cost of the land and
the building, the Trustees decided to apply for
a 2010 Construction Grant.
When asked what they would like to see in a
new Branch Library, the community said it
wanted larger children's and young adult
areas, comfortable reading space, study and
tutoring rooms, and a  meeting room. In
addition, patrons mentioned that a  new
McAuliffe should be energy- efficient and fully
accessible.
With these requirements and Town Meeting
approval at the October 19, 2010 Fall Town
Education & Libraries 
2010 Annual Report
Meeting, we engaged Vandermark Consulting
to develop a program or feasibility study for a
new Branch. We issued RFQs and engaged
Finegold Alexander &  Associates as our
Architects and Design Technique, Inc. as our
Owner's Project Manager.
In November we issued an RFP for land on
Water Street for the new McAuliffe Branch.
We received two bids and selected a wooded
site at 732 -746 RR Water Street owned by the
A.J. Rousseau Trust.
At the January 12, 2011 Special Town
Meeting, Town Meeting approved the
concept design. Town Meeting also
authorized the purchase of a site at 746 Water
Street for the new McAuliffe Branch Library,
contingent upon receiving a Massachusetts
Board of Library Commissioners grant and
receiving authorization at a  later Town
Meeting for the Town's share of the funds for
a  new McAuliffe building. The price is
710,000.
We then submitted the grant application along
with the preliminary design. The MBLC will
announce grant awards on July 14, 2011.
Library Trustee News
In April, 2010, incumbents Robert Dodd,
Elizabeth Fideler, Ruth Winett, and Chris
Walsh were elected to serve as Trustees for
three -year terms.

collaboration between the Library and the
Schools, as well as other community
organizations. Other goals are to upgrade the
Main Library to make it more accessible and
more convenient and to evaluate and
eventually introduce self -check out systems,
eBook readers, as well as to improve customer
service.
We appreciate Town Meeting's support. We
also appreciate the help and support provided
by the Board of Selectmen, Town Manager,
Assistant Town Manager, Chief Financial
Officer, Town Counsel and staff, and all of
the Town's Department and Department
Heads throughout the process. We also

procedure for the RCN managed fiber
optic network connecting all Town
buildings.
We also negotiated the waiver of fees for
certain set -top boxes for RCN cable TV
customers in Framingham. The license
transfer was approved at the June 8, 2010
meeting.
The CAC also took the following actions:
Helped negotiate service issues including
billing and repair with Town Residents.
Followed up on completion of Verizon's
fiber optic cabling service and notified
residents who requested notice.
Obtained a  new Google telephone
number that the CAC will publish for
residents to contact the CAC if there is
any unresolved billing or repair issues in
regards to RCN, Verizon and Comcast.
Began the process of designing and
implementing a Town web page for the
CAC.

General Committees 
CAPITAL BUDGET COMMITTEE
The Capital Budget Committee ( CBC)
consists of six Town Meeting Members
appointed by the Town Moderator, and
one representative from the Finance
Committee. The role of the CBC is to
recommend to Town Meeting for
approval all capital projects with a cost of
at least $25,000 and an expected useful life
of five years.
This year at the Annual Town Meeting,
the CBC recommended for approval
General Fund projects amounting to
6,385. 018, The source of funding for
virtually all of these General Fund
projects was from bonding. The
requested projects included the following
departments: Fire, Library, Building
Services /Capital Projects, Parks and
Recreation, Police, Public Works,
Highway, Sanitation, Schools and Tech
Services.
In addition the CBC recommended to
Town Meeting Enterprise Funds projects
totaling $25,000. 369, The projects were
as follows: Water Enterprise Fund
17,000967, and Sewer Enterprise Fund
7,000. 402, The sources of funding were
from bonding. A substantial portion of
the bonding projects will be at interest
rates of2% or less. In addition, the Town
is hopeful that some stimulus funding will
be  received from the Federal
Government.
It was a very challenging year for the
CBC. The Committee made some very
difficult decisions due to limited Town
funds and a never ending list of capital
169

projects requested by the various Town
departments /divisions. The Committee
plays a very critical role in the long -term
futureoftheTown'sinfrastructure. We
will continue to work closely with the
Chief Financial Officer in order to make
recommendations of projects that benefit
our Town, while maintaining fiscal
responsibility.
I would like to thank all members of the
CBC (Jeanne Bullock, Matt Calder, Kevin
Crotty, Ed Kross, Dick Weader and
Nancy Wilson) for their time and efforts
during the year. It is a privilege to serve
with such dedicated members.

Cushing Chapel Advisory
Committee
The Cushing Chapel Advisory Committee
consists of eleven members appointed by
theBoardofSelectmen. The Cushing
Chapel Advisory Committee is in the
review stage for new and current
applicants via the Board of Selectman.
Some of the projects undertaken this past
year have included the Chapel steeple
which was due for refurbishment. The
steeple was scraped, sanded, primed and
finished with two coats of brilliant white
paint by Borg Painting Company. This
has resulted in making the outside a
pristine and welcoming area for our
residents and visitors.
Also this past year the Chapel Committee
has undertaken producing a new brochure
with pictures, a  short history of the
Chapel and general information about
utilizing the Chapel. This beautiful and
informative brochure was created by in-
house committee members Cynthia
Laurom and Karolyne White, who did
beautiful work on the brochure. We
would also like to thank and acknowledge
the Framingham Garden Club whose
members keep the grounds lovely with
displays of flowers and shrubs year after
year, adding to the serene beauty of the
Chapel area.
In closing, the support of the community,
Town officials and Town departments is
appreciated and acknowledged by the

July 26th, 2010 marked the 20th
Anniversary of the passage 
of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),a
Federal Civil Rights Law. Though much
has been accomplished in 20 years there is
still much more that needs to be done to
ensure the Town is in compliance with
ADA laws.
There have been many access
improvements to Town buildings. In the
Town Hall, the elevator was renovated,
upgraded and brought up to code. A new
ramp was installed at Town Hall thereby
creating a second accessible entrance for
people with Disabilities. The Housing
Authority developed many new accessible
housing units. Many new curb cuts have
been installed throughout town.
The History Center began to bring the
Village Hall into ADA compliance with
the installation of a ramp on the side
entrance. We look forward to the eventual
completion of all accessibility projects on
this historical building allowing all people
to enjoy it. The Disability Commission
also hired architectural firm Mendes,
Torrey and Spencer to examine the
feasibility of having a handicap ramp at
the main entrance of the building.
The new Bowditch Field re- opened and is
now fully accessible for people with
Disabilities. TheADATransitionPlan
Sub - committee continues to oversee the
implementation of the 2005 Transition
Plan to ensure that Town -owned
buildings are ADA compliant.
In October, FDC members attended the
Open Meeting Law Training. The
Commission joined with the Department
of Mental Health for their event- 
2010
Celebrating Heroes- a  Community
Recognition Event ".  In November,
Jeffrey Dougan of the Mass. Office on
Disability, attended our FDC meeting to
update the FDC on disability matters and
access laws.
From the HP Fine Account Fund the
FDC provided funding assistance to two
wonderful programs for children with
disabilities. In August, the FDC funded
3,300 to the Lose the Training Wheels
program. This program teaches children
with disabilities how to ride a bike. In
September, we funded $3,750 to the Piers
Park Adaptive Sailing program. This
program teaches children with various
disabilities how to sail a boat.
We'd like to say good -bye and thank you
to  former Commissioner, Thelma
Berman. She had been a Commissioner
since 2002 and was a long time advocate
for people with psychiatric disabilities.
We would also like to thank all the Town
Departments and Town Meeting for their
continued support of our important
programs and activities. We will continue
to work closely with all Town
Departments to ensure that Framingham
is in compliance with all State and Federal
access/ disability laws.

Finance Committee
The Finance Committee is comprised of
nine members appointed by the Town
Moderator for a term of three years. The
Finance Committee recommends action
to Town Meeting regarding the budget
and other areas of finance. Other key
responsibilities include authorizing
disbursements from the Reserve Fund for
emergency expenses, authorizing deficit
spending for emergency winter -related
expenses, approving the expenditure
ceiling for revolving funds and monitoring
the Town's annual audit.
The workload for the Finance Committee
requires a commitment of significant time
from the volunteers who serve on it. In
2010, the Committee met 26 times, and
participated in the Annual Town Meeting
and three Special Town Meetings.
Members often have significant
responsibilities beyond regular Finance
Committee meetings. The Committee
provides representatives to the Real
Property and Capital Budget committees
under Town bylaws. In 2010, the Finance
Committee representative to  the
Structural Deficit Review Task Force also
chaired the Task Force. The Committee
routinely appoints liaisons to Keefe Tech
and the School Department to monitor
their independent budget development
processes. Further, the Committee's three -
member Audit Subcommittee meets with
the Town's outside audit firm and the
Chief Financial Officer's staff to resolve
audit findings. 
2010
This year was characterized by significant
fiscal challenges. Revenue growth was
disrupted due to ongoing unpredictability
in state and federal government revenue
sources, decline in local receipts, especially
excise taxes and building permit fees, and
limited newgrowth in property taxes. At
the same time, large expenses such as
health care, special education out -of-
district tuition, and certain collective
bargaining agreements continue to
escalate faster than revenue growth.
The Finance Committee continued to
emphasize the need for the Town to break
the cycle of living beyond its means,
recommending that the Town:
Ensure that salaries and benefits do not
grow faster than projected revenue;
Minimize dependence on unreliable
revenue sources like grants, revolving
funds, withdraws or diversions from the
stabilization fund, free cash, and stimulus
money to support recurring expenses;
Maximize operational efficiencies in areas
such as transportation, building use,
purchasing, and maintaining properties;
and
Eliminate overlapping functions and
duplicate functions through administrative
consolidations.
The Finance Committee's budget
recommendations targeted immediate
fiscal realities while laying critical
groundwork for long -term financial
stability. In FY 2011, the School
Department budget difficulties increased.
Federal stimulus money began to
disappear, and salary increases negotiated
in the School Department collective
bargaining agreements presented
challenges. The Finance Committee took
a strong position supporting the need to
resolve the increasing structural deficit in
the School Department budget, which
General Committees  172
Page 184
Town of Framingham
Annual Report
served as a catalyst in the creation of the
Structural Deficit Reduction Task Force.
The Committee also made specific
recommendations for addressing several
long -term challenges:
equity in collective bargaining;
planning for unfunded liabilities;
health care cost containment;
stability of town services;
economic development;
shrinking new growth;
shrinking revenue growth; and
affordable property taxes.
The following Reserve Fund
appropriations were made in 2010:
30,000 to cover the cost of a special
Senate election, $35,000 for Medicare
Taxes. The $30,000 for the elections was
returned to the reserve fund after the
Town received additional funds from the
state. Per provisions of MGL, the Finance
Committee authorized deficit spending
for Snow and Ice in FY 2010.
Members of the Finance Committee as of
December 31, 2010: Linda Dunbrack,
Chair ( 2012);Daniel Lampl, Vice Chair

an excellent year. We met nine times with
active participation and lively, productive
discussion.
The committee submitted a warrant article
to update the General Bylaws with regard
to the Council on Aging. This was
passed. We also submitted a warrant
article to eliminate the Personnel Board.
This was referred back to the GSC by
town meeting. We are continuing to work
on this issue with the moderator and the
Ways andMeansCommittee. We also
evaluated several other warrant articles
and reported our findings to town
meeting.
The committee also had discussions on
town versus city form of government,
moving town elections to the fall, the
Greener Framingham Committee, and
town meeting member ethics. Weare
continuing to work with the Standing
Committee on Public Safety on a proposal
to curb excessive public safety calls and to
research issues involved in possible
changes to our form of town government.
The Government Study Committee has an
ongoing commitment to serving as
advisor to town meeting and to the
betterment ofour town government. We
look forward to the future with
confidence and enthusiasm.
Historical Commission
As in years past, The Framingham

demolition. When buildings slated for
demolition were determined to be

the FHC worked diligently with the
owners to seek alternatives to the loss of
these valuable resources.
The biggest accomplishment this past year
was a complete review of Framingham's
Cultural Resources Inventory. The
members ofthe Commission, along with
some student volunteers from
Framingham State University, visited
every one of the nearly 700 buildings on
the inventory and took updated
photographs ofeach and every one. The
new images and updated listing are now
available to the public and to the Town's

Technology Advisory Committee
2010 continued to be a challenging year
for the Technology Advisory Committee
TAC).The TAC has an immediate and
long- standing concern that the Town's
Technology Director position has been
vacant for3 years now. In ourpersonal
and business lives we all know that
technology, well applied, can increase
efficiency and decrease costs.
Framingham is saving money in salary by
leaving this position vacant, but we fear
that continued delay in filling this role will
ultimately end up costing the Town more
money. We would note that we respect
and admire the work of the acting
Assistant Director of Technology, Carly
Melo Premo, and appreciate Carly's
continuing to maintain a partnership with
theTAC. However, filling the Town's
Technology Director position needs to be
a priority in early 2011.

Framingham' s Annual Town Meeting
began on May 4 and met 11 times to
consider a  warrant composed of 36
articles which consisted of administrative,
fiscal, policy and zoning articles. The
operating budget for fiscal 2011 saw the
most discussion as Town Meeting
approved an  appropriation of
204,986450,for the fiscal year beginning
July 1, 2010.
Town Meeting also met on three
occasions for Special Town Meetings. On
January 26, Town Meeting met once and
discussed two articles. A Special Town
Meeting was also convened during the
annual meeting on May 12 which met for
two nights to consider eight articles. The
third Special Town Meeting was convened
on October 19 and met for five nights to
consider 16 articles. Overall, Town
Meeting met 19 times in 2010 to consider
a total of 62 articles in fulfillment of its
function as the legislative part of town
government.
At every meeting, Town Meeting
members listened carefully, thoughtfully
discussed, debated and voted each ofthe
articles presented for their consideration.
Town Meeting members this year totaled
186 out of a total of 216 authorized seats
12 seats for each of 18 precincts).Nine
precincts had full membership while
openings occurred in precincts 2 (2),8 (3),
9 (2),10 (1),14 (3),15 (4),16 (4),17 (7),
and 18 (4).
Town Meetings are the result of the
efforts or many different people. A special
thank you is owed to the Town Clerk and
Town Meeting 
her staff. Thanks also go the Board of
Selectmen, the Town Manager and his

Standing Committee on
Education
The Standing Committee on Education
concerns itself with the activities, budgets
and related warrant articles pertaining to
Framingham Public Schools, Joseph P.
Keefe Technical School and the
FraminghamPublicLibrarysystem. The
Committee meets regularly with
representatives of each organization.
During the course of 2010 the Committee
reviewed the Framingham Public School
proposed Reorganization Plan and offered
reports to Town Meeting on the FY2011
Public School budget, the warrant article
proposing to restore school bus funding, 
2010
the FY 2011 Keefe Tech budget and the
FY 2011 Library budget and the warrant
article requesting authorization to pursue
a building grant to replace the McAuliffe
branch library. Work continues on both
budget and strategic concerns in each
organization.

Standing Committee on Public
Safety
In 2010 the Standing Committee on
Public Safety continued in its role of
deliberating and reporting to Town
Meeting on articles relating to public
safety.
Due to a number of precinct vacancies,
we've faced some challenges obtaining
quorums for our meetings this year. This
has made it  particularly difficult to
maintain a focus on initiatives undertaken
in previous years, though we continue
working to move these issues forward.
We look forward to continuing to work
with the Police, Fire, and Inspection
Services divisions in 2011, as well as
continuing to reach out to other boards
and committees regarding areas of mutual
concern.

Works
Framingham's grim financial prospects
heavily influenced the committee's
actions. The SCPW determined this

Annual Report
outlook mandated improved cooperation
and liaison between the chair and both the
Board of  Selectmen and the
Administration, aswell astheneed forthe
chairto fullyinformTown Meeting. Two
key issues dominated in addition to the
required review of warrant articles.
The first was to bring closure to the
outstanding sewer billings of major out -
of -town accounts as well as over -billing by
theMWRA. TheSCPW thusvotedtocall
a  Special Town Meeting and hire
independent counsel to handle collection
on a contingency basis. The committee
took note that the town hired
independent counsel in the SMOC case.
As 2010 ended, a SCPW taskforce drafted
four articles to be reviewed for a special
warrant. Additional answers and data were
still deemed necessary from the
Administration. We believe independent
counsel would be the best way to speed
up collections. For example, it took close
to 30 years to obtain a successful outcome
in the Ashland case, and that the
campaign to recoup money from the
Natick accounts is already in its 15th year.
The other major issue is the delay in
activating the Birch Road Wells. The
DPW told the SCPW that the main
obstacle is the MWRA, and that the
problem is " political ".  The SCPW, along
with the Capital Budget Committee, will
research how Town funds have been
expended and what can finally be done to
expedite activation of these vital wells.
Respectfully submitted,
Larry Schmeidler, Chair
Standing Committee on Rules
The Rules Committee meets regularly to
discuss ways of improving the workings
of Town Meeting (TM).We want TM 
2010
members to make informed decisions on
motions and have the actions taken
recorded in the Town Meeting Journal.
We also request reports at the Annual
Town Meeting based on motions and
resolutions made during the previous year.
In 2010, the Rules Committee completed
its study of using an electronic tally and
display system to count votes at TM. The
sub - committee, consisting of Walter
Adamski, Ed Kross, and Joel Winett,
evaluated a 
number of systems and
selected a system with a mini keypad used
to vote YES, NO, or ABSTAIN. Since
TM cannot have secret votes, the vote of
each TMM is displayed on a screen where
it can be verified, recorded, and made
public. The proposal brought to the
Annual TM requested a  modest
appropriation but was not approved.
Some TM members may have felt that the
benefits did not warrant the expense;
some may have been uncomfortable with
the system and procedures; and others
may not have wanted their vote recorded
and made publically available.
The Rules Committee sponsored warrant
articles to change the bylaws (a) to better
define TM voting procedures, (b) to
request specific reports at TM and, (c) to
insure that the actions of TM are recorded
in the Town Meeting Journal. TM
approved these changes.
In addition, the Rules Committee updated
the Town Meeting Member's Handbook
so that it is a useful working document.

Standing Committee on Ways
and Means
As defined in the Town by -laws, the
Standing Committee on Ways and Means
SCW &M) is  responsible for making
recommendations to town meeting (TM)
on warrant articles sponsored by and /or
related to the Finance Committee, the
Information Services, Finance, and
Human Resources Divisions, and the
Board of Selectmen ( BOS),the Town
Clerk, Town Elections, the Legal
Department, the Retirement Board and
the Capital Budget and Government
Study Committees. Town meeting
convened for the Spring 2010 Annual
Town Meeting (  ATM) and for three
Special Town Meetings (STM).
In the midst of the severe economic
downturn, tackling the 2011 budget for
the ATM was extremely challenging. The
primary goal was to reduce costs without
cutting services. This proved most
challenging with the school department
budget. The SCW &M recommended that
Town Meeting appropriate an additional
600K ( from the local options tax
revenue) to the school budget. TM
supported another motion by the CFO
for an incremental appropriation of
400K ( negotiated between the school
dept.,CFO and Board of Selectmen).
In the 2011 capital budget the SCW &M
recommended and TM voted to eliminate
proposed expenses to renovate the
exterior lobby of the BOS' office and to
build a commercial grade kitchen in the
Memorial building to service Nevins Hall.
TM approved the appointment of a
structural deficit committee at the ATM
and also supported the SCW &M's
recommendation to eliminate three 
2010
positions and change the composition of
that committee to seven members.
The SCWM also proposed and TM voted
to revise the Human Resources Dir. job
description to require ability and management
experaence in the field of human resources.
TM concurred with the SCW &M to refer
article 1  from the Fall STM back to the
sponsor. It would have authorized the
BOS to enter into unrestricted contracts
for solar power without TM approval.
Article 5 in the Fall STM proposed the
elimination of the Personnel Board. TM
supported the SCW &M's motion to refer
that article to the gov't study committee
GSC) for further evaluation, which is
now in collaboration with the SCW &M.
An article was presented at the Fall STM
requesting approval of a new non -union
position classification schedule. The
SCW &M recommended and TM voted to
refer this article back to the sponsor since
the relative wage schedules and financial
impact data were not yet available.
I want to express sincere appreciation to
all committee members. It takes a huge
commitment of time and effort to do the
extensive work of the SCW &M: Teri S.

ARTICIN 16
To see if the Town will vote to amend its Zoning By -law by adding the following:
Section LF Wireless Communications Facilities Temporary Moratorium
1. Purpose andIntent
The increasing use of business and personal devices relying on personal wireless service
facilities, often referred to as wireless communications facilities, particularly recent changes and
trends in the wireless communications industry, such as the advent of3G and 4G networks, new
technologies for wireless communications facilities, and other advances, have generated a
significant number ofapplications for the placement, construction and modification of such
facilities in the Town in recent months. Given the rapidly evolving nature of the underlying
technology, the Town needs time to review and analyze these changes, advances, and trends in a
meaningful and thoughtful way and the range of land use and regulatory issues raised by such
facilities.
Section 1V.L of the Zoning By -law, which governs Wireless Communications Facilities, was
enacted in 1997, soon after the enactment of the federal Telecommunications Act in 1996. Since
then, the technology for wireless communications, and wireless communications facilities, has
changed and advanced at a rapid pace. Recently, it has become clear that the provisions of
SectionIV.Lneedtobere- examined inacomprehensive mannertoaddresstheseadvances. The
Board of Selectmen, in recognition of this, is committed to establishing a committee with the
necessary expertise to analyze the current and projected future technology and to make
comprehensive recommendations for regulating these facilities in compliance with the
Telecommunications Act
By enacting atemporary, six month moratorium, the Town will have time to develop reasonable
regulations regarding the placement, construction and modification of wireless communications
facilities. The Town fully recognizes its responsibilities under the Telecommunications Act of
1996. Full and impartial compliance with the Act is best accomplished through thoughtful
analysis and subsequent regulatory guidance. Therefore, in reliance on the Town's authority
under General Laws chapter 40A and the Massachusetts State Constitution, and in keeping with
Toxn Meeting  221
Page 233
Toavn ofFraminghaw  2090 Annual Report
the Town's responsibilities to protect public health, welfare, and safety, the Town hereby adopts
this temporary moratorium.
2. Temporary Moratorium
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Zoning By -law to the contrary, for a period of six
months from the effective date of this amendment, no building permit, special permit, or
variance shall be issued for the construction, placement, installation, modification, alteration, or
use of any building, structure, or land within the town for the purpose of a wireless
communications facility, as defined in Section IV.L this By -law, withinthe town. Amateurradio
towers, to the extent they are exempt from Zoning By -law requirements under General Laws
chapter 40A §3, and wireless communication facilities for use by police, fire, or other emergency
services are exempt from this moratorium.
