DearResidents, Businesses andTaxpayers
ofFramingham, 
Iampleased topresent myannual report
asTownManager forcalendaryear2016. 
TheofficialtaxratefortheTown, 
approved bythe MA Dept. ofRevenue
this past November 2016, represents the
thirdandfinalyearofathree-yearbudget
plan with agoal ofusing aportion of
projected group health insurance savings
toreduce the property taxburden in
Framingham. 
Many ofyouareprobably aware that state
lawallows thetotal property taxlevy to
increasebynotmorethan2.5% fromyear
to year. This is the customary increase in
total taxes thatsustains our ability to
provide municipal services to
Framingham residents andbusinesses. In
establishing thegoal ofsharing a
substantial portion ofourexpected health
insurance savings withtaxpayers, Iam
pleased toreport that thiskept those
annual increases inthetotal taxlevywell
belowthatannual2.5% maximum. 
Specifically, inFY2015, thelevyincreased
byonly1.05%;followed by0.65% inFY
2016, andfinally1.75% inthiscurrent
year. Inother words, the total levy
increase ofthethree years was limited to
3.45% ratherthanthe7.5% increase
customarily allowed. Thisresults inatotal
three-year savings tothe average
residential taxpayer inFramingham of
morethan $800. 
Wewere also abletomoderate theextent
towhich weshifttheproperty taxburden
from residential taxpayers onto 
commercial taxpayers. Thislowers the
high tax burden onbusinesses in
Framingham andhascreated auseful tool
inthefuturetoavoidorlimittheimpacts
ofsudden declines incommercial values
thatsuddenly shift thetaxburden back
onto residential taxpayers. Lastly, wehave
createda $4,000,000CapitalProjects
Stabilization Fund thatwillhelp fund a
portionofanewmiddleschoollikelyto
beconstructed assoonas2019. 
Thepastyearhasseenfurtherprogressin
implementing ourdevelopment vision for
DowntownFramingham. Bytheendof
theyear there were two emerging
residential development proposals under
new residential zoning intheCentral
Business District. Also, significant is the
substantial completion oftheDowntown
RoadwayandStreetscapeproject. This
progress bodes well forexciting
developments in2017. 
The Town hasbeen fortunate enough to
beinvited intotheMassachusetts School
SchoolConstructionGrantProgram. The
invitation setsinmotion averydetailed
process ofevaluating options tobuild a
much-needed middle school in
Framingham one that willlikely replace
theagingFullerMiddleSchool. The
invitation sets thestage fortheMSBA
reimbursing thetownanestimated 57% 
ofapproved construction costs forthe
newschool. Thefinalreimbursement rate
willbeknown when afinal acceptance of
approved.

Ofthose lowlevel offenders whohad

afurther 128individuals were diverted

Program continues tobeheld upasabest

acrosstheCommonwealth. 
During the spring of2016, inresponse to
theopioid epidemic, members ofthe
Framingham Jail Diversion Program
launchedthe ‘Framingham

The primary goalofFramingham CARES
istoreduce thenumber and frequency of

Framingham community. Thisinitiative
hasbeen developed torespond to

SnowandIceManagementProgram
Snow and iceoperations areone ofthe
most important public safety
responsibilities. Noactivityperformedby
aTown has more uncontrollable factors
oramore immediate impact onthe
community than theproper handling of
snow andiceevents. Factors including
temperature, weather, rateofsnowfall, 
amount ofsnowfall, duration ofthestorm

beconsidered; theirimpactonresources
andcosts, including manpower, 
equipment and materials must be
appropriately managed. 
The program provides safe roadways and
sidewalks before, during andaftersnow, 
iceandother weather related events. This
effort involves theplowing and treating of
550lanemilesofpublicroadway, 45
municipal parking facilities, 84milesof

The Division fielded requests from
residents toexchange their recycling carts
toalarger size, totaling 524 exchanges, 
drop-offs, or other issues resolved. 
Approximately 6,649permits were sold

generated in2016fortheGeneralFund. 
TheDivision managed thecollection of
refuse andrecycling from over 18,000
stops including thetipping ofover35,000

Curbside recyclables collected totaled
5,196tons. 
InJuly 2016, theDivision assumed

theTowntotheMWRA, whois
responsible forthe transport and
treatment ofwastewater from its 43
membercommunities. 
Capital improvement programs have been
substantially under-funded inrecent
decades, and, as aconsequence, critical
infrastructure hasexperienced ever
increasing incidents offailure. The
infrastructure continued togrow and
expand over time, but the funding did not
keep pace withcapital needs. Asa
consequence, theDivisionwashistorically
engaged solely inperforming unscheduled
maintenance and was unable todevote
resources toperform critical preventative
maintenance tothesystem. Thisis
underscored bytheissuance ofan
Administrative Consent Order (ACO) and
Notice ofNoncompliance bythe
Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection (MADEP) 
during 2007. The ACO requires the Town
toundertake major sewer construction
and rehabilitation projects over several
yearswiththeprimaryfocusofalleviating
reoccurring sanitary seweroverflows, that
areaaviolation ofStateandFederal law. 
The last specifically identified project
from theACO was completed on
schedule before the end of2013. The 
Inrecent years, aprofessional and
knowledgeable workforce has been
developed. Thishasprovided an
opportunity toidentify andfullycarry out
capitalprojectsoflimitedscopefrom

house staff. This practice not only
provides theTown with asignificant cost
savings over contracting forthese
services, butisusedasatoolfor

2016, wepurchased awater bypass system
thatallowedourin-housestafftoperform
larger water main projects than in
previous years, essentially doubling the
amount ofpipetheDivision installed in
2015. This year, approximately 5,000 feet
ofwater and/orwastewater infrastructure
was replaced using thisapproach onAvon
Street, Campbell Road, Ellis Street, 
Edwards Street, Hampshire Road and
Meadow Street. Inaddition, theDivision
performed asignificant amount ofwork at
16ofour wastewater pump stations
including: equipment upgrades, painting, 
andbothpumpandvalvereplacements. 
TheDivision also faces thecontinuing
challenges ofmanaging asecond
Administrative Order originally issued by
theMWRA in2003. The MWRA
Settlement Agreement limits thelevel of
sulfide that theTown isauthorized to
discharge totheMWRA system through
operational efforts. Sulfide generation can
cause odor andcorrosion problems in
Public Works178
Page 190
sewers that sometimes can be
catastrophic. Activities performed to
mitigate thegeneration ofsulfide include: 
chemical dosing atselected wastewater
pumping stations; targeted collection
system cleaning andinspection; and
enforcement ofgrease interceptor
requirements atfoodestablishments. A
majorcauseofsulfideisthewastewater
detention time associated with large
numbers ofpumping stations and miles of
associated sewerforcemainpiping. 
During the past fiveyears, the number of
pumping stations has been reduced from
50to43aspartofthecapitalprogram. 
Inaddition toconstruction activities, 
excavations required forrepair ofover

SPECIALEDUCATION
The Department ofSpecial Education
provides abroad array ofservices for
students identified with disabilities from
the ages ofthree through twenty-
two. Thereferral, evaluation and
placement procedures aregoverned by
state andfederal special education laws
andregulations, namely, TheIndividuals
with Disabilities Education Act
IDEA). Framingham PublicSchoolsis
committed tothegoal ofproviding an
appropriate education forstudents with
special needs inthe least restrictive
setting. 
Thefollowing programs and services are

There areforty-onesubstantially separate

students require comprehensive
programming which isprovided outside
ofthegeneral education classroom for
more than 60% of the school day. These
classrooms are located atsixofour

Framingham continues toseeanincrease
inthenumber ofchildren with Autism

GovernmentStudyCommittee
In2016 theGovernment Study
Committee (GSC) was an important
participant in the city vs. town debate. It 
questioned candidates running forCharter
Commission andpublished theanswers in
theMetroWest Daily News andlater it
was instrumental inTown Meeting
members adopting aResolution rejecting
theproposed citycharter. 
On asecond try, the GSC was successful
inconvincing Town Meeting toreduce its
membership from216to162overa3- 
year period. Italsowassuccessful in
having Town Meeting adopt abylaw
designed tomake transparent anyfinancial
conflicts ofinterest byTown Meeting
Members andprevent them from voting
onmattersinwhichtheyhavesucha
conflict. Inaddition, theGSC succeeded
inincreasing thenumber oftown meeting
members that constitute aquorum for
doing business fromeighty toamajority
ofthose serving asTown Meeting
members. 
The Government Study Committee
successfully convinced Town Meeting
Members torepeal theunenforceable sex
offender bylaw asbeing unconstitutional
and reported onseveral other warrant
articlesbroughtbeforeTownMeeting. 
Not allreforms proposed bytheGSC
weresuccessful. Itsproposal toestablish a

The Standing Committee onPublic
Works (SCPW) advises fellow Town
Meeting Members onmatters involving
the Public Works Divisionandthe Capital
Projects andFacilities Division. In2016- 
2017, SCPW metwith Public Works
before theAnnual, FallandtwoSpecial
Town Meetings tolearn anddiscuss the
details ofthevarious highway, waterand
sewer projects necessary tokeep the
Town operating aswell asitdoes. SCPW
thenmade informed recommendations to
TownMeetingonthesearticles. 
This past year, the final phase of
recyclables and trash collection was
implemented. PublicWorksnolonger
contracts outtheseservices; rather itisall
donebyTownemployees. Thisallows
collection ofrecyclables every week
instead oftheconfusing every-other-week
schedule. Emptying binswiththe
mechanical arms onthetrucks provides a
much safer working environment for
collectors. Thisalsosavestimeandlabor, 
while providing asignificant cost savings
totheTown.

Over the last several years, residents have
endured many inconveniences associated
with reconstruction ofourwater and
sewerinfrastructure. WhileFramingham
experienced explosive growth from the
intohow these systems should work ona
town-wide basis. The existing system was
neglected, leaving century-oldpipesin
service. PublicWorkshashadtoredesign
thisinfrastructure, allowingremovalof
many sewage pumping stations. Ithas
been athorough job, and the SCPW
commends Public Works onthis huge
effort. Residents can finally look forward
tomostofthemajorinconveniences
winding down after this coming year. In
the end, Framingham will have amuch
morereliableandmaintainable (
infrastructure. 
Ofcontinuing concern isthecondition of
roads within theTown. Like most
communities across thecountry, road
maintenance isdifficulttogetaheadof. 
Public Works does agood job of
coordinating road reconstruction with
their infrastructure work, commercial
utility work, and state funding. 
The next setofchallenges thatPublic
Works hasbegun implementing isthe
management ofstorm water. This is
generally verycostly, butitismandated by
state and federal laws. The final result of
this effort, along with the efforts ofother
communities, iscleaner lakes, ponds and
