tightbudgeting, ahealthy freecashbalance
health insurance totheState Group Insurance
Commission (GIC).We expect these financial
benefits tocontinue intothenext fewyears

TheTown experienced significant amounts of
economic development throughout theyear.

Thevacant Breyers Ice Creamplanton Old

redevelopment andattheendoftheyear, 
demolition oftheoldplant had begun with
construction ofanewfacility scheduled to

Astheyear came toaclose, anew restaurant
intheolddowntown trainstation, theDeluxe
Depot Diner, was completing substantial
renovations and wasplanning itsgrand
opening. Thisrestaurant willjoinanumber of
othernewrestaurants inthedowntown area. 
Along with the new, we also celebrated the

state-funded downtown roadway and
streetscape improvement project got 
underway during theyearand willcontinue
throughout 2015. The project will improve
trafficflowandpedestrian accessibility. Itwill

Additional traffic calming improvements are

and Beaver Streets. TheBoard also adopted a
complete streets policy forthetown which
encourages designers toconsider providing
foralltypes ofroadway users including motor
vehicles, bicyclists andpedestrians. Such a
program isencouraged bythestate which
ultimately rewards participating communities
withgrants. 
The state-funded bridge replacement and/or

TheFramingham JDPprogram (operating
since 2003) partners their clinicians from
Advocates Inc. with officers from the
Framingham PoliceDepartment. The
primary goal oftheprogram istore-direct
appropriate non-violent offenders outof
thecriminal justice system and into
community andanappropriate mental
health/substance abusetreatment).
There were 950psychiatric assessments
referred totheFramingham JDP during 
2014. Thereareasignificantnumberof
personswithamentalillnesseachmonth
that theFramingham officers recommend
fordiversion toacommunity based
mental health treatment. During 2014, 105
unnecessary arrests were diverted by
Framingham JDP. Asecondary outcome
on-scene assessments isdiversion from
costlyadmissionstohospitalE.R.s. 
Without immediate access totrained
clinicians, policeofficers oftenchoose to
direct theindividual totheFramingham
E.R. foranassessment (usuallyby
ambulance). The76diversions fromthe
Framingham E.R. resulted fromtheon- 
sceneJDPresponse. Research showsthat
having trained clinicians accompanying
officers oncallsinvolving individuals with
amental illness, makes good fiscal sense.

The purpose ofthis program isto
promote, preserve, andenhance theshade
tree environment ofthe community
through the application ofbest 
management practices and public
education campaigns. TheTownof
Framingham wasnamed aTreeCity USA
againin2014forthe23rdconsecutive year. 
The Divisionalsoplansanannual Arbor

AnnualArborDaycelebration. 
TheHighway Division oversees the
that ispermitted annually bythe
Massachusetts Department ofAgricultural
ResourcesPesticideBureau. This
program allows theDepartment toapply
best management practices forthecontrol
ofcurbside vegetation thatotherwise
would grow uncontrollably and require
the commitment ofsubstantial and
sustained labor tocontrol unwanted
growth. 
Aprimary and recurring function ofthis
operating group isthe statutory
requirement tomaintain minimum
clearance over the550lanemile roadway
network. In 2014, 38 miles ofpruning
were completed toprovide clearance and
while providing agreat public amenity to
the Town, require routine maintenance so
that they donotalsobecome apublic
liability. The treecrew performs monthly
surveys todetermine hazardous trees and
diseases and takes corrective action to
minimize damage and response during
severe weather events. TheDivision is
responsible forthecleanup and removal
ofstormdebris.

During the winter of2014, theDivision
was faced with many challenges asaresult
ofaseriesofwinterstormsdelivering
heavy amounts ofsnowfall inashort

between events, theDivision stood strong
through the unfavorable conditions
striving todeliver theexpected level of
serviceonbothplowroutesandcurbside

Thiscontinues tobeavaluable tool for
the Town tomaintain contractor
accountability ensuring theproper delivery
ofservicehasbeenperformed. 
The Division works aggressively to
research anddevelop new techniques in
managing waste that cut costs, improve
recyclingprograms. Someofthese
approaches included: 
Developing Phase IIoftheDivisions
Transition toAutomation (Curbside
SolidWasteandRecycling Collection).
Phase IIincludes modernizing theway
curbside refuse iscollected shifting
from adangerous manual collection

with carts on the curb). This will
enable thedepartment toacquire the
necessary equipment toassume the
duties ofcurbside recycling program

helped to reduce disposal cost, raised
additional revenues fortheTown, and
created afull circle recycling loop. In
addition, these materials havebeen

TheDivision has provided these
materials forvarious Town projects

WATERANDWASTEWATER
MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
The Water andWastewater Program is
responsible fortheprovision ofadrinking
water supply, afiresuppression service, 
and asewer collection service tothe
70,000residents ofthecommunity that it
serves. 
TheWater Department isresponsible for
thedistribution ofapublic potable water
supply and fortheprovision offire
suppression service tothe 17,000
residential and commercial accounts
withinthecommunity. Theaverage daily
water demand ofnearly seven million
gallons per day (mgd) ispurchased from 
theMassachusetts Water Resources
Authority (MWRA) andissubsequently
distributed throughout the Town by
meansofacomplicated systemofpumps, 
pipes, valves, and reservoirs. TheWater
Department program provides forthe
maintenance and repair tothewater
distribution infrastructure thatincludes: 
250 miles ofpipe, 17,000 service
connections, 2,000hydrants, 4,800gate
valves, 22,000meters, 4pumping stations, 
3booster stations, and6above ground
water tanks having astorage capacity of
nearly9milliongallons. 
The Wastewater Department is
responsible forthecollection and
transport of5-10million gallons of
sewage each day. Asignificant portion of
wastewater flow during peak periods is
infiltration andinflow (I/I) from sources
suchasleakingpipesandsumppump

consequence, thecriticalinfrastructure has
experienced ever increasing incidents of

expand over time, but the funding for the
aging andexpanding infrastructure didnot
keep pace withcapital needs. Asa
consequence, theDivisionwashistorically
engaged solely inperforming unscheduled
maintenance and was unable todevote
resources toperform critical maintenance
tothesystem. This isunderscored bythe
issuance ofanAdministrative Consent

requires theTown toundertake major
sewer construction and rehabilitation
projects over several years with the
primary focus ofalleviating reoccurring
sanitary seweroverflows, aviolation of
StateandFederallaw. Thelastspecifically
identified project from theACO was
completed onschedule before theend of
2013. The ACO included several other
requirements including increased staffing
levels, major equipment purchases, 
implementation ofaSCADA system to
remotely monitor and control pumping
stations andstrictreporting requirements. 
TheDepartment is

whichwilllikelyresultinadditional

TheDepartment alsofaces thecontinuing
challenges ofmanaging asecond
Administrative Order originally issued by
theMassachusetts Water Resources
Authority in2003. The MWRA
Settlement Agreement limits thelevel of
sulfide that theTown isauthorized to
discharge totheMWRA system through
operational efforts. Sulfide generation can
cause odor andcorrosion problems in
sewers, which sometimes canbe
catastrophic. Activitieswhichthe
Wastewater Department performs to
mitigatethegeneration ofsulfideinclude: 
chemical dosing atselected wastewater
pumping stations, targeted collection
systemcleaning andinspection, and
enforcement ofgrease interceptor
requirements atfoodestablishments. A

Department hasreduced thenumber of
pumping stations during thepast three 
yearsfrom50to44aspartofitscapital

Inrecent years, the Department ofPublic
Works hasdeveloped aprofessional and
knowledgeable workforce atalllevels and
disciplines. Thisprogression hasprovided
anopportunity toidentify and fullycarry
outcapital projects oflimited scope from
design through construction using Public
Works staff. This practice not only
provides theTown with asignificant cost
savings over contracting forthese
services, butisusedasatoolfor

SCHOOLCOMMITTEE
FiscalYear2015Budget
The School Committee began the budget
process by taking into account projected
revenues, expected levelsofstateand
federal funding, and increased expenses
due to Special Education and rising
enrollment. We were also committed to
ensuring that allschools will have the
necessary resources to support
consistently high academic performance
and achievement for all students.With
theseconsiderations, ourinitialbudgetfor
theschooldepartment was$110,685,437. 
On April 16, the Committee voted to
submitarevised budgetof $109,368,801. 
This sum wouldinclude monies to
support increased student achievement
and to continue the rebuilding efforts
necessaryafterbudgetcutsinprioryears. 
In late May, Town Meetingapproveda
FY’15budget appropriation of
109,368,801, which included allocations
for rebuilding(additional technologies), 
theopening ofaninth elementary school

theadditionofassistant principals. The
latter werenecessary toensure compliance
with the new supervision and evaluation
procedures mandated by the Department
ofElementary andSecondary Education.
