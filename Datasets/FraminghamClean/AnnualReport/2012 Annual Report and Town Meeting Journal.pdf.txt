Annual Report
January 1, 2012 -  December 31, 2012
Framingham's Town Seal: In the year 1900, the Framingham Town Seal was redesigned
for the Town's bicentennial to recognize the community's prominence in education and
transportation. The Framingham State Normal School, a free public school and the first of
its kind in America, is represented by the structure at the top of the design. Governor
Danforth, the founder of Framingham and owner of much of its land, is acknowledged by
the words "Danforth's Farms 1662" on the shield in the center. The wheel with spokes
drawn as tracks radiating in six different directions represents the steam and electric railroads
and signifies the Town's position as a transportation hub. Surrounding the words "Town of
Framingham Incorporated 1700" is an illustrative border of straw braid, which honors the
prominent role Framingham played in the manufacture of hats and bonnets in the 1800s.

Board of Selectmen took a number of
significant actions during 2012 that had
many positive impacts on the Town. Most
significantly, the board hired Robert
Halpin as the new Town Manager. Mr.
Halpin, with a  strong background in
Town management and economic
development, began work in June, taking
over from Interim Town Manager Valerie
Mulvey. This was the second time Ms.
Mulvey filled in as interim manager for the
Town, and once again served the Town in
an exemplary manner. 
At the beginning of the year and as part of
the budget setting process for Fiscal Year
2013, the Board of Selectmen took the
unprecedented step of recommending a
Town budget that would require only a 1
z% levy increase instead of the allowed 2
1 /2 %  annual increase. This
recommendation was approved by Town
Meeting and resulted in a much -welcomed
reduced real estate tax impact for property
owners. It was the first time since
Proposition 221 /was approved in 1980
that the Town took such a step.
General Government  I

Town of Framingham
Early in the year, the Board completed
negotiations with TJX and brought to a
Special Town Meeting a  20 -year tax
increment financing package ( TIF) that
insures the continued presence of TJX in
Framingham for years to come. The
agreement requires TJX to maintain their
headquarters in Framingham, create new
jobs, and develop new facilities.
On the heels of the TIF approval, the
Board solicited proposals for the
sale /reuse of the Jonathan Maynard
School Building in Framingham Center.
The Danforth Museum was the only party
to submit a proposal and by the end of
the year, following extensive negotiations,
an agreement was reached that would
have the Museum purchase the Maynard
Building and complete relocation to the
site by the end of 2015. Approval by
Town Meeting will be sought at the
Annual Town Meeting in 2013.
After a lengthy public hearing process by
the Board of Health, General Chemical
decided that they would no longer seek to
renew their site assignment license and
announced that they would cease
operations on Leland Street. An extensive
site clean -up plan was prepared and
cleanup of the property began during the
year.
The Selectmen approved permits to allow
the Framingham History Center to host a
weekend Civil War encampment on the
Framingham Center Common as part of
the Town's celebration of the 150th
anniversary of the Civil War. The event
was very well attended and included
appearances by President Abe Lincoln and
General George Gordon, a local Civil War
hero.
In October, representatives from the
MWRA and MassDEP joined Town
officials, members of the Town's
General Government 
2012 Annual Town Report
legislative delegation and neighbors at the
Weston Aqueduct on Elm Street to cut a
ribbon formally opening a section of the
aqueduct for use as a passive walking trail.
This was the first time a section of state -
owned aqueducts was permitted for public
use as a walking trail.
During a single week in October, the
Town received back -to- back -to -back great
news from the State. Governor Deval
Patrick visited Mass Bay Community
College at the campus in the former
Farley School and announced a $ 22M
grant to enable the college to purchase
property and expand their presence in
Downtown Framingham. This
announcement was followed by
notification from the State that they have
agreed to a $4.2M match for a new branch
library. As if this wasn't enough, Lt.
Governor Tim Murray visited Downtown
Framingham at the end of the week with a
team of State Transportation officials and
announced that the State would match
federal funds with State money for the
Town's Downtown revitalization project
as well as support of the Route 126/135
intersection improvements.
During an otherwise quiet week in May,
NSTAR tree crews invaded the Oaks
neighborhood and began a  non -stop
onslaught of tree cutting along its
transmission line right -of -way through
Reardon Park and along Brownlea and
Lake Roads. The Town Manager and
Selectmen, together with Tree Warden
Daniel Nau, quickly organized several
meetings in the field with NSTAR and
residents and within a week had convened
a well- attended public meeting at Town
Hall. A follow -up meeting with officials
from several abutting communities was
also held and NSTAR eventually agreed to
changes in their procedures and mitigate
some of the damage that was caused.

In June, the Town was saddened to learn
of the sudden passing of well -liked Town
Meeting Moderator Ed Noonan. At the
request of Town Meeting, Selectmen
agreed to appoint an interim moderator
until the annual election in April, 2013.
Among other actions taken during the
year, the Selectmen reinstituted a unified
code enforcement task force made up of
representatives from police, fire, health,
public works, and building departments.
The goal of the group is to upgrade
neighborhoods by identifying local
building and safety by -law violations
through comprehensive deployment and
follow -up with property owners to ensure
compliance.
Also during the year, the Town
successfully negotiated a five -year contract
for disposal of trash, which will save the
Town over $2M.

start date was the culmination of six ( 6)
months of preparation and work to
become familiar with Framingham and its
priorities on my part, and of more than a
year of effort on the part of the Screening
Committee and the Board of Selectmen in
managing the recruitment and selection
process. I would like to begin this report
with a sincere thank you for the work they
put into that process 
and for the
confidence they have placed in me in
selecting me as your Town Manager. 
2012 Annual Town Report
We were very pleased to learn that Money
Magazine named Framingham the "36th
Best Place to Live" in the Nation. The
article cited the Town's diversity,
affordable housing and a " sweet" job
market as some of the reasons for the
recognition.
The members of the Board and I wish to
thank all of the Town's employees and
hundreds of volunteers for their hard
work and continued dedication. We are
very fortunate to have such an incredible
group of people who work every day to
make Framingham such a great place to
live, work and raise a family.
Respectfully submitted,
Framingham Board of Selectmen

In June we determined that the Lexington
Street Parking Garage adjacent to the
main branch of the Framingham Public
Library had suffered severe structural
deterioration stemming from age and
from the use of deicing agents over the
years. A recommendation was presented
and approved by the fall Special Town
Meeting to demolish the structure and to
replace it with landscaped surface parking
to serve the Library. The project will take
place in the spring of 2013.
A longstanding priority of the Board of
Selectmen is to enter into a performance
based energy services contract to reduce
the energy costs of municipal and school
buildings. The Town Manager and
General Government  3

Town of Framingham
Selectmen took an important first step in
the fall of 2012 and will present a
proposed contract to Annual Town
Meeting. This type of contract is
increasingly common among governments
and institutional owners with large energy
needs. Thecontractor identifies alistof
energy efficiency investments and
projected savings, which the owner
finances. The contractorimplements and
manages the project over its life span, and,
in the process, guarantees the minimum
savings in the contract to assure the
payback period in the contract is met.
The energy services contract will play a
central role in the Town's efforts to
become certified as a  Massachusetts
Green Community' intheyear ahead. To
become certified the Town must meet five
5) criteria, one of which is to reduce the
energy consumption of the municipal and
school operations by at least 20% over the
nextfive (5) years. Othercriteria include
at least one location in Town providing
as -of -right zoning and permitting for a
renewable energy facility; adoption of the
Automobile Fuel Efficiency policy; and
adoption of the Stretch Energy Efficiency
Building Code. The Town hopes to have
these actions and plans in place by
October 2013, the next period in which to
seek certification.
The absence of a Long Range Municipal
Building Plan has long been considered a
significant impediment to obtaining Town
Meeting approval for significant repairs
andinvestments inmunicipal buildings. I
directed the Capital Projects Manager and
the Facilities Management Director to
begin preparing such a  comprehensive
plan during 2012. The plan will follow the
format of the School Department's long
range building plan for easy integration
and understanding of the complete Town
requirements for buildings over the next
twenty (20) years.
General Government 
2012 Annual Town Report
The Mass Department of Transportation
conducted an all- important 25% Design
Plan public hearing on proposed traffic
and streetscape improvements in
Downtown Framingham. The project is
now expected to proceed to final design
and bid documents in 2013 with $8.0
million in improvements expected to
begin in2014. The project will improve
the flow of traffic through Downtown,
but also represent a major improvement
in the sidewalks and streetscape.
Town officials met several times with state
transportation officials in preparation of
construction at two (2) bridges on Winter
St. in 2013. The bridge over the Sudbury
River will begin in summer of 2013 and
the bridge over the CSX tracks will begin
construction shortly thereafter in the fall
of2013. These projects run the risk of
creating severe traffic impacts unless MA
DOT implements effective traffic
management measures and contracts with
performance incentives to complete the
projects on time and without delay.
The Mass Department of Environmental
Protection officially approved closure
plans for General Chemical' s toxics
transfer facility on Leland Street. The
facility ceased operation during the
summer of2013. The Framingham Board
of Health played an important role in
bringingthese operations to an end. The
emphasis now shifts toward completing a
more comprehensive evaluation of
contamination at the site and overseeing
the company's post closure remediation
plan.
The Town achieved a major financial goal
during 2012. After a multiyear effort, the
Town's Stabilization Fund was funded at a
level that represents 5% of its general
fund expenditures. This is  a  major
accomplishment, particularly in light of it
4
Page 17
Town of Framingham
having been carried out during a period of
significantbudgetconstraints. Thework
was recognized by Moody's Investment
Services, which awarded the Town the
second highest bond rating available,
thereby lowering our overall borrowing
costs.
An independent consultant completed an
Operational Review of the Town's
Assessing practices in light of the major
shifts in tax burden between various
classes of taxable property that occurred
inFY2012. The review concluded that
there was no single mistake or error which
caused the shifts and otherwise found that
the values in various classes of tax value
did represent full and fair market value.
The report did, however, makes a variety
of recommendations for improving
assessment practices and making the
process more transparent and understood
bytaxpayers. TheAssessors arereporting
periodically to both the Selectmen and the
Town Manager on progress 
in
implementing the recommendations.
Mass Bay Community College announced
that it plans to consolidate two leased
campuses in Framingham and Ashland
into one MetroWest campus to be located
inDowntown Framingham. The college
has been awarded an initial allocation of
funding to pursue the design and location
of a new campus and Town officials are
working closely with the Mass 
2012 Annual Town Report
Department of Capital Asset Management
DCAM) to evaluate the options available
to the college in the Downtown area.
The Board of Selectmen negotiated and
Annual Town Meeting approved a Tax
Increment Finance ( TIF) Agreement with
TJX Companies, which is headquartered
in Framingham. The agreement provides
for TJX to invest millions in their
headquarters in Framingham, and, in
exchange, the Town agreed to exempt a
portion of the increased property taxes
that will result from that investment for a
fixed period ofyears. The agreement also
allowed TJX to seek state approval for a
significant state sponsored investment tax
credit to be applied against state taxes.
Needless to say, Framingham is proud to
serve as the home of TJX and looks
forward to it being part of the community
for years to come.
In closing, I  want to acknowledge the
work of Town Clerk Valerie Mulvey
during her time as Interim Town Manager
and her assistance to me during my entry
intotheposition lastsummer. Iamalso
thankful for the hard work and assistance
of my office staff and the Town's overall
management team in  making this
transition as smooth as possible.
Respectfully submitted,
Robert Halpin
Town Manager
Framingham is the 14th most populated
municipality in Massachusetts. A total of
68,318 residents were counted in the 2010
US Census. Of that amount, 36,957
Framingham residents are registered to
vote. The presence of a birthing hospital,
numerous nursing homes and assisted
General Government 
living facilities contribute to  our
substantial work load.
Assistant Town Clerk Lisa Ferguson
manages our daily operations and trains
and supervises staff. In the absence of the
Town Clerk, the Assistant Town Clerk
assumes the authority and responsibilities
5
Page 18

of that position. Ms. Ferguson directed
the Town Clerk and Elections Divisions
in 2012 from January through May while I
served as 
Interim Town Manager.
Operations ran smoothly, efficiently and
flawlessly.
The Town Clerk Division is responsible
for creating and preserving all the Town's
vital records. Administrators Emily Black
and Elena Finehouse registered 575
deaths, 526 marriages and issued 3612 dog
licenses and 555 business certificates in
2012. Our revenue total was $233,044.
Other responsibilities include: issuing
underground storage tank permits;
collecting fines for the Board of Health,
Conservation Commission, Police
Department, Building and Public Works
Departments, and Animal Control;
maintaining all permanent Public Way
Access permits, Zoning Board of Appeals,
Planning Board, and Historic Commission
decisions and appeals; conducting
genealogy searches and issuing raffle
permits. One administrator is  also
responsible for processing affidavits of
correction of vital records, posting
meetings and agendas and ensuring that
the 48 -hour requirement is met, recording
Conflict of Interest receipts and
registering births. As a result of the Vitals
Information Partnership System we now
receive all births to Framingham residents
electronically. This has doubled the time
necessary for the process. In 2012, 914
births at MWMC were registered and 482
out -of -town births were processed for a
total of 1396 births to Framingham
residents.
Lauren DiGiandomenico is the Election
Coordinator. The Election Division is
responsible for: conducting elections and
the Annual Town Census; maintaining the
Town's voter /census database and its
related street listing; recording Town
Meeting votes, filing Town Meeting
General Government 
2012 Annual Town Report
original documents, preparing the
Attorney General Bylaw submissions and
posting the bylaws when they are
approved. The Annual Town Meeting met
over thirteen nights in April and May.
Four Special Town Meetings were held on
March 14, May 22, September 10 and,
October 16.
In 2012, Ms. DiGiandomenico registered
5010 new voters, deleted 2577 voters and
amended the records of 15369 voters. She
processed 3682 absentee ballots -448 for
the Presidential Primary, 359 for the
Town Election, 436 for the State Primary
and 2618 for the Presidential Election.
Four elections were held in 2012 with
14% voting in the Presidential Primary,
10% in the Town Election, 11% in the
State Primary, and 76% ( almost 28,000
people) in the Presidential Election. We
are grateful to the many people for
assisting us in providing excellent service
to our voters. These include but are not
limited to: School Superintendents
Hiersche and Lynch who scheduled
professional development on November
6, which significantly decreased traffic,
increased parking and eliminated concerns
for student safety; Superintendents Scott
and Lynch who provide accessible voting
locations at their schools and the
principals who loan us their cafeterias,
gyms and parking spaces on election day;
Eric Heideman and Town Facilities
Management staff, Matt Torti and School
Building and Grounds staff, Dom Jannetti
and Keefe Facilities staff, and Chris
McGinty and Parks and Recreation
seasonal employees who set up, break
down, and maintain the polling locations;

election day and our election workers who
work 15+ hour days to serve the voters.
The Board of Selectmen, Town
employees, Town Officials, the Town
Moderator and Town Meeting Members
provide consistent support to this office.
It is a pleasure to work with them and
with all who participate in  our
administration and government. This year
the Senior Tax Relief Program provided
us with the much needed assistance of
Janet Martin.
I am very grateful for the support of our
dedicated, knowledgeable Division and
Department Heads who facilitated my
tenure as Interim Town Manager and
provided a smooth transition for Town
Manager Bob Halpin. It is a privilege to
call them my colleagues. Finally and most
importantly I  thank and commend my
small dedicated staff for their hard work,
professionalism and knowledgeable,
friendly attitudes. They exemplify the
Town' s commitment to  excellent
customer service.

v. Framingham 
TYPE
Contract 
2012/2013 STATUS/DISPOSITION
This case concerns a suit by Boston Properties to recover
175,000 in funds from a failed development near Mass Pike Exit
12. Under a 1999 development covenant executed by Boston
Properties, it agreed to provide $350,000 to the Town provided
that certain contingencies occurred, namely the issuance of certain

permitsforthedevelopment. Thedevelopment failedandBoston
Properties is now seeking this money back, claiming the
contingencies neveroccurred. Thedispute centers onwhetherthe
contingencies occurred ordidnotoccur. The Town's positionis
that the contingencies occurred based on certain site preparation
and demolition that occurred on the property (which required a
building permit),as well as the moving of the historic Rugg -Gates
House. Both parties have filed cross -motions for summary
judgment, and are awaiting a decision by the Court.
This case involves a certiorari appeal under G.L. c. 249, §4 by the
plaintiff, Thomas Corrado, of the Conservation Commission's
issuance of a determination of applicability (the "Determination of
Applicability ")in which it found that the Property contains
wetlands subject to the Bylaw and the Wetlands Protection Act.
The Determination further required that Mr. Corrado provide a full
and accurate wetland delineation plan, bring the Property into
compliance with pertinent wetlands laws and regulations, secure
proper review, approval and permitting to conduct future activities
at the Property, and comply with an enforcement order that the
Commission issued on November 19, 2008 determining that the
plaintiff undertook unpermitted filling, tree cutting and grading
activity on the Property in an Area Subject to Protection in
violation ofthe Bylaw. The Commission filed a counterclaim
seeking an injunction requiring the plaintiff s compliance with the
enforcement order. On November 10, 2010, the parties filed a
stipulation of dismissal whereby the plaintiff withdrew his appeal
with prejudice, thereby affirming the terms of the Determination
of Applicability. Subsequently, on January 19, 2011, the
Commission issued a further enforcement order that superseded
the first to address new and presently existing violations at the
Property. In August of 2011, the Commission filed an amended
counterclaim to request an order requiring Mr. Corrado's
compliance withthe Second Enforcement Order. The
Commission filed a motion for summary judgment as to its
counterclaim in 2012. On December 31, 2012, the Superior Court
issued judgment in favor of the Commission as to its counterclaim.
The Board of Selectmen recently approved the filing of a contempt
action to compel Mr. Corrado's compliance with the Judgment and
January 19, 2011 enforcement order.
This case involves an appeal challenging the Planning Board's
July 2012 decision denying the plaintiffs' application for
endorsement of approval not required (ANR) under the
Subdivision Control Law with respect to property located at 1147
Edmands Road. The Planning Board filed an answerin August,
2012. The Planning Board intends to conductdiscovery in 2013.

This case involves a challenge by CSE, the current developer of
the Danforth PUD (successor to Pulte Homes and before Pulte,
National Development of New England),of the Conservation
Commission's January 6, 2010 vote denying CSE's application to
perform certain work in the wetlands area in connection with its
proposed development project located at Riverpath Drive. In its
denial order, the Commission found that CSE had failed to provide
minimum fundamental information and materials necessary to
enabletheCommission toapproveanorderofconditions. CSE
filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which the Town
opposed. In December of 2011, the Superior Court issued an
order and written decision denying CSE's motion and dismissed
the case. After initially appealing the Court's ruling tothe
Appeals Court, CSE withdrew its appeal the Court issued a notice
of final dismissal on May 30, 2012. This matter is now closed.
This case involves an appeal by Christopher Dangelo challenging
the Framingham Fire Department's request to HRD seeking to
bypass Mr. Dangelo for an open firefighter position and requesting
the removal of his name from the community's current eligible list
under the provisions ofPersonnel Administration Rule .09. After
the Town submitted its pre- hearing conference memorandum, the
parties reached a resolution and filed a stipulation of dismissal
with prejudice, with each party to bear their own costs. Mr.
Dangelo granted the Town a full release of claims as part of the
settlement. Thismatterisnowclosed
This case concerned the January 2011 termination of Robert Fish,
who was the Recycling Center Supervisor and a member of DPW
Local 1116. The Union filed a grievance on Mr. Fish's behalf
alleging that the Town terminated Mr. Fish without just cause.
The Union petitioned for the matter to be resolved by arbitration
through the Division of Labor Relations, a state agency that is
authorizedto arbitratepublic employee labor disputes. In July of
2012, after the Union had attempted for several months to contact
Mr. Fish without success, the Union proposed dismissing the
arbitration. Thereafterthepartiesfiled ajoint stipulation of
dismissal. Thismatterisnowclosed.
This case involved a Petition for Certification filed in April of
2012 requesting the accretion of certain non -bargaining unit
positions tothe Public Employee Local Union 1116. In August,
2012 the Town and the Union entered into a side letter of
agreementin which they agreed to revise Article III (Recognition)
of the Local 1116 Collective Bargaining Agreement to incorporate
the accretion of certain positions in negotiations for the next
successor agreement between the parties. Upon the parties' entry
of such side letter of agreement the Union withdrew with prejudice

2012 Annual Town Report
This case involves a petition filed in August, 2010 by the
Framingham Police Officers union to ask the JLMC to exercise
jurisdiction over the parties' negotiation for anew collective
bargaining agreement. Three mediation sessionsbefore JLMC
Mediator Brian Harrington did not yield a settlement and the
parties participated in a formal fact finding arbitration before the
JLMC on February 16, 2012. On June 7, 2012, the JLMC issued
the Arbitration Panel's Award awarding a 3 year agreement
sought by both the Town and the Union) that provided various
concessions to the parties with respect to wages, sick leave,
civilianization andClothes andCleaning Allowances. ThePanel's
decision was subject to approval by Town Meeting of a funding
request tocover the costitems inthe Award. Accordingly, ata
Special Town Meeting commenced on October 16, 2012,
Framingham Town Meeting voted to approve the award.
Following such approval the Town and FPOU commenced
currently pending bargaining for the next successor agreement,
potentially covering FY12 to FY14
The Framingham Police Officers Union (FPOU) filed this unfair
labor practice charge with the Massachusetts Labor Relations
Commission, now the Division of Labor Resources (DLR),
following the Town's issuance of correspondence to the FPOU in
April of 2007 reaffirming the existence of the Town's 24 day work
period pursuant to 29 USC 207(k) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
The FPOU's charge alleged that the Town's correspondence
regarding the existence of the 24 day work period was a change in
working conditions that required bargaining. Following the United
States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit's order affirming
summary judgment in the Town's favor in Calvao, et al. v. Town
of Framingham the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts entered a Consent Judgment confirming the validity
of the Town's 24 day work period for Framingham patrol officers
under 29 U.C. § S. 207(k).Notwithstanding the Consent Judgment
and the First Circuit decision that legally affirmed that the 24 day
work period was effectively established in 1986, the
Commonwealth Employment Relations Board (CERB) issued a
Complaint of Prohibited Practice in 2008 alleging that the Town
improperly failed to bargain under state law in connection with the
Town's implementation of its 24 day work period 22 years earlier.
The DLR held a pre- hearing conference in this matter on July 24,
2012. Following this conference the DLR requested thatthe
parties file memoranda explaining what the remedy could be (if
any) inthis case inview ofthe ConsentJudgment. Theparties
filed responsive memoranda and other related submissions in
August of2012. The DLR has scheduled a hearing in this matter
for October, 2013.

Gagne v.
Framingham
Guzman v. Town of
Framingham 
Discrimination
Labor 
This case concerned a Charge of Discrimination filed against the
Town by a former employee with the MCAD. Position statements
were filed by the parties and a request for withdrawal was filed by
Gagne's counsel shortly before the investigative conference.
MCAD subsequently dismissed thematterwithprejudice. This
matter is now closed unless counsel for the complainant seeks to
reopen it.
This is an action by on behalf of Officer Edwin Guzman, a patrol
officer in the Framingham Police Department, alleging that the
Town failed to pay Officer Guzman so- called Quinn Bill benefits
under G.L. c. 41 § 108L. The dispute concerns whether Officer
Guzman was a "regular full -time member" of a police department
prior to July 1, 2009, which is the statutory cutoff date for Quinn
Bill benefits eligibility under Section 49, Chapter 120 of the Acts
of 2009, an act by the Legislature that effectively ended Quinn Bill
benefits for newly hired police officers going forward after July 1,
2009. Although there is no dispute thatFramingham hired him
subsequent to July 1, 2009, Officer Guzman alleges that he gained
regular full- time" status in connection with his hiring by the
Worcester Police Department and his training at the Worcester
Police Academy, notwithstanding that he was never sworn -in as an
Officer of the Worcester Police Department. On July 16, 2012,
the Town filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In its motion
the Town argued that Officer Guzman's declaratory judgment
action against the Town is precluded as a matter of law because
Officer Guzman failed to pursue arbitration of his claim regarding
Quinn Bill benefits as required under the collective bargaining
agreement between the Town and Guzman's union, the
Framingham Police Officers' Union. The Town further argued
that the complaint must be dismissed as improper under Mass. R.
Civ. P. Rule 19 and G.L. c. 231A, §8 on the grounds that Officer
Guzman failed to join two indispensable parties to this action,
namely the City of Worcester and the Massachusetts Board of
Higher Education. The Court held a hearing on the Town's
motion on October 10, 2012. The parties expect the Court to issue
a decision on the motion in 2013.
Hotyckey v. Chief
Steven Carl,

Licensing 
This case involved the Framingham Police Department's denial of
Scott Hotyckey's application for a renewal of his License to Carry
Firearms ( "LTC "). The FPD notified Hotyckey that his LTC
renewal application was denied on May 30, 2012. Mr. Hotyckey
sought judicial review in the Framingham District Court pursuant
to G.L. c. 140 § 131(f).After the District Court dismissed his
petition, Mr. Hotyckey appealed the ruling to the Superior Court.
On October 31, 2012, the District Court issued an order dismissing
the case without prejudice at the request of the plaintiff upon the
General Government  21

Town's representations that Mr. Hotyckey may receive a firearms
identification card from the Town and that the Chief of Police will
consider, in good faith, any application for a license to carry a
firearm filed by Mr. Hotyckey after April 31, 2014. This matter is
now closed.
This case arises out of the Conservation Commission' s attempt to
enforce wetlands violations at property owned by plaintiffs Roger
and Dawn Levasseur at 49 Gates Street (the "Property ").  The
plaintiffs purchased the Property on or about December 12, 2008
from Leonidas andElaineExarchos. The Levasseurs have alleged
that the violations were committed by the Exharchoses or other
prior owner(s) of the property. The Commission voted to issue an
enforcement order on December 17, 2008, and issued a subsequent
enforcement order (the "Enforcement Order ") on January 7, 2009.
In 2012, the parties negotiated a settlement that requires certain
wetlandsremediation and fully disposes ofthe case. OnFebruary
7, 2013, after the parties had fully executed the settlement
agreement, they jointly filed a joint stipulation of dismissal. This
matter is now closed.
This case involves an appeal by Tristen Ortiz challenging the
Framingham Fire Department's request to HRD seeking to bypass
Ortiz for an open firefighter position and requesting the removal of
his name from the community's current eligible list under the
provisions ofPersonnel Administration Rule .09. A hearing
officer from the Division of Administrative Law Appeals held a
hearing in this matter on January 9, 2013, and is expected to issue
a recommended ruling for vote by the Civil Service Commission
in the coming months.
This is the first of three Paulini lawsuits, and it is has been stayed
by the court pending the outcome of the third lawsuit, which will
be described below. In December of 2005, the Zoning Board of
Appeals denied Paulini Loam's application for a special permit to
construct a concrete batching plant atthe Property. Atthe time of
the initial application, the property was zoned General
Manufacturing. Paulini claimed that the concrete batching plant
was allowed under Section III.l.G.a. of the Zoning Bylaw, which
allows "manufacturing of any description utilizing processes free
from neighborhood disturbing odors and /or other agencies" in the
General Manufacturing district. The Building Commissionerruled
that the proposed use required a special permit under Section
III.2G.as a use "which would be offensive because of injurious or
obnoxious noise, vibration, smoke, gas, fumes, odors, dust or other
objectionable features...." Paulini filed this appeal seeking to
overturn the ZBA's denial of the special permit, and to obtain a
declaration from the Court that the proposed plant did not require
a special permit. There has been extensive discovery, including

depositions, in this case, but it has been stayed by the Court for
several years.
This is the second of three Paulini lawsuits and has also been
stayed by the Land Court. In December of 2005, a Special Town
Meeting approved two amendments to the Zoning By -law, one of
which changed the zoning designation of the area to Office
Professional, such that the proposed use became prohibited and
could not be authorized even through a special permit. The second
amendment changed the procedures and thresholds for site plan
review. Paulini filed this second lawsuit, this time naming the
Town as defendant, challenging the validity of the Zoning By -law
amendments. In the meantime, Paulini filed a definitive
subdivision plan for the Property, which was approved by the
Planning Board, thereby freezing the zoning of the Property for 8
years from the date the subdivision plan was approved. As a result,
the Property is still governed by the General Manufacturing
zoning as it existed in 2005. We filed a motion for summary
judgment on behalf of the Town in this case, arguing that the two
amendments are valid as a matter of law. That motion is still
pending at the Land Court
This case represents the most recent appeal filed by Paulini Loam,
LLC, appealing the Zoning Board's 2009 decision to uphold the
Building Commissioner' s denial of a building permit for the
proposed concrete manufacturing plant. Paulini's complaint
includes two counts: the first is an appeal under G.L. c. 40A §17
ofthe Board's decision, and the second is arequest for a
declaratory judgment that the proposed use of the site for a
concrete manufacturing facility is allowed by right under the
Zoning Bylaw. The Board filed amotion for summaryjudgment
on the grounds that it is not disputed that the plans submitted to
the Building Commissioner showed a structure, within the
meaning of the Zoning Bylaw, within a required setback. On July
19, 2012, the Court issued an order denying the Town's motion on
the basis ofthe Court's determination that there are "genuine
issues of material fact that preclude the granting of summary
judgment,"including with respect to "whether the plant —as
located, designed, and mitigated —will be offensive because of
injurious or obnoxious noise, vibration, dust, or truck traffic."The
Court interpreted the Town Zoning Bylaw to provide that
manufacturing in this [zoning] District may proceed as of right so
long as its processes do not cause offensive, injurious or
obnoxious levels of noise, vibration, dust or `other objectionable
features. "'
Following the Court's issuance of this order the parties have

exchanged discovery requested and attempted to mediate this
matter with REBA Dispute Resolution, Inc. on December 3, 2012.
The parties failed to reach a resolution during the mediation,
however, and recently moved jointly to extend the Court's
discovery schedule. Currently theCourt'sschedule requires the
parties to complete all discovery, including expert depositions, by
May 3, 2013. The Court has scheduled a telephone conference
call status for April 8, 2013.
This is a case filed by Revoli Construction Co.,Inc. against the
Town on February 25, 2011. Revoli seeks claims against the
Town totaling approximately $300,000 for additional
compensation that Revoli alleges is owed by the Town in
connection with Revoli's work on a sewer line replacement project
onandnearWater Street. TheTowndeniesliability andhasfiled
a counterclaim against Revoli for sums expended by the Town in
securing Revoli's correction of its defective installation of a large
segment ofsewer pipe. In 2012 the parties exchanged conducted
discovery and conducted motion practice to determine which of
the Town's documents were subject to protection as privileged.
After Revoli's recent deposition of a Town employee the parties
agreed to pursue mediation. On February 5, 2013, the Court
issued an order extending the discovery deadline and all
subsequent tracking deadlines by 90 days to allow the parties to
pursue mediation. The parties currently have scheduled the
mediation for March 12, 2013.
These two related cases are between the Town and SB General
Contracting, Inc. ( " SB "),the general contractor for the New York
Avenue Utility Corridor Project ( "Project "),a Town public works
project thatwas performedprimarily in2010. The Project
consisted of work on two streets, New York Avenue and
California Avenue, and generally involved replacing existing
sewerforce mains with new larger diameterforce mains. In
March of 2011, SB filed a suit against the Town in Norfolk
Superior Court claiming the Town breached the Project agreement
by failing to pay SB for certain work performed on the Project.
SB alleges $341,021 in damages plus interest, which the Town
disputes. The parties have engagedinwritten discovery andthe
Town filed a motion for partial summary judgment seeking to
dismiss a large number ofSB's claims. The parties tried to
resolve the matter through voluntary mediation, but were unable to
reach agreement primarily due to the assertion against the Town in
April and May of 2012 of third -party claims by a private property
owner and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts alleging that
asbestos -contaminated soils from the Project site were improperly
disposed in a residential area in Milford, MA during the summer
of 2010, with estimated clean -up costs in excess of $900,000. The

property owner also claims unspecified property damages and
other damages. The Commonwealth hasthreatened to seekcivil
fines against the Town for various statutory violations pertaining
totheimproper soil disposal. SB contendsthattherewasan
enforceable settlement of the contract claims from its March 2011
suit which also bar the Town's claims against SB pertaining to the
alleged asbestos disposal, and filed amotion to try to enforce the
settlement. On November 28, 2012, the Court issued orders
denying SB's motion to enforce settlement and the Town's motion
for partial summary judgment.
The Town filed suit against SB in July 2012 in Middlesex
Superior Court for various claims pertaining to the asbestos
disposal issue. The Town recently filed a motion for partial
summary judgment against SB seeking a declaration from the
Court that SB must defend the Town against the claims by the
propertyownerandtheCommonwealth. SBhasasserted
counterclaims against the Town, which the Town has moved to
dismiss. TheCourthas scheduled ahearing onthese motions in
April 2013.
The Town and SB, along with other potentially responsible
parties, are currently involved in pre -suit negotiations under G.L.
c. 21E, § 4Arelated tothe Milford site. Amediation totry to
resolve how to allocate responsibility for the site clean -up is
expected to occur later this year.
This case involves a certiorari appeal under G.L. c. 249, § 4 by the
plaintiff, Gerard Spagnuolo, of the Conservation Commission's
issuance of an enforcement order on December 2, 2009, as
amended bythe Commission in January of2010. The
Commission found that the plaintiff had conducted various
unpermitted activities on property located at 545 Edgell Road
within a wetlands resource area and /or buffer zone in violation of
the Wetlands Protection Bylaw and the Wetlands Protection Act.
The unpermitted activities that the Commission found to have
been undertaken include, among other things, significant cutting,
filling, and grading above and within a steep embankment
resulting in a deposit of boulders and debris in the wetlands),
stockpiling of fill and sediment surrounding several mature trees,
and failure to install erosion controls.
On January 5, 2012 the Land Court entered an order transferring
this case to the Superior Court in accordance with Land Court
precedent holding that the Land Court lacks jurisdiction over
wetlands disputes ofthis nature. At a status conference held on
January 14, 2013, the Superior Court ruled that it will address both

this action and the below related action in a single motion for

Spagnuolo to file his motion for judgment on the pleadings no
later than February 28, 2013.
This case is related to the above action between Mr. Spagnuolo
and the Conservation Commission. On July 7, 2011, Mr.
Spagnuolo filed a certiorari appeal of a further enforcement order
issued by the Commission on or about June 22, 2011, which the
Commission issued upon the discovery of new wetlands
violations. TheCommission removed thecasetoFederal Courtin
view of numerous allegations in Mr. Spagnuolo's complaint
allegingviolations ofFederal statutes. The Federal Court
remanded the case back to the Land Court on October 6, 2011, on
the basis of its determination that Mr. Spagnuolo's allegations
constituted defenses rather than affirmative federal claims.

On January 5, 2012 the Land Court entered an order transferring
this case to the Superior Court on the Town's motion because the
Land Court lacks jurisdiction over wetlands disputes of this nature.
At a status conference held on January 14, 2013, the Superior
Court ruled that it will address both this action and the above
related action in a single motion for judgment on the pleadings
proceeding. The Court directed Mr. Spagnuolo to file his motion
for judgment on the pleadings no later than February 28, 2013.
This case involves a request by Robert Talmo, owner of the
property at 28 Nixon Road, for zoning enforcement with respect to
the abutting property at 30 Nixon Road. Mr. Talmo alleges that a
barn on the property at 30 Nixon Road, which is in a residential
zoning district, is not in compliance with the Zoning Bylaw. The
Board has served discovery requests and responses upon the
plaintiff. On February 10, 2012 the plaintiff filed a motion for
summaryjudgment. The Townfiled its opposition papersin
March 12, 2012. The parties are awaiting the Court's scheduling
of a hearing on the motion.
This case involves a request by the Town Board of Library
Trustees to obtain the Court's permission to remove restrictions on
the Library's use of donated money currently held in two funds,
namely the Moses Edgell Fund and the Library Extension Trust.
The Library wishes to access these funds but cannot do so without
Court permission because the funds were donated for the specific
purpose of maintaining a former Library building that no longer is
in use by the Library. The Attorney General's Office is named as
a necessary party and has endorsed the Complaint in full support
ofthe Town's request. The Town has filed a motion forentry of
judgment on its request and anticipates that the Court will
schedule a hearing on the motion in the spring of 2013.

The Town filed this action in the Framingham District Court on
January 24, 2013, seeking an emergency injunction to require the
property owner to repair a furnace and restore heat to a unit at 22
NipmucTerrace. The Townbroughttheinjunction action after
receiving a complaint and conducting an investigation that the
temperature within the unit in question fell far below minimum
thresholds required underthe State Sanitary Code. The Court
issued injunction orders on January 24 and 25, 2013, requiring the
owner to make the needed repairs and restore adequate heat to the
unitimmediately. The Town has confirmed thattherepairs were
made and that heat was restored as required under the Court's
orders. Thismatterisnowclosed.
This case was filed by Verizon New England Inc. ( "Verizon ") in
May of 2011 against Defelice Corp. ( "Defelice ") and the Town
seeking damages of $48,000 for damage caused by Defelice to a
Verizon cable in 2009 while performing work on a Town project

B. Special Counsel/Insurance Defense Counsel Cases
Below is a list of significant cases that presently are being handled by special counsel or
insurance defense counsel.
MATTER TYPE  STATUS
Charton v. Town of
Framingham 
Employment This case was filed by the Town's former Director of
Human Resources in Middlesex Superior Court in August,
2009 against the Town and the former Town Manager,
alleging constitutional, contract, defamation, emotional
distress and state whistleblower claims in connection with
the Town's termination of the plaintiff's employment in the
spring of2009. The Town's liability insurer,
Massachusetts Interlocal Insurance Association ( MIIA),
has retained insurance counsel to represent the Town and
the former Town Manager, Julian Suso. Certain of Mr.
Charton's claims were dismissed by summary judgment in
March, 2011. In May, 2012 Ms. Charton filed a stipulation
of dismissal as to all remaining claims against the Town,

Carney v. Town of

Otero v. Town of

Law 
and thus the Town is no longer a defendant in this case.
Ms. Charton filed related claims with the Massachusetts
Commission AgainstDiscrimination. Since commencing
this MCAD proceeding, however, Ms. Charton has
dismissed the Town from this proceeding, and therefore
Mr. Suso remains the only defendant in this matter.
Because MIIA has agreed to provide insurance coverage
for Ms. Charton's MCAD claims with no reservation of
rights except as to intentional acts, punitive damages or a
lost wages award in excess of $50,000, financial exposure
to the Town exists only to the extent that MCAD issues
punitive damages, finds that Mr. Suso's acts constitute
intentional discrimination and /or awards Ms. Charton lost
wages for more than $50,000. MCAD commenced a
hearing in this matter on December 3, 2012, and is
expected to issue a decision in the coming months.
In this case Mr. Carney alleged a variety of federal claims and
civil rights violations against the Town in connection with its
enforcement of wetlands violations at property located at and near
32 Parker Road. The Town filed a motion to dismiss Mr. Carney's
amended complaint on January 20, 2012. On April 30, 2012, the
Court issued an order allowing the Town's motion to dismiss.
After initially appealing the Court's order, Mr. Carney promptly
withdrew his appeal. This matteris now closed.
This case concerns a Charge of Discrimination filed against the
Town anditsDepartment ofPublic Works. MIIA hasretained the
firm of Brody, Hardoon, Perkins and Kesten to represent the Town
in this matter. Following the parties' completion of discovery in
2012, the Town filed a summary judgment that remains under
advisement.
This matter involved numerous federal and state court actions
against the Town by a state prison inmate alleging, among other
things, unlawful arrest, conspiracy and assault and battery. The
Federal District Court of Massachusetts dismissed the case with
prejudice in September, 2008. The United States Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit issued an Order on April 23, 2009 directing
the Clerk of Court not to accept any further filings by Mr. Tang in
this matter. Mr. Tang subsequently filed several other lawsuits
against the Town in Superior Court, which filings ultimately
resulted in the Superior Court's issuance of a similar order barring
further state court filings absentpreliminary state approval. Mr.
Tang appealed all or virtually all such dismissals to the
Massachusetts Appeals Court. In 2012theAppeals Courtissued
orders affirming the dismissals of each of the pending civil actions
filed by Mr. Tang against Framingham. Although Mr. Tang filed

Stamps v. Town of
Framingham, et al. 
Civil Rights 
a "Notice of Appeal to the next level of Appeals Court" in one of
the cases, the Appeals Court struck this filing from the docket as
improperly filed. Mr. Tang has not, to the knowledge of the
Town's lawyers in this case, Pierce, Davis & Perritano, LLP, filed
anyfurther motion orappeal inany ofthese cases. Accordingly,
these matters are now closed.
This case arises from the accidental shooting of Eurie Stamps on
January 5, 2011 in connection with a Framingham Police
Department SWAT Team raid, resulting in Mr. Stamps' death.
The Middlesex District Attorney conducted an investigation and
determined that criminal charges would not issue against the
officer who fired the weapon. On October 12, 2012, Mr. Stamps'
estate filed an action against the Town and others in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking claims for
alleged civil rights violations and wrongful death. MIIA has
retained the firm of Brody, Hardoon, Perkins and Kesten to
representthe Town inthis matter. After the parties filed initial
discovery disclosures under Local Rules of the Federal Court, the
Court held a scheduling conference on January 24, 2013.
Following this conference the Court issued orders limiting the
number of depositions to be taken, establishing deadlines for the
parties' amendment of pleadings and conduct of discovery
discovery must be completed by September 30, 2013),and
scheduling further case status conferences.

February 13, 2004 Decision issued by the Department of
Telecommunications and Energy, and pursuant to the January 1, 2007
IMAbetweenAshlandandFramingham. Thisrepresents morethana
100 -fold increase over what Framingham received from 1964 -2003
under the 1963 Intermunicipal Agreement with Ashland ($5500 per
year).Through 2012 the Town has received nearly $7 million dollars
in payments from Ashland ($6,994.883,75) under the successful 2004
Decision and the 2007 IMA that resulted.
By virtue of a prior year's favorable summary judgment ruling
achieved in the Pelham litigation, the Town was able to cease trash
collection at the 550 units at the Pelham Apartments, which results in
avoided expenses estimated at more than $100,000 per year. By
virtue of the Pelham ruling, the Town also was able to cease trash
collection at approximately 1,000 units owned by the Framingham
Housing Authority, thus realizing savings of approximately an
additional estimated $200,000 per year. These savings amount to
approximately $300,000 per year on an annual recurring basis without
adjusting for inflation.
As a result of the United States Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit's March 17, 2010 decision affirming the District Court's
decision allowing the Town's Motion for Summary Judgment with
respect to the Town's establishment of a 24 -day work period under
29 U.C. S.207(k),the Town has avoided liability to date for
approximately $1,000500,in damages, in view of the federal law that
often allows for double damages and attorney's fees to be assessed
against parties found to have violated the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Additionally, the Town has to date avoided the need to pay FLSA
overtime to officers who work more than 40 hours per week (CBA
overtime is paid),thus saving the Town approximately $150,000 per
year on an annual basis.

While we certainly cannot promise that the revenue, mitigation and avoided expenses
achieved in FY 2012 by the Office of Town Counsel will continue at the same level in the
future, we will continue to exercise creativity, diligence, and our best legal skill to address the
litigation that  does  arise  as  we  advocate on
behalf of the best interests of the Board of Selectmen and the taxpayers of the Town of

report writing in the field, messaging,
and access to state and federal law
enforcement data. Cost savings were
also realized with the replacement of
the previous mobile data terminal
solution.

The Facilities Management Department,
formerly known as Building Services, is
primarily responsible for overseeing and
performing maintenance operations at
General Government 
multiple public facilities owned by the
Town ofFramingham. The department's
main office is located in the Memorial
Building and is comprised of more than
35
Page 60
Town of Framingham
eight full -time employees, with an
operating budget of 1.6 million. Over the
past fiscal year, our department has
reevaluated its mission and goals to
identify target objectives aimed to better
serve the Town.
Nevins Hall has been the focus of much
attention. Working in collaboration with
the Capital Projects Manager and Parks
and Recreation, we have revitalized this
historic venue for all patrons to enjoy.
The main wood floors inside the Hall
have been sanded and refinished to
present a beautiful appearance, with plans
in the works to complete the balcony as
soon as possible. Most of the Hall has a
fresh coat of paint and a brand new sound
system is scheduled to be installed in
February2013. We hope to investmore
resources into this beautiful piece of
history to make it a  desirable venue
location for many years to come.
We have also incorporated today's
modern technology into our maintenance
operations by installing a computer -based
work order system, thanks to the
Technology Services Department. Using
this software, we are more equipped to
track maintenance issues and dispatch the
appropriate personnel to complete
tasking, as well as monitor recurring 
2012 Annual Town Report
maintenance trends to identify long -term
solutions.
Security measures have also been
improved at the Memorial Building by
installing a new card access system. The
funds for this upgrade were approved at
the Annual Town Meeting in 2012. This
system requires town employees to utilize
photo identification badges to enter the
facility outside normal business hours.
The funds appropriated for this project
will also be utilized to install the same
system at the Callahan Senior Center and
the Lexington Street Library. The card
access system is  a  computer based
program, which allows the Facilities
Department to monitor who and when
personnel are accessing the Town' s
buildings.
In conclusion, we have made great efforts
to improve the facilities that we are
responsible for by closely managing our
resources to ensure public's funds are
expended responsibly and in accordance
with the policies and procedures set forth
by the Town of Framingham Board of
Selectmen.

December 1, 2012, marked my fourth year
of service as the Capital Building Projects
Manager for the Town of Framingham.
During the past year, I have been able to
better understand the requirements of
many of the Town Owned properties, and
determine the financial, technical, and
political challenges that exist, working in
such a large and diverse community as
Framingham. 
As the Capital Building Projects Manager,
my activities last year, include working
alongside the Town Managers to help
envision, and expedite strategic building
projects. Theprojects thisyearInclude:
Memorial Building Widows, vault, and
Accounting Office Space and Lower Level
Floor Renovation, Maynard Building
drainage work, Fire Department
General Government  36
Page 61
Town of Framingham  2012 Annual Town Report
Headquarters work, Police Department
Headquarters, Fire Stations and the Main
Library work. On these projects, I  have
acted as Project Manager, OPM, Architect
andClerkoftheWorks. Thishassaved
the Town considerable time and money,
since only one salary has to be paid,
instead offour. The Challenge is to do
more with less: to manage time required
to Research, Design, Bid, Execute and
Monitor projects, simultaneously.
The position of Capital Building Projects
Manager, has also allowed me to be an
Energy advocate on behalf of the
Selectmen ofFramingham. The desire is
to decrease the energy Consumption of
town owned buildings. This will serve
three purposes:
1. Saving Framingham residents money.
2. Reducing the "carbon footprint" of
Framingham.
3. Repairing or replacing the existing,
outdated equipment, as required, before
failure occurs.
These goals align with my interests. I will
continue to seek rebate funding from
utilities wherever possible, to reduce
taxpayer burden.
As the Capital Building Projects Manager,
I  have worked with the Framingham 
Disability Commission. Ihave met
regularly with The Disabled Community
and the Historic Preservationists to learn
listen and understand their views and
positions. Foremost, the desire of the
Disabled Community to access all public
Buildings, including historic ones, with a
sense of dignity.
I have overseen design and construction
of a ramp at the Memorial Building, at the
Union Avenue Entrance, and a Sloped
walkway at the Village Hall Exterior.
We are currently working to make the
Main Library entrances ADA compliant.
Currently, they are not in compliance.
Town meeting help /  approval, we can
accomplish one ( 1) Entrance renovation
project- The Lexington Street side, this
year. Next year, the Pearl Street Entrance
will be our focus.
I  have also assisted the Library Building
Committee in the Designer Selection, for
the proposed McAuliffe Branch Library. I
am hopeful that that project will bring
renewed enthusiasm to the Nobscot
section of Town.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER I  TOWS
BOARD OF ASSESSORS 
ASURER/ TAX COLLECTOR
REMENT SYSTEM
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer
has bothfinancialandpolicyduties. Itis
staffed by the Chief Financial Officer,
Assistant Chief Financial Officer and the
Financial Analyst. The Office administers
Town finances with the assistance of three
departments that have direct responsibility
for financial management of Town
government: the Assessing Department is
responsible for the valuation of real and
personal property and the assessment of
taxes against these parcels and accounts.
The Office of the Treasurer/ Collector is
responsible for the collection of all town
revenues, the investment of all revenues,
and the management of the Town's debt.
The Accounting Department maintains
the Town's accounting records, generates
financial management information,
processes Town -wide employee payroll,
directs all audit activity and reviews
compliance with internal controls.
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer
is directly responsible for the development
of the annual operating and capital
budgets, monitors revenue and spending
throughout the year. The CFO is also
required to file a long term forecast for
strategic planning of the Towns financial
position.
Calendar year 2012 was a year of financial
accomplishment. At the fall Town
Meeting of 2012, Town Meeting Members
appropriated monies to complete the full
funding oftheStabilization Fund. Level
Service budgets were approved for most
core services. The School Department
not only received a level service budget,
Finance 
but $1.4 million was added for rebuilding.
The FY13 budget, passed in 2012, raised
the tax levy 1.5 %, the first time that was
ever approved in the Town. While
expenditure growth still exceeds revenue
growth, the trend is slowing due both to
increasing state aid and cost containment
efforts. TheTown muststilllivewithin
its means. Health insurance and unfunded
liabilities still over burden the budget, but
recent health insurance agreements have
reduced both costs. The health insurance
appropriation for FY13 was actually less
than FY12. The OPEB valuation for 2012
is now almost $16 million less than 2010.
The CFO's Office is  committed to
responsible financial management which
is critical to the forward progress of the
Town.
This Division has absorbed more
management responsibility without
additional resources, yet still provides the
clarity and transparency of information to
Town residents and excelling in their
fiduciary duties. The Finance Division has
produced more data to more residents and
officials than ever before and posted more
information to the Town website than has
ever been posted before.
The CFO would like to thank the
Assistant CFO, Jennifer Pratt, Richard G.
Howarth, Jr. and his staff in the
Accounting Department, Dan Dargon
and his staff in the Assessing Office and
Stephen Price and his staff in the Office
of the Treasurer/ Collector. The
dedication to their jobs, the quality of
their work and their consideration of their
39

Town of Framingham  2012 Annual Town Report
Stephen W. Price, Treasurer Collector
Cindi Natoli, Fiscal Supervisor
Carolyn R. Lyons, Assist. Treasurer Collector
Rajni Sharma, Payroll Fiscal Supervisor
Ross Netherton, Office Coordinator
Dawn Devito, Office Manager
Robin Nemeth, Admin. Assistant II
Sara Beth Harding, Customer Service Representative
Fiscal Year 2012 was a good year in this
busy office of  8.  The
Treasurer/ Collector's Office continues to
provide customer service and essential
municipal services. As always, I  am
indebted to my staff for the firs -class job
they do on my behalf as well as the Town
of Framingham.
Our operating system on Munis continues
to be updated on a  regular basis
Collection amounts and percentages were
as follows. Real Estate taxes collected
were $  151,865.207,68 (98.01 %),  and
Personal Property taxes were
9,976.324,96 (98.69 %).  Excise Taxes
collected were $  5,593.857,46 (87.90 %).
Excise tax is collected on a calendar -year
basis, which is reflected in the lower
collection percentage. Tax Title
collections were $ 926,09; 614. we have
continued to work hard on delinquent
taxes in every area and recently foreclosed
on two unoccupied properties and will
schedule an auction soon. We have
implemented the use of credit /debit card
swipe machines and promoted our web
based online biller and payment services
in the Tax Collectors Office, to improve
customer service.
Finance 
Earnings on general fund investments for
the year totaling $ 119,96441. were slightly
above budget.
We continue to monitor the bank rates to
maximize our earnings. The Town's Bond
Rating is currently at Aa2 with a stabilized
outlook in FY 2013 from Moody's. The
future will hold a challenge to maintain it,
but the goal is to work to that end. We
issued one multi- purpose 
bond
anticipation note in 2012 ,  awarded to
Eastern Bank, in the amount of
47,202 , 578, including a  premium of
79,89723.and net interest cost of 0.1630
and a coupon rate of 0.50 %.
Additionally, the Town issued an interim
loan totaling $ 3,896142, through the
Massachusetts Water Pollution Abatement
Trust at a rate of 0.13 %.  The town also
permanently financed through the
Massachusetts Water Pollution Abatement
Trust multiple sewer projects in the
amount of $30,526.359,05 at a rate of 2.00
for various sewer improvement
projects. The Town secured an interest
free loan through the Mass Water
Resource Authority for $424,75.932.
This department has worked diligently to
meet the requirements of the laws, the
Challenges of the technology advances,

Town of Framingham
and the Town's customer service policy.
We treat taxpayers with respect while
accepting their payments, answering their
Questions regarding process, and solving
their problems as quickly and efficiently as
Possible. As per Town By -Law, I  am
reporting the following information
regarding authorized debt schedules. The
first schedule shows what is authorized
and un- issued as of June 30, 2012. The
second schedule shows the debt issued
and outstanding during Fiscal Year 2012.

Town of Framingham  2012 Annual Town Report
Board of Assessors
Memorial Building, Rm 1011508-5415532-1  assessing @framinghamma. gov
The Board ofAssessors' annual report for
calendar year 2011 with statistics from
Fiscal Year 2012 is as follows:
Because of the values established in Fiscal
Year 2012, we received 1,314 abatement
applications. These applications
represented 6.39% of the total tax bills
issued for Fiscal Year 2012.
In Fiscal Year 2013 the residential class
contributed $11.4 million dollars in new
value. This growth was attributed to
improvements made to the residential
inventory during 2012 including new
construction, remodeling and additions
completed during the year.
Commercial, Industrial and Personal
Property growth added $11.4 million
dollars of new taxable improvements to
the Commercial /Industrial /Personal
Property tax base.
I would like to thank the Board of
Assessors members Mrs. Kathryn Pierce,
MAA & Mr. Arthur Holmes, MAA for
their work throughout the Fiscal Year.
Additionally I would like to thank the
Assessing Department staff for all their
hard work throughout the year. Also, I
would like to thank Mr. James Sullivan,
Esquire for his legal assistance.
After making a presentation to the Board
of Selectmen on December 19, 2012 for
the Fiscal year 2012 Tax Rate
Classification Hearing, the Board voted to
adopt a 75% shift in values of the
Commercial, Industrial and Personal
Property classes of property to maintain
the share of the tax levy borne by these 
classes in Fiscal Year 2012. The Fiscal
Year tax rates are: Residential - $16.94 and
Commercial, Industrial and Personal
Property - $38.05.
PROPERTY AND TAXES ASSESSED

A MESSAGE FROM CHIEF
CARL
As we move into 2013, it continues to be
my honor and privilege to serve as the
Chief of Police for the Town of
Framingham and I respectfully submit this
annual report to the community, on
behalf of the men and women of the
Framingham Police Department. I  am
extremely proud of the Department and
the excellent services our Police Officers
provide to those who live, work, and visit
Framingham. It is and has been my
philosophy that we must strive to serve
the community in the most efficient
manner possible. During my tenure as
Chief, I  have continually sought new
avenues to improve our effectiveness and
increase the Department's efficiency,
accountability and productivity. Given the
restrictive fiscal climate, these efforts are
now more challenging than ever before.
Although limited resources have required
a  reduction or elimination of certain
services, the Department's dedicated staff
is committed to deliver the very best
public safety services possible. We remain
proud to protect and serve the Town,
while recognizing the value of excellence
in public safety. This excellence has been
recognized by our peers in public safety
and the Department is proud to be leader
in our industry. We have achieved and
maintained State Accreditation and are
one of a small number of departments in 
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to
have earned this stamp of approval.
During the past year, the men and women
of this department have achieved
outstanding accomplishments in the areas
of community partnerships and crime
suppression. With the community's
continued support, we look forward to
continuing this success in the coming
year.

Emergency Management
Framingham Emergency Management
Agency ( FrEMA) directs all emergency
management operations in the Town of
Framingham. Emergency management is
the preparedness, mitigation, response and
recovery 
of both naturally occurring
events like blizzards, ice storms,
hurricanes, flooding or earthquakes as well
as any man -made disasters such as
chemical spills, fires, transportation events
Public Safety & Health 
2012 Annual Town Report
and acts of terrorism. Framingham
Emergency Management has worked
extensively under its current structure to
create planning groups, exercise response
activities, secure funding from grants and
state and federal sources and expand
participation in this municipal function.
FrEMA in concert with Framingham
department of public works and the
Northeast Homeland Security Regional
Advisory Council also operate an
emergency equipment cache located at
Framingham DPW. This cache is one of
only three in the State and will be used to
disperse equipment and supplies during
emergencies. FrEMA in conjunction with
state and federal authorities, prepares,
administers and  implements
Framingham's CEMP (  Comprehensive
Emergency Management Plan) as well as
the federal mandated NIMSCAST. In
2007 the entire CEMP was rewritten and
printed; this is the first time since 1997.
In 2010 Framingham also joined five
other communities (  Ashland, Natick,
Holliston, Hopkinton and Sherborn) to
form the MetroWest Regional Emergency
Planning Committee. This planning
committee is currently working on a table
top exercise for the fall of 2013.
In 2012 FrEMA took delivery of a brand
new mobile command post, this vehicle is
outfitted with the latest technology for
crimes scenes, 
natural disasters and
planned events. The vehicle has a
conference room, 3 dispatch areas, hard
wired telephones, weather station, 40 foot
boom with camera and specialized scene
lighting. The vehicle is operated by a nine
member emergency management strike
team.
Framingham will continue to be a leader
in the ever increasing role of emergency
management in a post 911 era, roles and
104
Page 129
Town of Framingham
responsibilities are increasing and the
Town will need to recognize the value of
emergency preparedness.
The Director of FrEMA is Deputy Police
Chief Steve Trask with 3 Asst. Emergency
Mgt. Directors; Asst. Fire Chief John
Magri, Police Lt. Blaise Tersoni and Police
Lt. Mike Siaba.
Jail Diversion Program
During 2012 the Jail Diversion Program
evaluated 764 individuals with mental
illness that the police department had
come into contact with. Of those 764
evaluations 66 had committed arrestable
offenses but were diverted away from
arrest and into mental health treatment
programs. Forty -nine of the evaluations
would normally have been evaluated at the
Emergency Room at MetroWest Medical
Center but instead were diverted away and
handled by the program's clinician.
Twelve of the individuals were in fact
arrested for their offences but due to their
mental health condition received court
ordered treatment instead of punitive
sanctions.

The Framingham Animal Control
Department is staffed by 2 full -time and 1
part- time Animal Control Officers. The
Officers provide service to the residents
of Framingham and care for the animals
held by the department 365 days a year.
The Animal Control Officers enforce
both town bylaws and Massachusetts
General Laws. The MGL Chapter 140
laws were updated and came into effect
November 1, 2012. The Animal Control
Public Safety & Health 
2012 Annual Town Report
Officers attended training regarding these
changes. Framingham Animal Control
Officers work cooperatively with many
outside agencies such as 
the
Massachusetts Department of Agriculture,
Massachusetts Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, Boston Animal
Rescue League and the Animal Control
Officers Association of Massachusetts.
Animal Control Officers work in
conjunction with other town of
Framingham departments such as the
Board of Health, Police Department and
Fire Department. Police assists are usually
the result of an arrest, search warrant or
domestic situation in which animals must
be either controlled or removed. In
addition to regular shifts, the Animal
Control Officers also respond to off -hour
emergencies as needed.
The Animal Control Officers respond to
calls regarding domestic animals, livestock
and wildlife. There are more than 40
different locations that keep livestock and
fowl within the town of Framingham. The
annual livestock census, required by the
Massachusetts Department of Agriculture,
Division of Animal Health, is taken by the
members of this department. All members
of the department are certified Animal
Control Officers and sworn
Massachusetts Animal Inspectors. As
Animal Inspectors, Officers are required
to issue quarantines for bites and wounds
of unknown origin. Animal Control
Officers responded to more than 5,795
calls in 2012. Approximately 647 wildlife
calls were fielded by the department.
Approximately 1,136 canine calls were
fielded by the department. Approximately
351 feline calls were fielded by the
department. Other calls such as animal
quarantines, police assists and compliance
checks etc. totaling approximately 3,661
were addressed by Animal Control
Officers. Rabies continues to be a health
concern in our community. Dogs, cats
105
Page 130
Town of Framingham
and ferrets are required to be vaccinated
against Rabies. This offers protection not
only to the pet but also to the public. In
December of 2012 a rabid cat attacked
and injured two individuals. Fortunately
the individuals' involved sought medical
treatment as the disease, left untreated, is
fatal. This incident serves as a reminder to
all pet owners, 
the importance of
vaccinating their pets. Unvaccinated cats
are the primary vector for the spread of
Rabies between wildlife and humans.
Animal Control Officers continue their
training concentrating on Emergency
Sheltering, Disaster Preparedness and
Management by attending the National
Animal Control Officers Disaster training.
The officers offer educational materials
and information to the public regarding
animal safety, disease prevention, and
disaster preparedness. This material
obtained through the Massachusetts
Division of Fisheries and Wildlife,
Massachusetts Department of Public
Health, MEMA, and the Massachusetts
Department of Agriculture Division of
Animal Health.

SWAT During 2012 the Framingham
SWAT Team conducted four high risk
tactical missions. These operations were in
support of the narcotics unit during the
execution of search warrants. All tactical
missions involved suspects that were
armed with weapons and/ or had histories
of violent armed criminal acts. The SWAT
team also intervened with a  suicidal
suspect who had a large cache of firearms.
The incident was quickly and safely
resolved and resulted in crisis mental
health treatment for the subject. The
SWAT team consists of the Tactical Unit,
Tactical Emergency Medics (TEMS) and
Public Safety & Health 
2012 Annual Town Report
the Crisis Negotiation Unit. Each tactical
team member trained a minimum of 280
hours on topics including firearms
proficiency, less lethal weapons, TASER,
building search techniques, arrest tactics,
trauma medical care, and use of force
applications. The Negotiators and Medics
also conducted training throughout the
year to hone their skills. Negotiators train
an average of 96 hours annually per
member in crisis communication skills
and the Medics train approximately 96
hours annually in emergency rescue and
medical trauma techniques.
Auxiliary Police The 21 dedicated
men and women of the Framingham
Auxiliary Police completed another
outstanding year of service for the
community. For the past 70 years, the
Auxiliary Police have been an active and
vital component of  the Police
Department. The Auxiliary Police, under
the guidance of Auxiliary Captain Marc
Spigel, have a 
well -defined training
program 
in which officers attend an
academy for reserve police officers; and
are trained in first responder first aid and
CPR /AED. Annually the Auxiliary
Officers keep their skills and certification
current with field and in- service training.
The result is a  professional Auxiliary
Police Organization that stands ready to
assist this department. Duringtheyear,
the Auxiliary Officers volunteer countless
hours of their time to help make
Framingham a better place to live and
work. You can see some of their
volunteer efforts in action at community
events such as Concerts on the Green,
charitable road races, and child safety
programs. As part of the Framingham
Emergency Management Agency,
Auxiliary Police Officers provide
assistance at the Emergency Operations
Center and emergency shelters as needed,
106

and are trained in the National Incident
Management System.

Services and the Town and Department
provide assistance and support to the

they are deployed for active combat duty;
many thanks to those who have served on
our behalf.
The operation of the Fire Department is
large and complex. We do more than
simply respond to fires, rescues and
medical emergencies. Because some of
the incidents we encounter are larger or
more technical than the resources readily
available to the fire department, we work
collaboratively with various departments
and agencies both in and outside the
town. Some of these collaborations
include:

FIRE PREVENTION DIVISION:
The Division of Fire Prevention is
comprised of one Fire Marshal, Assistant
Fire Marshal and one Inspector who are
responsible for enforcing fire codes,
issuing permits, conducting inspections,
testing fire protection systems, reviewing
plans, investigating fire causes 
and
conducting fire safety presentations. The
Fire Prevention division regularly attends
standardized training with the
Massachusetts Department of Fire
Services to ensure a consistent approach
in conducting business.
Public Safety & Health  109

The Fire Marshal is responsible for the
day -to -day operation of the fire
prevention office. He is also responsible
for conducting fire investigations and
coordinating activities between the
Framingham Police Department and the
State Fire Marshal' s office. Other
responsibilities of the Marshal include
giving safety talks for Framingham's
schools, citizens groups, group residences,

TRAINING:
The primary objective of training is to
facilitate safe and effective operations.
National statistics continually cite
emergency vehicle operations as 
the
greatest are of liability. Magna Fire Service
Resources, LLC was brought in to deliver
an emergency vehicle operator course to
the Department. The course consisted of
a  classroom component in which all
general laws and best practices were
highlighted, and a practical component in
which all members had to manipulate
their assigned apparatus through an
obstacle course of highway cones. This
standardized emergency 
vehicle
operations class is  parallels the
commercial driver's license course. This
training helped to identify needs and
establish some goals and objectives for the
upcoming year's training; specifically the
daily vehicle check, operator's brake
system check and new driver training. All
three training needs are in development
and will be implemented in the spring of
2011. The Framingham Fire Department
Training will remain proactive in regards
to safe emergency vehicle operations.
The majority of training hours are devoted
to basic firefighting and medical rescue
skill maintenance. Most of this training is
conducted by the officers as company
leveldrills. Of the basic skills, the self -
contained breathing apparatus (  SCBA)
poses the most liability and remains a top
trainingpriority. SCBA trainingis broken
down into two sections —  basic
procedures and emergency procedures.
On a regular basis all members must
demonstrate proficiency in both areas.
Other company level drills follow
standardized tactics and procedures and
cover a diverse range of skills such as
ground ladders, hand tools, extrication,
meteringdevices and medical care. With
the exception of Sundays and holidays, 
2012 Annual Town Report
trainingis conducted on every shift. All
training is documented electronically and
quality controlled by the training officer.
Each Framingham Firefighter logs
hundreds of hours of training annually.
Technical rescue disciplines are also an
integral part of the Department Trench
rescue, collapse rescue, confined space
rescue, hazardous materials response and
dive team operations are all specialized
areas that the Department is fortunate
enough to have several members actively
participating with established teams.
Members of the Department that are not
being trained to the operational level must
be trained to a support level to be able to
operate in any technical rescue.
In addition to having our own highly
skilled Dive Team the Framingham Fire
Department works cooperatively with the
State Hazardous Material Response Team
and the Fire District 14 Technical Rescue
Team

East Middlesex Mosquito Control
Project
The East Middlesex Mosquito Control
Project conducts a  program in
Framingham consisting of mosquito
surveillance, larval and adult mosquito
control, ditch maintenance and public
education.
Extraordinarily warm and dry conditions
during the 2012 winter and spring resulted
in low numbers of spring floodwater
mosquitoes but contributed to a buildup
of West Nile virus and EEE disease risk.
In Massachusetts during 2012, there were
33 human cases of West Nile Virus and 7
human cases of EEE including 1  EEE
case in the MetroWest area.
The adult mosquito surveillance program
used traps to collect mosquitoes from 5
Framingham locations. Data was
compiled from 28 mosquito trap
collections. During the summer, 23
Public Safety & Health 
2012 Annual Town Report
mosquito samples from Framingham were
tested for West Nile Virus and EEE by
the Mass. Dept. of Public Health. A
sample is  comprised of up to 50
mosquitoes of the same species from a
mosquito trap. In late July, mosquitoes
from 1  Framingham trap collection tested
positive for West Nile Virus.
The larval mosquito control program
relied on the larvicides Baa'llus thuraugieusis
var. israeleusis ( Bti) Baa'llus sphaericus and
methoprene, which are classified by the
EPA as relatively non -toxic. Field crews
using portable sprayers applied Bti in the
spring and the summer to 24 wetland
acres when high densities of mosquito
larvae were found instagnant water. Due
to abnormally dry conditions, the annual
spring helicopter application of Bti to
control spring floodwater mosquitoes was
cancelled. In June Project personnel
applied time release packets containing
methoprene to control Culex mosquito
larvae at 5,447 roadside catch basins.
Larvicides were applied to control Culex
mosquitoes at 2  neglected swimming
pools.
For adult mosquito control, 6 crews were
assigned to apply Sumithrin to 3,291 acres
at night using truck mounted aerosol
sprayers, when survey traps indicated high
mosquito populations. Advance notice of
the spray program was done through
notices in the MetroWest Daily News and
on the Town website.
At Bishop Terrace, an excavator was used
to maintain 758 linear feet of a waterway
and hand tools were used to remove
debris from another 152 feet. AtRaleigh
Rd. the excavator maintained 329 linear
feet of a ditch and hand tools were used
to remove debris and maintain another

Hand tools were used to remove debris in
order to maintain 854 feet of a waterway
at Little Tree Lane and 893 feet of a
waterway by Knight Rd.
The Project's public education program is
designed to develop awareness within the
public and the private sectors as to their
rolesin mosquito control. The Project
serves as a  resource to residents,
municipal officials and the local media on
mosquitoes and mosquito borne diseases.

The Nuisance Officer has investigated and
pursued over 375 cases involving Trash &
Debris, Commercial Vehicles,
Unregistered Vehicles and Vehicles.
Code Enforcement inspectors responded

complaints and monitored 169 foreclosed
properties.
Sign permitting was similar to last years'
activities. Sign enforcement activities are
at record levels due to the Sign Officer

town wide sign compliance date of
December 1, 2012 has passed and there
has been much success with compliance,
with much more to accomplish.

ENGINEERING AND
TRANSPORTATION DIVISION
The Engineering and Transportation Division
is responsible for the planning, design and
construction of capital roadway and utility
infrastructure projects, maintaining
compliance with various State &  Federal
programs such as 
NPDES Phase II
stormwater, managing the Town's Street
Opening Permit and Trench Opening Permit
programs, reviewing development and
redevelopment plans to ensure roadway and
utility changes conform to the Town's
construction standards, and inspecting
modifications and expansions to the roadway,
water, sewer and stormwater networks. The
Division also provides technical expertise to
the operational divisions of the Public Works
Department, other Town Departments,
various Boards, Committees, and
Commissions, maintains an extensive
Geographical Information System (GIS) and
is the custodian of a  large collection of
irreplaceable paper plans and documents.
The Division continued to devote significant
resources toward the Department's extensive
capital improvement program which includes
projects mandated under MADEP
Administrative Consent Order (ACO). 
During 2012, 35 capital improvement projects
were advanced or completed. Over 41,000
linear feet ( almost eight miles) of water and
wastewater mains were replaced or
rehabilitated. Locations included A Street,
Arsenal Road, Arthur Street, Auburn Street,
Bridges Street, Catherine Road, Central Street,
Chouteau Avenue, Clark Street, Clifford
Street, Clinton Street, Coburn Street, Colonial
Drive, Concord Street, Cypress Street, Eaton
Road, Edgell Road, Eisenhower Road, Event
Street, Florissant Avenue, Grant Street,
Hemenway Road, Hollis Street, Irving Street,
Kings Row Lane, Laclede Avenue, Lasalle
Avenue, Lake Road, Lakeview Road,
Lawrence Street, Mansfield Street, Mellon
Street, Nob Hill Drive, Park Street, Pond
Street, Royal Meadow Lane, Speen Street,
Vaillencourt Drive, Valentine Road, Waverly
Street and Winthrop Street.
Construction continued on the new A Street
Wastewater Management Facility. This facility
is now substantially complete and operational.
Rehabilitations of the Pleasant Street and
Grove Street Water Pump Stations were also
completed in2012. Five wastewater pump
stations were permanently removed from
service and replaced with gravity sewer
systems. These included the former stations
on Arsenal Road, Lakeview Road, Speen
Public Works  122

Drive and Valentine
The Prospect Street roadway restoration
project included the reconstruction and
resurfacing of 5,200 linear feet of roadway
and 4,300 linear feet of sidewalk. An
additional 11,000 linear feet of roadway was
resurfaced and 6,400 linear feet of sidewalk
was reconstructed on Concord Street,
Gorman Road, Gorman Road Extension and
Grant Street as part of the East Framingham
Sewer Improvements project.
The Division also coordinated with the
MassDOT to advance several projects, the
most significant being the Reconstruction of
Route 126 ( Concord Street) project in the
downtown area. This project is  being
designed by the Town and will include
roadway resurfacing, new sidewalks and
crosswalks, traffic signals, street lighting,
street trees, and landscaped areas. The design
advanced to the 75 percent stage in 2012 and
construction is scheduled to begin in 2014.
The construction of this eleven million dollar
project will be fully funded from federal and
state sources. The Division also worked with
MassDOT on four bridge projects ( Winter
Street over the Sudbury River, Winter Street
over the Railroad, Wickford Road and Central
Street in Saxonville). Construction will begin
on the Winter Street Bridge over the Sudbury
River and the Wickford Road Bridge in 2014.
In 2012, twenty design projects were
advanced or completed. These included the
downtown MassDOT transportation project,
sewer capacity improvements downstream of
the Technology Park, elimination of the
Worcester Road sewer pump station and
rehabilitation of the Beebe Water Tanks.
The Division continued its planning efforts in
anticipation of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's (EPA) release of an
updated NPDES Phase II Stormwater permit
in the spring of 2013. Based on prior drafts,
the new permit will increase requirements for
Public Works 
2012 Annual Town Report
compliance including additional outfall testing
and inspections, increased public education
and outreach, an expansion of the included
Town facilities, and may require
retrofits /reconstruction of  Town
infrastructure.
The Division worked with the Town's Traffic
and Roadway Safety Committee to develop a
Traffic Calming Policy that was approved by
the Board of Selectmen. A preliminary
design for traffic calming and safety
improvements was also prepared for
Edmands Road.
In addition to updating the GIS system to
capture the significant amount of construction
work completed by DPW, the Division also
assisted several other departments in 2012.
These included the Board of Health with
environmental impact maps for the General
Chemical site, the Town Clerk's office with
Precinct locator maps for the Town's website,
the Planning Board with rail trail development
maps, and the Middlesex District Attorney's
office in support of several school /park zone
drug cases. Preparations were also made to
obtain new town -wide aerial photography in
early 2013.
The Division reviewed 290 plan submittals
received either directly or routed to Public
Works from the Building Department,
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Appeals;
and processed 564 Street Opening Permits
and 404 Trench Opening Permits. One ofthe
more significant development projects the
Division was involved with was the Danforth
Green Planned Unit Development project in
Saxonville. Thiswasduetotheproject's size,
360 units);potential to impact the Town's
water, wastewater and transportation systems;
and proximity to the Birch Road well field.
HIGHWAY MANAGEMENT
PROGRAM
The Highway Division is responsible for the
maintenance and repair of the Town's
roadway and sidewalk infrastructure including;
123
Page 148
Town of Framingham
pavement markings, granite and bituminous
curbing, street and regulatory signage,
stormwater utilities, traffic islands, and public
shade trees.
Stormwater Management
The Stormwater Management System consists
of more than 200 miles of surface and
subsurface drainage systems, 12,200 catch
basin and manhole structures, and more than
600 drainage outfalls. 2012construction
projects completed by Town and contracted
personnel included the installation of 180
linear feet of new drain line, stormwater pipe
and catch basin installation and the repair of
drain lines on Mellen Street, Arsenal Road,
Beaver Park Road, Irving Street, Franklin
Street, and Hollis Street as well as the repair
of 533 drainage structures and cleaning of
58,838 linear feet of drainpipe. The Division
has instituted a monthly inspection practice in
a  proactive drainage structure maintenance
program.
The Division is responsible for maintaining,
inspecting and operating the Town's
Saxonville flood levee system which consists
of 2,550 feet of earth dikes, 1,340 feet of
concrete flood walls, 1,000 feet of channel
realignment, a  pumping station, interior
drainage and a vehicular flood gate.
In order to maintain compliance with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)
NPDES Phase II Stormwater Permit, the
Highway Division made a vigorous year -long
effort to clean all of the catch basins utilizing
both Town crews and contracted services, to
remove silt, sand, and debris from
approximately 8,500 catch basins last year.
Over 800 tons of catch basin debris was
removed from catch basins and hauled to an
accepting facility by Town equipment and
personnel. The storm drain cleaning program
has continued to produce a significant repair
list as the inspection process progresses. The
Beaver Dam Brook and Hop Brook continue
to be significant operational challenges for the
Division as even modest rain events may
Public Works 
2012 Annual Town Report
cause the brooks to surcharge at the many
culvert headwalls in both South Framingham
and the Gregory Road and McAdams areas of
North Framingham. For this reason the
Division has installed automated monitoring
sensors that alert staff to high water levels
The deficiencies in the stormwater systems
throughout the Town are a major cause of
unscheduled overtime and emergency repair
cost incurred by the Town.
In an effort to minimize the amount of sand
entering and further diminishing the capacity
of the system, the Division has continued
strict control practices for the use of de -icing
materials during the winter months. In
addition, an aggressive and comprehensive
post- winter street and sidewalk cleaning
program is performed annually to remove as
much sand as possible from the streets and
thereby minimize the opportunity for
accumulation in the drainage system.
The Division performs a comprehensive town
wide street cleaning routine as well as
overnight sweeping in the streets and
sidewalks of the commercial areas to
minimize the entry of materials into the
drainage system and to provide a cleaner
environment in the downtown area. The
removal of sand and debris from the Town's
catch basins and manholes remains an
operational priority each year.
Pavement Management
The 2012 construction projects included the
replacement or upgrade of roadway elements
and appurtenances so that both regulatory
guidelines and directives continued to be
adhered to and visual enhancements could be
made. New pavement markings, street signs,
sidewalks, granite and bituminous curbing,
wheelchair ramps 
and curb -cut control
measures were addressed during construction.
The 2012 road program addressed more than
21 lane miles of roadways in the Town. The
Division continued to integrate and manage
the use of specialized contracted equipment
124
Page 149
Town of Framingham
with in- house resources. The Division
repaired over three miles of deficient
roadways through a  milling and paving
method. The development of this program
has led to greater cost control, quality control,
and accountability while performing repair
work on defective roadways. The strategy and
design behind this program had drawn the
attention of other large communities in the
Commonwealth. In addition, the Division
responded to emergency repairs, preventive
maintenance, and filled over 9,500 potholes in
2012. The Division has currently replaced
2,550 linear feet of defective guardrails
through this ongoing state financed ( Chapter
90) road program.
Winter Storm Management
The Highway Division is responsible for the
provision of a safe automotive and pedestrian
environment both during and after winter
storm events. This effort involves the plowing
and treating of 550 lane miles of public
roadway, 36 municipal parking facilities, 87
miles of sidewalks and public pathways, 183
crosswalks, 187 cul -de -sacs and 31 school
crossing -guard stations and student drop -off
areas. Snow and ice operations are among the
most important of responsibilities charged to
the Department of Public Works. No activity
performed by a Town entity encompasses
more uncontrollable factors, nor has a greater
impact on the community than does that of
the proper handling of snow and ice events.
Those factors include weather, the amount of
snowfall, rate of snowfall, duration of the
storm, and type of precipitation. Not only do
these factors have to be considered, their
impact on resources and costs, including
manpower, equipment, and materials must be
understood and appropriately managed.
The Division has integrated the Town's
Geographical Information System (GIS) with
an Incident Command Structure to manage
each event. In addition the department
installed global positioning units (GPS) into
plowing equipment. The purpose of this
strategic effort is to provide a high level of
Public Works 
2012 Annual Town Report
accountability while applying the appropriate
amount of resources to each storm event. In
order to be fiscally responsible, the
Department has developed a strategy to focus
on main roads with greater speeds and higher
traffic volumes, while utilizing a measured
response on secondary roads, making them
safe and passable.
All Town spreader trucks are equipped with a
computerized distribution system that
operates according to ground speed, thus
ensuring the uniform distribution of de -icing
materials.
Tree Warden & Forestry Management
The Highway Division is responsible for the
maintenance management of the Town's
estimated 12,000 public shade trees and for
the development of a Public Shade Tree
program for the community. The purpose of
this program is to promote, preserve, and
enhance the shade tree environment of the
community through the application of best
management practices and public education
campaigns. The Town of Framingham was
named a Tree City USA again in 2012.
The Highway Division oversees the Town's
vegetation management program that is
permitted annually by the Massachusetts
Department of Agricultural Resources
Pesticide Bureau. This program allows the
Department to apply best management
practices for the control of curbside
vegetation that otherwise would grow
uncontrollably and require the commitment of
substantial and sustained labor to control
unwanted growth.
A primary and recurring function of this
operating group is the statutory requirement
to maintain minimum clearance over the 550
lane mile roadway network. In 2012, 78 miles
of pruning were completed to provide
clearance andsafetravel lanes. TheTown's
shade trees, while providing a great public
amenity to the Town, require routine
maintenance so that they do not also become
125
Page 150
Town of Framingham
a public liability. The tree crew performs
monthly surveys to determine hazardous trees
and diseases and takes corrective action to
minimize damage and response during severe
weather events. The Division is responsible
for the cleanup and removal of storm debris.
In response to Hurricane Sandy, which
occurred on October 29 the Division
conducted an unrestricted curbside brush
collection for residents.
The Tree Warden conducts frequent
hazardous tree assessments, prescribes
treatment, oversees removals, and participates
in public hearings on issues related to trees
within the right of way. The Department
routinely responds to residents' inquiries and
requests forservice. During 2012 Forestry
Management personnel removed 143 dead,
diseased, and /or hazardous street trees and
responded to 64 emergency removals as a
result of tree failure impacting roads or other
public properties.
Traffic Systems Management
The Traffic Systems section of the Highway
Division manages the maintenance,
fabrication, and placement of the Town's
regulatory and street signage, steel -beam
safety guardrail, installation of new and annual
maintenance of existing pavement markings,
and the work zone safety program 
for
Division operations. This section is
responsible for advance planning of traffic
management coordination
construction, as 
well 
for roadway
as 
for the
implementation of street -by- street "  no
parking" postings required to efficiently
advance the street sweeping program. The
pre -planning for traffic management during
the construction season maximizes the
efficient production of the work, and also
contributes to a  safe environment for the
motorists and the work crews alike.
The Traffic Systems section managed the
annual contract and divisional painting of 81
miles of yellow centerline, 93 miles of white
edge line, over 700 crosswalks, 771 stop bars,
and 362 arrows throughout the Town.
Public Works 
2012 Annual Town Report
In addition, the Division responded to Police,
Fire and other safety road related issues
requiring emergency 
traffic management,
installed and or replaced hundreds of
regulatory and advisory signs either by
direction of the Board of Selectmen, the
Traffic Roadway Safety Committee, or as
required through routine maintenance
practices.
SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
PROGRAM
The Solid Waste Management Program is
responsible for the management and oversight
of the Town's Solid Waste and Recycling
Programs. Materials are collected by means of
curbside and containerized collection
programs, the leaf and yard waste drop -off
area and the operation of a  Resource
Recovery Center located on Mt. Wayte Ave.
The Division manages the collection of refuse
and recycling from 19,508 dwelling units
weekly, averaging more than 3,900 curbside
collection stops and 90,000 pounds per day
collected curbside.
During 2012 the Town experienced a major
weather event; Hurricane Sandy. Among
other things, this storm resulted in major tree
damage throughout the community.
Managing this material created a huge burden
on homeowner's. As a result, in conjunction
with the Highway Division, a special town
wide unrestricted curbside brush and tree limb
collection was performed. This allowed
residents to remove all of the tree waste storm
debris from their yards.
July 1, 2012 marked the transition of new
vendors contracted to collect solid waste and
recycling from town owned buildings and
condominiums resulting in the simultaneous
exchange of 181 solid waste and recycling
containers throughout town. This was
successfully accomplished with minimal
disruption. 
126
Page 151
Town of Framingham
Since the initial cart distribution many home
owners have requested to enlarge the capacity
oftheir cart. In2012 the division has satisfied
210 service requests from residents to
exchange their cart to the larger size. The cart
radio frequency identification system (RFID)
allows the town to track what home carts are
assigned to, how often and what time of day
they are serviced. This continues to be a
valuable tool for the town to maintain
contractor accountability ensuring the proper
delivery of service has been performed.
The division has continued to employ a
multifaceted approach to decrease the Town's
overall trash disposal costs. Some of these
approaches included:
1  The attainment of waste reduction
grants from the Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection
MassDEP).
2.  Phase Two of a  pilot program
implementing reusable trays and
silverware in the cafeterias of McCarthy
Elementary ( January 2012), Woodrow
Wilson Elementary ( February 2012),and
Brophy Elementary School ( December
2012) thereby eliminating the need to
dispose of polystyrene trays.
91  The Division continues to sell
natural mulch and compost to the
homeowners and landscapers at a reduced
rate. This helped to reduce disposal cost,
raise additional revenues for the town and
created a full circle recycling loop. In
addition, these materials have helped
other town departments reduce costs.
The division has provided these materials
for various town projects such as at our
Resource Recovery Center itself, as a soil
amendment in athletics fields, landscaping
at Town owned buildings and other
various projects around town. These
materials are provided at no cost to other
town departments allowing them
significant financial savings.
11  Public Education; 2012 continued
our themed monthly events and
Public Works 
2012 Annual Town Report
programs. These events and services are
offered to residents at no additional cost
and included Household Hazardous
Waste Day, the Earth Day Celebration
and the Town Wide Green -Up Day. Our
most popular events continue to be the
Shred Fest (secure confidential document
shredding) and our Free Electronics Day.
Both events are held at no additional
charge to the residents. Furthermore, the
electronics take back day has allowed the
town to donate hundreds of pounds of
non -perishable food to local food pantries
as participating residents are encouraged
tomakeadonation. This hasalsohelped
the Town to properly recycle and dispose
of thousands of pounds of discarded
electronics.
5.  Division employees have
conducted multiple tours of the facility
promoting the recycling program.
The Resource Recovery Center (RRC) located
on Mount Wayte Ave has continued the
tradition of providing quality service to
residents. In 2012 the division had robust
sticker sales issuing 6,735 permits to residents
providing access to the solid waste and
recycling services offered at the facility. The
center continues to provide excellent
customer service at reduced costs to the
residents. The Town continues to partner
with the Town of Wellesley, the Town of
Needham and private businesses in the
marketingofrecyclables. Thishasalloweda
greater revenue stream to be produced for the
recyclables received. Through fees collected
for divisional services and marketing of the
recyclables during 2012, $240,00133. was
generated for the General Fund.
In 2012 the town continued to enjoy the
successes derived by making it easier for
residents to recycle. In addition to the
hazardous and hard to manage wastes
collected at the RRC, the center collected
397.11tons of  recyclables. Curbside
recyclables collected totaled 4814.05 tons
106.82 tons higher than 2011).  This
127
Page 152
Town of Framingham
represented an overall trash disposal cost
avoidance of $406,48.470.
WATER AND WASTEWATER
MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
The Water and Wastewater Program is
responsible for the provision of a drinking
water supply, a fire suppression service, and a
sewer collection service to the 70,000
residents of the community that it serves.
The Water Department is responsible for the
distribution of a public potable water supply
and for the provision of fire suppression
service to the 17,000 residential and
commercial accounts within the community.
The average daily water demand of nearly
seven million gallons per day ( mgd) is
purchased from the Massachusetts Water
Resources Authority (  MWRA) and is
subsequently distributed throughout the
Town by means of a complicated system of
pumps, pipes, valves, and reservoirs. The
Water Department program provides for the
maintenance and repair to the water
distribution infrastructure that includes; 250
miles of pipe, 17,000 service connections,
2,000 hydrants, 4,800 gate valves, 22,000
meters, 4  pumping stations, 3  booster
stations, and 6 above ground water tanks
having a storage capacity of nearly 9 million
gallons.
The Wastewater Department is responsible
for the collection and transport of 5 to 10
million gallons of sewage 
each day. A
significant portion of wastewater flow during
peak periods is infiltration and inflow ( I /I)
from sources such as leaking pipes and sump
pump discharges during wet weather. Sewage
is conveyed from town systems to the MWRA
which is charged with the transport and
treatment of sewerage from its forty -three
member communities. The Town's collection
system consists of 226 miles of gravity mains,
18 miles of force mains, 45 pump stations,
6,600 manholes, and over 40 miles of cross -
country sewer -line easements.
Public Works 
2012 Annual Town Report
The Division's capital improvement programs
have been substantially under - funded in
recent decades and, as a consequence, the
critical infrastructure has experienced ever
increasing incidents of failure. The system
continued to grow and expand over time, but
the funding for the aging and expanding
infrastructure did not keep pace with capital
needs. As a consequence, the Division was
historically engaged solely in performing
unscheduled maintenance and was unable to
devote resources to  perform critical
maintenance to the system. This is
underscored by the issuance of an
Administrative Consent Order ( ACO) and
Notice of Noncompliance by the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection ( MADEP) during March 2007.
The ACO requires the Town to undertake
major sewer construction and rehabilitation
projects over several years with the primary
focus of alleviating recurring sanitary sewer
overflows, a violation of State and Federal
law. The ACO has several other requirements
including increased staffing levels, major
equipment purchases, implementation of a
SCADA system to remotely monitor and
control pumping stations and strict reporting
requirements. It is anticipated that the key
components of the ACO will be completed
on schedule by the end of 2013. Failure to
comply with the conditions of the ACO can
result in administrative civil or criminal action.
The Department also faces the continuing
challenges of managing a 
second
Administrative Order originally issued by the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority in
2003. The MWRA Settlement Agreement
limits the level of sulfide that the Town is
authorized to discharge to the MWRA system
through operational efforts. Sulfide generation
can cause odor and corrosion problems in
sewers which sometimes can be catastrophic.
Activities which the Wastewater Department
performs to mitigate the generation of sulfide
include chemical dosing at  selected
wastewater pumping stations, targeted
collection system cleaning and inspection, and
128
Page 153
Town of Framingham
enforcement of  grease interceptor
requirements at food establishments. A major
cause of sulfide is the wastewater detention
time associated with the large number of
pumping stations and miles of associated
force main piping. 45 pumping stations and
19 miles of related sewer force main sewer.
The Department has reduced the number of
pumping stations in the last two years from 50
to 45 as part of its Capital program and
foresees the elimination of 3 more.
In recent years the Department of Public
Works has developed a professional and know
workforce at all levels and disciplines. This
progression has provided an opportunity to
identify and fully carry out capital projects of
limited scope from design through
construction using Public Works staff. This
practice not only provides the Town with a
significant cost savings over contracting for
these services but is used as a  tool for
continually training our employees.
Unfortunately we do experience a significant
turnover in personnel which leaves us
understaffed at many times.
The aforementioned construction activities
were in addition to the excavations required
by department staff to repair over 200 water
system failures and 160 sewer system failures
during the course of the year. Additionally the
Water and Wastewater Division responded to
1,900 first response calls when a customer was
in need of immediate assistance. The
Wastewater division, performed video
inspection of over 170,000 linear feet of sewer
pipe whereby the condition of the sewer is
documented using a camera unit which is
remotely controlled and travels through the
pipe. The inspection process reveals areas of
the system that have actual or potential
problems that may require repair or
replacement.
Twice each year 
the Water Department
Collects drinking water samples from fifteen
homes which are subsequently analyzed for
their lead content. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency has set the action level for
Public Works 
2012 Annual Town Report
lead in drinking water at 15 parts per billion
ppb),the level which triggers corrective
actions to be undertaken by the water
supplier. The results of our sampling program
have successfully met that goal once again
during 2012 as they have for the past several
years.
The Water Department also performs
approximately 900 bacteriological tests
annually to ensure the quality and protection
of the Town's drinking water. The Town
maintained continuous compliance
throughout the year with the Environmental
Protection Agency's standards related to
bacteria testing (Total Coliform Rule).

FLEET, FACILITIES AND
COMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM
The Fleet, Facilities and Communications
Program continues to provide a  critical
support service to various public works
programs and also provides vehicle and
equipment maintenance support to other
agencies within the Town. This Program is
accountable for; the development and
implementation of  professional fleet
management standards and practices, the
design and procurement of all public works
vehicles and equipment, and for providing
standardized maintenance management
practices for all public works facilities
including water, wastewater and pumping
stations. The Division is also charged with the
technical management of  the
telecommunications network and thereby
provides a critical service component to the
Department's Emergency Management
Response Plan.
The Fleet, Facilities, and Communications
Division's role is to provide logistical support
to the Department through the provision of
fully operational equipment, facilities and
telecommunications that together, ensure the
effective and efficient delivery of essential
services to the residents of the community.
These vital services include the provision of
public safety, public works, and public utility
functions for the residents of Framingham.

The Town continues to be one of three major
equipment and materials cache sites for the
Northeast Homeland Security Regional
Advisory Council (NERAC).
Fleet Management
In 2012 the Division researched, designed and
prepared specifications for the procurement
of the following specialized equipment: One
3.5 cubic yard loader with a plow and snow
blower attachment, two 40,000 GVW snow
fighting trucks with sanders, front plows and
center scrapers. Also included was one heavy
duty pickup with a plow, one medium duty
dump truck with a plow, four heavy duty
utility body trucks with plows, a heavy duty
cab &  chassis with a specialized valve gate
turner and a 72,000 GVW automated refuse
packer with a plow.
Technician training sessions continue both in-
house and off site to help keep our
technicians current with the ever changing
industry. Also the Fleet Supervisor and Parts
Manager attended Massachusetts Emergency
Management Hazmat Awareness (  HAZ01)
Training along with Incident Command
System 100 ( ICS -100) Training. The Parts
Manager also completed Resource
Management System Administrator (RMS -SA)
training. The Parts Manager also acquired a
Commonwealth of  Massachusetts,
Department of Environmental Protection
Underground Storage Tank (UST) Class A/B
Operator Certificate.
This was the sixth winter season a temporary
site was set up at the King School for
technicians who are assigned to the north side
of town during plowing events. This
continues to work very well in providing the
technicians a more functional area to work so
repairs can be performed more effectively and
reducing the vehicle's `out of service' time that
would occur travelling to and from the
Western Avenue facility.
In 2012, Fleet Services wrote 2 repair
orders, performed 455 scheduled preventative
Public Works 
2012 Annual Town Report
maintenance services and completed 179
Commonwealth of Massachusetts Registry of
Motor Vehicles Enhanced Emissions State
Inspections.
The Division also managed the acquisition
and distribution of more than 241,000 gallons
of gasoline and diesel fuel.
Fleet Services assisted the Police Department
with modifications to the jail cells and sent the
Department's Welder / Fabricator to the Fire
Department to instruct them on the use of
their new weldingequipment. He also
repaired one of their platform trucks snorkel
system.
Facility Maintenance
Again this year the Department of
Environmental Protection's Stage II Vapor
Recovery Certification program was
performed for the fuel system at Western
Avenue along with the annual calibration of
the fuel pumps which was performed by the
Town's Sealer of Weights & Measurers. The
oil /water separators at Western Avenue and
the Mt. Wayte recycling facility continue to be
inspected quarterly and pumped out in
compliance with DEP regulations as needed
but at least annually. We continue to perform
full load tests on the emergency/ standby
generators at both the Western Avenue and
Henry Street facilities. This is done quarterly
to insure proper operation along with a semi-
annual maintenance program. The annual fire
sprinkler inspection was performed at the
Western Avenue facility.
The main electrical transformer at the Mt.
Wayte Facility failed and was replaced with a
more energy efficient unit.
Energy efficient overhead doors were installed
at the Western Avenue facility to help
conserve energy and give more natural light to
the parking garages and the Fleet Service area.
The Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure Plans (SPCCP) are reviewed
131

annually to insure accuracy. This plan is
necessary so that there are guidelines in place
to respond to any type of uncontrolled release
of hazardous materials. This plan also includes
all of the town's pumping stations and the
Recycle and Disposal Facility.
Fleet Services continues to do a monthly
inspection of the Watson Place flood station
and performs any necessary repairs.
ADMINISTRATION & FINANCE
The Administration and Finance Division
provides for the consolidation of all
administrative and financial functions within
the Department ofPublicWorks. The
Division strives to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of financial and administrative

Collaborative (  MAPC) for a  Smart
Growth Plan Grant; MAPC was awarded
this grant and will start work on the Route
9 Plan in 2012. The scope of the plan
includes a collaboration effort between
Framingham, Natick, Southborough, and
Wellesley on a Route 9. The Route 9 plan
would further develop the
recommendations outlined in a recently
completed Route 9  Corridor Analysis
which determined that the development
potential of the Route 9 corridor under
current zoning could result in almost
doubling the current floor area, severely
exacerbating traffic congestion. The study
suggested that future development on
Route 9  should include more mixed
pedestrian and bicycle friendly
environment. The planning concept is to
create denser Smart Growth Opportunity
Areas that could also be better served by
public transportation and generate fewer
automobile trips than the current
development pattern.
ADMINISTRATION
The Board has continued to work with
the Town Treasurer's Office to require
prospective developers to  obtain
certification from the  Town's
Treasurer /Tax Collector that no local
taxes, fees, assessments or other municipal
charges are outstanding prior to
submission ofan application. As a result
of this process, many applicants have been
obligated to bring unsettled accounts up
to date before the Board would consider
their developmentproposals. Since first
employed in May of 1993, this noteworthy
process has been a source of substantial
uncollected taxes for the Town. By the
end of calendar year 2012 over $2.4
million had been collected to date through
these efforts.
In calendar year 2012, the Board collected
a total of $27 in revenue from
associated project review fees and from
Planning & Economic Development 
2012 Annual Town Report
the sale of Zoning By -Laws, Zoning
Maps, Subdivision Rules and Regulations,
and minor miscellaneous revenues. The
projects reviewed by the Board will create
hundreds of construction jobs. In
addition to actual off -site improvements
constructed by project applicants, the
Planning Board has also collected off -site
and on -site improvement obligations in
the amount of $4.M609 through CY2012
according to our most recent financial
report. Upon occupancy of these
projects, the net increase in positive tax
flow to the Town is estimated upwards of
63M.
In addition to these contributions to the
General Fund, the Planning Board obtains
significant Town -wide amenities through
the process of negotiatedmitigation. In
the course of its review the Planning
Board requires applicants to provide
improvements such as roadway widening
and reconstruction, signalization,
enhancements for public transportation
and landscaping to offset adverse project
impacts. Through calendar year2012the
Board received $ 130.20483. in direct
mitigation performance guarantees and
payments.
The Board continues to improve the
website to increase availability of the
information to the public. TheZoning

Town of Framingham  2012 Annual Town Report
The Community and Economic
Development Division (CED) undertakes
a wide variety of projects, all of which are
focused on protecting and enhancing the
quality of life for Framingham' s residents.
The projects are multi- dimensional,
ranging from securing grants and
providing policy analyses to promoting
homeownership and strengthening and
expanding the tax base by encouraging
appropriate new development and
supporting existing businesses.
The Division consists of three
departments: Planning, Zoning Board of
Appeals (  ZBA),  and Community
Development (  CD).  While each
department concentrates on different
planning functions, there are strong
interrelationships between and amongst
the departments as well as other municipal
divisions, boards and committees.
PLANNING DEPARTMENT
The Planning Department concentrates
on sound planning to promote economic
development and support our residential
neighborhoods. Planners manage a
variety of projects and provide policy
analyses for the Town Manager and Board
of Selectmen.
Economic Development
The department is  committed to
encouraging appropriate economic
development in order to support and
expand the tax base, thereby contributing
to the fiscal health of the town and
minimizing the tax burden on property
owners. Planners are responsible for
implementing the Town' s Economic
Development Strategic Plan, which is
based on the recognition of the critical
Planning & Economic Development 
roles that the commercial sector plays in
improving the quality of life for residents
by contributing to the tax base, providing
employment opportunities, and making
available a diversity of goods and services.
Consisting of four interconnected
components, the Plan is directed at:
identifying and planning for key sites and
districts, facilitating Town investment to
establish a  framework for the private
sector, creating a 
business friendly
environment, and marketing the town's
assets to attract new development and
redevelopment. The Planning
Department also supports the
implementation of the Master Plan,
adopted by the Planning Board in 2012.
Downtown Revitalization
The Planning Department coordinates
ongoing and planned projects to revitalize
Framingham's central business district.
The department works closely with the
Town Manager, Department of Public
Works, Building and Wires Department,
and Planning Board as well as state,
regional and federal agencies and
legislators to insure that all projects are
moving forward in a  coordinated and
expeditious manner.
Underlying the Town's approach to
improving the economic viability of
Downtown is the recognition that public
infrastructure improvements leverage
private investment. Publicinvestment is
directed at facilitating vehicular and
pedestrian circulation patterns, improving
safety, and beautifying the downtown as
well as 
upgrading water and sewer
infrastructure.
Working with DPW and its consultant as
well as the Town Manager, Board of
137
Page 162
Town of Framingham
Selectmen and Planning Board staff, the
Planning Department has helped guide
the development of a  long -term
revitalization strategy for the downtown
that addresses the rail crossing issue, seeks
to incorporate Farm Pond into the
downtown, promotes mixed -use transit -
oriented development, significantly
improves safety and traffic flow, and
enhances the physical appeal of the
downtown. The State is  currently
undertaking an Environmental Review of
a long -term plan to introduce a grade
separation into the downtown.
The Town has also developed plans to
effect significant vehicular and pedestrian
improvements to address traffic flow and
improve safety in the more immediate
future. These plans, combined with major
streetscape improvements to beautify the
downtown and help entice visitors to the
district are nearing the 75% completion
stage, with construction scheduled to
begin in 2014.
Framingham Downtown Renaissance
CED staff works closely with
Framingham Downtown Renaissance
FDR),a non -profit organization focused
on the revitalization of our downtown.
CED staff serves on all of the four
standing committees (Design, Promotion,
Economic Restructuring, and Organizing)
and participates in board of directors
meetings to provide support and insure
collaboration between FDR and Town
efforts and policies. In addition to staff
support, CED is contributing $30,000 in
federal) Community Development Block
Grant funds to further the goals of FDR.
With the help of the CDBG grant, FDR
hired Holli Andrews in the spring of 2012
to serve as Executive Director. Underher
leadership, FDR has achieved significant
and impressive successes in a short time,
including: generatingexcitementabout
Planning & Economic Development 
2012 Annual Town Report
Farm Pond and its proximity to
Downtown, creating and strengthening
partnerships with stakeholders,
successfully encouraging the MBTA to
improve its downtown property and
focusing attention on the historic
downtown railroad station. The results of
the strong collaboration between FDR
and CED exemplify the value of a genuine
public -private partnership.
Neighborhood Commercial Areas
The Planning Department continued its
efforts to encourage and facilitate the
revitalization of several neighborhood
commercial areas. CED engaged in
discussions with the property owner of
theNobscot Shopping Center. Further,
in response to ongoing support from the
division including sponsoring a  pre -
development meeting of all Town officials
engaged in the permitting process, the
owner of the Mt. Wayte shopping center
is developing plans to be presented to the
Planning Board to create a  mixed -use
development on  his  currently
underutilized property.
Brownfields Project
Framingham has a considerable number
of brownfields, which are properties that
contain or potentially contain hazardous
substances, pollutants or contaminants
that complicate the property's refinancing,
expansion orredevelopment. Brownfields
are not only a blighting influence on their
surroundings, but are typically
underutilized, thereby representing
enormous potential to generate significant
new property taxes once they are abated
or it is established that that they are not
contaminated.
Since 2008, the department has secured
and administered two $ 200,000 EPA
grants to identify, abate and eventually
redevelop brownfields. TheTownwas
awarded an additional $400,000 grant in
138
Page 163
Town of Framingham
May 2012 in response to an application
submitted by the division, allowing us to
continue the Town's Brownfields
Revitalization Program.
The Program involves identifying and
targeting sites, interfacing with property
owners, and working with a licensed site
professional (LSP) hired by the division to
conduct environmental site assessments
ESAs) of selected properties. The LSP
has undertaken eighteen ESAs including
two for the site on which a new branch
library is planned. One noteworthy project
entailed use of use of Brownfields funds
to assess an underutilized Parks and
Recreation Department parcel on Pratt
Street. The results allowed the Town, with
the support of the Agricultural Advisory
Committee, to establish a  community
garden in the summer of 2011 which
continued into 2012.
Appropriate Economic Development
New development is the only mechanism
available to expand the tax base in order
to reduce the financial burden on existing
property owners and /or increase the
availability of funding to improve
municipal services.
The department targets and promotes the
development of major parcels for
re)development throughout town.
Although the lack of available credit has
seriously undermined the progress of
several private developments, we are
focused on creating a  favorable
development environment and
encouraging redevelopment of vacant and
underutilized property in the downtown
and community -wide. Staffmonitors
property that is available for sale and
lease, responds to questions from
individuals and businesses interested in
locating in Framingham, and attempts to

work closely with state development
Planning & Economic Development 
2012 Annual Town Report
offices. Staff sits on interdepartmental
teams that review proposed development
proposals in order to facilitate the project
through the various review processes.
Staff also serves as an intermediary
between existing and prospective
businesses with other municipal
departments including Building,
Assessing, Police, Fire and Planning
Board. Planning Department staff has
developed strong and effective
relationships with major property owners
and serve as the "go -to" people in Town.
The planning and economic development
functions performed by staff are closely
interrelated with the work of the
Economic Development Industrial
Corporation ( FDIC). Staff and the EDIC
collaborate extensively in order to further
our shared commitment to promote
economic development.
Economic Development Industrial
Corporation ( FDIC).  The EDIC is
charged with creating a pro -active capacity
to plan for and carry out economic
development activities. In conjunction
with staff, the EDIC coordinated an
Economic Development Self- Assessment
Tool (  EDSAT) planning exercise
undertaken by Northeastern University's
Dukakis Center in order to evaluate the
Town's approach to  development.
Funded in part by the MetroWest
Chamber of Commerce, the EDSAT was
based on extensive data provided by
division staff as well as input from various
stakeholders. The EDSAT provided
important perspectives on how the Town
could build upon its assets and address its
weaknesses in order to attract and support
business activity. CEDinconjunction
with the FDIC, Town Manager and other
municipal departments are implementing

EDIC and CED have created an
internship program in conjunction with
Framingham State University in order to
take advantage of the considerable
resources offered by the university while
advancing Town economic development
objectives with minimal impact on the
municipal budget. We anticipate that, as a
result of our combined efforts, we will be
able to engage FSU interns with specific
interests and expertise in economic
development beginning in 2013.
Both CED and EDIC work closely with
the MetroWest Chamber of Commerce,
which is a strong and effective ally in our
efforts to strengthen the tax base. We
also maintain strong partnerships with
state and regional agencies as well as FDR.
Residential Neighborhoods
While economic development initiatives
support residential neighborhoods by
generating additional taxes, the Planning
Department enhances these efforts by
undertaking projects that specifically and
directly protect and improve
Framingham's neighborhoods. The
department continued to respond to a
Board of Selectmen policy that places a
priority on encouraging homeownership
and targeting efforts to vulnerable
neighborhoods. Both the Community

Programs are focused on improving
neighborhoods. The CD Coordinator
serves on the Town's Code Enforcement
Task Force in order to link federally
funded rehabilitation programs with the
Town' s efforts to  improve its
neighborhoods.
Neighborhood Stabilization Program
The dramatic increase in  home
foreclosures that began in 2008 started to
abate in 2012. The PlanningDepartment
continued to  implement the
Neighborhood Stabilization Program
NSP),funded by three grants secured and
administered by CED totaling $ 1.35
million. The mission ofNSP is to acquire
and convert foreclosed properties into
owner -occupied homes to reduce the
potential for blight and help stabilize
neighborhoods.
The success 
of NSP represents the
combined efforts of the Planning and CD
Departments, the Board ofSelectmen and
the Framingham Housing Authority
FHA) and its subsidiary, the Framingham
Housing Development Corporation.
Thus far, the Program has resulted in the
purchase of six homes, all of which have
been completely renovated and four of
which were sold to income -eligible
applicants in 2011 and 2012. One two -
family property was retained by FHA and
the sixth property is currently for sale. Net
sale proceeds are reinvested in the
purchase and renovation of additional
properties. Theserenovatedproperties
have dramatically improved the
appearance of the neighborhoods in
which they are situated and returned
abandoned properties to active uses that
contribute positively to  the
neighborhoods in which they are situated.

Town of Framingham
Promotion
Consistent with the Economic
Development Strategic Plan, a concerted
effort is underway to market the desirable
attributes of Framingham in order to
encourage individuals, families and firms
to locate, invest, and shop in our town.
Planners have developed a  marketing
campaign, a major component of which is
a  web site created and maintained in
conjunction with Technology Services.
The two divisions will continue to refine
the web site, which can be accessed at

State and Federal Grants
The Planning Department constantly
identifies and analyzes the applicability of
grants as well as researches the availability
offundingforspecificprojects. In 2012,
the department was awarded a $400,000
Brownfields Environmental Site
Assessment Grant from EPA to fund
ongoing and proposed brownfield
activities including redevelopment
planning.
The Planning Department is available to
provide staff support to other divisions in
identifying and preparing grant
applications.
Upon receipt of grants, CED administers
the grants to insure compliance with the
granting authority. Most notably, the
division is still responsible for insuring
that the Town complies with federal
guidelines and reporting requirements
regarding a $657,000 energy grant and a
200,000 EPA Brownfields Assessment
grant the Town received as part of the
Economic Stimulus ( ARRA) as well as
another $200,000 EPA grant that was not
ARRA funded. The ARRA grants
included additional reporting requirements
that resulted in more staff hours dedicated
to the project. Reimbursement for staff

time on administrative tasks depends on
the policies of the granting agency.
Policy Analyses, Studies, Project
Management, and Special Projects
CED undertakes projects, prepares policy
analyses, and coordinates inter-
departmental projects. Some of these
2012 projects include the following:
Wireless Communication Facilities
WCF) Working Group
The working group retained a consultant
in 2011 to review the towns wireless
communications facilities bylaw and
identify how the needs of the wireless
industry can be accommodated consistent
with federal law with the least impact to
our neighborhoods. The consultant
issued his report to the Town, which is
reviewing it  to determine appropriate
action.
Open Space and Recreation Plan
Implementation Committee ( OSRPIC)
The Planning Department staffs the
OSRPIC, which is  charged with
implementing the 2008 Open Space and
Recreation Plan. The committee completed
its study of the town's three aqueducts
Weston, Hultman, and Sudbury —and
assessed how best to provide public
access for recreational use. The committee
also initiated the state required update to
the 2008 Open Space and Recreation Plan.
Transportation
CED works closely with DPW to insure
that Framingham' s transportation
improvement priorities are identified on
the state's Transportation Improvement
Plan ( TIP),which is a prerequisite for
federal and state funding. The Senior
Planner serves as 
the Town' s TIP
Coordinator.

Cochituate Rail Trail (CRT)
The Planning Department is working
closely with DPW to coordinate design
and construction activities along the rail
trail together with sewer work under the
trail. Design plans for the trail were
submitted to MassDOT in 2011 and its
design review process is underway. The
25% design public hearing was conducted
in November. The PlanningDepartment
secured a $  600,000 MassDOT
transportation grant in 2010 to help
complete the trail. The basic
infrastructure of the trail is  nearing
completion as part of DPW' s East
Framingham Sewer Improvement Project.
It is anticipated that the CRT will be
completed in 2014.
Bruce Freeman Rail Trail (BFRT)
The Planning Department manages the
planning process to develop the
Framingham component of the proposed
35 -mile rail trail that will extend from
Lowell to Framingham. Thedepartment
has been seeking grant funding and
working with the regional committee
representing all of the communities
through which the trail will traverse.
Aqueducts
Planners are actively engaged in
improving public access to the Weston
Aqueduct. Aseriesofmeetingstook
place in 2012 with Town, regional and
Stateofficials. A pilot project for a
segment of the Weston Aqueduct in
Saxonville was opened to the public in
October.
Subsidized Housing Inventory (SHI)
The Planning Department carefully
monitors the Town's status on the
Commonwealth' s Subsidized Housing
Inventory in order to insure that
Framingham's subsidized housing units
are accurately and fully counted. The
Town's SHI remains in excess of 10 %,
Planning & Economic Development 
2012 Annual Town Report
which limits the applicability of Chapter
40B Comprehensive Permits ( subsidized
housing development that is not subject
to municipal Zoning Codes).The division
worked closely with the State as well as
current and prospective owners of the
Edmands House, a  subsidized housing
complex that was placed on the market in
2012. Final details are being negotiated to
insure that the units will be retained on
the SHI, the current residents protected,
and the property renovated.
Provide Support to Town Committees
CED provides staff support to several
Town committees in addition to the
FDIC, including (beginning in 2012) both
the Framingham Historic Commission
and the Framingham Historic District

The Zoning Board of Appeals ( ZBA) is
the Permit Granting Authority and the
Special Permit Granting Authority for
projects that do not meet the
requirements of the Town' s Zoning
Bylaws. The ZBA's function is  to
approve or deny requests for variances
and special permits, and issue findings
through the public hearing process by
determining if the required criteria, as
stated in the Zoning Bylaw, have been
met. The ZBA also administers the
Comprehensive Permit process for
affordable housing as set forth under
M.L. G.Chapter 40B.
The ZBA is  a  three- member Board
appointed by the Selectmen. In 2012, Full
Members of the Board were Philip R.
Ottaviani, Jr.,Chair; Susan S. Craighead,
Vice - Chair; and Stephen E. Meltzer,
Clerk. Karl Thober, Edward (  Ted)
Cosgrove, Robert Snider and Kevin
Gatlin served as Associate Members.
Eugene Kennedy, Assistant Director of
Community and Economic Development,
serves as the ZBA Administrator. Mr.
Kennedy, with support from Planner John
Szczesny, prepared the Board's decisions
and advised the Board on procedural and
other issues. Alice Clapper continued her
duties as Administrative Assistant. Town
Counsel advised the Board as required.
Total filing fees in 2012 amounted to
26,300. These funds go directly into the
General Fund.
Forty -two petitions were filed with the
ZBA office in 2012. Seven petitions that
were filed in 2011 were decided in 2012. 
Of the 49 cases heard in 2012, 21 were
requests for variances, 16 for special
permits, 3 for findings, 7 for variance and
special permits, and 2 appeals of the
decision of the Building Commissioner.
Variance and special permit requests
included those for relief from dimensional
requirements for: construction of, and
additions to, single family homes;
placement of sheds on residential
properties; construction of two- family
residences and automotive and restaurant
uses; and changes of use 
for local
businesses. Some of these filings were the
outcome of changes in zoning districts in
past years resulting in non -conforming
lots.
Three Associate Members presided over
sign appeal applications, with the fourth
Memberselected as 
theAlternate. Ten
sign applications were filed in 2012.
The Board generally meets on the second
Tuesday of every month at 7:00 P.M. in
the Blumer Room. Members of the public
are welcome and encouraged to attend.

over 21 million dollars in Federal
Community Development Block Grant

HOME) funds, which must be used
exclusively for  developing and
rehabilitating residential units. In
combination, the programs seek to: arrest
deterioration in the housing stock and
stabilize neighborhoods through financial
and technical rehabilitation assistance to
property owners; develop programs to
preserve and expand affordable housing
opportunities; eliminate architectural

barriers; improve Town -owned facilities
and infrastructure to prolong their useful
lives and stabilize eligible neighborhoods;
improve the quality of life for low and
moderate income residents through the
provision of social services; and
administer the programs effectively and
equitably to ensure that all members of
the community may participate in or
benefit from program activities.
The following summarizes several major
accomplishments during 2012:
Housing Rehabilitation Assistance
The program provides technical assistance
and CDBG /HOME loans for the
rehabilitation ofsubstandard homes. Six
dwellings were repaired with the help of
grants and loans to income -eligible
property owners (  those with low or
moderate incomes or a majority of tenants
with low or moderate incomes) in 2012.
An additional six properties are in the
process of receiving rehabilitation loans.
Administrative support is provided the
Planning Department to implement the
Neighborhood Stabilization Program
NSP),which acquires, rehabilitates and
sells foreclosed property with funds
acquired through a state grant program.
Homebuyer Assistance
The CD Department continues to
administer and promote the Town' s
Down Payment Assistance Program.
Unfortunately, no grants were provided
during 2012 because of lack of demand
undoubtedly attributable at least in part to
theeconomy. Thisprogram islinkedto
the Division's NSP Program by making
available potential funding for income -
eligible homebuyers as an added incentive
to purchase foreclosed properties in order
to eliminate blight from residential
neighborhoods.
Planning & Economic Development 
2012 Annual Town Report
Code Enforcement
While the CD Coordinator serves on the
Town's Code Enforcement Task Force,
the department also provides financial
assistance to  code enforcement.
Specifically CDBG funds reimburse the
Building Department for the equivalent of
one full -time staff person for time spent
inspecting residential properties in Census
Block Groups with populations that are
predominantly low or moderate incomes.
During the past program year, over 409
inspectional cases were initiated and
closed with the assistance of CDBG
funds.
Public Facilities Improvements
CDBG grants continued to fund several
handicapped accessibility improvements
to Memorial Building, including the
installation of a mobile ADA stage lift in
Nevins Hall; the reconstruction of Saint
Lo Street; and construction of accessible
sidewalks, pathways and pedestrian
crossings at the Juniper Hill School.
CDBG funds were also used to upgrade
public parks and recreational facilities
including the installation of new lighting
and landscaping at Butterworth Park.
Economic Development and
Facade /Sign Improvement Program
In 2012, CDBG funds were provided to
help fund the salary of the Executive
Director of FDR's Main Street Program.
In its inaugural year, this program helped
twenty (20) local businesses that serve area
residents. Assistance was also offered to
the owners of an historic mixed -use
property in Framingham's central business
district to renovate the ground -floor
facade to its original condition.
In response to a successful application
developed by the CD Department and
endorsed by the Board of Selectmen, the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) has designated the
144
Page 169
Town of Framingham
area around the intersection of Route 126
and 135 as  a "  Neighborhood
Revitalization Strategy Area" ( NRSA).
This designation accords the Town
significantly more flexibility in applying
CD funds to promote economic
development in the downtown.
Public Services
CDBG funds supported the following
youth initiatives: a summer employment
and counseling program (  Community
Connections Summer Work Program);
and a special program for high school
students facing issues that impeded their
ability to learn and achieve (Resiliency for
Life).Adult programs included: literacy
training (Literacy Unlimited);English -as-
a- Second Language ( Framingham Adult
ESL Plus);prevention of homelessness
Homeless Prevention Program); and
referrals to health insurance coverage and 
2012 Annual Town Report
social services ( MAPS Inc.).Over 519
individuals were served by the activities.
Subsidized Housing Support
CDBG and HOME funds supported on-
going renovation of the Framingham
Housing Authority's Memorial House (2
units) in order to convert it from a
congregate housing facility to a  more
traditional form of housing.
Administration
Administration of both the CDBG and
HOME Programs is staff -intensive and
requires diligence to identify and comply
with applicable federal regulations.
CDBG and HOME funding reimburse
the Town for the salaries of benefits of
staff assigned to manage the programs.

The MetroWest RTA was created by a
vote of the Framingham and the Ashland
Boards of Selectman in December of
2006. By the summer of 2007, seven
additional communities had joined, a
budget and fares were put in place, and an
Administrator was hired to oversee the
daily operation of the LIFT which had
been under the Framingham Planning
Department. MWRTA "  fixed route" 
service was then initiated on December
1s`,2007 with a new contracted provider
and 10 new buses obtained from Federal
and State grants. At the same time, the
MWRTA was 
paying the MBTA to
continue its RIDE service in the
Framingham and Natick area.
In 2008, the original Framingham LIFT
and the Natick Neighborhood bus routes
were integrated into a  unified transit

system. That year, Marlborough and
Southborough joined MWRTA,
expanding demand response service
delivery by 2,000 rides a month.
In 2009, the Authority, through a Federal
grant, expanded again to create a link to
the Woodland MBTA Station in Newton
Route #1) setting the stage for using the
Charlie Card system wide. Additionally,
the Authority took over the MBTA's
RIDE provision in Framingham and
Natick expanding again the demand
response provision by another 5,000 rides
a month.
In 2010, the Authority, using state and
federal funds, purchased and rehabilitated
a facility at 37 Waverly St. which has
served as the " Hub" and maintenance
depot for the system. In 2011, Wellesley
joined the Authority as its 12 member.
Additionally the MWRTA began
collaboration with Framingham State
University, supporting a student operated 
2012 Annual Town Report
system with capital and training that is
fully funded by the University.
In  2012, MWRTA executed a
lease /purchase with SMOC for its
building on 15 Blandin Ave. with the
intention of moving its entire maintenance
and operations facility to that location.
The Authority will also create options for
community access to parts of the facility.
The MWRTA will continue to build upon
the over 500,000 rides provided in FY12
by using technology, an emphasis on
customer service and the more effective
and efficient delivery of transportation
service. Forfurtherdetailsandforreal

Commission
Barry Bograd served as chairman with
members Robert Brown, Dan Jones, Joan
Rastani and Kevin Salvi.
The Annual Town Meeting voted for an
annual FY13 level service operating
budget of $ 2,021415, for Parks
Administration, Maintenance and
Recreation.
With support from the Capital Budget
Committee and Town Meeting, the
department purchased a new F350 4x4
utility truck. Vehicle replacement has
lagged behind and continues to be a
concern. Other capital improvements
included new Playground Safety Mulch to
replace existing materials throughout the
parks, the completion of Furber Park
Improvements, and the completion of
computerized irrigation at the athletic
fields. The Department continues to hold
payments on the General Contractor for
the Bowditch Field Athletic and Cultural
Complex until corrective masonry work
and other deficiencies are completed.
Beautification projects were implemented
throughout the Town with the use of a
construction supervisor position that has
been refocused on coordinating volunteer
labor. The most noticeable areas included
the John Costanza Park in Saxonville,
Eames Square located off Union Avenue,
Walsh Park at the intersection of Routes
30 and 126 as well as additional plantings
throughout Cushing Memorial Park. In
Recreation &  Cultural Affairs 
addition, the Community Garden at Pratt
Street increased the number of plots and
added additional irrigation.
The Park and Recreation Commission and
the Massachusetts Water Resources
Authority entered into an agreement to
open the Weston aqueduct for public use.
The area connects northern Saxonville
with Nobscot and runs from Elm Street
to WaterStreet. Stewardship of the 1.1
mile linear park was accepted by the Parks
and Recreation Commission and a new
advisory committee was established. This
agreement is the first in the State and will
serve as a pilot program for the rest of the
Commonwealth. The Parks and
Recreation Commission sponsored Article
15 at the Annual Town meeting to enter
into a 99 year lease for the use of 6.5 acres
located at 21 Edgebrook Road. The
article was voted and agreed that the
property will be maintained as a natural
wooded park.
The addition of formalized trails at the
aqueduct, and passive recreation areas like
the Edgebrook property and Cushing
Memorial Park represent a  trend and
transition of the department that is more
comprehensive, serving the varying
recreational interests of the community.
Other tasks approved by the Parks and
Recreation Commission included the
opening of a  renovated playground at
Furber Park; the review of park use and
refund policies; the implementation of
credit card use; new signage at various
151
Page 176
Town of Framingham
parks and the completion of Phase 4 at
Cushing Memorial Park.
Over 500 events were scheduled at the
Bowditch complex this year. Stadium
highlights included a concert featuring the
United States Air Force Band of Liberty,
two movie nights, the Girl Scouts of
America 100' anniversary picture,
Mavericks Semi Pro Football games, the
traditional Thanksgiving eve bonfire as
well as a host of high school and college
athletic events. Of particular note was a
visit by the Brazilian World Cup Soccer
Team that played an exhibition game
against Franklin Peirce College on
Thursday, March 29, 2012. The high
quality natural turf was a main reason for
this site selection by the visiting Brazilian
Officials.
The Department continues to hold over
550,000 on the Bowditch Field General
Contractor. Contract specifications have
not been met and center mostly on
masonry and concrete work.
We would like to thank Town Meeting,
the many Town boards, committees,
departments and volunteers for
supporting our services. We would also
like to thank the hundreds of user
organizations and volunteers for their
continued support.

Recreation
The Recreation Department provides over
200 formal programs geared towards a
varied population including adults, youth,
seniors, preschool and those with special
needs. Services are provided through a
combination of user fees and public tax
Recreation &  Cultural Affairs 
2012 Annual Town Report
dollars. During the past year, we offered
266 different programs with a
participation of 17,412. During the
summer, the beaches experienced a 3%
increase from the previous summer for
about 20,000 visitors. In addition to
establishing a new credit card system for
registration, we 
have several new
programs offerings such as the Start and
Turn Swim Clinic, Futsal Soccer as well as
additional school vacations offerings.
The department sponsored some special
events this year with assistance of Friends
ofFramingham Recreation. The highlights
included Pumpkins in the Park, Green Up
Day, the Egg -citing Egg Hunt, Movie
Night at Bowditch, Open House at
Cushing Park for the unveiling of the
historical plaques, O'sConnell' Motorcycle
Run, the 911 ceremony at Cushing
Memorial Park and the traditional
Thanksgiving Eve Bonfire. These events
continue to grow in popularity and size.
For the second year, we managed the ever
popular "Friday Night Concerts on the
Green."The eight week schedule of local
talent included the sounds of Off the Hook,
XRB, Heritage Pops, Broadsword and the
Reminisants. Once again, the weather
prevented two bands from performing:
Amy Galaltin and the Cocoacabana. There
was a special performance of the United
States Air Force Band of Libery held at the
Bowditch Athletic &  Cultural Complex.
Concerns about the location of the stage
in 2011 were addressed in 2012 and the
crowds were pleased with the new
placement of the stage in the north
quadrant of the park. We are grateful to
the many sponsors who made this event
possible.
The PAL basketball league led by Director
Alan Williams challenged New England
Patriots players Rasi Dowling, Patrick

in an exciting game of basketball. The
final score of the game was 79 to 64 with
the win going to the young PAL players.
Grants that enhanced our 2012 programs
included The Department of
Conservation and Recreation for the
Massachusetts Park Pass; the Impact
Grant and other sponsors that generously
donated money for the Concert Series;
Future Skills funded two summer
counselors for our Recreation Centers
while Project Bread and the United States
Department of Agriculture Food and
Nutrition Service provided free breakfast
and lunch for the Recreation Special
Needs Program. We thank them for all
this assistance. In addition, we thank the
Sudbury River Tennis Club for their
generous donation to help defray the cost
of  the summer tennis lessons.
Additionally, Friends of Framingham
Recreation was able to grant numerous
scholarships for Recreation Programs to
families in need.
It is with a heavy heart that we will be
saying goodbye to our long time swim and
beach director Grace Ciocca. She has
served in limitless capacity for the past 20
years andwill be greatlymissed. Wewish
her much enjoyment during her
retirement.
We would like to thank the Town
Selectmen, Town Meeting Members,
Town Staff and numerous community
volunteers for their support and
dedication. Without their continued
support, we would not be successful in
offering quality programs to the residents.
We welcome input from Town residents
and we value both your feedback and
involvement in our programs.

Parks Maintenance
The Parks Maintenance Department
prides itself with providing some of the
best maintained recreational facilities in
the Metro West area. Maintenance of our
athletic fields consists of an affordable
program that focuses on the basics of
aerating top dressing, fertilizing, seeding,
and proper irrigation.
The maintenance program is combined
with a concentrated management effort
and well thought out scheduling program
that includes field scheduling policies,
consistent practices, and established
priorities. The results allow Framingham
to maintain high quality fields while
hosting over 15,000 formally scheduled
events per year.
Included in our scheduling and support
are the full athletic programs for three
high schools and two colleges and a wide
variety of community and youth group
activity.
The department has expanded its
maintenance responsibilities by
developing maintenance programs for the
newly acquired 6.5 acre Edgebrook Road
property in addition to some maintenance
responsibilities for passive walking trails
on the Weston Aqueduct. Our town wide
beautification effort has been enhanced
through active recruitment of donated
labor and traffic island sponsors. We also
successfully handled our responsibility for
the Concerts on the Common series for a
second year.
We continue our working relationship
with Keefe Technical School. The
electrical lab provided labor for some
small lighting projects as well as electrical
improvements at some of the facilities in
the past year. This program affords
153
Page 178
Town of Framingham
students the benefit of actual experiences
in a commercial setting.
Infield renovations of the two highly used
Winch softball fields were completed in
the fall. The renovations improved and
repaired the poor drainage and the uneven
play areas from the fields which in turn
also renovated the soccer area that is used
within the outfield of the two fields. In
addition, we continue our efforts in
renovating many of our playground "fall
zones" areas by replacing traditional wood
chips with safety zone wood fiber mulch
that was obtained through capital funding.
In addition, we 
continue the sign
installation at our parks and properties
which allows patrons and residents to
make the connection between the service
and the department whose responsibility it
is to manage them.
Last spring, we embarked on an
experimental project at the high school
side athletic field. The field was laser
graded to insure proper drainage and was
renovated with experimental grass
varieties. These varieties require less
dedicated maintenance; i.e.  water,
fertilization and cutting. In  late
September, the football program started
to use the area with little damage to the
surface. We anticipate increased fielduse
by the lacrosse program in the spring and
will then be able determine if this project
is a viable alternative.
We were able to purchase a new vehicle
for our fleet through our Capital Budget
Program. Our vehicle replacement
program continued to lag behind due to
funding considerations. In addition, we
completed the upgrades and renovations
to the Furber Park playground and
basketball court as well as providing
handicap access to the area. 
2012 Annual Town Report
The Department continues to work with
the Agricultural Committee on the
community garden program at the Pratt
Street property as well as at the prison.
These areas are used by local residents
allowing an opportunity for them to
cultivate their own produce.
We continue our active tree maintenance
program working on the removal of
hazardous trees and the pruning of trees
for safety and structural reasons.
Hurricane Sandy created a lot of tree
damage in October. Our department
spent about 340 man hours to clean up
storm damage to parks and school areas
within our purview.
We would like to thank all the volunteers
and volunteer groups that worked with us
over the year. Their support is  a
tremendous resource. In turn, we offer
support and resources to other town
departments. We also thank other town
departments for their cooperation as well;
it would be very difficult for us to achieve
these successes without their help.

moratorium on the general sale of new
lotswhich isstillineffect. Feeschedules
for associated cemetery activities were
raised and approved last year and are
considered current. In addition, the
increase in requests for historical records
associated with the cemeteries continues.
The three hill side crypts at Main St.
Cemetery have started to crumble and fall
into disrepair. We have received repair
estimates between $80,000 and $120,000
for complete restoration. We will be
requesting a capital budget appropriation
next year and will involve the Historical
Commission in any plans to repair.

Loring Skating Arena
In its 50"'year of operation, Loring Arena
continues to improve the infrastructure
and maintain the rink to high standards.
Some improvements this year included
updating the front men's and ladies'
rooms with new sinks, Corian countertops
and faucets which replaced the original
fixtures. In addition, two new showers
Recreation &  Cultural Affairs 
2012 Annual Town Report
were installed in locker room " A"
replacing the 30+ year old ones. We have
received many compliments from patrons
regarding these improvements.
The arena also replaced the 28 metal
halide lights over the ice surface and
cleaned the shields that protect the lights.
The lights had approximately 12,000
hours of use and were producing about
50% of their original light output. The
work was completed by arena staff.
The arena recently purchased several
different sized tempered glass panels at a
cost of $ 4,969. Our replacement
inventory now covers every size panel
needed to keep the arena going.
The six original entrance doors were
replaced by new energy efficient insulated
doorswithlocks. Thenewdoorsare
building code compliant and allow for
easier control of who enters the building
as well as creating a safer atmosphere for
patrons.
A new control panel was installed by
North East Distributors. The control
panel is the "heart" of the refrigeration
system and controls pumps, compressors,
condenser water and fan, ammonia and
rink ice temperature. The new panel
calls out" to arena staff to alert them of
anymalfunction that may occur. The new
panel is already showing a reduction in
electricity usage.
The two end walls to the barrel roof of
the arena were refurbished and painted
through a capital appropriation by Town
Meeting for a total cost of $32,000. A
more permanent solution is being pursued
as these end walls are 50 years old and
need replacement. The work consisted of
scraping all the metal supports to remove
rust and chipping pieces, applying a coat
of sealant to slow the corrosion of the
155

metal and then applying a coat of paint to
the metal and the panels.
Dave Friday retired from the Loring
Arena Committee after many years of
dedicated service. Framingham resident
and new committee member Robert
Lewis was appointed by the Board of

Council on Aging /Callahan
Senior Center
The Council on Aging and Callahan
Senior Center exists to promote healthy,
successful aging for senior citizens. This
mission is  carried out by providing
programs, services, information and
referrals, social service outreach in many
areas including financial, medical, housing,
transportation, emotional support and
estate planning.
Presently we are staffed with four full time
and 12 part time employees and are
funded by grants from the state and
private foundations. In addition, there are
thousands of hours donated by
volunteers. The Friends ofCallahan is a
non -profit, 501(3C)program that raises
funds to assist the center in offering its
many programs and activities.
Our activities and programs saw an
increase of about 4,000 people between
Recreation &  Cultural Affairs 
2012 Annual Town Report
2011 and 2012. The travel program saw an
increase as well and offered 47 trips.
Approximately 335 pieces of durable
medical equipment were loaned to seniors
at no charge. We have 11 support groups
offered monthly to more than 185 seniors.
The Friends of Callahan monthly $4
luncheon for seniors catered by Mark
Curtis of American Eagles Grille has
increased to twice per month.
We've worked with 40 eligible seniors in
receiving a credit of up to $725 on their
property tax bills through volunteering at
town departments in a variety of ways via
the Senior Property Tax Work Off
Program. In addition, we assist seniors
who qualify for fuel assistance with new
applications to this program.
Volunteerism
The SHINE program along with many
volunteers provided more than 950
sessions of assistance regarding health
insurance information to seniors. In
addition, many training sessions were held
for volunteers throughout the year.
Volunteers were recruited from local
businesses, religious groups, parents,
teachers and students of several area
schools to provide yard cleanup for about
15 senior households. In addition, Fuller
Middle School had 20 students and two
teachers volunteer to tutor the seniors in
the use of electronic devices.
The Callahan Center continues to offer
numerous intergenerational programs by
partnering with students and teachers
from a 
variety of local schools. A
sampling of partnering included Miriam
McCarthy School raised funds to donate
to the Kate McSweeney Homeless Fund;
Brophy School provided Intergenerational
Bingo to the seniors; Fuller Middle School
156

Town of Framingham
offered electronics clinics; Keefe
Technical School provided services and
assistance during our Jewels of
Framingham program and our Heart
Healthy program.
Multiculturalism
An intern from U -Mass Lowell connected
with several seniors originally from India
who live in Framingham and had never
come to the center before. Several events
were held to encourage their participation
and connect with other seniors in their
community. ESOL classes for the Asian
community of elders are held twice a
week.
New events and happenings in
2012
Continuing Connections debuted in
March as a weekly group session for
participants with a  diagnosis of
Alzheimer's accompanied by their care
partners for an innovative approach to
addressing the physical, emotional,
cognitive and financial issues presented by
this disease. The program was initiated
thanks to the previous Director, Mary
Parcher and generous funding by the
Friends of Callahan. BayPath Elder
Services is supplementing some expenses
through the Tide III -E grant program.
Area restaurants have been generous in
their support of the group's excursions for
lunch sessions.
Another program supported by BayPath
Elder Services through its Tide III -B fund
is an effort to recruit volunteers to be
medical escorts to seniors in need of
transportation to medical appointments.
The funding will allow for mileage
reimbursement for volunteers who will
provide a much needed service to seniors
with heath issues. 
2012 Annual Town Report
Framingham Rotary Club contributed
500 toward the purchase of air
conditioners for seniors living in public
housing and in addition, hosted a pancake
breakfast in November that raised
additional funds for this effort, which will

SCHOOL COMMITTEE
FY13 Budget
The School Committee spent the first
several months of the year in budget
deliberation. In April 2012, the School
Committee voted an FY13 budget request
to Town Meeting of $96,000. 600, As part
of its FY13 budget, the School Committee
supported tuition -free, full -day
kindergarten, effective with the
2012/2013 school year, to ensure that all
kindergarten students have an equitable,
meaningful start in the Framingham
Public Schools. TheSchool Committee' s
budget request was supported by Town
Meeting.
In October 2012, the Special Town
Meeting was charged with allocating 
additional state revenues received by the
Town. Town Meeting voted to increase
the School Department' s annual budget
appropriation by $ 996,825. These
additional revenues enabled the district to
increase the hours of 26 kindergarten
classroom aides; establish three
administrative internships; and increase
the amount of days for the 10 -month
elementary school office managers, among
other district rebuilding needs. In
addition, some funds were designated for
professional development and collective
bargaining salary reserves.
New Superintendent
In February 2012, the School Committee
voted unanimously to hire Dr. Stacy Scott
as Superintendent of the Framingham
Education & Libraries  158
Page 183
Town of Framingham
Public Schools. In announcing the
appointment, School Committee members
cited Dr. Scott's passion for education,
work ethic, educational leadership skills,
and broad background of experience as
important factorsinthedecision. Dr.
Scott's superintendency began on July 1,
2012.
In June, the School Committee thanked
outgoing Superintendent Steven Hiersche
for his three -year tenure. School
Committee members noted that the
district had been through some difficult
fiscal times during this period, but the
district was on the ascent due to the hard
work of Dr. Hiersche and his staff.
Legislative Advocacy
The School Committee proposed several
resolutions which were approved at the
annual meeting of the Massachusetts
Association of School Committees
MASC) in Hyannis in November 2012.
Affirmatively voted resolutions drive
MASC's legislative agenda. A
Framingham proposal to increase Circuit
Breaker funding to cover the cost of
educating district students in out -of
district placements from 75% of the cost
after 4 times the foundation amount to
100% was 
passedunanimously. If a
legislative initiative to modify the Circuit
Breaker formula is successful, itwould
significantly impact future state revenues
to the Town of Framingham and its
public schools.
In October, the School Committee voted
to write letters to every Massachusetts
senator and congressman urging them to
rescind the federal sequestration
provisions of the Budget Control Act of
2011 before those measures took effect
on January 1, 2013. The School
Committee cited strong concerns about
the across - the -board cuts that could
impact critical programs such as Tide I
Education and Libraries 
2012 Annual Town Report
grants for disadvantaged students and
special education grants under the
Individuals with Disabilities Education
Act.
FPS Policy Manual
In July 2012, the School Committee
completed a cover -to -cover review of the
School Committee's Policy Manual with
technical assistance from the
Massachusetts Association of School
Committees. The Policy Manual is now
posted online and easily accessible to staff
and the public through the district' s
website. The new online Policy Manual
features direct printing of policies; hot link
references to legal citations from
Massachusetts General Laws; multiple
search capabilities by key word, phrase,
and policy code; and paperless publication
of School Committee policy updates.
Fuller -Farley Building Question
Last fall, the School Committee held a
series of workshops to provide an
opportunity for Town officials and
community members to hear reports from
the New England School Development
Council (  NESDEC) on  recent
Framingham Public Schools enrollment
projections and a School Facilities Study
CapacityAnalysis. Overthenext 5years,
NESDEC projects that the district' s
elementary enrollment will increase by 300
students. Further, NESDEC reported
that the district's elementary schools are
currently at or near planned operating
capacity and a " space crunch" already
exists. Bargmann Hendrie +  Archetype
architects made a presentation on the
condition of Fuller Middle School and
Farley School. Bargmann Hendrie
reported that Fuller Middle School, built
in 1958, is nearing the end of its useful life
as a  school. The Fuller building
infrastructure is  in poor condition.
Doors, hardware and other components
do not meet Massachusetts Architectural
159
Page 184
Town of Framingham
Access Board (  MAAB) and ADA
Americans with Disabilities Act)
accessibility requirements. Bargmann
Hendrie (Bh +a) concluded that without a
major building renovation, Fuller Middle
School's current capital needs would be at
least $10 million, but that would only
address the immediate building needs
without addressing the need for a modern,
21s` century educational program. Bh +a
discussed options including renovation
and new construction, as 
well as a
redevelopment option that could include
the Farley building. Bh +a also presented
a Long -Range Capital Plan (10 Years and
beyond) which included an annual capital
expenditure by school and major capital
projects projection for the years 2012
through 2036.
In January 2013, the School Committee
will make a decision on submission of a
Statement of Interest to the Massachusetts
School Building Authority to inform the
MSBA about deficiencies at Fuller School
that inhibit delivery of the district' s
educational programs.
The Committee
In April 2012, Heather Connolly was
elected to a  one -year term to fill the
vacant seat of Richard Finlay, who

election meeting in April, the School
Committee elected David Miles as Chair,
Beverly Hugo as Vice Chair, and Carol
Phalen as Clerk.
In closing, the School Committee would
like to thank the district's teachers, staff,
administrators, Town officials andBoards,
Town Meeting, and the community -at-
large for their continued support for the
students of Framingham Public Schools.

SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS
There were three major themes that
characterized School Year 2011 -12 —
transitions, planning and rebuilding. The
first major theme was transitions. After
months of  analysis and many
presentations to the School Committee
and various Town Boards and
Committees, the decision was made to
transition from half -day Kindergarten to
full dayKindergarten. In order to make
this transition, the School Department
needed "bridge" funding that would allow
for the implementation of full day
Kindergarten in school year 2012 -13
despite the fact that the state
reimbursement for such a  transition
would lag the implementation by one year.
A strong educational case was made that
showed how students who participate in
full day kindergarten perform at a higher
level than those who do not. Happily,
Town Meeting supported the allocation of
funds to allow for full day Kindergarten
starting in September, 2012.
In addition to preparing for full day
Kindergarten, the district also relocated its
BLOCKS preschool from its former
location at King School to Juniper Hill
School, which had been home of some
school offices and two tenants — Accept
Transportation and the MetroWest Jewish
Day School. The relocation ofBLOCKS
Preschool to Juniper Hill School gave the
students access to a one -story facility (as
opposed to the four -level King School)
along with a state -of -the —art playground
160
Page 185
Town of Framingham
specifically designed for preschoolers.
This relocation also opened the way for
the School Administration to consolidate
from three different locations across the
Town back to the King School where they
had once been located.
Lastly, the School Committee was given
notice in the fall of 2011 that the
Superintendent did not intend to renew
his contract. The School Committee
interviewed several search firms and chose
Future Management Systems to assist
them in their search for a  new
Superintendent. After a  long and
successful search, the School Committee
hired Dr. Stacy L. Scott as their new
Superintendent who began work in July,
and the transition of leadership of the
district was smooth and orderly.
The second major theme was planning.
After three successive years of increased
enrollment at the Kindergarten level, it
was evident that a trend was emerging that
would have consequences for the School
Department' budget aswellas its facilities.
The Long Range Facility Plan that was
developed in 2010 was revisited as a result
of this enrollment trend, and the New
England School Development Council
NESDEC) was commissioned to update
enrollmentprojections. TheLongRange
Facility Plan had been developed with the
assumption that Farley Middle School,
which had been leased to MassBay
Community College since 1993, would
revert back to the School Department at
the expiration ofitslease in2013. The
Plan further assumed that Fuller Middle
School, which was reaching the end of its
useful life having been built in 1958,
would be closed and the students
relocated to Farley Middle School as early
as 2014. In December 2011, the School
Committee organized a  tour of both
schools, which occupy a single campus
site on Flagg Drive, and all Town Boards
Education and Libraries 
2012 Annual Town Report
and Committees were invited to attend.
After the tour, a debriefing meeting with
these Boards and Committees raised
concerns about the plan to close Fuller
and relocate the students to Farley. While
Farley was a  newer building ( built in
1973),it had some serious deficiencies in
terms of educational space, especially
since the College had reconfigured many
of interior spaces during their almost 20
years ofoccupancy. Another concernwas
whether the College would continue to be
located in Framingham once they left the
Farley campus. The Town Manager and
the Superintendent of Schools met with
the President of the College to assess their
interest in remaining in Framingham, and
it was clear that all parties wished to have
the College continue to be located in
Framingham. However, because there
was no specific site to relocate the College
in Framingham, it was agreed that the
College would remain at the Farley School
until an alternate site in Framingham
could be identified. With the backdrop of
increasing student enrollment at the
Elementary School level, the School
Department began to reassess its options
not only for accommodating enrollment
growth, but also to accommodate the fact
that Farley School would not be placed in
service for the School Department until
2015 at theearliest. Once again, the
School Committee engaged NESDEC to
conduct a  demographic study of the
Town along with an assessment of school
building capacities so that a revised facility
plan can be developed in light of these
newrealities. Thesereports indicate that
the development of the Fuller /Farley
campus may yield both short -term as well
as longer -term benefits for the district as it
looks ahead to its future.
The third major theme that emerged was
that of rebuilding the district's school
system. The economic downturn that
began in 2008 impacted the Town and its
161
Page 186
Town of Framingham  2012 Annual Town Report
ability to fully fund services as they had in
the past. In addition, state funding for
education became heavily dependent upon
federal stimulus funding, but even those
increases were not enough to help
Framingham avoid an economic strain
that resulted in budget decreases and
layoffs. The loss ofover 50 positions in
the School Department in FYI was
accompanied by other cuts to programs
andservices across thedistrict. Evenwith
flat salaries and "give backs" by many of
the school unions, the toll on the schools
was very evident. However, in FY12, the
district was buoyed by the fact that the
Massachusetts Legislature was doing its
best to help school districts stem the tide
of losses and cuts and state aid began to
increase. Asweprepared ourbudgets for
FY13, it was clear that we had seen the
worst of the economic downturn and we
could once again begin to rebuild the
school system that had experienced such
hardship. The School Committee worked
hard to present a responsible plan for
rebuilding the district and clearly
identified areas that would be targeted for
rebuilding. Fortunately, Town Meeting
overwhelmingly supported this plan and
the passage of the budget for FY13 will
allow the Framingham Public Schools to
move ahead and continue to improve
student achievement for all students.
SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM
The Department of Special Education
provides a broad array of services for
students identified with disabilities from
the ages of three through twenty -two. The
referral, evaluation and placement
procedures are governed by state and
federal special education laws and
regulations, namely, The Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (  IDEA).
Framingham Public Schools is committed
to the goal of providing an appropriate
education for students with special needs
in the least restrictive setting.
Education and Libraries 
The following programs and services are
offered by Framingham Public Schools
fromPre -Schoolto High School: Special
Education Resource Rooms /In class
supports are available ineach school. The
Resource Room model provides direct
teaching in both special and general
education classroom settings, through
inclusion, supportive teaching and /or
consultation to the general education
classroom teacher of identified students.
There are forty -nine Substantially Separate
classrooms from Kindergarten through
High School. These students require
comprehensive programming which is
provided outside of the regular education
classroom for more than 60% of the
school day. These classrooms are located
at six Elementary Schools, three Middle
Schools and at the High School. One class
is located at BLOCKS Preschool due to
space constraints at the Elementary
School Building. This number also
includes the New England Center for
Children ( NECC) Partnership Classroom
which provides programming for
Framingham students who would
otherwise be Out of District.
At the BLOCKS Preschool, there are
eleven Substantially Separate classroom
sessions.
All Substantially Separate classes serve the
Special Education needs of students
throughout the District. These students
are also included in General Education
classes and ancillary activities at each
building.
Related services, namely speech /language
therapy, occupational therapy, physical
therapy, adaptive physical education and
services from the teachers of the visually
impaired, orientation &  mobility specialist
and consulting audiologist may be
162

Town of Framingham
included in a  student' s Individualized
Education Plan (IEP) and are provided by
specialized personnel at all schools.
Inclusion programs have been established
using a variety of approaches throughout
the district. Some classes are co- taught,
some classes meet for specific periods,
and some special education teachers are
assigned to a group of classes. In addition,
some teachers who are dually licensed in
Special Education and General Education
have full time responsibility for inclusion
classes at the elementary level.
Framingham is a model for Pre -School
Programs for both children with special
needs and typical children ages three to
five. The placement of children with
special needs in the Pre -School Programs
emphasizes language, communication and
social skills development, and integration
with children without special needs.
Framingham continues to see an increase
in the number of children with autism,
multiple disabilities / medical needs and
developmental delays at the Pre -School
level. At the High School level there is a
significant increase in the number of
students identified with social /emotional
disabilities. The severity of these
disabilities presents challenges to the
school district to develop new and
additional programs in order to support
these students in the public schools.
In conclusion, Framingham has continued
to  implement and provide a
comprehensive continuum of programs,
services, and placement options for
students with disabilities. Framingham is
fortunate to have an active Special
Education Parent Advisory Council
whose role is  to engage parents of
children with disabilities and to advise the
Special Education Department.

BILINGUAL EDUCATION
PROGRAMS
The Department of Bilingual Education
provides support and services to students
in grades K -12 whose primary language is
otherthanEnglish. Thisstudentgroupis
often referred to as English language
learners (ELL) and the primary goal of all
bilingual programming is  to provide
specialized instruction in English language
development to enable ELLs to access the
curriculum and achieve in an English
dominant environment. Bilingual
education is an umbrella term which
encompasses a variety of different types
of program models. In Framingham, such
models range from Sheltered English
Immersion to Two -Way Bilingual
Education, to Transitional Bilingual
Education, and include variations on each
of these programs. In 2012, 17.3% of the
district' s population were actively
monitored or received direct services in
English language development from the
Bilingual Education Department. FPS
offered specific programming and support
for 1075 ELLs at eight different schools:
five elementary schools; Barbieri, Brophy,
Dunning, Potter Road, and Wilson; 2
middle schools, Walsh and Fuller; and at
FHS. 434 ELLs
sufficient English
without direct 
who had
to master
intervention 
acquired
content
were
monitored through the Department and
supported as needed to assure successful
transition.
Due to the dedication of the staff and
success of programming, FPS continues
to be recognized as an educational leader
in bilingual education. Our staff, from
faculty to administration, is solicited for
input across the state and plays an active
role in Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education sponsored initiatives
for ELLs. We have participated in various
163
Page 188
Town of Framingham
workshops and focus groups to lend a
voice to policy matters through the Urban
ELL Director' s Network and have had
staff both present and attend conferences
at Massachusetts Association of Teachers
of Speakers of Other Languages
MATSOL),Massachusetts Association of
Bilingual Educators (MABE) and various
othergroups. TheBilingual Department
also continues to lend its particular
expertise to several committees in the
district reviewing curriculum, assessment,
intervention, literacy, and data relating to
the education of all students in
Framingham.
The town -wide Bilingual Parent Advisory
Council has continued to enjoy active and
robust membership. Over the summer, in
response to the overwhelming interest and
participation of our initial offering, the
Bilingual Department in collaboration
with the Framingham Adult ESL program
sponsored another course in ESL for the
parents ofourstudents. Over 100 parents
participated in four different sections of
beginner and intermediate ESL classes.
Two sections comprised of our parents
continued in the Fall and the Winter terms
respectively of the Adult ESL program.
Having played an active role in the
Superintendent search last year, one of the
first town -wide B -PAC meetings this Fall
had Dr. Scott, Superintendent of Schools
as its invited guest and primary speaker .
The success of the town -wide B -PAC and
the tireless efforts of the co- presidents
reflect the extraordinary commitment of
the Framingham community's parents to
the education of their children.
Education is truly a team effort and it is
with great admiration and appreciation for
the efforts of everyone involved, including
teachers, paraprofessionals, tutors,
parents, students, and administration, that
I  respectfully submit this brief snapshot
on behalf of the Bilingual Education

TITLE I
Title I is a federally funded program that
provides financial resources to districts
and schools with a higher percentage of
students from low- income families. All
four of our Title I  schools, Barbieri,
Brophy, McCarthy and Woodrow Wilson
Elementary Schools, have " school -wide
programs."This means that all students in
the school are eligible to receive support
through the Title I program.
In the Title I  schools, we continue to
provide reading and math interventionists.
Intervention groups and student learning
goals are determined using student data at
school - based, grade -level intervention
meetings. The grade -level intervention
meetings include interventionists,
classroom teachers, and other support
personnel. The meetings are held in the
fall and reviewed in the winter.
In addition to the interventionists, Title I
also continues to provide half -time math
coaches at the Title I schools. The math
coaches work closely with classroom
teachers to support the mathematics
achievement of those students most at
risk of not meeting the state's high
academic standards.
Finally, Title I  is  also continuing to
support data teams during the 2012 -13
school year. Through this initiative,
teachers work in collaborative groups to
review student data and use it to guide
instructional decisions. In order to help
teachers address specific student learning
problems that are identified at the data
team meetings, Title I  provides
supplementary materials such as
professional books for teacher book clubs
164
Page 189
Town of Framingham
and intervention materials. Combined
with Title IIA funds, data teams are well -
established in all elementary and middle
schools.
The Title I program is pleased with the
support it is able to provide to students,
families, and the general school
community.

FRAMINGHAM ADULT ESL P "s
Plus (
Framingham Adult ESL FAESL +)
has a reputation in the field of adult
education for providing high quality
services, and this year we lived up to our
reputation quite well! FAESL+ served
over 700 students each semester in 2012,
offering morning and evening ESL
classes, Citizenship classes, ABE /GED
classes, and volunteer -led preparation
classes. We increased our intensity of
service by adding more contact hours for
our ABE /GED classes, and by adding
additional classes for our ESL students in
Computers, Pronunciation, and Career
Readiness.
Our Students
Our students performed well in 2012.
Although our adult students attend classes
voluntarily and are overcommitted with
work, family and community obligations,
we ask students to sign a contract stating
that they will maintain 80% attendance.
The 2012 program average attendance was
over 84 %,  far exceeding the advanced
DESE Performance Standards for average
attendance in adult education. Adult
learners vote with their feet, and our
student retention shows their satisfaction.
Over the past decade, students have
stayed with the program for an average of
three and a half semesters.
89% of our students completed pre and
post testing, and almost half of our ESOL
Education and Libraries 
2012 Annual Town Report
and ABE learners showed significant gain
on standardized tests and class placement,
placing Framingham Adult ESL Plus in the
top quartile for ABE /ESOL programs in
the state. We helped eight students get
their GED, and we helped nine students
to become US Citizens, with eleven more
completing their citizenship applications.
2012 saw a  continued shift in our
students' diversity. The number of
Portuguese speakers has declined
significantly, and we have been seeing
more Spanish, Arabic, and French Creole
speakers. Additionally, there are many
Asian and African languages that we are
seeing for the first time.
Our Staff
Our staff reflects our respect for our
students. In 2012, seven of our employees
were former students at FAESL +,  and 25
of our staff members were multilingual.
Like other DESE- funded program, most
FAESL teachers are largely part -time
employees. Yet our staff attrition rates are
low, at 10 %.  This continuity of instruction
supports both learners and the program in
general. In order to further nurture our
staff's Professional Development, we hold
Program Capacity Weeks twice a year.
These are in -house conferences designed
to equip our staff to meet the needs of all
stakeholders, from the students to the
State House. Sessions include topics like
differentiated instruction, teaching
pronunciation, integrating technology, and
college and career readiness skills.
In addition to the number of funded slots
for students, the program leverages the
funded infrastructure to recruit, train, and
supervise 23 volunteers. These committed
men and women use FAESL+ curricula
to teach weekly classes for 120 students
on our wait list, while others provide one -
on-one tutoring to students in our regular
classes. 
165
Page 190
Town of Framingham
Our Curricula
Our leadership team and teaching staff
have revised and developed new curricula.
Our ABE Math Curriculum, drawn from
the Massachusetts ABE Math curriculum,
clearly delineates four levels of math, with
gradually increasing difficulty, and
includes a  tailored assessment for
placement. Our higher -level ESOL
instructors have created an ESL Writing
curriculum that ensures a 
seamless
progression of skills across three levels of
ESL Writing. Staff members also revised
our ESL curriculum to infuse College and
Career Readiness skills across all levels of
instruction.
The Counseling staff has been working on
Next Steps Advising Plans, helping
students set and plan for their future
college and careers goals. This anticipated
the DESE's move towards College and
Career Readiness this summer, and today
FAESL+ has done more Education and
Career Plans than any other community
based organization teaching ESOL in this
state.
The program is the lead agency in a
Commonwealth Corporation grant, in
partnership with Mass Bay Community
College and the Metro Southwest
Partnership for a Skilled Workforce. This
grant is designed to help transition adult
learners into college, using a hybrid online
course whose curriculum is contextualized
for health care programs.
Our Thanks
This has been an exciting year for our
program. Our students, staff, curriculum,
and collaborations have made us better
than ever. We would like to thank our
staff, students, and volunteers for our
success and vibrancy. Ongoing support
from the Framingham community
continues to strengthen our commitment

andeffectiveness. Furthermore, we are
sincerely thankful to be part of the
Framingham PublicSchools. Thestable
infrastructure provided by the school
department has allowed Framingham
Adult ESL Pius to grow into one of the
most well- respected adult education
programs in the state.
Technology Department
The Office of Technology (  OT) is
responsible for all  administrative,
instructional, and communications
technology for the Framingham Public
Schools. Sixteen locations are supported
on our private fiber -optic wide area
network (WAN) with over 9,000 users
5,500 network accounts),almost 3,000
computers, and over 1,000 VoIP ( Voice
over Internet Protocol) telephones. The
Office of Technology is  focused on
enhancing and streamlining the teaching
and learning process with an efficient and
accessible network, a robust and Web -
accessible student data management
system, and IP -based and wireless
telecommunications. The Office of
Technology's primary purpose is  to
support teaching and learning in the 21st
Century. To this end, we leverage
technology to improve the efficiency of
teaching and learning as 
well as 
the
efficiency of administration through the
use of  cost saving, innovating
technologies.
Over the last few years, the Office of
Technology used capital funding to
purchase over 700 laptops and
approximately 300 projectors for high,
middle and elementary school teachers
andstaff. OT continues to expand
technology including cloud printing
capabilities and managed wireless network
coverage to 214 wireless access points
throughout thedistrict. Also, OT is
working with Building and Grounds

security system.
In the future, the Office of Technology
plans to continue to acquire new laptops
for high, middle, and elementary school
teachers and staff, upgrade classroom
projectors, and modernize computer labs
at all schools. OT plans to put more
technology in the hands of students,
leveraging technologies such as tablets and
otherdevices. The technology will be
integrated with their curriculum and
learning both in and out of the classroom
OT is focusing on leveraging cloud -based
tools and desktop virtualization to allow
access to  data, documents and
applications on a  24x7 basis from
anywhere, with any device. OT is working
with Educational Operations to make all
content digital to allow students to access
curriculum and assignments online.
Furthermore, OT plans to improve
network infrastructure and increase
internet bandwidth speeds.
To improve operations within the District,
OT is evaluating workflows and processes
across departments to create more
efficiency and reduce duplication of tasks.
This involves mapping and re- engineering
all major processes, and where applicable
automating these processes in order to
maintain optimum performance over the
long -term.

TRANSPORTATION
DEPARTMENT
The Transportation Department provides
a vital service for the Framingham Public
Schools. Over five thousand public
school students utilize bus transportation
on a daily basis. The transportation office
continues to work diligently to ensure our
students with safe and efficient transport.
Massachusetts General Law requires the
School Departments to  provide
transportation to all children outside two
miles of each respective district school in
grades K - 6. To that end, Framingham
provides school transportation to three
hundred students in non -public schools in
Framingham. Due to budget constraints,
the School Department moved to a fee -
based transportation program nine years
ago for those students in grades 7 -  12.
Fees are waived for special circumstances
such as children placed in Framingham
foster care homes, homeless students,
special education students and students on
medical waivers. The district does have
limited seats available for purchase for
students who live within 2 miles for
grades K —12.
The District's Transportation Department
has successfully entered into our second
year of a five year contract with Durham
School Services. The Transportation
Department works closely with the
Framingham Police Department's Safety
Division, the Framingham Fire

Administration
Effective on July 1, 2011, Jonathan Evans
became the new Principal of Keefe
TechnicalSchool. In 2012, Jonathan
Evans started his second year as Principal.
Jonathan replaced Patricia Canali who
retired in June 2011. Jonathan was
promoted from the position of Director
of Student Services. Mr. Evans has been
employed by the School District for 15
years, 8 years as an administrator.
In August of 2012, Superintendent Lynch
made a  decision regarding technology
supportatKeefe Technical School. Due
to technology infrastructure issues, it was
decided that engineering support was
needed to evaluate and correct technology
hardware, software as well as building
wide technologyprocedures. Following
that decision, the technology staff was
reduced to support this contracted
services engineering contribution. These
technology improvements were
accomplished within the parameters of the
budget. The superintendent and his staff
supervised all technology in 2012.
The Superintendent's Evaluation Sub -
Committee considered the process by
which the Committee and the
Superintendent established goals for the
172

Town of Framingham
administration against which the
Superintendent's performance is evaluated
periodically by the Committee. The
Superintendent and the Committee will
use the new Educator Evaluation
instrument that is required by the DESE
in 2012 for RTTT participating Districts.
The on -going Sub -Committee members
are John Kahn, William Game, Mike
Rossi, John Evans and Dr. Stephen Kane,
Chair.
The School Committee adopted goals for
the  Superintendent's performance
evaluation period from July 2012 through
June 30, 2013. The goals adopted related
to the following: Improvementofthe
District's administrative meeting
organization, establishment of job
descriptions for all employment positions,
incorporate 21s` century skills into
curriculum, assessment and instruction,
budget development and financial
management, collective bargaining,
recruiting and enrollment, supporting the
school and district improvement plan, and
capital budget planning.
The Committee completed its periodic
evaluation of the Superintendent's
accomplishments against established goals
and desired personalqualities. The
complete record of that evaluation is a
public document that is available at the
South Middlesex Regional School District
Superintendent's office.
The Committee approved a new contract
with the Superintendent extending his
employment through June 30, 2015. The
Superintendent received a  2% salary
increase in 2012.
School Improvement Plans
The Committee adopted The School
Improvement Plan for the 2012 -2013
school year which embodies specific
performance objectives as 
follows: ( 1)
Education and Libraries 
2012 Annual Town Report

benchmarks, 2) development of
reengagement strategies for potential
dropouts or at risk students, 3) work
collaboratively to reduce behavior that
interferes with student learning,
4) implement formative, summative and
authentic assessments to guide instruction
and
5) the implementation of the Common
Core State Standards.
The Committee reviewed the progress
toward the goals of the 2011 -2012 School
Improvement Plan. The report of
Principal Evans noted tangible specific
improvements in school safety, academic
and CTE program growth, expanded
participation in community initiatives and
the continued improvements in the use of
data.
Discipline
The Committee approved revisions to the
Student Handbook that had previously
been approved by the School Council.
Major changes relate to: changes in the
course credit system for English,
mathematics, science, social studies and
the exploratory component of all CTE
programs; adoption of the Massachusetts
High School Program of Studies
MASSCORE);  elimination of the
portfolio requirement and replacing it
with a 4 year career plan that is facilitated
through guidance; appointment of two
administrators serving as Civil Rights
Coordinators; and, the professional
development provided for school bus
drivers as mandated reports in compliance
with State regulations and District
policies. The School Committee formed a
civil rights review committee with goals to
review all  District policies and

administrative practices regarding student
and staff civil rights. The members of
that sub -committee included Ed Burman,
Yvonne Giargiari, John Evans, and John
Kahn.
Race to the Top Program
In 2009, the Superintendent met with the
leaders of the Keefe Tech Education
Association and the Chairman of the
South Middlesex Regional Vocational
Technical School District School
Committee to form an alliance and apply
for participation in the Race to the Top
Grant Program that was offered in
Massachusetts. The South Middlesex
Regional Vocational Technical School
District qualified for this grant and will
have access to approximately $112,00000.
to be used overa fouryearperiod. This
grant opportunity was designed to achieve
five major objectives as follows: 1)
improve educator effectiveness,
2) improve curriculum and instruction, 3)
help to create school turnaround in
identified low performing schools, 4)
improve college and career readiness, and,
5) to provide educators with real time
actionable data through improved data
systems and infrastructure. The
Superintendent expressed pride that all

implement the stated improvements in a
timely and effective manner. I anticipate
that these changes will be required of all
districts by September of 2013.
Post Graduate Program
The Keefe post -graduate program serves
current or recent (1 to 2 year) high school
graduates from member towns.

proposals, grant fund accounting, grant
management, student cafeteria
management, student nutrition, budget
preparation and management, continuing
education registration and inventory
control are all components of the business
office operations that have undergone
significant changes and efficiencies.
Following a business office staff member
retirement, the Superintendent and
Business Manager took the opportunity to
establish a new, much needed position of
AccountingSpecialist. This position
answers directly to the Business Manager,
requires municipal accounting skills and
experience and is considered a specialized
employee who processes confidential
information. The business office has been
reorganized as a  result of this new
position and the structure has improved
performance and efficiency.
State Aid
The Governor and Legislature again
proposed reductions in state aid to
transportation ( approximately 50% of
needed revenue). These funds provide
access to regional schools where
transportation networks extend across
community lines. Moreover, cuts made
after member communities have approved
balanced regional school budgets based
upon reliable forecasts may require
significant reductions in  educational
programs. The Superintendent and the
Committee Chair, with the support of the
Committee, addressed their concerns to
the Governor and State legislators and to
the Massachusetts Association of School
Committees. The Chapter 70 State
funding for the South Middlesex Regional
District has seen slight improvements and
is in proportion to the increases state
wide.

Personnel Administration
The Committee continued to wrestle with
the issue of maintaining an appropriate
health insurance program in the face of
rising costs. The Employee Health
Insurance Advisory Committee (IAC) met
and, at the urging ofthe Superintendent
and Business Manager, recommended that
the District employees open up existing
collective bargaining agreements for
impact bargaining" on existing language
that limited marketplace competition for
health insurance carriers. The three
employee unions and the District
representatives met and agreed on new
language that allowed for competition.
The language was ratified and as a result
of the subsequent competition, health
insurance premiums were reduced by 3%
from 2011 rates and 18% from the
original estimates received prior to
competition. The health insurance
carriers changed from Blue Cross to
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The dental
carrier changed from Blue Cross to
Guardian Dental.

Enrollment, Recruiting and Student
Retention
The Keefe Regional Technical School is a
school of application. Maintaininga
healthy enrollment of students for our day
school operation is  essential for our
financial support and overall operational
success. Ourenrollmenthas improvedin
the last two years and we are expecting
further improvements this year. The
Superintendent has indicated that he
believes that the quality and rigor of our
school programs and the safety and
culture of our school environment will
dictate our success in attracting students
and their families to Keefe Technical
School. The Superintendent has
emphasized that the administration,
faculty and support staff must work
together to ensure that Keefe is
recognized by our community as a career
and technical school ofhigh quality. We
have improved and will continue to
improve our marketing techniques, our
communication with our school district
sending town middle and high schools,
and with our connection to prospective
students and their families. The
enrollment on October 1 of 2012 was 713
students reflecting an increase of 35
students fromthe previous year. The
student enrollment is over 700 students
for the first time in 8 years.
It is the Superintendent' s plan to expand
our career and technical program
offerings from a present level of 14 to our
original level of 17 over the next 3 to 5
years. This proposed expansion willtake
careful planning and collaboration with
our District School Committee. As a
result of our re- organization of the
delivery of education programs that
occurred in the 2010 -11 school year, our
facility is positioned to absorb the planned
growth. Itis the Superintendent's intent
that our new CTE offerings satisfy the
work force needs of the greater

Buildings and Grounds
The Keefe Regional Technical School
opened its doors in September of 1973.
As we begin our 39` year of operation,
the Superintendent reported that our
facility is  doing well. Thanks to a
comprehensive energy upgrade that was
completed in 2008, our facility is poised to
move forward without the necessity for
major structural improvements. Our
maintenance and custodial staffs continue
to take ownership for the quality of our
building and grounds. We recently
completed having a contractor perform
improvements to our 100 foot smoke
stack that will improve the structural
integrity of the smoke stack and the
functioning efficiency ofourboilers. We
anticipate that future projects for our
District facility will involve a new roof
membrane, parking lot improvements,
sealing our concrete building envelope,
and athletic locker room renovations.
The superintendent also anticipates
investigating in the installation of photo
voltaic solar panels on our roof after the
installation of a new roof membrane is
completed. Tobegintheprocessof
capital improvements, the Committee
authorized the Superintendent to file a
Statement of  Interest with the
Massachusetts School Building Authority
MSBA).The Statement of Interest filed
with MSBA was not accepted in 2012.
MSBA officials have encouraged the
Superintendent to file a new application in
2013 for a "roof only" project.

failing decreased by 6 %.  This fall, Keefe
Tech was informed that according to the 5
level scaling systems created by the DESE
under the accountability and assistance
levels; Keefe has been categorized as a
level 3  school. Schools with an
accountability status of level 3 will analyze
disaggregated data for all student groups
to ensure interventions and supports are
appropriately aligned to address needs;
review the performance of students with
disabilities and consider improvement or
capacity building activities, as appropriate.
In March, J.P. Keefe hosted the
Massachusetts SkillsUSA with 640 student
participants. KeefeRegionalTechnical
School received 8 Gold medals, 6 Silver
medals, and 6  Bronze medals. In
addition, one Keefe Regional Technical
School SkillsUSA State Officer Candidate
was nominated. Of the eight district gold
medalists, 3 individuals achieved a gold
medal at the state competition and they
subsequently moved on to compete at the
national SkillsUSA competition held in
Kansas City in June. In Kansas City,
Keefe was successful in the national
competition by attaining one Bronze
medal in Welding Sculpture from a

Kelley inJune. Jeanne served the FPL in
various capacities for over 17 years
including time as the Co- coordinator of
the Literacy Unlimited Program,
Supervisor of the Christa McAuliffe
Branch Library and as Assistant Library
Director. Jeanne brought energy and
enthusiasm to all the things she did at the
Library. She will be remembered for
bringing library services to the under -

services for all patrons, and setting the
example for excellence in customer
service. WewishJeannewell onthenext

Building the New Christa McAuliffe
Library
Having been awarded a $ 4.2 million
provisional library construction grant by
the Massachusetts Board of Library
Commissioners in 2011, the Library's
Building Committee continued to lay the
ground work for a new branch library.
Progress was made to secure a site for the
new building on Water Street adjacent to
theNobscot Shopping Plaza. Thissite
offers the advantages of excellent
visibility; access to public transportation;
proximity to residential neighborhoods,
schools and senior housing facilities.
Additionally, a new and vibrant branch
library will contribute substantially to the
economic vitality of the nearby
commercial district.
The Library was notified in October that
the $4.2 million provisional grant would
be made available to the Town once
Town Meeting votes to appropriate the
178
Page 203

Town's portion of the cost of the project.
We anticipate requesting a vote in spring
2013. Meanwhile, the Framingham Public
Library Foundation continues to work
diligently toward the goal to raise
600,000 towards this project.
Improving Accessibility
Significant progress was made towards re-
building the Lexington Street entrance
when Town Meeting appropriated funds
to replace the non- ADA compliant stairs
and handicapped ramp. Thefirmof
Abacus Architects was engaged to develop
design andconstruction documents. It
was 
hoped that construction would
commence in the summer, 
however
serious safety conditions, resulting from
concrete degradation, developed at the
adjoining parking garage necessitating a
re- evaluation of the timing and scope of
the stairs /ramp project. The Library, with
the support of the Town Manager,
engaged the Desmond Engineering Firm
to determine the extent of the failing
concrete and to develop a recommended
course of action. Ultimately, it was
determined that the cost of rectifying the
concrete degradation could not be
justified given the extent of the existing
damage andtheageofthestructure. The
decision was made to request funding
from Town Meeting to demolish the
parking garage and replace it with an on-
grade surface parking lot. OnOctober
16ffi Town meeting appropriated the
funding. Thegarageisscheduledfor
demolition in  spring of  2013.
Construction of the parking lot will
commence soon thereafter in conjunction
with the stairs and ramp project. We
appreciate the efforts of Building
Committee Chair Sam Klaidman, Library
Trustees, community members, and
members of the Disability Commission
who worked on this project. We are
especially grateful for the leadership Town
Manager Robert Halpin provided in
Education and Libraries 
2012 Annual Town Report
regards to determining the best course of
actionregardingthe parkinggarage. The
tremendous assistance of Town Capital
Projects Manager Doug Goddard with the
combining of the projects is  also
noteworthy.
Technology Improvements
The Library improved its technology
services to the public in  several
dimensions. Kiosks were added tothe
Main Library's entrance level, to help
patrons access the Internet without
needing to visit other floors in the Library.
A BookScan station was installed in the
Reference Department, which has proven
to be a tremendously popular way for
patrons to digitize documents. The
Children' s Department added several
sophisticated touchscreen PCs loaded
with educational games. And the Library
began a major project to upgrade older
public Internet and Catalog PCs with
much faster systems.
The Library also began placing RFID tags
in new materials. Down the road, RFID
offers the promise of tremendous
customer service, inventory management,
and staff efficiency benefits.
Reaching out to the Community
The Library collaborated with many
organizations responding to community
needs and providing a wide variety of
educational and enriching programs. This
year, 8789 people attended 244 Library
sponsored adult programs at the Main
Library, an increase of 2360 people over
theprevious year. Highlights oftheyear
included the growing community
participation in our two Lifelong Learning
Programs that are collaborations with
Framingham State University. Our
Lifelong Learning Lecture Series
presented 20 lectures by scholars at the
University as well as other colleges and
universities in the area. Lectures on a
variety of topics were given on Thursday

Page 204
Town of Framingham
evenings at the Library and attendance
increased dramatically over the previous
year. These daytime classes for seniors,
held on Tuesday in March and October
were so popular that we had to limit
registration. More than 200 seniors
participated in each of the October and
March programs. Support forthis project
was generously provided in part by the
MetroWest Health Foundation. The
Danforth Museum, the Boys and Girls
Club, and the Callahan Senior Center
collaborated on thisprogram. Extensive
planning is  underway for the third
Framingham Reads Together program
which, in Spring 2013, will feature
NathanielPhilbrich's "IntheHeartofthe
Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship
Essex ".  The Framingham Reads
Together Committee, spearheaded by
Library Trustee Chair, Elizabeth Fideler,
has worked for two years to develop this
exciting program and related special
events to Framingham. TheLibrary's
adult programming was diverse and
attracted large audiences. Our goal is to
provide a  variety of cultural and
informational programs that educate,
entertainandenrich our audiences. FPL
is  one of the only libraries in the
Commonwealth to offer Friday evening
programming. OurFridayNightFilm
Series regularly attracts large and
enthusiastic crowds. Our Sunday Concert
Series and Summer Concert Series provide
a variety of classical and popular music
with emerging artists that often attracts
capacity crowds. Our weekday evening
events have included programs on a great
variety of subjects including photography
workshops, Art History, Opera, The
Music of the Beatles, Adult Storytelling,
Poetry workshops, Author visits,
Documentary films, and job search
support groups. At the request of many
participants this year, we started a new
Tuesday afternoon Movie Matinee and a
new Writing workshop program. We

363,687 from free cash. The requested
projects included the following
departments: Building Services /Capital
Projects, Library, Parks &  Recreation,
Fire, Police, Public Works, Highway,
Sanitation, Schools and Tech Services.
In addition the CBC recommended to
Town Meeting Enterprise Funds projects
totaling $13,578. 536, The projects were
as 
follows: Water Enterprise Fund
7,799991, and Sewer Enterprise Fund
5,779. 544, The sources of funding were
mostly from bonding with a  total of
1,078119, from retained earnings. A
substantial portion of the bonding
projects will be at interest rates of 2% or
less. In addition, the Town is hopeful that
some stimulus funding will be received
from the Federal Government.
It was a very challenging year for the

July 26, 2012 marked the 22 d 
Anniversary
of the passage of the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA),a Federal Civil
Rights Law.
This past year the Disability Commission
was proud to celebrate its 10th
Anniversary. Aspartofthiscelebration
we met with the Board of Selectmen in
October to  recognize this
accomplishment. We also honored a
former Commissioner, Sara Ludwig.
Sara was a tireless and true advocate for
all people withDisabilities. As a Town
Meeting Member, Sara was instrumental
in having the town install an elevator in
the Memorial Building, allowing all
residents to  participate in  Town
Government. The elevator was recently
updated and the Commission presented a
plaque that reads This elevator is dedicated to
the memory of Sara Luda ig for her manyyears
of advocacy on behalf of Framingham residents
with Disabilities.
Commissioners served on the Libary
Accessibility Building Committee to assist
in the design development of two new
accessible entrances.
In October, the Disability Commission

Commission members met with Robert
Halpin, Town Manager regarding the
ADA Transition Plan Sub -Committee to
ensure that the Town continues to
implement changes outlined in the 2005
ADA Self -Evaluation and Transition Plan.
The Commision expended funds from the
HP Fine Account for many worthwhile
projects and programs:
3,000 toward the new accessible
family restroom at the Library.
1,050 for the Piers Park Adaptive
Adult Sailing program 
for 30
adults to participate in the Sunset

5,625 for the Piers Park Adaptive
Youth Sailing program, which
taught 15 Framingham children
with Disabilities how to sail.
8,000 for the design of a new
accessible entrance design at the
Calahan Senior Center.
We look forward to working closely with
all Town departments, BoS and TMM to
ensure that Framingham is in compliance 
2012 Annual Town Report
with State and Federal access regulations.

Edgell Grove Cemetery
Edgell Grove had a very successful year.
Sales increased in our mausoleum and in
ground lots. We  continued
implementation of our long range plan
which included landscaping our baby lot
and planting the "Cherry Orchard" on the
exit road. We had 61 full burials, 31
cremation burials and 50 in ground grave
sales, some sales being multiple lots. In
the mausoleum there were 5 cremains and
2 crypt internments and 5 crypt and 6
niche sales. Since the work on the chapel
has been completed with a heating system
and air circulation system installed there is
much interest in using it for services. This
year four families had their services there.
We encourage everyone to take a look at
this beautiful building. A mapping plan
has been instituted to bring our maps up
to date and this will be an ongoing project
associated with our long range plan so
that information will be more readily
available for our families.

Finance Committee
The Finance Committee is comprised of
nine members appointed by the Town
Moderator for a term ofthree years. It
recommends action to Town Meeting
regarding the budget and other areas of
finance. Other key responsibilities include
authorizing disbursements from the
Reserve Fund for emergency expenses,
authorizing deficit spending for
emergency winter - related expenses,
approving the expenditure ceiling for
General Committees  184

Town of Framingham
revolving funds and monitoring the
Town's annual audit.
The workload for the Finance Committee
requires a commitment of significant time
from the volunteers who serve on it. In
FY 2012, the Committee met 37 times,
and participated in the Annual Town
Meeting and three Special Town Meetings.
Members often have significant
responsibilities beyond regular Finance
Committee meetings. The Committee
provides representatives to the Real
Property and Capital Budget committees
under Town bylaws. The Committee
routinely appoints liaisons to Keefe Tech
and the School Department to monitor
their independent budget development
processes. Further, the Committee's three -
member Audit Subcommittee meets with
the Town's outside audit firm and the
Chief Financial Officer' s staff to resolve
audit findings. In 2012, the Finance
Committee had representatives on the
Maynard Building Lease /Purchase
Negotiating Group and the Assessment
Review Oversight Committee.
This year was characterized by significant
fiscal challenges. Revenue growth was
disrupted due to ongoing unpredictability
in state and federal government revenue
sources, and continuing decline in local
receipts, and new growth in property
taxes. While significantconcessionswere
made on health care for employees, and
for some collective bargaining units, large
expenses such as special education out -of-
district tuition and certain collective
bargaining agreements continue to grow
faster than revenue. Concern over
property reassessment escalated to public
debate and hearings that resulted in
community pressure to reduce property
taxes for FY 13 and to evaluate the
assessment process. 
2012 Annual Town Report
The Finance Committee continued to
emphasize the need for the Town to break
the cycle of living beyond its means and to
plan for long -term financial stability. The
Committee recommended that the Town:
Adopt a  one percent growth
factor in taxation rather than 2.5
or 1.5 for FY13;
Cease using non -recurring revenue
sources to support recurring
expenses;
Ensure that salaries and benefits
do not grow faster than projected
revenue; expand employee
healthcare cost sharing;
Project 10 -year special education
growth cost and options to reduce
impact on general education;
Gradually fund OPEB liabilities
through the trust fund created by
Town Meeting;
Continue to build the stabilization
fund to close the gap with the
Town's policy goal;
Seek outside consultation to
evaluate the Town process of
property assessment;
Create a comprehensive 10 year
maintenance and capital plan for
all town owned buildings;
Maximize operational efficiencies
between town and school;
Create Internal Control policies
and procedures for all town
departments; and,
Differentiate

The Finance Committee' s budget
recommendations targeted immediate
fiscal realities. In FY 2012, School
Department budget difficulties were

Government Study Committee
The Government Study Committee had
an excellent year. We met nine times with
active participation and lively, productive
discussion.
Working with the Ways and Means
Committee and town counsel we
completed work on major updates to the
Personnel Bylaw. This completed a multi-
year effort and was passed at the Annual
Town Meeting. The revised bylaw is now
in accord with provisions of the Town
Manager Act and the present
responsibilities of the Personnel Manager. 
Our second major focus in 2012 has been
the crafting of a  proposed Bylaw on
Excessive Consumption of Town
Services. When enacted, this will give the
Framingham Police and other town
service providers an additional tool to deal
with problem properties and their owners
in the town's efforts to improve the
quality of life in our neighborhoods. It is
planned to submit the bylaw for
consideration at the 2013 Annual Town
Meeting.
The GSC also submitted and had
approved a warrant article with regard to
the Town Clerk's authority to update
tables of information in Articled I and X
ofthe General Bylaws. Thiswillallowthe
information in those sections of the Bylaw
to be kept current without specific
approval required for  changed
information.
Representatives of the GSC met with
selectmen and other town officials on
several occasions in pursuit of clarification
of the policy regarding authority to
approve out of town sewer and water
connections. The resulting policy was
approved and accepted by the Board of
selectmen early in 2013.
The committee had several discussions
regarding possible voting irregularities due
to the introduction of electronic voting
devices at town meeting. Itwasagreed
that no action was required.
The GSC met with proponents of the
Green Communities Act and agreed to
fully support their efforts to have
Framingham accept and implement the
provisions of this act.
Finally, we as a  committee want to
remember and thank Moderator Ed
Noonan for his support and cooperation

Human Relations Commission
Since its inception in  1970, the

constraints, as well as the implementation
of new agencies within the community,
the Commission lost its office in the
Memorial Building as well as our
Administrative Assistant who could
handle the day to day complaints, and
provide valuable information for the
citizenry. Though the By -laws have not
been changed, the focus of the
Commission has changed over the recent
years.
We have provided educational forums on
relevant issues of concern for our
community. Wehaveprovidedguest
speakers on a variety of topics which have
arisen during the course of the year.
Commissioners have attended Downtown
Renaissance meetings, and supported the
Welcoming Framingham initiative which
took place in the fall. We are also
connected to the Massachusetts Human
Rights (Relations) Commission.
The Commission continues to look for
new members and the public is invited to

each month. Our agenda, which may 
include guest speakers, is placed with the

Town Moderator
The Interim Town Moderator is making
this report as the result of the sudden
passing of our Moderator, Ed Noonan, in
June of 2012, about 1  month after the
completion of the one special town
meeting in March and the Annual Town
Meeting's 13sessions. TheModerator
report will cover my time as temporary
and then Interim Town Moderator which
have been my positions since September.
At the beginning of the 2- article Special
Town Meeting on September 10, the
Town Clerk asked for a  moment of
silence for Mr. Noonan and then asked
for nominations and votes for a
Temporary Town Moderator. I  was
elected by my then fellow Town Meeting
members to serve as 
Temporary
Moderator for the evening. At that
meeting, Town Meeting also passed a
resolution requesting that the Board of
Selectmen appoint me as Interim Town
Moderator, an office I now hold until the
election in April of 2013.
The Moderator serves two key roles in the
town. The first role is to preside over
the Town Meetings. TownMeeting
could have elected a moderator as- needed
to run each session of Town Meeting.
However, the second role cannot be
carried out unless the moderator is either
elected by the town citizens as is normal
or officially appointed as 
Interim
Moderator by the Board of Selectmen.
In regard to the first role, the Moderator
presided over 4 sessions of the 20- Article
Fall Town Meeting which began on 
October 16. After a " Remembrance" for
Ed Noonan, Town Meeting convened and
heard reports and approved budget items,
unpaid bills, transfer of handicap fines to
Disability Commission, collective
Bargaining agreements, salary schedules
for some non -union personnel,
demolition of the Lexington Street Garage
and construction of surface parking there,
technology education and equipment for
Framingham's residents, budget
adjustments, a by -law limiting speakers at
Town Meeting to 5  minutes, a  bylaw
regarding registration and maintenance of
foreclosed properties, a  request to
Legislature to impose municipal liens on
those who have not paid fines and a new
cluster Development bylaw.
In addition, Town Meeting passed a
resolutions requesting town meeting to
ensure that any financial article that results
in the addition of personnel to the Town
roster must allocate a  portion of any
additional voted funds to cover the added
costs of personnel benefits such as health
insurance to the Town.
The second role of the Moderator is to
make appointments (  and
reappointments) to six very important
moderator- appointed" committees, the
Finance Committee, Capital Budget
Committee, Real Property Committee,
Personnel Board, Government Study
Committee and Technical Advisory
Committee. Itisforthissecondrolethat
Town Meeting and the Board of
Selectmen felt it critical that an Interim
Town Moderator be appointed. Eleven
Town Meeting  190
Page 215
Town of Framingham
new appointments and 8 reappointments
have been made so far. All moderator -
appointed committees are full at this time
with the exception of the Government
Study Committee.
A major milestone this year in Town
Meeting has been electronic voting,
implemented at the 2012 Annual Town
Meeting. Overall, the electronic voting
was successful and well accepted by Town
Meeting. Thanks to the Standing
Committee on Rules (especially to Chair
Joel Winett) and the Technology Advisory
Committee for working on this project.
It has been a pleasure to work with the
chairs of the moderator -appointed
committees, as well as our new Town
Manager, Town Clerk and Town Counsel
and their staffs and associates. The
production of the warrant books,
background material and printed motions
were clear and well organized and deserve
special commendation. Thanks also go to
the Board of Selectmen, CFO, Building
Services, and Media Services all ofwhom
are indispensable in the Town Meeting
production.
Special thanks extended to Town Meeting
Members and those who work so
diligently on all the various committees!!I
encourage moderator -appointed
committees to work in partnership with
Town Meeting and Town Manager. I also
encourage those committees to be
proactive regarding issues that affect the
town. The Town ofFramingham may be
at a cross roads and it is incumbent that
we all work together for the common
good of our community and town.
I am very grateful to all those who have
supported me, expressed such confidence
in me and encouraged me in this role of
Moderator.

During the latter part of 2012, the SCPW
held meetings to discuss the Eastleigh
water billing issue, which was eventually
resolved by an agreement with the Board
of Selectmen waived all past water usage
in exchange for Eastleigh installing a well
and disconnecting from town water by
November 1s`
The SCPW also met to discuss out -of-
town sewer accounts and hookups, mainly
with Ashland. The Department of Public
Works provided historical documentation
on the agreements. The SCPW was
satisfied that the DPW had not been
allowing any additional hookups except
those already authorized by an earlier
agreement. The DPW made clear that
they opposed these arrangements, as they
created billing enforcement issues.
During the spring of 2012, members of
the SCPW became concerned about
conditions at the Danforth Green (PUD)
property, and how they might affect the
Birch Road wells project. The SCPW
charged the Vice -Chair to attend a tour of
the property and report back with any

possible issues that could contaminate
Framingham's future water supply.
During last year's meetings with the

Framingham has not been allocating
enough funds to maintain roadways, and
unless more money is  provided, the
roadways will deteriorate to unacceptable

facilitating TJX's renewed commitment to
remain headquartered in Framingham.
In consideration of an article to create a
legal contingency fund the SCW &M
recommended requirements to increase
the level of transparency. As a result, the
SCW &M, FinCom and the BOS must be
apprised of each $25,000+ expenditure.
Total spending on one case is limited to
100,000 without town meeting approval.
The Interim Town Manager appointed an
Assessment Review Committee (  with
SCW &M representation) to support a
contracted consultant hired to evaluate the
2012 levy abnormality as well as assessing
operations and processes. The SCW &M
will continue to advocate for the changes
recommended by the consultant.
While reviewing proposed compensation
changes, the committee identified stipends
as a red flag and urged the administration
to move away from them. They appear to
facilitate the perception that job training
and changes in responsibilities justify
itemized, incremental compensation.
The SCW &M reignited dormant efforts to
invest in restoration of Athenaeum Hall in
Saxonville with a motion to determine the
work required to obtain an occupancy
permit. A complete report followed and a
strategic plan is in development.
The SCW &M also recommended that the
finance division consider bonding select
water /sewer infrastructure projects for 40
years instead of 20 to take advantage of
low interest and curtail spikes in rates.

DEDICATION
Edward J. Noonan
February 15, 1936 —June 26, 2012
The Town Clerk dedicates Framingham's
2012 Town Meeting Journal in memory of Ed
Noonan.
On June 26, 2012 Framingham Town
Government lost a friend and colleague when
our Moderator, Ed Noonan passed away. Ed
was a devoted family man who had recently
begun enjoying retirement with his lovely wife
Judy. He often spoke about his children and
grandchildren and always looked forward to
visiting them.
Some of Ed's many accomplishments and
contributions to the Town of Framingham
throughout over twenty years of service
Town Meeting 
include but are not limited to: 14 year Town
Meeting Member; Capital Budget Committee
member for 7 years, many as Chair, and
Moderator for 8 years. Ed really loved being
the Framingham Town Moderator. He was a
strong advocate for Town Meeting and
insisted on respect for our legislative branch,
its members and the Moderator. Many ofus
were gently reminded to thank "  the
moderator" when he recognized us to speak.
Ed understood and appreciated the
importance of the Moderator's role in Town
Government and devoted considerable time
and effort to mastering the numerous
parliamentary rules and procedures that guide
town meeting. He also appreciated the
197
Page 222
Town of Framingham
importance of the many committees whose
members he appointed- Finance, Capital
Budget, Government Study, Real Property
and Technology Advisory Committees and
the Personnel Board. Ed based his
appointments on a candidate's qualifications.
He monitored the performance of his
appointees and based reappointments on their
performance and commitment.
Ed was a vibrant, caring person who was
admired and respected by all of us with whom
he interacted in town administration and in
the community. He understood and
appreciated the responsibilities of the
administration and of our elected officials and
our elected and appointed boards. He worked
with us to ensure that Town Meeting would
operate smoothly and efficiently. He was
always cheerful and respectful. Ed worked
particularly closely with Town Counsel, the
Town Manager, the CFO and the Town Clerk
in a  cooperative and professional manner.
Staff in the Town Manager /Board of
Selectmen' s office and the Town Clerk's
office enjoyed Ed's  visits and the
thoughtfulness he showed to each of us. Ed
visited both these offices after town meeting
adjourned to thank us for working with him
throughout the process and as you know he
always adjourned town meeting with a public
thank you to all those involved in the town
meeting process.
Our State Senator Karen Spilka, who attended
Ed's funeral, adjourned the June 29, 2012
session of the MA Senate in memory of Ed.
There was a moment of silence and Karen
read excerpts from his obituary. This is a
permanent record of the State Senate and a
copy on parchment was sent to Judy.
Ed was a  genuine public servant who
generously shared his time, talent and wisdom
for the benefit of Framingham. His impact
was huge. His hard work and commitment
will be greatly missed and always remembered.
Town Meeting 
2012 Annual Town Report

On behalf of a grateful community — thank
you, Mr. Moderator.

Valerie Mulvey, Town Clerk

May 22, 2012 Voted: Whereas there are inequities in assessing practices of residential and commercial
properties,
Whereas Chapter 3 ofthe Acts of2004 SECTION 2 (a) directed the department ofrevenue, to determine
sustainable and equitable methods for addressing the current and any future divergence in residential and
commercial and industrial property values and that no action has been taken to address this issue,
Whereas on December 2004, the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, Division of Local Services
provided a Tax Classification Report and this report ended with the following statement: "We also
suggest that consideration be given to using sale prices to value larger CIP properties that may be
acquired on a speculative basis when the income approach significantly undervalues the property" and
that no action has been taken in response to this suggestion.
Therefore, it is the will of Framingham Town Meeting that the Framingham legislators file Special Acts
with the Massachusetts General Court to address the inequities in assessing practices of residential and
commercial properties. These acts should require acceptance by a community with the option to revoke
such acceptance. The Department ofRevenue could allow assessors to:
Consideration A: Tax Rate for Apartments
Tax apartments and residential properties with four (4) or more units at the commercial rate rather than at
the residential rate, to recognize that apartments may be acquired on a speculative basis and are a
business,
Consideration B: Consider Short Sales
Consider short sales when determining the average value in an area,
Consideration C: Consider Sale Price
Consider sales price when determining assessments when it exceeds the assessment using the value
method,
Consideration D: Tax Surcharge
Apply a tax surcharge of up to 10% of the tax for the previous year when a commercial or industrial
organization does not provide the required income form in a timely manner or provides an incomplete
form. The property owner would be notified by registered mail that that the required form was not
received when due and would have 14 days to provide the form before the treasurer would be notified to
send out a surcharge bill.
Consideration E: Limit on Tax Increase
Limit the annual increase in the tax on a property to an increase of 10 percent over the tax for the previous
year provided that no enhancements to the property were made. The tax in excess of 110 percent of the
previous year's tax would be allowed as an abatement. If the total of all abatements exceeds the budget
the excess would be an expense in the following year's budget.

COLAs or step increases or any other type of increase in its budget, the funds must come from the
appropriations that we are voting on today. $96,030.600,00.
Robert Bolles, Precinct 6
May 16, 2012 Voted: Be it resolved that this Town Meeting wishes to express its concern with the long
term potential impacts of stagnating commercial properties and the recent decline in growth in new
commercial development. Historically thriving commercial properties and new commercial development
have been an important source of growth in the tax base upon which the Town could rely for new
revenue, and for which the Town is dependent to endure the continuation of all Town services without
shifting the cost of growth to much higher residential taxation or reducing services.
Also, be it resolved that this Town Meeting respectfully requests that the Board of Selectmen and Town
ManagerreviewthestructureandorganizationofallaspectsofEconomicDevelopment. Suchreview
should include an evaluation of the Town's economic development mission, leadership, organization,
priorities, budget, staffing, and administrative lines of reporting in order to re -focus the attention,
priorities and staffing on specific quantitative and qualitative economic development goals and the tasks
required to achieve them, and further, that those goals be measured against results on a quarterly basis to
preserve, protect and expand the continued long term growth of Framingham's tax base.

Permit and defined herein as the NCD tract, such parcel or parcels must have definite
boundaries ascertainable from a recorded deed or recorded plan and be located within a
zone permitting a NCD.
b. The Planning Board may permit lots directly on opposite sides of a street, right -of -way, or
public utility to qualify as a single NCD tract of land. To permit such division of an NCD
tract of land by a street, right -of -way, or public utility, the Planning Board must find that
this would comply with the purpose of this section and not result in any more dwelling
units than would be possible in accordance with the provisions of this By -law ifthe lots on
either side of the street, right -of -way, or public utility were developed separately. Such
permit shall be subject to the Dimensional Regulations and Design Standards under Section
IV.3. R.herein.

requirements of this By -law, and in accordance with the additional requirements and
standards specified within this Section IV.R.,only if no variance has been issued from the
requirements of this Section IV.R. A variance shall render a property ineligible for the
filing of a NCD application and special permit under this section.

installations, ditching, grading or construction of roads, grading of land or lots, or
excavation except for purposes of soil testing, dredging or filling, or construction of
buildings or structures shall be done within 12 months prior to the filing of an NCD
