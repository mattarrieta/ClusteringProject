TOWN OF IFRAmINGHAM
MASSACHUSETTS
IZ
Annual Report
Year Ending December 31, 2009
Framingham's Town Seal: In the year 1900, the Framingham Town Seal was redesigned for the
Town's bicentennial to recognize our community's prominence in education and transportation.
The Framingham State Normal School, a free public school and the first of its kind in America, is
representedby the structure at the top of the design. Governor Danforth, the founder of
Framingham and owner of much of its land, is acknowledged by the words " Danforth's Farms
1662" on the shield at the center. The wheel on the shield with spokes drawn as tracks radiating in
six different directions represents the steam and electric railroads and signifies the Town's position
as a transportation hub. Surrounding the words "Town of Framingham Incorporated 1700" is an
illustrative border of straw braid, which honors the prominent role Framingham played in the
manufacture of hats and bonnets in the 1800s.

Town of Framingham  2009 Annual Report
Calendar year 2009 was both challenging and
productive, with a number of issues of critical
importance facing the Town of Framingham.
The Board met in regular business session on at
least 36 separate occasions throughout the year,
and in addition participated in a large number
of meetings /events related to Town business.
These include Metrowest Growth Management,
Metrowest Regional Transportation Authority,
Metropolitan Area Planning Council, I -495
Partnership, and the Metropolitan Planning
Organization among others. In addition to
completing work on carryover FY09 Goals
during the first portion of calendar year 2009,
the Board embraced the following broad
categories of Goals for FYIO: Commu-
nity /Economic Development; Long -term
Capital Infrastructure Needs; Energy Efficiency
and Environment; and Budget Concerns.
Overlaying all of the Town's basic work in 2009
was the continuing reality of a national eco-
nomic recession, and the resultant loss ofboth
state and local revenues to the Town to support
the staff that delivers our basic services to
residents. Unfortunately, this significant reduc-
tion in revenue required that the Town Manager
reduce Town -side staffing to live within the
realities of the Town's budget. By March of
2009, this had resulted in the reduction of 29
full -time equivalent positions providing basic
services in Town Government. No such
reduction in employees can occur without an
attendant impact on basic customer service; the
Board appreciates the willingness of all remain-
ing Town employees who have stepped up and
taken on additional responsibility to maintain
critical basic services for our residents.
The Town continued to work diligently in
defending Town interests in several fundamen-
tal legal areas. These included the unfortunate,
General Government 
long -running litigation against the Town by the
South Middlesex Opportunity Council. The
Town is now awaiting a judge's preliminary
decision in this case. The Town's position in the
landuse- related Nexum case was affirmed,
followed shortly after by an appeal. With Town
Meeting concurrence, the Board of Selectmen
continue to responsibly manage the Town's
critical interests in these legal areas in close
collaboration with Town Counsel.
The Board of Selectmen, like their counterparts
in municipalities across the Commonwealth,
were frustrated and disappointed with the
significant reductions in local aid to municipali-
ties, further eroding the state -local partnership.
These reductions included not only cuts in
Cherry Sheet payments but also a failure on the
part of the state to meet their ongoing obliga-
tions under the long- standing Quinn Bill
partnership with municipalities. This has
unfairly shifted unnecessary legal costs from the
state to local municipalities at the very time
whenbudgetdollars are mostprecious. Fur-
ther, continuing unfunded State mandates
consume our local resources. Examples ofthis
are the recent state trench regulation law as well
as the new, expansive paperwork requirements
of the state ethics reform bill. On the positive
side, the Legislature supported the Governor's
initiative on the local revenue options regarding
the small, incremental meals and lodging tax
which Town Meeting endorsed. Town Meeting
directed that this new revenue be placed in the
Town Stabilization Fund, with benefits to the
Town's long -term financial stability. The long -
awaited repeal of the state tax loophole for
telecommunications (  poles and wires) was
welcome. We still await action to repeal the
inequitable remaining loophole regarding
Page 13
Town of Framingham
telecommunications equipment; this would
benefit Framingham significantly.
Demand for pro -active police and fire services
continued in neighborhoods throughout the
community. We were all greatly troubled at the
tragic shooting of police officer Phil Hurton
early in 2009. We are most thankful that he has
made a full recovery and has returned to work!
We continue to work closely with the Town
Manager and the Chief of Police in pursuing
enhanced strategies to facilitate the police
department's ability to identify similar potential
public safety threats in a responsible manner.
The Department of Public Works completed its
most aggressive year so far in utility replace-
ment and reconstruction. This is, of course, part
of a multi -year Administrative Consent Order
to which the Town agreed several years ago to
reverse the significant deterioration of the
Town water and sewer infrastructure that was
occurring following years of obsolescence.
These responsibilities are pursuant to the
federal Clean Water Act. Although these Town
utility projects continue to create temporary
traffic flow inconveniences in various parts of
the community, we are finally reinvesting in a
planned, thoughtful manner in critical Town
infrastructure to the benefit of all. We thank all
residents for their continued patience as this
important effort moves forward.
During 2009, the Board took the lead in
collaborating with the Town of Natick in
creating a political support group of 25 local
communities all served by the Metrowest
Medical Center. This, of course, includes both
the Framingham Union and the Leonard Morse
Hospitals so important to the quality of life in
the Metrowest area. This working group of local
communities met on two different occasions to
discuss areas of common concern and with the
common mission of support for the continued
success of the Metrowest Medical Center.
Regularly scheduled meetings will continue into
the future.
A number of long -delayed Town building
improvements began. The replacement and
General Government 
2009 Annual Report
reconstruction of the long- damaged front steps
of the Memorial Building was completed with
aesthetically pleasing results; our "front door"
entrance to the world has now been largely
restored as a visual anchor in Framingham's
downtown. Long- awaited improvements to
restore the integrity of the exterior of the
Maynard Building were initiated late in 2009,
with work continuing into 2010. The Bowditch
Field reconstruction project continued
throughout 2009, laying the foundation for an
extraordinary new and renovated recreation
facility to be completed within the coming year
to enhance the quality of life for all in the
community. In addition, 2009 saw further
expansion and improvements at the Callahan
Senior Center as well as the latest phased
improvement of Cushing Park.
Work continued in 2009 on the strategically
important downtown railroad grade separation
and streetscape initiative. This continued to
build on efforts over the past several years. A
set of preliminary conceptual studies was
completed. We greatly appreciate the assistance
of our legislators and Congressman in working
with the Town to maintain critical funding for
the continuing engineering and design work.
This is a  monumental effort that has the
potential to transform the downtown of
Framingham, greatly enhance traffic flows,
improve public safety and raise the bar for the
quality of life in our community for both
businesses and residents. More work lies ahead
and it is imperative that we stay the course on
this important work; our future success as a
community depends on it.
We continue to work in close collaboration with
the Framingham Housing Authority in areas of
common interest. This includes the exciting
redevelopment of the Musterfield Project,
which is now underway. This partnership also
includes the current Town initiative on Housing
Foreclosure Prevention.
Finally, the Board would like to offer a sincere
thank you to the many, many dedicated indi-
viduals who work so diligently to make Fram-
ingham such a rich and wonderful place to live

andwork. From senior Town officials to front
line employees to elected and appointed boards,
committees and commissions, the Town has a
committed and highly professional group of
persons working on its behalf. That is our great
strength. Leaving us in 2009 was Assistant
Town Manager Tim Goddard, whom we thank
for his dedicated professional service. Also
leaving us, as of this writing, is Executive
Assistant Scott Morelli whom we thank for his 
2009 Annual Report
exemplary professional work. We also welcome
new Assistant Town Manager David Williams,
hired as Mr. Goddard's successor by Town
Manager Julian Suso. In closing, we look
forward to continued progress on the afore-
mentioned issues and others in 2010.
Respectfully Submitted,
A. Ginger Esty, Chair, Board of Selectmen
I am pleased to present this Town Manager's
Report for Framingham for calendar year 2009.
It includes a brief summary of selected activities
and is not intended to be comprehensive of all
Town affairs. This more comprehensive
information is included elsewhere in this
Annual Town Report. Given the financial
situation we are facing as a community, I have
determined to focus my report accordingly.
As we concluded 2008 and turned the page into
2009, the Town as well as all local and state
governments continued to be profoundly
affected by the continuing national economic
downturn. This began the second consecutive
year in which Town government operated in a
reduced spending mode. The freeze on hiring
for non -essential staff positions within the
Town and the companion cautious spending on
all operating elements, begun in the fourth
quarter of calendar year 2008, continued
throughout 2009. Further, the Town's 2009
actual revenues began to fall short of initial
estimates, significantly fueled by the state's
unilateral reduction in local aid to Framingham
and other local governments. Fortunately, the
School Department was able to avoid signifi-
cant reductions /cutbacks in revenue in 2009
due to a one -time -only infusion of targeted
federal economic stimulus funds to education in
excess of $2.5 million; this one -time supplemen-
tary federal operating subsidy was essentially
unavailable to municipalities in 2009. During
2009 we reduced Town staff positions by 29
full -time equivalents through both attrition and
General Government 
furloughs. This was a combination of reduc-
tions in both full -time and part -time Town staff
positions. All Town divisions supported by
general fund spending were affected. This,
unfortunately, culminated in the layoffs and
reductions -in -hours of ten Town employees to
supplement those positions already vacated
through attrition. This was the responsible
management action necessary for the Town to
live within our means. A number of Town
employees, including management and supervi-
sory personnel, have stepped up during this
time to assume additional duties and responsi-
bilities to help ensure that quality customer
service is maintained in spite of this significant
loss of staff support. As Town Manager, I thank
my colleagues for their leadership, dedication
and professionalism in this challenging time. As
2009 drew to a close, the careful scrutiny of
Town spending continued, with all signs
confirming that a national economic recovery
lies in the more "distant" future.
On January 24, 2009, new Fire Chief Gary
Daugherty officially began his duties. Gary was
selected following a rigorous search, including a
formal assessment center process. Gary has
been a welcome addition to our professional
management team. In October, Assistant Town
Manager Tim Goddard left Town employment
to accept the position of Town Manager in
Carlisle. I  thank Tim for the high level of
professionalism and expertise he brought to this
position during his three years as my colleague.
In late December, Iwas pleased to confirm the 
3

Town of Framingham  2009 Annual Report
appointment of David Williams to succeed Tim.
David was scheduled to begin his duties with
the Town on February 1, 2010.
We were the recipients of both good news and
bad news from the state level in 2009. While we
suffered the significant reduction in local
financial aid already noted and rallied to re-
spond to unfunded state mandates regarding
trench regulation and the significant paperwork
required for a state change in ethics laws, we
were pleased to secure some measure of further
local revenue autonomy. This included the
state's closing of the telecommunications tax
loophole for poles and wires as well as provid-
ing the authorization for municipalities to levy a
very modest local meals and lodging tax. Town
Meeting, in its wisdom, acted to make Framing-
ham one of the first municipalities in the state
to ratify these modest local user taxes. Many
other municipalities have followed Framing -
ham's lead. The meals tax increment, for
instance, amounts only to an additional 75 cents
on a $100 restaurant bill. As Town Manager, I
have called this modest local meals and lodging
tax a form of "user fee,"as it begins to account
for the considerable services that we as a Town
provide to the many visitors to our community
who receive Town services while enjoying visits
to our many local establishments. These
services vary from police and fire /rescue
response as needed, to traffic -related services
provided by the Department of Public Works.
Regarding state taxation, we join with munici-
palities throughout the Commonwealth in
continuing to urge our legislators to step up and
repeal the significant remaining state tax
loophole which represents the telecommunica-
tions tax on equipment —this would be of
considerable benefit to the Town as well, and at
a very urgent time.
I want to present a few additional comments
about the state reduction in local aid. The
Town, of course, experienced a reduction in the
state's local aid to municipalities of about 9.7%
on the Town's Cherry Sheet. In addition, and
less well publicized, the Town's pilot payment
for being the " host community" for MCI- 
Framingham was totally eliminated (a loss of
75,437 from the past year).Further devastating
to the Town was the state's refusal to fund their
full share of responsibility for the Quinn Bill
compensating police officers for their educa-
tional attainment. In doing this, the state placed
Framingham and many other municipalities in a
very difficult financial and legal position as to
the responsibility for thisan amount that
equals over $450,000 in Framingham alone.
This placed the Town in an adversarial position
with its police officers, an unconscionable
situation that could have and should have been
anticipated and avoided by the state. We simply
do not have the financial resources to absorb
this additional payment annually without
concessions or assistance. Ironically, the Quinn
Bill has now become yet another form of state
unfunded mandate at the very time when local
municipalities can least afford it. Substantial
legal resources are being expended as of this
writing in protecting the Town's position,
which should not need to occur. Although the
state has acted to amend existing Quinn Bill
language in state law, they inexplicably did not
address a companion issue that some police
unions are pursuing in an attempt to penalize
municipalities by levying "triple damages" for
alleged non -payment of wages. As of this
writing, we continue to work with the very
limited options available to us to unravel this
situation, which has unilaterally been laid at our
feet.
In closing, I  am grateful to the Board of
Selectmen for their leadership and support
during 2009. I  commend the division and
department heads comprising Framingham' s
excellent administrative team for their extraor-
dinary commitment and collaborative spirit
during this year just completed. I also thank
Town Meeting for your communication,
engagement and budget support for the many
Town services we are privileged to deliver to
fellow residents of Framingham.
Respectfully submitted,
Julian M Suso, Town Manager

The Framingham Town Clerk's office is the
largest joint clerk /election operation in Massa-
chusetts. We are also one ofthe busiest clerk's
offices in the state. The presence of a birthing
hospital, numerous nursing homes and assisted
living facilities and a population of over 66,000
residents contribute to the substantial work
load.
The Town Clerk Division is responsible for
creating and preserving all the Town's vital
records. Assistant Town Clerk Lisa Ferguson
manages our daily operations. Lisa trains and
supervises staff and attends conferences and
workshops to ensure that we comply with all
state requirements.
Administrators Emily Black and Lauren
DiGiandomenico process vital records. They
registered and issued 1525 birth certificates, 584
death certificates, 495 marriage licenses, 3354
dog licenses and 602 business certificates in
2009. Other administrative responsibilities
include: collecting fines for the Board of
Health, Conservation Commission, Building
and Public Works departments and Animal
Control; filing Zoning Board of Appeals,
Planning Board and Historic Commission
decisions; conducting genealogy searches and
posting meetings and meeting minutes. Our
2009 revenues were $228,413.
The Election Division is  responsible for
conducting the Annual Town Census and all
elections. Town Meeting original documents
and votes are filed in our office. We prepare the
Attorney General Bylaw submissions and post
the bylaws when they are approved.
In 2009, Election Coordinator Chris Sullivan
registered 1484 people, deleted 1121 voters and
amended 6466 records. The Annual Town
Election had an historically low turnout of
3.4 %. A special state primary to fill the US
Senate seat vacated by the death of Senator 
Edward M. Kennedy was held on December 8"'.
The turnout was 23 %.
The Annual Town Meeting met over thirteen
nights in April and May. Members voted on 48
articles and approved six resolutions. Two
Special Town Meetings were held in 2009. Two
articles were voted at the April 30 meeting and
members voted on 34 articles, and approved
two resolutions over four nights at the October
27 meeting.
In July, the state legislature passed legislation
that imposes additional work on city and town
clerks with additional costs to municipalities,
often referred to as unfunded mandates.
Changes to the Conflict of Interest Law became
effective on September 29. Clerks were notified
of their new responsibilities on September 23.
Changes to Campaign Finance laws and the
Open Meeting Law will take effect in 2010.
In response to the additional workload in this
office caused by the two special elections and
the implementation of the new Conflict of
Interest Law, Town Manager Julian Suso asked
Alexis Silver, Human Services Coordinator and
Alison Steinfeld, Community &  Economic
Development Director to coordinate the
Complete Count Committee of the US Census
with State Representative Pam Richardson. As
the selectmen- appointed liaison to the US
Census, I am very grateful to him for recogniz-
ing and responding to this need and to Alexis
and Alison for their dedication and tireless
efforts to help us achieve an accurate count of
our residents. In addition, DPW Director Peter
Sellers and Town Engineer Jeremy Marsette
generously allowed their GIS expert, Geoff
Kovar, to review the US Census officials'
response to our Local Update of Census
Addresses (LUCA).Geoff was able to identify
491 addresses that the federal counters had
missed. This could translate to an additional
736,500.

Many people have contributed to our success.
The Board of Selectmen, Town Officials and
Town Meeting members provide consistent
support to this office; it is a genuine pleasure to
work with them and with all those who partici-
pate in our government. Town employees are
always professional, knowledgeable and willing
to help. We are especially grateful to Jim Egan
and the Building Services staff for facilitating
elections. We are not charged to use Keefe
Tech or St. Tarcisius Parish Center as polling
locations; nor are we charged to park in St.
Stephen's lot on election days. Our pollworkers
continue to work long days to ensure that the
public is well served when they vote. Through 
2009 Annual Report
the Senior Tax Relief Program, we were fortu-
nate to have the help of Chet Fenno, Gertrude
Kaplan and Alexandra Ross.
Finally and most importantly I  thank and
commend my small, dedicated staff for their
hard work, professionalism and knowledgeable,
friendly attitudes when dealing with the public.
They exemplify the Town's commitment to
excellent customer service.

Valerie Mulvey, Town Clerk

Bugaboo moved for a temporary restraining order or, in the alternative, a preliminary
injunction prohibiting the Town from requiring the removal of Bugaboo's advertising
panels. After a hearing and review of the parties' memoranda of law and affidavits, the
Superior Court denied Bugaboo's motion for a temporary restraining order and
preliminary injunction. The parties moved, respectively, for summary judgment on
January 26, 2009. While these motions were pending, the parties resolved the matter
and filed a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice on August 21, 2009.
This action was filed against the Town in 2005 by approximately 100 Framingham
patrol officers alleging that the Town failed to appropriately compute and pay overtime
wages as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA),29 U. S.C. § §201 -219. The
Town contends that it complied with the FLSA pursuant to payments made to the
officers under the terms ofthe parties' collective bargaining agreement. An important
issue in this case is the proper work period to be used in calculating required overtime
sums. The Town contends that at all relevant times it had an established 24 -day work
period whereby the officers were entitled to FLSA overtime only for time worked in
excess of 147 hours over a 24 -day work period, in accordance with a formula set forth
underapplicablefederalRegulations. Theofficershavearguedthattheoperative
threshold should be 40 hours within a given week, such that they would be entitled to
overtime pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 each week. The Town moved for
summary judgment on this key issue early in 2008. On July 2, 2008, the Court issued a
written decision which sided with the Town and found that the Town had effectively
established a 24 -day work period under the FLSA in 1986. Following the Court's
decision, the parties entered a stipulation of j udgment whereby the Town would not be
liable to the officers, subject to the officers' right to appeal the Court's determination
that the Town established a 24 -day work period under 29 U. S.C. §207(k) to the United
States CourtofAppeals fortheFirstCircuit. Aftertheparties filedtheirrespective
appeal briefs in the fall of 2009, the First Circuit held an oral argument in this case on
February 4, 2010. The Court took the matter under advisement and as of the date of
this report has not issued a decision.
This matter involves the Conservation Commission's efforts to enforce wetlands
violations committed by William Carney of32ParkerRoad. The Commission found
that Mr. Carney had clear cut numerous trees and dumped brush within a wetlands
resource area located on 28 Parker Road, 30 Parker Road, and 32 Parker Road. The
Commission issued an enforcement order on April 2, 2008 and an amended enforce-
ment order on June 4, 2008. Mr. Carney appealed the enforcement order(s) to the
Superior Court under the certiorari statute, G.L. c. 249, § 4. In response, the Town
moved to dismiss Mr. Carney's complaint and filed a counterclaim seeking an order
requiring Mr. Carney's compliance with the Enforcement Order. The Court granted the
Town's motion to dismiss onMay 4, 2009. The Townis currently preparing amotion
for summa as to its counterclaim.
The plaintiffs, Cheryl B. Cramer and Carol L. Bosworth, appealed a special permit
granted by the Planning Board to Staples, Inc. for land clearing under Section IV.4H.of
theZoningBylaw. Stapleswasgrantedthespecialpermitforlandlocatedat225
Crossing Boulevard in Framingham in order to remove trees and clear a portion of the
property for snow storage. The parties filed a stipulation of dismissal in May, 2009.
This case is now closed.
The Framingham Police Officers Union (FPOU) filed this unfair labor practice charge
with the Massachusetts Labor Relations Commission, now the Division ofLabor
Resources (DLR),following the Town's issuance of correspondence to the FPOU in
April of 2007 reaffirming the existence ofthe Town's 24 -day work period pursuant to
29 USC 207(k) ofthe FairLabor Standards Act. The Townprepared aresponsive
submission and moved to stay this matter pending the outcome of the Calvao v.
Framingham FLSA federal court litigation in which the Court has determined the
effectiveness of the Town's establishment of the 24 -day work period. On April 30,
2009, after administratively closing the matter in November, 2007, the Division of
Labor Relations issued acomplaintofunfairpractice againstthe Town. The Town
filed a motion to dismiss the charge on May 12, 2009. The DLR has taken no action on

class- action appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in
Calvao, et al. v. Town of Framingham, Appeal No. 09 -1648 (described above).
In 2007 Patrolman Eduardo Rivera filed a demand for arbitration appealing a discipli-
nary suspension. TheTownfiledanactioninMiddlesex Superior Courttoenjointhe
arbitration on the grounds that the CBA expressly provides that the proper forum to
appeal disciplinary decisions is the Civil Service Commission rather than arbitration.
After the Superior Court granted the Town's motion for a preliminary injunction to
enjoin the arbitration, the FPOU filed a motion for summary judgment on August 18,
2009. The Townopposed this motion andaccompanied its opposition withits own
cross -motion for summary judgment. On February 5, 2010, the Superior Court issued
an order denying the FPOU's motion for summary judgment and allowing the Town's
cross -motion. TheFPOUhas30daystofile anoticeofappeal. Thearbitration
proceeding has been stayedpending the final outcome ofthe Superior Court case. The
plaintiff has filed a notice of appeal of this decision with the Superior Court.
The Framingham Police Officers Union filed this complaint of prohibited management
practice charge on June 26, 2009, alleging that the Town committed an unfair manage -
ment practice by allegedly requiring certain patrol officers to be interviewed without
representation in connection with an internal affairs investigation concerning a different
officer. The Division ofLabor Relations issued acomplaint ofprohibited practice on
January 8, 2010, to which the Town filed an answer on January 19, 2010. The Town
expects the DLR to hold a hearing on this complaint in the fall of 2010.
This matter involved a Bid Protest Regarding East Framingham Sewer Improvement
Project, A Street Wastewater Management Facility. General Mechanical Contractors,
Inc. filed a bid protest on December 15, 2009 with the Bid Unit of the Attorney
General's Office regarding the HVAC sub -bids for the A Street Wastewater Manage-
ment Facility. General Mechanical was the fourth -lowest filed sub -bidder for the
HVACwork. GeneralMechanicalclaimedthattheTownshouldhaverequiredall
HVAC sub -bidders to list on the Form for Sub -Bids certain categories of sub -sub -bids
whose costs were estimated to exceed the statutory threshold of $10,000, and that the
failure to sorequire was astatutory defectinthe bidding process. Due tothe bid
protest, the Town rejected all HVAC sub -bids and solicited new bids for the HVAC
work. General Mechanical withdrew its protest on December 23, 2009.
ess Corporation filed an appeal in February of 2009 of a decision by the Zoning
Board of Appeals denying it a special permit modification for its gas station located at
272 Hollis Street. After engaging in initial discovery, the ZBA moved for summary
judgment on the grounds that the doctrine of res judicata precluded the plaintiff from
seeking zoning reliefthat was denied in 2005. The Land Court issued anorder denying
the motion on October 1, 2009. Following the Court's decision, the ZBA retained an
expert traffic consultant. The case is scheduled for trial on June 23, 2010 at the Land
Court in Boston.
This action involved the appeal of a special permit issued by the Zoning Board of
Appeals on July 22, 2008 allowing Ms. Roberta Baskum to operate a kennel upon
property located at 5 Irene Road. Various abutters have appealed this decision to the
Land Court. The plaintiff withdrew this action on April 6, 2009. This case is now
closed.
This case involves the appeal of a December, 2008 Enforcement Order issued

position. Members oftheunion didnotapply totakethe examination anditwas

In response to the events leading up to the cancellation of the exam, the Town filed
an unfair labor practice charge with the DLR alleging that the union unlawfully
threatened union members with sanctions, including expulsion from the union, if
anymemberstookthe examination. Theparties agreedto settlethismatter inthe
spring of2009. This matterisnowclosed.
In December of 2005, the Zoning Board denied applicant's request for a special permit
or a determination that the proposed use, a concrete batching plant, was apermitted use
in the zoning district. That month, a Special Town Meeting also approved amendments
to the Zoning By -law which changed the zoning designation of the area to Office
Professional, such that the proposed use became prohibited and could not be authorized
even through a special permit. Paulini filed two subsequent lawsuits in the Land Court.
The first lawsuit was an appeal seeking to overturn the ZBA's denial of the special
permit and to obtain a declaration from the Court that the proposed project did not
require aspecialpermit. The secondlawsuitwas achallenge tothevalidity ofthe
bylawamendments. ThelitigationwasstayedbytheLandCourtasPaulinifiledan
application for abuilding permit in 2008 for a similaruse atthe Property. The Building
Commissioner denied the application on the grounds that the proposed use requires a
special permit in the applicable zoning district and the proposed project requires a
dimensional variance since the plans showed that a structure would be constructed
within arequired setback area. Paulini appealed the BuildingInspector's denialwith
the ZBA. After a duly noticed public hearing, the ZBA voted unanimously to deny the
appeal anduphold the Building Commissioner's decision. Paulinifiled an appeal ofthe
Board ofAppeals' decision with the Land Court. The ZBA moved for summary
judgmentinthesummer of2009. TheCourthasnotyetissuedadecision onthe
Town's motion. As the ZBA's motion remains pending, the ZBA is reviewing another
application by Paulini for a special permit to conduct a similar use at the Property.
This lawsuit was filed in 2006 by Public Works Supply, Inc. ("PWS "), a supplier of fire
hydrants, after the Town awarded a contract for fire hydrants to one of PWS's competi-
tors. The Court issued a decision denying PW S' motion for a preliminary injunction.
The Town filed a counterclaim for interference with its contractual relationship with the
successful bidder. The parties reached a settlement and filed a stipulation ofdismissal
on July 24, 2009 withdrawing their respective claims with prejudice. This case is now
closed.
The plaintiff filed this case in September of 2007, alleging breach of contract and
seeking payment for work purportedly performed by Revoli in connection with the
Doeskin Pump Station and WaterLineproject. Theplaintiffalleges specifically that
the Town failed to make payment in the amount of $48,16286.for loaming and seeding
work. The Townhasfiledacounterclaim seeking recovery ofcertaincosts and
additional expenses that it incurred due to alleged defects in Revoli's performance.
Discovery has closed and the parties are awaiting the Court's scheduling of a trial.
This matter involved as series of bid protests that were withdrawn in connection with
the Bowditch Athletic Complex Renovation project (`Project The first protest was
filed by Sagamore seeking to challenge whether the bid of Emond Plumbing & Heating
Emond "), the lowest plumbing filed sub -bidder, should be disqualified for neglecting
to include a signed certificate or attestation of tax compliance with their bid package
and for neglecting to submit a separate non -collusion affidavit with its bid package. The
second protest was by Emond seeking to withdraw its sub -bid or a return ofits bid bond
as a result of what it characterized as a "bona fide clerical error of a substantial nature."
The third protest was brought by Seaver Construction, Inc. (` Seaver "),the General
Contractor for the Project, seeking an adjustment of the price of its contract with the
Town as aresult ofthe withdrawal ofEmond. Eachofthese protests was withdrawn
following the Town's filing of its oppositions. These matters are now closed.

In 1999, the Conservation Commission denied an order of conditions for a wetlands
crossing to access aparcel of land and construct a subdivision ofbetween 40 -45 homes.
Winch Pond Trust appealed the decision under the bylaw to Superior Court and under
the Wetlands Protection Act to the DEP and obtained a Superceding Order of Condi-
tions from the DEP, which the Town appealed. In 2004, the Town opposed the Trust's
motion to substitute a revised plan in the DEP proceeding showing certain changes to
thewetlands crossingplan showntothe Conservation Commission in 1999. After
hearing oral argument, the Administrative Law Judge ruled that the Trust must either
proceed under the original plan or file a new notice of intent with the Conservation
Commission. TheTrustfiledanewnoticeofintentwiththeConservation Commission
in February of 2005. After several hearings, the new notice of intent was approved by
theConCom withextensive conditions inAugustof2006. The ConCom's Order of

Conte, and the plaintiff and the defendants filed cross -motions for judgment on the

ing order of conditions. After briefing and oral argument, the Superior Court issued a
Memorandum and Order denying plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings, and

Appeals' grant of a comprehensive permit under G.L. c. 40B to Chrysler Apartments,
LLC, in connection with the proposed development of over 400 dwelling units at 5
Chrysler Road inNatick. The Town asserted that theNatick ZBA failed to consider the
Town's input as required under the Golden Triangle Regulations, which require a
reciprocal review agreement between the towns. The Town further alleged thatthe
proposed project would have deleterious impacts upon the Town, its property and its
resources, including with respect to traffic, environmental conditions, and the Town's
emergency services, among other things. The defendant developer moved to dismiss
the complaint based on the allegation that the Town is not an aggrieved party within the
meaning of G.L. c. 40B and thus lacks standing. The Court allowed the developer's
motion on May 27, 2009. Following the Court's order, the parties entered a settlement

The Town's insurer, MIIA, accepted the tender of these cases and initially agreed to

and Popeo P.C. to represent it in this matter. The Town and various individual
defendants movedto dismissvarious counts ofthe complaintin2008. OnSeptem-

other things) it specifically dismissed plaintiffs' claim that the defendants had
engaged in a conspiracy to violate the plaintiffs' civil rights, and the civil rights of
their employees and clients. On March 2, 2009, all defendants moved for summary

This is an action against the Town by a state prison inmate alleging, among other
things, unlawful arrest, conspiracy and assault and battery. The Federal District Court
of Massachusetts dismissed the case with prejudice in September, 2008. The Court's
Memorandum and Order of dismissal noted that Mr. Tang filed twenty -six cases with
the Federal District Court over the past year, 15 of which had already been dismissed as
frivolous or for failure to pay the filing fee, among other things. The plaintiff appealed
the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in October,
2008, and then again in January, 2009. The First Circuit issued rulings in March, 2009
affirming the District Court rulings and dismissing Mr. Tang's appeals. The Court
followed with an Order on April 23, 2009 directing the Clerk of Court not to accept any
further filings by Mr. Tang in this case. Recently, Mr. Tang filed two other lawsuits
against the Town in Middlesex Superior Court.
III. Budgetary Overview
As in past years, I would like to conclude this
report with a brief discussion of budgeting and
legal expenses. In 2009 this office continued its
positive track record of procuring new revenue
for the General Fund or helping to avoid the
imposition of additional costs to the Town.
The services provided by the Office of the
Town Counsel have resulted in monetary
benefits to the Town that has resulted in direct 
revenue, mitigation and avoided expenses three
to four times greater than the Town's FY 2009
appropriation of $623,000.
Below is a chart summarizing the revenue,
mitigation and avoided expenses achieved in FY
2009 and likely to be achieved in FY 2010 by
the efforts of the Office of the Town Counsel,
or through the substantial assistance of this
office.

By virtue of a prior year's favorable summary judgment ruling achieved in the Pelham
litigation, the Town was able to cease trash collection at the 550 units at the Pelham
Apartments, which results in avoided expenses estimated at more than $100,000 per year.
By virtue of the Pelham ruling, the Town also was able to cease trash collection at approxi-
mately 1,000 units owned by the Framingham Housing Authority, thus realizing savings of
approximately an additional estimated $ 200,000 per year. These savings amount to
approximately $300,000 per year on an annual recurring basis.
As a result of the District Court's decision allowing the Town's Motion for
Summary Judgment with respect to the Town's establishment of a 24 -day work
period under 29 U.C. S.207(k),the Town has avoided liability to date for ap-
proximately $1,000500,in damages, inview of the stringent federal lawthat often
allows for double damages and attorney's fees to be assessed against parties found
to have violated the Fair Labor Standards Act. Additionally, the Town has to date
avoided the need to pay FLSA overtime to officers who work more than 40 hours
per week (CBA overtime is paid),thus saving the Town approximately $150,000
per year on an annual basis.

Anne Wynne, Payroll Administrator, maintains
and processes the Town's weekly payroll and
attendance records. 2009 is the last year that
Payroll was a function of Human Resources. It
has been transitioned to the Department of
Accounting.
Cindy McKellick is the Benefits Administrator.
She administers health, dental and life insurance
programs for the Town, the schools, and
retirees.
Claudia Araujo manages the Worker's Compen-
sation program for employees of the Town and
the School Department. She also manages the
Direct Pay Program, performs benefit audits,
provides ongoing assistance in the area of
benefit administration, and processes payroll on
an as- needed basis.
Brant Johnson, the newest addition to the
department, is the Administrative Assistant. He
provides administrative support and manages
monthly departmental vendor meetings, as well
as HR- sponsored events, such as the Employee
Recognition and Health and Wellness Fair.
In the past year, the department has undertaken
a classification and compensation study to
compare Framingham with similar communi-
ties. That study will be finalized mid -year 2010.
The department continues to organize free
seminars to introduce employees to existing and
expanded "voluntary" benefits provided by the
Town, such as long -term care insurance,
Flexible Spending Accounts, and supplemental
life insurance. The Town does not pay any
funds for these benefits, but offers employees
group rates and other advantages.
Due to fiscal constraints, this year will be
extremely challenging, but the department is
determined to continue serving the Town's
employees, retirees, and citizensin a courte-
ous and professional manner.
Personnel Board
The Personnel Board serves in an advisory
capacity to the Town Manager and Human
Resources Director, who has jurisdiction over
personnel functions. This 5- member board is

The Department of Veterans' Services was
established pursuant to Chapter 115 of the
Massachusetts General Laws. The Mission of
the department is to aid, assist, advise and
advocate for veterans and their dependents
regarding their right to benefits and services
under local, state and federal laws. Services
offered by the department include emergency
financial assistance; help with obtaining food,
clothing and shelter; assistance in filling out
claim forms for benefits; as well as coordinating
other social services and resources that might
be available to aid veterans and their depend-
ents. The department keeps up to date on new
policies, legislation and programs available to
the veteran community.
In an attempt to reach the new generation of
returning veterans, we have started a Face -
book page. Please come visit.

Veterans' activities this year included Memorial
Day Ceremonies, during which the Veterans
Council placed 4,100 flags on the graves of
veterans in Framingham cemeteries. The
traditional Veterans Day activities were con-
ducted in the beautiful Cushing Chapel, due to
construction at the Memorial Building.
In addition to these activities, The director
participated in the Welch School's Veterans
Activities. Veterans are treated to a  short
program by the students, followed by a question
and answer period. This is by far the favorite
veteran event in town. Calls from veterans
begin in June wondering when the November

dates are going to be set. A Trench Art exhibit
was held at the Framingham Historical Society,
in conjunction with a "Thank you" party for the
Edgell Library receiving enough votes to win a
100,000 grant for new windows.
The federal government distributes $5.6 million
dollars annually to Framingham veterans and
their dependents for compensation and /or
pensions. Veterans' Services continues to help
veterans apply for these funds. If you served in
Vietnam, recent changes in diseases associated
with Agent Orange exposure may make it worth
your while to come in and see the VSO. 
2009 Annual Report
The Framingham Veterans Council with
President Larry Herson and his fellow council
members distributed 80 fruit baskets to Middle-

VA hospitals and 2,200 knitted helmet "liners"
for the troops in Afghanistan. These are all
distributed or shipped out through the efforts
of the Veterans Council.

both School and Town. There are a total of 325
users ofthe Munis system: 184 Town and 141
School users.
In 2009, Direct Pay retirees were loaded into
the Munis General billing system to allow
receivables and payables to be tracked on our

The Manager of Database Services assumed
responsibility for Public Safety administration,
including off -hours support to Police and Fire,
after the mid -year departure of the previous
administrator. Updates were completed in2009
for Keystone Computer Aided Dispatching for
both Fire and Police, Identix Finger Print and
Palm Scanning, FireHouse Incident Reporting
software, and the new Fire Mobile wireless
response and reporting system, as well as
operating system and office automation soft-
ware upgrades for various PC's and laptops.
The dispatch server for Fire operated the entire
year without shutdown and with less than 2
hours of online maintenance. The Police server
had some unscheduled shutdowns during
testing and implementation of the new Com-
puter Aided Dispatching software but otherwise
ran continuously 24 hours a day. Day -to -day
support for dispatch operations has shifted
from Tech Service to Public Safety. Due to our

Alexis J. Silver, LICSW, Human Service
Policy and Program Coordinator
Building Services is a department of the Gen-
eral Government Division. Our primary
function is the care and maintenance of Town
buildings under the jurisdiction of the Town
Manager.
A serious reduction in force has reduced our
staff, and this mandated the department to
prioritize our work. We continue to make
strides in using volunteer and subsidized help
from non -Town agencies in these times of
budget cuts. Building Services has been in-
volved with many routine repair projects and
preventive programs this past year.
Our capital projects program has been trans-
ferred to Doug Goddard, Capital Projects
Manager, who has taken an aggressive approach
to many needed repair and replacement projects
funded by Town Meeting. We thank Doug for
his professionalism.
In addition to our core responsibilities Building
Services operates all parking functions, the 
Parking Meter program, Waverly Commuter
Lot, Pearl Street Garage and the Hollis Court
Lot.
Staffing issues continue to be particularly
difficult as the Town struggles through another
year of budget cuts. I, as always would like to
sincerely thank and acknowledge my staff, who
continue to adjust under less than perfect
circumstances.
Building Services will continue in the coming
year to provide services to the best of its
abilities. I also would like to thank the many
departments of the Town for their assistance
throughout the year. I  look forward to the
coming year with the challenges the Town faces
and the commitment to the Town philosophy,
Dedicated to Excellence in Public Service."

December 1, 2009, marked the end of my first
year of service as the Capital Building Projects
Manager fortheTown ofFramingham. During
the past year, I have been able to access and
review the existing conditions of many of the
town- owned properties, and determine where
the financial and technical challenges exist,
moving forward.
I  have developed working relationships with
town departments, residents, boards and
committees, and state legislators. These rela-
tionships help to expedite building projects, and
improve our building infrastructure in Fram-
ingham.

As the Capital Building Projects Manager, my
duties include working with the Town Manager
to envision and expedite strategic building
projects. In the past year, I  have managed
financial, technical, and historical aspects of
building projects that have a value of over
20,000.000,00 in Framingham. Included are
many projects in multiple buildings, of widely
varying ages and complexities. These projects
are: Edgell Memorial Library, Memorial Build-
ing, Maynard Building, Callahan Senior Center,
Police Department Headquarters, Fire Depart-
ment Headquarters, Fire Stations, and Library
Buildings.

The position of Capital Building Projects
Manager has allowed me to be an energy
advocate on behalf of Framingham to decrease
the energy consumption of town owned
buildings. This serves two purposes: saving the
Framingham taxpayers money and reducing the
carbon footprint" of Framingham. This part of
my position has been interesting to me, since
energy- saving technology has always been one
of my keen interests. This part of my job has
drawn the attention of state officials and
afforded the Town of Framingham the oppor-
tunity to take advantage of federal stimulus
funding. This will both create good jobs in
Framingham and will bolster our economic
stability.

The desire of the historical preserva-

Town of Framingham  2009 Annual Report
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer has
both financial and policy duties. It is staffed by
the Chief Financial Officer and an Assistant
Chief Financial Officer. The Office oversees
Town financial managementwith the assistance
of three departments that have direct responsi-
bility for financial management of Town
government: the Assessing Department is
responsible for the administration of the
property tax system including the valuation of
real and personal property and the assessment
of taxes against these parcels and accounts. The
Office ofthe Treasurer /Collector is responsible
for the collection of all town revenues, the
investment ofall revenues, and the management
of the Town's debt. The Accounting Depart-
ment maintains the Town's accounting records,
generates financial management information for
use by all Town departments in the manage-
ment of their operations, directs all audit
activity and reviews compliance with internal
controls.
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer is
directly responsible for the development of the
annual operating and capital budgets. The CFO
works closely with all Town officials to develop
these budgets. Upon adoption of the annual
operating and capital budgets, the Office of the
Chief Financial Officer monitors revenue and
spending throughout the year to eliminate
budgetary problems that adversely affect the
fiscal condition of the Town. The CFO is also
required to file a long -term forecast for strategic
plan of the Towns financial position.
Other responsibilities of the Chief Financial
Officer include participation in management of
workers' compensation claims, management of
the health insurance plan and membership on
the Retirement Board.
Finance 
Maintaining the financial health of the Town
was a critical task in 2009. State aid for FYI 0,
which began July 1, 2009, was reduced by more
than $3.4 million. In total, revenue grew by less
than 1 %,  even though property taxes were
increased by the maximum 2.5 %. Municipal
departments were reduced in total by 3.1% and
the School Department increased a total of $1.5
million only because of federal stimulus money.
Health insurance increased by its lowest annual
rate in recent times, 5.2 %, but it still grew to
more than 15% of the total budget. The shift of
costs to Medicare, which began July 1, 2009,
and the increase in employee premium contri-
butions in January 2010 should mitigate the
increase in the cost of health care, but its
growth rate is still unsustainable. The Town
awarded a bid for the bulk purchase of tax liens,
which increased collections $ 1 million. The
Town passed an increase in the local room tax
of 2% and a new local meals tax of .75 %. The
revenue generated by these new taxes was
placed in the Stabilization Fund, the Town's
savings account, as it is severely underfunded.
This had a positive impact on the financial
position of the Town. However, local revenues
will not grow until after the economy has
recovered. Budgets will still need to be reduced.
The CFO would like to thank the Assistant
CFO, Jennifer Pratt; Richard G. Howarth, Jr.,
and his staff in the Accounting Department;
Stephen Price and his staff in the Office of the
Treasurer/ Collector; Dan Dargon and his staff
in the Assessing Office. This dedicated group of
smart, innovative, and hard -working employees
keep the Town from financial chaos.

sible for insuring that all expenditures of the
Town conform to the requirements of Massa-
chusetts General Laws, Town Meeting appro-
priations and grantors, and do not exceed Town

The Office also accounts for all financial
transactions of the Town -  receipts and expen-
ditures — in conformance with generally ac-
cepted accounting principles and the Uniform
Municipal Accounting System promulgated by
the Commonwealth ofMassachusetts' Depart-
mentofRevenue. Itthen makes this account-
ing information available to (1) the Town's
municipal program managers to facilitate their
management of program budgets, (2) independ-
ent auditors who must opine on the financial
condition of the Town, (3) state and federal
agencies for use in generating financial informa-
tion for program and policy development, and,
4) credit rating agencies for their use in assess-
ing the Town's fiscal stability and creditworthi-
ness and Residents.
Significant activities of the Accounting Office
include submission of required financial reports,
reconciliation of revenue and expenditure
accounts, cash, and accounts receivable; and
auditing all accounts payable invoices for
accuracy prior to payment.

function was transferred from Human Re-
sources Director to the Chief Financial Officer.
Those responsibilities now fall under the Town
Accountant's Office.
The June 30, 2009 (FY09) balance sheet was
submitted to the DOR on October 6 2009, for
certification of available funds. On October 21,
2008, the DOR certified the following amounts
as 
available for appropriation: General Fund
Free Cash: $1,820, 765,Sewer Enterprise Fund
Retained Earnings: $2,306, 572, Water Enter- 
prise Fund Retained Earnings $ 1,915.209,
These available funds represent unrestricted
surpluses that are available for appropriation by
Town Meeting. They are generated from
positive operating results in relation to the
budget; that is, they are derived from annual
receipts in excess of budget estimates and
expenditures less than the appropriations by
Town Meeting.

essed over 13,600 purchase orders, reviewed
over 47,250 invoices and issued over 19,740

Town of Framingham  2009 Annual Report
Stephen W. Price, Treasurer Collector
Carolyn R. Lyons, Assistant Treasurer
Edna Bernard, Payroll Coordinator
Dawn Devito, Office Manager 
Collector
Fiscal Year 2009 was a good year in this busy
office. Although budget cuts reduced our
staff from 9 to 8, the Treasurer/ Collector's
Office continues to provide customer service
and essential municipal services. As always, I
am indebted to my staff for the firs -class job
they do on my behalf as well as the Town of
Framingham.
Our operating system on Munis continues to
be updated on a regular basis but we have
become very comfortable with it. We have
continued to enjoy excellent in -house
support with Munis from Scott Jung in the
Technical Services Department and we are
indebted to him. Because of the time -
sensitive nature of most of our operation,
from sending bills to posting payments,
disruptions can be disastrous.
Collection amounts and percentages were as
follows. Real Estate taxes collected were
1 6, 338.722,37 (97.95 %)  and Personal
Property taxes were $7,021.349,03 (98.95 %).
Excise Taxes collected were $5,755.038,27
78.04 %).Excise tax is collected on a calen-
dar -year basis, which is reflected in the lower
collection percentage. Tax Title collections
were $3,642.448,41, including interest and
penalties. We have continued to work hard
on delinquent taxes in every area and recently
conducted a bulk sales auction of delinquent
tax title liens.
Earnings on general fund investments for the
year totaling $354,53579.were below budget.
We continue to monitor the bank rates to
maximize our earnings.
The Town continued to hold the Al bond
ratingwith a Challenging outlook in FY 2010

from Moody's. The future will hold a
challenge to maintain it but the goal is to
work to that end. We need to improve our
fund balances to help offset those areas that
we have little control over, such as per capita
income levels.
We issued two Bond Anticipation Notes in
2009, one in the amount of $2,000545,
awarded to Eastern Bank at a net interest
cost of 0.5980 %,  including a premium of
1,71; 912,.and the other in the amount of
22,076, 276, including a 
premium of
210,31146.to Eastern Bank at a net interest
cost 0.5540 %.  Additionally we borrowed
7,000824, in general obligation bonds for
multiple projects awarded to Fidelity Capital
Markets. At a rate of 3.64% among the
several bidders. The bid included accrued
interest of $2,60, 128. and a premium for
73,47. 019. This was the most competitive
rate in the face of stable Fed Fund rates.
Additionally, the Town refunded
19,00.700,00 in general obligation bonds at
a rate of 2.85% awarded to Bank of America.
Net savings of $318, 665.24 will be recog-
nized over the period of the loan due to
mature on 06/2020.30/
This department has worked diligently to
meet the requirements of the laws, the
challenges of the technology advances, and
the Town's customer service policy.
We treat taxpayers with respect while
accepting their payments, answering their
questions regarding process, and solving
their problems as quickly and efficiently as
possible.

The Board ofAssessors' annual report for
calendar year 2009 with statistics for Fiscal Year
2009 is as follows:
Because of the values established in Fiscal Year
2009, we received 598 abatement applications.
These applications represented 3.39% of the
total tax bills issued for Fiscal Year 2009.
In Fiscal Year 2010 the residential class con-
tributed $45.9 million dollars in new value. This
growth was attributed to new homes completed
in 2009 as well as other improvements made to
the residential inventory during 2009. Commer-
cial & Industrial growth added $16.9 million in
commercial and industrial new growth value
along with $30.6 million in personal property
new growth value.
Values were lowered for Fiscal Year 2010 due
to declining values indicated by sales and
market dataanalyzed. The average value fora
single -family homewas $342,887 from $369,018
or 7.4 %. 
I would like to thank Members of the Board of
Assessors, Mr. Arthur Holmes and Mr. William
Figler, for their dedication and insight in
assessing matters. I would also like to thank
Assessors staff members Cindy Lombardi,
Wendy Elassy, Jim St. Andre, Sharon Gagne,
Paul D'Olympio, Jr. and Kelly Schoor for their
hardwork. Also, I would like to thank Mr.
James Sullivan, Esquire for his legal assistance.
After a presentation to the Board of Selectmen
on December 11, 2009, for the Fiscal year 2010
Tax Rate Classification Hearing, the Board
voted to adopt a 75% shift in values of the
Commercial, Industrial and Personal Property
classes of property to maintain the share of the
tax levy borne by these classes in Fiscal Year
2010. The Fiscal Year tax rates are: Residential -
14.52 and Commercial, Industrial and Personal
Property - $33.65.

A MESSAGE FROM CHIEF CARL
The Framingham Police Department is charged
with protecting and serving those who live,
work and travel in Framingham. The depart-
ment accomplishes its mission by establishing
partnerships with the community, using innova-
tive problem solving approaches, and recogniz-
ing the value of strong leadership and
organizational accountability. In aclimate of
extremely limited financial resources, 
the
department continues to aggressively pursue
grant funding and other non -town revenue
streams to assist in accomplishing its mission.
Financial constraints have forced the depart-
ment to focus on the preservation of core and
essential police services. However, the Fram-
ingham Police Department has not lost sight of
its commitment to the community and will
continue to deliver exceptional service.
The department is pleased to welcome back to
duty Officer Phil Hurton, who sustained serious
and life -threatening gunshot wounds in the
performance of his duties. He was promoted to
the rank of sergeant shortly after returning to
duty.
Also, the department extends its congratula-
tions to Lieutenant Paul J. Shastany, who will
soon be leaving to serve as Chief of Police in
the Town of Stoughton. Paul joins two other
ranking officers who, during my tenure as Chief
of Police, have left Framingham to become
police chiefs in other communities. This shows
that the Framingham Police Department is held
in high regard within the law enforcement
community.
The department will remain proactive and
responsive to the community's needs, even with
limited resources. I am thankful for the strong
Public Safety & Health 
support that the department receives from the
Town Manager, Board of Selectmen, Town
Meeting members, and the community at large.
Retirements
This year we had several retirements of officers
from service. Their long -term dedication to
serving the residents and visitors to Framing-
ham has made this a great community.
Lieutenant Edward Yarosz served the Town
since 1974.
Sgt. Richard Thompson began his career in
1994 and left to become the Chief of Police
for Sherborn Police Department.
Officer Brad Newman began in 1982 and
became the housing liaison officer.
Officer Charles Piso began his career in 1995
and retired due to injuries.
New Police Employees
Our recruitment and hiring of three Portu-
guese- speaking police officers Katharine
Demouraes, Thiago Miranda, and David
Loureiro —are a significant step in bridging the
gap of trust.
Promotions
This year we saw the promotions of three hard
working officers. Those officers are now
Lieutenant Blaise Tersoni and Sergeants Philip
Hurton and Jorge Ruiz.

of licenses and permits, administration fees, and
fines associated with parking tickets and traffic
citations. Money is also received from the
Framingham District Court for fines associated
with penalties imposed upon those convicted of
various crimes. This revenue is not entered into
the Police Department budget, but is deposited
into the Town General Fund. Revenues are as

Emergency Management
Framingham Emergency Management Agency
FrEMA) directs all emergency management
operations in the Town of Framing- 
2009 Annual Report
ham. Emergency management is the prepared-
ness for, mitigation of, response to and
recovery from naturally occurring events like
blizzards, ice storms, hurricanes, flooding or
earthquakes as well as manmade disasters, such
as chemical spills, fires, transportation events
and acts of terrorism. Framingham Emergency
Management has worked extensively under its
current structure to create planning groups,
exercise response activities, secure funding from
grants and state and federal sources and expand
participation in this municipal function.
On September 13, 2009, the local emergency
planning committee assisted the Natick LEPC
with a full -scale exercise at the Natick Collec-
tion; many things were learned and will be
incorporated into our emergency plans in the
future. FrEMA, in conjunction with state and
federal authorities, prepares, administers and
implements Framingham's CEMP (Compre-
hensive Emergency Management Plan) as well
as the federal mandated NIMSCAST. Framing-
ham will continue to be a leader in the ever -
increasing role of emergency management in a
post -911 era; roles and responsibilities are
increasing and the Town will need to recognize
the value of emergency preparedness.
Crime Statistics
The department is committed to using its
resources efficiently and effectively. The use of
crime and statistical analysis enables us to
identify emerging crime trends, track incident
locations and identify and implement preventa-
tive, educational, intervention, or enforcement
strategies.
Due to a federal reporting mandate in 2007,
Domestic Assaults were re -coded and are now
classified from Part 2 offenses to Part 1  of-
fenses under the Assault category. This pro-
duced changes in both Part 1 and 2 offenses in
previous years as well.

AUXILIARY POLICE
The 20 dedicated men and women of the
Framingham Auxiliary Police completed
another outstanding year of service for the
community. For the past 67 years, the auxiliary
police have been an active and vital component
of the Police Department.
The auxiliary police, under the guidance of
Auxiliary Captain Marc Spigel, have a well -
defined training program in which officers

and also assisted in the coordination of the

The Animal Control Officers respond to calls
regarding dogs ( there are more than 3,350
licensed dogs in the Town of Framingham),
cats, livestock and wildlife. 30 different loca-
tions keep livestock and foul. The annual
livestock census is taken by the members of this
department. The department fields many calls
regarding wildlife. The officers offer educational
materials and information from the Massachu-
setts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife.

attend an academy for reserve police officers;
and are trained in first responder first aid and
CPR /AED. Annually the auxiliary officers keep
their skills and certifications current with field
and in- service training. The result is a profes-
sional auxiliary police organization that stands
ready to assist this department.
During the year, the auxiliary officers volunteer
countless hours of their time to help make
Framingham a better place to live and work.
You can see some of their volunteer efforts in
action at community events such as the Con-
certs on the Green, charitable road races, and
child safety programs. As part of the Framing-
ham Emergency Management Agency, auxiliary
police officers provide assistance at the Emer-
gency Operations Center and emergency
shelters as needed, and are trained in the
National Incident Management System.
The Framingham Auxiliary Police were again
honored this year with a Presidential Volunteer
Service Award for their efforts in Framingham.

ADMINISTRATION
The Framingham Fire Department provides
fire, rescue and emergency medical services to
those who live, work and travel through the
community. As the delivery of emergency
services becomes ever more complex, it is
necessary for the fire department to become
more creative in how it delivers these services.
Collaboration and Mutual Aid with other
communities and agencies are now the norm
rather than the exception. We've had some
success in obtaining outside funding through
grant awards from the Executive Office of
Public Safety and Department of Fire Services
and will continue to seek additional outside
revenue sources and grants.
As we continue to face the challenges of a
community as large and complex as Framing-
ham, we would be unable to meet those chal- 
lenges without the quality of the fire personnel
we employ.
In addition to our personnel, we also make use
of new and current technology to meet the
challenges of service delivery. Enhancements to
our communication center started after last
year's Town Meeting. We also upgraded our
portable radio communications so that every
on -duty firefighter is capable ofcommunicating
with the fire dispatcher and \or incident com-
mander. These new portables enhance safety
and allow us to operate more safely and effi-
ciently.
As I begin my second year as Fire Chief, I
would like to thank the Board of Selectmen,
Town Manager, Town Meeting and the resi-
dents themselves for the continued support that
has been given to the Fire Department.

FIRE PREVENTION DIVISION
The Division of Fire Prevention is comprised
of one Fire Marshal, one Assistant Fire Marshal
and two Inspectors. They have the following
responsibilities.
The Fire Marshal is responsible for the day -to-
day operation of the fire prevention office. He
is also responsible for conducting fire investiga-
tions and coordinating activities between the 
Framingham Police Department and the State
Fire Marshal's office. Other responsibilities
include giving safety talks for Framingham's
schools, citizens' groups, and group residences,
and setting up tours of the fire stations. The
marshal also meets on a regular basis with other
town departments to assist in planning the
town's future.
Public Safety & Health  56
Page 68
Town of Framingham  2009 Annual Report
The Assistant Fire Marshal is responsible for
reviewing the construction plans that are
submitted to the Fire Department. He also
meets with contractors regarding fire alarm and
sprinkler systems, as well as conducting meet-
ings with contractors, engineers and property
owners for up- coming projects and any prob-
lems that arise during construction. He coordi-
nates with other town departments on
important issues such as overcrowding, board-
ing and lodging house issues.
The inspectors are responsible for issuing
permits and conducting the inspections required
by state and local codes. They also inspect and
test all new homes and new and remodeled
commercial buildings as well as renovation
projects. The inspectors investigate and work in
conjunction with other town departments to 
handle complaints by citizens and town de-
partments to assure the safety of Framingham' s
residents, their guests, and the ever -increasing
Framingham business community.
The goal of the Framingham Fire Department
is to establish a fire and safety education
program that will be delivered to preschool, day
care, grades K -6, Boy and Girl Scout troops as
well as church and community groups. With
annual visits from the Fire Department, the
safety message will become part of children's
lives, and the children as they grow will always
be aware of fire safety.
A total of $201,20967.was collected in revenue

TRAINING
Training Division objectives are driven by
accepted standards, training mandates, and
operational needs. All training is documented
electronically and quality control reviewed by
the Training Officer. Today's fire service
training needs are diverse and often include
cooperative ventures with other public safety
agencies and neighboring fire departments.
Training programs involving incident com-

Mill Street Fire
mand, technical rescue, water rescue, tactical
medical operations, hazardous materials re-
sponse and fire and rescue operations are
conducted cooperatively with various agencies.
These include the MetroWest Medical Center,
Framingham Police, State Police, Department
of Fire Services, mutual aid fire departments,
and regional response teams such as the Fire
District 14 Technical Rescue Team. Training is
also conducted with support agencies such as 
57
Page 69
Town of Framingham
the water department, public works, board of
health, Autism Alliance, and Red Cross, to
name a few. The Training Division plays the
lead role in the delivery of the mandated
National Incident Management System, offering
training for all public safety and support
agencies involved.
All firefighter /EMT's attend monthly medical
trainings to meet the state recertification
requirements. All official EMT trainings must
be approved by the State Office of Emergency
Medical Services. Major annual topics include
CPR; trauma management; burn; cardiac
emergencies; elderly emergencies; pediatric
emergencies; environmental emergencies;
wounds, bandaging and splinting; and mass
casualty incident management.
Some of the major fire based training programs
conducted in 2009 include hazardous materials
and decontamination operations, emergency
vehicle operations, self -contained breathing
apparatus proficiency, technical rescue opera-
tions, pump operations, and ladder operations.
In addition, major department -wide training
programs focused on critical areas of fire
service operations and overall firefighter
safety. Professional firefighters know that the
job is demanding, with the safety of the public
and of the firefighters depending on profes-
sional training. Firefighter safety is a top priority
and a comprehensive Rapid Intervention Team
RIT) training program was developed.
Fire training programs focus on skills, basic
knowledge, and demonstrated proficiency. All
members of the department completed individ-
ual skill proficiency training modules and
company evolutions. To ensure consistency,
training follows standard operating guidelines.
In summary, the ultimate goal of the training
division is to support effective operations in a
safe and efficient manner. Sound strategies and
tactics and a proactive approach help to ensure
this endeavor.

FIRE ALARM
The Fire Alarm Division is responsible for the
general maintenance of traffic signals, controls,
the municipal fire alarm system, master boxes,
street boxes and underground and aerial cable.
Nine new master boxes were added in 2009. We

the 905 boxes, 548 are master boxes that
protect individual properties, and 357 are street
boxes.
In addition to the regular duties of maintaining
and installing the fire alarm and communication
system, the Fire Alarm Division was also
responsible for maintaining and repairing forty -
two traffic signals, six 4 -way flashing signals,
twenty -eight school zone signals and two
30mph `S' curve signals. The following is a
breakdown of traffic signal repairs.
66 calls for traffic signals not working;
6 calls for signal heads turned;

tenance and investigations.
8 traffic signals knocked down in motor
vehicle accidents: 10 were reported to the
Police Department, 3were hitand run.
132 calls for school zone signals not working
properly that required time adjustments, new
lamps and new clock installations. This also
included time adjustments made at the begin-
ning and the end of the school year.

FY09 Operating Budget (Actual): $ 759,18077.
For 2009 the inspectors, administrators and
Code Enforcement Inspectors within the
Building Department have had a very active
year providing quality customer service and
effective solutions toward resolving citizen
concerns. 
The focus of the department continues to be to
pursue the highest quality of public service by
responding to concerns as they arise, to follow
up on previous concerns, maintain a record of
property activities reviewed by inspectors and
investigators and be responsive to consumer
protection.

Town of Framingham
The department continues to maintain a
recognized professional presence for its staff
forother communities. Aswework toward
hiring the best and most qualified people to
deliver the services expected, other communi-
ties see these qualities and extend opportunities
to staff members to deliver similar services for
their citizens.
In 2009 Local Inspector Steven Bars tendered
his resignation. Steve had been with the office
for five years; at his time of hire he acted as the
sign review officer and zoning review inspector.
As the staffing increased within the division
with the hiring of the Assistant Sign Officer,
Steve served as a Code Enforcement Inspector
responding to complaints involving residential
properties. When the off -hour Code Enforce-
ment Inspectors were hired, Steve continued as
the day Code Enforcement Officer for Multi -
Families, Restaurants, Night Clubs.
With 2 Local Inspector positions being vacant
and the number of projects ongoing through
out town, Mike Tusino, James Paolini, Mark
Hughes and the Commissioner stepped up to
meet the request for these services in addition
to their everyday duties until the positions can
be refilled. In addition we are continuing to
maintain a vacant position within the off -hour
code enforcement.
We believe that the off -hour code enforcement
is still a high priority of service required to
address many of the issues raised by the citizens
within the town. In light of the reduction of
staff we had to adjust how this service was to
continue. The inspector continues to work all
Saturdays and most evenings during the spring,
summer and fall seasons. Due towinterweather
and concern for the safety of the inspector, we
suspended evening hours enforcement where it
was proving to be unproductive.
The building department in conjunction with
the Town Manager, Board of Selectmen and
many other town officials worked to develop
action planning at the beginning of the year
2008) that is proactive and preventive to assist
in dealing with the housing economic crisis
Public Safety & Health 
2009 Annual Report
occurring within the town and across the
nation.
The action plan resulted in the creation of a
database to monitor foreclosed properties. The
purpose of the plan was to identify foreclosed
properties with the intent to reduce the impacts
these properties could have on public safety and
neighboring properties. In 2008 this office
recorded over 200 foreclosed properties
through out the town. The database identified
123 single -family homes, 93 condominiums, 35
two families and 10 three families.
We continue monitoring the foreclosure notices
for 2009 where there were fewer than 100
additional foreclosure actions during this
period. The database identified 35 single
families, 9 two families, 31 condominiums and 1
three family
We further expanded the database to include
assessed value and recent sale activities for each
of these identified properties.
We will continue to monitor the foreclosure
notices for properties within the town for the
near future. We have determined that by being
proactive in this area we are able to deter
blighted property conditions and have the
people who have interest in these properties
maintain them.
The database contains critical information for
ownership, conditions of the property, status,
and use. Properties noted as being un- occupied
are forwarded to the Framingham Police and
Fire Departments, who monitor and report
conditions of change.
Code Enforcement Activities, which includes
the enforcement of the Nuisance, Sign, Zoning,
General By -Laws and other Life Safety Codes
Regulations and Standard for 2009, was also
very active. The reduction in staffing levels did
not translate into a reduction in requests for
service during 2009; delivering these services
was challenging.
The Code Enforcement Housing activity
reports illustrates that the inspectors investi- 
61
Page 73
Town of Framingham
gated over 900 cases of alleged housing issues
including 24 cases for basement apartments, 73
cases of rooming houses and 115 cases of illegal
apartments.
The Nuisance Officer has investigated and
pursued over 500 cases involving Trash &
Debris, Commercial Vehicles, Unregistered
Vehicles and Vehicles Parking within the front
Setback.
The Sign Officer continues to make progress
with property owners and businesses toward
compliance with the Towns' Sign By -Law. Over
119 signs have been removed and /or brought
into compliance. Over 200 notices have been
sent to owners /businesses advising them of
their signs' non -compliance with the Sign By-
Law, including suggested relief needed to
maintain them. The cataloging of the signs on
each building and property through out the
town is continuing, which provides imaging and
permit history.
The economic crisis and inflationary effects on
commodities and goods provided high demand
for consumer protection. Jack Walsh, the
Town's Sealer, and the Assistant Sealer, Ed 
2009 Annual Report
Gentile, provided preventive and reactive
response service to monitor and address
consumer concerns. They investigated multiple
cases involving retail gas pricing, fuel oil
delivery services and retail price fraud.
The building permit activity for 2009 indicates
that over 1900 permits were issued for this
period, a decrease of 400 plus building permits
in comparison to 2008. The office issued
twenty -three new single -family home building
permits, which is about average for the five -year
permit history. The total receipts for 2009 were
up by $300,000 in comparison to the previous
year.
In conclusion, Iextend my deepest appreciation
to the team I have the pleasure of working with
daily. They are tireless in their individual and
combine efforts to provide quality service to the
people and businesses within the community.

In compliance with Section 34, Chapter 98,
General Laws of the Commonwealth, I submit
my annual report of the Department of Weights
and Measures for the year ended December 31,
2009.
The Weights and Measures Department is
required by state statute to inspect all weighing
and measuring devices in the town of Framing-
ham each calendar year. In 2009, the Depart-
ment inspected 1350 weighing and measures
devices, including scanning audits. The depart-
ment collected $42,00811. in inspection and
sealing fees during 2009. This is the most
revenue ever collected by this department. The
department issued 32 civil citations in calendar
year 2009 for the following: short weight,
pricing errors ( scanning),item pricing, no
motor fuel license, no motor oil license, and
missing consumer notice. The total fine amount
was $ 12,00250. for calendar year 2009.The
average non -criminal fine was $382.81 per
violation. The department has one case pending
in Framingham District Court ( criminal) for
overcharging consumers.
The department during 2009 saved consumers
and businesses in Framingham well into the
hundreds of thousands of dollars by conducting
both mandated and spot inspections. This is in
addition to the fees and fines collected for the
town. Errors were found and corrected which
resulted in sufficient savings to consumers. The 
department checked 3 items in local retail
stores to ensure that they scanned correctly.
The department found that 97.39% were priced
correctly, 1.07% were under priced, and 1.54 %
were overpriced. Thiswas an improvement
over the previous year and shows that our
education and inspection program is working.
The department investigated approximately 56
consumer complaints during the year.
The Sealer has been elected to be the Chairman
of the Northeast Weights and Measures Asso-
ciation for the 2009 -2010 year. This national
organization, which is supported by the United
States Department of Commerce through
National Institute of Standards and Technology
NIST),includes the states ofVermont, Maine,
New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts,
Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and
Pennsylvania. The Sealer was also elected as the
Chair of the Legislation Committee for the
Massachusetts Weights and Measures Associa-
tion.
I want to thank Mike Foley, the Director of
Inspectional Services; the town's part -time
Weights and Measures Inspector, Ed Gentili;
and our part -time Administrative Support
Person, Mary Tiziani, for their help and assis-
tance during the past year.

2009 Annual Report of the East Middlesex
Mosquito Control Project
The East Middlesex Mosquito Control Project
conducts a program in Framingham consisting
of mosquito surveillance, larval and adult
mosquito control, ditch maintenance and public
education.
Over 13 inches of rain fell during June and
July, which produced above -average mosquito
populations and contributed towards an
increased risk of EEE. The adult mosquito
surveillance program used traps to collect
mosquitoes from 5 Framingham locations. Data
was compiled from 24 mosquito trap collec-
tions over 6 nights. In August and September, 
67
Page 79
Town of Framingham
selected trap collections from Framingham and
other Project communities were tested for West
Nile Virus and EEE by the Mass. DPH.
The larval mosquito control program relied on
the larvicides Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis
Bti) and methoprene, which are classified by
the EPA as relatively non -toxic. An April
helicopter application of Bti controlled mos-
quito larvae at 34 wetland acres. Field crews
using portable sprayers applied Bti in the spring
and the summer to 33 wetland acres when high
densities of mosquito larvae were found in
stagnant water. Project personnel applied
packets of Altosid (methoprene) to control
Culex mosquito larvae at 5,816 catchbasins in
June. Culex mosquitoes are considered the
primary West Nile Virus vectors.
For adult mosquito control, 8 crews applied
Sumithrin to 4,184 acres at night using truck
mounted aerosol sprayers when survey traps
indicated high populations of mosquitoes.

ENGINEERING AND
TRANSPORTATION DIVISION
The Engineering and Transportation Division is
responsible for the planning, design and
construction of capital roadway and utility
infrastructure projects, maintaining compliance
with various State & Federal programs such as
NPDES Phase II stormwater, managing the
Town's Street Opening Permit and Trench
Opening Permit programs, reviewing develop-
ment and redevelopment plans to ensure
roadway and utility changes conform to the
Town's construction standards, and inspecting
modifications and expansions to the roadway,
water, sewer and stormwater networks. The
Division also provides technical expertise to the
operational divisions of the Public Works
Department, other Town Departments, various
Boards, Committees, and Commissions,
maintains an extensive Geographical Informa-
tion System (GIS) and is the custodian of a
large collection of irreplaceable paper plans and
documents.
A significant portion of the Division's resources
was directed toward the Department' s extensive
capital improvement program. Many of the
projects in this program are mandated under
MADEP Administrative Consent Order
ACO).
The ACO requires the Town to undertake
major sewer construction and rehabilitation
projects over several years with the primary
Public Works 
focus of alleviating reoccurring sanitary sewer
overflows, a violation of State and Federal law.
Failure to comply with the conditions of the
ACO can result in administrative, civil or
criminal action. Continued improvements to the
infrastructure and maintenance management of
the Wastewater System have resulted in signifi-
cant reductions in Sewer System Overflows
SSO's).
During 2009 over forty major capital improve-
ment projects were completed or advanced.
Over forty -four thousand linear feet of water
and wastewater main were replaced or rehabili-
tated. Locations included Water Street, Cove
Avenue, Prospect Street, State Street, and
Worcester Road. Water and stormwater im-
provements were made on Pearl Harbor Road
to support a $25 million dollar redevelopment
project being undertaken by the Framingham
Housing Authority. Four wastewater pump
stations (  Michaud, Cypress, Ransom and
Paramount) and one water booster station
William J. Heights) were also replaced. Other
construction projects included the rehabilitation
of the Goodnow Water Storage Tank, ad-
vancement of the Franklin Street Traffic and
Roadway Improvements, roadway and sidewalk
improvements on Hardy Road, and the re-
placement of sidewalks on Winthrop Street.
The division also coordinated with the State
during the completion of the Route 9 and Main
Street Bridge projects. 
69
Page 81
Town of Framingham
There were over two dozen active design
projects during 2009. Designs for the East
Framingham Sewer Improvement Project, A
Street Wastewater Management Facility, Central
Street Siphon /Sudbury River Interceptor and
Birch Road Water Resource Center were all
accelerated in order to secure federal stimulus
funding through the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (ARRA).Massachusetts Life
Science Center (MLSC) grant funds were also
used to advance several water and wastewater
designs to support the Technology Park.
Financial management of the capital improve-
ment program required tracking ninety -nine
town appropriations totaling in excess of $185
million, nearly $4 million in State Chapter 90
funds, $12.9 million in MLSC grants, and
310,000 in Massachusetts Executive Office of
Transportation grants. The Division was also
responsible for conducting thirty -nine public
bids.
The Department of Public Works Construction
Standards were completely rewritten in 2009.
These were the first revisions since 1987.
The division designed and implemented emer-
gency repairs to Maple Street Culvert over
Baiting Brook. The design of a replacement
structure is underway and will be constructed in
spring 2010.
The division completed a town -wide public
works Stormwater Management Plan. The
division has also completed the first of several
phases ofa town -wide Stormwater MasterPlan.
The division completed system -wide QA -QC
review of wastewater GIS layers and raised
status of those layers to Functionally Complete;
added new traffic and street signs layers to GIS
system and provided mapping and data for the
town -wide parking study.
Despite the sluggish economy, the volume of
2009 permit application approvals and engineer-
ing plan reviews exceeded previous -year levels.
The division permitted and inspected over
534,000 square feet of street openings, the
Public Works 
2009 Annual Report
equivalent of reconstructing over 3 miles of
new roadway.
HIGHWAY MANAGEMENT
PROGRAM
The Highway Division is responsible for the
maintenance and repair of the Town's roadway
and sidewalk infrastructure, including pavement
markings, granite and bituminous curbing,
street and regulatory signage, stormwater
utilities, traffic islands, and street trees.
Stormwater Management
The Stormwater Management System consists
of more than 200 miles of surface and subsur-
face drainage systems, 12,200 catch basin and
manhole structures, and more than 600 drainage
outfalls. 2009 construction projects included
stormwater pipe and catch basin installation at
the Framingham Housing Authority property
on Pearl Harbor Drive. This work was per-
formed by the department, saving a great deal
of money in labor costs.
In order to maintain compliance with the EPA
Stormwater Phase II Permit, the Highway
Division made a vigorous yearlong effort to
visit and clean as many of the drainage struc-
tures as possible and, with use of contract
services, removed silt, sand, and debris from
approximately 8,200 catch basins. The storm
drain cleaning program has continued to
produce a significant repair list as the inspection
process proceeds. The Beaver Dam Brook and
Hop Brook continue to be significant opera-
tional challenges for the division, as even
modest rain events may cause the brooks to
surcharge at the many culvert headwalls in both
South Framingham and the Gregory Road area
of North Framingham. The deficiencies in the
stormwater systems throughout the Town are a
major cause of unscheduled overtime and
emergency repair cost in the department.
In order to minimize the intrusion of sand from
entering and further diminishing the capacity of
the system, the division has continued strict
control practices for the use of deicing materials
during the winter months. In addition, a rapid
and comprehensive post- winter street cleaning
program is performed annually to remove as
70
Page 82
Town of Framingham
much sand from the streets and thereby mini-
mize the opportunity for accumulation in the
system.
The division also performed routine overnight
sweeping of the streets and sidewalks of the
commercial areas to minimize the entry of
materials into the drainage system and to
provide a cleaner environment in the downtown
area. The removal of sand and debris from the
Town's catch basins and manholes remains an
operational priority each year.
Pavement Management
The 2009 construction projects included the
replacement or upgrade of roadway elements
and appurtenances so that both regulatory
guidelines and directives were adhered to and
visual enhancements could be made. New
pavement markings, street signs, sidewalks,
granite and bituminous curbing, wheelchair
ramps and curb -cut control measures were
addressed during the construction. The projects
addressed more then six miles of public ways
this in addition to preventive and emergency
road and bridge repairs.
Winter Storm Management
The Highway Division is responsible for the
provision of a safe automotive and pedestrian
environment both during and after winter
storm events. This effort involves the plowing
and treating of 550 lane miles of public road-
way, 22 municipal parking facilities, and 77
miles of sidewalks and public pathways. The
division has integrated the Town's Geographi-
cal Information System (GIS) with an Incident
Command Structure to manage each event. The
purpose of this strategic effort is to provide a
high level of accountability while applying the
minimum quantity of resources to each storm
event.
Tree Warden & Forestry Management
The Highway Division is responsible for the
maintenance management of the Town's
estimated 12,000 public street trees and for the
development of a Public Shade Tree program
for the community. The purpose of this pro-
gram is to promote, preserve, and enhance the
Public Works 
2009 Annual Report
shade -tree environment of the community
through the application of best management
practices and public education campaigns.
The department planted 45 trees throughout
the town in 2009. Additionally, the islands in
the adjacent areas were landscaped.
The Highway Division oversees the Town's
roadside vegetation management program,
which is permitted annually by the Massachu-
setts Department of Environmental Protection.
This program allows the department to apply
best management practices for the control of
curbside vegetation that otherwise would grow
uncontrollably and require the commitment of
substantial and sustained labor to control
growth. A primary and recurring function of
this operating group is the statutory require-
ment to maintain the 14' -6" height clearance
over the 550 lane mile roadway network. The
Town's shade trees, while providing a great
public amenity to the Town, require routine
maintenance so that they do not also become a
public liability.
The tree warden conducts frequent hazardous
tree assessments, prescribes treatment, oversees
removals, and participates in public hearings on
issues related to trees within scenic ways. The
department routinely responds to citizen
inquiries and requests for service, and Forestry
Section personnel removed several dead or
diseased street trees in 2009. The tree crews
performed tree pruning for road and sidewalk
clearance on several streets included in the 2009
Annual Road Resurfacing Plan.
Department staff continued a town -wide tree
survey to identify tree hazards and diseases so
that we may provide and promote tree health
and support and an overall accounting of street
trees, which may benefit the Town of Framing-
ham in federal and state grant applications.
Traffic Systems Management
The Traffic Systems section of the Highway
Division manages the maintenance, fabrication,
and placement of the Town's regulatory and
street signage, steel beam safety guardrail,
installation of new and annual maintenance of
71
Page 83
Town of Framingham
pavement markings, and the work zone safety
program for division operations. This section is
responsible for advance planning of traffic
management coordination for roadway con-
struction, as well as for the implementation of
street by street "no parking" postings required
to efficiently advance the street sweeping
program. The pre -planning for traffic manage-
ment during the construction season maximizes
the efficient production of the work, and also
contributes to a safe environment for the
motorists and the work crews alike.
The Traffic Systems section managed the
contract and divisional painting of 86 miles of
yellow centerline, 92 miles of white edge line,
and over 600 crosswalks throughout the Town.
In addition, the division installed and or
replaced hundreds of regulatory signs and
advisory signs, either by direction of the Board
of Selectmen or as required through routine
maintenance practices.
SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
PROGRAM
Solid Waste Management. The Solid Waste
Management Program is responsible for the
management and oversight of the Town's
Solid Waste and Recycling Programs. Materi-
als are collected by means of curbside and
containerized collection programs, the leaf
and yard waste drop -off area and the opera-
tion of a Resource Recovery Center located
on Mt. Wayte Avenue. The division collects
and manages the collection of refuse and
recycling from 19,503 dwelling units weekly,
averaging more than 3,900 stops and 135,328
pounds per day collected.
In 2009, the division continued to see the
positive results of our town -wide comprehen-
sive recycling initiatives. The Department of
Environmental Protection (DEP) has certified
the town's overall recycling rate increased from
33% for 2007 to 35% for 2008 and gains have
been make in 2009 as well. The Massachusetts
state average 
is 30 %.  This demonstrates a vast
improvement in Framingham's recycling rate
from the 23% rate four years earlier. The
Public Works 
2009 Annual Report
recycling initiative continues to encompass four
major parts:
School and Municipal Participation. The
school recycling program continues to succeed
and grow. The program is now institutionalized
in most of Framingham's schools. Framingham
is the largest generator in the northeast region
of the country participating in the Abitibi paper
recycling program. Our school program has
now become a state model for the successful
implementation of recycling in public schools.
Public Education. 2009 continued the
monthly theme and events program. Some of
these themes have encompassed targeted
programs such as: paper recycling, plans for
bottles and cans, household hazardous waste,
composting and yard care, recycling and the
economy. Others have been linked to an event.
One such event was the Shred Fest, which
allowed residents to have their confidential
documents shredded and recycled free of
charge. Framingham once again generated more
tonnage from this event than the City of Boston
or the City of Worcester, which held identical
events.
Enhancements and Initiatives. Single stream
recycling, or "all in one container,"continues to
be well received and successful. During 2009
the division provided an additional 1,000
yellow, 32- gallon recycling containers. There are
now over three thousand of these containers in
use. Single stream recycling and the use of these
larger containers continue to play a significant
role in increasing our recycling rate. The
division is exploring the possibility of even
larger containers in the future.
Compliance education program. Since 2006,
the division has issued over 14,400 non -
collection and non -compliance notices. These
notices were issued for various reasons, such as:
excessive recyclables or yard waste intended for
curbside disposal (violates State Waste Bans),
disposal fees required for selected items and
hazardous wastes. The three 35- gallon trash
barrel limit enforcement program has been
successful. 95% of Framingham is now in
compliance with the trash barrel size and
volume limitations. Without the current poll-
72
Page 84
Town of Framingham
cies, the resulting cost saving would not have
been realized. While most residents comply
with the Town's solid waste requirements,
regulatory compliance efforts will continue. In
2010 we hope to reevaluate the temporary use
of 45 gallon barrels and have a mandatory
recycling policy approved by the Selectmen.
The Resource Recovery Center (RRC),located
on Mount Wayte Avenue, continues to improve
and provides the department the opportunity to
expand upon the services offered. Last year the
division issued 6,830 permits to residents
providing access to the solid waste services
offered at the facility. This represents an
additional 151 permits issued over 2008. The
center continues to provide excellent service at
reduced costs to the residents, as well as
generate a significant revenue stream for the
Town.
In addition to the hazardous and hard to
manage wastes collected, the center collected
418.37 tons of recyclables and curbside 4,964
tons were collected. This represents a trash
disposal cost avoidance of $468,070. The Town
has partnered with the Town of Wellesley in the
marketing ofrecyclables. This has produced a
greater revenue stream for the recyclables
received. Through fees collected for divisional
services and marketing of the recyclables,
171,440 was generated for the General Fund.
2009 also was the first full year for local busi-
ness use of the RRC. The facility is now open
on Thursdays for permitted businesses and
residents to recycle. This was done to help
generate additional revenues for the Town
while at the same time reducing disposal costs
for local businesses.
The 2007 reorganization of the yard waste
drop -off area has continued to produce signifi-
cant savings and benefits in 2009. The current
configuration dramatically increased department
oversight of the materials accepted. As a result,
we have been able to partner with the Town of
Needham for disposal of a portion of these
materials. This partnership reduced the cost of
the disposal from a high of $9.70 per yard to
Public Works 
2009 Annual Report
30 per yard. Although the costs of trucking
and fuel have increased, the collaboration has
allowed this budgetary account to remain level
funded. The facility received, processed, and
handled over 14,600 yards of brush, grass and
leaves from residents, the Park and Recreation
Department and the School Department during
2009.
WATER AND WASTEWATER
MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
The Water and Wastewater Program is respon-
sible for the provision of a drinking water
supply, a fire suppression service, and a sewer
collection service to the 70,000 residents of the
community that it serves.
The Water Department is responsible for the
distribution of a public potable water supply
and for the provision of fire suppression service
to the 17,000 residential and commercial
accounts within the community. The average
daily water demand of nearly seven million
gallons per day ( mgd) is purchased from the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority
MWRA) and is  subsequently distributed
throughout the Town by means of a compli-
cated system of pumps, pipes, valves, and
reservoirs. The Water Department program
provides for the maintenance and repair to the
water distribution infrastructure that includes
250 miles of pipe, 17,000 service connections,
2,000 hydrants, 4,800 gate valves, 22,000
meters, 4 pumping stations, 3 booster stations,
and 6 above -ground water tanks having a
storage capacity of nearly 9 million gallons.
The Wastewater Department is responsible for
the collection and transport of 10 million
gallons of sewage each day, a significant portion
of which is infiltration and inflow (1 /1) from
sources such as leaking pipes and sump pump
discharges during wet weather. Sewage is
conveyed from Town systems to the Massachu-
setts Water Resources Authority (MWRA),
which is charged with the transport and treat-
ment of sewerage from its forty -three member
communities. The Town's collection system
consists of 226 miles of gravity mains, 18 miles
of force mains, 50 pump stations, 6,600 man-
73
Page 85
Town of Framingham
holes, and over 40 miles of cross -country
sewer -line easements.
The division's capital improvement programs
have been substantially underfunded in recent
decades, and as a consequence, the critical
infrastructure is experiencing ever -increasing
incidents of failure. The system continued to
grow and expand over time, but the funding for
the aging and expanding infrastructure did not
keep pace with capital needs. As a consequence,
the Division was historically engaged solely in
performing unscheduled maintenance and was
unable to devote resources to perform critical
maintenance to the system. This is underscored
by the issuance of an Administrative Consent
Order (ACO) and Notice of Noncompliance by
the Massachusetts Department of Environ-
mental Protection (MADEP) in March 2007.
The ACO requires the Town to undertake
major sewer construction and rehabilitation
projects over several years with the primary
focus of alleviating reoccurring sanitary sewer
overflows, a violation of State and Federal law.
The ACO has several other requirements
including increased staffing levels, major
equipment purchases, implementation of a
supervisory control and data acquisition
SCADA) system to remotely monitor and
control pumping stations and strict reporting
requirements. Failure to comply with the
conditions of the ACO can result in administra-
tive civil or criminal action.
The department also faces the continuing
challenges of managing another Administrative
Order, originally issued by the Massachusetts
Water Resources Authority in 2003. The
MWRA Settlement Agreement limits the level
of sulfide that the Town is authorized to
discharge to the MWRA system through
operational efforts. Sulfide generation can cause
odor and corrosion problems in sewers, which
sometimes can be catastrophic. Activities the
Wastewater Department performs to mitigate
the generation of sulfide include chemical
dosing at selected wastewater pumping stations,
targeted collection system cleaning and inspec-
tion, and enforcement of grease interceptor
requirements at food establishments. A major
Public Works 
2009 Annual Report
cause of sulfide is the wastewater detention time
associated with the 50 pumping stations and 19
miles of related sewer force main sewer. The
Department plans to eliminate up to eight
wastewater pumping stations and related force
mains over the next several years as part of its
Capital program.
In recent years the Department of Public
Works has developed a  professional and
knowledgeable staff at all levels and disciplines.
This progression has provided an opportunity
to identify and fully carry out some capital
projects from design thru construction using
solely Public Works staff. This practice not only
provides the Town with a significant cost
savings over contracting for these services but is
used as a tool for continually training our
employees. During 2009 water or sewer infra-
structure was replaced using this approach in
Stalker Lane, Pincushion Lane, Franklin Street
Extended, Pearl Harbor Road, and Spring Lane.
The aforementioned planned construction
activities were in addition to the excavations
required by department staff to repair nearly
300 water system failures and 180 sewer system
failures during the course of the year.
The department began installation of the
Automated Meter Reading (AMR) system early
in 2009, and approximately 75% of the Town's
water meters are now being read remotely. The
AMR system provides the utility billing office
with real time, on- demand, water meter read-
ings resulting in a substantially higher level of
customer service to water and sewer customers.
It is anticipated that all 21,000 meters will be
outfitted with the new reading device by the
end of 2010.
The Water Department was the recipient of the
MADEP's 2009 STAR -L Award in recognition
for its efforts in taking action to reduce and
eliminate lead in drinking water. The depart-
ment was honored for working in tandem with
the Framingham School District to survey
schools, test their water, and educate the school
community on how best to reduce lead content
in water.

The Water Department's Emergency Response
Plan (ERP) was updated during 2009 to comply
with the revised Massachusetts Drinking Water
Regulations. The new regulations include
specific requirements for ERPs and notification
requirements for reporting to the MADEP and
the Board of Health such emergencies as loss of
water supply, contamination incident, acts of
vandalism and other potential or actual emer-
gencies requiring immediate action in order to
protect public health.
CONSERVATION COMMISSION
The Conservation Commission Office is
responsible for implementing local, state, and
federal wetland laws, managing over 400 acres
of conservation land, and engaging the public in
resource conservation efforts.
The Conservation Office is responsible for
reviewing all proposed and on -going municipal,
private, commercial, and industrial projects to
determine if they fall under the jurisdiction of
local, state, and federalwetland laws. Conserva-
tion staff conducts site inspections and attends
pertinent meetings. Staff advises and provides
technical expertise to the Conservation Com-
mission to avoid legal action against the Town
and protect the environment. Other duties
include: managing conservation land owned by
the Town; overseeing the Framingham Stew-
ardship Program; directing the Aquatic Man-
agement Program and providing education and
outreach to residents.
1. Wetlands Protection Achievements. The
commission:
Reviewed, for jurisdictional relevance, all
applications for 188 Building permits, 37
ZBA permits, and 21 Planning Board per-
mits;
Held 27 Public meetings to discuss project
applications, land management efforts, and
public education efforts;
Reviewed and permitted 37 Notices of
Intent applications;
Reviewed 15 and permitted 12 Requests for
Determination applications;
Permitted 5 Emergency Certifications 
2009 Annual Report
Performed over 90 site visits and inspec-
tions to gain first -hand information on site
conditions and verify wetland delineations.
The commission continued to oversee active
projects from prior years. It issued:
Amended Orders of Conditions for project
changes;
4 Permit Extensions;
18 Certificates of Compliance;
2 wetland violations in 2009.
2. Land Acquisition and Stewardship
Achievements. With help from the Framing-
ham Stewardship Program, the Conservation
Office continued to make improvements to its
conservation land, running seven work days on
conservation parcels. Efforts focused on
removal of trash and brush, contribution to
Green -Up Day, creation of new trails, mainte-
nance of existing trails, etc. The Conservation
Office also coordinated with four Boy Scouts
undertaking Eagle Scout projects on conserva-
tion land.
3. Educational Achievements. The Conserva-
tion Office held three environmental education
programs in 2009: nature walks /scavenger
hunts on three town properties that were
attended by 26 residents. The Conservation
Office will continue to offer educational
programs while exploring new topics of interest.
4. Administrative Achievements. The Con-
servation Commission works closely with
DPW, Park and Recreation.,Planning Board,
Building Department.,and ZBA to ensure
compliance with state and local wetland laws.
Conservation Commission staff works closely
with several local organizations, such as Sud-
bury Valley Trustees, New England Wildflower
Society, Bay Circuit Trail Alliance, SuAsCo Wild
and Scenic River Stewardship Counsel, and
Massachusetts' Department ofConservation
and Recreation to protect the Town's wetland
resource areas and open space. The office
continues to provide opportunities for volun-
teers.

FLEET, FACILITIES &
COMMUNICATIONS MANAGEMENT
The Fleet, Facilities and Communications
program continues to provide a critical support
service to various public works programs and
provides vehicle and equipment maintenance
support to other agencies within the Town. The
program is accountable for: the development
and implementation of professional fleet
management standards and practices, the design
and procurement of all public works vehicles
and equipment, the provision of standardized
maintenance management practices for all
Public Works facilities, including Water and
Wastewater Pumping Stations. The division is
also charged with the technical management of
the telecommunications network and thereby
provides a critical service component to the
department's Emergency Management response
plan.
The Fleet, Facility, and Communications
Division's role is to provide logistical support to
the department through the provision of fully
operational equipment, facilities, and telecom-
munications that together, ensure the effective
and efficient delivery of essential services to the
residents of the community. These vital services
include the provision of public safety, public
works, and public utility functions for the
residents of Framingham. It is the mission of
the Fleet Management Program to support the
operational programs that provide these critical
services through the efficient management of
Public Works facilities and all division equip-
ment so that it effectively meets or exceeds its
anticipated service life.
Fleet Management
In 2009 the division prepared specifications for
the procurement of the following specialized
equipment: two F series heavy duty cab &
chassis's with plows— Highway Division, one
68,000 GVW Refuse packer— Sanitation Divi-
sion, one four -wheel drive utility body truck
with plow, one backhoe /loader and one
overhead bucket truck— Wastewater Division. 
2009 Annual Report
The Division also prepared specifications for
the major repairs of CAT loader #451 -Highway
Division.
The Massachusetts Department of Environ-
mental Protection supplied the Town with four
retrofit kits to help reduce emissions on our
off -road equipment. This was done under the
Northeast Diesel Collaborative Emissions
Reduction -Voluntary Diesel Retrofit Program
grant program.
This was the third winter season that a tempo-
rary site at the King School was created for
technicians who are assigned to be on the north
side of Town during plowing events. This has
worked very well in providing the technicians a
more functional area: repairs have been per-
formed more effectively.
In 2009, Fleet Services wrote 2 repair
orders, performed 423 scheduled preventive
maintenance services and performed 143
Commonwealth of Massachusetts Registry of
Motor Vehicles Enhanced Emissions State
Inspections.
The division also managed the acquisition &
distribution of more than 241,000 gallons of
gasoline & diesel fuel.
Facility Maintenance
Each year the Department of Environmental
Protection Stage II Vapor Recovery Certifica-
tion program is performed for the fuel system
at Western Avenue along with the annual
calibration of the fuel pumps which is per-
formed by the Town's Sealer of Weights &
Measurers. This year we had to add another
certification called a "Third Party Inspection,"
which is now required by DEP. The oil /water
separators at Western Avenue and the Transfer
Station are inspected quarterly and pumped out
in compliance with DEP regulations as needed
but at least annually. Full load tests are per-
formed on the emergency/ standby generators
at both Western Avenue and Henry Street
quarterly to insure proper operation. The annual
fire sprinkler inspection was performed at
Western Avenue facility.
Public Works  76
Page 88
Town of Framingham
A new fuel management program was installed
and the in- ground fuel system delivery lines and
unleaded fuel pump were also upgraded.
Repairs to the fuel delivery pad area were
performed so as to provide current fuel fills.
We have installed an energy management
system at the Western Avenue facility. This was
50% funded by an NSTAR grant program in
the amount of $36,625. The remainder will be
financed through NSTAR over a 2 -year period
at 0% interest. The estimated energy savings
according to NSTAR's calculations are an
estimated $ 24,700 per year. We have also
installed energy efficient light fixtures in the
Fleet Maintenance repair shop through another
NSTAR rebate program, which has doubled the
light quality in the repair shop.
Fleet Services conducts a monthly inspection of
the Watson Place flood station and performs
any necessary repairs.
This year a proximity card security system was
installed at the Western Avenue facility. This
system will work in conjunction with the
department's time and attendance management
system and will also be the employee ID card.
Doors and windows at the Winter Street pump
station were upgraded and an overhead door
was installed so as to be able to store equipment
and do pump maintenance.
ADMINISTRATION & FINANCE
The Administration and Finance Division
provides for the consolidation of all administra-
tive and financial functions within the Depart-
ment ofPublic Works. The division strives to
enhance the efficiency and accuracy of financial
and administrative functions within the depart-
ment through the use of professional practices.
The core mission of the Division of Admini-
stration &  Finance is to provide service and
technical support to the major divisions within
the Department of Public Works: Engineering,
Conservation, Highway, Solid Waste, Fleet,
Water and Wastewater, as well as providing
other Town departments with information in a
timely and accurate manner.
Public Works 
2009 Annual Report
The division is also responsible for the man-
agement of grant funding, as well as federal
reimbursement activities that are related to
storm emergencies and other events.
Water and Sewer utility billings for the Town of
Framingham are also managed by this division.
Staff issued approximately 73,000 bills in 2009.
Residential customers in Framingham are billed
quarterly for water and sewer usage, while
commercial, industrial and high volume cus-
tomers are billed monthly. The staff also
administers the Senior Discount and Utility
Abatement policies on behalf of the Board of
Selectmen.
In 2009 a new software system was purchased
for utility billing activities. This robust software,
along with the benefits of the automated meter
reading system, will greatly improve the effi-
ciency and accuracy of utility billing and en-
hance customer service. The new software is
targeted to go into production in spring 2010.
In 2009 the department entered into an agree-
ment with ENEROC, an energy management
group, leveraging electric capacity at four of our
larger facilities for financial incentives. The
Town receives quarterly payments for our
ability to transfer electric loads off of our power
supplies and onto established auxiliary power
sources in the event of system emergencies on
the power grid. The town receives a guaranteed
annual capacity payment regardless of whether
we are requested to activate our auxiliary power.
In 2009 the department continued to focus on
streamlining administrative processes. Working
with several vendors, the department was able
to eliminate the need to process over 370
individual power generation and natural gas
invoices through the use of consolidated
invoices. Internet resources provided by the
vendors and supporting documentation on the
consolidated statements retain the ability to
analyze and verify charges.

The Community and Economic Development
Division (C &ED) undertakes a wide variety of
projects, all of which are focused on protecting
and enhancing the quality of life for Framing -
ham'sresidents. The projects are multi-
dimensional, ranging from securing grants and
providing policy analyses to promoting home-
ownership and strengthening the tax base by
encouraging appropriate new development.
The Division consists of three departments:
Planning, Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA),and
the federally funded Community Development
office. While each department focuses on
different planning functions, there are strong
interrelationships between and amongst the
departments as well as other municipal divi-
sions, boardsandcommittees. Therefore,
ongoing coordination is critical.
Planning
The Planning component of the division is
concentrated on both promoting economic
development and supporting our residential
neighborhoods. Planners, with a full spectrum
of professional expertise and experience,
manage a wide variety of projects and provide
policy analyses requested by the Town Manager,
Board of Selectmen, and other divisions.
Economic Development
The department is committed to promoting and
supporting appropriate economic development
in order to expand and strengthen the tax base
to improve the quality of life for Framingham's
residents. An effective economic development 
strategy must be multi- faceted and include a
range of strategies and economic development
tools that are tailored to the specific characteris-
tics of an area.
Promote Downtown Revitalization. The
department is responsible for coordinating an
extensive array of ongoing and planned proj ects
directed at revitalizing Framingham's central
business district. The division works closely
with the Department of Public Works, Building
and Wires Department, the Town Manager's
Office, and Planning Board as well as state,
regional and federal agencies and legislators to
insure that all projects are moving forward in a
coordinated and expeditious manner.
Underlying the Town's approach to improving
the economic viability of Downtown Framing-
ham is the recognition that public infrastructure
improvements are critical to leverage private
investment—without public investment to
facilitate vehicular and pedestrian circulation
patterns, improve safety, and beautify the
downtown, it is unlikely that developers will be
sufficiently motivated to invest in the down-
town.
Working closely with DPW and its consultant
as well as Planning Board staff, C &ED has
helped guide the development of a long -term
revitalization strategy for the downtown that
addresses the rail crossing issue, seeks to
incorporate Farm Pond into the downtown,
promotes mixed use development, significantly
improves safety and traffic flow, and enhances
Planning & Economic Development  80
Page 92
Town of Framingham
the physical appeal ofthe downtown. This is a
coordinated approach that consists of several
interrelated phases and components that are
moving forward simultaneously.
A working group of town officials and staff
including representatives of C &ED as well as
engineering and landscape architects under
contract to DPW, released its recommendations
on the future of downtown including prelimi-
nary recommendations to address the rail
crossings during the summer of2009. In
consultation with C &ED, DPW is negotiating a
contract to proceed with Environmental
Reviews of various alternatives, as required by
the State. The Town is workingwith the State
to release existing earmarks to contribute to the
design costs.
Simultaneously, the Town has engaged in
ongoing discussions with both the State Gov-
ernment— including the Lt. Governor—as well
as CSX, which owns over 200 acres of land
dedicated to railroad use in the downtown.
Plans are nearing completion that are more
short term in nature. Specifically, the Pro-
grammatic Study, being conducted in coordina-
tion with the overall Downtown Plan, will be
submitted early in2010. These plans will
include major traffic improvements to the two
Y" intersections ( Union /Concord and Ir-
ving /Hollis) to allow for signal coordination
and provide improved safety for pedestrians
and vehicles.
Finally, the department works with both
Framingham Downtown Renaissance ( FDR)
and an emerging downtown merchants associa-
tion to incorporate their concerns into our
planning processes.
Revitalize Neighborhood Commercial
Areas. Whereas the downtown is a focus of
our economic development efforts, it is clearly
just one of a number of projects town -wide that
were undertaken or expanded upon during
2009. The commercial centers in Nobscot and
Saxonville and around Mt. Wayte and Franklin
Planning & Economic Development 
2009 Annual Report
Streets were identified as areas that warrant
revitalization. C &ED maintained its previously
established relationships with the property
owners and continued to convey the Town's
willingness— indeed eagerness to work closely
with them and any prospective tenants or
buyers in order to revitalize those areas.
Implement Brownfields Project.
Framingham unfortunately has a considerable
number of brownfields, which are properties
that contain or potentially contain hazardous
substances, pollutants or contaminants that
complicate the expansion or redevelopment.
Brownfields are not only blight on our town but
are typically underutilized, thereby representing
enormous potential to generate significant new
property taxes once they are abated or it is
established that that they are not contaminated.
The department has focused significant energy
on securing funding to identify, abate and
eventually redevelop brownfields. Our efforts
to secure that funding have been successful and
will continue in future years. As aresult ofan
application submitted by C &ED in 2008, the
Town received a second $200,000 grant from
the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in
April of 2009 to undertake comprehensive site
assessments ofbrownfields. Thissecondround
of EPA grant funding brings total funding to
400,000 and will focus on property potentially
contaminated by petroleum -based substances.
This category includes gas stations and former
auto dealership and repair sites.
The Division continues to implement the four -
year project, which involves targeting sites,
working with property owners, and hiring a
licensed site professional to conduct site
assessments ofselectedproperties. Significant
progress was made, including selecting a highly
qualified consultant, developing a website for
public outreach, creating an inventory of
properties and conducting environmental site
assessments on several properties.
Encourage Appropriate Economic Devel-
opment. New development is one ofthe few

mechanisms available to expand the tax base,
thereby reducing the financial burden on
existing property owners and /or increasing the
availability of funding to improve municipal
services. In recognition of the tremendous
potential of Technology Park, C &ED works
with both prospective developers and the State
to encourage and facilitate appropriate devel-
opment. Further, given the Town's commit-
ment to convert Tech Park into a world -class
facility that is consistent with the image of its
life sciences and research and development
tenants, C &ED continued to work closely with
DPW in order to insure that sufficient water
and sewer capacity is available to respond to the
needs of future developments. Toward that
end, the department is participating in a part-
nership of Town departments and Technology
Park property owners to undertake a compre-
hensive Capital Improvement Program to help
identify infrastructure needs includingwater and
sewer, traffic, and streetscape improvements.
C &ED participates in a quarterly meeting with
Tech Park and representatives of the Town to
identify issues of mutual concern and how we
can strengthen our partnership to address these
issues.
The department is also working to target and
promote the development of major parcels for
re)development throughouttown. Although
the lack of available credit has seriously under-
mined the progress of several private develop-
ments, we are focused on some of the
opportunities presented by vacant and underuti-
lized property in the downtown and commu-
nity -wide including neighborhood shopping
areas ( as expanded upon above).Working
relationships established in the prior year were
nurtured with several major property owners so
that we can partner to plan for the future.
Essentially, we have to view the economic
recession as an opportunity that will provide us
time to create a strong foundation upon which
to build when conditions improve.
Protect and Improve Residential Neighbor-
hoods. While economic development initiatives
Planning & Economic Development 
2009 Annual Report
support residential neighborhoods by generat-
ing additional taxes, C &ED also undertook
projects that were directed specifically at
protecting and improving Framingham's
neighborhoods. The department continued to
respond to a Board of Selectmen policy that
places a priority on encouraging homeowner-
ship and targeting efforts to vulnerable
neighborhoods.
Neighborhood Stabilization Program. The
dramatic increase in home foreclosures that
began in 2008 continued through 2009.
Accordingly, C &ED continued to implement
the Foreclosure Action Plan, which it developed
in 2008 in partnership with the Building Com-
missionerandBoard ofSelectmen. The Plan,
which focuses on prevention and management
of foreclosures as well as neighborhood stabili-
zation, served as the basis for the Neighbor-
hood Stabilization Program ( NSP) and an
application for federal funding to help imple-
ment the Program. Inresponsetothedivi-
sion's application, the Town received $700,000
in federal foreclosure assistance administered
through the Commonwealth.
NSP represents the work of C &ED and the
Board of Selectmen as well as the direct and
critically important involvement of the Fram-
ingham Housing Authority ( FHA) and its
subsidiary, the Framingham Housing Develop-
ment Corporation. The overriding focus ofthe
NSP is to promote homeownership by convert-
ing foreclosed properties into owner -occupied
homes to help stabilize neighborhoods. Three
properties were acquired in 2009 and will be
rehabilitated and sold to income -eligible families
in 2010.
The success of our program led to additional
funding requests for $150,000 from the Attor-
ney General's office and $500,000 from the
Commonwealth. Theaward letterfromthe
Attorney General's office was received at the
end of the year and the Commonwealth' s grant
application was still pending at the close of
2009.

Pursue State and Federal Grants. The
department continued to monitor the applica-
bility of grants as well as research the availability
of funding for specific projects. In order to
insure that all municipal departments are eligible
to receive State grants, the department annually
submits a Commonwealth Capital application,
which essentially grades municipalities on their
success in meeting State objectives and man-
dates. Framingham was awarded the 4th
highest score in Massachusetts in 2009, which
positions us extremely well for state grants.
The department applied for and received close
to $2 million in grants during 2009 as follows:
700,000— Neighborhood Stabilization
Program ( NSP) to implement its Fore-
closure Plan
200,000 —EPA Brownfields grant to
focus on petroleum -based contamination
150,000— Attorney General's Aban-
doned Property Rehabilitation Grant to
supplement NSP funding, awarded in rec-
ognition of C &ED's ongoing success in
implementing the $700,000 NSP grant re-
ceived earlier in the year
657,Energy000—Efficiency &
Conservation Block Grant to help retrofit
Memorial Building and install solar panels
on the Barbieri School roof (with the in-
valuable support of the Capital Buildings
Project Manager)
270,000 State PARC Grant to imple-
ment Phase IV of the Cushing Park Reno-
vation Plan (in conjunction with Parks &
Recreation)
The department also applied for the following
grants that remain pending:
50,000 Recreation Trails Grant to fund
site amenities for the Cochituate Rail Trail
500,000 NSP funding to supplement
existing grants.
Planning & Economic Development 
2009 Annual Report
Finally, the department has coordinated major
Town -wide efforts to submit the following
requests for funding:
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
ARRA) funding for an estimated $232 mil-
lion in projects
Federal appropriations for projects totaling
189 million
Federal transportation ( SAFETEA -LU)
projects totaling in excess of $122 million
The department is available to provide direct
staff support to divisions throughout the Town
in identifying and preparing grant applications.
The extraordinary assistance and cooperation
provided by other municipal and school
departments have been instrumental in the
C &ED Division's success in securing grants.
Provide Policy Analyses, Studies, Project
Management, and Special Projects. C &ED
undertakes projects, prepares policy analyses,
and coordinates inter -departmental projects,
including the following:
Transportation. C &ED works closely with
DPW to insure that the Town's transportation
improvement priorities are identified on the
state's Transportation Improvement Plan (TIP),
which is a prerequisite for state funding eligibil-
ity.
Cochituate Rail Trail ( CRT). C &ED is
responsible for the design and ultimate con-
struction of the 1.3 -mile CRT in Saxonville.
Plans to enter into a 99 -year lease with the
MBTA were replaced with acquisition of the
property in order to accommodate the DPW's
East Framingham Sewer Improvement Project
EFSIP). The division is working closely with
DPW to coordinate design and construction
activities along the rail trail. With the help of
the CRT Advisory Committee, the Town's
engineering design firm prepared design plans
for the trail and assisted in permitting the
project with the Conservation Commis-
sion. The basic infrastructure of the trail has
been included in EFSIP with anticipated 
83
Page 95
Town of Framingham
construction in 2011. C &ED is working to
explore grant and funding opportunities for
completing the CRT.
Bruce Freeman Rail Trail (BFRT).C &ED
manages the planning process to develop the
Framingham component of the proposed 25-
mile rail trail that will extend from Lowell to
Framingham. A 6.8 mile portion ofthe BFRT
in Chelmsford opened in September. C &ED
has been seeking grant funding as well as
working with the regional committee represent-
ing all of the communities through which the
trail will traverse.
Subsidized Housing Inventory. The division
closely monitors the Town's status on the
Commonwealth' s Subsidized Housing Inven-
tory (SHI) in order to insure that Framingham's
subsidized housing units are accurately and fully
counted. The Town's SHI remains in excess of
10 %,  which exempts Framingham from Chap-
ter 40B developments ( subsidized housing
development that is not subject to municipal
Zoning Codes). As a result of C &ED's dili-
gence, the State recertified 81 units that had
been removed from our inventory. The
division is also poised to insure that an addi-
tional 150 units will be placed on the inventory
as soon as they meet State eligibility require-
ments (expected in 2010).
Provide Support to Town Committees
C &ED provides staff support to several Town
committees, including:
Economic Development Industrial Corpo-
ration ( EDIC).The EDIC is charged with
creating a pro -active capacity within the town to
plan for and carry out economic development
activities. Keyprojects included:
Continuing discussions with property
owners and others about potential devel-
opment opportunities
Participating in  Brownfields and
Branding efforts 
2009 Annual Report
Agricultural Advisory Committee ( AAC).
We are very sad to report the passing of Com-
mittee Chair Charles Hanson, who died in a
tragic farming accident in August. His lifelong
dedication to Framingham's agricultural com-
munity will be sorely missed. We are pleased to
report that Mathew Hanson, Charles' grandson,
joined the Committee as an alternate. George C.
Harrington is now the new Committee Chair
and Thomas Hanson (Charles' son) is now the
new Vice -Chair. In 2009 the Committee
successfully worked with the Board of Select-
men to implement a policy for handling proper-
ties that are withdrawn from the Ch. 61 taxation
program, which provides for reduced property
taxes for those who maintain their property in
agriculture, forestry or recreational use. The
Committee also provided input to the Planning
Board regarding Master Plan goals and policies,
reviewed and commented on farming -related
bills pending before the State and Federal
legislatures, and continued to move forward on
creating a  community garden in southern
Framingham.
Multiple Hazard Mitigation Planning
Group. The C &ED Director serves on the
group, which consists of representatives of
various Town divisions as well as citizens. The
group is responsible for overseeing the imple-
mentation of the Town's Multiple Hazard
Mitigation Plan, required by the Federal Disas-
ter Mitigation Act of 2000. During 2009, the
Group was kept apprised of DPW's commit-
ment to implement a number of strategies
identified in the Plan, including but not limited
to: installing stream gauges installed at Route
9 /Sudbury River and Beaver Dam
Brook /Second Street Bridges; documenting a
100 -year storm in the summer that affected
residences in the Angelica, Baiting and Hop
Brook areas; and obtaining several new portable
pumps to be used during flooding events. The
Group provided a public service message that
was included in the fall tax bill about flooding
and steps residents can take to mitigate flood
impacts. The Group initiated efforts to update
the Plan consistent with federal requirements.

Zoning Board of Appeals
Memorial Building, Rm B2 ' 1  502 -532 -5456
zba@framinghamma.gov
The Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA) is the
Permit Granting Authority and the Special
Permit Granting Authority for those projects
not meeting the requirements of the Framing-
ham Zoning Bylaws. The ZBA's function is to
approve or deny requests for variances and
special permits, and issue findings through the
public hearing process by determining if the
required criteria, as stated in the Zoning Bylaw,
has been met. In addition, the ZBA administers
the Comprehensive Permit process for afford-
able housing as set forth under M.L. G.Chapter
40B.
The ZBA is a three- member Board, appointed
by the Selectmen. In 2009, Full Members of the
Board were Philip R. Ottaviani, Jr.,Chair; Susan
S. Craighead, Vice -Chair; and Stephen E.
Meltzer, Clerk. Karl Thober, Edward ( Ted)
Cosgrove and Robert Snider continued to serve
as Associate Members. There is one Associate
Member vacancy. Eugene Kennedy, Assistant
Director of Community and Economic Devel-
opment, continued his duties as ZBA Adminis-
trator. Mr. Kennedy prepared the Board's
decisions and advised the Board on procedural
and other issues. Alice Clapper continued her
duties as 
Administrative Assistant. Town
Counsel continued to advise the Board as
required.
Forty -five (45) petitions were filed with the
ZBA office in 2009. Seven (7) petitions that
were filed in 2008 were decided in 2009. This
total of fifty -two (52) cases is 21% less than the
fifty -seven (57) cases processed in 2008.
Of the fifty -two (52) cases heard in 2009, 14
were requests for Variances, 1 Amendment to a
Special Permit, 31 for Special Permits, 3 for
Findings, 1 for Variance & Special Permits, and
2 Appeals of the Decision of the Building
Commissioner. Variance and special permit
requests included those for relief from dimen-
sional requirements for: construction of, and
Planning & Economic Development 
2009 Annual Report
additions to, single family homes; placement of
sheds on residential properties; construction of
two- family residences, and automotive and
restaurant uses, and changes of use for local
business owners. Some of these filings were the
outcome of changes in zoning districts in past
years resulting in non -conforming lots.
The Board meets on the second and fourth
Tuesdays of every month at 7:00 P.M. in the
Deborah D. Blumer Community Hearing
Room. Members of the public are welcome and
encouraged to attend ZBA meetings.
Community Development.
Since 1975, Framingham has received over 19
million dollars through the Federal Community
Development Block Grant Program ( CDBG).
The Town also receives Home Investment
Partnership Act (HOME) funds, which are
directed exclusively to housing projects. In
combination, the Programs seek to: arrest
deterioration in the housing stock and stabilize
neighborhoods through financial and technical
rehabilitation assistance to property owners;
develop programs to preserve and expand
affordable housing opportunities; eliminate
architectural barriers; improve Town -owned
facilities and infrastructure to prolong their
useful life and stabilize neighborhoods; improve
the quality of life for low and moderate income
residents through the provision of social
services; and administer the programs effec-
tively and equitably to ensure that all members
of the community can participate in or benefit
from program activities.
The following summarizes several major
accomplishments during 2009:
Housing Rehabilitation Assistance
HRAP). provides technical and financial
assistance for the rehabilitation of housing
units. Sixteen living units were helped orwere
in the process of being helped through HRAP
assistance and related services through the
provision of grants and loans to property
owners who have low or moderate incomes or
the majority of whose tenants have low or 
85
Page 97
Town of Framingham
moderate incomes. HOME funds were also
used to undertake the rehabilitation of 10
additional housing units. Staff provided admin-
istrative support in the Division's implementa-
tion of the Neighborhood Stabilization
Program featuring the acquisition, rehabilita-
tion, and resale of foreclosed and abandoned
property.
Homebuyer Assistance provided homeowner-
ship opportunities to income -eligible house-
holds with HOME funds. Seven households in
the income range of 80 -100% of median family
income became homeowners through the
Program's referral of those households to the
MassHousing Partnership Soft Second Loan
Program.
Code Enforcement. The Program provides
funding to conduct code -related inspections to
properties located in eleven Census Block
Groups with a majority of its population having
low or moderate incomes. Inspectional staff
with the equivalent of one full -time position
made possible by CDBG funds) and one
administrative staffperson were hired. Staff
speaks and understands Spanish and Portu-
guese. The Building Department maintains a
data base on inspectional findings, and maps
where problems are occurring. During the past
program year, over 500 inspectional cases were
initiated and closed.
Public Facilities Improvements: Accessibil-
ityAdaptations. CDBGgrants continued to
fund several handicapped accessibility im-
provements to the Memorial Building, including
the installation of a new automated lift linking
the first floor to the Union Avenue meeting
room and office wing. The program also
funded: the installation of new sidewalk and
accessible curb cuts along Winthrop Street in
the Coburnville neighborhood; construction of
accessible sidewalks and a pedestrian crossing
area; and renovation of water, sewer, and
drainage connections and initial street resurfac-
ing at the Rose Kennedy Lane Elderly Housing
complex.
Planning & Economic Development 
2009 Annual Report
CDBG funds were allocated to study, design,
and eventually construct an accessible entrance
to the Village Hall.
Funds were used to upgrade public parks and
recreational facilities including the final phase of
installation of more energy efficient and effec-
tive lighting in the heavily used Danforth
Gymnasium, plus the provision of new basket-
ball back boards and nets, and the installation of
benches to complement a newly developed
family play area at Butterworth Park.
Facade and Sign Improvement Program.
Assistance was offered to business and property
owners as well as merchants, located in and
around Framingham' s central business district
and surrounding commercial core, to undertake
facade, signage, and storefront improvements.
Three ( 3) sign improvement projects were
undertaken and a fourth designed for installa-
tion in early 2010.
Public Services. The following initiatives were
undertaken with CDBG funds to serve youth: a
summer employment and counseling program
Community Connections Summer Work
Program); and a  special program for high
school students who faced issues that have
impeded their ability to learn and achieve
Resiliency for Life). CDBG- funded adult
programs included: literacy training ( Literacy
Unlimited); English -as -a- 
Second Language
Framingham Adult ESL Plus);and limited
financial assistance to prevent homelessness
Homeless Prevention Program).  Over 400
individuals were served by the activities.
Subsidized Housing Support. HOME funds
supported subsidized housing projects includ-
ing: Shillman House UCHE) pre -
development assistance ( 10 housing units),
FHA Memorial House pre -development design
feasibility (10 units),and FHA Rose Kennedy
Lane rehabilitation ( 14 units placed under
agreement).

The Planning Board strives to work with both
project proponents and the public to shape
projects that minimize impacts to the commu-
nity while accommodating new growth. Such
growth provides excellent employment oppor-
tunities and a growing tax base to the Town.
Framingham continues to be an attractive
market for significant new development, as well
as reuse of existing sites. Highlights of the year
and of the range of projects before the Planning
Board in 2009 are provided below.

storage, mechanical and research and develop-
ment operations. The space will also have a
basement and a cafeteria. There is a net de-
crease in the amount of impervious coverage of
approximately 436 square feet after the expan-
sion. The existing building currently has an
assessed value of $17,300.005,00. The applicant
estimates "total development cost" within the
meaning of the By -Law of approximately
11,000.400,00; while it is difficult to estimate
the ultimate impact on the building's assessed
value following completion of the improve-
ments, the applicant projects an assessed value
of approximately $30,000.000,00 following
completion of construction.
Framingham Housing Authority, 2 — 72 Pearl
Harbor Road
The Board approved the application by the
Framingham Housing Authority ( FHA) to
renovate and expand its existing public housing

new specialty retail tenants, an approximately
25,000 square foot health club, medical offices,
and service establishments such as a bank in
two buildings of 14,900 square feet and 55,020
square feet respectively. The project and site
improvements will integrate the development
and its functions into historic Saxonville Village.
A new passive recreational area (the "Pocket
Park ") will be created along the Sudbury River,
west of the parking area, providing needed
public access to the Sudbury River.
Clark's Hill, EveratAvenue
The Board approved the application by John R.
Parsons, Jr.,Manager and principal of Clark's
Hill Commercial Center, LLC proposal to
construct a building for offices and research
and development on a parcel of vacant land
located along the southerly side of the existing

be three stories in height and will have a gross
floor area of approximately 51,600 square feet.
At the request of the Board and in order to
increase the amount of landscaped open space
on the site, the applicant filed an Application
for Reduction in the Amount of Required
Parking Spaces, reducing the amount of off -
street parking to 180 parking spaces, including 7
handicapped spaces. The property has a current
assessed value of $523,00. 900. It generates
current total property tax revenue of approxi-
mately $15,00. 428.The applicant projects that
the value of the completed and occupied
building will be approximately $ 5,000,460,
which will result in post -development annual
real estate taxes in the amount of approximately
160,00.797.
Vastewater Management Facility, 67A Street
The Board approved the application of the
Framingham Public Works Department repre-
sented by William Sedewitz, Chief Engineer,
and James Barsanti, Project Manager, to
construct a Wastewater Management Facility.
Planning & Economic Development

SPECIAL PLANNING STUDIES
Townwide Master Plan
In relation to preparation of a Master Plan,
M.L, G.Chapter 41 81D states, "A planning
board established in a city or town or such part
or parts thereof as said board may deem
advisable and from time to time may extend or
perfect such plan."In 2007, the Board began
the development of Framingham's first com-
prehensive Master Plan since 1988.
The Board completed the first phase of the
Master Plan and published the Baseline Condi-
tions Report, which is available online. The
commencement of the second phase of the 
88
Page 100
Town of Framingham
Master Plan was delayed, due to lack of funding.
Town Meeting approved the appropriation of
unassigned mitigation funds to complete the
Master Plan.
The Board has engaged the Cecil Group to
complete the plan. The Cecil Group has held
meetings with Board members and with other
stakeholders. The draft goals and policies with
implementation strategies will be completed by
summer 2010. The Master Plan will be com-
pleted winter 2010.
Comprehensive Improvement Plan for the
Framingham Technology Park
The Board, as a condition of their site plan
approval for Genzyme's Biologics Support
Center and with the agreement of Genzyme
Corporation, initiated a planning process to
develop a comprehensive improvement plan for
the Framingham Technology Park. The Board
engaged Terra Tech Rizzo to provide develop
the plan. The planning process is a collaborative
effort between town officials and park owners
and tenants.
The plan will evaluate the sufficiency of current
infrastructure to meet the forecasted develop-
ment needs and will explore options for sub-
stantially upgrading the appearance of the park
in a comprehensive and cohesive manner. The
plan will, in a specific way, define expectations
related to streetscape elements such as lighting,
signage, pedestrian accommodations, and
landscaping so that any upgrades to the park
through public grants or private initiatives are
done in a manner consistentwith a documented
plan. The plan will address broader issues
related to transportation and utility infrastruc-
ture and emergency services in a more general
way, focusing on identifying current and future
system deficiencies and potential solutions. The
draft plan will be issued April 2010.
ADMINISTRATION
The Board has continued to work with the
Town Treasurer's Office to require prospective
developers to obtain certification from the
Town's Treasurer /Tax Collector that no local
taxes, fees, assessments, or other municipal
charges are outstanding prior to submission of
Planning & Economic Development 
2009 Annual Report
an application. As a result, many applicants
have been obligated to bring unsettled accounts
up to date before the Board would consider
their development proposals. Since first em-
ployed in May of 1993, this noteworthy process
has been a source of substantial uncollected
taxes for the Town. In calendar year 2009, the
Board collected $366,00000.in past due taxes
and fees. By the end of calendar year 2009,
2,348.268,72 had been collected to date.
The Board continues to improve the website to
increase availability of information to the
public. The Zoning By -Law and Subdivision
Regulations will be available for downloading
and printing to make the document more
widely available to the public. The Board
continues to post on the website zoning
amendments, which are current through Annual
Town Meeting 2009, weekly agendas and
approved minutes. Submissions for larger
projects review are available on the Board's
website. A specific Master Plan webpage is also
available, which provides citizens the ability to
keep updated on the status of the plan, find out
where and when public participation sessions
will occur and be able to provide comments or
questions from this page. A webpage will also
be constructed for the Comprehensive Infra-
structure Improvement Plan for the Framing-
ham Technology Park.
Once projects are approved, the Board also
ensures that they conform to the conditions of
approval by conducting conformance reviews
during the permitting and construction phases
for approved projects.
In calendar year 2009, the Board collected a
total of $49,05418.in revenue from associated
project review fees and from the sale of Zoning
By -Laws, Zoning Maps, Subdivision Rules and
Regulations, and minor miscellaneous revenues.
In addition to these contributions to the
General Fund, the Planning Board obtains
significant Town -wide amenities through the
process of negotiated mitigation. In the course
of its review the Planning Board requires
applicants to provide improvements such as
roadwaywidening and reconstruction, signaliza- 
89
Page 101
Town of Framingham
tion, enhancements for public transportation
and landscaping to offset adverse project
impacts. In calendar year 2009, the Board
received $377,00000.in mitigation performance
guarantees and payments.
UPCOMING YEAR
Calendar year 2010 will be a challenging year for
the Board. The Board will continue to review
the following major development proposals.
Crossroads Corporate Center, 923 Pennsylvania
Avenue
The Board is reviewing the proposed Office
and R & D development. The proposal is to
demolish the three existing buildings on the site
and replace them with two office towers of

The project will consist of approximately 36,000 
2009 Annual Report
square feet of new construction with landscap-
ing, lighting, and parking improvements for a
new Water Resource Center (WRC).The WRC
will primarily function as a treatment facility to
remove iron and manganese from the extracted
groundwater. The proposed withdrawal from
the well site is 1,570 million gallons per year,
which represents an average dailywithdrawal of
4.3 million gallons. The site is located offRiver
Path Drive in the northeaster area of Framing-
ham. The site is bordered by wetland resource
areas to the north, River Path Drive to the
south, and vacant land to the east and west. The
operation of the Water Resource Center will
provide a significant financial benefit to the
water rate payers of the Town of Framingham.
The WRC will incorporate a learning center to
allow school tours and provide an educational
opportunity for the Town of Framingham. In
addition, the project is planned to eventually
include a trail system throughout the property
to allow for passive recreation activities.
In conclusion, the Board will also continue its
review of the Danforth Green PUD. The
review was restarted bythe owner recently. The
Board also anticipates additional development
application filings by Genzyme Corporation.
The Board will also be completing the Master
Plan and Comprehensive Infrastructure Im-
provement Plan for the Framingham Technol-
ogy Park.

Metrowest Regional Transit
160 Waverley Street, Framingham, MA
The MetroWest RTA was created by a vote of
the Framingham and the Ashland Boards of
Selectman in December of 2006. By the sum-
mer of 2007, seven additional communities had
joined, a budget and fares were put in place, and
an Administrator was hired to oversee the daily
operation of the LIFT, which had been under
the Framingham Planning Department.
MWRTA "  fixed route" service was then
initiated on December 1s`,2007, with a new
contracted provider and 10 new buses obtained
from Federal and State grants. At the same
time, the MWRTA was paying the MBTA to
continue its RIDE service in the Framingham
and Natick area.
In 2008, the original Framingham LIFT and the
Natick Neighborhood bus routes were inte-
grated into a unified transit system, which has
resulted in improved service and continued
growth. That year, Marlborough and Southbor-
ough joined MWRTA, expanding the author-
ity's demand response service delivery by 2,000
rides a month. In 2009, the authority, through a
Federal grant, expanded again to create a link to
the Woodland MBTA Station in Newton
Route #1) setting the stage for an "interopera-
bility" project using the Charlie Card. Addition-
ally, the authority took over the MBTA's RIDE
provision in Framingham and Natick expanding
again the demand response provision by
another 5,000 rides a month.
Growth of the system is supported by a staff
dedicated to personal, friendly and helpful 
2009 Annual Report
service to every customer. This focus on
customer service has been augmented by the
authority's leadership in the use of technology
to provide reliability and convenience.
Route #1, as mentioned above, is MetroWest's
link to the MBTA's Green Line. Routes #2 and
3, which loop entirely within Framingham, are
the most highly traveled routes; consistently
averaging over 4,000 rides a month. Route 4
connects Market Basket to the Shopper's
World /Mall area and provides service to the
Beaver Street neighborhood. Route #5 con-
nects Framingham to Hopkinton, Route 6
connects Framingham to Holliston, and Route
7, which also consistently averages over 4,000
rides a  month, connects Framingham to
Southborough and Marlborough. Routes 10, 11,
and 12 serve Natick and its commuters and
elderly. Route #9 is a component of Route #1
during the commuter hours and runs exclusively
on Route 9 during the off -commute hours.
The MWRTA will continue to build upon the
over 400,000 rides provided in FY09 by using
technology, an emphasis on customer service
and the more effective and efficient delivery of
transportation service. For further details and

Barry Bograd served as chairman with other

The Annual Town Meeting voted an annual
operating budget of $2,472200, for Parks
Administration, Maintenance and Recreation.
This was a 3% reduction of a level- funded
budget, which resulted in the decrease of one
full -time position, three Seasonal Laborers and
two Summer Laborers.
A highlight of the year was the implementation
of the renovation of the Bowditch Field
Athletic Complex. Seaver Construction was
awarded the contract for both the Maintenance
and Operations facility and the Bowditch
Stadium improvements. The final designs will
resolve all of the major problems cited in the
Bowditch Master Plan. The scope of work and
final expectations should include essential
municipal stadium functions such as appropri-
ate seating, press box, decorative block wall
construction of the locker rooms and bath-
rooms, all with a landscaped look. There will be
an improved image to the streetscape along
Union Avenue. Added to the scope of work
were three historical walls inside the home side
plaza. They will contain interpretive signage
capturing the unique history of the prop- 
Capital funding included the purchase of a new
Stake Body Pick Up Truck; Cushing Phase 4,
which will address the Winter Street side of the
park; and Infrared heating at Loring Arena. All
projects are expected to be implemented in
2010.
Butterworth Park was improved with Commu-
nity Development Block Grant money and
private fundraising by the Rotary Club. CDBG
provided for the removal of old and unsightly
utility poles, new basketball backboards, and
park benches. The Rotary provided for the
installation of a new Evos playground installa-
tion.
The commission successfully sponsored an
article at the Fall Town Meeting to transfer 3.68
acres of 410 Water Street from the Board of
Selectmen to the jurisdiction to the Park and

Many successful applications for alternative
resources included requests for Mitigation funds

As the decade concluded, the Recreation
Division remained active by offering 200 plus
programs for 15,000 registered participants.
There was an increased interest in the wrestling
program, start smart programs, summer basket-
ball clinics and the men's slow pitch softball
league. New programs included Zumba classes,
additional preschool classes, and the latest new
tennis offerings with our recent partners at the
Longfellow Tennis Club in Wayland.
Once again we are thankful to the many
successful grants that enhanced our 2009
programs. The Framingham Grants panel of the
Metrowest Community Health Care Foundation
granted us an additional six months of funding
for the popular Kid Fit Program, the Depart-
ment of Public Health, and the State of Massa-
chusetts provided funding for Youth at Risk
programming. Endicott College provided an
Intern student for a semester and Future Skill
funded two summer counselors for our Recrea-
tion Centers. 
2009 Annual Report
For the second year in a row, the Framingham
Town Summer Swim Team finished with a 10 -0
record; they also placed first in the Mile Swim,
and placed first in the Regional A Swim Meet.
The 190- member team (ages 6 -18) was led by
the enthusiastic coach, Joey Sementelli along
with help from assistants, Aubrey Courville and
Kristen Shippe, Joe Lessard and Chris Peterson.
The PAL basketball league, led by Director
Tom Click, challenged the New England
Patriots in an exciting game of Basketball. Steve
Gostkowski, Pierre Woods, and Ellis Hobbs
participated for the Patriots, who won by two
points in a nail biter at the buzzer.
The department transferred their web site to the
Town's page at Civic Plus. The new design can
be accessed at:
httl2:// framing_V,www.hamma.ovLparks
This change will now allow for the addition of
the new e- letter, cancellation updates, and new
and upcoming events.
One of the highlights of the year was the
groundbreaking event at Bowditch Field.
Attendees enjoyed speakers sharing their stories
of times gone by and the historical aspect of the
site, as well what to anticipate seeing in the
future when the proj ect is completed. Everyone
had the opportunity to preserve a little piece of
history by taking home a concrete piece of the
old stadium. We look forward to the grand re-
opening ceremonies in 2010.
We would like to thank the Town Selectmen,
Town Meeting Members, Town Staff, and
numerous community volunteers for their
continued support. Without your endless
continued support we would not be successful
in offering our quality programs to the residents
of Framingham.

PARKMAINTE14ANCE
The Park Division moved its maintenance
operation to the new facility located at 175
Fountain Street in the Loring Complex. The 2.3
million dollar project was funded through the
Capital Budget. This facility is ideally located
next to the Keefe Vocational School and will
enable the department to efficiently perform
operations.
There continues to be an increase in demand
for practice and game field facilities. With over
14,700 formally scheduled events, including the
support of the athletic programs of three high
schools, the middle school athletic programs
and two colleges, overuse and the decline in turf
quality is again a major area of concern. We
continue our strategy of field rotation and
limiting usage, but we're met by the challenges
of not having enough space for all groups. The
increase in participation and extended seasons
of some of the seasonal sports has led to the
increased demand and overuse.
The department strives to collaborate with
many outside groups. The $50,000 renovation
of Fuller Field was completed thanks to the
effort of the Youth Lacrosse program, Fram-
ingham State College and Town Resources. A
new Evos playground was installed at Butter-
worth Park through cooperative efforts and
resources from the Rotary Club. The town -wide
beautification program at roadside islands has
also been a  successful collaboration with
commercial groups willing to make donations to
upgrade and beautify these areas. Our relation-
ship with Keefe Technical School continues to
allow our department to complete many major
Parks & Recreation 
2009 Annual Report
projects including a rehabilitation of a building
located in Cushing Memorial Park, the renova-
tion of the Bowditch bathroom facility, and part
of the electrical demolition for the Bowditch
Field project. This mutually beneficial relation-
ship provides the Town of Framingham with
access to cost -effective, professionally super-
vised electrical, carpentry, plumbing, and metal
fabrication, while affording students the benefit
of practical "real world" learning experiences in
a commercial setting.
Due to budgetary constraints, the tree pruning
and removal program was reduced significantly.
We are concentrating on hazard trees and trees
with obvious structural defects. It is hoped that
this program will continue through the future,
as problems will increase over time.
The Beach Storm Water Improvement at
Learneds Pond was completed prior to the
beach season. Improvements included re-
grading and lifting of the existing parking area
and additional handicap accessible measures.
This projectwill benefit the water quality of the
pond and bring the Town closer to compliance
with several Local, State, and Federal policies
associated with storm water management.
We continue to give support and resources to
other Town departments including the School
Dept.,Building Services, the Department of
Public Works, and Conservation. We would like
to thank all of the Town departments, volun-
teers and groups for the cooperation they have
provided throughout the year. Itwould be very
difficult for us to achieve the success we have
without their help.

The Final Phase of the Center was completed
this year; programs are being held in this area
including but not restricted to a Choral Pro-
gram, the Friends of Callahan General Meeting,
AARP educational programs, guest speakers, a
monthly movie, a Latino Health and Wellness
Forum, and entertainment and other programs.
The Center now has integrated some weekend
events to this large function room. These
included Senator Karen Spilka's Annual Health
Fair, an event which educates older adults
concerning what resources are available to them
to live an independent and healthy life; the I st
Annual Hospice & Future Care and Considera-
tions Forum, where a number of topics were
discussed with residents who needed informa-
tion regarding hospice care. Both seminars
included volunteer health and wellness profes-
sional organizations. The Friends ofCallahan
held a weekend indoor yard sale, which in-
cluded other vendors for the purpose of raising
money for the betterment of the Center. The
staff donated their own personal time, as well as
baked goods and other items to this endeavor.
Additionally this year, the Center established a
part -time Wellness Nurse position funded by a
grant from a private donor. Muscle Building
classes (photo at top of section) were increased
to three sessions weekly to meet the needs of
those participants with arthritis. A Balance Class
was developed for those frail older adults who
were prone to falling. The Caregivers Support
Group instructor gave notice that this support
group would no longer be available. Our
licensed clinical social worker came forward to
lead this support group. We established a TOPS

returned to the Callahan Center to benefit older
residents by assisting them with their taxes. A
college student is now working at the Center on
an internship, providing social services to older
adults. The Center hopes to integrate more
college interns in the work at the center. The
Computer Learning Center established a
computer program which is dedicated to those
seeking employment and is available several
days a week.
The Friends of Callahan, a 501C(3) non -profit,
donated funding to the Center for several
projects including 10K for a new copy machine
for the staff use; replaced outdated computer
equipment in the computer room; donated
funding to purchase materials for those who are

During the summer of 2009, a new electric
motor for the compressor was installed to
replace the original 46- year -old motor. The
compressor is a key component to running the
refrigeration system. This new motor is more
efficient in running the compressor. The motor
cost $4,37. 685. The installation was done by 
98
Page 110
Town of Framingham
Arena staff. New perimeter piping was added to
the front of the ice surface. The original piping
pulled away from the boards about 6 inches,
causing that part of the ice not to freeze.
Installation was done by American Refrigera-
tion and cost $2,085. Approximately 1,200
gallons of glycol were drained from the piping
and reinstalled by arena staff, saving the arena
approximately $2,000.
New batteries were installed in the electric
zamboni at the cost of $7798. Currently, we are
one of the only rinks that have been getting 6
years out of the batteries. The average life of
these batteries is approximately 3 to 4 years.
The extended life of our batteries is mainly due
to scheduled maintenance done by arena staff.
Removal and disposal of the batteries were
done by rink staff and Park and Recreation
staff.
The Loring Arena Legacy Foundation donated
a brand new hockey scoreboard and message
center. Cost ofthis new scoreboard and mes-
sage center was $13,735. Removal of the old
scoreboard, which was the original scoreboard
from 1993, was done by arena staff, Waverly
Tool, and Park and Recreation staff. The
installation cost of $1,200 was paid by the
Arena. Electrical work was done by arena staff.
The size of the scoreboard is 18'x3'.

SCHOOL COMMITTEE
Budget
The School Committee's FY10 budget devel-
opment process was particularly complicated
because of two factorsa free -falling economic
situation and the lack of clarity about federal
stimulus funds. On April 14, 2009, the School
Committee voted to request an FY10 budget
appropriation from the Town of $87,829.346,
The requested amount matched the Chief
Financial Officer's guideline and represented a
0% increase over the FY09 budget appropria-
tion. To reach this budget guideline, the School
Committee made reductions of 21.6 full -time
equivalent positions (6.1 teachers, .5 administra- 
tors, and 15 teacher's aides). Some of the
reductions were made possible because of
enrollment shifts, but many required changes in
district programs, particularly in Special Educa-
tion and English Language Learner services.
When the Massachusetts House of Representa-
tives' budget was released with reduced aid and
revenue assumptions, both school and munici-
pal allocations had to be reduced. The Chief
Financial Officer asked Framingham Public
Schools to lower its budget request by $1
million to an FY10 appropriation request of
86,829, 346,a 1.2% reduction from the FY09
allocation. On May 4, 2009, the School Com-

quested FY10 allocation to this level. At the
time, Governor Patrick had promised $3.5
million in federal stimulus dollars ( ARRA-
American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of
2009) to the Framingham schools because the
district, one of 163 districts statewide, was in
danger of falling below the foundation level of
funding. These anticipated dollars were built
into the FYI budget appropriation request that
was discussed and approved at the annual Town
Meeting. However, the stimulus in its final
form provided less than the anticipated amount,
and the schools were faced with a $964,966
deficit to start FYI 0. As the 2009/2010 school
year began, district administrators closed the
budget gap through a series of cost -cutting
measures including a  district -wide budget
freeze, energy conservation measures, and
eliminating plans to fill key vacant positions.
In August, the School Committee unanimously
voted to convene a Finance Subcommittee as
part of a larger School Committee goal to
facilitate effective communication between the
School Committee, Finance Committee, Town
Meeting, and other Town Boards.
School Property on A Street
In September 2009, the Town asked the School
Committee to transfer school property to the
Town for purposes of the development of the
East Framingham Sewer Improvement Project
EFSIP).The undeveloped lot was located at
the intersection of A Street and Concord Street.
The School Committee developed a series of
proposed restrictions for the project for
consideration as part of the Planning Board's
Site Plan Review Decision. The proposed
restrictions, which were agreeable to the
Department of Public Works, would ensure
student safety and minimize interruptions to
learning during the construction process and
after its completion. Ultimately, the School
Committee retained a buffer strip of land for
screening purposes and authorized the remain-
ing acreage to be transferred to the Town for
the new wastewater management facility. 
2009 Annual Report
District Reorganization Proposal
Superintendent Steven Hiersche and the district
administrators worked on a reorganization
proposal in the summer and fall. Former
Superintendent Eugene Thayer's District
Planning and Review Task Force laid much of
the groundwork for this transition. The initial
proposal was presented to the School Commit-
tee in January 2010.
The Committee
In April 2009, incumbents Beverly Hugo and
Andy Limeri were elected to second terms. New
member Richard Finlay was elected to a one -
year term, the final year of former member
Cesar Monzon's term. Later that same month,
Philip Dinsky resigned from the School Com-
mittee after sixteen years of service. In May, the
School Committee and the Board of Selectmen
jointly appointed Carol Phalen to fill the vacant
seat until the April 2010 Town election.
The School Committee would like to thank the
Framingham Public Schools' faculty, staff, and
administration for the superb work that they do
each and every day. In addition, we would like
to thank the citizens of the Town of Framing-
ham and Town Meeting for their continued
support of the school system. It is truly a
privilege to represent the Framingham commu-
nity in supporting our outstanding public
schools.

The College Board's Advance Placement
Program ( AP) offers students the opportunity
to take challenging, college -level courses while
still in high school and to receive college credit,
advanced placement, or both for successful
performance on the AP Exams. Since 2002, the
number of students taking the AP exams has
more than doubled, with three hundred and
sixty three participating in 789 Advanced
Placement Exams in twenty -two subjects, in
2009. 87% of the exams were passed and
eligible for college credit. This compares with
three hundred forty three who took the exam in
twenty -one subjects in 2008.
Through continuing aggressive efforts of the
FHS Guidance Department, 95% of the junior
class and 87% of the sophomore class took the
Preliminary Scholastic Assessment Test (PSAT).
These numbers are impressive compared to the
fact that 65% of the junior class and 46% of the
sophomore class took the test in 2004. With
more graduates having chosen to begin their
post -secondary education at two -year commu-
nity colleges, which do not require the SAT,
79% of the graduating class participated in the
SAT. Framinghamstudents averaged 522 on
the Critical Reading portion, 563 in the Mathe-
matics portion, and 524 on the Writing Com-
ponent. These scores compare well with
national averages, which are 501, 515 and 493
respectively.
The community should be proud that so many
students take and pass a wide variety of these
college -level exams, and that they do so well.
One result of the high student achievement is
acceptance at a college or university to continue
education. In keeping with past years, more
than 88% of the graduates in the Class of 2009
continued their education at an impressive
variety of institutions of higher learning,
including some of the most selective colleges in
the country.
The Fine Arts program in Framingham schools
continues to grow at all levels. A few examples
of their accomplishments are: Walsh Middle
School won a Gold Medal at the 2009 Massa-
chusetts Middle School Drama Festival for their
Education & Libraries 
2009 Annual Report
production of The Seussification ofRomeo and ju&l..
Fuller Middle School participated in the Massa-
chusetts Middle School Drama Guild Festival
and earned a gold medal for their excellent
performance of School Da .Ze. In addition, Fuller
Middle School Jazz Band performed at the
Massachusetts Association for Jazz Education
District Festival and earned a Silver Medal;
three additional students were awarded an
Outstanding Musician Award. Five Cameron
Middle School students won Boston Globe
Scholastic Art Awards. The Framingham High
School Drama Company has been invited to
represent the United States at the Drama
Festival in Scotland in the summer of 2010.
Over 2000 schools are nominated and only 50
are chosen. They will perform Once on This
Island, the show they performed in 2008 that
won them the prestigious honor of performing
in Scotland. In addition, The Drama Company
was a State Finalist at the Massachusetts High
School Drama Festival, and two high school
students were selected, from thirty who audi-
tioned, to play in the All -State Orchestra.
The School Department continues to work
diligently on its efforts to become "greener."
Framingham Public Schools stood alone in
receiving three honors from the State Executive
Office of Energy /Environmental Affairs for
Excellence in Energy and Environmental
Education."
In keeping with the tradition of excellent
support for the education program, the Town
was able to provide the funding to achieve a
balanced budget for FY10. The School De-
partment is most appreciative of the Town's
assistance with obtaining this. One of our major
goals is to establish systems and monitor the
finances to provide a transparent financial
picture for the community.
Jae Goodwin, Dunning Elementary School
teacher, was 
named 2010 Massachusetts
Teacher of the Year. Ms. Goodwin was selected
from more than forty nominees. Each year, the
Massachusetts Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education Teacher of the Year
program honors a Massachusetts teacher who
102
Page 114

exemplifies fine teaching. The purpose of the
program is to select a teacher who is worthy of
speaking for and energizing the teaching
profession. Framingham School Department is
proud to have Jae Goodwin teaching our
students.
After three years without an Assistant Superin-
tendent, we hired Dr. Christine Tyrie to fill this
vacant position. She has also taken on the
responsibility of Director of Curriculum and
Professional Development. Dr. Tyrie comes to
Framingham from Blackstone Millville Regional
School, where she was Superintendent. We are
very fortunate to have her join our administra-
tive team. Her experience with finance and
curriculum has been an asset.
In closing I would like to thank not only the
entire staff for their diligent efforts on behalf of
our students but also the School Committee
and Town officials for their attention to the
education of our students. Working together
creates a positive and productive environment
and I appreciate everyone's participation.

This year our new elementary math program,
Think Math, has been successfully implemented
in each of our elementary schools. Turning our
attention to literacy, the elementary and middle
schools have piloted a computer -based screen-
ing assessment to identify students reading on
or above grade level as well as students reading
below grade level. The district is preparing to
strengthen its three -tier model of reading
instruction so that students reading below grade
level are given additional instruction and
students reading above grade level can be
appropriately challenged. This approach is
consistent with the new student growth model
unveiled by the Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education, where not only MCAS
scores but also each individual student's aca-
demic growth is taken into account to deter-
mine acceptable school level performance.
Education & Libraries 
2009 Annual Report
There are several science and technology
initiatives underway. The high school has
partnered with the Fall River Public Schools
and was awarded a grant to develop on -line
courses for students. The first application of
these courses will be for students who cannot
attend school regularly during the school day.
Student computers for the Thayer Campus were
included as part of this grant. A number of
middle school eighth grade science teachers willparticipate in developing blended science
lessons, i.e.,a part of the lesson will be accessed
by students on -line and a part in face -to -face
instruction. This offering is through a grant that
ACCEPT, one of our education collaborative
partners, has received. Elementary teachers at
Stapleton and Dunning are piloting a science
module from a  science curriculum entitled
Science Companion. The teacher materials for
the pilot are entirely on -line and students
receive science notebooks to support them as
science investigators. In addition, a small group
of Stapleton and Dunning pilot teachers will
participate in a Museum of Science weeklong
workshop this spring.
There are eleven High Tech —High Touch
classrooms identified now for implementation
in fall 2010. These teachers will not only use
technology in their classrooms to engage all
students, but have agreed to be demonstration
classrooms where colleagues, parents and
community members will be able to track
progress, visit and support further technology
integration.
The district is committed to collecting and
acting on student achievement data. Data show
that our special populations (special education,
low income, limited English proficient) are not
always achieving at the same levels as their
peers. Our more capable students are not
always challenged. As someone new to Fram-
ingham with responsibility for curriculum and
instruction, I  am excited about shifting to
increasing effective instructional practices in all
content areas.

ADULT ESL 
Pl us
Framingham Adult ESL enrolled 690
students in each of two semesters for 2009.
Students came from 33 countries and spoke 15
different languages. They ranged in age from 18
to 85. Students attended a.m. or p.m. English as
Second Language classes, Adult Basic Educa-
tion classes, GED preparation classes, or
Citizenship Preparation classes. All were eager
to improve their English skills and in doing so
become better integrated into the Framingham
community.
Twenty -five students graduated from the
program's highest level and eight students
received their GED after successfully passing
the GED examination. Attendance for the year
was excellent, with over 80% of enrolled
students completing each semester.
Highlights of 2009 include:
170 students receiving "CPR For Friends
and Family" training with the assistance
of The American Heart Association.
The Stress of Immigration Support
Group, which provides counseling sup-
port to Portuguese and Spanish speaking
students enrolled in evening ESL classes.
The Metrowest Community Healthcare
Foundation provides funding for this im-
portant service.
Participation in the "Framingham Reads"
project with the book Three Cups ofTea
Class visits to The Danforth Museum,
The Framingham History Center, The
State House, The Framingham Public Li-

The effectiveness of educational programming
Plus
at Framingham Adult ESL is measured by
the Performance Standards for Adult Education
Programs issued by The Massachusetts De-
partment of Elementary and Secondary Educa-
tion (formerly the Department of Education).
The standards include the following areas.
Attendance -  Programs ensure that students
attend between 66% and 76% of planned
Education & Libraries 
2009 Annual Report
student hours. Framingham Adult ESL Plus
achieved an attendance rate of 83 %.  Pre and
Post Test Percentage -  Programs ensure that
between 66% and 76% of eligible students
are pre and post tested using the DESE's
approved assessment tools Framingham
Adult ESL Plus 
pre and post- tested 89.74% of
students. Learner Gains -  Programs ensure
that between 35% and 49% of students
demonstrate gain as defined for each ap-
proved assessment. 55% of students at
Framingham Adult ESL Plus made measur-
able gains. Setting and Meeting Goals -  Pro-
grams set on average at least 2 goals per
student per year and programs meet on av-
erage at least one goal per year. Students at
Plus
Framingham Adult ESL set, on average,
3.76 goals per year and met 2.6 goals per
year.
Another indication of program effectiveness is
increased student involvement in the area's
economy, schools, and greater community.
Students report joining school parent organiza-
tions, becoming more active in youth groups,
getting jobs, attending training programs, and
starting businesses. Framingham Adult ESL Plus
also has an active volunteer component through
which some of the hundreds of wait -listed
students can receive 2 hours each week of
tutoring. At present there are 8 volunteers who
are former students in the program. They have
decided to "give back" to the program that
helped them so much.
On March 30, 2009, The Metrowest Adult ESL
Fundraising Committee hosted a successful gala
to support Framingham Adult ESL Plus This
annual event, spearheaded by Middlesex Savings
Bank and attended by many area businesses,
raises funds to support 6 classes each year. The
support of the local business community as well
as many agencies and individuals is of tremen-
dous importance, especially in helping to
address the ongoing waiting list of over 500
eager students.
Framingham Adult ESL Plus has demonstrated
tremendous growth since it' inception by a
104

Town of Framingham
group of town meeting members in 1984.
Plus
Framingham Adult ESL is fortunate to be in
a school system and a community that value
lifelong learning and appreciate its diversity of
residents. We look forward to continuing to
give back to the community, which has been so
supportive.

ENGLISH PROGRAMS
During 2009, Framingham Public Schools
continued to serve as a leader in educating
English language learners. With at least 60
different languages represented in our school
district, it has been our goal to ensure that each
student achieves in all academic areas while
acquiringEnglish. Forthe fourth consecutive
year, the Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education's Annual Measurable
Achievement Objectives ( AMAO) report shows
that the percentage of English language learners
that made progress in learning English and the
percentage that attained fluency in English
surpassed the goals by 17 percentage points and
9 points respectively.
Teachers across the district and those from
other districts have participated in a wide variety
of professional development opportunities
offered by our staff. These include: assessing
English language learners, sheltering content,
and effective instructional practices for English
language learners. This year, as in past years, we
were pleased to have a number of staff mem-
bers selected to make presentations at several
important educational conferences. We also co-
sponsored a statewide conference on Dual
Language education at Barbieri School.
The mark of any effective program is continued
analysis and self -reflection. For the third year, as
a result of the self -studies we had undertaken of
our Two -Way elementary and secondary
programs, we received a $370,000 state grant to
share this information with other districts
statewide. This fall, we were invited to partici-
Education & Libraries 
2009 Annual Report
pate in a state Board of Education Task Force
to make recommendations on closing the
achievement gap for English language learners.
Parent involvement is an important element in
all our programs. Grant -funded Parent In-
volvement Facilitators at each school plan
meetings and events to involve families in the
education oftheir children. The district received
a commendation from the Department of
Elementary and Secondary Education during its
Coordinated Program Review for our out-
standing work with parents.
The success of our programs is due to the
dedication and expertise of a highly qualified
professional and paraprofessional staff. This
past summer, over 50 staff members partici-
pated in workshops to develop and refine
curriculum, as we continue to refine and
improve the programs for the benefit of our
students and their families.

FOOD SERVICES DEPARTMENT
The continuing effort to combat childhood
obesity while maximizing the nutritional intake
of the students has been the focus of the Food
Service Department over the last year. Great
strides have taken place in the variety of foods
offered at breakfast and lunch at all school
levels. Scratch cooking continues to be the focal
point of the department, with fresh products
being the foundation of all items served. With
that, the overall participation in both lunch and
breakfast has again risen overall by 1.3% from
the previous 12 -month period, with the biggest
participation increase in breakfast-up 1.1%
over the 07/08 school year, an additional 100
meals served daily.
Costs. During this challenging economic period
it is the goal of the Food Service Department to
keep the cost of all meals as low as possible to
benefit the families of the community. With
that, the cost for school lunch ($2.25/$ 50)
and milk ($. 60) was held steady, with the only
increase being in breakfast, bringing the cost up
to $1.50, was the first increase in 4 years for that
meal period.

SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICES
School Health Services ( SHS) provides daily
comprehensive nursing care to the students of
Framingham Public Schools. Nurse staffing
includes one full time nurse in each school, two
nurses at the high school, and two adolescent
Education & Libraries 
2009 Annual Report
health nurses. This year SHS again benefits
from the Massachusetts Department of Public
Health Essential School Health Services (ESHS)
program. ESHS provides funding to SHS to
strengthen infrastructure with personnel,
professional development opportunities, and
equipment, including technology.
SHS responded quickly and efficiently to this
year's HINT pandemic. In close collaboration
with the Framingham Board of Health, impor-
tant and up -to -date HINT information was
regularly disseminated to the school community
via the district website. HINT immunizations
were provided to staff in their buildings. At
three school -based family flu clinics, SHS
nurses were instrumental in administering 5286
seasonal and HINT vaccines.
SHS continues its long history of collaboration
with partners engaged in health care and
research. Collaborations continue with Memo-
rial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center /Boston
University on the SONIC study ( a study
investigating sun exposure, moles and mela-
noma in school -aged children) and the New
England Eye Institute in the operation of the
Vision Center at Fuller Middle School (provid-
ing comprehensive vision care to all members
of the FPS community).As the result of the
community -based Teen Pregnancy Coalition,
formed last year to address increasing teen
pregnancy rates in Framingham, SHS received
funding from two competitive grants proposals,
one from the Metrowest Community Health-
care Foundation and the other from the Massa-
chusetts Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education and the Massachusetts
Alliance on Teen Pregnancy. These grant
monies allowed for a review of the middle
school health curriculum (as it relates to repro-
ductive health) and ultimately, the purchase and
implementation of "Making Proud Choices" in
all three middle schools.
The Teen Parenting and Pregnancy program,
which experienced significant funding reduc-
tions in 2008, continues to serve an average of
48 students each month. Students include
pregnant teens, new teen mothers, and fathers.

Continued existence of this successful and
critical support program for FPS pregnant and

coming year.
SHS is committed to providing preeminent
nursing services to the FPS community. We
look forward to another year of administering
our program.

SPECIAL EDUCATION
PROGRAM
The Department of Special Education provides
a broad array of services for children and youth
identified with disabilities from the ages of three
through twenty -two. The referral, evaluation
and placement procedures are governed by state
and federal special education laws and regula-
tions, namely, The Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act (IDEA).FPS is committed to
the goal of providing an appropriate education
for students with special needs in the least
restrictive setting.
The following programs and services were
offered by FPS from preschool to high school.
Special Education Resource Rooms are avail-
able in each school. The Resource Room or
Learning Center model provides direct teaching
in both special and regular class settings,
through inclusion, supportive teaching and /or
consultation to the regular classroom teacher of
identified children.
There are forty -one Substantially Separate
classes from preschool through high school.
These students require comprehensive pro-
gramming, which is provided outside of the
regular education classroom for more than 60%
of the school day. These classes are located at
the high school, three middle schools, at seven
elementary schools, and at the preschool
serving the special education needs of students
throughout the district. Where appropriate,
these students are included in general education
classes and ancillary activities.

included in a student's Individualized Education
Plan ( IEP).The services are provided by
itinerant personnel at allschools. Inclusion
programs have been established using a variety
of approaches throughout the district. Some
classes are team -taught, some classes meet for
specific periods, and some special education
teachers are assigned to a group of classes. In
addition, some teachers who are dually certified
in special education and regular education have
full -time responsibility for inclusion classes at
the elementary level.
Framingham is a model for preschool programs
for both children with special needs and typical
children ages three to five. The placement of
children with special needs in the preschool
programs emphasizes language, communication
and social skills development. The majority of
children with special needs in the BLOCKS
Preschool Program are integrated throughout
their school day with children without special
needs.
Framingham continues to see a  significant
increase in the number of children with autism,
with multiple disabilities and medical needs, and
with significant social /emotional disabilities,
particularly at the preschool and elementary
levels. The severity of these disabilities presents
challenges to the school district to develop new
and additional programs in order to maintain
these children in the public schools.
In conclusion, Framingham has continued to
implement and provide a  comprehensive
continuum of programs, services, and place-
ment options for students with disabilities.
Framingham is fortunate to have an active
Special Education Parent Advisory Council
whose role is to advise the special education
department and to engage parents of children
with disabilities in the schools through meetings
and town -wide newsletters.

OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY
The Office of Technology is responsible for all
administrative and instructional technology for
the Framingham Public Schools. Seventeen
locations are supported on our fiber optic wide
area network (WAN),over 9,000 users (5,500
network accounts) and almost 3,000 computers.
The Office of Technology is focused on
enhancing and streamlining the teaching and
learning process with an efficient and accessible
network and data management system.
The Office of Technology continues to advance
the district's level of technology integration in
day -to -day instruction by collaborating efforts
with the Office of Curriculum and Professional
Development. To this end, the Office of
Technology now offers the tools to create and
operate online courses via the World Wide
Web. Furthermore, the Office of Technology is
supporting innovative teaching by assisting
teachers through the procurement and use of
emerging educational technologies that improve
instruction.
The 2009 -2010 school year has seen immense
growth in the area of technology. Several
advances are listed and described below.
1. Redefine role of the school -based Tech-
nology Specialists to include teacher and
staff technology professional develop-
ment.
2. Rolled out new district -wide public
website ( content management system)
where each organization creates and
manages its own content:
www.framin
3. The FPS job application process is now
100% paperless with the new Human Re-
sources online application tool.
4. Reduced 50+ physical servers to fewer
than 10 physical servers and 45+ virtual
servers. Server virtualization has drasti-
cally improved productivity and reduced
electricity consumption.
5. 1s` year of a three -year district -wide cost -
saving printing plan. By using Xerox
copiers with Equitrac software, district
Education & Libraries 
2009 Annual Report
personnel can print directly to copiers
therefore greatly reducing desktop print-
ing.
6. Currently unifying student and staff data
under one web -based student informa-
tion system.
7. Implemented archiving of electronic
documents to comply with Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure (FRCP).
8. Implemented new spam /antivirus filter-
ing solution.
9. Installed new district core switch
updating the "central nervous system" of
the district to support a high -speed voice
and data network.
10. Implementedasuiteofwebtools:
1. Self- service FAQs and a Moodle
online course system
2. Access documents from anywhere
tool
3. Password self -service tool
11. FPS video streaming including Flyer
news and school committee meetings is
now available on the public website:
www.kI2.us / framingham.ma.streaming.c
fm
12. Implemented web -based solutions for
SPED and school health data.
13. High School, King Building, and May-
nard Building are now 100% wireless.
The wireless network is designed to sup-
port school -provided computers as well
as personal laptops, netbooks, and web -
enabled mobile devices.
14. 55% federal E -Rate district -wide discount
last year increased to 61 % this year. This
discount applies to Internet and tele-
phone services.
15. Voice over Internet Protocol ( VOIP)
telephone network for all schools will be-
gin in spring 2010. Costs were managed
to include an upgrade of all existing
VOIP phones and licenses within the
current budget.
16. The schools increased Internet connec-
tivity redundancy by installing second
firewall.
17. The Office of Technology is working
with librarians to implement an open

The remainder of the 2009 -2010 school year
will be consumed with three major technology
projects: VOIP telephone installation for
remaining schools and administration buildings,
student information system conversion and roll
out, and wireless network upgrades for remain-
ing schools.

TITLE I
Title I  is a federally funded program that
provides financial resources to districts and
schools with a high rate of students from low -
income families. All six of our Title I schools
Barbieri, Brophy, McCarthy and Woodrow
Wilson Elementary Schools; Cameron and
Fuller Middle Schools —have " schoolwide
programs."This means that all students in the
school are eligible to receive support through
the Title I program.
The Title I grant is used to support struggling
students in literacy and math. At the elementary
level, there are 18 staff members who provide
individual and small -group 
instruction in
literacy and mathematics. At the middle school
level, there are two math specialists who serve
two functions—remedial support to small
groups of students and coaching for the other
math teachers in the school. All of these staff
members meet the federal requirement of
highly qualified,"with most of them holding
teaching certifications.
This year, Framingham qualified for additional
Title I funding through the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).This money
was used to sustain some positions that other-
wise would have been cut, as well as hire two
elementary math coaches. These coaches will
work for two years —the timeframe ofARRA
to support teachers as they implement the new
Think Math! program in grades K -5.
This year, we have shifted the model of support
at the elementary level. We use quantitative and
Education & Libraries 
2009 Annual Report
qualitative achievement data to identify students
who warrant targeted interventions. Teachers
set specific goals for these students, then
monitor progress towards those goals on a
weekly basis.
During the summer of 2009, three schools
participated in professional development
focused on data analysis. After attending the
sessions provided by Nancy Love at Research
for Better Teaching, the 22 "data coaches" are
able to support other teachers in their buildings
as they conduct a more detailed analysis of data
to develop improvement plans for students and
the school as a whole. In early 2010, an online
version of the course will be offered to all
Framingham teachers.
Our Parent Involvement Initiatives have also
shifted, to be aligned with the goals of the Title
Ischools. The Parent Involvement Coordinator
works closely with staff at the schools to
provide support for their parent outreach
activities. This ensures that families receive
consistent and adequate support in their efforts
to help their children succeed in school.
The Title I program continues to be excited
about the support it is able to provide to
students, families, and the general school
community.

Sarah Guernsey, Director of Title I
TRANSPORTATION
The Transportation Department provides a vital
service for the Framingham Public
Schools. Over sixthousand students utilize bus
transportation on a daily basis. The transporta-
tion office continues to work diligently to
ensure our students with safe and efficient
transport. Massachusetts General Law requires
School Departments to provide transportation
to all children within each respective district. To
that end, Framingham provides school trans-
portation to four hundred students in non-
public schools in Framingham. Due to budget
constraints, the School Department moved to a
fee -based transportation program six years ago
111
Page 123
Town of Framingham
for only those students in grades 7 -12. Fees are
waived for special circumstances such as
children placed in Framingham foster care
homes, homeless students, special education
students and students on medical waivers. In
2009, approximately twenty -two hundred
students, of the forty -one hundred plus stu-
dents in grades 7 through 12 purchased bus
passes.

This annual report is submitted by the members
of the School Committee of the South Mid-
dlesex Regional Vocational Technical
School in compliance with the provisions of
the Agreement among the towns of Ashland,
Framingham, Holliston, Hopkinton, and
Natick.
As in recent past reports, this report discusses
from the perspective of the Committee the
principal items with which the Committee was
concerned during the year. It is a representative
account of matters solely within the policy -
making authority of the Committee and also of
matters that the Superintendent /Director
brought before the Committee for information
and consultation. For greater detail and discus-
sion the reader should read the extended
minutes of committee meetings and the attach-
ments thereto which are available at the School
office.
The Committee acknowledges with great
appreciation the service of its Business Man-
ager, Leslie Lesperance. Ms. Lesperance began
her career at the school as a Computer Instruc-
tor in 1977 and earned advancement through a
variety of responsible positions in which she
rendered invaluable support and guidance to a
succession of Superintendents and School
Committees. Ms. Lesperance's retirement
became effective July 31, 2009.
The Committee also noted the retirement of a
number of long term employees including Ms.
Eileen Katz, Cafeteria Worker 25 years; Virginia
Slep, English Teacher, 25 years; Mr. Benton 
Phelps, Information Technology Teacher, 30
years; and Gayle Vigeant, Academic Coordina-
tor, 36 years.
The Committee reorganized on June 1, 2009,
with the following officers being elected
unanimously:
Chair: Nelson Goldin.
Vice - Chair: Tassos Filledes
Secretary: Linda Fobes
Treasurer: Jack Keating
Assistant Treasurer: Lawrence Cooper
Mid -year the Committee welcomed a new
member, Ms Michelle Gates, who is also a
Selectman of the Town of Hopkinton.
The balance of this report presents a summary
of the discussion and actions of the Committee
on a number of the important matters brought
before the Committee for advice or action.
Our 2009 Graduates
Superintendent /Director Jim Lynch reported
on the post -Keefe activities of graduates in the
Class of2009: 40% received acceptance to two -
year colleges; 19% received acceptance to four -
year colleges; 28% secured work related to their
trade; 8% secured work related to their trade;
5% enlisted in the military.
Curriculum Innovations
The Committee approved the designation of its
Small Business Management course as a gradua-
tion requirement for all students beginningwith
the 2009/2010 academic year. This important
course uses computer technology to create
Education & Libraries  112

comprehensive business plans and culminates in
abusiness plan competition. Itis designed tobe
of practical use to students who would like to
apply their career -technical skills to the man-
agement and business operation of their own
small business enterprises.
Under the leadership of Principal Canali the
school initialed a Youth Leadership Program
under the sponsorship of Toastmasters Interna-
tional. The program is advised by Dr. Howard
Rivenson who is a Past District Governor of
Toastmasters District 31 and a lecturer at the
Harvard School of Public Health. The program
is designed to enable high -school teenagers to
better understand and participate in collective
action through the democratic process.
School Finances and Budget:
The Committee reviewed the recommendation
of its budget Sub -committee, under the leader-
ship of Natick representative Dr. Stephen Kane,
and approved a preliminary budget for the
Fiscal Year July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010,
of $15,467, 401,an increase of only 1.01% over
the prior year's budget. This budget was
developed so as to be consistent with the
financial constraints confronting each of our
member districts. The Committee is also
mindful of the high percentage of students who
rely on the free or reduced lunch fee program
and the impact on the educational experience of
those students that would result from charging
fees for athletic participation.
Subsequent savings in the health premium
expense (see Personnel Administration below)
reduced the budget to $15,709.228,
In April the Committee finalized its budget
request to the member communities by further
reducing expenses and by increasing the local
credits by $10,000 received from building
rentals. These changes reduced the amount to
be assessed to member communities in the
2009/2010 budget below the prior year's budget
by one -half of one percent. These reductions
were accomplished despite the non -receipt of
any federal stimulus funds and a reduction by
the state in regional transportation funding, a
key element in the viability of regional school
Education & Libraries 
2009 Annual Report
districts and contrary to the state's policy to
support regionalization.
The District's operating budget for the Fiscal
Year ending June 31, 2010, will be supple-
mented with no additional charges to the
member communities by a combination of
federal and state grants totaling approximately
880,000.
The assessment allocated annually to each
member community is based upon the number
of students enrolled from each town as of
October 1 of the prior year. The enrollment of
indistrict" students as of October 1, 2009,
increased by 22 students over the prior year.
The percentage of students from Framingham
decreased slightly; Natick and the other towns
increased their representation.
The Superintendent /Director and the Principal
made budget presentations to the Finance
Committees of each of the member communi-
ties and received their support for the proposed
budget and assessments at each annual town
meeting.
At the request of the Committee, the Business
Manager and the Superintendent /Director have
developed a  monthly report enabling the
Committee to better track transfers within and
between budget line items that are either within
the discretion of the Superintendent /Director
or require Committee approval.
Upon the expiration of the prior school bus
contract competitive bids were solicited for a
three -year contract. For the first time in recent
years two bids were received. Upon presenta-
tion of the bids to the Committee, some
clarification was required. Both bids were
rejected and the contract rebid. Again two bids
were received, and M.J. Connolly & Sons, Inc.
was awarded the contract on the basis of low
bids on both the three -year base element and
the optional two -year extension.
Other Post Employment Benefits Trust
Fund ( OPEB)
The Committee explored the ways in which it,
and the member communities, is planning to
113
Page 125
Town of Framingham
meet the requirements of the General Account-
ing Standards Board that local governmental
units reflect in their financial statements the
amount of their liability for unfunded post
employment benefits other than pensions. Final
action to create the Trust Fund will await
development and review of a standardized
legislative model. At present, there is no
requirement that governmental bodies appro-
priate money in their operating budgets to begin
to fund that liability.
Community Engagement
The Committee agreed to amend the agreement
with the Town of Framingham relating to the
construction of the sewer pump station at the
side line ofWinter Street. Some additional area
will be added to the easement and the amount
to be paid by the Town for the easement was
set at $5,575, a compromise between the two
appraisals obtained by the Town and the
District, thereby avoiding unnecessary contro-
versy and possible litigation.
The 2008/2009 House Building Project at 264
Elm Street, Framingham provided hands on
experience for Keefe students in the carpentry,
plumbing and electrical shops.
Students in the Health Care Careers and
Culinary Arts vocations received commenda-
tions for assisting the professional staff of the
Framingham Board of Health in conducting its
Heart Forum 2009.
Keefe's unique summer camp operated success-
fully with nearly 500 children from neighboring
communities. The camp, under the direction of
Chris Kane, Keefe's athletic director, combines
a look at a career -oriented education with
opportunities for traditional summer camp
sports. Scholarships were available for students
from Keefe's member communities. Campers
are offered a variety of vocational workshop
experiences in of the sort that they will experi-
ence when they elect Keefe as their high school
of choice.
The Committee, atthe suggestion ofthe Chair,
Nelson Goldin, considered his proposal to
change the name of the school district to
Education & Libraries 
2009 Annual Report
include the term "MetroWest" to better reflect
the area in which the district is located and to
eliminate the reference to " high school"
resulting in a name such as MetroWest Techni-
cal School. This proposal would acknowledge
the possibility of adding two or more years of
further educational opportunity and the award-
ing of Associate degrees in some vocational
programs. Upon the recommendation of the
student body and staff, and upon the persistent
urging of the several sports teams, male and
female, that wear the image and name of
Keefe's long time symbolic mascot, the unicorn,
the Committee approved the adoption of the
name and character "BRONCOS" for use on
uniforms and other appropriate displays.
The Culinary Arts Department provided its
award -winning clam chowder for Framingham's
Miriam McCarthy School's annual Pumpkin
Fair.
Administration
With the enthusiastic support of Superintendent
Lynch, the Committee initiated a new compre-
hensive process for the review and evaluation
of his performance. The new process was
developed jointly by the Superinten-
dent /Director and a Sub -committee consisting
of Dr. Stephen Kane, Ms Linda Fobes, Mr. A.J.
Mulvey and Dr. Esther Hopkins with Mr.
Michael Rossi as chair. The process depends
upon the establishment by mutual consent of
goals for the year with each goal having defined
objectives against which progress can be
measured during the course of the year. The
evaluation also covers specific personal qualities
deemed by the Committee to be important to
successful performance. An interim evaluation
was conducted during the February/ March
with the results being compiled and shared with
the Superintendent /Director, the Committee
members, and the public. The Committee and
the Superintendent/ Director support the
notion that the entire process, including indi-
vidual members' comments and evaluations,
written and oral, should be open and transpar-
ent as required by law. 
114
Page 126
Town of Framingham
Pursuant to the new evaluation procedure, the
Superintendent /Director submitted to the
December meeting a proposal for new goals for
the year 2009 -2010. In recognition of the
desirability of having more complete data on
which to base the performance evaluation itwas
suggested that the goal setting and performance
evaluation cycle be shifted from July 1  to
October 1. The proposed goals were referred to
a reconstituted Superintendent Evaluation Sub -
Committee for review and comment.
School and Student Safety and Security
In January the Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education commended the District
for the progress it has made in correcting all
safety hazards that had been identified during a
safety inspection conducted by the Department
of Labor in March 2008. The commendation
followed a re- inspection on January 22, 2009.
The Committee authorized the application of
available funds to replace the dust collector
apparatus in the Carpentry Shop. The work
project was submitted for competitive bidding
and a contract awarded in the amount of
233,000.
In May the District's security plan encompass-
ing emergency, fire or catastrophic event
planning and procedures was completely
reviewed and revised under the leadership of
Principal Canali. The plan is coordinated with
the departments of the Town of Framingham
responsible for emergency responses and
includes provisions for school crisis response
and security teams. Faculty, staff and students
were informed of their respective responsibili-
ties under the revised plan. Practice drills in
coordination with the Framingham police and
fire departments have been held. Initial ele-
ments of security equipment have been installed
and practice procedures are ongoing.
The Committee at its August meeting consid-
ered a presentation by Robert Edwards of
Framingham relating to the risks and serious
consequences of concussion injuries sustained
in high school sports. He proposed that the
District adopt a sports concussion program that
would require medical approval before students
Education & Libraries 
2009 Annual Report
who had sustained a concussion are permitted
to resume participation in contact sports. The
Committee noted the importance of the subject
and agreed to look further into the matter and
to solicit the comments of the Massachusetts
Interscholastic Athletic Association.
Shortly after the reopening of school there were
reports of adverse skin reactions to several
students using the swimming pool that had
been drained and regrouted as is customary
during the summer months. Upon investigation
and in compliance with the suggestion of the
Framingham Board of Health the pool was
drained, the walls washed and refilled in order
to correct the problem. The pool was reopened
without further incident and with only limited
disruption to the scheduled use of the pool.
Siemens' Energy Conservation Project
The administration and the School Committee's
Energy Sub -committee established a protocol
for regularly monitoring the energy conserva-
tion and cost savings realized by the Siemens'
project. The Committee will receive periodic
certifications that the project continues to meet
its performance and financial guarantees.
Personnel Administration
The Keefe Health Insurance Advisory Commit-
tee reviewed the health insurance options
available through the Massachusetts Interlocal
Insurance Association plan in which Keefe now
participates. Changes to the plan were approved
to take effect on July 1, 2009 and are estimated
to reduce costs for both the employees and the
district. District savings are estimated to be
approximately $ 33,000 at current rates of
enrollment.
The Superintendent /Director established a
Business Manager Search Committee which
included Committee members, Rossi, Fobes
and Knowles. A new job description and list of
duties was created jointly by the Superinten-
dent /Director and the former Business Man-
ager. The position was advertised and posted
with approximately 20 applications being
received. The position was filled on May 11 by
the appointment of Ms. Kirsteen Leveille, who
had served for 13 years in the District Business
115
Page 127
Town of Framingham
Office of Blackstone Valley Vocational Re-
gional School District, a district with 13 mem-
ber towns, 1,100 students and an operating
budget of $18.5 million dollars. Ms. Leveille
began her employment as Business Manager
and Procurement Officer on August 1, 2009.
Continuing Education Program
The District entered its 36` year of offering
night classes to members of the community in a
program of courses that attract approximately
2,500 students each semester. The program,
which is under the direction ofJames Callanan,
Coordinator ofAdult Education, has added
certifications for nursing assistants to meet the
MetroWest area's need for those professions
and has expanded its range of Microsoft
computer certifications in popular business
programs.
Student Achievements
Twenty -eight Keefe Students participated in the
Business Professionals of America (  BPA)
Conferences in March and May 2009. BPA is a
national co- curricular career and technical
organization for high school, middle school and
college students who are preparing for careers
in business and information technology. Eleven
of the students won seventeen competitive
awards in areas that included Network Design,
Administrative Support, Advanced Word
Processing Skills and PC Servicing and Trouble-
shooting.
In April Keefe horticultural and landscaping
students won medals at the Future Farmers of
America State Convention. Medals were
awarded in categories for Environmental
Science and a research project study of the
longhorn beetle.
The Committee reviewed with the Superinten-
dent /Director the 2009 Adequate Yearly
Progress data compiled by the Department of
Elementary & Secondary Education. Determi-
nation of AYP is based on a comparison of the
achievement levels of Keefe students on the
English Language Arts and Mathematics
sections of the MCAS tests at the Grade 10
level for 2008 and 2009. To make Adequate
Education & Libraries 
2009 Annual Report
Yearly Progress in 2009, at least 95% of the
students in a  student sub -group ( such as
Limited English Proficient or Low Income)
must participate and meet either (at the option
of the school) the state's 2009 performance
target for the subject or the sub -group's own
2009 improvement target and meet an atten-
dance or graduation requirement.
The 2009 compilation indicates that although
Keefe students met the participation and
graduation requirements in all student sub-
groups, not all subgroups met the DESE's
improvement requirements based upon the
prior year's performance. In 2008 all sub -groups
had achieved AYP.
The Committee considered at length the likely
reasons for the insufficient AYP and remedial
steps that may be taken. These include recog-
nizing and overcoming deficiencies that can be
identified in students' 8` Grade scores; and
improving students' abilities to read analytically,
to draw inferences from written material, and to
respond to the sort of questions MCAS tests
present. Itwas suggested that the administration
review the MCAS test questions and student
scores to identify the types of questions that
appear to be most troublesome for our students
with a report to be provided at a later date.
Special Education Parent Advisory Council
In May the Committee was visited by four
members of the Special Education Parent
Advisory Council, a state -mandated, school -
wide volunteer organization. This Council
serves as a resource and advisor to parents and
guardians of children with special needs. It also
serves to bring to the attention of the admini-
stration concerns and recommendations for
supporting special needs students.
School Improvement Plan
The Committee reviewed and approved on June
25, 2009, the 2009 -2010 School Improvement
Plan. Under state law the plan originates with
the School Council, which consists of commu-
nity members, parents, students and faculty.
The plan deals with: School Safety, Climate and
Facilities; Curriculum, Instruction and Assess-
ment; Community Partnerships & Communica-
116
Page 128
Town of Framingham
tions; Performance Evaluation; and Profes-
sional Development. Overall, the plan estab-
lishes goals to be achieved during the plan year
in each category and methods of assessing
progress toward those goals. The major themes
of the plan include achieving higher levels of
proficiency in MCAS results; expanding pro-
grams to promote a more positive image of the
school and its advantages; increasing use of data
to assess effectiveness of existing methods,
programs and practices; and providing addi-
tional professional development opportunities
for faculty and staff.

Improvements to facilities, advancements in
technology, introduction of timely program-
ming, securing of grants and significant accom-
plishments of our Long -Range Plan objectives
highlighted a very successful 2009 at the
Framingham Public Library.
The library was again fortunate to realize several
important budgetary advances at the 2009
Annual Town Meeting, which provided re-
sources to address ongoing facility and technol-
ogy challenges. Although the fiscal storm clouds
that gathered over Framingham (and communi-
ties across the state and nation) in 2008 contin-
ued into 2009, the essential work of the library
continued to progress. Library trustees, staff,
and patrons remain appreciative of the strong
support received from Town Meeting Mem-
bers, the Standing Committee on Education,
the Finance Committee, the Capital Planning
Committee andtheBoard ofSelectmen. We
are especially appreciative of the efforts under-
taken by the Town Manager and the Chief
Financial Officer to ensure that the library
received sufficient municipal funding to be in
compliance with all Massachusetts Board of
Library Commissioners regulations. 
Facility Improvements
Capital improvement projects completed at the
McAuliffe Branch Library included renovation
of the manager's office and the Circulation
workroom. Also undertaken was the installation
of a new energy- efficient boiler and other
components of the HVAC system. New interior
lights were installed throughout the building
with a $37,000 energy saving grant from NStar.
We are appreciative of the assistance we
received from Jim Egan of the Building Services
Department and Capital Projects Manager
Doug Goddard in regards to these important
projects.
Capital planning projects undertaken at the
Main Library included major renovations to the
parking garage facility that included improve-
ments to lighting, additional support columns
and repairs to concrete surfaces. While much
has been accomplished, the garage will require
more repairs in the future if it is remain a safe
resource for library users. Finally, new decora-
tive lights were installed in the lobby cafe
thanks to the generosity of the Friends of the
Library. This area of the library has become a
central gathering place for patrons to meet, talk,

and access wireless Internet or just to enjoy a
cup of coffee.
Technology Improvements
Enhancements to the library's computer
network continued with the collaboration of the
Town's Technology Services Department and
the Minuteman Library Network. The library
added a portable computer classroom in the
Costin Room for hands -on PC -based programs.
The portable classroom also serves as a major
upgrade to Literacy Center computing. We
continued to add more computers, updated
older peripheral hardware, invested in new
networking software, and dramatically increased
the responsiveness of the staff and public
networks by linkingwith the Town's high -speed
Fiber Network. Patrons have benefited from
additional computers connected to the Internet
and new computers designated for word
processing projects such as resume writing. The
Town Disability Commission generously
provided the funding for the purchase of an
accessible PC with special hardware and
software to assist persons with disabilities to
access the Internet. The Comcast Cable Com-
pany provided a free -of- charge television feed
at the Main Library. Wireless printing from the
Internet for patrons was installed at the Main
Library. Public wireless Internet access was
added at the McAuliffe Branch Library.
Grants
The library received several grants in 2009. The
Gates Foundation awarded the library a $13,000
technology grant. This grantwas used to initiate
many of the technological improvements
highlighted earlier in this report. As in previous
years, the Town Cultural Commission awarded
the library grants to support both adult and
children' s programming. The library also
received funds from the Community Develop-
ment Department to support the Literacy
Unlimited program.
Friends of the Library
The Friends of the Framingham Public Library
Association, Inc.,continued its long tradition of
dedication on behalf of the library. The Friends
raised thousands of dollars through monthly
Education & Libraries 
2009 Annual Report
book sales to support collections, programs,
and special projects. The Friends worked
diligently to establish a large ongoing bookstore
located just off the lobby at the Main Library.
This new venture has proven to be very popu-
lar, netting thousands of additional dollars to
support library services. Please consider joining
this special group of library supporters.
Being a Part of the Economic Solution
Recognizing that a great many Framingham
citizens were being adversely impacted by these
difficult economic times, the library took action
to assist persons in developing job- searching
skills. Special programs were offered through-
out the year on resume writing, job interviewing
preparation skills, and accessing on -line em-
ployment resources. We also provided space for
job discussion groups and other networking
programs.
Reaching Out To The Community
Library staff collaborated with many commu-
nity organizations, including the Framingham
Historical Society & Museum, assisting with a
major fundraising endeavor to restore the Old
Edgell Library. We collaborated with the Town -
wide PTO to bring programs focusing on
parenting skills to the community. We joined
the START Framingham Partnership in under-
taking a study of the economic impact Fram-
ingham's cultural institutions have on the local
economy. We hosted two flu clinics staffed by
the Board of Health. Library staff attended
registrations for the Framingham Adult ESL
Program (  FAESL), and provided library
information at tables for a health fair and the
multicultural fair. We regularly attend meetings
of the Framingham Community Partners. We
delivered 1500 copies ofour "Look Here First"
library newsletter to 39 organizations through-
out Framingham.
The library continued to do an outstanding job
of meeting the needs of its patrons. In FY2009,
the total system -wide circulation, including
interlibrary loans was 888,543. A total of
383,742 visits were made to the library this year,
an average of 7,379 visits per week. A typical

CAPITAL BUDGET COMMITTEE
The Capital Budget Committee (CBC) consists
of six Town Meeting Members appointed by
the Town Moderator, and one representative
from the Finance Committee. The role ofthe
CBC is to recommend to Town Meeting for
approval all capital projects with a cost of at
least $25,000 and an expected useful life of five
years. 
This year at the Annual Town Meeting, the
CBC recommended for approval General Fund
projects amounting to $6,100. 805, The source
of funding for virtually all of these General
Fund projects was from bonding. The re-
quested projects included the following depart-
ments: Fire, Library, Building Services /Capital
Projects, Parks and Recreation, Police, Public
Works, Highway, Sanitation, Schools and Tech
Services.
In addition the CBC recommended to Town
Meeting Enterprise Funds projects totaling
96,050. 307, The projects were as follows:
Water Enterprise Fund $46,200961,and Sewer
Enterprise Fund $49,850. 345, The sources of
funding were from bonding. A substantial
portion of the bonding projects will be at
interest rates of 2% or less. In addition, the
Town is hopeful that some stimulus funding
will be received from the Federal Government.
Included in the two Enterprise Funds were
40,900337,for the ongoing Birch Road Well
Project and $40,100407,for the East Framing-
ham Sewer Project.
It was a very challenging year for the CBC. The
Committee made some very difficult decisions
due to limited Town funds and a never -ending
list of capital projects requested by the various
Town departments /divisions. The Committee
plays a very critical role in the long -term future
of the Town's infrastructure. We will continue
to work closelywith the Chief Financial Officer
in order to make recommendations of projects
that benefit our Town, while maintaining fiscal
responsibility.

DISABILITY COMMISSION
Members: Karen Foran Dempsey ( Chair),
Thelma Berman ( Vice Chair),Rose Quinn
Treasurer), Elise Marcil (  Clerk), Kathie
McCarthy, Deb Freed, Dennis Moran.
The Disability Commission accomplished much
in 2009. Much of our work is done by our Sub -
Committees, some of which are: Access Issues,
Legislation and Public Education and Aware-
ness.
In July the MetroWest Regional Transit Author-
ity (MWRTA) began the MetroWest RIDE
assuming the para transit service from the
MBTA. Commissioners were instrumental in
assisting the MWRTA as members of the Ride
Task Force. Initially the service had start -up
issues in the area of communications and with
transfer trips to Boston. Both the MWRTA's
Call Center and the RIDE service itself have
improved since then and there are few com-
plaints.
When the MWRTA instituted a change in
service hours for new riders versus grand -
fathered riders, the commission wrote a letter to
the BoS stating our opposition. The BoS in
September voted to support our letter. We will
continue to be involved and work on this issue.
The commission, through its participation in
the ADA Transition Plan Sub -committee,
continues to work with the town to improve
ADA- mandated access to town -owned build-
ings. Recently a new lift was installed outside
the Ablondi Room. There have been some
problems with the new lift but we continue to
work with Jim Egan of Building Services to
rectify the problems.
One issue the Access Issues Sub -committee is
dealing with is handicapped access to the main
entrance of the Village Hall. The BoS agreed to
our request to have a feasibility study conducted
by an outside architectural firm that specializes
in accessibility of historical buildings. 
121
Page 133
Town of Framingham
In October the commission hosted a training
with the Massachusetts Architectural Access
Board on its Rules and Regulations (521 CMR).
The training, attended by many town employ-
ees, will aid in the town's compliance with state
regulations for accessibility.
The handicapped parking fine monies have
been approved for assistive listening devices for
the Callahan Senior Center, JAWS Screen
Reader for the library and a fully accessible
playground for Parks &  Recreation Depart-
ment. The total amount voted was $37,395.
We would like to thank all the town depart-
ments, the Selectman's Office and Town
Meeting members for their continued support
of our programs and activities. We look forward
to continuing to work with the town on these as
well as other issues to ensure that the town is in
compliance with State and Federal disability
laws.
We also want to thank Tim Goddard, the
former Assistant Town Manager /ADA Coordi-
nator. Mr. Goddard was wonderful to work
with and very aware of our issues and needs.
Also thank you to Scott Morelli, who was also
very helpful to the commission. They will be
greatly missed.
Lastly we want to extend a special thank you to
Dennis Polselli, who resigned from the Com-
mission in April 2009. Mr. Polselli served as the
Chair of the Commission since its inception in
2003. He is greatly missed by all of the commis-
sioners as well as by the town.

FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Finance Committee consists of nine
members appointed by the Town Moderator
for a term of three years. The Finance Commit-
tee recommends action to Town Meeting
regarding the budget and other areas of finance.
Other key responsibilities include authorizing
disbursements from the Reserve Fund for
emergency expenses, authorizing deficit spend-
General Committees 
2009 Annual Report
ing for emergency winter -related expenses,
approving the expenditure ceiling for revolving
funds and monitoring the Town's annual audit.
Members serve on the Real Property and
Capital Budget Committees and other forums
of a financial nature.
This report is based on a calendar rather that
town fiscal year. The period was unprecedented
in the unpredictability of state and federal
government revenue sources and there were
losses all around. Thus closing the gap between
revenue and expense was a deliberation of
brinkmanship and negotiation down to the
floor of the Annual Town Meeting. During this
process, it became glaringly obvious that the
structural reform of our local government of
which the Finance Committee had spoken for
the prior three years should have taken place
and now must take place. The question was
how to get there. The Finance Committee met
31 times during the year and participated in the
Annual and three Special Town Meetings to
address these challenges.
The process to structure FY 2010 budget
recommendations was preceded by intense
focus on FY 2009 School Department budget
performance, monitoring accounts, and explor-
ing financial activities and systems. Frank
conversations about potential structural revi-
sions between the schools and Town and within
the schools gave evidence to the mutual con-
cern that every effort should be taken to
minimize cost without disruption of service.
The review process for the FY 2010 operating
budget requested each department to present an
overview of the mission and goals, organ .Zation,
scope ofwork, comparison with other towns, revenues,
and requested budget of their department. This
provided a comprehensive view of all Town
services as well as an appreciation for the
efforts that had been undertaken to stabilize
services in a time that required fiscal constraint.
In that same context the committee discussed
key long term financial issues: 1) Increasing
revenues through economic development, one 
122
Page 134
Town of Framingham
time state and federal funding, meals and
lodging tax, ongoing Cherry Sheet bottom line;
2) Streamlining Town Policy on Litigation to
assure efficient oversight; 3) Building reserves
to address unfunded liabilities ( Stabilization
Fund, Pension Fund, OPEB- Retiree Health
Insurance);4) Monitoring the Town audit; and
5) Identifying potential solutions to the Town
structural deficit.
In its wisdom, the Town Meeting accepted
recommendations to adopt the meals and
lodging tax for placement in the Stabilization
Fund as well as provisions of MGL that permit
consolidation of Town and school administra-
tive functions. With the assistance of ARRA
funding, the School Department budget gap
was closed with the hope that the same funds
would be available for the FY 2011 budget.
However, one of the paramount budgetary
structural deficits remains; Town leadership
must find a way to address the enormous
disparity between school and non -school
salaries and wages, and in closing that gap,
demonstrate that we are one municipality, not
two component parts with separate power
bases.
There were no reserve fund transfers in calen-
dar year 2009. Per provisions of MGL, the
Finance Committee did authorize a snow and
ice deficit that grew to $1,000370, and was
rectified in the Fall Special Town Meeting.
The Audit Sub -committee, consisting of three
Finance Committee members, met with the
Town's outside audit firm as well as members
of the Chief Financial Officer's staff and the
school Business Department throughout the
year to further progress on the ongoing mission
to establish an internal control program and to
dispose of audit findings. Individual roles and
responsibilities were defined to write policies
and procedures and to initiate self -audits for the
areas that the audit report cited as in need of
correction. The schools made significant
progress in launching their controls program to
address in particular activity funds, receipts, and
time and effort records.

GOVERNMENT STUDY COMMITTEE
The Government Study Committee, after a
period of inactivity, has been revitalized with
the appointment of new members and the
election of new officers. The committee's Rules
and Procedures have been updated to change
attendance and meeting quorum requirements.
It is hoped that this will improve participation
in our meetings and activities.
In preparation for fall Town Meeting the
committee evaluated and voted on three
warrant articles. These were two that related to
the dates for scheduling of spring and fall town
meeting and one that changed the town clerk's
attendance reporting requirements for town
meeting members running for reelection. The
vote results were reported to town meeting
during the deliberations of the articles.
In November, the Committee hosted a public
presentation about possible changes to town
government. Our speakers were the town
managers from Franklin and Lowell. They
discussed the change from town meeting to
councilmen with town /city manager forms of
government. A lively interchange of ideas
followed the presentations.
There are a number of issues currently affecting
town government under discussion by the
Government Study Committee. We plan to take 
123

an active role in advising Town Meeting and the
Board of Selectman on these issues. The
committee meetings are open to all. We wel-

GREENER FRAMINGHAM
COMMITTEE
The Greener Framingham Committee has been
charged with the task of investigating our
municipal energy costs and consumption and
finding ways to reduce both. We have collected
four years' worth of energy data to establish
energy benchmarks and taken thermal imaging
pictures to measure heat loss. We have studied
the Stretch Building Code as well as LEED
building standards and we are considering ways
to encourage the Town to adopt these princi-
ples in both new building construction and
current building renovations. While it is clear
that many our buildings have made improve-
ments over time, several—including the Memo-
rial Building —are in  need of major
improvements to conserve energy. Lighting
upgrades, motion sensors, and digital controls
would go a long way towards meeting the
Town's energy goals.
However, until those investments in conserva-
tion technology are made, one of the greatest
sources of energy waste remains the human
factor. It has been our repeated observation
that the Town's current energy policy, adopted
by the Board of Selectmen in 2007, has not
been effectively enforced. Lights, computers,
and other appliances are frequently left on when
municipalemployeesarenotusingthem. This
needs to change. Itwas disappointing that the
Town of Framingham failed to apply to be
considered for the Green Communities pro-
gram run by the Commonwealth, however we
do hope the Town will take advantage of other
opportunities offered by state and federal
governments.

HISTORICAL COMMISSION
The Framingham Historical Commission's main
effort in 2009, as in years past, was to review
demolition applications.
Researching the history of each structure and
carefully reviewing any architectural or cultural
significance help us render decisions that are in
keeping with the Town's Demolition Delay By-
law and in the best interests of the town's
inhabitants.
In 2009, the commission nearly completed the
town -wide review of all buildings in order to
update our Cultural Resources Inventory. We
will finish this task in early 2010.
Looking forward to the years ahead, the FHC
began the process of reviewing the Demolition
Delay By -law to plan ways to update it to better
serve its original purpose.

HISTORIC DISTRICT COMMISSION
In 2009 the Framingham Historic District
Commission reviewed applications for work in
the districts including projects done by the town
to the Jonathan Maynard School (now School
administration),  The Framingham History
Center (windows) and various signs in the
districts. The HDC voted to begin the process
of extending the historic district up to Route 9
and over to the residential neighborhood
adjacent to Framingham State College, and we
worked with the town's administration on the
long -term care of the Centre Common, includ-
ing handicapped access to the Village Hall, as
well as reviewing the sewer work proposed by
the DPW in the district along Auburn Street, a
street designated as a scenic way.

TECHNOLOGY ADVISORY
COMMITTEE
2009 was a challenging year for the Technology
Advisory Committee (TAC).The TAC has a
growing concern that the town's Technology
Director position has been vacant for 2 years
now. In our personal and business lives we all
know that technology, well applied, can increase
efficiency and decrease costs. Framingham is
saving money in salary by leaving this position
vacant, but we fear that continued delay in
filling this role will ultimately end up costing the
town more money. We would note thatwe
respect and admire the work of the acting
Assistant Director ofTechnology, Carly Melo
Premo, and appreciate Carly's continuing to
maintain a partnership with the TAC. However,
filling the town's Technology Director role
needs to be a priority in early 2010.
In contrast, the School Superintendent's
decision to hire Adam Seldow as Technology
Director last year has yielded solid benefits for
the schools. Adam Seldow and his team have
implemented server optimization, upgraded
core and wireless networking, and replaced
aging phone systems, to name a few. The TAC
has been pleased to build a partnership with
General Committees 
2009 Annual Report
Adam, consulting and advising as needed on
various technology decisions. We look forward
to this continued partnership with the schools'
technology department.
In keeping with its charter, the TAC reviewed
the capital budget in 2009 and advised on
capital technology purchases and initiatives.

Framingham's Annual Town Meeting began on
April 28 and met 13 times to consider 48
articles consisting of administrative, fiscal,
policy and zoning articles. The fiscal 2010
operating budget saw the most discussion as
Town Meeting approved a final operating
budget of $196,633601,for the year that began
on July 1, 2009.
Town Meeting also met on three separate
occasions for Special Town Meetings on April
30 ( one time),October 27 ( four times) and
January 26, 2010 (one time).These three special
meetings had a total of 38 warrant articles for
consideration, with the October fall meeting
having a warrant of 34 articles.
Town Meeting members this year totaled 180 of
an authorized amount of 216, 12 each from 18
precincts. Vacancies were in precincts 2 (1),3
1),5 (1),7 (1),9 (3), 10 (1), 11 (1), 13 (2) 14 (4),
15 ( 3),16 ( 5),17 ( 8),and 18 ( 5).At every
meeting, Town Meeting members listened
carefully and thoughtfully discussed, debated
and voted on each article presented for their
consideration.
Town Meetings are the result of the efforts of
many different people. A special thank you goes
to the Town Clerk and her staff; the Board of
Selectmen; the Town Manager and his staff,
especially the Building Services Manager and his
staff; Town Counsel; and Media Services. Town
Meeting could not happen without their help.
Also, many hours are spent by the seven Town
Meeting Standing Committees and the Modem -
tor- appointed committees (  Capital Budget,
Finance, Government Study, Real Property,
Technology Advisory and the Personnel Board)
discussing and developing articles to be pre-
sented to the Board of Selectmen for the 
warrants. All of these committees and boards
are to be highly complimented for their time
and dedication.
Finally, a debt of gratitude is owed to each town
meeting member for sharing their time and
talent by volunteering to be Town Meeting
members. Their dedication makes Framing -
ham's government function and is very much
appreciated.

Driscoll, Vice Chair and the liaison to Human
Relations, and Rita Blum, the liaison to the
Council on Aging. The Chair recognizes them
for their continued commitment and participa-
tion.
The committee met twice in 2009. Among the
issues put before or addressed by the SCCS
were the following.
The committee unanimously supported Articles
Town Meeting  127
Page 139
Town of Framingham
11 and 12 submitted by the Community Devel-
opment Block Grant Committee in the Warrant
for the Annual Town Meeting in April.
The committee has monitored the Bowditch
Field construction project. At this writing the
demolition of the old stadium and the construc-
tion of the new maintenance sheds next to the
Loring Arena have been completed. The
stadium construction portion of the projectwill
hopefully be completed in time for the fall 2010
high school football season.
The condition of the Main Street Burial Ground
was brought to the committee's attention by the
Chair. The deterioration of the headstones,
monuments, and markers is quite advanced as
might be expected in a graveyard dating back to
before the Revolution. The graveyard may need
preservation care over and above the profes-
sional maintenance already being provided. The
Chair intends to approach Parks and pertinent
Town committees in 2010 to inquire if anything
more can be done to preserve the Town
cemeteries.
A housekeeping issue of note that was dealt
with by the committee was lack of availability of
its past minutes. The library and the Town
Clerk's office presently have no copies of any
meeting minutes before April 27, 2009. The
committee is now submitting its meeting
minutes electronically. Due to the above issue,
the upcoming changes to the Commonwealth's
open meeting law and the possible need of this
Committee to comply with same, a liaison has
been appointed to consult with the Rules
Committee.
In a final note, the Chair wishes to thank at this
time his predecessors, Dave Hutchinson and
Dawn Harkness, both ofwhom he served with
as a committee member and as the Vice Chair-
man respectively, for their service to this
committee. The Chair and committee will look
to meet the challenges assigned to them in 2010
with the same good spirit and vigor that was
displayed during their tenures.
Respectfully submitted,
John R. Dwyer, Chairman
Town Meeting 
2009 Annual Report
STANDING COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION
The Standing Committee on Education con-
cerns itself with the activities, budgets, and
related warrant articles pertaining to Framing-
ham Public Schools, Joseph P. Keefe Regional
Technical School and the Framingham Public
Library system. The committee met with key
personnel from each of these organizations to
review their operational and capital requests
prior to the 2009 annual Town Meeting.
Also during 2009, the committee sought to
clarify their charge for the future, considering
the current fiscal oversight provided by both
the Finance and Ways and Means Committees.
It was agreed that a broader and longer -term
view of each organization, including operational
and functional analyses, would be undertaken
for report at future Town Meetings.
Respectfully submitted,
Melanie Goddard, Chair
STANDING COMMITTEE ON PLANNING &
ZONING
Our committee met monthly (except in July and
August) during this past year. For Annual Town
Meeting, we met with individual applicants,
members of the Planning Board, and Alison
Steinfeld of Community and Economic Devel-
opment to discuss in detail and vote on eight
proposed zoning change Articles. For Special
Town Meeting this fall, we met with members
from the Planning Board and Board of Select-
men to discuss at length and vote on six
proposed sign by -law change Articles.
We have also worked on, and are submitting to
Annual Town Meeting, proposed changes to
the current kennel provisions in Section IV.E.
of the Zoning By -law. This work came about at
the request of residents in neighborhoods.
We continue to study and discuss the ongoing
efforts of the State to pre -empt local zoning
control. Specifically, these legislative efforts are
manifested in the Land Use Partnership Act
LUPA) and the Comprehensive Siting Reform
for Land Based Wind Projects. These proposed
128
Page 140
Town of Framingham
State mandates have the potential to greatly
impair local zoning options with as yet unveri-
fied economic return.
Respectfully submitted,
Judy Callahan, Chair
STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC
SAFETY
On behalf of the Standing Committee on Public
Safety, I am honored to present this annual
report. This past year has focused on rebuilding
and re- energizing. Time seemed to slip by and
relationships with town departments were
strained, which we are working hard to re-
build. In addition to the departments that fall
under the purview of this committee (Police,
Fire and Building Services),the committee has
started a  process 
of reaching out
to other boards and commissions. That process
has resulted in an agreement between this
committee and the Traffic Safety and Roadway
Committee that we will keep each other in-
formed of the topics being covered and provide
a means of information and knowledge transfer.
As this process continues, it is our hope to
reach similar agreements with other boards and
commissions.
Respectfully submitted,
Ken Schwartz, Chair, SCPS
TMM Pct 2 Chair
STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORDS
The Standing Committee on Public Works is
making steady progress towards recovering
potentially large sums of monies owed to
Framingham by major out -of -town sewer
customers, thanks to a very active committee
and the cooperation of the Town's Chief
Financial Officer.
Reports to Town Meeting have been very well
received, and the SCPW has been encouraged
to bring the bacon home at a time when the
Town is facing a financial crisis. Success will see
money returned not only to the Enterprise
Fund (EF) but also to the General Fund to pay
taxpayers back for funds invested before the EF
was created.
Town Meeting 
2009 Annual Report

STANDING COMMITTEE ON RULES
A major objective of the Standing Committee
on Rules is to work with the Town Moderator,
other officials, and various committees to create
more efficient Town Meetings through proce-
dures involving implementation of rules,
policies, and bylaws. Timely distribution of
background educational packets on warrant
articles and related topics is a committee
objective. The handouts on the tables at Town
Hall are managed by Bernice Strom.
In addition, updating the " Town Meeting
Member's Handbook" is an ongoing Rules
Committee objective, with a new issue sched-
uled for release in spring 2010. We thank our
Vice -Chair, Amy Weader, who has dedicated
tedious hours to updating the handbook, and
Walter Adamski, whose new and revised
guidelines (Appendices 3 and 4 of the hand-
book) will make a significant contribution to
any persons who present warrant articles and
use Power Point for reports or presentations at
Town Meeting.
In cooperation with the Town Clerk, the Rules
Committee supported two articles that passed at
the October 2009 Town Meeting. One requires
attendance records of Town Meeting members
running for election, and the other alters the
129
Page 141
Town of Framingham
Fall Town Meeting start date to the third
Tuesday in October. In addition, a resolution
sponsored by Joel Winett and unanimously
approved by Town Meeting reminds those who
place material on the information tables that an
identifying article number must be displayed at
the upper right -hand corner ofthe first page of
each informational sheet or packet, along with
the date and name of the provider.
In calendar year 2009, our Rules Committee
achieved significant progress in its endeavor to
provide electronic voting at future Town
Meetings. Joel Winett, Walter Adamski, and Ed
Kross met with Town administrators, boards,
and committees to discuss the electronic voting
endeavor and to provide cost analyses, proce-
dures, policies, and data sheets. They also
obtained keypads, a receiver, and software to
run a demo of electronic voting. In summary,
when our committee's goal of electronic voting
is realized, this new technology, at minimal
expense, will streamline Town Meeting sessions
by providing a faster, more efficient voting
process, along with reducing the Town Clerk's
work recording Town Meeting members' votes.
We thank all of our Rules Committee members
for their dedication, commitment, and contribu-
tions toward creating a more effective Town
Meeting process.
Respectfully submitted,
Gloria Geller, Chair
STANDING COMMITTEE ON WAYS &
MEANS
As defined in the Town by -laws, the Standing
Committee on Ways and Means (SCW &M) is
responsible for making recommendations to
Town Meeting on warrant articles sponsored by
and /or related to the Finance Committee
FinCom),the Finance, Human Resources and
Information Services Divisions, the Board of
Selectmen ( BOS),the Town Clerk, Town
Elections, the Legal Department, the Retire-
ment Board and the Capital Budget and Gov-
ernment Study Committees. 
2009 Annual Report
One Town Meeting member from each precinct
is eligible to be elected to the SCW &M. In the
process of reviewing the warrant articles, the
SCW &M meets with involved parties and
representatives of town departments, boards,
committees, and commissions. In 2009 there
were two special Town Meetings and the annual
Town Meeting.
The SCW &M has earned a superb reputation
for conducting credible, thorough analyses and
composing comprehensive, fact -based reports
and recommendations to assist Town Meeting
members evaluate warrant articles.
The committee reviewed and reported on 55%
of the articles that came before Town Meeting,
in addition to performing detailed reviews of
components of the annual operating, school
and capital budgets. One major challenge the
committee faced in doing its work was the lack
of information made available prior to Town
Meeting. This was especially difficult when
backup material and /or motions were not
prepared prior to their introduction on Town
Meeting floor. Because of this, the SCWM
recommended that Town Meeting table an
article regarding a request for an additional
appropriation for legal funds for the Nexum
lawsuit. Town meeting heeded that recommen-
dation and many members, including other
standing committee chairs spoke about the
difficulty of doing their work without informa-
tion being made available to the committees in a
timelier manner. Since that time, and one review
meeting later (which included representation
from The Standing Committee on Ways and
Means, The Government Study Committee,
The Finance Committee and The Standing
Committee on Public Works),specific recom-
mendations to improve the process were made
tothe Moderator. The Moderator has since
collaborated with town officials to implement
the recommendations and make the Town
Meeting due diligence process more productive.
We look forward to seeing the benefits of those
actions at the annual 2010 Town Meeting.
