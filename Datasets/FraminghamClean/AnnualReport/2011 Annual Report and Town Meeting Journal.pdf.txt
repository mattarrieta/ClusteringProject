Annual Report
Year Ending December 31, 2011
Framingham's Town Seal: In the year 1900, the Framingham Town Seal was redesigned
for the Town's bicentennial to recognize our community's prominence in education and
transportation. The Framingham State Normal School, a free public school and the first of
its kind in America, is represented by the structure at the top of the design. Governor
Danforth, the founder of Framingham and owner of much of its land, is acknowledged by
the words "Danforth's Farms 1662" on the shield at the center. The wheel on the shield
with spokes drawn as tracks radiating in six different directions represents the steam and
electric railroads and signifies the Town's position as atransportation hub. Surrounding the
words "Town of Framingham Incorporated 1700" is an illustrative border of straw braid,
which honors the prominent role Framingham played in the manufacture of hats and
bonnets in the 1800s.

Dedication
September 11, 2011 marked the 10' anniversary of the 9/11
terrorist attacks against the United States ofAmerica. While many
lives were lost that day, the Town of Framingham would like to
dedicate the 2011 Annual Town Report to the 17 residents of
Framingham who had their lives cut short on that fateful morning
10 years ago.

a..
In 2011, the Town of Framingham
experienced many highs and lows, the
community suffered tragedy and triumph, and
through it all, the residents, businesses and
municipal employees persevered.
During a SWAT Team drug raid in January,
an officer'sfirearm accidently fired. Eurie
Stamps, a resident of the Town, was killed as
aresult. This accidentledto manyquestions
and concerns by the community which
triggered the creation of a separate, non-
affiliated investigative committee that was
formed by PoliceChiefStevenCarl. The
committee created a list of ways in which the
Police Department and the Town could avoid
incidents like this in the future and developed
a plan to help heal the community. This
report was given to the Board as well as a
largecontingency of the community. This
tragedy has turned into an opportunity to
unite the community and work towards
healing the wounds created by this incident.
The Board has coordinated with the
Framingham Coalition in the organization of
community meetings that will be held in
several neighborhoods to work on unifying
General Government 
the community and overcoming this tragedy
as a community.
During the early months of 2011,
Framingham experienced many winter storms
that caused a great deal of snow and ice build-
up. The removal ofthis snow and treatment
of icy roads caused a financial burden for the
Town as well as a strain on DPW resources.
We would like to thank the DPW for their
hard work during these storms and continued
dedication to the Town of Framingham by
keeping our roads clear and safe for school
buses and residents.
2011 also saw many infrastructure
improvements within the Town including a
massive water /sewer line replacement project
commissioned by the Department of Public
Works. Mass DOT also shared in this
endeavor as much needed repairs were made
to the Fountain Street Bridge and discussions
were begun regarding potential repairs to
other bridges within the Town during the
upcoming year. While these projects will
greatly benefit the Town of Framingham they
arenotwithout headache. Muchconcern and
aggravation has been created as a result of
these projects and we would like to thank the
residents of the Town who are impacted on a
daily basis for their continued patience and
understanding during the construction season.
The board continued to work on creating
good will between the Schools and Town
Departments as well as an agreed upon
budget by all departments and the School
Committee. This budget allowed
Framingham to continue to invest in our
TownandourSchools. Theboardwillwork
to continue this era of good will between the
groups and we are looking forward to
1
Page 14
Town of Framingham
working along with the School Committee in
the future.
Framingham also experienced a change in
leadership as Town Manager Julian Suso's
tenure came to an end on October 31 ".  His
departure created a large vacancy that was
filled byTown ClerkValerieMulvey. Valerie
stepped up, like she did in 2006, and agreed to
become the Interim Town Manager in
October. Valeriehas helped move the Town
forward once again as she did in 2006, Valerie
has done a great job during her interim
position and the Board would like to thank
her for her dedication to the Town of
Framingham.
The Board of Selectmen recently responded
to the complex and multidimensional
tax /assessment issue with a 6 point plan to
address this issue and in particular, the
questions raised by Board members and the
public at large. First and foremost our plan
prioritizes the need for an objective and
thorough review of the Town's assessing
process and specific recommendations for
improvement or alteration, based upon the
results determined. This plan also includes
steps to consider available options for short as
well as long term solutions for residential
property tax relief. We need to stay focused
on this plan and not get derailed. It is our
hope that we can all work together —in a
respectful and cooperative manner. The
Board began working with the FDIC,
Community and Economic Development,
Planning Board and the Town Manager's
office on creating new ways to revitalize not
only the downtown but all of Framingham's
commercial districts and will continue to do
so in the up- coming year.
Through 2011, the Board and SMOC worked
towards creating a new working relationship.
This began with the appointment of Joan
Rastani to the SMOC Board of Directors as
the Framingham representative. We believe
Joan will bring fresh ideas and leadership to
the SMOC Board and represent Framingham
in a manner we may all be proud of.
General Government 
2011 Annual Town Report
A major project commissioned by the Board
during 2011 was the revitalization of the
Nobscot Shopping Plaza. TheBoardhas
hosted a number of public meetings with
residents and business owners of the Nobscot
property and asked for their feedback in what
they would like to see in their community and
neighborhood. Mt. Wayte Shopping Plaza is a
high priority as well and the Board hopes to
create a working plan with the management
group of this facility as well during 2012.
At the Annual Town Meeting in April an
article sponsored by the Board of Selectmen
creating the first Sex offender by -law within
Framingham was passed and sent to the
Attorney General for certification. The
Attorney General notified the Town on
December 20` that this by -law had been
certified and was 
able to gointoeffect. A
great amount of debate took place on Town
Meeting floor regarding this by -law and the
Board would like to thank Town Meeting
Members for their input and ultimate passing
ofthisarticle. This by -law will protect our
residents against sex offenders and give the
Police Department greater capability in
protecting all residents of Framingham and
continuing to keep our streets safe.
In 2011, the State passed the Municipal
Health Care Reform Law which allowed the
Town to negotiate new health care plans with
all union and non -union employees. This has
allowed Framingham to experience savings in
year one estimated at $1.7 Million and will
lower the base $2.4 Million in subsequence
years. TheBoardwould liketothankTown
Counsel Chris Petrini and his staff, CFO Mary
Ellen Kelley, Former Town Manager Julian
Suso and Assistant Town Manager David
Williams for their efforts in obtaining these
savings for the Town of Framingham.
Last but not least, the Board of Selectmen
would like to thank the many individuals
within the Town who work tirelessly to move
Framingham forward and create a  better
community for tomorrow that we all may be
proud to reside in. We would like to thank all

It is my pleasure to present this Report for
calendar year 2011. Be advised that this
Report is intended as a brief summary only.
More comprehensive, detailed information on
all town activities is available elsewhere in this
Annual Town Report.
During the past year the Town has:
Hosted meetings with our major corporations
to maintain and promote a strong working
relationship with our largest employers;
Continued Town participation on the Tech
Park Advisory Group;
Initiated an ongoing dialogue with the School
Superintendent and the new president of
MassBay Community College to identify and
reconcile the needs of both MassBay and the
School Department for use of Framingham
School buildings;
Worked with MassDOT to encourage
stabilization of the Rugg Gates properties and
transfer ownership to the Town;
Participated in working groups to identify
approaches to protect Eastleigh Farm from
development;
Coordinated Town's efforts to successfully
protect a $4.5 million federal earmark for
downtown improvements and to encourage
the State to continue to address the
General Government 
2011 Annual Town Report
Framingham for your trust and loyalty to the
Town of Framingham and for giving us the
honor of representing you on the Board of
Selectmen.
Respectfully submitted,
Jason Smith, Chairman
Board of Selectmen
overarching issue of the downtown rail
crossings.
The Town Manager's Office was also
involved throughout the year with
negotiations on all collective bargaining
contracts, which includes employee health
insurance negotiations with the Public
Employee's Committee (PEC).A cooperative
effort resulted in an agreement that will save
taxpayers millions of dollars in the coming
years, with a projected savings of $1.4 million
savings through Fiscal Year 2013.
In 2011, two other major, multi -departmental
initiatives were implemented with the
involvement of the Town Manager's Office
andBoard ofSelectmen. One initiative
involved working with the School
Department to privatize the School
Transportation function. The other initiative
was a change in the Town's property and
liability insurance carrier. These two efforts
saved the taxpayers approximately $2 million
in the first year of implementation.
Thank you to the Board of Selectmen for
their leadership and support during 2011. I
strongly commend my colleagues, the
Division and Department Heads comprising
Framingham's excellent administrative team,
for their extraordinary commitment and
collaborative spirit in providing high quality
local government services to our taxpayers
during a continuing time of considerable fiscal
distress. I thank Town Meeting forits

communication, engagement and budget
support for the many Town services which we
are so privileged to deliver to fellow residents
ofthe Town ofFramingham. I thank former
Town Manager, Julian Suso, for his efforts on
behalf of the Town during his tenure from
June 2006 through October 2011.Thank you to Assistant Town Clerk Lisa
Ferguson, Election Coordinator Lauren
DiGiandomenico, and Administrators Emily
Black and Elena Finehouse for maintaining
the operation of the Town Clerk's Office
during my absence as they continued to
provide excellent public service despite being
short -staffed for an unexpected, extended
period of time.
Is
The Framingham Town Clerk's office is
the largest joint clerk /election operation
inMassachusetts. Wearealsooneofthe
busiest Clerk's offices in the state. The
presence of a birthing hospital, numerous
nursing homes and assisted living facilities
and a population of over 68,000 residents
contribute to the substantial work load.
Assistant Town Clerk Lisa Ferguson
manages our daily operations and instructs
and supervises staff. Lisa directed the
Town Clerk and Elections Departments in
November and December while I served
as Interim Town Manager at the request
of the Board of Selectmen.
The Town Clerk Department is
responsible for creating and preserving
the Town's vital records. The two
administrators are Emily Black and Elena
Finehouse. Their primary responsibilities
are customer service and processing vital
records. In 2011, we registered and issued
953 birth certificates, 670 death
certificates, 466 marriage licenses, 3565
dog licenses and 605 business certificates.
Other responsibilities include: processing

I am especially grateful to Thomas Begin,
Cherry Manuel and Maryellen Rupp for their
invaluable assistance to me during this time of
transition. They arethewelcoming faces of
the Selectmen /Town Manager's Office. They
treat our public with respect, understanding,
and kindness while providing useful
information or direction in response to any
problem or question posed to them.
I thank Town Counsel Chris Petrini and
Assistant Town Manager, David Williams for
their wisdom, support and guidance during

Town of Framingham
The Annual Town Meeting met over
twelve nights in April and May. Four
Special Town Meetings were held on
January 12th, May 5th, June 21" and
October 18th.
Our population grew from 66,910 to
68,318 as a result of the 2010 Federal
Census. The boundaries ofnine of our
eighteen precincts changed due to
population shifts. All twelve town meeting
seats in each of these nine precincts will
appear on the Town Election ballot in
2012. I am grateful to Geoff Kovar, GIS
specialist for his valuable assistance with
ourre- precincting efforts. DPWDirector
Peter Sellers and Town Engineer Jeremy
Marsette allowed Geoff to assist us in
2011 as they did in 2010. This saved us
considerable time and effort.
The Board of Selectmen, Town Officials
and Town Meeting Members provide
consistent support to this office; it is a
genuine pleasure to work with them and
with all those who participate in our
government. Town employees are always 
2011 Annual Town Report
professional, knowledgeable and willing to
help. We are grateful to Carly Premo Melo
and the Technology Services staff for
automating many of our operations and
Jim Egan and the Building Services staff
for facilitating the Town Election. We are
not charged to use Keefe Tech or St.
Tarcisius Parish Center as polling
locations; nor are we charged for the use
of St. Stephen's parking lot on election
days. Our poll -workers continue to work
long days to ensure that the public is well
served when they vote. Through the
Senior Tax Relief Program, we were
fortunate to have the help of Chet Fenno.
Finally and most importantly I thank and
commend my small, dedicated staff for
their hard work, professionalism and
knowledgeable, friendly attitudes when
dealing with the public. They exemplify
the Town's commitment to excellent
customer service.
Respectfully submitted,

v. Framingham 
TYPE
Contract 
2011/2012 STATUS/DISPOSITION
This case concerns a suit by Boston Properties against the Town to
recover $175,000 in funds from a failed development near Mass
Pike Exit 12. Under a 1999 development covenant executed by
Boston Properties, it agreed to provide $350,000 to the Town
provided that certain contingencies occurred, namely the issuance
ofcertainpermits forthe development. The development failed
and Boston Properties is now seeking this money back, claiming
the contingencies never occurred. The litigation centers around

Framingham 
Wetlands
Corrado v. Town of
Framingham 
Wetlands 
2011 Annual Town Report
whether thecontingencies occurred ordidnotoccur. The Town's
position is that the contingencies occurred based on certain site
preparation and demolition that occurred on the property, as well
as the moving ofthe historic Rugg -Gates House. Presently the
parties are engaged in discovery, which ends in 2012, to likely be
followed by cross -motions for summary judgment by both the
Town and Boston Properties.
This case involved the Conservation Commission's efforts to
enforce wetlands violations committed by William Carney of 32
Parker Road. The Commission found that Mr. Carney had clear
cut numerous trees and dumped brush within a wetlands resource
area located on 28 Parker Road, 30 Parker Road, and 32 Parker
Road. The Commission issued an enforcement order onApril 2,
2008 and an amended enforcement order on June 4, 2008. Mr.
Carney appealed the enforcement order(s) to the Superior Court
under the certiorari statute, G.L. c. 249, §4. The Superior Court
entered judgment in the Town's favor as to all claims, and the
plaintiff appealed this judgment to the Massachusetts Appeals
Court. The Appeals Court issued a ruling on July 11, 2011
affirming theSuperior Court'sjudgment intheTown's favor. The
plaintiff filed an application for further appellate review with the
Supreme Judicial Court, and, the SJC denied the application.
Accordingly, this case has been fully resolved in the Town's favor
and is now closed.
This case involves a certiorari appeal under G.L. c. 249, § 4 by the
plaintiff, Thomas Corrado, of the Conservation Commission's
issuance of a determination of applicability (the "Determination of
Applicability ")in which it found that the Property contains
wetlands subject to the Bylaw and the Wetlands Protection Act.
The Determination further required that Mr. Corrado provide a full
and accurate wetland delineation plan, bring the Property into
compliance with pertinent wetlands laws and regulations, secure
proper review, approval and permitting to conduct future activities
at the Property, and comply with an enforcement order that the
Commission issued on November 19, 2008 determining that the
plaintiff undertook unpermitted filling, tree cutting and grading
activity on the Property in an Area Subject to Protection in
violation ofthe Bylaw. The Commission filed a counterclaim
seeking an injunction requiring the plaintiffs compliance with the
enforcement order. On November 10, 2010, the parties filed a
stipulation of dismissal whereby the plaintiff withdrew his appeal
with prejudice, thereby affirming the terms of the Determination
of Applicability. Rather than dismiss the counterclaim, however,
the stipulation allowed the counter -claim to continue so that the
Commission can ensure that Mr. Corrado brings his property into
compliance. Subsequently, on January 19, 2011, the Commission

issued a further enforcement order that superseded the first to
address new and presently existing violations at the Property. In
August of 2011, the Commission filed an amended counterclaim
to request an order requiring Mr. Corrado's compliance with the
Second Enforcement Order. The Commission intends tomove for
summary judgment as to its counterclaim in 2012.
This case matter involves a challenge by CSE, the current
developer of the Danforth PUD (successor to Pulte Homes and
before Pulte, National Development of New England),of the
Conservation Commission' s January 6, 2010 vote denying CSE's
application to perform certain work in the wetlands area in
connection with its proposed development project located at
Riverpath Drive. In its denial order, the Commission found that
CSE had failed to provide minimum fundamental information and
materials necessary to enable the Commission to approve an order
ofconditions. CSEfiledamotionforjudgment onthepleadings,
which the Town opposed. In December of 2011, the Superior
Court issued an order and written decision denying CSE's motion
and dismissedthe case. CSE appealed theCourt's rulingtothe
Appeals Court. We anticipate thattheAppeals Court willreceive
the parties' briefs and schedule oral argument in 2012.
This case concerns the January 2011 termination of Robert Fish,
who was the Recycling Center Supervisor and a member of DPW
Local 1116. The Union filed a grievance on Mr. Fish's behalf
alleging that the Town terminated Mr. Fish without just cause.
The Union petitioned for the matter to be resolved by arbitration
through the Division of Labor Relations, a state agency that is
authorizedto arbitratepublic employeelabor disputes. The
arbitration is scheduled for October 2012.
This case arises from a request from Fafard Real Estate and
Development Corporation, the developer of the Belport Farms
Subdivision, that the Town accept DiTullio Drive as a public way,
along with related infrastructure (including a sewer pump station
that services the subdivision) and release a bond in the amount of
25,000. The Town contended that it has no obligation to accept
responsibility for operation and maintenance of infrastructure
constructed by a private developer under a 1993 subdivision
decision by the Planning Board and, further, that Fafard had not
completed certain necessary improvements to the pumping station.
Fafard commenced an action against the Town in the Land Court
in June, 2010. In 2011, the parties engaged in mediation and
reached a settlement whereby the parties agreed to share the costs
of removing the pumping station and building a gravity sewer line.
The case is now closed.

2011 Annual Town Report
This case involves a petition filed in August, 2010 by the
Framingham Firefighters' bargaining unit, Local 1652, to have the
Joint Labor and Management Committee exercise jurisdiction over
the parties' negotiation for a new collective bargaining agreement.
The JLMC is a state body that intervenes in labor negotiations
between municipalities and police and fire unions to attempt to
resolve bargaining impasses through means such as arbitration or
mediation. Local 1652 asserts thattheparties have reached an
impasse in negotiations with regard to wages, clothing, step raises,
and placing stipend funds into the firefighters' base salaries. The
Town agreed to submit to the JLMC's jurisdiction in this matter.
Local 1652 and the Town recently participated in one unsuccessful
mediation session before Brian Harrington and the JLMC voted to
exercisejurisdiction for formal fact finding and arbitration. Prior
to formal fact finding and arbitration, the Town and Local 1652
reached agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement,
which was approved by Town Meeting on May 24, 2011. This
case is now closed.
This case involves a petition filed in August, 2010 by the
Framingham Police Officers union to ask the JLMC to exercise
jurisdiction over the parties' negotiation for a new collective
bargaining agreement. Threemediation sessions beforeJLMC
Mediator Brian Harrington did not yield a settlement and the
parties participated in a formal fact finding arbitration before the
JLMC on February 16, 2012. Following the arbitration, the JLMC
will enter an award which will, subject to Town Meeting approval,
become the new collective bargaining agreement between the
Town and the FPOU for FY 2009 -11.
The Framingham Police Officers Union (FPOU) filed this unfair
labor practice charge with the Massachusetts Labor Relations
Commission, now the Division of Labor Resources (DLR),
following the Town's issuance of correspondence to the FPOU in
April of 2007 reaffirming the existence of the Town's 24 day work
period pursuant to 29 USC 207(k) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
The FPOU's charge alleged that the Town's correspondence
regarding the existence of the 24 day work period was a change in
working conditions that required bargaining. Following the United
States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit's order affirming
summary judgment in the Town's favor in Calvao, et al. v. Town
of Framingham the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts entered a Consent Judgment confirming the validity
of the Town's 24 day work period for Framingham patrol officers
under 29 U.C. § S. 207(k).Notwithstanding the Consent Judgment
and the First Circuit decision that legally affirmed that the 24 day
work period was effectively established in 1986, the
Commonwealth Employment Relations Board (CERB) issued a

hearing.
In 2007 Patrolman Eduardo Rivera filed a demand for arbitration
appealing a disciplinary suspension. The Town filed an action in
Middlesex Superior Court to enjoin the arbitration on the grounds
that the CBA expressly provides that the proper forum to appeal
disciplinary decisions is the Civil Service Commission rather than
arbitration. After the Superior Court granted the Town's motion
for apreliminary injunction to enjoin the arbitration, the FPOU
filed a motion for summary judgment on August 18, 2009. The
Town opposed this motion and accompanied its opposition with its
own cross -motion for summary judgment. On February 5, 2010,
the Superior Court issued an order denying the FPOU's motion for
summaryjudgment and granting the Town's cross -motion. The
FPOU appealed the Superior Court's order to the Massachusetts
Appeals Court. After briefs were filed and oral argument held, the
Appeals Court issued a decision on September 29, 2011 affirming
the order ofthe Superior Court. The FPOU did not seek further
appellate review and therefore this case has been fully decided in
favor of the Town and is closed.
This case concerns the appeal of an arbitration decision issued in
favor of the PEC over the Town's plan to implement different
health insurance plans for new employees after January 1, 2010.
The arbitration occurred in April and May 2010 and a decision in
favor of the PEC was issued in August, 2010. The Superior Court
denied the Town's motion to vacate the arbitration award and
allowed thePEC'smotion toconfirm thearbitration award. The
Board of Selectmen authorized an appeal of the Superior Court
decision. Prior to proceeding with the appeal, the Town and the
PEC reached agreement on health insurance benefits for 2011.
This case is now closed.
Hess Corporation filed an appeal in February of 2009 of a decision
by the Zoning Board of Appeals denying it a special permit
modification foritsgasstation located at272 Hollis Street. The
Land Court held a trial in this matter on June 23, 2010. Following
trial the parties filed post -trial briefs. (This is the second trial held
in Hess Corporation's efforts to obtain permitting for 272 Hollis
Street. The ZBA's denialofa specialpermitforthis locationwas
upheld at a trial held in 2006.)The Land Court issued a decision
upholding the Zoning Board of Appeals decision to deny a special
permit for the addition of a convenience store to the gas station.
After Hess Corporation appealed the decision to the Appeals
Court, the parties filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of the

318083 KCL 
2011 Annual Town Report
appeal dated June 7, 2011. This case has been fully decided in the
Town's favor and is closed.
This matter arises out of the Conservation Commission's attempt
to enforce wetlands violations at property owned by plaintiffs
Roger and Dawn Levasseur at 49 Gates Street (the "Property ").
The plaintiffs purchased the Property on or about December 12,
2008 fromLeonidas andElaine Exarchos. After conducting a
review, the Commission concluded that the Property contains
wetlands areas that have been disturbed, including by grass and
fencing that was installed in connection with backyard expansion
activities. The Levasseurs have allegedthattheviolations were
committed by the Exharchoses or other prior owner(s) of the
property. The Commission voted to issue an enforcement order
on December 17, 2008, and issued a subsequent enforcement order
the "Enforcement Order ") on January 7, 2009. The Levasseurs
appealed the Enforcement Order to the Superior Court under the
certiorari statute, G.L. c. 249, §4. Thereafter, on June 8, 2010, the
plaintiffs added a number ofdefendants to the lawsuit, including
the Exarchoses andtwo attorneys involved in the closing. Intheir
answer, the Exarchoses included a cross -claim against the Town
and the Framingham Conservation Commission seeking money
damages and attorney's fees. The plaintiffs filed amotion for
judgment on the pleadings and the Court held a hearing on the
motion on January 11, 2011. On March 7, 2011, the Court issued
an order denying the plaintiffs' motion for judgment on the
pleadings and affirming the Enforcement Order issued by the
Commission. After initially appealing this ruling the Levasseurs
elected not to pursue their appeal and it was administratively
dismissed by the Appeals Court on August 11, 2011. The parties
have not yet commenced discovery practice with regard to the
Levasseurs' claims against the Exarchoses or the Exarchoses'
claims against the Town.
This is the first of the Paulin lawsuits, and it is has been stayed by
the court pending the outcome of the third lawsuit, which will be
described below. In December of 2005, the Zoning Board of
Appeals denied Paulin Loam's application for a special permit to
construct a concrete batchingplant at the Property. Atthe time of
the initial application, the property was zoned General
Manufacturing. Paulini claimed that the concrete batching plant
was allowed under Section III.l.G.a of the Zoning Bylaw, which
allows "manufacturing ofany description utilizing processes free
from neighborhood disturbing odors and /or other agencies" in the
General Manufacturing district. The Building Commissionerhad
ruled that the proposed use required a special permit under Section
III.2G.as a use "which would be offensive because of injurious or
obnoxious noise, vibration, smoke, gas, fumes, odors, dust or other

objectionable features...." Paulini filed this appeal seeking to
overturn the ZBA's denial of the special permit, and to obtain a
declaration from the Court that the proposed plant did not require
a special permit. There has been extensive discovery, including
depositions, in this case, but it has been stayed by the Court for
several years.
This casehas also been stayedby the Land Court. In December of
2005, a Special Town Meeting approved two amendments to the
Zoning By -law, one of which changed the zoning designation of
the area to Office Professional, such thattheproposed usebecame
prohibited and could not be authorized even through a special
permit. The second amendment changed the procedures and
thresholds for site plan review. Paulini filed this second lawsuit,
this time naming the town as defendant, challenging the validity of
the Zoning By -law amendments. In the meantime, Paulini had
filed a definitive subdivision plan for the Property, which was
approved by the Planning Board, thereby freezing the zoning of
the Property for 8 years from the date the subdivision plan was
approved. As a result, the Property is still governed by the General
Manufacturing zoning asitexisted in2005. We filed amotion for
summary judgment on behalf of the Town in this case, arguing
that the two amendments are valid as a matter of law. That motion
is still pending at the Land Court
This case represents the most recent appeal filed by Paulini Loam,
LLC, appealing the Zoning Board's 2005 decision to uphold the
Building Commissioner's denial of a building permit for the
proposed concrete manufacturing plant. Paulini's complaint
includes two counts: the first is an appeal under G.L. c. 40A §17
of the Board's decision, and the second is a request for a
declaratory judgment that the proposed use of the site for a
concrete manufacturing facility is allowed by right under the
Zoning Bylaw. The Board filed a motion for summaryjudgment
on the grounds that it is not disputed that the plans submitted to
the Building Commissioner showed a structure, within the
meaning of the Zoning Bylaw, within a required setback. Since
this is a violation of the Zoning Bylaw, and would require a
variance from the Board of Appeals, the Town contends that this
reason alone is sufficient to uphold the Board's decision, without
the need for the court to review whether the denial of the building
permit was also justified because the proposed use requires a
special permit. Paulini also requested a declaratoryjudgment from
the court under G.L. c. 
240 § 14A that the proposed use was a use
allowed by right and did not require a special permit from the
BoardofAppeals. The Town argues inresponse thatthis countof
the complaint should be dismissed because it is simply a
duplication of the chapter 40A section 17 appeal and, in any event,

Paulini already has a request for a declaratory judgment in its
earlier appeal, and therefore this count was barred by that prior
pending action. Thecourtheld ahearing ontheBoard's motion
for summary judgment on June 1, 2010. The court took the matter
under advisement and has not yet issued a decision.
This is a case filed by Revoli Construction Co.,Inc. against the
Town on February 25, 2011. Revoli seeks claims against the
Town totaling approximately $300,000 for additional
compensation that Revoli alleges is owed by the Town in
connection with Revoli's work on a sewer line replacement project
onandnear Water Street. The Town denies liability and has filed
a counterclaim against Revoli for sums expended by the Town in
securing Revoli's correction of its defective installation of a large
segment ofsewer pipe. In2011 theparties exchanged various
motions seeking to modifypleadings and add claims. Theparties
alsoserved discovery requests. Discovery isexpected tocontinue
in 2012.
This case concerns the appeal to the Civil Service Commission of
an originalappointmentbypass. Theapplicantwas a candidate for
an original appointment as a firefighter in the Framingham Fire
Department. After a background checkthe Department bypassed
Mr. Robinson in favor of another candidate lower on the list of
eligible candidates. The matterwas scheduled for ahearing in
December of 2011. Mr. Robinson failed to appear for the hearing
and the Commission dismissed the appeal for failure to prosecute.
This case is now closed.
This case involves a construction dispute between the Town and
SB General Contracting, Inc. ( " SB "),the general contractor for the
New York Avenue Utility Corridor Project ( "Project "),a Town
publicworks projectthat wasperformed primarily in2010. The
Project consisted of work on two streets, New York Avenue and
California Avenue, and generally involved replacing existing
sewer force mains with new larger diameter force mains. In
March of 2011, SB filed a lawsuit against the Town claiming the
Town breached the Project agreement by failing to pay SB for
certain items ofwork forthe Project. The total damages alleged
by SB are $341,021 plus interest, which the Town disputes. The
parties have engaged in written discovery and the Town recently
served a motion for partial summary judgment seeking to dismiss
aportion ofSB's claims. Theparties arepresently attemptingto
resolve the case by voluntary mediation.

This case involves a certiorari appeal under G.L. c. 249, §4 by the
plaintiff, Gerard Spagnuolo, of the Conservation Commission's
issuance of an enforcement order on December 2, 2009, as
amendedbythe Commission in January of2010. The
Commission found that the plaintiff had conducted various
unpermitted activities on property located at 545 Edgell Road
within a wetlands resource area and /or buffer zone in violation of
the Wetlands Protection Bylaw and the Wetlands Protection Act.
The unpermitted activities that the Commission found to have
been undertaken include, among other things, significant cutting,
filling, and grading above and within a steep embankment
resulting in a deposit of boulders and debris in the wetlands),
stockpiling of fill and sediment surrounding several mature trees,
and failure to install erosion controls.
On January 5, 2012 the Land Court entered an order transferring
this case to the Superior Court in accordance with Land Court
precedent holding that the Land Court lacks jurisdiction over
wetlands disputes ofthisnature. Theplaintiffappealed theLand
Court's order. In 2012, the appeal will be defended by the Town
and the Town intends to move for judgment on the pleadings.
This case is related to the above action between Mr. Spagnuolo
and the Conservation Commission. On July 7, 2011, Mr.
Spagnuolo filed a certiorari appeal of a further enforcement order
issued by the Commission on or about June 22, 2011, which the
Commission issued upon the discovery of new wetlands
violations. TheCommission removed thecasetoFederalCourtin
view of numerous allegations in Mr. Spagnuolo's complaint
allegingviolations ofFederal statutes. The Federal Court
remanded the case back to the Land Court on October 6, 2011, on
the basis of its determination that Mr. Spagnuolo's allegations
constituted defenses rather than affirmative federal claims.
On January 5, 2012 the Land Court entered an order transferring
this case to the Superior Court on the Town's motion because the
Land Court lacks jurisdiction over wetlands disputes of this nature.
Theplaintiffappealed the Land Court's order. Upon transfer to
the Superior Court (subject to the outcome of the Mr. Spagnuolo's
appeal),the Commission intends to seek consolidation of this case
with the above -referenced litigation between Mr. Spagnuolo and
the Commission (i.e.,Land Court Misc. 10 MISC 424760).
This case involves a request by Robert Talmo, owner of the
property at 28 Nixon Road, for zoning enforcement with respect to
the abutting property at 30 Nixon Road. Mr. Talmo alleges that a
barn on the property at 30 Nixon Road, which is in a residential
zoning district, is not in compliance with the Zoning Bylaw. The

Board has served discovery requests and responses upon the
plaintiff. On February 10, 2012 the plaintiff filed a motion for
summaryjudgment. Currently theTownispreparing an
opposition to this motion.
This is a second case filed by Robert Talmo against the Zoning
Board of Appeals. By letter dated March 11, 2011, the plaintiff
requested that the Framingham Building Commissioner enforce
the provisions of the Town's Zoning By -law with respect to the
propertylocated at 30Nixon Road. Afterthe Building
Commissioner denied the request, the Zoning Board of Appeals
affirmed the denial on appeal. The Board's decision was filed with
the Town Clerk's office on September 22, 2011. The plaintiff
filed this case in the Land Court as an appeal of the Board's
decision. However, because the plaintiff failed to file his notice of
appeal with the Town Clerk until October 25, 2011, 33 days after
the Board's decision, the Board moved to dismiss the complaint as
untimely. Shortly afterthe Boardmoved to dismiss theplaintiff
withdrew thisappeal. Thiscaseisnowclosed.
This case involves an appeal by T- Mobile of the ZBA's July 13,
2010 decision denying T- Mobile's application for use and
dimensional variances and a special permit in connection with T-
Mobile's planned construction and installation, operation and
maintenance of a proposed wireless communications facility on
property leased by T- Mobile located at 300 Pleasant Street (the
Decision).The parties filed an agreement for judgment in this
matter on January 30, 2012. The Court approved the Agreement
for Judgment on January 31, 2012 and entered an order
terminating this case.
This matter concerned a suit against the owner /operator ofthe
Natick Collection over unpaid sewer charges from 1995 through
2007, totaling nearly $700,000, as determined by a recent audit of
outoftownseweraccounts. TheNatickCollection asserted
counterclaims alleging that the out of town rates they were
charged violated statutory provisions for rate -setting requiring
uniform rates, and that the Town's claims are unconstitutional in
that they seek a "tax" on the Natick Collection outside of
Framingham's local powers afforded to it by the legislature.
Natick Collection successfully moved for summary judgment,
obtaining a ruling from the Court that the claims for unpaid sewer
charges prior to November of 2004 are barred by the statute of
limitations. Theparties subsequently reached a settlement onthe
Town's remaining post -2004 claims and Natick Mall's remaining
post -2004 counterclaims. This matter is now closed.
This case was filed by Verizon New England Inc. ( "Verizon ") in
May of 2011 against Defelice Corp. ( "Defelice ") and the Town

This is an action against the Town and two of its police officers
for the allegedly wrongful arrest and prosecution of the plaintiff,
Thomas Grassia. (Mr. Grassia is a local attorney.) The plaintiff
alleges that there was no probable cause for his August 13, 2004
arrest on felony and misdemeanor charges of intimidation of a
witness and criminal harassment. Theplaintiffsought
compensatory and punitive relief, as well as attorney's fees and
costs for harm allegedly suffered pursuant to various provisions
of the United States Constitution, 42 U.C. § S. 1983, the
Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, provisions of the
Massachusetts General Laws, and the common law. The District
Court entered summary judgment in favor of the Town and the
individual police officer defendants on August 3, 2010. The
plaintiff appealed the judgment to the United States Court of
Appeals for the First Circuit. On June 24, 2011 the Court of
Appeals issued a ruling affirming the District Court's judgment.
This case is now closed.
This case concerns the developer's appeal of the denial of special
permits in 2004 to construct the Ford's Meadow Project on Nixon
Road. The developer contends thatthePlanning Board abused its
discretion in not approving needed special permits by the requisite
supermajority. ThePlanningBoardwasrepresentedinthiscase
by special counsel Hinckley Allen & Snyder. A trial was held in
2009. In July of 2009, the Court issued a 20 page Findings of Fact
and Conclusions of Law deciding the case in favor of the Planning
Board. Nexum appealed this ruling tothe Massachusetts Appeals
Court. The Appeals Court issued a ruling on March 18, 2011,
affirming theSuperior Court'sjudgment. Thiscaseisnowclosed.
This case concerns a Charge of Discrimination filed against the
Town and its Department ofPublic Works. MIIA has retained the
firm of Brody, Hardoon, Perkins and Kesten to represent the Town
in this matter. Position statements have been filed bytheparties
and we are awaiting a decision from the MCAD as to whether a
Finding of Probable Cause will issue.
This matter involves numerous federal and state court actions
against the Town by a state prison inmate alleging, among other
things, unlawful arrest, conspiracy and assault and battery. The
Federal District Court of Massachusetts dismissed the case with
prejudice in September, 2008. The United States Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit issued an Order on April 23, 2009 directing
the Clerk of Court not to accept any further filings by Mr. Tang in
this matter. Mr. Tang subsequently filed several other lawsuits
against the Town in Superior Court, which filings ultimately
resulted in the Superior Court's issuance of a similar order barring
further state court filings absent preliminary state approval. Mr.
Tang appealed all or virtually all such dismissals to the 
29

Massachusetts Appeals Court. Four ofthese actions arepending
before the Appeals Court, and Mr. Tang has served the Town in
only one. Mr. Tang filed his brief on January 30, 2012 in this case
and the Town's insurance counsel will file the Town's responsive
brief shortly.
III. Budgetary Overview
As in past years, I would like to
conclude this report with a brief discussion of
budgeting andlegal expenses. In 2011 this
office continued its positive track record of
procuring new revenue for the General Fund
or helping to avoid the imposition of
additional costs totheTown. The services
provided by the Office of the Town Counsel
have resulted in monetary benefits to the
Town that has resulted in direct revenue, 
mitigation and avoided expenses
approximately two times greater than the
Town's FY 2011 appropriation of $623,000.
Below is a chart summarizing the
revenue, mitigation and avoided expenses
achieved in FY 2011 by the efforts of the
Office of Town Counsel working with other
departments, boards or commissions, or
through the substantial assistance of this
office.

Description:
Payments received in FY2011 for sewage transport under the
February 13, 2004 Decision issued by the Department of
Telecommunications and Energy, and pursuant to the January 1, 2007
IMAbetweenAshlandandFramingham. Thisrepresents an
approximately 200 -fold increase over what Framingham received
from 1964 -2003 under the 1963 Intermunicipal Agreement with
Ashland ($5500 per year).Through 2011 the Town has received over
6 million dollars in payments from Ashland ($6,016) 169,under the
successful 2004 Decision and the 2007 IMA that resulted.
By virtue of a prior year's favorable summary judgment ruling
achieved in the Pelham litigation, the Town was able to cease trash
collection at the 550 units at the Pelham Apartments, which results in
avoided expenses estimated at more than $100,000 per year. By
virtue of the Pelham ruling, the Town also was able to cease trash
collection at approximately 1,000 units owned by the Framingham
Housing Authority, thus realizing savings of approximately an
additional estimated $200,000 per year. These savings amount to
approximately $300,000 per year on an annual recurring basis without
adjusting for inflation.
As a result of the United States Court of Appeals for the First
Circuit's March 17, 2010 decision affirming the District Court's
decision allowing the Town's Motion for Summary Judgment with
respect to the Town's establishment of a 24 -day work period under

approximately $1,000500,in damages, in view of the federal law that
often allows for double damages and attorney's fees to be assessed
against parties found to have violated the Fair Labor Standards Act.
Additionally, the Town has to date avoided the need to pay FLSA
overtime to officers who work more than 40 hours per week (CBA
overtime is paid),thus saving the Town approximately $150,000 per
year on an annual basis.

2011 Annual Town Report
The Building Services Department is primarily
tasked with the facility maintenance of
multiple Town -Owned buildings throughout
the Town ofFramingham. The department
has been restructured in the last fiscal year to
create two new positions after losing the
longtime Director and Assistant Director
through attrition. The newly created positions
include a  Working Foreman and
Administrative Assistant. The department
head for this department works directly under
the jurisdiction of the Assistant Town
Manager.
Facing decreasing budget allocations and
minimal staffing numbers, the department has
modified its approach to obtaining its goals.
Due to the aging of the buildings and the
maintenance needs required, the department
has subcontracted the general cleaning
services of the Memorial Building out to a
private contractor. This has allowed the staff
of Building Services to focus their attention
on the maintenance needs for the Town -
Owned buildings. We have been working
diligently, in collaboration with the Parks
Department, to create a  much safer and
cleaner appearance for all Town citizens to
see and appreciate when visiting the Memorial
Building for regular business matters.
The Memorial Building is enclosing on the
completion of the window renovation capital 
project, which has increased energy efficiency
for the building. The central air conditioning
project is scheduled to begin in March 2012,
with an anticipated 90 day completion date.
These projects are being overseen by the
Town's Capital Project Manager and
coordinated with the Building Services
Department to ensure effective and efficient
results. The plans and funding have also been
allocated to have the Nevin's Hall floors
refinished once the interior painting has been
completed.
In addition to facility management, the
Building Services Department is responsible
for the management of three Town operated
parking lots. These include the Pearl Street
Garage, Hollis Street Parking Lot, and the
Waverly Street Parking Lot. By working in
collaboration with local community service
representatives, the department has been able
to properly clean these parking locations to
regularly remove garbage and debris.
I would like to thank my staff, Raymond
Spurgeon, Gregory Adams, David DeMeo,
Ashley Borges, Charles Weld, Ken Green,
Ron Spurgeon and Doug Thibault, for their
continued dedication to the Town of
Framingham.

Town of Framingham  2011 Annual Town Report
December 1, 2011 marked my third year of
service as the Capital Building Projects
Manager for the Town ofFramingham. Ithas
been a  privilege to serve in this capacity.
During the past year, I have been able to
better understand the existing conditions of
many of the Town -Owned properties, and
determine where the financial and technical
challenges exist moving forward.
Many Town -Owned Buildings are in need of
help in the form of renovations or
reconstruction invarious degrees. Deferred
maintenance has often been used to cut costs.
This "sense" of saving money is actually false
economy. Taking careofbuildings before
they crumble will save money in the long run.
As the Capital Building Projects Manager my
duties include working with the Town
Manager to help envision and expedite
strategic building projects. The project this
yearincluded: Replacing alltheMemorial
Building Windows; repairing the Vault and
Accounting Office Space and Floors;
Maynard Building work; repair working on the
Fire Department Headquarters, various Fire
Stations andtheMainLibrary. Onthese
project I have acted as Project Manager,
OPM, Architect and Clerk with the idea of
providing a savings to the Taxpayers of
Framingham. ThishassavedtheTown
considerable time and money since only on
salary has to be paid for this work instead of
four. The challenge is to do more with less,
to manage time for the research, design, bid,
execution and monitoring of all project
simultaneously. The requirementis to keep
the clients of each building happy while
creating dust, noise and, ultimately,
accomplishment.
The position of Capital Building Projects
Manager has also allowed me to be an energy 
advocate on behalf of the Selectmen of
Framingham. The desire is to decrease the
energy consumption of Town -Owned
Buildings. Thiswillservethreepurposes:
1. Saving the Framingham Tax payer's
money
2. Reducing the "carbon footprint" of
Framingham
3. Repairing or replacing the existing,
outdated equipment, as required.
This part of my position has been interesting
to me since energy saving technology has
always beenoneofmykeeninterests. This
part of my job has drawn the attention of
State Officials and afforded the Town of
Framingham the opportunity to take
advantage of federal stimulus funding. This
has created good jobs in Framingham over
the past year.
As the Capital Building Project Manager
during 2011, my position has included
working the Framingham Disability
Commission. IhavemetwiththeDisability
Commission and the Historical Commissions
within Town to learn, listen and understand
their views and positions on key historical
buildings regarding handicapped building
access. These concerns are as follows:
1. Construction of a ramp to the Union
Street entrance of the Memorial
Building
2. The construction of a sloped walkway
at the Village Hall
3. Ongoing discussions to make existing
entrances at the Main Library ADA
compliant.
4. Completing these projects while
maintaining the historical significance
of all these buildings
Another major project this office has taken on
is the exterior renovation of the Jonathan

these renovations is to maintain the original

The mission of The Government Channel is
to serve the community as a valued resource
by providing timely news and events to
inform Framingham residents on town
programs and services. We do this by
producing video coverage of public meetings,
development of original series, and displaying
important town announcements on our
municipal electronic bulletin board.
The Government Channel is dedicated to
programming which supports the goals and
objectives of the various town departments,
also to make the proceedings of local
government more accessible to the public.
Some of the outreach, engagement activities,
and production support that the government
channel has participated in 2011 include the
Memorial and Veterans day observance
ceremony, Human Relations Commission
lectures, DPW neighborhood meetings,
Redistricting forums, New Open Meeting
Law training, Park and Recreation updates,
Arbor day education and observance, General

ETIREMENT SYSTEM
a 
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer
hasbothfinancial andpolicy duties. Itis
staffed by the Chief Financial Officer and
anAssistant ChiefFinancial Officer. The
Office administers Town finances with
the assistance of three departments that
have direct responsibility for financial
management ofTown government: the
Assessing Department is responsible for
the administration of the property tax
system including the valuation of real and
personal property and the assessment of
taxes against these parcels and accounts.
The Office of the Treasurer/ Collector is
responsible for the collection of all town
revenues, the investment of all revenues,
and the management of the Town's debt.
The Accounting Department maintains
the Town's accounting records, generates
financial management information for use
by all Town departments in the
management of  their operations,
processes Town -wide employee payroll,
directs all audit activity and reviews
compliance with internal controls.
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer
is directly responsible for the development
of the annual operating and capital
budgets. The CFO works closely with all
Town officials to develop these budgets.
Upon adoption of the annual operating
and capital budgets, the Office of the
Chief Financial Officer monitors revenue
and spending throughout theyear. The
CFO is also required to file a long term
forecast for strategic planning of the
Towns financial position.
Other responsibilities of the Chief
Financial Officer include participation in
Finance 
management of workers' compensation
claims; management of the health
insurance plan, participation in collective
bargaining and membership on the
Retirement Board.
Calendar year 2011 was a step toward
financial stability. For the first time in
many years the Town was 
able to
appropriate a level service School budget.
While expenditure growth still exceeds
revenue growth, the trend is slowing due
both to increasing state aid and cost
containment efforts. TheTown muststill
live within its means. During calendar year
2011 the Town and the Public Employee
Committee agreed to two new health
insurance contracts that reduce the cost of
health insurance both to the Town and to
employees. The expectation is that health
insurance will reduce its burden on the
budget in FY13. The Town continued its
investment of the room and meals tax to
the Stabilization fund reaching a level of
3% of the total budget. If this plan is
followed through FY15, the Town will
have funded the Stabilization Fund to its
policy level of 5% of the total budget.
Continued responsible financial
management is critical to the forward
progress of the Town.
This Division has absorbed more
responsibility without adequate resources,
yet still provides the clarity and
transparency of information to Town
residents and excelling in their fiduciary
duties. The staff has produced more data
to more residents and officials than ever
before and posted more information to
40

Annual Report 
Town of Framingham  2011
Fiscal Year 2011 was a good year in this
busy office of  7.  The
Treasurer/ Collector's Office continues to
provide customer service and essential
municipal services. As always, I  am
indebted to my staff for the firs -class job
they do on my behalf as well as the Town
of Framingham.
Our operating system on Munis continues
to be updated on a  regular basis.
Collection amounts and percentages were
as follows. Real Estate taxes collected
were $ 144,025.918,47 (97.73 %) ,  and
Personal Property taxes were
9,108.731,49 (98.37 %).  Excise Taxes
collected were $ 5,039.072,86 (86.44 %).
Excise tax is collected on a calendar -year
basis, which is reflected in the lower
collection percentage. Tax Title
collections were $ 2,865.055,80, including
interest and penalties. We have continued
to work hard on delinquent taxes in every
area and recently foreclosed on an
unoccupied property and will schedule an
auction soon.We have implemented the
use of credit /debit card swipe machines
and promoted our web based online biller
and payment services in the Tax
Collectors Office, to improve customer
service.
Earnings on general fund investments for
the year totaling $ 139,07034.were below
budget.
We continue to monitor the bank rates to
maximize our earnings. The Town's Bond
Rating is  currently at Aa2 with a
Challenging outlook in FY 2012 from
Moody's. The future will hold a challenge
to maintain it but the goal is to work to
that end. We need to improve our fund
balances to help offset those areas that we 
have little control over, such as per capita
income levels. We issued one multi-
purpose bond anticipation note in
2011 ,  awarded to  J.MorganP.
Securities Inc., in the amount of
33,977 , 167, including a premium of
893,30545. and net interest cost of 0
2909 %.,  and a coupon rate of 3.00 %.
Additionally we issued a general obligation
bond in the amount of $34,000302, for
multiple projects awarded to Raymond
James &  Associates, Inc. NY. at a true
interest cost of 3.03309 %  among several
bidders. The bid included a premium of $
1,820.545,62. This was the most
competitive rate in the face of stable fed
fund rates. Additionally, the Town issued
interim loans totaling $ 2,924.749,00
through the Massachusetts Water
Pollution Abatement Trust at a rate of 0
25 %,  as well as permanently financing
sewer projects in the amount of
20,233.859,77 at a rate of 2.00 %  for
various sewer improvement projects.
This department has worked diligently to
meet the requirements of the laws, the
challenges of the technology advances,
and the Town's customer service policy.
We treat taxpayers with respect while
accepting their payments, answering their
questions regarding process, and solving
their problems as quickly and efficiently as
possible. As per Town By -Law, I  am
reporting the following information
regarding authorized debt schedules. The
first schedule shows what is authorized
and un- issued as of June 30, 2011. The
second schedule shows the debt issued
and outstanding during Fiscal Year 2011.
Respectfully submitted,
Stephen W. Price, Treasurer/ Collector

Annual Report 
Town of Framingham  2011
e ..
The Board ofAssessors' annual report for
calendar year 2010 with statistics from
Fiscal Year 2011 is as follows:
Because of the values established in Fiscal
Year 2011, we received 502 abatement
applications. These applications
represented 2.44% of the total tax bills
issued for Fiscal Year 2011.
In Fiscal Year 2012 the residential class
contributed $13.7 million dollars in new
value. This growth was attributed to
improvements made to the residential
inventory during 2011 including new
construction, remodeling and additions
completed during the year.
Commercial, Industrial and Personal
Property growth added $36.2 million
dollars of new taxable improvements to
the CIP tax base with the largest
contribution growth attributed to the
completion of 74 New York Ave.
I would like to thank the Board of
Assessors members Mrs. Kathryn Pierce,
M.A &A. Mr. Arthur Holmes for their
work throughout the Fiscal Year.
Additionally I would like to thank the
Assessing Department staff for all their
hard work throughout the year. Also, I
would like to thank Mr. James Sullivan,
Esquire for his legal assistance.
After making a presentation to the Board
of Selectmen on December 19, 2011 for
the Fiscal year 2012 Tax Rate
Classification Hearing, the Board voted to
adopt a 75% shift in values of the
Commercial, Industrial and Personal
Finance 
Property classes of property to maintain
the share of the tax levy borne by these
classes in Fiscal Year 2012. The Fiscal
Year tax rates are: Residential - $ 16.94 and
Commercial, Industrial and Personal
Property - $38.05.

SERVICES
As we move into 2012, it continues to be
my honor and privilege to serve as Chief
of Police for the Town of Framingham
and I  respectfully submit this annual
report to the community, on behalf of the
men and women of the Framingham
Police Department. I am extremely proud
of the Department and the excellent
service which it provides to those who
live, work, and visit Framingham. It is
and has been my philosophy that we must
strive to serve the community in the most
efficient manner possible. During my
tenure as Chief, I have continually sought
new avenues to improve our effectiveness
and increase the Department' s efficiency,
accountability and productivity. Given
the current fiscal climate, these efforts are
now more important than ever.
Even with limited resources and financial
predictions which have
reduction or elimination 
required a
of certain
services, the Department's dedicated staff
is committed to delivering the very best
public safety services possible. We remain
proud to protect and serve the Town,
while recognizing the value of excellence
in public safety. This excellence has been
recognized by our peers in public safety
and the Department is proud to be leader
in our industry. We have again achieved
State Accreditation and are one of a small
number of  departments in  the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts to have
earned this stamp of approval.
During the past year, the men and women
of this department have achieved
outstanding accomplishments in the areas
of community partnerships and crime
suppression. With the community's 
continued support, we look forward to
continuing this success in the coming
year.

Emergency Management
Framingham Emergency Management
Agency ( FrEMA) directs all emergency
management operations in the Town of
Framingham. Emergency managementis
the preparedness, mitigation, response and
recovery of both naturally occurring
events like blizzards, ice storms,
hurricanes, flooding or earthquakes as well
as  any manmade disasters such as
chemical spills, fires, transportation events
and acts of terrorism. Framingham
Emergency Management has worked
extensively under its current structure to
create planning groups, exercise response
activities, secure funding from grants and
state and federal sources and expand
participation in this municipal function.
Page 95
Town of Framingham
Annual Report 
2011
In September 2010 Frema in concert with
Framingham department of public works
and the Northeast Homeland Security
Regional Advisory Council opened up an
emergency equipment cache located at
FraminghamDPW. This cache is one of
only three in the State and will be used to
disperse equipment and supplies during
emergencies. FrEMAinconjunction
with state and federal authorities,
prepares, administers and implements
Framingham' s CEMP (  Comprehensive
Emergency Management Plan) as well as
the federal mandated NIMCAST. In 2007
the entire CEMP was rewritten and
printed; this is the first time since 1997.
The FrEMA also implemented a mass
notification system in2007. This system
Connect CTY) allows public safety
officials to notify residents and businesses
in Framingham in a matter of minutes,
and enables us to give pertinent
information and instruction.
In 2011 the system made 35 calls
contacting 395,515 residences and
businesses. Asurveywasconducted with
the system in December 2007 and 95.4%
of respondents stated they felt safer with
the system in place.
This year was extremely challenging as we
had two events, Hurricane Irene in August
and the Halloween snow storm that
disrupted power in Framingham for
several days. Eacheventtheemergency
operations center was 
activated and
worked closely withNstar. Wecontinue
to work with Nstar to be better prepared
in the event of prolonged power loss. 
In 2010 Framingham also joined five
other communities (  Ashland, Natick,
Holliston, Hopkinton and Sherborn) to
form the Metrowest Regional Emergency
Planning Committee. This planning
committee conducted a tabletop exercise
on November 17, 2011. The exercise
tested our ability to communicate and
effectively move assets during a multi -
agencyevent. Framinghamwillcontinue
to be a leader in the ever increasing role of
emergency management in a post 911 era,
roles and responsibilities are increasing
and the Town will need to recognize the
value of emergency preparedness.
Jail Diversion Program
During 2011 the Jail Diversion Program
evaluated 683 individuals with mental
illness that the police department had
come into contact with. Ofthose 683
evaluations 124 had committed minor
arrestable offenses but were diverted away
from arrest and into mental health
treatmentprograms. Fifty eight ofthe
evaluations would normally have been
evaluated at the Emergency Room at
Metrowest Medical Center but instead
were diverted away and handled by the
program's clinician. Tenofthe
individuals were in fact arrested for their
offences but due to their mental health
condition received court ordered
treatment instead of punitive sanctions.
Revenue
The Framingham Police Department
generates monies through the issuance of
licenses and permits, administration fees
and fines from parking and traffic
citations. Thisrevenue isnotentered into
the police budget but that of the town's
general fund. Revenues are as follows:

The department is fortunate to have
firefighters who serve in the Armed
Services and the Town and Department
provide assistance and support to the
families of these military members when
they are deployed for active combat duty;
many thanks to those who have served on
our behalf.
The operation of the Fire Department is
large and complex. We do more than
simply respond to fires, rescues and
medical emergencies. Because some of
the incidents we encounter are larger or
more technical than the resources readily
available to the fire department, we work
collaboratively with various departments
and agencies both in and outside the
town. Some of these collaborations
include: 
Unified Fire and Police Fire
Investigation Unit (FIU).
Fire District #  14 Regional
Technical Rescue Operations.
Fire District #14 Collaborative

FIRE PREVENTION DIVISION:
The Division of Fire Prevention is
comprised of one Fire Marshal, Assistant
Fire Marshal and one Inspector that have
the following responsibilities:
The Fire Marshal is responsible for the
day -to -day operation of the fire
prevention office. He is also responsible
for conducting fire investigations and
coordinating activities between the
Framingham Police Department and the
State Fire Marshal' s office. Other
responsibilities of the Marshal include
giving safety talks for Framingham's
schools, citizens groups, group residences,
and setting up tours of the fire stations.
The Marshal also meets on a regular basis
with other town departments to assist in
the planning ofthe town's future. The
Marshal also sits on the Traffic and
Roadway Safety Committee.
The Assistant Fire Marshal is responsible
for reviewing the construction plans that
aresubmitted totheFireDepartment. He
also meets with contractors regarding fire
alarm and sprinkler systems, as well as
conducting meetings with contractors,
engineers and property owners for up- 
coming projects and any problems that
arise during construction. He coordinates
with other Town Departments on
important issues such as overcrowding,
boarding and lodging house issues.
The Inspector is responsible for issuing
permits and conducting the inspections
required by state and local codes. He also
inspects and test all new homes, new and
remodeled commercial buildings as well as
renovation projects. The Inspector
investigates and works in conjunction
with other town departments to handle
complaints by citizens and town
departments to assure the safety of
Framingham's residents, their guests, and
the ever -increasing Framingham business
community.
The goal of the Framingham Fire
Department is to establish a  fire and
safety education program that will be
delivered to preschool, day care, grades K-
6, Boy and Girl Scout troops as well as
church, community groups and the
elderly. By visiting these groups on an
annual basis, the safety message that they
receive will become part of their lives and
each child as they grow will always be

TRAINING:
The primary objective of training is to
facilitate safe and effective operations.
National statistics continually cite
emergency vehicle operations as the
greatest are of liability. To that end it was
the first major training area to be
addressed in 2010. A professional outside
agency was brought in to deliver an
emergency vehicle operator course to the
Department. The course consisted of a
classroom component in which all general
laws and best practices were highlighted,
and a practical component in which all
members had to manipulate their assigned
apparatus through an obstacle course of
highway cones. This standardized
emergency vehicle operations class is
parallels the commercial driver's license
course. This training helped to identify
needs and establish some goals and
objectives for the upcoming year's
Public Safety & Health 
training; specifically the daily vehicle
check, operator's brake system check and
new driver training. All three training
needs are in development and will be
implemented inthespring of2011. The
Framingham Fire Department Training
will remain proactive in regards to safe
emergency vehicle operations.
The majority of training hours are devoted
to basic firefighting and medical rescue
skill maintenance. Most ofthis training is
conducted by the officers as company
leveldrills. Of the basic skills, the self -
contained breathing apparatus (  SCBA)
poses the most liability and remains a top
trainingpriority. SCBAtraining isbroken
down into two sections —  basic
procedures and emergency procedures.
On a  regular basis all members must
demonstrate proficiency in both areas.
Other company level drills follow

standardized tactics and procedures and
cover a diverse range of skills such as
ground ladders, hand tools, extrication,
metering devices and medical care. With
the exception of Sundays and holidays,
training isconducted on everyshift. All
training is documented electronically and
quality controlled by the training officer.
Each Framingham Firefighter logs
hundreds of hours of training annually.
Technical rescue disciplines are also an
integral part of the Department Trench
rescue, collapse rescue, confined space
rescue, hazardous materials response and
dive team operations are all specialized
FIRE ALARM
The Fire Alarm Division is responsible for
the general maintenance of traffic signals,
controls, the municipal fire alarm system,
master boxes, street boxes and
underground and aerial cable.
Seven (7) new master boxes were added in
2011. We now have a total of 917 boxes
in service in strategic locations throughout
Framingham. Of the 917 boxes, 560 are
master boxes that protect individual
properties, and 357 are street boxes.
In addition to the regular duties of
maintaining and installing the fire alarm
and communication system, the Fire
Alarm Division was also responsible for
maintaining and repairing forty -four (44)
traffic signals, six (  6) 4 -way flashing
signals, twenty -eight ( 28) school zone
signals and two ( 2) 30mph ` S' curve

ambulances. Framingham has experienced
a  steady rise in medical calls as we
responded to 6,557 calls for medical 
assistance in 2011; this is an approximate
4% increase over 2010. Continued
demands on Emergency Medical Services

Medical Reserve Corps (MRC)
The Framingham Medical Reserve Corps
MRC) is an approximately 200 member
local medical and non -medical volunteer
group trained in emergency preparedness
and is under the administration of the
Board of Health. The MRC is  a
specialized component of a 34- community
emergency preparedness region, and a
member of the Local Emergency Planning
Committee (LEPC) and Citizen Corps, a
national network of volunteers dedicated
to homeland- hometown security. In 2011
the Framingham MRC continued to grow,
steered by the dedicated members of the
Executive Committee: Annette
Alderman, Alice Hsu, Cindy Tracy,
Dave Robbins, Florence Goliger, Joan
Metcalfe, Kathie McCarthie who held
monthly planning meetings. Framingham
is one of 13 sentinel communities in
Massachusetts which represents the entire
Public Safety & Health 
2011
state in the national Cities Readiness
Initiative. MRCvolunteers workunder
the direction of local health and safety
officials, and in collaboration with other
local emergency responseprograms. A
state grant provided funding to retro -fit,
stock and organize the MRC trailer which
holds and transports emergency supplies.
The MRC joined MA Responds, the
Massachusetts Department of Public
Health's online registration system, for
database and messaging management.
Because of its role as one of the 13
sentinel communities in Massachusetts,
which represent the entire state in the
national Cities Readiness Initiative,
Framingham's Emergency Dispensing
Plan was audited by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. MRC
members participated in  multiple
trainings, gave out health information at
local fairs, staffed shelters locally and state
wide following multiple weather events
including the hurricane and tornado, took
part in drills related to emergency
preparedness, helped staff all the Town's
flu clinics, and more.
East Middlesex
Project 
Mosquito Control
The East Middlesex Mosquito Control
Project conducts a  program in
Framingham consisting of mosquito
surveillance, larval and adult mosquito
control, ditch maintenance and public
education.
Moderate rains during the spring and early
part of the summer produced normal
mosquito activity through mid- summer.
Frequent rains during August and
September resulted in large populations of
floodwater mosquitoes. The adult
mosquito surveillance program used traps
to collect mosquitoes from 5 Framingham
locations. Data was compiled from 29
mosquito trap collections over 9 nights.
96
Page 109
Town of Framingham
Annual Report
During the summer and early fall, selected
trap collections from Framingham and
other Project communities were tested for
West Nile Virus (WNV) and EEE by the
Mass. Dept. of Public Health. During
2011 there were 6 human WNV cases in
the State including 5  cases from the
metro- Boston area and 2 EEE cases that
were contracted in  southeastern
Massachusetts. Agraduate student intern
monitored recently constructed
stormwater detention basins within the
district to evaluate the capability of these
sites to produce mosquitoes following
individual rain events and during periods
of frequent rains.
The larval mosquito control program
relied on the larvicides Bacillus thuringiensis
var. israelensis (Bti) and methoprene, which
are classified by the EPA as relatively non-
toxic. AnApril helicopter application of
Bti controlled mosquito larvae at 69
wetland acres. Field crews usingportable
sprayers applied Bti in the spring and the
summer to 20 wetland acres when high
densities of mosquito larvae were found in
stagnantwater. Projectpersonnel applied
time- release methoprene pellets to control
Culex mosquito larvae at 6,059 roadside
catchbasins. Culex mosquitoes are
considered the primary vectors of WNV
For adult mosquito control, there were 6
crews assigned to apply Sumithrin to
3,870 acres at night using truck mounted
aerosol sprayers when survey traps
indicated high mosquito populations. 
2011
Advance notification of the spray program
was done through notices in the
MetroWest Daily News and on the Town
website.
The Project used an excavator to maintain
waterways at four sites including 158 feet
of a channel by Georgetown Drive and
Walnut St., 57 feet by Grant St.
Extension, 96 feet by Bishop St. and 81
feetofawaterway bySloane Drive. Hand
tools were used to remove debris from
waterways at two sites including 246 feet
of a channel by Grant St. Extension and
200 feet by Raleigh Rd.
The Project's public education program is
designed to develop awareness within the
public and the private sectors as to their
rolesin mosquito control. The Project
serves as a  resource to residents,
municipal officials and the local media on
mosquitoes and mosquito borne diseases.
A  web  page

For 2011 the Inspectors, Administrators
and Code Enforcement Inspectors within
the Building Department have had a very
active year providing quality customer
service and effective solutions toward
resolving citizen concerns.
The focus of the Department continues to
be the pursuit of the highest quality of
public service by responding to concerns
as they arise, to follow up on previous
concerns, maintain a record of property
activities reviewed by inspectors and
investigators and be responsive to
consumer protection.
The mission of the Building Department
is to provide knowledge and service
regarding local, state, and federal codes
and standards in a manner which supports
our commitment to the safety of our
residents and to the integrity of the
department. Wewillingly participatein
programs of continuing education to keep
our staff informed of the latest technology
and requirements within the building
trades industry as well as customer service
and computer literacy.
The year of 2011 was a carbon copy of
2010 in that the permits and inspections 
were virtually atthe same levels. Some
very interesting high end construction
projects were undertaken this year by
Genzyme, Bose, Staples, Boston Heart
Labs, Town of Framingham DPW, TJX,
and the Edward M. Kennedy Health
Center.
New single and two family homes
remained at last years' pace while
residential additions and renovations were
at record levels which is a leading
indicator of our economic times whereas
consumers are either buying existing
homes or fixing what they currently have.
The valuation on commercial permits has
dropped by 50% however this could be
attributed to size or type of buildings
which normally changes year by year.
The Nuisance Officer has investigated and
pursued over 500 cases involving Trash &
Debris, Commercial Vehicles,
Unregistered Vehicles and Vehicles
Parking within the front Setback.
Code Enforcement inspectors responded
to over eight hundred (800) complaints of
which more than 50% involved housing.
The report illustrates that the inspectors
addressed 58 Rooming House, 77 Illegal
Public Safety & Health  98

complaints and monitored 186 foreclosed
properties.
Sign enforcement and permitting was a
constant challenge due to the Sign Officer
position being cut by 50 %.  Sign
enforcement activities are down by
comparison as a result ofthis cut. Next
year's challenge shall be compounded by
the Sign By -law requirement that every
sign in town be compliant by December 1,
2012.
The Plumbing -Gas Inspector and
Electrical Inspector averaged 8 to 12
inspections per day and also responded to
an average of 1 -2 after hour calls per week
from the Fire and /or Police Department.
The two Building Inspectors averaged 10-
12 inspections per day each and also
conducted over 100 Liquor License
inspections from October 15` thru
January 6` Both inspectors responded to
an average of 2 -3 after hour calls per week
from the Fire and /or Police Departments.
The office staff processed over 2300
Building Permits, 1706 Plumbing & Gas
Permits, and 1424 Electrical Permits as 
2011
well as the general administrative day to
day duties. OurPlans Examiner
processed over 1450 plans and
documents.
I would like to thank all the Town of
Framingham officials, and departments
that we have worked with during the
course ofthe year. We at the Building
Department appreciate the knowledge and
professionalism exhibited town wide.
I would like to personally thank the
Information Technology Department for
their knowledge and dedication in
implementing the changeover of our
permitting system that will streamline
permits and inspections.
In closing, I extend a special THANK
YOU to the entire Building Department
staff whom I have truly appreciated
workingwith during this pastyear. Our
combined efforts have proven to be an
asset to the Town of Framingham.

Weights & Measures
The Weights & Measures Department is
required by state statute to inspect all
weighing and measuring devices in the
Town of Framingham each calendar year.
In 2011, the Department inspected 1216
weighing and measures devices, including
scanning audits. TheDepartment
collected $43,761 in inspection and sealing
fees during 2011. This surpasses the
revenue for 2010. The Department issued
10 civil citations in calendar year 2011, for
the following: pricing errors (scanning),
unsealed gasoline meters. Thetotal fines
amounted to $4612.50 for the calendar
year of 2011. The non -criminal average
fine was $461.25. The Department had
NO cases in Framingham District Court
criminal) for overcharging consumers.
The Department during 2011 saved
consumers and businesses in Framingham
well into the hundreds of dollars by
conducting both mandated and spot
inspections. Thisisinaddition tothefees
and fines collected for the town. Errors
were found and corrected which resulted 
insufficient savings toconsumers. The
Department checked well over 4075 items
in local retail stores to ensure that they
scanned correctly. The Department
found that 99.1% were priced correctly,
8% was underpriced and .1 % was
overpriced.
This was an improvement over the
previous years and shows that our
education and inspection program is
working. The Department investigated
approximately 15 consumer complaints
during the year.
I want to thank Mr. Michael Tusino, the
Acting Director of Inspectional Services,
the town's part time Weights & Measures
Inspector, Edward R. Gentili, and the
Office Manager of Inspectional Services,
Mary Tiziani for all their help and
assistance.

ENGINEERING AND
TRANSPORTATION DIVISION
The Engineering and Transportation Division
is responsible for the planning, design and
construction of capital roadway and utility
infrastructure projects, maintaining
compliance with various State &  Federal
programs such as NPDES Phase II
stormwater, managing the Town's Street
Opening Permit and Trench Opening Permit
programs, reviewing development and
redevelopment plans to ensure roadway and
utility changes conform to the Town's
construction standards, and inspecting
modifications and expansions to the roadway,
water, sewer and stormwater networks. The
Division also provides technical expertise to
the operational divisions of the Public Works
Department, other Town Departments,
various Boards, Committees, and
Commissions, maintains an extensive
Geographical Information System (GIS) and
is the custodian of a  large collection of
irreplaceable paper plans and documents.
In 2011 a significant portion of the Division's
resources were directed toward the
Department's extensive capital improvement
program. Many of the projects in this
program are mandated under MADEP
Administrative Consent Order (ACO). 
The ACO requires the Town to undertake
major sewer construction and rehabilitation
projects over several years with the primary
focus of alleviating reoccurring sanitary sewer
overflows, a violation of State and Federal
law. Failure to comply with the conditions of
the ACO can result in administrative civil or
criminal action. Continued improvements to
the infrastructure and maintenance
management of the wastewater system have
resulted in significant reductions in Sewer
System Overflows (SSO's).
During 2011 twenty -eight major capital
improvement projects were completed or
advanced. Almost fifty -four thousand linear
feet (over ten miles) of water and wastewater
mains were replaced or rehabilitated.
Locations included Concord Street, A Street,
Gorman Road, Grant Street, Grant Street
Extension, Hartford Street, Arthur Street, Old
Connecticut Path, Edgell Road, Auburn
Street, Auburn Street Extension, Beulah
Street, Elder Street, Eliot Street, Mansfield
Street, Pond Street, Everit Avenue, Lawrence
Street, Webster Street, Kingsbury Street, Clark
Street, Clinton Street, Bishop Street,
Winthrop Street, Coburn Street, Bridges
Street Extension, Saucier Street, Naples
Street, Hilton Street, Pleasant Street, and New
York Avenue. 
101
Page 114
Town of Framingham
Construction continued on the new A Street
wastewater management facility. This facility
is expected to be operational in May 2012.
Rehabilitations of the Pleasant Street and
Grove Street Water Pump Stations
commenced and both projects are expected to
be completed in March 2012. Storm drain
system improvements included replacement
of over five thousand linear feet of pipeline
on Concord Street and Edgell Road and a
three foot by six foot box culvert crossing
Roaring Brook on Route 30 near the
Framingham /Southborough town line.
Major transportation projects included the
reconstruction of eighteen hundred linear feet
of roadway and twenty three hundred linear
feet of sidewalk on Water Street; the
reconstruction of twenty three hundred linear
feet of roadway and twenty nine hundred
linear feet of sidewalk and the installation of
three raised crosswalk tables on State Street;
and the resurfacing of forty six hundred linear
feet of roadway on Saint Lo Street,
Guadalcanal Road, and the southern portion
of Concord Street.
The Division also coordinated with the
MassDOT to advance several bridge projects.
Construction was substantially completed on
the Fountain Street and Danforth Street
bridge replacement projects and designs
progressed for the replacement or
rehabilitation of the Winter Street Bridge over
the CSX Railroad, the Central Street Bridge
over the Sudbury River in Saxonville and the
Wickford Road Bridge over the Sudbury
River. MassDOT is scheduled to bid the
construction for the Winter Street, Central
Street, and Wickford Road Bridge projects in
mid to late 2012.
In 2011, eighteen design projects were
advanced, six to completion. Significant
ongoing design work includes sewer capacity
improvements downstream of the Technology
Park and transportation and streetscape
improvements in the downtown area. The
Division is pursuing grant funding over and 
2011 Annual Report
above the $ 12.9 million already obtained
through the Massachusetts Life Sciences
Center ( MLSC) to continue infrastructure
improvements necessary to support additional
economic development in the Technology
Park and has secured almost $5 million in
federal funds for the downtown
transportationimprovements. The Division
is also advancing the permitting necessary to
reactivate theBirch Roadwell field. This
effort includes working with the United States
Geological Survey (  USGS) to refine a
sophisticated groundwater model.
While the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) delayed the release of the new
NPDES Phase II Stormwater permit, the
Division continued its planning efforts based
on the requirements contained in the draft
version ofthatpermit. Work included outfall
testing and inspections, public education and
outreach, and quantifying the resources
staffing and funding) that will be necessary
for compliance if the terms of the final permit
are consistent with those in the draft version
that the EPA promulgated. Alsocompleted
was the second phase of a comprehensive
town -wide Stormwater Master Plan.
In addition to updating the GIS system to
capture the significant amount of construction
work completed by DPW, the Division also
assisted several other departments in 2011.
These included the School Department with
elementary school enrollment mapping, the
Town Clerk's office with the 2010 Census
redistricting process, the Board of Health with
environmental action mapping, and the
Middlesex District Attorney's office in
support of several school /park zone drug
cases.
The Division continued the document
scanning efforts initiated in 2010. In 2011, six
thousand additional historic paper records
were scanned and inventoried.
The Division reviewed three hundred and
forty seven plan submittals received either
102
Page 115
Town of Framingham
directly or routed to DPW from the Building
Department, Planning Board or Zoning
Board of Appeals; and processed four
hundred and ninety seven Street Opening
Permits and three hundred and eighty three
Trench Opening Permits.
HIGHWAY MANAGEMENT
PROGRAM
The Highway Division is responsible for the
maintenance and repair of the Town' s
roadway and sidewalk infrastructure including;
pavement markings, granite and bituminous
curbing, street and regulatory signage,
Stormwater utilities, traffic islands and public
shade trees.
Stormwater Management
The Stormwater Management System consists
of more than 200 miles of surface and
subsurface drainage systems, 12,200 catch
basin and manhole structures, and more than
600 drainage outfalls. 2011 construction
projects completed by Town and contracted
personnel included the installation of 290
linear feet of new drain line, stormwater pipe
and catch basin installation on Waverley
Street, drainage system installation on Spring
Street, as well as the repair of 104 drainage
structures and cleaning of 105,000 feet of
drain line. 1,550 feet of drain channels were
dredged by the State Trust Agency for
mosquito control and 277 drainage structures
were repaired or adjusted in conjunction with
the Capital Road Program. The Division also
upgraded the drainage system at the Western
Ave Public Works Facility by installing 160
feet of drain line and a precast headwall. The
Division has instituted a monthly inspection
process in its proactive drainage structure
maintenance program.
The Division is responsible for maintaining,
inspecting and operating the Town's
Saxonville flood levee system which consists
of 2,550 feet of earth dikes, 1,340 feet of
concrete flood walls, 1,000 feet of channel
realignment, a  pumping station, interior
drainage and a vehicular flood gate. 
2011 Annual Report
In order to maintain compliance with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's
Stormwater Phase II Permit, the Highway
Division made a vigorous year -long effort to
visit and clean catch basins utilizing both
Town crews, as well as contracted services, to
remove silt, sand, and debris from
approximately 5,680 catch basins. Over 1,295
tons of catch basin debris was removed from
catch basins and hauled to an accepting
facility by Town equipment and personnel.
The storm drain cleaning program has
continued to produce a significant repair list
as the inspection process progresses. The
Beaver Dam Brook and Hop Brook continue
to be significant operational challenges for the
Division as even modest rain events may
cause the brooks to surcharge at the many
culvert headwalls in both South Framingham
and the Gregory Road and McAdams areas of
North Framingham. The deficiencies in the
stormwater systems throughout the Town are
a major cause of unscheduled overtime and
emergency repair cost incurred by the Town.
In an effort to minimize the amount of sand
entering and further diminishing the capacity
of the system, the Division has continued
strict control practices for the use of de -icing
materials during the winter months. In
addition, an aggressive and comprehensive
post -winter street and sidewalk cleaning
program is performed annually to remove as
much sand as possible from the streets and
thereby minimize the opportunity for
accumulation in the drainage system.
The Division performs a comprehensive town
wide street cleaning routine as 
well as
overnight sweeping in the streets and
sidewalks of the commercial areas to
minimize the entry of materials into the
drainage system and to provide a cleaner
environment in the downtown area. The
removal of sand and debris from the Town' s
catch basins and manholes remains an
operational priority each year. 
103
Page 116
Town of Framingham
Pavement Management
The 2011 road program addressed more than
18 lane miles of roadways in the Town. The
construction projects included the
replacement or upgrade of roadway elements
and appurtenances so that both regulatory
guidelines and directives continued to be
adhered to and visual enhancements could be
made. New pavement markings, street signs,
sidewalks, granite and bituminous curbing,
wheelchair ramps and curb -cut control
measures were addressed during construction.
Through the integration and management of
specialized contracted equipment with in
house resources, the Division repaired over 3
miles of deficient roadways through a milling
and paving method. The development of this
program has led to greater cost control,
quality control, and accountability while
performing repair work on defective
roadways. The strategy and design behind this
program had drawn the attention of other
large communities in the Commonwealth. In
addition, the Division responded to
emergency repairs, preventive maintenance,
and filled over 10,000 potholes in 2011. The
Division has replaced 2,640 linear feet of
defective guardrails through this ongoing,
state financed (Chapter 90),road program.
Winter Storm Management
The Highway Division is responsible for the
provision of a safe automotive and pedestrian
environment both during and after winter
storm events. This effort involves the plowing
and treating of 550 lane miles of public
roadway, 36 municipal parking facilities, 77
miles of sidewalks and public pathways, 183
crosswalks, 187 cul -de -sacs and 31 school
crossing -guard stations and student drop -off
areas. Snow and ice operations are among the
most important of responsibilities charged to
the Department of Public Works. No activity
performed by a  Town entity encompasses
more uncontrollable factors, nor has a greater
impact on the community than does that of
the proper handling of snow and ice events. 
2011 Annual Report
Those factors include weather, the amount of
snowfall, rate of snowfall, duration of the
storm, and type of precipitation. Not only do
these factors have to be considered, their
impact on resources and costs, including
manpower, equipment, and materials must be
understood and appropriately managed.
The Division has integrated the Town's
Geographical Information System ( GIS) with
an Incident Command Structure to manage
each event. The purpose of this strategic
effort is  to provide a  high level of
accountability while applying the appropriate
amount of resources to each storm event. In
order to be fiscally responsible, the
Department has developed a strategy to focus
on main roads with greater speeds and higher
traffic volumes, while utilizing a measured
response on secondary roads, making them
safe and passable.
All town spreader trucks are equipped with a
computerized distribution system that
operates according to ground speed, thus
ensuring the uniform distribution of de -icing
materials.
Tree Warden & Forestry Management
The Highway Division is responsible for the
maintenance management of the Town's
estimated 12,000 public shade trees and for
the development of a  Public Shade Tree
program for the community. The purpose of
this program is to promote, preserve, and
enhance the shade tree environment of the
community through the application of best
management practices and public education
campaigns. The Town of Framingham was
named a Tree City USA again in 2011 by the
Arbor Day Foundation. This designation
provides a framework for public education, a
positive public image and citizen pride.
The Highway Division oversees the Town's
vegetation management program that is
permitted annually by the Massachusetts
Department of Agricultural Resources
Pesticide Bureau. This program allows the
104
Page 117
Town of Framingham
Department to apply best management
practices for the control of curbside
vegetation that otherwise would grow
uncontrollably and require the commitment of
substantial and sustained labor to control
unwanted growth.
A primary and recurring function of this
operating group is the statutory requirement
to maintain minimum clearance over the 550
lane -mile roadway network. In 2011, 58 miles
of pruning were completed to provide
clearance and safetravellanes. TheTown's
shade trees, while providing a great public
amenity to the Town, require routine
maintenance so that they do not also become
a public liability. The tree crew performs an
annual town -wide survey to  identify
hazardous trees and diseases and undertake
corrective follow -up actions. These steps
reduce potential tree related damage and
emergency responses during weather events.
In the event of severe weather, such as 2011's
Tropical Storm Irene and the October 29 -30
snow storm, the Division is responsible for
the cleanup and removal of storm debris.
Those storms in particular destroyed
hundreds of trees requiring removal.
Thousands of others were injured or
compromised that require present and future
attention. The Division was responsible for
two curbside brush collections provided for
residents following these events.
The Tree Warden conducts frequent
hazardous tree assessments, prescribes
treatment, oversees removals, and participates
in public hearings on issues related to trees
within the right of way. The Department
routinely responds to residents' inquiries and
requests for service, and Forestry
Management personnel removed 161 dead,
diseased, and /or hazardous street trees in
2011.
Traffic Systems Management
The Traffic Systems section of the Highway
Division manages the maintenance,
fabrication, and placement of the Town's 
2011 Annual Report
regulatory and street signage, steel -beam
safety guardrail, installation of new and annual
maintenance of existing pavement markings,
and the work zone safety program for
Division operations. This section is
responsible for advance planning of traffic
management coordination for roadway
construction, as 
well as 
for the
implementation of  by-  street -  street "  no
parking" postings required to efficiently
advance the street sweeping program. The
pre -planning for traffic management during
the construction season maximizes the
efficient production of the work, and also
contributes to a 
safe environment for
motorists and work crews alike.
The Traffic Systems section managed the
annual contract and divisional painting of 81
miles of yellow centerline, 93 miles of white
edge line, over 700 crosswalks, 771 stop bars,
and 362 arrows throughout the Town.
The Division installed and or replaced
hundreds of regulatory signs and advisory
signs either by direction of the Board of
Selectmen, the Traffic and Roadway Safety
Committee, or as required through routine
maintenance practices.
SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT
PROGRAM
Solid Waste Management
The Solid Waste Management Program is
responsible for the management and oversight
of the Town's Solid Waste and Recycling
Programs. Materials are collected by means of
curbside and containerized collection
programs, the leaf and yard waste drop -off
area and the operation of a 
Resource
Recovery Center located on Mt. Waste Ave.
The Division manages the collection of refuse
and recycling from 19,508 dwelling units
weekly, averaging more than 3,900 curbside
collection stops and 90,000 pounds per day
collected curbside. 
105
Page 118
Town of Framingham
During 2011 the Town experienced two
major weather events; Hurricane Irene and
the OctoberNor'easter. Among otherthings,
these storms resulted in major tree damage
throughout the community. As a result, in
conjunction with the Highway Division, two
special town wide curbside brush and tree
limb collections were performed. This allowed
residents to remove tree waste storm debris
from theiryards. The two divisions collected,
managed, and recycled close to 70,000 cubic
yards of tree waste. By comparison, the
division managed 1,700 cubic yards of similar
material at the Dudley Road Yard Waste
Facility during 2010 in its entirety.
July 1, 2011 marked the transition of
contractors providing our curbside recycling
service. This also marked the change to an
every other week recycling collection
schedule. This change resulted in a
200,00000. savings in the FY2011 budget.
While the recycling is now collected on an
alternating week schedule, the use of the
recycling carts has continued to allow for
increased recycling participation and trash
reduction. On average, in 2011 the typical
homeowner recycled fifty pounds more per
year and disposed of 90 pounds less trash per
year over 2010. This resulted in an additional
trash disposal cost avoidance of $60,000.
Since the initial cart distribution many home
owners have requested to enlarge the capacity
of their cart. To date, the division has
satisfied close to 1,800 service requests from
residents to exchange their cart to the larger,
96 gallon, size.
The radio frequency cart identification system
RFID) is now fully functional. Thisallows
the town to track what home carts are
assigned to, how often and what time of day
theyare serviced. This hasbecome avaluable
tool for the town to maintain contractor
accountability ensuring the proper delivery of
service has been performed. 
2011 Annual Report
The division has continued to employ a multi
facetted approach to decrease the Town's
overall trash disposal costs. Some of these
approaches included:
1. The attainment of waste reduction grants
from the Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection (MassDep).
2. In April 2011, the division sought and
was awarded a $100,000 Municipal Grant
from MassDep's Sustainable Materials
Recovery Program ( SMRP).This grant
was specifically earmarked to reduce the
town's cost for the purchase of the
wheeled recycling carts.
2011 is the second year of a MassDep
Pilot program grant sought by the division
for the elimination of Styrofoam lunch
trays and food composting in the public
schools. Currently, Barbieri Elementary
has installed dishwashing machines and is
utilizing reusable lunch trays. This change
has allowed the division to cut trash
disposal cost by 50 percent at that school.
We are in the process of updating and
installing efficient dishwashing machines
at two other schools to continue the
elimination of the Styrofoam trays in the
district.
3. Starting in July 2011 the Resource
Recovery Center began selling natural
mulch and compost to homeowners and
landscapers at a reduced rate. This helped
reduce disposal cost, raise additional
revenues for the town, and create a full
circle recycling loop. The division has
provided these materials for various town
projects such as creating a garden at the
high school, as a  soil amendment in
athletics fields, landscaping at the Village
Hall and has been used at the Resource
Recovery Center itself. These materials are
provided at no cost to other town
departments allowing them significant
financial savings.
4. Public Education -  2011 continued our
themed monthly events and programs.
These events and services are offered to
residents atno additional cost. These
106
Page 119
Town of Framingham
include Household Hazardous Waste Day,
the Earth Day Celebration and the Town
Wide Green -Up Day. Our most popular
events continue to be the Shred Fest
secure confidential document shredding)
and Electronics Day. Furthermore, the
electronics take -back day has allowed the
town to donate hundreds of pounds of
non -perishable food to local food pantries
as participating residents are encouraged
to make a donation. This has also helped
the Town to properly recycle and dispose
of thousands of pounds of discarded
electronics.
The Resource Recovery Center (RRC) located
on Mount Waste Ave has continued the
tradition of providing quality service to
residents. In 2011 the division had robust
sticker sales issuing 6,898 permits to residents
providing access to the solid waste and
recycling services offered at the facility. The
center continues to  provide excellent
customer service at reduced costs to the
residents as well as generate a  significant
revenue stream. The Town continues to
partner with the Town of Wellesley, the Town
of Needham and private entities in the
marketingofrecyclables. Thishasalloweda
greater revenue stream to be produced for the
recyclables received. Through fees collected
for divisional services and marketing of the
recyclables during CY2011, $229,84945.was
generated for the General Fund.
In 2011 the town continued to enjoy the
successes derived by making it easier for
residents to recycle. In addition to the
hazardous and hard to manage wastes
collected at the RRC, the center collected
373.39 tons of recyclables. Curbside
recyclables collected totaled 4,23707. tons
358.83 tons higher than 2010).  This
represented an overall trash disposal cost
avoidance of $462,42.336.
WATER AND WASTEWATER
MANAGEMENT PROGRAM 
2011 Annual Report
The Water and Wastewater Program is
responsible for the provision of a drinking
water supply, a fire suppression service, and a
sewer collection service to the 70,000
residents of the community that it serves.
The Water Department is responsible for the
distribution of a public potable water supply
and for the provision of fire suppression
service to the 17,000 residential and
commercial accounts within the community.
The average daily water demand of nearly
seven million gallons per day (  mgd) is
purchased from the Massachusetts Water
Resources Authority (  MWRA) and is
subsequently distributed throughout the
Town by means of a complicated system of
pumps, pipes, valves, andreservoirs. The
Water Department program provides for the
maintenance and repair to the water
distribution infrastructure that includes; 250
miles of pipe, 17,000 service connections,
2,000 hydrants, 4,800 gate valves, 22,000
meters, 4  pumping stations, 3  booster
stations, and 6 above ground water tanks
having a storage capacity of nearly 9 million
gallons.
The Wastewater Department is responsible
for the collection and transport of 5 -10
million gallons of sewage 
each day. A
significant portion of wastewater flow during
peak periods is infiltration and inflow J /I)
from sources such as leaking pipes and sump
pump discharges during wet weather. Sewage
is conveyed from town systems to the MWRA
which is charged with the transport and
treatment of sewerage from its forty -three
member communities. The town's collection
system consists of 226 miles of gravity mains,
18 miles of force mains, 50 pump stations,
6,600 manholes, and over 40 miles of cross -
country sewer -line easements.
The Division's capital improvement programs
have been substantially under - funded in
recent decades and, as a consequence, the
critical infrastructure has experienced ever
increasing incidents of failure. The system
107
Page 120
Town of Framingham
continued to grow and expand over time, but
the funding for the aging and expanding
infrastructure did not keep pace with capital
needs. As a consequence, the Division was
historically engaged solely in performing
unscheduled maintenance and was unable to
devote resources to  perform critical
maintenance to  the system. This is
underscored by the issuance of an
Administrative Consent Order ( ACO) and
Notice of Noncompliance by the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection ( MADEP) during March 2007.
The ACO requires the Town to undertake
major sewer construction and rehabilitation
projects over several years with the primary
focus of alleviating reoccurring sanitary sewer
overflows, a violation of State and Federal
law. The ACO has several other requirements
including increased staffing levels, major
equipment purchases, implementation of a
SCADA system to remotely monitor and
control pumping stations and strict reporting
requirements. It is anticipated that the key
components of the ACO will be completed
on schedule by the end of 2013. Failure to
comply with the conditions of the ACO can
result in administrative civil or criminal action.
The Department also faces the continuing
challenges of managing a 
second
Administrative Order originally issued by the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority in
2003. The MWRA Settlement Agreement
limits the level of sulfide that the Town is
authorized to discharge to the MWRA system
through operational efforts. Sulfide generation
can cause odor and corrosion problems in
sewers which sometimes can be catastrophic.
Activities which the Wastewater Department
performs to mitigate the generation of sulfide
include chemical dosing at  selected
wastewater pumping stations, targeted
collection system cleaning and inspection, and
enforcement of  grease interceptor
requirements at food establishments. A major
cause of sulfide is the wastewater detention
time associated with the 50 pumping stations
and 19 miles of related sewer force main 
2011 Annual Report
sewer. TheDepartment plans oneliminating
up to eight wastewater pumping stations and
related force mains over the next several years
as part of its Capital program.
In recent years the Department of Public
Works has developed a  professional and
knowledge workforce at all levels and
disciplines. This progression has provided an
opportunity to identify and fully carry out
capital projects of limited scope from design
through construction using Public Works
staff. This practice not only provides the
Town with a  significant cost savings over
contracting for these services but is used as a
tool for continually training our employees.
During 2011 approximately 2,675 feet of
water and /or sewer infrastructure was
replaced using this approach in Freeman
Street, Davis Street, Milton Street, Torrey
Street, Broderick Drive, and Wood Avenue.
The aforementioned construction activities
were in addition to the excavations required
by department staff to repair over 205 water
system failures and 122 sewer system failures
during the course of the year. Additionally the
Water and Wastewater Division responded to
over 1,900 first response calls and replaced 30
fire hydrants. The Wastewater division,
performed video inspection of over 119,000
linear feet of sewer pipe whereby the
condition of the sewer is documented using a
camera unit which is remotely controlled and
travels through the pipe. The inspection
process reveals areas of the system that have
actual or potential problems that may require
repair or replacement.
Twice each year the Water Department
Collects drinking water samples from fifteen
homes which are subsequently analyzed for
their lead content. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency has set the action level for
lead in drinking water at 15 parts per billion
ppb), the level which triggers corrective
actions to be undertaken by the water
supplier. The results of our sampling program
have successfully met that goal once again
1:

Town of Framingham
during 2011 as they have for the past several
years.
The Water Department also performs
approximately 900 bacteriological tests
annually to ensure the quality and protection
of the Town's drinking water. The Town
maintained continuous compliance
throughout the year with the Environmental
Protection Agency's standards related to
bacteria testing (Total Coliform Rule).
CONSERVATION COMMISSION
The Conservation Commission Office is
responsible for implementing local, state, and
federal wetland laws, managing over 400 acres
of conservation land, and engaging the public
in conservation efforts.
The Conservation Office is responsible for

Space for 2011 by signing two Conservation
Restrictions, working with other departments
to successfully receive a grant application for
the acquisition of Eastleigh Farms, and
acquired approximately 12 acres of new open
space by 618 Grove Street. In addition, the
Framingham Conservation Commission' s
Stewards continuously maintained
Conservation Lands by cutting vegetation that
overgrew onto the trails, and cleaning debris.
The Stewards also informed staff of any issues
with Conservation Land. Due to the severe
weather events experienced in 2011 the
Commission coordinated with the Highway
Department to alleviate trail hazards to keep
lands open to the public
3. Educational Achievements: The
Conservation Office held three events for
education and outreach purposes. The
Conservation Office supported Earth Day
which was held by the Framingham Sierra
109
Page 122
Town of Framingham
Club. The Conservation Office had a table at
the  event explaining Conservation
Commission jurisdiction, public land, and
their roles in the Town. In addition, the
Conservation staff  ran  a
Geocaching /Letterboxing event which had
over 40 participants on September 24, 2011.
Informational clues geared toward
conservation and sanitation themes were
created for children participating in the event.
The Conservation Office ran a stewardship -
oriented event at Riverfest Qune 2011),where
there was a canoe ride showing the resource
area ( Sudbury River), and a Nature Walk
where Commissioner Pam Helinek walked
through the trail and pointed out plant species
and their properties (  i.e. edible, medicinal
purposes, etc).
4. Administrative Achievements: The
Conservation Commission works closely with
DPW, Park and Recreation Dept., Planning
Board, Building Dept., and Community and
Economic Development to  ensure
compliance with state and local wetland laws.
Conservation Commission Staff works closely
with several local organizations such as
Sudbury Valley Trustees, New England
Wildflower Society, Bay Circuit Trail Alliance,
SuAsCo Wild and Scenic River Stewardship
Council, Massachusetts Department of
Conservation and Recreation, Massachusetts
Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, and the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection, to protect the Town's wetland
resource areas and open space.
FLEET, FACILITIES AND
COMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM
The Fleet, Facilities and Communications
program continues to provide a  critical
support service to various Public Works'
programs and also provides vehicle and
equipment maintenance support to other
agencies within the Town. This Program is
accountable for; the development and
implementation of  professional fleet
management standards and practices, the
design and procurement of all public works 
2011 Annual Report
vehicles and equipment, and for providing
standardized maintenance management
practices for all public works facilities
including water, wastewater and pumping
stations. The Division is also charged with the
technical management
telecommunications network 
of
and 
the
thereby
provides a critical service component to the
Department's Emergency Management
Response Plan.
The Fleet, Facilities, and Communications
Division's role is to provide logistical support
to the Department through the provision of
fully operational equipment, facilities and
telecommunications that together, ensure the
effective and efficient delivery of essential
services to the residents of the community.
These vital services include the provision of
public safety, public works, and public utility
functions for the residents of Framingham.
This year we were able to upgrade the Town's
emergency channel 3 with digital capabilities
which will give the Town of Framingham's
Emergency Management Agency full
interoperability and provide a  secure link
between department heads and managers in
the event of a public communication system
breakdown. This was accomplished with grant
money from the Framingham Police
Department.
The Town continues to be one of three major
equipment and materials cache sites for the
Northeast Homeland Security Regional
Advisory Council ( NERAC). In the fall of
2011 the cache site's equipment was utilized
during the Tropical Storm state of emergency.
Flood pumps were delivered to the
Massachusetts Emergency Management
Agency ( MEMA),a light tower was delivered
to  the Town of Sherborn and a
communications tower was delivered and set
up for the Town of Stow. Also, one of the
large standby generators was used at our
pump stations due to various power outages
throughout the Town. The Highway Division
110
Page 123
Town of Framingham
utilized one of NERAC's wood chippers to
help with the Town -wide cleanup.
Fleet Management
In 2011 the Division researched, designed and
prepared specifications for the procurement
of the following specialized equipment: One
brush chipper, two sidewalk tractors for snow
removal, a large self -contained snowblower,
two 40,000 GVW snow fighting trucks with
sanders, front plows, center scrapers and wing
plows. Also included were four heavy duty
pickups with plows, two medium duty dump
trucks with plows, six heavy duty utility body
trucks with plows, a heavy duty rack body
truck with a lift gate and plow, and a 72,000
GVW automated refuse packer with a plow.
Technician training sessions continue both in-
house and off site to help keep our
technicians current with the ever changing
industry.
This has been the fifth winter season that we
have setup a  temporary site at the King
School for technicians who are assigned to be
on the north side of town during plowing
events. This continues to work very well in
providing the technicians a more functional
area to work so repairs can be performed
more effectively and reducing the vehicle's
out of service' time that would occur
returning to the Western Avenue facility.
In 2011, Fleet Services wrote 2,204 repair
orders, performed 476 scheduled preventative
maintenance services and completed 166
Commonwealth of Massachusetts Registry of
Motor Vehicles Enhanced Emissions State
Inspections.
The Division also managed the acquisition &
distribution of more than 272,000 gallons of
gasoline & diesel fuel.
Facility Maintenance
Again this year the Department of
Environmental Protection's Stage II Vapor
Recovery Certification program was 
2011 Annual Report
performed for the fuel system at Western
Avenue along with the annual calibration of
the fuel pumps which was performed by the
Town's Sealer of Weights & Measurers. The
oil /water separators at Western Avenue and
the Mt. Wayte recycling facility continue to be
inspected quarterly and pumped out in
compliance with DEP regulations as needed
but at least annually. We continue to perform
full load tests on the emergency/ standby
generators at both the Western Avenue and
Henry Street facilities. This is done quarterly
to ensure proper operation along with a semi-
annual maintenance program. The annual fire
sprinkler inspection was performed at the
Western Avenue facility.
During the winter the roof on the recycling
storage building at the Mount Wayte facility
was compromised due to the amount of snow
that had fallen. This building was condemned
and was removed. A new storage facility was
constructed in its place and was ready for
occupancy by December 1. The cost of this
facility was covered by the Town's insurance.
We have completed the replacement of the
yard lighting at the Western Avenue facility.
The lighting units were replaced with energy
efficient LED pole lights. This replacement
program was partially funded through an
NSTAR grant.
The Spill Prevention Control and
Countermeasure Plans ( SPCCP) are reviewed
annually to insure accuracy. This plan is
necessary so there are guidelines in place to
respond to any type of uncontrolled release of
hazardous materials. This plan also includes
all of the town's pumping stations and the
Resource Recovery Center.
Fleet Services continues to do a monthly
inspection of the Watson Place flood station
and performs any necessary repairs.
ADMINISTRATION &  FINANCE
The Administration and Finance Division
provides for the consolidation of all
111
Page 124
Town of Framingham
administrative and financial functions within
the Department of Public Works. The
Division strives to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of financial and administrative
functions within the Department through the
use of professional practices.
The core mission of the Division of
Administration &  Finance is to provide
service and technical support to the major
Divisions within the Department of Public
Works: Engineering, Conservation, Highway,
Solid Waste, Fleet, Water and Wastewater as
well as providing other Town Departments
with information in a timely and accurate
manner.
The Division is also responsible for the
management of grant funding, as well as
federal reimbursement activities that are
related to storm emergencies and other
events.
Water and Sewer utility billings for the Town
of Framingham are also managed by this
Division. Staff issued approximately 73,000
bills in2011. Most residential customers in
Framingham are billed quarterly for water and
sewer usage, while commercial, industrial and
high volume customers are billed monthly.
The staff also administers the Senior Discount
and Utility Abatement policies on behalf of
the Board of Selectmen.
During 2011 this Division worked with the
Treasurer's Office and an outside vendor to
enhance the on line payment process for
residents. This new option was made
available to residents during 2011.
In July 2010 a new software system was
implemented for utility billing activities. 
2011 Annual Report
During 2011 Division staff completed the first
full year cycle of billing processes. This
robust software along with the benefits of the
automated meter reading ( AMR) system
greatly improved the efficiency and accuracy
Of utility billing and enhanced customer
service. The number of estimated bills
released by the department has declined
significantly since the AMR system success
rate consistently exceeds 99 %.
The AMR technology provides meter readings
for each property four times a day. This
feature has been an important tool in helping
customers understand their usage and identify
leaks. Itis also akeytoolinthe evaluation of
abatement requests.
Three federal emergency declarations were
issued during 2011: a January snow event, the
August Tropical Storm Irene emergency and
the  October "  Halloween Storm ".
Reimbursement of $291k was received from
Federal Emergency Management
Administration (  FEMA) for the January
event. TheDepartment has submitted costs
to FEMA for the August event totaling
102,07. 288. Department staff continues to
work with FERIA representatives on the
Halloween storm.
Members of the department oversee the
Drain Layer License renewal process and the
processing of personnel related activities for
the 150 members of the Public Works
Department as well as the processing of
thousands of vendor invoices.

Town -wide Master Plan 
116
Page 129
Town of Framingham
In relation to preparation of a Master Plan,
M.L, G.Chapter 41 §81D states, "A planning
board established in a city or town or such
part or parts thereof as said board may deem
advisable and from time to time may extend
or perfect such plan ".  In 2007, the Board
began the development of Framingham's first
comprehensive Master Plan since 1988.
The Board completed the first phase of the
Master Plan and published the Baseline
Conditions Report, which is available online.
The commencement of the second phase of
the Master Plan was delayed, due to lack of
funding. Town Meeting approved the
appropriation of unassigned mitigation funds
to complete the Master Plan.
The final draft of Master Plan Land Use is
under review. The Board has engaged the
Cecil Group to complete the plan. The Master
Plan is anticipated to be presented at the
Spring 2012 Annual Town Meeting.
Comprehensive Improvement Plan for the
Framingham Technology Park
The Board, as a condition of their site plan
approval for Genzyme's Biologics Support
Center and with the agreement of Genzyme
Corporation, initiated a planning process to
develop a comprehensive improvement plan
forthe Framingham Technology Park. The
Board engaged Terra Tech Rizzo to provide
develop theplan. The planning process is a
collaborative effort between town officials
and park owners and tenants.
The plan evaluates the sufficiency of current
infrastructure to  meet the forecasted
development needs and will explore options
for substantially upgrading the appearance of
the Park in a comprehensive and cohesive
manner. The plan will, in a specific way,
provide an overall vision for the Framingham
Technology Park and define expectations
related to streetscape elements such as
lighting, signage, pedestrian accommodations
and landscaping so that as the Park is
upgraded through public grants or private 
2011 Annual Report
initiatives it is done in a manner consistent
with a documented plan. Theplanaddress
broader issues related to transportation and
utility infrastructure and emergency services in
a more general way, focusing on identifying
current and future system deficiencies and
potential solutions. Thedraftplanwasissued
in 2010 and the final plan was issued October
21, 2011.
Planning Board Rules and Regulations
Article 18: Landscape Design Guidelines
In 2011, the Board updated their Rules and
Regulations to include Article 18: Landscape
Design Guidelines. Article 18 was adopted by
the Board to aid developers in the proper
landscape plant selection and to guide the
landscape design process. Included in Article
18 are plant recommendations for tree,
shrubs, groundcovers, and rain gardens; in
addition to an example landscape schedule,
special landscape notes, and a  landscape
maintenance schedule integrated turf grass

Through the Mass in Motion/ Community
Transformation Grant, the Town of
Framingham will be working in collaboration
117
Page 130
Town of Framingham
with the communities of Hudson and
Marlborough to create incorporate healthy
communities initiative town or city. The
purpose of the Community Transformation
Grant is to implement policy, systems and
environmental change strategies to increase
healthy eating and active living. CTG
strategies need to include broader policy,
environmental, programmatic or
infrastructure changes to promote health
rather than an emphasis on programs.
In 2011, the Planning Board wrote a letter of
support for the Board of Health to support
the work efforts involved in a  healthy
communities transformation. In 2012 the
Planning Board will work in collaboration
with the Framingham Board of Health, City
of Marlborough, and the Town of Hudson to
incorporate the goals of the grant into the
Town.
Framingham Downtown Renaissance
The Planning Board has actively been
involved in the efforts to  revitalize
Downtown Framingham, through the
Framingham Downtown Renaissance (FDR).
The Planning Board provides FDR with
technical assistance needed to ensure that the
goals of FDR are met. The Planning Board
has attended the monthly Thursday morning
meetings in the Town Hall, provided staff to
sit on various committees related to FDR, and
provided technical documents to help guide
future development and reinvestment in the
Downtown area.
Route 9 Route 9 MetroWest Smart Growth
Plan- Sustainable Communities
Consortium
In 2011, the Planning Board wrote a letter of
support for  MetroWest Regional
Collaborative ( MAPC) for a Smart Growth
Plan Grant; MAPC was awarded this grant
and will start work on the Route 9 Plan in
2012. The scope of the plan includes a
collaboration effort between Framingham,
Natick, Southborough, and Wellesley on a
Route 9. The Route 9 plan would further 
2011 Annual Report
develop the recommendations outlined in a
recently completed Route 9 Corridor Analysis
which determined that the development
potential of the Route 9  corridor under
current zoning could result in almost doubling
the current floor area, severely exacerbating
traffic congestion. The study suggested that
future development on Route 9  should
include more mixed pedestrian and bicycle
friendly environment. The planning concept is
to create denser Smart Growth Opportunity
Areas that could also be better served by
public transportation and generate fewer
automobile trips than the current
development pattern.
ADMINISTRATION
The Board has continued to work with the
Town Treasurer' s Office to  require
prospective developers to obtain certification
from the Town's Treasurer /Tax Collector
that no local taxes, fees, assessments or other
municipal charges are outstanding prior to
submission ofanapplication. Asaresultof
this process, many applicants have been
obligated to bring unsettled accounts up to
date before the Board would consider their
developmentproposals. Sincefirstemployed
in May of 1993, this noteworthy process has
been a source of substantial uncollected taxes
for the Town. By the end of calendar year
2011 over $2.4 million had been collected to
date through these efforts.
In calendar year 2011, the Board collected a
total of $21,00234.in revenue from associated
project review fees and from the sale of
Zoning By -Laws, Zoning Maps, Subdivision
Rules and Regulations, and minor
miscellaneous revenues. The projects
reviewed by the Board will create hundreds of
construction jobs. In addition to actual off -
site improvements constructed by project
applicants, the Planning Board has also
collected off -site improvement obligations in
the amount of $3.758M through calendar year
2011 according to our most recent financial
report. Upon occupancy of these projects,
118
Page 131
Town of Framingham
the net increase in positive tax flow to the
Town is estimated upwards of $7 million.
In addition to these contributions to the
General Fund, the Planning Board obtains
significant Town -wide amenities through the
process of negotiated mitigation. In the
course of its review the Planning Board
requires applicants to provide improvements
such as roadway widening and reconstruction,
signalization, enhancements for public
transportation and landscaping to offset
adverse projectimpacts. Through calendar
year 2011 the Board received $104,00000. in
direct mitigation performance guarantees and
Payments.
The Board continues to improve the website
to increase availability of the information to
the public. The Zoning By -Law and
Subdivision Regulations are available for
downloading and printing to make the
document more widely available to the public.
The Board continues to post on the website

The Community and Economic
Development Division (C &ED)
undertakes a wide variety of projects, all
of which are focused on protecting and
enhancing the quality of life for
Framingham's residents. The projects are
multi- dimensional, ranging from securing
grants and providing policy analyses to
promoting homeownership and
strengthening and expanding the tax base
by encouraging appropriate new
development.
The Division consists of three
departments: Planning, Zoning Board of
Appeals (ZBA),and Community
Development (CD).While each
department concentrates on different
planning functions, there are strong

PLANNING DEPARTMENT
The Planning Department concentrates
on promoting economic development and
supporting our residential neighborhoods.
Planners also manage a wide variety of
projects and provide policy analyses for
the Town Manager and Board of
Selectmen.
Economic Development
The department is  committed to
encouraging appropriate economic
development in order to support and
expand the tax base, thereby contributing
to the fiscal health of the town and
minimizing the tax burden on property
owners. Planners are responsible for
119
Page 132
Town of Framingham
Annual Report
implementing the Town's Economic
Development Strategic Plan, which is
based on the recognition of the critical
roles that the commercial sector plays in
improving the quality of life for residents
by contributing to the tax base, providing
employment opportunities, and making
available a diversity of goods and services.
Consisting of four interconnected
components, the Plan is directed at:
identifying and planning for key sites and
districts, facilitating Town investment to
establish a  framework for the private
sector, creating a  business friendly
environment, and marketing the town's
assets to attract new development and
redevelopment.
Downtown Revitalization
The Planning Department coordinates
ongoing and planned projects to revitalize
Framingham's central business district.
The department works closely with the
Town Manager, Department of Public
Works, Building and Wires Department,
and Planning Board as well as state,
regional and federal agencies and
legislators to insure that all projects are
moving forward in a  coordinated and
expeditious manner.
Underlying the Town' s approach to
improving the economic viability of
Downtown is the recognition that public
infrastructure improvements leverage
private investment. Publicinvestment is
directed at facilitating vehicular and
pedestrian circulation patterns, improving
safety, and beautifying the downtown as
well as upgrading water and sewer
infrastructure.
Working with DPW and its consultant as
well as the Town Manager, Board of
Selectmen and Planning Board staff, the
Planning Department has helped guide
the development of a  long -term 
2011
revitalization strategy for the downtown
that addresses the rail crossing issue, seeks
to incorporate Farm Pond into the
downtown, promotes mixed -use
development, significantly improves safety
and traffic flow, and enhances the physical
appeal of the downtown. The State is
currently undertaking an Environmental
Review of a long -term plan to introduce a
grade separation into the downtown.
The Town has also developed plans to
effect significant vehicular and pedestrian
improvements to address traffic flow and
improve safety in the more immediate
future. These plans, combined with major
streetscape improvements to beautify the
downtown and help entice visitors to the
district are nearing 25% completion at
which time the State will conduct a public
hearing to solicit input into the design
plans.
Framingham Downtown Renaissance
C &ED staff works collaboratively with
Framingham Downtown Renaissance
FDR),a non -profit organization focused
on the revitalization of our downtown.
With the support of the CD and Planning
Departments, FDR made significant
inroads this year in adapting the National
Trust for Historic Preservation' s Main
Street Program to the downtown. This
partnership has already generated tangible
results including an FDR- sponsored
survey of  downtown businesses
conducted by Framingham State
University students. FDR also
coordinated an  exciting "  winter
wonderland" event in the downtown
during the 2011 holiday season, which
attracted new visitors and consumers.
FDR posted a job description for a Main
Street Project Manager who will be hired
inthe spring of2012. The Project
Manager will be charged with aggressively
120
Page 133
Town of Framingham
Annual Report
furthering the goals of the Main Street
Program in support of the combined
efforts of FDR and C &ED to promote
real change in Framingham' s downtown.
In addition to staff support, C &ED is
contributing $ 30,000 in (  federal)
Community Development Block Grant
funds to help finance the Project
Manager's salary.
Neighborhood Commercial Areas
The Planning Department also focused
efforts on the partially vacant Nobscot
and Mt. Wayte shopping centers. The
Board of Selectmen tasked the Economic
Development Industrial Corporation
FDIC), staffed by the Planning
Department, to generate a development
plan for the Mt. Wayte shopping center.
C &ED is working with the Nobscot
neighborhood as well as the brokerage
firm recently hired to market Nobscot in
order to facilitate lease -up of the property.
Brownfields Project
Framingham has a considerable number
of brownfields, which are properties that
contain or potentially contain hazardous
substances, pollutants or contaminants
that complicate the property's refinancing,
expansion or redevelopment. Brownfields
are not only a blighting influence on their
surroundings, but are typically
underutilized, thereby representing
enormous potential to generate significant
new property taxes once they are abated
or it is established that that they are not
contaminated.
In prior years, the department secured
two EPA grants to identify, abate and
eventually redevelop brownfields. We
submitted an additional grant application
in2011. We continued toadminister the
previously awarded grants, which involves
targeting sites, interfacing property
owners, and working with a licensed site 
2011
professional (  LSP) hired by the
department to conduct environmental site
assessments (  ESAs) of  selected
properties. TheLSP hasundertaken nine
ESAs including two for the site on which
a new branch library is planned. One
noteworthy project entailed use of use of
Brownfields funds to assess a Parks and
Recreation Department parcel on Pratt
Street. The results allowed the Town, with
the support of the Agricultural Advisory
Committee, to establish a  community
garden in the summer of 2011.
Appropriate Economic Development
New development is one of the few
mechanisms available to expand the tax
base, thereby reducing the financial
burden on existing property owners
and /or increasing the availability of
funding to improve municipal services.
In recognition of the tremendous
potential of Technology Park, the
Planning Department works with
prospective developers and the State to
encourage and facilitate appropriate
development. The C &ED Director
participates in a quarterly meeting with
Tech Park property owners and tenants
together with other Town officials to
identify issues of mutual concern and how
we can strengthen our partnership to
address these issues and maximize the
economic potential of the area.
The department is also working to target
and promote the development of major
parcels for (re)development throughout
town. Although the lack of available
credit has seriously undermined the
progress of several private developments,
we are focused on creating a favorable
development environment and
encouraging redevelopment of vacant and
underutilized property in the downtown
and community -wide. 
121

Annual Report
Residential Neighborhoods
While economic development initiatives
support residential neighborhoods by
generating additional taxes, the Planning
Department also undertook projects that
were directed specifically at protecting and
improving Framingham' s neighborhoods.
The department continued to respond to
a Board of Selectmen policy that places a
priority on encouraging homeownership
and targeting efforts to vulnerable
neighborhoods. Both the Community
Development Block Grant and HOME
Programs are focused on improving
neighborhoods.
Neighborhood Stabilization Program
The dramatic increase in  home
foreclosures that began in 2008 persisted
in2011. The Planning Department
continued to  implement the
Neighborhood Stabilization Program
NSP),funded by three grants secured and
administered by C &ED totaling $ 1.35
million. The mission ofNSP is to acquire
and convert foreclosed properties into
owner -occupied homes to reduce the
potential for blight and help stabilize
neighborhoods.
The success of NSP represents the
combined efforts of the Planning
Department, CD Department and the
Board of Selectmen as well as the
Framingham Housing Authority ( FHA)
and its subsidiary, the Framingham
Housing Development Corporation.
Thus far, the Program has resulted in the
purchase of five homes, all of which have
been completely renovated and three of
which were sold to income -eligible
applicants in 2011. One two- family
property was retained by FHA and the
fifth property is currently for sale. Closing
on a sixth property is scheduled for the
spring of 2012. Net sale proceeds are 
2011
reinvested in the purchase and renovation
ofadditional properties. These renovated
properties have dramatically improved the
appearance of the neighborhoods in
which they are situated and returned
abandoned properties to active uses that
contribute positively to  the
neighborhoods in which they are situated.

Promotion
Interrelated with both the Economic
Development and Neighborhood Services
Strategic Plans, a  concerted effort is
underway to  market the desirable
attributes of Framingham in order to
encourage individuals, families and firms
to locate, invest, and shop in our town.
Planners have developed a  marketing
campaign, a major component of which is
a  web site created and maintained in
conjunction with Technology Services.
The two divisions will continue to refine
the web site, which can be accessed by
clicking on www.comchooseframinQham.
State and Federal Grants
The Planning Department constantly
identifies and analyzes the applicability of
grants as well as researches the availability
of funding for specific projects.
The department applied for $1.2 million
in grants during 2011. We successfully
received the following:
20,000
500,000

The extraordinary assistance and
cooperation provided by the school and
other municipal departments have been
instrumental in the department's success
in securing grants. Similarly, the Planning
Department is available to provide staff
support to other divisions in identifying
and preparing grant applications.
Policy Analyses, Studies, Project
Management, and Special Projects
C &ED undertakes projects, prepares
policy analyses, and coordinates inter-
departmental projects. Some of these
2011 projects include the following:
Wireless Communication Facilities
WCF) Working Group
The working group retained a consultant
in 2011 to review our WCF bylaw and
identify how the needs of the wireless
industry can be accommodated consistent 
2011
with federal law with the least impact to
our neighborhoods. The consultant's
report will be issued in February 2012.
Open Space Plan Implementation
Committee (OSPIC)
Planners staff the OSPIC, which is
charged with implementing the 2008 Open
Space andRecreation Plan. The committee's
first task was to update the 2008 action
plan. The committee also studied the
town's three aqueducts— Weston,
Hultman, and Sudbury —and assessed
how best to provide public access for
recreational use.
Transportation
C &ED works closely with DPW to insure
that Framingham's transportation
improvement priorities are identified on
the state's Transportation Improvement
Plan ( TIP),which is a prerequisite for
federal and state funding.
Cochituate Rail Trail (CRT
The Planning Department is working
closely with DPW to coordinate design
and construction activities along the rail
trail. Design plans for the trail were
submitted to MassDOT in 2011 and its
design review process is underway. The
department secured a $600,000 MassDOT
transportation grant in 2010 to help
complete the trail. The basic
infrastructure of the trail is  under
construction as part of DPW's East
Framingham Sewer Improvement Project.
It is anticipated that the CRT will be
completed in 2013.
C &ED also retained a  consultant to
develop the 25% design for the 500 Old
Connecticut Path /CRT intersection. A
decision on whether to proceed with this
design will be made in 2012. 
123

Bruce Freeman Rail Trail (BFRT
The Planning Department manages the
planning process to  develop the
Framingham component of the proposed
35 -mile rail trail that will extend from
Lowell to Framingham. Thedepartment
has been seeking grant funding and
working with the regional committee
representing all of the communities
through which the trail will traverse.
Aqueducts
Planners are actively engaged in
improving public access to the Weston
Aqueduct. Aseriesofmeetingstook
place in 2011 with Town, regional and
State officials. Itis anticipated that a pilot
project for a  segment of the Weston
Aqueduct in Saxonville will be initiated in
2012.
Subsidized Housing Inventory (SHI)
The Planning Department carefully
monitors the Town's status on the
Commonwealth' s Subsidized Housing
Inventory in order to insure that
Framingham' s subsidized housing units
are accurately and fully counted. The
Town's SHI remains in excess of 10 %,
which limits the applicability of Chapter
40B Comprehensive Permits ( subsidized
housing development that is not subject
to municipal Zoning Codes).
Provide Support to Town Committees
C &ED provides staff support to several
Town committees, including:
Economic Development Industrial
Corporation (  EDI L The EDIC is
charged with creating a pro -active capacity
to plan for and carry out economic
development activities.
Multiple Hazard Mitigation Planning
Group. The C &ED Director serves on 
2011
the committee, which consists of
representatives of various Town divisions
as well as citizens. The group is
responsible for  overseeing the
implementation of the Town's Multiple
Hazard Mitigation Plan, required by the
Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000.
Consistent with federal requirements, the
Group updated the Plan, which was
officially adopted by the Board of
Selectmen in 2011.
ZONING BOARD OF APPEALS
Memorial Building, Room B2 ( 508)532
5456 zba@govfrarninghamma.
The Zoning Board of Appeals ( ZBA) is
the Permit Granting Authority and the
Special Permit Granting Authority for
projects that do not meet the
requirements of the Town's Zoning
Bylaws. The ZBA's function is to
approve or deny requests for variances
and special permits, and issue findings
through the public hearing process by
determining if the required criteria, as
stated in the Zoning Bylaw, have been
met. The ZBA also administers the
Comprehensive Permit process for
affordable housing as set forth under
M.L. G.Chapter 40B.
The ZBA is  a  three - member Board
appointed by the Selectmen. In 2011, Full
Members of the Board were Philip R.
Ottaviani, Jr.,Chair; Susan S. Craighead,
Vice - Chair; and Stephen E. Meltzer,
Clerk. Karl Thober, Edward (  Ted)
Cosgrove, Robert Snider and Kevin
Gatlin served as Associate Members.
Eugene Kennedy, Assistant Director of
Community and Economic Development,
also serves as the ZBA Administrator.
Mr. Kennedy prepared the Board's
decisions and advised the Board on
procedural and other issues. Alice Clapper
continued her duties as Administrative
Assistant. Town Counsel advised the
124

generated a total of $35,850 of revenue
from May 24, 2011 through December 9,
2011. Under the old filing fee schedule,
revenue would have been $13,950 for a
difference of $21,900. ZBA filing fees
had not been increased by the Board of
Selectmen since April 2002.
Fifty -nine petitions were filed with the
ZBA office in 2011. Twelve petitions that
were filed in 2010 were decided in 2011.
These 71 cases represent 16% more than
the 61 cases processed in 2010.
Of the 71 cases heard in 2011, 17 were
requests for variances, 34 for special
permits, 8 for findings, 9 for variance and
special permits, and 3  appeals of the
decision of the Building Commissioner.
Variance and special permit requests
included those for relief from dimensional
requirements for: construction of, and
additions to, single family homes;
placement of sheds on residential
properties; construction of two -family
residences and automotive and restaurant 
2011
uses; and changes of use 
for local
businesses. Some of these filings were the
outcome of changes in zoning districts in
past years resulting in non -conforming
lots.
Three Associate Members presided over
sign appeal applications, with the fourth
Memberselected as 
theAlternate. Six
sign applications were filed in 2011.
The Board generally meets on the second
and fourth Tuesdays of every month at
7:00 P.M. in the Deborah D. Blumer
Community Hearing Room. Members of
the public are welcome and encouraged to
attend ZBA meetings.
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
AND HOME PROGRAMS
Since 1975, Framingham has received
over 20 million dollars in Federal
Community Development Block Grant
Program (CDBG) funds. The Town also
receives federal Home Investment
Partnership Act (HOME) funds, which
must be used exclusively for developing
and rehabilitating residential units. In
combination, the programs seek to: arrest
deterioration in the housing stock and
stabilize neighborhoods through financial
and technical rehabilitation assistance to
property owners; develop programs to
preserve and expand affordable housing
opportunities; eliminate architectural
barriers; improve Town -owned facilities
and infrastructure to prolong their useful
lives and stabilize eligible neighborhoods;
improve the quality of life for low and
moderate income residents through the
provision of social services; and
administer the programs effectively and
equitably to ensure that all members of
the community may participate in or
benefit from program activities. 
125
Page 138
Town of Framingham
Annual Report
The following summarizes several major
accomplishments during 2011:
Housing Rehabilitation Assistance
The program provides technical assistance
and CDBG /HOME loans for the
rehabilitation of substandard homes.
Three dwellings were repaired with loans
and related assistance services through the
provision of grants and loans to income -
eligible property owners (those with low
or moderate incomes or a majority of
tenants with low or moderate incomes) in
2011. An additional six properties are in
the process of receiving housing
rehabilitation loans. Administrative
support is provided to implement the
Neighborhood Stabilization Program,
which acquires, rehabilitates and sells
foreclosed property.
Homebuyer Assistance
The Town's Downpayment Assistance
Program provided homeownership
opportunities to two income -eligible
households with CDBG /HOME funds in
2011, in conjunction with the Division's
Neighborhood Stabilization Program.
Code Enforcement
CDBG provides funding to conduct code -related inspections of properties located in
eleven Census Block Groups, each with a
population that has predominantly low or
moderate incomes. Inspectional staff
with the equivalent of one full-time
position made possible by CDBG funds)
and one administrative staff person were
employed by the Building Department.
StaffspeaksSpanishandPortuguese. The
Building Department maintains a  data
base on inspectional findings and maps
where problems are occurring. During
the past program year, over 400
inspectional cases were initiated and
closed. 
2011
Public Facilities Improvements:
Accessibility Adaptations
CDBG grants continued to fund several
handicapped accessibility improvements
to Memorial Building, including athe
installation of a new, mobile ADA stage
lift in Nevins Hall. The program also
funded: reconstruction of Arsenal Street;
and construction of accessible sidewalks,
pathways and pedestrian crossings at the
Juniper Hill School.
CDBG funds were also used to upgrade
public parks and recreational facilities
including the installation of new lighting
and landscaping at Butterworth Park.
Facade & Sign Improvement Program
Assistance was offered to business and
property owners as well as merchants
located in and around Framingham's
central business district and surrounding
commercial core in order to undertake
fagade, signage, and storefront
improvements. One local business was
offered funds to renovate the fagade of a
historic structure; these improvements are
anticipated to be constructed in 2012.
Public Services
The following initiatives were undertaken
with CDBG funds to serve youth: a
summer employment and counseling
program (  Community Connections
Summer Work Program); and a special
program for high school students facing
issues that have impeded their ability to
learn and achieve ( Resiliency for Life).
Adult programs included: literacy training
Literacy Unlimited); English -as -a- Second
Language (Framingham Adult ESL Plus);
limited financial assistance to prevent
homelessness (  Homeless Prevention
Program) and referrals to health insurance
coverage and social services (MAPS Inc).
Over 430 individuals were served by the
activities.

This year has been transformative in many
ways for both MAPC and the region.
With an infusion of federal dollars
through HUD's Sustainable Communities
Regional Planning Grant, MAPC has been
honored and challenged with a  great
responsibility this year: to support and
showcase the best smart growth projects
and policies across Greater Boston, and to
serve those up as models for others across
the country. Notable projects that have
been funded by the Sustainable
Communities are:
The Regional Housing Plan and
Fair Housing Equity Assessment
will outline the region's housing
needs, link fair housing with a
broader set of regional issues, and
recommend housing development
and policy goals.
The Framingham Tech Park
Transportation Management Plan
will recommend investments in
transit, infrastructure, and
incentives to facilitate economic
development in an old industrial
park alongRoute 9. Goals include
improved access to employment
and a reduction of vehicle miles
traveled in the region. 
We are proud to report that 2011 was
another successful year for our work
under the District Local Technical
Assistance (DLTA) program, which is an
essential vehicle for helping communities
achieve more sustainable land use and
more effective localgovernance. DLTA
funding is provided by the Legislature and
Governor to help cities and towns to
collaborate regionally on housing,
economic development, and
environmental protectionprojects. The
funding can also be used to help
municipalities to coordinate and more
efficiently deliver local services. Thisyear,
MAPC funded 19 projects, 8 in land use
planning and 11 in municipal services.
MAPC Staff also worked with the
495 /MetroWest Development Compact
to help identify priority development and
preservation areas and significant
transportation and infrastructure
investments forthatregion. Weworked
with our neighbors to the west, the
Central Massachusetts Regional Planning
Commission, and other allied
organizations, to  hold community
meetings in almost 40 cities and towns,
127
Page 140
Town of Framingham
Annual Report
yielding both local and regional priorities
for both residential and economic growth,
as well as priority land for preservation
and protection. MAPCisworkingto
make sure commercial and residential
growth respects open space resources,
transportation networks, and water
resources in the region.
In 2011 we added two new divisions to
MAPC: energy and public health. We
now have several staff devoted exclusively
to providing technical assistance and
policy guidance to  bolster energy
efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions ( GHG),to help in the regional
development of renewable energy
resources, and to procure energy products
and service for groups of municipalities.
We hope this work will advance markets
for clean technology while reducing GHG
and dependence on fossilfuels. For
example, we brought together 14
communities to hire and Energy Services
Company ( ESCO) and we created a new
Local Energy Action Program to help
communities plan and implement local
clean energyprojects. Weespecially want
to thank the Barr Foundation for their
support of MAPC's energy work.
MAPC continued a  robust legislative
agenda in 2011, focusing on topics such as
transportation funding, zoning reform,
and pursuing a  more sound financial
footing for the Community Preservation 
2011
Act. With many allies, we achieved a
major success when Governor Patrick
signed into law legislation reforming
health insurance for municipal employees
on July 12, 2011. This law will help
dozens of municipalities to negotiate
savings on health care costs for their
employees andretirees. This lawstrikes a
balance that gives municipalities a chance
to manage their way through the fiscal
crisis while preventing layoffs and
ensuring high -quality health insurance for
all municipal employees and retirees.
Finally, as the discussion and debate
around the MBTA's struggling financial
picture takes shape, we are poised to
influence policy decisions and advocate
for key revenue changes as part of our
new Transportation Campaign. We've
hosted forums on transit funding
throughout the year and are planning
more as pending fare hikes approach for

The MetroWest RTA was created by a
vote of the Framingham and the Ashland
Boards of Selectman in December of
2006. By the summer of 2007, seven
additional communities had joined, a
budget and fares were put in place, and an 
Administrator was hired to oversee the
daily operation of the LIFT which had
been under the Framingham Planning
Department. MWRTA " fixed route"
service was then initiated on December
1",2007 with a new contracted provider
128

Town of Framingham
Annual Report
and 10 new buses obtained from Federal
and State grants. At the same time, the
MWRTA was paying the MBTA to
continue its RIDE service in the
Framingham and Natick area.
In 2008, the original Framingham LIFT
and the Natick Neighborhood bus routes
were integrated into a  unified transit
system. That year, Marlborough and
Southborough joined MWRTA,
expanding demand response service
delivery by 2,000 rides a month.
In 2009, the Authority, through a Federal
grant, expanded again to create a link to
the Woodland MBTA Station in Newton
Route #1) setting the stage for using the
Charlie Card system wide. Additionally,
the Authority took over the MBTA's
RIDE provision in Framingham and
Natick expanding again the demand
response provision by another 5,000 rides
a month.
In 2010, the Authority, using state and
federal funds, purchased and rehabilitated
a facility at 37 Waverly St. which will serve
as the "Hub" and maintenance depot for
the system. In 2011, Wellesley joined the
Authority as its 12` member. Additionally
the MWRTA began collaboration with
Framingham State University, supporting
a student operated system with capital and 
2011
training that is fully funded by the
University.
Route # 1, as mentioned above, is
MetroWest' s link to the MBTA' s Green
Line. Routes #2 and #3, which loop
entirely within Framingham, are the most
highly traveled routes; consistently
averaging over 4,000 rides a month. Route
4 connects Market Basket to the
Shopper's World /Mall area and provides
service to  the Beaver Street
neighborhood. Route #  5  connects
Framingham to Hopkinton, Route 6
connects Framingham to Holliston, and
Route # 7, which also consistently
averages over 4,000 rides a 
month,
connects Framingham to Southborough
and Marlborough. Route # 9 is  a
component of Route # 1 during the
commuter hours and runs exclusively on
Route 9 during the off commute hours.
The MWRTA will continue to build upon
the over 400,000 rides provided in FY10
by using technology, an emphasis on
customer service and the more effective
and efficient delivery of transportation
service. Forfurtherdetailsandforreal

The Annual Town Meeting voted for an
annual FY12 operating budget of $2,965340,
for Parks Administration, Maintenance and
Recreation. This amount allowed us to
resume the maintenance of the school athletic
fields which had been significantly curtailed
from previous budget reductions.
The Capital Budget Committee approved a
new F250 4x4 Pickup Truck to be used for
the daily maintenance of park projects
including the replacement of the docks for
Learneds Pond to be installed in 2012 and
new Tennis Lighting at Butterworth Park.
The lighting project was accomplished with
significant savings from the appropriated
amount thanks to the Keefe Technical School
Electrical Lab students completing the
infrastructure for the project. Currently, specs
are being developed for Furber Playground
improvements and for computerized
irrigation throughout the parks. Both projects
will be implemented in the spring of 2012.
Other tasks approved by the Board included
the opening of a new handicapped accessible
playground at Farm Pond; the completion of
Phase 4 at Cushing Park, and new signage at
various parks. We entered into a formal
written agreement with the School
Department to assist with school bus storage
needs at our Long's Athletic Complex.

The Department Mission Statement was
reviewed by the Board and modified to read
To create recreational opportunities,
preserve open space, manage public athletic
fields and parks, and administer recreation
programs for the population of Framingham."
The Parks and Recreation Department
received the 2011 Massachusetts Architectural
Access Board and Boston Society of
Architects Design Award at the State House
for incorporating handicapped accessibility
into the design of the new Bowditch Field
Athletic and Cultural Complex. In addition to
the 345 events scheduled at the Bowditch
complex, stadium events included the
American Cancer Society Relay for Life,
Marian High School's League Track Meet, and
the United Soccer Memorial Day Tournament
as well as a host of high school and college
athletic events. The Department is  still
holding payments on the General Contractor
until corrective masonry work is completed.
Beautification Projects were implemented
throughout the Town with the use 
of
volunteers. The most noticeable areas include
Route 30/126 Island, Jonathan Maynard
Building, Sax Dam, Old Burying Grounds and
Nobscot Park.
The Agricultural Committee was issued a
permit to establish a Community Garden at
the Pratt Street property. A new parking area
and water lines were installed with hopes to
implement a green space for the development
of a neighborhood garden. It is hoped the
132

Agricultural Committee will continue to utilize
this improved area for community gardening
opportunities.
The Department continues to be an economic
driver for our community. Our excellent
recreational facilities attract thousands of
people to sports activities and tournaments.
They in turn spend money in our stores,
hotels, gas stations, and shopping malls.
Research continues to demonstrate clean
parks and well maintained athletic fields

We would like to thank Town Meeting, the
many Town boards, committees, departments

Recreation
During the past year, The Recreation
Department offered 273 different programs
with atotal of 16,302 participants. Summer
use of the beaches at Saxonville, Learneds and
Waushakum increased 2% from the previous
summer for a total of 15,800 visitors. New
programs offered this year included Zumba,
Special Needs Swimming, Art, and Dance, Go
for your Goals for Girls, Walk with the Parks
and Adult Aikido.
This was 
the first year the department
managed the ever popular " Friday Night
Concerts on the Green." An eight week
schedule of local talent included the sounds of
the ` Infractions,' `Common Ground,' `The
Three Swinging Tenors,' `XRB,' `Off the
Hook' & `  Three of a  Kind.'  The weather
prevented the `Heritage Pops Orchestra' and
the ` Reminisants' from performing. The
season was a  success with some concerns
Reereation & Cultural Affairs 
2011 Annual Report
expressed about the stage placement due to
the glare from the setting sun. These concerns
will be addressed for the 2012 season.
Assisted by the Friends of Framingham
Recreation, the department sponsored the
following special events this year: Pumpkins
in the Park, Green Up Day and the Egg -citing
Egg Hunt. These events continue to grow in
popularity and size. Additionally, with thanks
to Framingham Co- operative Bank for the
funding, walkers at Cushing Park were
surprised to be offered hotdogs and hot
chocolate as they visited the Park on several
occasions over the course of the year.
In conjunction with the Framingham Police
Department, Framingham Fire Department
and Selectmen, the Parks &  Recreation
Department hosted a  special remembrance
ceremony and vigil on September 11, 2011 for
the 10th anniversary of the attack of the
United States. In addition to honoring the 17
individuals that had ties to Framingham, the
event included the placement of nearly 3,000
American Flags to represent each person who
lost their life on that tragic day. The
ceremony was held at the `September 11th
Living Memorial' located in Cushing
Memorial Park.
Our Department has joined other members
from the community on the Framingham
Youth Development Collaborative, an
initiative implemented by District Attorney
Gerard Leone. Thisgroup meets every other
month and is working toward developing
programs and job opportunities for the youth
of Framingham.
The Department experienced some transition
this year with the retirement of PAL
Basketball League Coach Tom Click as well as
several longtime instructors and coaches who
were replaced in our Summer Swim Team,
Crafts, Keyboard and Playgroup classes. The
PAL basketball league is now led by the new
Director Alan Williams and once again
challenged the New England Patriots Jerod

We are thankful for the many successful
grants that enhanced our 2011 programs. The
Department of Public Health and the State of
Massachusetts provided funding for
continued Youth at Risk programming.
Future Skills funded two summer counselors
for our Recreation Centers while Project
Bread and the United States Department of
Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service
provided free breakfast and lunch for the
Recreation Special Needs Program. We
would also like to thank the Sudbury River
Tennis Club for their generous donation
which was used to help defray the cost of the
summer tennis lessons. Additionally, Friends
of Framingham Recreation was able to grant
numerous scholarships for Recreation
Programs to families in need.
We would like to thank the Town Selectmen,
Town Meeting Members, Town Staff and
numerous community volunteers for their
support and dedication. Without their
continued support, we 
would not be
successful in offering quality programs to the
residents of Framingham.
We welcome input from Town residents and
we value both your feedback and involvement
in our programs.

Parks Maintenance
The Parks Maintenance Division continues to
provide some of the best maintained facilities
in the Metro West area. We have implemented
a quality maintenance program to maintain
the condition of our high use turf areas with a
balanced turf management plan of aeration,
Reereation & Cultural Affairs 
2011 Annual Report
top dressing, fertilization, seeding, mowing
and proper irrigation.
With the increased demand for additional
practice and game fields, over use of facilities
and the decline in turf quality is a major
problem that we face. There continues to be
an increase in participation in some of the
seasonal sports. Long range planning for
alternative field space still needs to be a
priority, yet this will be a challenge due to the
funding increases required. The second phase
of field renovations at Fuller Field was
completed in 2011.
Our Maintenance Department continues to
support the athletic programs of three high
schools, Framingham High, Marian High and
Joseph P. Keefe Technical High School.
Others that rely on our department for a
portion of their athletic program needs are
Framingham State University and Mass Bay
CommunityCollege. In addition to school
athletics, the Department provides scheduling
and facilities for hundreds of other user
groups from the Framingham community. In
addition, our staff took responsibility for the
Concerts on the Common series this past summer
with great success.
Our working relationship with Keefe
Technical School enabled our department to
complete some major projects. In the Fall,
Keefe's electrical lab provided labor to finish
the second phase of the Butterworth Tennis
Light Project. This was a CDBG project that
had been divided into two projects; one for
infrastructure and a second phase to relight
the tennis courts. This mutually beneficial
relationship with Keefe Tech provides the
Town of Framingham with access to cost
effective and professionally supervised
electrical, carpentry, plumbing and metal
fabrication, while affording students the
benefit of practical " real world" learning
experiences in a commercial setting.
Infield renovations to Longs and Bowditch
baseball fields were completed in the Fall. The
134
Page 147
Town of Framingham
renovations enabled us to improve /repair the
poor drainage and uneven play areas from
these two highly used sites. We are also
renovating many of our playground area fall
zones and replacing old wood chips with
safety zone wood fiber mulch. We have begun
installing signage to some of our parks and
will continue to make our areas identifiable.
Through our Capital Budget program, we
were able to purchase a new vehicle for our
fleet; purchase beach docks for Learneds
Beach and make some handicap accessible
improvements at the Furber Park playground.
After a delay due to a contractor's problem,
we were able to bring another handicap
accessible playground on line at Farm Pond.
The department also collaborated with
Sudbury Valley and the Framingham
Agricultural Committee to start a community
garden program at the Pratt Street property.
The area was used by local residents allowing
an opportunity for them to cultivate their own
produce.
This year's Arbor Day of Service project in
Framingham was collaboration with our staff,
Keefe Tech and the Public Works
Department and was in memory of Jason
Pierangeli, a Keefe Tech teacher who passed
away earlier intheyear. Thegroups worked
together to enhance the grounds of the school
and a tree was planted in Jason's memory as
well.
Our active tree maintenance program
continues by concentrating on the removal of
hazardous trees and the pruning of trees for
safety and structural reasons.
The hurricane and early snow of October
brought a lot of damage to trees in many
areas. Our department spent 811 man hours
to clean up the storm damage to parks and
school areas within our purview. The town
wide beautification program continues to be a
successful collaboration with our department,
volunteer groups and court system labor. We
Reereation & Cultural Affairs 
2011 Annual Report
continue to benefit from the donation of
labor and services provided by private
companies to improve high visibility roadside
areas and offer them the opportunity to
promote their donations at the same time.
I would like to thank all the volunteers and
volunteer groups that worked with us on
many projects over the year. Their support is
and always will be a tremendous resource. We
continue to give support and resources to
other Town Departments including the
School Department, Building Services, Public
Works andConservation. Wewould alsolike
to thank all of the Town departments for the
cooperation they have provided throughout
the year; it would be very difficult for us to
achieve these successes without their help.

During the spring of 2011, a new valve was
installed on the 49 year old ammonia system.
This new valve was essential to isolate
ammonia inthe event ofaleak. During the
installation, the bulls -eye column on the main
receiver was also replaced as it monitors the
liquid level of ammonia.
In the summer of 2011, the arena added a
new exterior LED sign. The signwas custom
made to fit the existing frame and the cost
was significantly lower than if the sign had
been replaced. Thenewsignprovides

programs, activities and services for older
adults and the people who care for them. The
Council on Aging Board assesses the needs of
elders and advises them on programs and
services to meet theirneeds. TheCenteris
staffed by four full time municipal employees
and 14 part time employees who are funded
by grants from the state and private
foundations. The center also benefits from
the thousands of hours donated by hundreds
of volunteers. These volunteers perform a
variety of functions: providing tours of the
center, answering the phones, assembling the
newsletter for mailing, working in the
Heritage Gallery consignment shop and
helping with numerous activities at the center.
The Friends of Callahan is a  non -profit,
501(C) 3 program that raises funds to assist
the center in offering its many programs and
activities.
Accomplishments:
Attendance in activities and programs at the
Callahan Center increased from 30,625 in
2010 to 31,548 in 2011. Many people come in
on a daily basis. The significant increase in the
number of seniors participating in the many
exercise classes we offer indicates they are
taking an active role in maintaining and
improving their health and well- being. Interest
in the Callahan Center Travel program has
grown with 130 new clients in 2011 and a
total of 40 trips were enjoyed by more than
1,000 seniors.
The SHINE program provided more than
1,200 sessions of assistance regarding health
insurance information for seniors. Loans of
durable medical equipment were made free of
charge to almost 300 seniors.
In September, the Callahan Center became
the ninth senior center in Massachusetts to be
awarded accreditation by the National
Councils on Aging /National Institute for
Senior Centers. Only 199 other senior centers
across the country have achieved this
recognition of meeting nine standards of
excellence established by the national groups.
Reereation & Cultural Affairs 
2011 Annual Report
Once again in December, seniors at the
Callahan Center partnered with students and
teachers from the Miriam McCarthy School in
raising funds to donate to the Kate
McSweeney Homeless Fund.
Seventy seniors who are 90 years of age and
older were feted at the annual Jewels of
Framingham event in May with students from
Keefe Technical School offering their talents
to accentuate the beauty of this fabulous
group of seniors.
New and improved services and
programs:
In the Spring, the Friends of Callahan began
offering a luncheon for seniors once a month,
catered by Mark Curtis of American Eagles
Grille. It was so successful that by the end of
the year they agreed to offer the luncheon
twice per month. The fee is $4 per person it is
a great deal. For those who prefer solitary
activities, WiFi access was made available in
the Friends' cafe that also offers a new puzzle
table that was donated.
The number of support groups offered at the
Center has grown from nine to eleven with
the addition of Living with Cancer and Men's
Prostate groups. More than 150 seniors benefit
from all these monthly support groups.
The Callahan Center now offers assistance
with the new applications for the fuel
assistance program to those seniors who
qualify. In addition, we worked with 39
eligible seniors to receive a credit of up to
725 on their property tax bills. In return,
they volunteered approximately 89 hours of
assistance to town departments in a variety of
ways in the "Senior Tax Work Off Program."
The Bi- Lingual Outreach Aide collaborated
with the Latino Health Insurance Program to
provide additional assistance to the Latino
community. We continue to encourage Latino
elders to participate in activities at the
Callahan. ESOL classes for the Asian
137

community of elders are also held twice a
week.
A group of 75 volunteers were recruited from
local businesses, religious groups, parents,
teachers and students of several area schools
to provide 225 hours of yard work /cleanup
for 14 senior households.
New events and happenings in 2011!
An effort was made to appeal to younger
seniors from the Baby Boomer generation by
offering "Evenings at Callahan" once a month
where the center remained open until 9 p.m.
with a  series of programs geared to their
interests. Due to a lack of interest from this
age group, the evening program was canceled
after a few months. We will continue to seek 
2011 Annual Report
other opportunities to connect with younger
seniors in the future.
On December 16, 2011, after a lengthy
search, Grace O'Donnell of West Roxbury
was offered the position of Director of Elder
Services. Grace will replace Mary Parcher who
served as the Director for many years. The
community wishes much happiness to Mary in
her retirement and thanks her for all her years
of service. Grace O'Donnell will begin as the
new director in January 2012.

with the Chief Financial Officer, the Finance
Committee, Ways and Means Committee and
StandingCommittee onEducation. InApril
2011, the School Committee voted a FY12
level -service budget of $ 92,151.281,
Superintendent Steve Hiersche presented a
series of budget reductions, which though not
recommended, would enable the School
Committee to close the budget gap to the
CFO's initial budget recommendation of
90,218. 637, In early May, the CFO provided
a  new FY12 budget recommendation of
91,164. 177, In mid -May, the School
Administration identified a budget projection
error which reduced the gap to the CFO's
budget recommendation. The School
Committee voted unanimously an FY12
Budget request to Town Meeting of
91,343, 620, resulting in a $443,179 budget
deficittotheCFO's recommendation. Inlate
May, the School Committee successfully
negotiated a  one -year contract with the
Framingham Teachers Association. The FTA
accepted a  zero percent cost -of- living
adjustment and agreed to defer movement on
Edueation & Libraries 
kindergarten aides; second school secretaries
and two fulltime library assistants. Ata
Special Fall Town Meeting, the CFO's
recommendation to transfer $207K to the
School Committee's FY12 budget passed.
Since one -fifth of the school year had already
passed, these funds would cover the
rebuilding priorities.
Bus Privatization
In April 2011, the School Committee
considered the privatization of its bus fleet
and drivers as a means to reduce costs to the
Town. While considering the value of a
successful, effective and efficient school bus
transportation system and the loyalty of
Framingham's bus drivers to the Town of
Framingham over the past 70 years, the
School Committee had to consider significant
savings to the Town, primarily in employee
health care costs, which could be realized if
the School Committee decided to privatize.
On April 25, 2011, the School Committee
voted to accept the low bid for buses and
drivers by Durham School Services for the
five -year period beginning in the summer
2011 through the summer of 2016.

Policy
In 2010, the School Committee began a
cover -to -cover review of the Framingham
Public Schools Policy Manual in conjunction
with the Massachusetts Association of School
Committee and district principals,
administrators and staff. The district's manual
contains approximately 200 policies, some
originally written prior to 1970. Thereview
continued throughout 2011. TheSchool
Committee hopes to complete this work in
the spring 2012 and post the FPS Policy
Manual online by the end of the 2011/2012
school year.
Curriculum & Instruction
The Committee requested the administration's
review of its many major programs
throughout the year. Specifically, directors
and principals presented analysis and
recommendations for the following: Special
Education, Bilingual, Gifted and Talented,
middle school math, potential changes to
middle school STEM initiatives, the Blocks
Preschool, district scores on national and state
tests, including APs, SATs and MCAS,
evaluation of implementation of the
International Baccalaureate program in
Wilson, and the potential of establishment of
the Barbieri Two -Way school as a Horace
Mann Charter, as encouraged by the
Department of Elementary and Secondary
Education.
In addition, the committee partnered with the
administration and the Framingham Teachers'
Association in addressing the federal Race to
the Top initiative regarding modifications to
Teacher Evaluations in order to qualify for
700,000 in funding for Framingham over the
next three years.
Facilities
Upon the approval of Town Meeting of the
School Department's capital budget requests,
140
Page 153
Town of Framingham
the district was able to implement much of
the next phase of its 10 year facilities plan.
The B &G work necessary to relocate the
Blocks Preschool program from the King
building to Juniper Hill was completed over
the summer of 2011, for program movement
over the summer of 2012. Administration
from three current temporary locations will
subsequently be moved to King.
The Committee also closely monitored the
hearings at General Chemical and their impact
on the Woodrow Wilson Elementary School.
School Choice
The Committee reviewed the analysis of
School Choice vs. Neighborhood Schools
completed by the Superintendent, Dr.
Hiersche. In sum, he found that the buildings
are primarily located in the north of the town,
while the majority of students in the district
resideinthesouth. Over600ofthedistrict' s
8,200 students would need busing regardless
ofany student assignment plan. Inaddition,
savings due to placement of particular
programs in only 1-2 schools would be lost if
those program were needed to be replicated in
each school due to a neighborhood model.
The Committee
In April 2011, incumbents Michael Bower,
David Miles and Carol Phalen were elected to
three -year terms. After the election, the
School Committee met to reorganize and elect
officers. TheSchoolCommitteeelected
Beverly Hugo as Chair, David Miles as Vice
ChairandRichard Finlay as Clerk. Inlate
December, Richard Finlay resigned his seat to
accept a new professional opportunity. The
School Committee thanked Mr. Finlay for his
dedicated service.
In closing, the School Committee would like
to thank all Framingham Public School staff
for their dedication to all of Framingham's
students, all Town staff and elected officials,
and all Framingham residents for their
continued and unwavering support for
Framingham Public School students.

SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS
REPORT
In reflecting on the past year, several themes
stand out fortheschooldistrict. Firstand
always foremost was the continued academic
achievement ofourstudents. Learning isthe
central purpose of our schools and
Framingham students learned well in 2011.
More students mean a  need for more
classrooms. The second theme was the
ongoing effort to develop a budget that allows
the schools to meet the educational needs of
students and to do so with minimal support
from the state and within the framework of
local taxes. In 2011, this task involved
significant efforts to contain costs and seek
more assistance from the State and fall Town
Meeting.
The College Board' s Advance Placement
Program (AP) offers students the opportunity
to take challenging, college -level courses while
still in high school and to receive college
credit, advanced placement, or both for
successful performance on the AP Exams.
Since 2002, the number of students taking the
AP exams has more than doubled with three
hundred and fifty six participating in 705
Advanced Placement Exams, in eighteen
subjects, in 2011. 90% of the exams were
passed and eligible for college credit. This
compares with three hundred forty who took
the exam in eighteen subjects in 2010.
Through continuing aggressive efforts of the
FHS Guidance Department, 96% of the
junior class and 91% of the sophomore class
took the Preliminary Scholastic Assessment
Test (PSAT).These numbers are impressive
compared to the fact that 65% of the junior
141
Page 154
Town of Framingham
class and 46% of the sophomore class took
the test in 2004. Over 76% of the graduating
class participated in the SAT. Framingham
students averaged 513 on the Critical Reading
portion, 527 in the Mathematics portion, and
509 on the Writing Component. These scores
compare well with National Averages which
are 497, 514 and 489 respectively.
The community should be proud that so
many students take and pass a wide variety of
these college -level exams, and that they do so
well. One result of the high student
achievement is acceptance at a  college or
university to continue education. In keeping
with past years, more than 83% of the
graduates in the Class of 2011 continued their
education at an impressive variety of
institutions of higher learning, including some
of the most selective colleges in the country.
Each year, the Boston Globe Scholastic Arts
Awards, established in 1923, is an aggressive
competition in which thousands of students
participate and only the best are awarded with
recognition. Twenty -eight Framingham
Public School students took home awards in
this arts competition. This past year, La
Cantina Restaurant established a Scholarship
program aimed at helping students, whose
family does not meet the poverty threshold,
but are experiencing hardships due to the
economy. This program helps provide the
funds for school lunch for those needy and
deserving families. Precision Marketing of
Framingham contributed to Woodrow Wilson
Elementary School in donating a Reading
Lounge, inspired by the book Igniting a Passion
for Reading by Steven Layne, and was designed
to give Wilson students a  place to enjoy
reading, complete with twenty -six beanbag
chairs, floor lamps, and children's artwork
about favorite books and reasons to read.
Stapleton Elementary School was recognized
in the Fall 2011 edition of MassResycle News for
itsrecycling efforts. FullerMiddle School was
the proud recipient of a donation from the
BOSE Corporation of  Framingham
Edueation & Libraries 
2011 Annual Report
enhancing its technology. Over one -hundred
Framingham High School students
participated in both the New England Math
League Competition and the Math Olympiad.
FHS placed fourteenth out of one hundred
and seventy -five schools that participated.
Genzyme Corporation continues to be a
proud sponsor of the Reading Pals program at
Brophy Elementary School promoting reading
fluency and comprehension skills. The
Buildings and Grounds Department was able
to take advantage of a program from MA
Energy Insight which allowed the district to
acquire, free of charge, LED light bulbs
valued at a cost of $10,000.
Woodrow Wilson Elementary School staff
and leadership have been investigating both
the International Baccalaureate Primary Years
Programme and the School of Innovation
Grant as a  solution to increasing student
achievement at Wilson. Staff, parents, and
community members have been involved in
the preparation. Therehavealreadybeen
changes in instruction in the classroom that
the school is extremely excited about. We are
looking forward to continuing that process.
In December, the Department ofElementary
and Secondary Education Commissioner
Mitchell Chester visited Barbieri Elementary
School along with the Director of English
Language Learner Education for DESE to
learn more about the Two -Way Program.
Commissioner Chester spent the morning at
Barbieri meeting with teachers, parents,
school administrators and was impressed with
the program.
Town Meeting appropriated funds to achieve
a balanced budget forFY12. TheSchool
Department is appreciative of the Town's
financial support to provide its children with
the qualityeducationthey deserve. Through
the capital investment of $ 500,000 last
summer, approved by Town Meeting, the
district was greatly able to enhance its
technology. Recognizing the value of
providing a  21" century education, this
142
Page 155
Town of Framingham
investment is critical to improving quality
education.
The success of the Framingham Public Schools
in helping students achieve, in keeping pace with
growing enrollments and in containing costs is
the result of a highly professional staff and the
tremendous support the schools have received
fromthecommunity. Onbehalfofthestudents
and staff of the Framingham Schools, thank you
for your support.

Steven A. Hiersche, Ed.D.
ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT
CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION
During the 2011 year, the district has been
fortunate in being able to put more resources,
including time, personnel and materials, into
curriculum andinstruction. Thiscoincides
with the adoption of the new Massachusetts
frameworks in English Language Arts and
math based on the Common Core, a set of
academic standards adopted in forty -one (41)
states, requirements and funding from Race
to the Top Grant to the State and districts of
Massachusetts.
Alignment work in Framingham in English
Language Arts ( ELA) and math has been
supported by new part time ELA and Math
Curriculum Alignment Coordinators; two
positions funded by grant revenues. These
coordinators have formed teams of teachers,
specialists, department heads and coaches.
These groups are working to ensure that the
curriculum taught in Framingham is the
curriculum being assessed by the new MCAS
assessments that are being phased in over the
next two years. The Curriculum Alignment
Coordinators have also been working with
teachers on data analysis so that data may be
used to improve instruction. BesidesMCAS
data, teachers in grades 3 through 9 utilize the
norm reference assessment, Measures of
Academic Progress (MAP) data in reading and
math, as well as other assessments outlined in
a new assessment calendar also developed this
Edueation & Libraries 
2011 Annual Report
year. Alongwith curriculum alignment efforts
in math and ELA, we have been able to
engage a team of teachers and administrators
in Science and in Social Studies in reviewing
our existing curriculum in each of these
content areas, enriching it, ensuring it meets
the state's frameworks, is consistent across the
district and is linked between grade levels.
Materials for middle school language arts,
math, science and social studies, have been
purchased and are being used daily. The
materials include on -line resources that are
needed for a new literacy and math lab at the
middle level which provides remediation,
extension and enrichment to students based
on theiridentified needs. At the elementary
level, new materials for struggling readers
have been purchased and are being piloted
which should be especially useful for students
with limited Englishproficiency. Substantial
dollars were also spent on leveled readers,
chapter books, word study books, and other
materials to upgrade existing resources in
elementary classrooms, bookrooms and
libraries. With the re- establishment of a
district curriculum team, there has been more
opportunity for collaboration among directors
of bilingual education, special education, and
giftedandtalentededucation. Theteamhas
been working on more explicit planning
around professional development for the
Framingham teaching staff. Using research on
effective professional development, we will
develop a  vision for all professional
development to help ensure our limited
resources are utilized most effectively. The
curriculum team has begun to prepare for new
English Language Learners standards based
on World Class Instruction and Assessment
WIDA),adopted by 22 states including
Massachusetts. Districtpersonnelhavebeen
learning about new assessments for limited
English proficient students which will begin
during the 2012 -2013 school year, also part of
the WIDA adoption.

curriculum. Individual teachers andschools
have pursued a wide variety of programs and
opportunities for students in these areas,
making it the right time to work on
coordination and standardization. Our first
efforts will be at the middle and high school
level.
The past year has been a time for rebuilding
and reawakening with respect to curriculum
and instruction. A lot has been started, but
much remains to be done to ensure that the
structures, processes, personnel, policies and
necessary resources are in place to support
high quality education for each student in
Framingham.

SPECIAL EDUCATION PROGRAM
The Department of Special Education
provides a broad array of services for children
and youth identified with disabilities from the
ages 
of three through twenty -two. The
referral, evaluation and placement procedures
are governed by state and federal special
education laws and regulations, namely, The
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
IDEA). FPS is committed to the goal of
providing an appropriate education for
students with special needs in the least
restrictive setting.
The following programs and services were
offered by FPS from Pre -School to High
School: Special Education Resource Rooms
are available ineachschool. The Resource
Room or Learning Center model provides
direct teaching in both special and general
education classroom settings, through
inclusion, supportive teaching and /or
consultation to  the general education
classroom teacher of identified students.
There are fifty -two Substantially Separate
classes from Pre -School through High School.
These students require comprehensive
programming which is provided outside of
the regular education classroom for more than
60% of the school day. These classes are
located at the High School, three Middle
Schools, at seven Elementary Schools, and at
the Pre -School serving the special education
needs of students throughout the District.
Where appropriate, these students are
included in general education classes and
ancillary activities. 
145
Page 158
Town of Framingham
Related services, namely speech /language
therapy, occupational therapy, physical
therapy, adaptive physical education and
services from the teachers of the visually
impaired, orientation & mobility specialist and
consulting audiologist may be included in a
student's Individualized Education Plan (IEP)
and are provided by specialized personnel at
allschools. Inclusion programs have been
established using a  variety of approaches
throughout the district. Some classes are co-
taught, some classes meet for specific periods,
and some special education teachers are
assigned to a group of classes. In addition,
some teachers who are dually licensed in
special education and regular education have
full time responsibility for inclusion classes at
the elementary level.
Framingham is a 
model for Pre - School
Programs for both children with special needs
and typical children ages three to five. The
placement of children with special needs in
the Pre -School Programs emphasizes
language, communication and social skills
development, and integration with children
without special needs.
Framingham continues to see an increase in
the number of children with autism, multiple
disabilities /medical needs and developmental
delays at the Pre -School level. At the High
School level there is a significant increase in
the number of students identified with
social/ emotional disabilities. The severity of
these disabilities presents challenges to the
school district to develop new and additional
programs in order to support these children in
the public schools.
In conclusion, Framingham has continued to
implement and provide a  comprehensive
continuum of programs, services, and
placement options for students with
disabilities. Framingham is fortunate to have
an active Special Education Parent Advisory
Council whose role is to advise the special
education department and to engage parents

of children with disabilities in the schools

BILINGUAL EDUCATION
PROGRAMS
The Department of Bilingual Education
provides support and services to students in
grades K -12 whose primary language is other
than English. This student group is often
referred to as English language learners (ELL)
and the primary goal of all bilingual
programming is  to provide specialized
instruction in English language development
to enable ELLS to access the curriculum and
achieve in an English dominant environment.
Bilingual education is an umbrella term which
encompasses a variety of different types of
program models. In Framingham, such
models range from Sheltered English
Immersion to Two -Way, to Transitional
Bilingual Education, and include variations on
each of these programs. In 2011, 14.0% of
the district K -12 enrollment was identified as
limited English proficient or ELL and FPS
offered specific programming and support at
eight different schools: five elementary
schools, Barbieri, Brophy, Dunning, Potter
Road, and Wilson; 2 middle schools, Walsh
and Fuller; and at FHS.
Due to the dedication of the staff and success
of programming, FPS continues to be
recognized as  an educational leader in
bilingual education. Our staff, from faculty to
administration, is solicited for input across the
state and plays an active role in Department
of Elementary and Secondary Education
sponsored initiatives for ELLS, the Urban
ELL Director's Network, DESE Curriculum
Summit, Massachusetts Reading Association -
MRA ELL Ad -Hoc Committee, and various
other policy groups. The Bilingual
Department also continues to lend its
particular expertise to several committees in
the district reviewing curriculum, assessment,
intervention, literacy, and data relating to the
146
Page 159
Town of Framingham
education of all students in Framingham.
This is an accurate and honorable recognition
of the high quality of teachers, programs, and
services provided at all of our schools.
This year the Bilingual Education Department
has sponsored several professional
development opportunities to  enhance
teachers' understanding and ability to address
the complex needs of ELLS. These
professional development offerings have been
on -going throughout the year, including
summer months, and have enjoyed the
participation of faculty across grade levels and
from every department. Theyhaveranged
from professional learning communities, to
locally sponsored seminars, to participation in
workshops lead by national leaders in
instruction forELLS. Staffandalllevels of
administration have worked collaboratively to
expand ESL services for students and to bring
expanded support to teachers of ELL
students across the district.
Another area of continued growth for our
department has been the town -wide Bilingual
Parent Advisory Council. The purpose ofthe
group is to provide parents of ELL students
an opportunity to meet and discuss the unique
needs of their children. Over the summer
the Bilingual Department in collaboration
with FSU and the Framingham Adult ESL
program sponsored ESL for the parents of
our students. Over 100 parents participated
in four different sections of beginner and
intermediate ESL classes. Two sections
comprised of our parents continued in the
Fall and the Winter terms respectively of the
Adult ESL program. This year, the co-
presidents are actively involved in soliciting
parent participation at the building level and
have hosted meetings at different schools
each month. Also, bilingual parents through
the B -PAC participated in the search for the
new Superintendent. The success of the
town -wide B -PAC and the tireless efforts of
the co- presidents reflect the extraordinary
commitment of the Framingham community's
parents to the education of their children.

ADULT ESL PLUS
Framingham Adult ESL Plus enrolled 670
students in each of two semesters for 2011.
Students came from 32 countries and spoke
19 different languages. They ranged in age
from 18 to 85. Students attended a.m. or p.m.
English as Second Language classes, Adult
Basic Education classes, GED preparation
classes, or Citizenship Preparation classes. All
were eager to improve their English skills and
in doing so become more fully integrated into
the Framingham community.
Forty -six students graduated from the
program's highest levels and five students
received their GED after successfully passing
theGEDexamination. Attendance forthe
year was excellent with over 85% of enrolled
students completing each semester.
Highlights of 2011 include:
A highly successful fundraising event
sponsored by the Metrowest ESL Fund and
hosted by Susan Wornick which honored two
of the rescued Chilean miners.
A week -long Monitoring Visit by The
Massachusetts Department of Elementary and

approved assessment. 40% of students at
Framingham Adult ESL Plus made
measurable gains.
Setting and Meeting Goals -  Programs set
on average at least 2 goals per student per year
and programs meet on average at least one
goalperyear. Students atFraminghamAdult
ESL Plus set on average 3.5 goals per year and
met 1.6 goals per year.
Another indication of program effectiveness
is increased student involvement in the area's
economy, schools, and community. Students
report obtaining citizenship, joining school
organizations, becoming more active in
community groups, getting better jobs,
attending training programs, and starting
businesses.
Framingham Adult ESL Plus also has an
active volunteer component through which
some of the hundreds of wait -listed students
can receive 2 hours a week of tutoring. At
present 8 of the over 30 volunteers are former
students intheprogram. Theyhavedecided
to "give back" to the program that helped
them so much.

GIFTED AND TALENTED
PROGRAMMING (SAGE)
The Framingham Public Schools convened a
Gifted & Talented Task Force during the
2010 -2011 year to review Sage program
elements. This Task Force was comprised of
Sage staff, administrators, teachers, and
parents. Its goal was to review current and
past practices, consider programming options
that can best meet the needs of students and
staff, and recommend program elements
given current or additional staffing.
The Task Force presented their results to the
School Committee on March 15, 2011. Sage
staff and administration used these findings
and the reinstatement of a Sage staff position
to guide the following program changes that
have taken place during the 2011 -2012 school
year.
Elementary
The department has transitioned into a
hybrid model to facilitate the exchange of
ideas between the regular classroom teacher
and the Sage teacher.
Pull out services are provided for
identified students in Grades 3 -5  for
approximately two hours per week.
Scheduling by school dictates whether
students have two one -hour blocks or one
two -hour block.
Push -in services provides resources to
classroom teachers in Grades K -5.

Page 161
Town of Framingham
Screening of current first grade referrals
is  underway with services to begin in
September 2012.
Word Masters (  Gr. 3 -5) and Math
League (Gr. 4 & 5) is offered as an option to
all students in those grades.
Programming exists in all buildings and
placement of Sage itinerant staff is made
according to numbers of identified students
and the size of the building.
Middle School
In an effort to better serve Sage students at
the middle school level, a  move to a
collaboration model is being made with a
focus on differentiated instruction coaching.
The Collaborative Model:
o  Maximizes professional development
and teacher collaboration via online classes,
study groups, newsletters, teaming within the
classroom setting, and presentations at staff
and curriculum meetings.
o  Topics include cognitive complexity,
compacting curriculum, tiered instruction,
creativity and flexible grouping practices.
Staffing is comprised of three teachers
working as a team (FTE 1.1) Student.
Student Programming:
o  Identified Sage students do not have a
regularly scheduled pull out class.
o  Instead, students have opportunities
to engage in options sponsored by the
department including Word Masters, Focus
Discussion Groups, and Independent
Investigation during and after school.
Students and families receive notices and
mailings throughout the year of available
activities.
o  Student support lunchtime discussion
focus groups offerings include organization
skills, self -regulation skills, stress management
and goal setting.
Teacher Programming:
o  Provides imbedded professional
development (coaching)
o  A three -credit hybrid course (primarily
online with some in- person meetings) through
Framingham State entitled "Teaching Tools
Edueation & Libraries 
2011 Annual Report
for the 21" Century" is available to middle
school teachers.
o  A "Differentiation Toolkit" has been
provided for each classroom placing practical
strategies and solutions.
o  Teacher trainings were held during the
course of the year. A half -day release for
interested staff during the school day enabled
specific concentration on ways to maximize
use of the toolkit during teacher workshops.
o  Each team received a  set of three
resource books including: Differentiation:
Simplified, Realistic and Effective•, Blooms and
Beyond, and; Teaching Gifted Kids in the Regular
Classroom: Strategies and Techniques Every Teacher
Can Use to Meet the Academic Needs of the Gifted
and Talented.
o  Alternative/ differentiated lessons are
made available in support of the Thinkquiry
resource and the Literacy Lab initiative.
Town -wide Initiatives
Services have been centralized to better
operate in conjunction

TITLE I
Title I  is a federally funded program that
provides financial resources to districts and
schools with a higher percentage of students
from low- income families. All four of our
Title I schools, Barbieri, Brophy, McCarthy
and Woodrow Wilson Elementary Schools,
have " school -wide programs." This means
that all students in the school are eligible to
receive support through the Title I program.
149
Page 162
Town of Framingham
In the Title I schools, we continue to provide
interventionists who support the district goal
of ensuring that all students make at least one
year's growth in literacy and mathematics.
This year, intervention groups as well as
student learning goals were determined using
student data at school -based, grade -level
intervention meetings. These grade -level
intervention meetings, which included
interventionists, classroom teachers, and other
support personnel, were held in the fall,
reviewed in the winter, and will be revisited
one more time in the spring at each school.
In addition to the interventionists, Title I also
continues to provide math coaches. The math
coaches work closely with classroom teachers
to support the mathematics achievement of
those students most at risk of not meeting the
state's high academic standards. Finally, Title I
is also continuing to support data teams
during the 2011 -2012 school year. Through
this initiative, teachers work in collaborative
groups to review student data and use it to
guide instructional decisions. Combined with
Title IIA funds, data teams are well-
established in all schools.
The Title I  program is pleased with the
support it is able to provide to students,
families, and the general school community.

SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICES
School Health Services (  SHS) provide
comprehensive nursing care to the students of
Framingham Public Schools. Nurse staffing
includes one full time nurse in each
elementary and middle school, a part time
nurse at Thayer Campus, two nurses at the
high school, and two adolescent health nurses.
This year SHS again benefits from the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health
Essential School Health Services (  ESHS)
program. ESHS monies continue to

Since it opened in January 2010, 140 students
have enrolled and are accessing clinic services
during the school day.
During Fall 2011, Judy Styer, Director of
School Health Services assisted with the
development of the district's new concussion
policy and protocol. The policy developed in
collaboration with the high school school
nurses, Athletic Director, Gary Doherty, Dr.
Karen Sadler, school physician, and the
district's athletic trainer, Patricia Pauris, is
closely aligned with Massachusetts regulations,
was approved by School Committee in
February 2012 and is being implemented
presently. Director Styer also contributed to
the development of a  new district policy
related to service animals in schools and other
health - related School
review and revisions. 
Committee policy
SHS continues its long history of partnerships
with institutions engaged in health care and
research. Collaborations are ongoing with
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center /Boston University and the SONIC

moles and melanoma in school -aged children),
the New England Eye Institute in the
operation of the Vision Center at Fuller
Middle School (  providing comprehensive
vision care to all members of the FPS
community),and Boston University Goldman
School of Dental Medicine' s dental sealant
program.
The district's Teen Pregnancy and Parenting
program is in its second year of a successful
three year partnership with the United Way of
Tri County. The program, "Strengthening
Youth in a United Way' is staffed by two
adolescent health nurses who provide support
150

and prevention services to pregnant teens,
new teen mothers and fathers and other high
risk students in the district. New to the
program's work this year is  the
implementation of the "  Teen Outreach
Program" a national service learning program
which is effective at increasing academic
success and preventing teen pregnancy in high
risk youth. This curriculum will be utilized in
after -school programming at the high school.
SHS continues its commitment to providing
Preeminent nursing services to the FPS
community. We look forward to another year
of administering our program.

TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT
The Transportation Department provides a
vital service for the Framingham Public
Schools. Over five thousand public school
students utilize bus transportation on a daily
basis. Thetransportation office continues to
work diligently to ensure our students with
safe and efficient transport. Massachusetts
General Law requires the School
Departments to provide transportation to all
children outside two miles of each respective
district school in grades K - 6. To that end,
Framingham provides school transportation
to three hundred students in non -public
schools in Framingham. Duetobudget
constraints, the School Department moved to
a fee -based transportation program eight years
151

ago for those students in grades 7 -  12. Fees
are waived for special circumstances such as
children placed in Framingham foster care
homes, homeless students, special education
students and students on medical waivers.
The district does have limited seats available
for purchase for students who live within 2
miles for grades K —12.
In the 2011/2012 school year, the District's
Transportation Department has successfully

advice or action.
Community Engagement
Staff and students of the construction cluster
career and technical programs of Carpentry,
Electrical, Plumbing, Horticulture and Metal
Fabrication and Welding participated in many
community projects throughout the School

The Superintendent's Evaluation Sub -
Committee considered the process by which
the Committee and the Superintendent
established goals for the administration
against which the Superintendent's
153
Page 166

performance is evaluated periodically by the
Committee. The Sub -Committee proposed
that it be reorganized to achieve broader
participation among the towns representatives
and to maintain some continuity in its work.
The on -going Sub -Committee members are
John Kahn, William Gaine, Linda Fobes, A.J.
Mulvey and Dr. Stephen Kane, Chair.
The School Committee adopted goals for the
Superintendent's performance evaluation
period from July 2011 through June 30, 2012.
The goals adopted related to: developing
District budgets that will meet the approval of
the District Towns and managing them
effectively; continuingtostabilizeandto
increase the student population; represent the
interest of the School Committee in collective
bargaining for a  new teacher evaluation
instrument in compliance with the RTTT
grant and the new educator evaluation
regulation; lead the staff toward the
improvement of student performance and
close the achievement gap in all assessed
academic and CTE content areas; lead the
staff to develop new career and technical
curriculum components in existing programs
and a  new post -secondary offering; the
Superintendent will lead the growth and
development of adult education to satisfy
training requirements for work force
development.
The Committee completed its periodic
evaluation of  the Superintendent's
accomplishments against established goals and
desired personal qualities. The complete
record of that evaluation is a public document
that is available at the Keefe office.
The Committee approved a new contract with
the Superintendent extending his employment
through June 30, 2015. The text of the
contract is a public document and may be
seen at the Keefe office.
During the course of the year the
Superintendent brought the administrative

adjustment and alignment with other
employment contracts in the District.
School Improvement Plans
The Committee adopted The School
Improvement Plan for the 2010 — 2011 school
year which embodies specific performance
objectives as follows: (1) maintaining and
providing a  safe environment for all
individuals who use school facilities for
education, athletics and community events; (2)
developing, implementing and evaluating the
effectiveness of programs in meeting their
goals; (3) expanding community partnerships
and communications with all constituents;
and, (4) using data to assess existing programs
to bring about productive initiatives to
stabilize and increase enrollment.
The Committee reviewed the progress toward
the goals of the 2010 -  2011 School
Improvement Plan. The report of Principal
Canali noted tangible specific improvements
in school safety, academic and CTE program
growth, expanded participation in community
initiatives and the continued improvements in
the use of data.
Discipline
The Committee approved revisions to the
Student Handbook that had previously been
approved by the School Council. Major
changes relate to: providing extra help for
students who exceed the maximum of 12
unexcused absences; authorizing, upon due
process, the principal to suspend a student
upon issuance of a felony complaint or to
expel a  student upon conviction; and
inclusion of state compliant provisions
regarding bullying. The policy is available on
the Keefe web site.
After detailed consideration of Keefe's
comprehensive bullying policy, it  was
unanimously approved by the Committee.
Race to the Top Program
In 2009, the Superintendent met with the
leaders of the Keefe Tech Education
154
Page 167
Town of Framingham
Association and the Chairman of the South
Middlesex Regional Vocational Technical
School District School Committee to form an
alliance and apply for participation in the Race
to the Top Grant Program that was offered in
Massachusetts. The South Middlesex
Regional Vocational Technical School District
qualified for this grant and will have access to
approximately $ 112,00000. to be used over a
fouryearperiod. Thisgrant opportunity was
designed to achieve five major objectives:
improve educator effectiveness, improve
curriculum and instruction, help to create
school turnaround in  identified low
performing schools, improve college and
career readiness, and to provide educators
with real time actionable data through
improved data systems and infrastructure.
The Superintendent expressed pride that at
Keefe Regional Technical School labor
Teachers Association),  management
Superintendent and Administration) and the
employer (School Committee) will be working
together to participate in this education
improvement initiative. These funds andthe
anticipated DESE assistance will allow our
school district to implement the stated
improvements in a 
timely and effective
manner. I anticipate that these changes will
be required of all districts within three years.
Post Graduate Program
The Keefe post -graduate program serves
current or recent ( 1 to 2 year) high school
graduates from member towns. Enrollees
have met their academic requirements for
graduation and participate only to the extent
of available positions in their chosen
vocational program.
The Budget Process
The Budget Sub - Committee, members
Stephen Kane, Yvonne Giargiari, Ruth
Knowles, Larry Cooper and Linda Fobes
under the Chair, Edward Burman presented a
preliminary FY13 budget representing a
5.78% increase ( approximately $890,000) over
the prior year's actual budget. The final
FY12 budget reflected a 2.74% increase.
Edueation & Libraries 
2011 Annual Report
The Superintendent continued his practice of
meeting informally early in the budget process
with the financial officers of the member
towns to develop mutual awareness of both
municipal budget constraints and the efforts
of the Committee to manage the school
efficiently and effectively while recognizing
those limitations. The Committee continued
to consider reductions in the preliminary
budget and the budget as submitted to the
member towns and was approved by all

Auditor's Report
The annual audit by the independent
accounting firm of McCarthy &  Hargrave
disclosed no inaccuracies in the financial
statements. The GASB 45 report was noted.
The audit report also noted that the energy
project had met its stipulated guarantee
benchmarks.
Business Office
The business office staff of the South
Middlesex Regional Vocational Technical
School District has designed and implemented
many improvements over the past two years.
Human resource management, employee
benefits programs, procurement practices,
contract proposals, grant fund accounting,
grant management, student cafeteria
management, student nutrition, budget
preparation and management, continuing
education registration and inventory control
are all components of the business office
operations that have undergone significant
changes andefficiencies. Themostsignificant
improvement to our operation has been the
conversion to a new business management
accounting software known as Budget Sense.
This major conversion from an antiquated
system positions the South Middlesex School
District to take advantage of available
technology changes as we proceed into the
21" century. In 2011 -12, our business office
staff will focus on fine tuning the Budget
Sense conversion by providing professional
development training as needed for our staff.
155
Page 168
Town of Framingham
In addition, our business manager and human
resource generalist will collaborate with the
administrative staff to complete the task of
updating all of our professional position job
descriptions. The business office staff will
also engage with the Superintendent to
analyze and prepare for changes in health
insurance offerings due to recent legislative
actions.
State Aid
The Governor and Legislature again proposed
reductions in state aid to transportation
50 %).  These funds provide access to
regional schools where transportation
networks extend across community lines.
Moreover, cuts made after member
communities have approved balanced regional
school budgets based upon reliable forecasts
may require significant reductions in
educational programs. The Superintendent
and the Committee Chair, with the support of
the Committee, addressed their concerns to
the Governor and State legislators and to the
Massachusetts Association of  School
Committees.
Siemens' Energy Conservation Project
Siemens Industry provided the South
Middlesex Regional Vocational Technical
School District with an energy savings
guarantee report. This report details the
guarantee period savings by comparing the
guaranteed energy savings versus the actual
energy savings. Thetotalverifiedenergy
savings for year three of the performance
contract is $557,284. The total guaranteed
savings were projected to be $540,419. The
difference between the total guaranteed
savings versus the actual savings results in an
additional savings of $16,866.
Personnel Administration

issue of maintaining an appropriate health
insurance program in the face of rising costs.

Enrollment, 
Retention 
Recruiting and Student
The Keefe Regional Technical School is a
school of application. Maintainingahealthy
enrollment of students for our day school
operation is essential for our financial support
and overall operational success. Our
enrollment has improved in the last two years
and we are expecting further improvements
thisyear. The superintendent has indicated
that he believes that the quality and rigor of
our school programs and the safety and
culture of our school environment will dictate
our success in attracting students and their
families to Keefe Technical School. The
Superintendent has emphasized that the
administration, faculty and support staff must
work together to ensure that Keefe is
recognized by our community as a career and
technical school of highquality. We have
improved and will continue to improve our
marketing techniques, our communication
with our school district sending town middle
and high schools, and with our connection to
prospective students and their families.
It is the Superintendent's plan to expand our
career and technical program offerings from a
present level of 14 to our original level of 17
over the next 3 to 5years. This proposed
expansion will take careful planning and
collaboration with our District School
Committee. As a result of our re- organization
of the delivery of education programs that
occurred in the 2010 -11 school year, our
facility is positioned to absorb the planned
growth. Itis the Superintendent'sintent that
our new CTE offerings satisfy the work force
needs of the greater Metro west area.
Buildings and Grounds
The Keefe Regional Technical School opened
its doors in September of1973. As we begin
156
Page 169
Town of Framingham
our 38`'year of operation, the superintendent
reported that he is pleased to report that our
facility is  doing well. Thanks to a
comprehensive energy upgrade that was
completed in 2008, our facility is poised to
move forward without the necessity for major
structural improvements. Our maintenance
and custodial staffs continue to take
ownership for the quality of our building and
grounds. Werecentlycompleted havinga
contractor perform improvements to our 100
foot smoke stack that will improve the
structural integrity of the smoke stack and the
functioning efficiency of our boilers. We
anticipate that future projects for our District
facility will involve a new roof membrane,
parking lot improvements, sealing our
concrete building envelope, and athletic locker
room renovations. The superintendent also
anticipates investigating in the installation of
photo voltaic solar panels on our roof after
the installation of a new roof membrane is
completed. Tobegintheprocess ofcapital
improvements, the Committee authorized the
Superintendent to file a Statement of Interest
with the Massachusetts School Building
Authority (MSBA).
Student Achievement
The District received from the DESE its
annual accountability report detailing Keefe's
Adequate Yearly Progress. Based upon the
AYP criteria which includes: the level of
student participation in the MCAS testing;
meeting state performance targets; attainment
of the District's own improvement target and
achievement of attendance and graduation
targets, Keefe students achieved Adequate
Yearly Progress over all and in all identified
subgroups in English Language Arts (ELA)
and Mathematics. In September all parents or
guardians of Keefe students received the
Keefe Report Card notifying them of this
accomplishment.
In summary, from 2007 to 2010 in ELA the
number of students scoring at proficient or
above increased by 19% while the number of
students failing decreased by 8 %.  For math
Edueation & Libraries 
2011 Annual Report
the number at proficient or higher increased
by 10% while the number failing decreased by
2 %.
In October, the Committee was informed that
according to the 5  level scaling systems
created by the DESE under the Educational
Reform Act of 2010; Keefe has been
categorizedas alevel 1 school. Schoolswith
an NCLB accountability status of "no status"
or "improvement year 1 or 2" are categorized

Level 1  if the highest level of any school in
the district is level 1.
In February Keefe hosted 600 student
participants in the SkillsUSA District
Competition at which our students received 7
gold medals, 10 silver and 3 bronze. As part
of the teamwork's competition, a separate
building construction competition was held in
April at the Royal Trade Center in
Marlborough.
A newly formed Drama Club in March
presented as its first offering, the popular
comedy "Ms. Nelson is Missing ".  The event
was open to students during school hours and
to parents and friends in the evening. The
stage sets were constructed by the vocational
shops and the crew and cast, under the
leadership of Principal Patricia Canali, added a
new dimension to the Keefe experience.

The General Advisory Board consists of the
Chair of each Vocational Advisory Board.
The General Board summarizes and brings to
the attention of the administration and the
School Committee observations and
recommendations of the advisory boards. The
points noted for the current year include: the
need to continually align the curriculum with
changes in technology; outreach to bring
Keefe' s program to potential students;
increasing opportunities for students and
employers in the co -op program; successful
pursuit of grant funding for state -of- the -art
vocational equipment; and maintaining the

Director' s Retirement
Having served the FPL in various capacities
for 17 years, Director Jeanne Kelley
announced her retirement in February, 2012.
The Trustees commended her for the many
contributions she has made to the Library,
including improving customer service;
maintaining staff morale and hiring new staff,
and keeping the Library on an even keel
during difficult times.
A search committee is interviewing applicants
for the Director's position.
Helping to Build the New McAuliffe
Library and Open the Door to Tomorrow
On July 14, 2011, the Massachusetts Board of
Library Commissioners (  MBLC) voted to
place Framingham Public Library ( McAuliffe
Branch) #6 on a waiting list for a provisional
library construction grant of $4.2 million.
With 12,000 patron visits per month,
McAuliffe is the second busiest of the 106
branch libraries inMassachusetts, but among
the smallest of the branch libraries.
McAuliffe's circulation exceeds that of many
main libraries and the facility is too small to
adequately serve the needs of patrons.
Edueation &Libraries 
The preliminary design is for a  one -story
building of about 17,000 square feet, adjacent
to the Nobscot Plaza. The new McAuliffe
Branch Library will provide a larger children's
room, dedicated space for young adults, more
public computers, outlets for laptops, a
meeting room, study rooms, comfortable
reading chairs, easy to reach shelves, an ADA
compliant building, and will be a green LEED
certified building.
The Library will request $3.8 M from the
Town when the grant funding is received,
estimated to be around July 2013. The
Framingham Public Library Foundation's goal
is to raise $600,000 towards this project.
Improving Accessibility
The entrances to the Main Library are not in
compliance with state codes. In April 2011,
Town Meeting allocated $50,000 to prepare a
preliminary design for new entrances. The
Library Trustees engaged Abacus Architects
and Planners of Allston to prepare the
preliminary designs. The FY 2013 Capital
Budget includes a line item for rebuilding the
Lexington Street entrance. The Library will
158
Page 171
Town of Framingham
include the Pearl Street entrance in a future
capital budget.
We appreciate the efforts of Building
Committee Chair Sam Klaidman and the
Trustees, community members, and members
of the Disability Commission who have
worked on this project.
Reaching Out to the Community
We have had a productive and busy year
responding to  community needs and
providing a multitude of varied educational
and enriching programs. For job seekers, we
provided monthly Job Searching Online
workshops, weekly resume help and job
discussion group meetings. In total, 6,429
people attended Adult Programs that were
sponsored by the Library during the last
calendar year.
Highlights of the year included a  very
successful Framingham Reads Together
FRT) program spearheaded by Trustee
Elizabeth Fideler that featured Michael
Shaara's "Killer Angels: A Novel of the Civil
War ". This community wide event offered a
wide selection of programs related to the Civil
War. Currently, a new FRT Committee is
planning the next FRT event to be held in
2013.
Another highlight of the year was the Lifelong
Learning Series collaboration between the
Library and Framingham State University
FSU). Ten scholar -led presentations were
held in the spring and fall at the Library and at
the University. The Adventures in Lifelong
Learning Program, another successful
collaboration with FSU, presented classes for
seniors held on Tuesdays in October. Support
for this project was provided in part by the
MetroWest Health Foundation.
FPL is one of the only libraries in the
Commonwealth to offer Friday evening
programming. The Monthly Friday Night
Film Series, Sunday Concert Series and
Summer Concert Series frequently attracted
Edueation & Libraries 
2011 Annual Report
capacity crowds. Special events have included
programs on varied subjects, as well as author
visits and documentary films. We appreciate
the support received from local businesses
that helped defray the costs of programming
as well as the support of the Framingham
Cultural Council. Most of all, we greatly
appreciate the efforts of Trustee Bob Dodd
for his generous contribution of ideas and
time that have made so many of these events
possible and to the Friends of the
Framingham Library whose efforts help fund
the majority of programs.
The Library continued to do an outstanding
job of meeting the needs of its patrons. In
2011, the Library ranked 6" highest in
circulation out of 370 libraries in the
Commonwealth. A total of 436,613 visits
were made to the Library this year, an average
of 8,396 visits per week. A typical week
recorded 1,848 reference transactions and
1,992 uses of the Internet and electronic
resources. Presently, there are 38,937 residents
with active Framingham Public Library cards.
The Library has been lending e -books and e-
audio books through the Minuteman Library
Network' s Digital Media Catalog since
October of 2009. In 2011, we saw our most
significant increase in e -book circulation to
date, with a 271 % increase from 2010 to 2011.
The Framingham
Foundation 
Public Library
The Framingham Public Library Foundation
has been raising funds for the Main Library
and for the new McAuliffe Branch Library.
The Foundation has already received a
number of donations, plus several substantial
pledges from individual and corporate donors.
See www.orgfplf.for more information about
the Foundation, a 501(c) ( 3) organization.
We thank Jo -Anne Thompson, chair of the
Foundation, the Foundation Board, and other
volunteers for their hard work on behalf of
the Foundation.

CAPITAL BUDGET COMMITTEE
The Capital Budget Committee (  CBC)
consists of six Town Meeting Members
appointed by the Town Moderator, and
one representative from the Finance
Committee. TheroleoftheCBCisto
recommend to Town Meeting for
approval all capital projects with a cost of
at least $25,000 and an expected useful life
of five years. 
This year at the Annual Town Meeting,
the CBC recommended for approval
General Fund projects amounting to
9,583. 053, The source of funding for
virtually all of these General Fund
projects was from bonding, with only
100,000 from freecash. The requested
projects included the following
departments: Building Services/ Capital
Projects, Library, Parks &  Recreation,
Fire, Police, Public Works, Highway,
Sanitation, Schools and Tech Services.
In addition the CBC recommended to
Town Meeting Enterprise Funds projects
totaling $15,473. 187, The projects were
as 
follows: Water Enterprise Fund
3,129608, and Sewer Enterprise Fund
11,344. 579, The sources of funding were
mostly from bonding. A substantial
portion of the bonding projects will be at
interestrates of2% orless. Inaddition,
the Town is hopeful that some stimulus
funding will be received from the Federal
Government.
It was a very challenging year for the
CBC. The Committee made some very
difficult decisions due to limited Town
funds and a never ending list of capital
projects requested by the various Town
departments/ divisions. TheCommittee
plays a very critical role in the long -term
futureoftheTown'sinfrastructure. We
will continue to work closely with the
Chief Financial Officer in order to make
recommendations of projects that benefit
our Town, while maintaining fiscal
responsibility.

Cushing Chapel Advisory
Committee
The Cushing Chapel Advisory Committee
consists of eleven members appointed by

Chapel Advisory Committee is in the
review stage for new and current
applicants via the Board of Selectman.
Some of the projects undertaken this past
year have included the re- glazing of all
windows in the Chapel. This will give a
longer life span to all windows within the
Chapel. Many windows had sustained
damage over the years, and as a result
were replaced to improve the look of the
Chapel.
A major project that was completed
within the Chapel during 2011 was the
repainting of all trim work within the
Chapel. This has improved the aesthetics
of the Chapel and has received many
compliments from Town employees as
well as the public.
The Chapel would like to thank the
Framingham Building Services
department for their continued work on
theChapel. Withouttheiraidethe
improvements that were completed over
the last year would not have been

We would also like to thank and
acknowledge the Framingham Garden

This past July 26" marked the 21"
Anniversary of the passage of the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),a
Federal Civil Rights Law.
The Commission continues to ensure that
the Town is implementing changes
outlined in the 2005 ADA Self -Evaluation
and Transition Plan for municipal
buildings. We continue to work with Town
departments to bring Framingham into
compliance with MA Architectural Access
Board and Federal ADA regulations.
Some access improvements that have been
completed to municipal buildings include:
Village Hall: an accessible walkway
and an automatic door opener.
Nevins Hall stage: an accessible
lift. 
Town Hall: a new accessible ramp
and automatic door opener on the Union
Street side entrance.
The Bowditch Field Athletic Complex
received a  2011 Access Design Award
from the MA Architectural Access Board
and the Boston Society of Architects for
incorporating accessiblity for people with
Disabilities into their design.
Fall Town Meeting approved funds for a
study to bring the Main Library's two
ramps into compliance. Three
Commissioners were asked to serve on
the Library's Building Committee to assist
with the access design of the project.
The Commission had many guest
presenters at our meetings who shared 
2011
valuable information with us:
Alexis Silver, Caregiver Homes of

programs:
5,625 for the Piers Park Adaptive
Sailing program, which taught 15
Framingham children with Disabilities
how to sail.
6,000 toward the Juniper Hill

Finance Committee
The Finance Committee is comprised of
nine members appointed by the Town
Moderator for a term of three years. The
Finance Committee recommends action
to Town Meeting regarding the budget
and other areas of finance. Other key
responsibilities include authorizing
disbursements from the Reserve Fund for
emergency expenses, authorizing deficit
spending for emergency winter- related
expenses, approving the expenditure
ceiling for revolving funds and monitoring
the Town' s annual audit.
The workload for the Finance Committee
requires a commitment of significant time
from the volunteers who serve on it. In
2011, the Committee met 34 times, and
participated in the Annual Town Meeting
and four Special Town Meetings.
Members often have significant
responsibilities beyond regular Finance
Committee meetings. The Committee
provides representatives to the Real
Property and Capital Budget committees
under Town bylaws. In 2011, the Finance
Committee representative to  the
Structural Deficit Review Task Force also
chaired the Task Force. The Committee 
2011
routinely appoints liaisons to Keefe Tech
and the School Department to monitor
their independent budget development
processes. Further, the Committee's three -
member Audit Subcommittee meets with
the Town's outside audit firm and the
Chief Financial Officer' s staff to resolve
audit findings.
This year was characterized by significant
fiscal challenges. Revenue growth was
disrupted due to ongoing unpredictability
in state and federal government revenue
sources, and continuing decline in local
receipts, and new growth in property
taxes. Significant concessions were made
on health care for employees, and for
some collective bargaining units.
However, large expenses such as special
education out -of- district tuition, and
certain collective bargaining agreements
continue to escalate faster than revenue.
In position papers, letters to Town
Meeting, and communications with
municipal and school officials, the
Finance Committee continued to
emphasize the need for the Town to break
the cycle of living beyond its means and to
plan for long -term financial stability. The
Committee recommended that the Town:
Ensure that salaries and benefits
do not grow faster than projected
revenue;
Minimize dependence on non-
recurring revenue sources ( such as
grants, revolving funds, withdraws
or  diversions from the
stabilization fund, free cash, and
stimulus money) to  support
recurring expenses;
Understand and begin to address
unfunded liabilities for post -
employment benefits such as
health care;
General Committees  164
Page 177
Town of Framingham
Annual Report 
Continue to build the stabilization
fund close the gap with the
Town's police goal;
Maximize operational efficiencies
wherever possible, including
consolidations, technology, and
evaluating service delivery such
school choice and custodial
services; and
Review all building use and
potential building needs across the
Town, including the schools, and
develop plans for cost efficient use
and capital planning.
The Finance Committee emphasized the
need to address shrinking revenue growth
and keeping property taxes affordable by
addressing the critical need for
encouraging growth in new construction
and in economic development. Many
recommendations were integrated in some
form into the Structural Deficit Reduction
Task Force's final report.
The Finance Committee' s budget
recommendations targeted immediate
fiscal realities. In FY 2012, the School
Department budget difficulties continued
as  more federal stimulus money
disappeared, and salary increases
negotiated collective bargaining
agreements presented challenges, even
with significant concessions.
The following Reserve Fund
appropriations were made in FY 2011:
50,000 for the Fire Department and
350,000 for Snow and Ice Removal. A
Reserve Fund appropriation of $90,000
was made to the Health Department in
FY2012. Per provisions of MGL, the
Finance Committee authorized deficit
spending for Snow and Ice in FY 2011.

Government Study Committee
The Government Study Committee had
an excellent year. We metten times with
active participation and lively, productive
discussion.
Our major effort this year was focused on
updating the Personnel Bylaw. This bylaw
has been out of date since the
implementation of the Town Manager Act
in 1996. In 2010, Town Meeting rejected
our proposal to eliminate the Personnel
Bylaw section of the General Bylaws. A
proposed update, prepared for fall town
meeting this year by a joint subcommittee
of GSC and SCW &M members, was not
acceptable to town counsel so we
continue to work on therevisions. We
hope to present a  revised proposal to
town meeting for consideration in 2012.
The committee submitted a warrant article
to complete bylaw changes related to the
elimination of the Board of Public Works.
This was approved by Town Meeting.
Discussions were held with the Disability
Commission and the Board of Health
regarding their possible inclusion under
the auspices of Town Meeting standing

committees. Neithergroupfeltthatitwas
appropriate to do so therefore no further
action was taken.
Working with the ZBA, a warrant article
was submitted and approved to allow cell
phone antennae installations on the site of
the Framingham transfer station. Itwas
felt that this would preclude installation
on less desirable sites and have the
potential to provide revenue to the town.
This was approved by Town Meeting.
The GSC continues to work on a proposal
to limit excessive public safety calls;
administrative corrections to the General
Bylaws; and Town Meeting attendance
standards. Forfurtherdetailspleaseread

Historical Commission
In 2011, as in years past, The Framingham
Historical Commission worked on review
of applications for building demolition.
Most properties that we reviewed were
released quickly as being non -significant.
When buildings slated for demolition were
determined to be architecturally or
historically significant, the FHC worked
with the applicants to see if there were
acceptable alternatives to total of partial
demolition.
This past year was a slower year in terms
of building and demolition applications
and the FHC used much of its time
finalizing a  review of Framingham's
existing Demolition DelayBylaw. We
hope to bring a warrant article to the Fall
Town Meeting in 2012 that will afford
those buildings we deem to be significant
added protection against demolition and a
loss of Framingham's rich historic and
cultural past.
We look forward to the challenges ahead
in advocating for the Town's rich heritage.

presentation of "The Laramie Project" at
the High School, and then the possible
ramifications for the community at the
death of Bin Laden. Likewise we have
continued to review the controversy 
2011
surrounding teacher evaluations and
concerns raised by "  The American

impact our community schools. We
sponsored a  lecture presented by Dr.

Technology Advisory Committee
2011 continued to be a challenging year
for the Technology Advisory Committee
TAC).The TAC has an immediate and
long- standing concern that the Town's
Technology Director Position has been
vacant for several years now. In our
personal and business lives we all know
that technology, well applied, can increase
efficiency and decrease costs.
Framingham is saving money in salary by
leaving this position vacant, but we fear
that continued delay in filling this role will
ultimately end up costing the Town more
money. We would note that we respect
and admire the work of the acting
Assistant Director of Technology, Carly
Melo Premo, and appreciate Carly
continuing to maintain a partnership with
the TAC. However, filling the Town's
Technology Director Position needs to be
a priority in early 2011.
In contrast, the School Superintendent's
decision to hire Adam Seldow as
Technology Director in 2008 has yielded
solid benefits for the schools. Adam
Seldow and his team have implemented
server optimization, upgraded core and
wireless networking, and replaced aging
phone systems, to name a few. The TAC
has been pleased to build a partnership
with Adam, consulting and advising as
needed on various technology decisions.
We were sad to see Adam Seldow leave
the district for another position; however,
we were pleased that the Superintendent
sought a replacement very quickly.
In keeping with its charter, the TAC
reviewed the Capital Budget in 2011 and
advised on Capital Technology purchases
and initiatives. The TAC also worked
closely with the subcommittee on
electronic voting to understand the

Framingham's Annual Town Meeting
began on April 26 and met 14 times to
consider a warrant composed of 36
articles which consisted of administrative,
fiscal, policy and zoning articles. The
operating budget for fiscal 2012 saw the
most discussion as Town Meeting
approved an appropriation of
208,303646,for the fiscal year beginning
July 1, 2011. The Capital Budget was also
extensively discussed.
Town Meeting also met on four occasions
for Special Town Meetings. On January
12, Town Meeting met once and discussed
four articles. A Special Town Meeting was
also convened during the annual meeting
on May 5 which met for two nights to
consider six articles. The third Special
Town Meeting was convened on June 21
and met one night to consider 4 articles.
The fourth Special Town Meeting met on
October 18 for three nights to consider 16
articles. Overall, Town Meeting met 21
nights in 2011 to consider a total of 66
articles in fulfillment of its function as the
legislative part of town government.
At every meeting, Town Meeting
members listened carefully, thoughtfully
discussed, debated and voted each of the
articles presented for their consideration.
Town Meeting members this year totaled
212 out of a total of 216 authorized seats
12 seats for each of 18 precincts).Sixteen
precincts had full membership while
openings occurred in precincts 3 (1),10
1), 16 (1),18 (1).
Town Meetings are the result of the
efforts or many different people. A special
Town Meeting 
thank you is owed to the Town Clerk and
her staff. Thanks also go the Board of
Selectmen, the Town Manager and his
staff, the Chief Financial Officer and her
staff, the Building Services Manager and
his staff, Town Counsel and Media
Services. Town Meeting could not happen
without their help and assistance.
Also, many hours are spent by the seven
Town Meeting Standing Committees
Community Services, Education,
Planning and Zoning, Public Safety,
Public Works, Rules and Ways and
Means) and the Moderator appointed
committees (Capital Budget, Finance,
Government Study, Real Property and the
Technology Advisory) discussing and
developing articles to be presented to the
Board of Selectmen for the warrants as
well as discussing warrant articles and
their recommendations to Town Meeting.
Each of these committee members are to
be highly complimented for their time and
dedication to Framingham' s town
government.
Finally, a debt of gratitude is owed to each
Town Meeting member for sharing their
time and talent by volunteering to be
elected Town Meeting members. Their
dedication makes Framingham's
government function and is very much
appreciated.

Aging, Human Relations, Veteran's

Departments or Committees. The
Committee Chair is John Dwyer of
Precinct 1, the Vice Chair is Tom Driscoll
of Precinct 15, and the Clerk position is
currently vacant.
After recent years of activity which
included projects like the new Bowditch
Field, the Callahan Center, and the
continual development of Cushing Park,
the SCCS did not meet during the 2011
year. The meeting called for April 21,
2011 to address the Annual Town
Meeting Articles 1  and 2 concerning the
CDBG programs did not take place due
to a lack of quorum. No other Articles
were assigned to the SCCS by the BOS
during 2011.
It is hoped that 2012 will be a more active
year for the SCCS and that it continues to
serve the Framingham Town Meeting as it
has in the past.

Ned Price, Chair
Standing Committee on Public
Safety
In 2011, the Standing Committee saw a
change in the chairman and we also had a
large amount of turnover within our
membership. We continued our role to
analyze, vote on  and make
recommendations to Town Meeting on
articles relating to the Police, Fire and
Inspectional Services Departments.
The committee met on April 4th with
Police Chief Steven Carl and Deputy
ChiefKenFerguson. ChiefCarldiscussed
in great detail about the Secure
Communities program and how it will be
implemented by 2013, as mandated by
Federal law. Weheard ofthecontinued
constraints of their budget, the concerns
of staffing and not having the amount of
patrol cars they feel that are needed in
patrolling the streets of Framingham.
We also met on April 4th with Fire Chief
Gary Daugherty and Deputy Chief John
Magri to discuss their Town Meeting
requests. The new ladder truck, multi -gas
meters and the defibrillators were
approved. Arequest for the replacement
of Engine 1  was deferred and will be
brought back at the next Town Meeting.
Town Meeting 
2010
The committee met with Mike Foley, the
Director of Building and Inspectional
Services, on April 21 ".  He explained how
his budget has been reduced and how he
needs to do more withless. Thecode
enforcement division has been cut back as
well as the sign officer position, which has
been cut by 50 %.  This drastic cut to an
essential position will surely lead to a
significant challenge for the Inspectional
Services Department as the Sign By -law
requires all signs within the Town to be in
compliance by December 1, 2012.

Standing Committee on Public
Works
The SCPW focused heavily on research
during 2012, with updates being prepared
on issues defined to Town Meeting last
October.
At press time, the SCPW is organizing the
large amount of loosely collated material
requested last November and received in
February from the Dept. of Public Works
DPW).  Included are all  records
concerning out -of -town connections to
the town's sewer system, where located,
dates of agreements, who authorized
them, and how they will impact on our
system.
This data is vital since it took protracted
litigation against Ashland to obtain
adequate payment for use of the town's
sewer system. Moreover, the SCPW is
concerned that the town doesn't fail again
to conduct adequate collections with these
customers as it previously did with those
in Natick. The SCPW is  evaluating
information that indicates there are still
connections to Natick customers that
have not been severed and the town is still
not being paid for this service.

Meanwhile, there are public health issues,
airborne and ground pollution from the
grinding of asphalt, etc. in the area
adjacent to the Birch Road Wells, which
could further contaminate the town's
future water supply. These serious
concerns are supported by extensive
medical research and the recent "Cease
and Desist" order by the town in this
matter.
Other issues being researched will be
reported to Town Meeting as data is
obtained and confirmed.
Respectfully Submitted,
Laurence M. Schmeidler, Chair
Standing Committee on Rules
The Rules Committee meets regularly to
discuss ways of improving the workings
of Town Meeting (TM).We want TM
members to make informed decisions on
motions and have the actions taken
recorded in the Town Meeting Journal.
We request reports at the Annual and
Special Town Meetings based on motions
and resolutions made at Town Meetings
during the previous year and on general
laws. We understand that a question on a
report must be made during discussion of
the department's budget. We would like to
have overhead presentations made at
Town Meeting be clear and visible.
The Rules Committee updated the Town
Meeting Member's Handbook for the
2011 Annual Town Meeting so that it
continues to be a 
useful working
document.
The Rules Committee sponsored an
article at the Fall Town Meeting to rent an
electronic voting system for two years
together with support for a  Voting 
2010
Administrator. The system will include
keypads that have an LED display and
uses enhanced security techniques. This
proposal was approved and will be
available for the 2012 Annual Town
Meeting.
The Rules Committee sponsored a
warrant article to change the bylaw on
Standing Committees to require that
members of a  committee acknowledge
when they are also a member of another
committee that would appear to be a
conflict of interest. The bylaw was
approved.

Joel Winett, Chair
Standing Committee on Ways
and Means
As defined in the Town by -laws, the
Standing Committee on Ways and Means
SCW &M) is responsible for making
recommendations to town meeting ( TM)
on warrant articles sponsored by and /or
related to the Finance Committee, the
Information Services, Finance, and
Human Resources Divisions, and the
Board of Selectmen ( BOS),the Town
Clerk, Town Elections, the Legal
Department, the Retirement Board and
the Capital Budget and Government
Study Committees.
The SCW &M held 23 meetings in 2011 to
work on the budget and warrant articles
for Special Town Meetings ( STM) and the
Annual Town Meeting ( ATM) and met
with article sponsors and those with data,
expertise and perspective pertinent to a
thorough due diligence process.
In collaboration with the Government
Study Committee ( GSC) and with town
counsel's aid, the committee continued
work on article 5 of the fall 2010 STM
Town Meeting  173

Annual Report
which preserved the Personnel Board. An
article will be in the 2012 ATM warrant
proposing bylaw revisions which will
facilitate reports from the personnel board
to town meeting on proposed changes to
compensation and classification plans.
After extensive analyses of both the
proposed compensation plan (ATM article
17) and the consideration of acquiring a
conservation restriction on Eastleigh
Farms, the SCW &M recommended town
meeting refer them both back to the
sponsor. Town meeting concurred. In
both cases the information available
during analysis was inadequate and left
too many questions unanswered. Seeing
this same deficiency overall, the
Moderator urged those involved with
articles to improve the quality and
availability of information required by the
committees to do their work.
In October the CFO discovered a $1.5M
operating budget error and a $1M error in
water and sewer capital stemming from
debt conversion. We participated in a
BOS meeting during which the CFO
outlined how the error occurred and
suggested appropriations to close the
gaps. At the STM, the committee
recommended and town meeting voted to
adopt the CFO's recommendation. 
2010
In an ongoing effort to pursue cost
cutting opportunities which preserve
services, this committee recommended
favorable action to grant the school dept.
permission to enter a five year school
bussing contract which TM approved.
The SCW &M supported the Capital
Budget Committee's recommendations. In
addition, a capital request for $488K for
Memorial Building projects did not get the
committee's or town meeting's support.
The request was void of a strategic plan
for the life and use of the building.

ARTICLE V SECTION 29

Purpose: ItistheintentofthisbylawtoservetheTown'scompellinginteresttopromote,
protect, and improve the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Framingham by
creating areas around locations where children congregate in concentrated numbers
wherein Classified Level 2 and 3 Sex Offenders are prohibited from loitering. After careful
consideration, the Town finds that this bylaw is the most narrowly tailored means of
limiting, to the fullest extent possible, the opportunity for these Sex Offenders to approach
or otherwise come in contact with children in places where children would naturally
congregate, and the protection of the health, safety and welfare of our children is a
compelling interest. The purpose of this bylaw is to reduce the potential risk of harm to
children by impacting the ability for Classified Level 2 and 3 Sex Offenders to be in contact
with unsuspecting children in areas primarily designed for use by or primarily used by
children. It provides an enforcement tool for our police officers to protect children from
potential harm.

RESOLUTION
May 10, 2011 Failed: Be it resolved that it is the will of Town Meeting that the Town, through
the Board of Selectmen, inform the state of the inadequacies in its criminal justice system and
work with our legislators and those of other communities to draft legislation to correct those
deficiencies; to wit:
1. The state must reform the corrections, parole, sex offender classification, and sex
offender registry systems to be more transparent, more responsive to the needs of law
abiding citizens, and more helpful to locallawenforcement. Sexoffendersshouldbe
classified before they are even considered for release, and Level 3 sex offenders should
be considered for "civil commitment" past their sentence length based on provisions in
the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act.
2. The state must increase mandatory minimum sentences for offenses against children, sex
offenders that re- offend, and for all offenders with multiple convictions. 
248
Page 261
3. The state must mandate that the Department of Correction be responsible for inmate
rehabilitation and not count on private contractors to do rehabilitation after the inmate's
release, mandate that no prisoner be paroled without said rehabilitation, ensure that no
prisoner is released if a request for a dangerousness hearing has been made, and mandate
that the chief law enforcement official of the municipality listed as an inmate's residence
or likely residence be informed of the inmate's release if said inmate is a violent offender
or has multiple convictions.
4. The state must stop releasing dangerous criminals before their sentences are complete
absent demonstrable rehabilitation and build a new prison or expand existing prisons if
necessary to relieve overcrowding.
5. The state must increase funding for the prisons and parole departments and develop a
formula for adequate, stable funding in order to ensure that these reforms survive the
vagaries of yearly budget debates.

From: Planning Board
Subject: Planning Board Report to Town Meeting on Article 15, Rezoning of Lands
Date: October 17, 2011
The Planning Board held a Public Hearing on October 6, 2011 to consider Article 15, as provided in the
October 18, 2011 Special Town Meeting Warrant. Through the public hearing process the Article was
amended, and on October 6, 2011, the Planning Board voted 5 in favor and 0 opposed to recommend
favorable action on Article 15 as modified through the public hearing process and as presented in the
handout submitted at Fall Special Town Meeting.
The modification approved by the Planning Board reduces the area of land proposed for B -2 at 7 Lindbergh
Road. Therevised zoning map amendment is as follows.
To see if the Town will vote to amend the Framingham Zoning Map by rezoning the following parcels: 474,
480, 486, 492, 498 and 506 Concord Street, and that portion of Concord Street and Lindbergh Road abutting
said lots to the centerline of Concord Street and Lindbergh Road, and that portion of 7 Lindbergh Road that
is located to the north of a line running parallel 20 feet from the back property line of 9 Lindbergh Road and
continuing along in a straight line to the lot line of 480 Concord Street, from General Business District (B)

Land Area: 14,928 square feet

What B -2 Proposes to do (Framingham Zoning By -Law)
To preserve business uses which serve nearby residential neighborhoods
To foster compact commercial centers served primarily by automobiles, yet accessible and
inviting to pedestrians
To contain general business areas consisting of small shopping centers and commercial strips.
To encourage improved visual quality of commercial development
Allowed uses in B -2 (Framingham Zoning By -Law)
Business by right include all uses permitted in B -1 District, as well as fraternal
organizations, workshops and repair establishments, trade/ professional schools,
health and exercise facilities with not more than 8,000 square feet.
Special permit required for fast food restaurants (drive -thrus are not permitted in B-
2 District),gas stations, indoor entertainment, R &D, off -street parking lots, radio or
T.V. studios, landscapers, conversion of non -commercial structures into boarding
houses, in addition to uses over 8,000 square feet, and uses requiring a special
permit in B -1 District, unless otherwise specified.
Factors to Consider
The General Business District is our most permissive business district allowing 6
story structures, fast food drive -thru facilities and similar intensive uses. In B -2, the
height limitation is 3 stories or 40 feet. 
267
Page 280
The nonconforming uses in the residentially zoned portion of the properties have
been in existence for several decades. Conditions of any existing variances on the
site are in all likelihood limited in protecting the abutting residential properties.
In the B -2 District no individual establishment or building shall exceed 8,000 square
feet in gross floor area per establishment or building without special permit
approval.
In the B -2 District no individual establishment shall exceed50,000 square feet in
gross floor area and no building shall exceed 60,000 square feet in gross floor area
per.
For redevelopment project, the Planning Board requires Applicant's to make
significant on -site improvements, including but not limited to, landscape buffers
and screening, as well as off -site traffic improvements.
The proposed rezoning to B -2 would encourage uses that are more compatible with
residential neighborhoods than the current General Business District.
Land Use Policy Plan
Policy 3: Protect and enhance the character of the Town's business by establishing a hierarchy of
business districts in the zoning bylaw with development standards appropriate to the differing
roles played by the Town's commercial centers.
Policy 8: Improve the efficiency and environment of business areas by upgrading zoning
standards to encourage concentrated rather than strip development, lessen traffic congestion,
reduce the need for auto travel between activities, and avoid incompatible uses.
Policy 42: Encourage improved visual quality of commercial development.
Community Meetings and Public Hearing
Community Meeting was held on September 20, 2011 with approximately 15
attendees. Notices were sent to every household on Lindbergh Street and
Hampshire Road and to businesses and residences on Concord Street in the
immediate vicinity of the properties to be rezoned.
Planning Board Public Hearing was held on October 6, 2011 at 7:45 in the Ablondi
Room at the Memorial Building, 150 Concord Street.
The Planning Board Director met directly with the owners of the properties
proposed to be rezoned.
Notice of the public hearing was sent to residents adjacent to the properties to be
rezoned.
Public Comment— Based on the October 6, 2011, Planning Board Public Hearing
A resident expressed his concern with the proposed layout of 7 Linburgh Street and
suggested a lot line shift furter over to allow more of the lot to remain in the
residential zone. 
268
Page 281
Residents from Hampshire Road asked questions about the size of the required
buffer zones, safty issues with increased traffic on roadways and 24 hour
establishments coming to thae area.
Concern with the unknown possibilities of what kind of development could occur at
this location.
Comments were also made in support of the proposed zoning amendment
Recommendation
The Planning Board recommends that the properties in question be zoned from
General Business (B) District and Single Family Residential (R -1) District to
Community Business (B -2) District.
The Planning Board recommends that the B -2 District designation include the entire
portion of these properties, and that the rear portion of the lots not be zoned R -1
District, except for a portion of 7 Lindbergh Road. These are relatively small parcels.
On -site parking should be available to serve the commercial uses.
These properties have less opportunity forimprovement, due tothe current split
zoning. The proposed
B -2 District zoning would likely facilitate re- development of these parcels over time
with neighborhood based services and provide needed increased tax revenues to the
town.
Any future redevelopment of these properties under the B -2 would provide the
opportunity for the Planning Board through the review process to require
substantial site improvements such as, but not limited to: buffering and screening of
parking areas and other business related operations from residential areas, as well as
streetscape improvements, pedestrian improvements, and off -site traffic
improvements.
Based on the public hearing, the Planning Board recommends a modification to the
proposed zoning map amendment under Article 15, in order to retain a greater
portion of the property at 7 Lindbergh Road in the R -1 District, as shown on the
revised zoning map handout.
