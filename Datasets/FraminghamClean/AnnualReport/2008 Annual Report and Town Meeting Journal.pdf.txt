TOWN OF IFRAmINGHAM
MASSACHUSETTS
Annual Report
Year Ending December 31, 2008
Framingham's Town Seal: In the year 1900, the Framingham Town Seal was redesigned
for the Town's bicentennial to recognize our community's prominence in education and
transportation. The Framingham State Normal School, a free public school and the first of
its kind in America, is representedby the structure at the top of the design. Governor
Danforth, the founder of Framingham and owner of much of its land, is acknowledged by
the words " Danforth' s Farms 1662" on the shield at the center. The wheel on the shield
with spokes drawn as tracks radiating in six different directions represents the steam and
electric railroads and signifies the Town's position as a transportation hub. Surrounding the
words "Town of Framingham Incorporated 1700" is an illustrative border of straw braid,
which honors the prominent role Framingham played in the manufacture of hats and
bonnets in the 1800s.

2008 Annual Report
KX CWNU, 1  HUMAN ]AFSOUR
L to R: Jason Smith ( Chair), Laurie Lee, Charles Sisitsky
Clerk),Ginger Esty (Vice Chair),and Dennis Giombetti
The Board of Selectmen had a busy and
productive 2008, meeting 47 times and
addressing a wide variety of critical issues
facing the Town of Framingham. The
Board's goals in fiscal year (FY) 2009 were
centered on five broad categories:
Community /Economic Development, Long -
Term Capital Infrastructure Needs,
Transportation, Administration, and
Neighborhood Services.
For Community /Economic Development,
the Board has been working with professional
staff on creating a Foreclosure Action Plan
and on implementing the Housing Plan. In
response to numerous complaints from
concerned citizens and business owners, the
Board authorized a  parking study to be
conducted in the Town. This study, set to be
unveiled in early 2009, will present findings
andrecommendations to theBoard. The
current two -hour town -wide limit will be
addressed and options such as resident -only
parking decals will be considered. The Board
hopes to implement some or all of the
recommendations in the study in a timely
manner.
General Government 
In the area of Long -Term Capital
Infrastructure Needs, the Town hired Doug
Goddard as the Town's Capital Buildings
Project Manager in December 2008. Doug
will work with the Town's Building Services
staff along with staff from the School's
Building &  Grounds Department to assess
and address the needs of the aging stock of
Town -owned buildings. Some of Doug's
collaborative efforts have led to attic
insulation in the Memorial Building and work
on improving the building's dilapidated front
steps. The Board also held discussions with
the School Committee on the future of the
Maynard Building.
The Board' s work on its  goal of
Transportation in 2008 included having
discussions with the Metrowest Regional
Transit Authority (MWRTA) to ensure that
the needs of Framingham residents and
visitors are being addressed. Thisincludes
ensuring that the services currently being
provided by the Ride are available to members
ofthe disabled community. The Board is also
concerned about the rail crossing going
through downtown Framingham and has
stepped up the efforts of the Downtown Rail
Crossing Committee to come up with a plan
to address the downtown traffic problem.
This includes working with CSX to have them
move their freight yards out of the current
locations.
Inthearea ofAdministration, the Board was
pleased to concur with the Town Manager
and welcome Gary Daugherty as the Town's
new Fire Chief. The Board also adopted new,
stricter alcohol rules and regulations in an
effort to make Framingham a 
safer
Page 15
Town of Framingham
community. These regulations included input
from the business community to ensure their
opinionswere heard. Members oftheBoard
along with Town staff also had various
meetings with State and Federal officials to
discuss funding for the Town. These
included meetings with Governor Deval
Patrick to discuss local aid cuts, Lt. Governor
Timothy Murray to discuss the impacts of
expanding rail service on downtown
Framingham traffic, Congressman Edward
Markey to discuss the downtown rail crossing,
and our legislative delegation to discuss State
funding and the priorities of the Town.
Significant time was also spent defending the
Town from a federal lawsuit brought forth by
the South Middlesex Opportunity Council
SMOC). The special appropriation allocated
by Town Meeting to defend this suit has been
well spent and to date numerous claims
against the Town and certain officials have
been dismissed from the suit altogether. 
2008 Annual Report
In terms of Neighborhood Services, the
Board continues to support code enforcement
efforts in our Town to avoid blight and unsafe
livingconditions. Wehave alsoworkedwith
the Framingham Housing Authority to
support their efforts to renovate their housing
stock.
Finally, the Board would like to offer a sincere
thank you to the many dedicated individuals
who work so diligently to make Framingham
sucha rich andwonderful community. From
senior town officials to front line employees
to elected and appoint board, committee, and
commission members, the Town has a
dedicated and highly professional group of
people working on itsbehalf. We look
forward to continued progress on the
aforementioned issues and others in 2009.
Respectfully Submitted,
Jason A. Smith, Chair
Town M
I am pleased to present this Town Manager's
Report for Framingham for calendar year
2008. This Report is only intended to be a
brief summary of selected activities; it is not
intended to be totallycomprehensive. For a
more complete summary of highlights, feel
free to refer to the State of the Town Report
which I presented to the Board of Selectmen
on February 24, 2009.
During this year, we experienced several
transitions inmanagement staffpositions. In
the first quarter of 2008, Alison Steinfeld was
hired as the Town's new Director of
Community & Economic Development. As a
part of her important duties and
responsibilities, Alison was also designated as
Framingham's Downtown Director, broadly
overseeing and coordinating all Town projects
and development - related programs in the
Downtown area. In September, Ethan
Mascoop began his duties as the Town's new
General Government 
Director of Public Health. In November, Fire
Chief 011ie Gadson retired after 32 years of
service to the Department, the last three as
Chief. Deputy Chief Al Ordway served as
interimFireChieffor a 
fewmonths. Gary
Daugherty was appointed Fire Chief in
December after a rigorous search, including a
formal assessment center process. Chief
Daugherty was set to begin his duties officially
on January 24, 2009. In December, Capital
Building Projects Manager Doug Goddard
was hired to fill this newly- created position
approved by Town Meeting. It is a "hybrid"
position, serving both the Town and School -
side buildings and for the first time takes a
comprehensive approach to the Town /School
working together to properly steward the large
number of public buildings in the community.
From a public safety standpoint, the police
department received a total of 47,376 actual
calls for service requiring a response during

2008. Total motor vehicle accidents requiring
a police investigation was 1 The fire
department handled a total of 19,078 requests
for service in 2008, including 9,502 emergency
calls for service and 9,576 non -emergency
requests for service /assistance. On April 11,
the Fire Department responded to a major
fire in the Jefferson Village complex on
Temple Street. This majorincidentrequired
the use of multiple ladder companies to
remove trapped persons 
from this large
structure. The Police Department, the
Department of Public Works, mutual aid fire
responders from surrounding communities,
and representatives from the Building
Inspection Division all worked in tandem in
response to this public safety emergency.
A Housing Foreclosure Action Plan was
developed which was approved by the Board
of Selectmen, addressing three major aspects
of housing foreclosures: (  1) Foreclosure
prevention; (2) Management of foreclosed
property; and (  3) Stabilization of
neighborhoods affected by foreclosure and
abandonment. The Framingham Housing
Authority is a major partner in this overall
foreclosure effort. The Town has applied for
federal grant funds in the amount of $1.6
million to undertake this comprehensive
effort. This program represents an excellent
collaborative effort involving the Building
Inspection Division and the Community and
Economic Development Division.
In the second half of 2008, Framingham
secured a $12.9 million Life Sciences Grant
from the Commonwealth, allowing the re-
construction of a major sewer line and some
water facilities serving Technology Park and
the expansion of a  wastewater pumping
station to serve Genzyme and other
companies within Tech Park. This will result
in significant new hi -tech job creation within
Framingham, and the many additional
ancillary economic development benefits this
creates for those local businesses that serve in
a support role as vendors and suppliers.
General Government 
2008 Annual Report
The Department of Public Works completed
the Water Street and Saxonville Sewer Line
construction and will be starting the waterline
construction thisyear on WaterStreet. The
project was one of the Massachusetts
Department of Environmental Protection
MADEP) Administrative Consent Order
ACO) projects and eliminated a 
long-
standing Sanitary Sewer Overflow (  SSO)
furtherupstream inthesystem. Theproject
was completed on schedule with the ACO,
which is in its second year, and was completed
within the funds appropriated. Further
completed as part of this ACO requirement
was 
construction of the new Fenwicke
Wastewater Pumping Station on Central
Street, which eliminated a significant amount
of groundwater filtration from entering the
system. Keep in mind that this ACO
mandates well over $200 million in capital
projects in water and sewer that the Town
must undertake pursuant to the Federal Clean
Water Act to correct many years 
of
insufficient maintenance investment in the
Town's water /sewer infrastructure. Public
Works has also contracted out for the
acquisition of the Automated Meter Reading
System and has begun the process of
installation. When completed in early 2010,
this project will provide real -time on- demand
water meter readings and will dramatically
improve the efficiency and accuracy of water
and sewer billing.
The reconstruction of the Franklin Street
arterial corridor was initiated with a formal
ground- breaking ceremony."Approximately
35% of this $7.5+ million State and Federal
funded project has been completed. Public
Works finished a year of challenging snow
and ice control operations for the winter of
2007 -2008, this resulting in a $1.6 million
deficit beyond the funds appropriated by
Town Meeting forthatpurpose. The deficit
was successfully "retired" during the second -
halfofcalendar year2008. However, the
beginning of winter 2008 -2009 has presented
an equally significant demand on the Town's
snow and ice funds forthe currentyear. By 
3

Town of Framingham
year end 2008, the Town had already
accumulated another snow and ice deficit
exceeding $1million which will again present a
considerable challenge to deal with moving
into calendar year 2009.
The Building Services Department has
completed overseeing the installation of a
new, highly energy efficient replacement
boiler for the Memorial Building. This has
resulted in considerable energy savings for
Town Hall heating operations. Also regarding
buildings, negotiations were successfully
concluded and a significant portion of the
Town -owned Danforth Building was
occupied by the Boys & Girls Club which is
now the long -term lessee of this Town -owned
property. Occupying the former Boys & Girls
Club space at the old Fire Station on Hollis
Street is the Amazing Things Performing Arts
Center, also having completed a long -term
lease with the Town.
As we know, all local and state governments
are being profoundly affected by the national
economic downturn which we are
experiencing. Inthelastquarterofcalendar

The Framingham Town Clerk's office is the
largest joint clerk /election operation in
Massachusetts. We are also one of the busiest
Clerk's offices in the state. The presence of a
birthing hospital, numerous nursing homes
and assisted living facilities and a population
of over 66,000 residents contribute to the
substantial work load.
The Town Clerk Division is responsible for
creating and preserving all the Town's vital
records. Assistant Town ClerkLisa Ferguson
manages our daily operations. Lisa trains,
supervises and works with staff to ensure that
we meet alldeadlines. Lisa's knowledge,
experience, positive attitude and extraordinary
work ethic provide an excellent example for
staff.
General Government 
2008 Annual Report
year 2008, in 
response to a  significant
decrease in Town revenues, I initiated a freeze
on all hiring for non -essential staff positions
within the Town and a companion spending
freeze on all operating spending which could
reasonably be deferred until longer -term
revenue trends stabilize. It  is  our
responsibility as public servants to operate
within available revenues and to manage
Town affairs in a reasonable, cost -effective
manner.
I am grateful to the Board of Selectmen for
their leadership and support during 2008. I
commend the Division and Department
heads comprising Framingham's excellent
administrative team for their commitment and
collaborative spirit during the year just
completed. IalsothankTownMeetingfor
your communication, engagement and budget
support for the many Town services which we
are privileged to deliver to fellow residents of
Framingham.
Respectfully Submitted,
Julian M. Suso, Town Manager
In May, I  promoted administrator Chris
Sullivan to Election Coordinator and we
welcomed our new administrator Emily Black.
Emily and veteran administrator Lauren
DiGiandomenico process vital records. They
registered and issued 1712 birth certificates,
634 death certificates, 505 marriage licenses,
3252 dog licenses and 550 business certificates
in 2008. Other administrative responsibilities
include: collecting fines for the Board of
Health, Conservation Commission, Building
and Public Works departments and Animal
Control; filing Zoning Board of Appeals,
Planning Board and Historic Commission
decisions; conducting genealogy searches and
posting meetings and meeting minutes. Our
2008 revenues were $ 202,899. Emily and

Town of Framingham
Lauren worked at an intensive pace this year
to meet our Town Clerk deadlines because
Lisa, Chris and I were often focused on the
2008 elections. Their efforts were
exceptional.
The Election Division is responsible for
conducting the Annual Town Census and all
elections. Town Meetingoriginaldocuments
and votes are filed in our office. We prepare
the Attorney General Bylaw submissions and
post the bylaws when they are approved.
2008 was an unusually busy election cycle,
especially for a new Election Coordinator and
Chris performed superbly. Chris registered
4706 people, deleted 5252 voters and
amended 9271 records in preparation for the
November 5th Presidential Election. 27,085
people voted in this election, the largest
turnout in Framingham's history.
Election preparation begins months before an
election and in the case 
of the 2008
Presidential Election it began in 2007 when
Superintendents Gene Thayer and Peter
Dewar agreed to close schools on Election
Day. This alleviated parking and traffic
concerns. We received supportand assistance
throughout the process. Jim Egan and the
Building Services staff set up and broke down
polling locations. The Police Department
provided additional traffic details at the
busiest polling locations. Keefe Tech
Superintendent Jim Lynch cancelled classes
and swim team practices on election night to
ensure adequate parking for voters. We are
not charged to use Keefe or St. Tarcisius
Parish Center as polling locations; nor are we
charged to park in St. Stephen's lot on
election days. Town Accountant, Richard
Howarth and his staff, Judy Moore, Shirley
Tibbert and Lynn Porter facilitated the
processing of the election payroll and 
2008 Annual Report
expenses which is extremely time- consuming
forusafterabigelection. Thisassured that
our election workers would be paid in a timely
manner for the sixteen hour day they worked.
We also conducted the Presidential Primary
on February 5th. The turnout was 36 %.  16%
voted in the Town Election on April 1st and
19% voted in the State Primary in September.
The Annual Town Meeting met over twelve
nights in April and May. Members voted on
51 articles and approved nine resolutions. Six
Special Town Meetings were held on March
18, April 30, two on June 24, October 28 and
December 18th.
The Board of Selectmen has named me as the
Town liaison to the U.S. Census Bureau for
the2010Federal Census. Lisa and I  are
participating in ongoing training to ensure
that Census 2010 is  a  success for
Framingham.
Many people have contributed to our success.
Town employees are professional,
knowledgeable and always willing to help. The
Board of Selectmen, Town Officials and
Town Meeting members provide consistent
support to this office; it is a genuine pleasure
to work with them and with all those who
participate in our government. Our poll
workers continue to work long days to ensure
that the public is well served when they vote.
Finally and most importantly I  thank and
commend my small, dedicated staff for their
hard work, professionalism and friendly
attitudes when dealing with the public. They
exemplify the Town's commitment to
excellent customer service.

Valerie Mulvey, Town Clerk

Town of Framingham  2008 Annual Report
Introduction & Overview
Petrini & Associates, P.C. ( "P &A ")is pleased
to provide the 2008 Annual Report of the
Office of the Town Counsel. P &A operates
the Office of the Town Counsel in
accordance with Article II, Section 5 of the
General Bylaws. WerepresenttheTownin
various litigation in which the Town is
involved, and appear on behalf of the Town
before all courts and administrative agencies
of the Commonwealth. In addition, we serve
as a liaison and a resource to various special
counsel and insurance counsel representing
the Town in a variety of legal matters. We
also attend meetings of all boards, committees
and commissions of the Town that we are
requested to attend. P &A also drafts legal
documents for Town officials, boards and
commissions upon request, and reviews legal
contracts, deeds and agreements to which the
Town is a  party. We provide advice and
opinions to the Board of Selectmen, Town
Manager, and various division heads and
department heads in accordance with the
Town bylaws and the Policy for Access to
Town Counsel.
In our capacity as Town Counsel, we also
attend the Annual Town Meeting and all
special town meetings, and we are available to
provide opinions at such meetings upon
request. We also review all non -petition
warrant articles prior to inclusion in the
warrant, and also are available to review and
comment upon written motions submitted in
advance in conjunction with specific warrant
articles.
Over the past several years, the litigation in
which the Town is named as a party has
grown in volume, scope and complexity. We
historically have found that a variety of the
Town's features make it  attractive to
developers, social service agencies, and
corporations and these proponents usually
General Government 
pursue theirproposed projects vigorously. If
the proponents' development projects are not
permitted by our land use boards, the
proponents often expend substantial
resources to challenge the denial of the
permits in court. Litigation filed in recent
years by Paulini Loam, Nexum, Great Brook
Valley Health Center, Inc. and South
Middlesex Opportunity Council, Inc., all
discussed in further detail below, constitute
recent examples ofthis. Thisofficehas
continued to handle the Town's increasingly
complex and heavy volume of litigation with
efficiency, focus and positive results.
Included in Section II of this report is a
comprehensive list describing the status of
litigation active in 2008, as required by Article
II, Section 5.8  of the General Bylaws.
Included in Section III of this report is a
Budgetary Overview section that summarizes
the revenue, mitigation and avoided expenses
that this office has helped achieve for the
Town in 2008.
Positive accomplishments which this office
achieved or helped to achieve in 2008 include
the following:
1) In July of 2008, the Federal District
Court of Massachusetts granted the Town's
Motion for Summary Judgment on the issue
of whether the Town effectively established a
24 -day work period pursuant to 29 U.C.S.
207(k).By virtue of the Court's ruling (which
the plaintiffs are expected to appeal) the
Town has avoided potentially substantial
damages, which could have totaled more than
1,000500, given the substantial damages
imposed by the courts for FLSA violations,
including double damages, full attorneys' fees
and costs.
2) The Town continued to receive the
benefits of an Intermunicipal Agreement

of 2008 seeking to enjoin the Town's enforcement of the Sign Bylaw with respect to
multiple business signs ( "MBS ") owned by Walmart on Route 9 and Route 30.
Bugaboo leased advertising panels onbothMBS signs. Atthe same time itfiled the

and the Court has scheduled a summary judgment hearing inMay of2009. Ifthe
Town succeeds on its motion for summary judgment, this case will be resolved in its
favor, with the exception of a possible appeal. If the Town's motion for summary
judgment is denied, a trial will be required.
This action was filed against the Town in 2005 by approximately 100 Framingham
patrol officers alleging that the Town failed to appropriately compute and pay
overtime wages as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA),29 U. S.C.
201 -219. The Town contends that it complied with the FLSA pursuant to
payments made to the officers under the terms of the parties' collective bargaining
agreement. Animportant issue inthiscase istheproperworkperiodtobeusedin
calculating required overtime sums. The Town contends that atallrelevant times it
had an established 24 -day work period whereby the officers were entitled to FLSA
overtime only for time worked in excess of 147 hours over a 24 -day work period, in
accordance withaformulasetforthunderapplicable federalRegulations. The
officers have argued that the operative threshold should be 40 hours within a given
week, such that they would be entitled to overtime pay for all hours worked in
excess of 40 each week. The Town moved for summary judgment on this key issue
early in 2008. On July 2, 2008, the Court issued an order that the Town had
effectively established a 24 -day work period under the FLSA. This decision
represents an important victory for the Town, potentially saving it from substantial
liability. The officers areexpected to appeal the Court's ruling to theUnited States
Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, either after a trial of the remaining issues or
pursuant to a settlement agreement that may be entered into between the Town and
the officers, if settlement terms can be agreed upon
This matter involves the Conservation Commission' s efforts to enforce wetlands
violations committed by William Carney of32ParkerRoad. The Commission
found that Mr. Carney had clear cut numerous trees and dumped brush within a
wetlands resource area located on 28 Parker Road, 30 Parker Road, and 32 Parker
Road. The Commission issued an enforcement order on April 2, 2008, and an
amended enforcement order on June 4, 2008. Mr. Carney appealed the enforcement
order(s) to the Superior Courtunder the certiorari statute, G.L. c. 249, Â§ 4. This
office recently filed the record of proceedings in this case and served a motion to
dismiss Mr. Carney's Superior Court appeal on the grounds that it was not timely
filed. We are awaiting receipt of Mr. Carney's opposition to such motion, and will
file the same upon receipt in accordance with Court rules.
Action before the Superior Court seeking to enjoin Town from discontinuing trash
pick -up. Town filed a counterclaim to recover cost of services provided. In 2003,
summary judgment entered in favor of Town on all of plaintiffs' counts, as well as
on its counterclaims. Approximately $100,000 in escrow funds were released to
Town upon receipt of the favorable summary judgment decision. In 2004, the
Superior Court awarded the Town judgment in excess of $300,000 on its
counterclaim afterathree day assessment ofdamages hearing. Althoughthe
plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Appeals Court, they withdrew their appeal
upon the parties' settlement of this case in the Spring of2008. Under the terms of
the settlement, the Town received $300,000 and an agreement by the plaintiffs that
the Town is not required to provide curbside trash collection to the plaintiffs, in
accordance with the terms of the applicable DPW policy.
Coviello Electric & General Contracting, Inc.,the apparent low bidder on a bid for
streetlight maintenance, brought a bid protest against the Town after the Town
rejected all bids on a street light maintenance contract. The Town rejected the bids
because it has inadvertently used the wrong invitation to bid when the Town sought
bids for the project. The Town then revised the RFP and rebid the project, arguing
that the new bid invitation contained substantial modifications between the original
mistakenbidandthenewbid specifications. Oneparticularmodification tothe
new bid was that the Town wanted the vendor to have the online capability to track
malfunctioning street lights. Coviello filed abidprotestwiththeoffice ofthe
Attorney General, contending that there were no material differences between the
first and second bids and that it was entitled to award of the contract by virtue of its
status as lowest responsible bidder on the initial bid. After hearing the parties'
arguments at a hearing July 17, 2008, the Attorney General's office allowed the

protest, in part on the basis of its conclusion that it was not clear whether a tracking
system that was email -based as proposed by Coviello would not meet the stated
needs. After this decision, the Town awarded the contract to Coviello. This matter
is now closed.
The plaintiffs, Cheryl B. Cramer and Carol L. Bosworth, appealed a special permit
granted by the Planning Board to Staples, Inc. for land clearing under Section
IV.114 oftheZoningBylaw. Stapleswasgrantedthespecialpermitforlandlocated
at 225 Crossing Boulevard in Framingham in order to remove trees and clear a
portionoftheproperty forsnowstorage. Since Staplesistherealpartyininterestin
this case, and in accordance with longstanding policy, the Board of Selectmen and
Town Counsel has allowed Staples to defend its special permit and has not taken an
activeroleinthiscase toconserve resources. TheCourthasscheduled afinalpre-
trial conference for April 16, 2009. This office will continue to monitor this
litigation as it proceeds.
This case involved an appeal from the decision of the Zoning Board denying a
specialpermit forproperty located at561 Hollis Street. The applicant soughtto
convert the use of the existing building on the property from its current use as a first
floor restaurant with two apartments on the upper floors, to three dwelling units
withoutarestaurant. The existing structure was nonconforming astofrontsetback
and minimum landscaped open space surface ratio. The restaurant use isalso
nonconforming in the zoning district, which is General Residence. The application
for a special permit failed on a vote of two members in favor and one opposed.
Dicenso appealed and sought to remand the matter to the Board for reconsideration
as a finding under G.L. c. 40A Â§6 for alteration of a nonconforming use, which
requires only a majority vote. After the remand, the application was granted. The
parties filed a stipulation of dismissal in January, 2008, and this case is now closed.
Direct Capital Corporation (Direct Capital) brought this complaint against the Town
and filed a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin the Town from transferring
the liquor license ofKenneco Inc. Uponreceipt ofthe complaint and motion for
preliminary injunction to our office, we advised Direct Capital's counsel that the
Board of Selectmen had recently denied Kenneco Inc.' s application for renewal of
their liquor license for 2008. Therefore, we argued that there was no need for Direct
Capital to seek to enjoin the Town of Framingham from transferring Kenneco Inc.' s
license to a new entity because, in fact, Kenneco Inc.' s license would cease to exist
after December 31, 2007. After some initial reluctance, Direct Capital ultimately
agreed to voluntarily dismiss the Town of Framingham from the case. (Direct
Capital's litigation against Kenneco Inc. presumably continued forward).
This arbitration arises from a grievance filed by Local 1652, the Framingham
Firefighter's Union, regarding Firefighter Farrell's transfer and discipline
concerning useofswapped shifts. TheFire Department reached asettlement with
Mr. Farrell and Local 1652 in advance of an arbitration hearing scheduled for March
2, 2009.
This action involved a bid protest by Federal Corporation in connection with the
Town's intention to award its pump station replacement contract for the Ransom
Road Pump Station to the apparent lowest responsible bidder, L.M. Holdings, LLC.
Federal Corporation alleged thatL.M. did not comply with the precise percentage
bid requirements with respect to minority and women business participation, and
failed to submit the requisite form showing M/WBE participation as required under
the bid documents On February 12, 2009, the Attorney General's Office issued a
decision denying Federal Corp.' s bid protest and affirming the Town's award of the
contract as fully compliant with minority and women business participation
requirements. The contract was awarded to L.M. Holdings and the matter is now
closed.
Local 1652, the Framingham Firefighters Union, filed a grievance regarding the
inception date on which an injured firefighter begins to receive injured on duty
benefits provided for under G.L. c. 41, Â§ Â§100 and 111F. During a mediation held
on February 14, 2008, the parties agreed to a settlement whereby firefighters
claiming to have been injured on duty would not have to use their health benefits but
would be immediately indemnified by the Department for medical costs incurred in
connection with the alleged injury. As part of the settlement, the Fire Department
agreed to a time frame within which the Chief would make his G.L. c. 41, Â§ 111F

determinations.
The Framingham Police Officers Union (FPOU) filed this unfair labor practice
charge with the Massachusetts Labor Relations Commission, now the Division of
Labor Resources (DLR),following the Town's issuance of correspondence to the
FPOU in April of 2007 reaffirming the existence of the Town's 24 -day work period
pursuant to 29 USC 207(k) ofthe Fair Labor Standards Act. The Townprepared a
responsive submission and moved to stay this matter pending the outcome of the
Calvao v. Framingham FLSA federal court litigation in which the Court has
determined the effectiveness of the Town's establishment of the 24 -day work
period. In November of 2007, the DLR administratively closed this matter without
prejudice, allowing the FPOU six months to initiate the charge. The FPOU recently
sentalettertothe DLR formally withdrawing thischarge. This matterisnow
closed.
The Framingham Police Officer Union filed a charge of a prohibited practice with
the DLR and a separate demand for arbitration alleging that the Town violated its
duty to bargain when the Police Department mandated that officers generate all
writtenreports viacomputer. The Townfiled awrittenresponse tothecharge. The
parties subsequently reached anagreement inprinciple to settle the matter. Town
Meeting declined toapprove thefunding ofasettlement. Boththearbitration and
the ULP subsequently were withdrawn by the Union in connection with the
subsequent settlement and funding of a collective bargaining agreement between the
Town and the FPOU.
In 2007 Patrolman Eduardo Rivera filed a demand for arbitration appealing a
disciplinary suspension. TheTownfiledanactioninMiddlesex SuperiorCourtto
enjoin the arbitration on the grounds that the CBA expressly provides that the proper
forum to appeal disciplinary decisions is the Civil Service Commission rather than
via arbitration. On January 18, 2008, the Superior Court granted the Town's motion
for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the arbitration. This case is still pending, and
the arbitration proceeding has been stayed pending the final outcome of the Superior
Court case.
In this case Richard Freni, a candidate for a Framingham Police Officer position,
was bypassed for a job with the Town based upon evidence of poor performance at
his prior employment. Mr. Freni filed an appeal of his bypass with the Civil Service
Commission. TheCommissiondismissedthismatterforfailure toprosecuteafter
Mr. Freni failed to appear at a hearing on March 7, 2008. This matter is now closed.
These cases were brought in federal and state court, respectively, in connection with
the Planning Board's denial ofthe Plaintiffs' applications for a series of special
permits todevelop aproposed healthcenter onWaverly Street. Theparties agreed
to a settlement of both cases in late 2007 /early 2008, and both cases are now closed.
This action was an appeal by Mr. Bart Guerreri under G.L. c. 40A, Â§ 17 of a ZBA
decision appealing a determination of the Town of Framingham Building
Commissioner concerning property located at76 Carter Drive. The ZBA moved to
dismiss the case for failure to comply with the requirement that notices of appeal be
filed with the Town Clerk and the Court within 20 days of the filing of the ZBA's
decision. The Court allowed the motion to dismiss in April of 2008. This case is
now closed.
This case involved an appeal of the Zoning Board's grant of a special permit to
Chipotle Mexican Grill for a restaurant to be located at 85 Worcester Road. The
special permit was appealed by an abutter, Hanna Management and Development
Trust and Ken's Steak House, Inc. Since Chipotle Mexican Grill is the real party in
interest, the Town took a passive role in the defense of this case, and instead
allowed the real party in interest, Chipotle, to defend the challenged permit.
Ultimately, Chipotle's decided not to defend the special permit. Thereafter, the
Land Court issued a decision allowing Hanna Management's motion for judgment
onthe pleadings and enteringjudgment inits favor. This case isnowclosed.

report in further detail in the next annual report.
The Zoning Board of Appeals granted a special permit pursuant to G.L. c. 40B for
the applicant to construct an elderly affordable housing project on Edmands Road.
Abutters andneighbors filed anappealinthe Land Court. The Court dismissed the
appeal for lack of standing in accordance with the Supreme Judicial Court's ruling
in Standerwick v. Andover Zoning Board of Appeals The plaintiffs appealed the
dismissal and the Appeals Court issued a decision on November 30, 2007 affirming
theLand Court'sdecision. The Plaintiffs filed apetitionforrehearing withthe
Appeals Court andtheAppeals Court denied thepetitioninMay of2008. This
matter is now closed.
In this arbitration, Local 1652 alleges that the Fire Department has not
beenpaying wages properly. Among the salientissues iswhether the
underlying payment is required to be made on a daily day or weekly basis.
The Town's position is that it has paid firefighters properly in accordance
with the parties' past practice. This arbitration is scheduled for April 17,
2009. Theparties recently reached asettlement agreement inprinciple
whereby the Union will agree to dismiss this arbitration with prejudice
upon approval of the FY 2008 CBA settlement between the Town and
Local 1652.
Local 1652 filed this grievance in 2006 to protest the Department's calling of a
promotional exam in November 2006 after holding a similar exam in November
2005. The union'sposition wasthatitwas anestablished pastpractice tohold
promotional exams only once every two years. The Town'sposition was thatitwas
a management right to schedule promotional exams as needed, and that the
Department was required by law to call the exam to fill an open lieutenant's
position. Members oftheunion didnotapply totakethe examination anditwas
canceled. The union subsequently agreed towithdraw the grievance because no
members took the exam.
In response to the events leading up to the cancellation of the exam, the Town filed
an unfair labor practice charge with the DLR alleging that the union unlawfully
threatened union members with sanctions, including expulsion from the union, if
anymemberstooktheexamination. Thepartiesheldasettlementconference ofthe

This action involves the appeal of a special permit issued by the Zoning Board of
Appeals on July 22, 2008 allowing Ms. Roberta Baskum to operate a kennel upon
property located at 5 Irene Road. Various abutters have appealed this decision to the
Land Court. Since Ms. Baskum is the real party in interest in this case, the Board of
Selectmen and Town Counsel have allowed the permit awardee to defend her
special permit and have not taken an active role in this case to conserve resources.
We will continue to monitor the litigation on behalf of the Town.
This action was brought in the Middlesex Superior Court appealing a traffic
violation issued by the Town for parking in a handicapped parking space without a

In December of 2005, the Zoning Board denied applicant's request for a special
permit or a determination that the proposed use, a concrete batching plant, was a
permitted use in the zoning district. That month, a Special Town Meeting also
approved amendments to the Zoning By -law which changed the zoning designation
of the area to Office Professional, such that the proposed use became prohibited and
couldnotbe authorized even through aspecial permit. Paulini filed two subsequent
lawsuits intheLand Court. The firstlawsuitwas anappeal seeking to overturnthe
ZBA's denial of the special permit and to obtain a declaration from the Court that
theproposed projectdidnotrequire a specialpermit. The second lawsuit was a
challenge tothevalidity ofthebylawamendments. Thelitigationhasbeenstayed
by the Land Court due to an appeal that Paulini filed with the ZBA in 2008 seeking
a special permit for a similar use at the Property.
This case involves an appeal of a determination made by the Building
Commissioner relative to property located at 21 Purchase Street. Nomi Pilzer, the
owner, was notified by the Building Commissioner that the use of the property as a
two -family dwelling was in violation of the Zoning Bylaw and that the use as a two -
family must cease. Pilzer applied for apermitto allowthe second dwelling unit,
which the Building Commissioner denied. Pilzer than appealed to the ZBA, which
voted to uphold the Building Commissioner's decision. Pilzer then appealed to the
Land Court. The Townmoved to add theBuilding Commissioner as adefendant
and bring a counterclaim for enforcement, and plaintiff moved to remand the matter
to the Board of Appeals for further findings. In October, 2008, the parties agreed to
a settlement whereby the plaintiff would cease use of the property as a two -family
and revert the property to a single family use. In return for this agreement by the
plaintiff, the Town agreed not to pursue any fines or non -criminal penalties for the
violation of the Zoning Bylaw, and allowed the plaintiff a reasonable amount of
time to evict one of the two tenants and convert the house back to a one family. This
case is now closed.
The Superior Officers filed this certification petition in July of 2007 with DLR for
certification as the police superiors' exclusive bargaining representative. The Town
hasnotopposed suchcertification. TheDLR supervisedthe electionofofficers in
early 2008 and the Framingham Police Superiors Officers Association was elected
theexclusive bargaining representative ofthe superior officers. This case isnow
closed.
This lawsuit was filed in 2006 by Public Works Supply, Inc. ( " PWS "), a supplier of
fire hydrants, after the Town awarded a contract for fire hydrants to one of PWS's
competitors. PWS filed acomplaint andmotionforpreliminary injunctionagainst
the Town in Middlesex Superior Court, alleging that the Town's specifications for a
particular hydrant were illegal. The Town opposed PWS' motion, arguing that it
was entitled to standardize on one fire hydrant for reasons of public safety and
efficiency inmaintenance. Afteroralargumentandreviewoftheparties'
memoranda andwritten submissions, theCourt issued adecision infavor ofthe
Town on the grounds that it had legitimate public policy reasons (public safety and
efficiency) to decide which type of fire hydrant it wanted, and in requiring the same
type of fire hydrant throughout town for purposes of uniformity, even if it had the
effect of reducing competition. At the time it filed its Answer to PWS' complaint,
the Town filed a counterclaim for interference with its contractual relationship with
the successful bidder. In 2007, PWS filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaim on
the grounds that it allegedly violated the Anti -SLAPP statute, which the Town
opposed. After review, the Superior Court denied PWS' motion. Both parties
subsequently movedforsummaryjudgment. TheCourtdeniedbothmotions onthe
basis thatthere were issues offactrequiring trial. The case will now proceed to
trial, which the Court has scheduled for July 20, 2009.
The plaintiff filed this case in September of 2007, alleging breach of contract and
seeking payment for work purportedly performed by Revoli in connection with the
Doeskin Pump Station and WaterLine project. Theplaintiffalleges specifically that
the Town failed to make payment in the amount of $48,16286. for loaming and

This action involved an appeal by the plaintiffs, South Middlesex Non -Profit

the decision of the Town of Framingham Zoning Board of Appeals to affirm the
Building Commissioner's decision that SMOC's proposed use of 15 Blandin

This is an action appealing a vote of the Board of Selectmen taken on October 21,
2008to remove certainpublic shade trees located adjacent to 13 Bradford Road. In
Count II of the complaint the plaintiff alleges that the Board of Selectmen violated
the Open Meeting Law, G.L. c. 39, Â§ 23B, and requests that the Court find that the
Board committed suchaviolation and enterjudgment againstthe Town. The Town
has moved to dismiss Count II because only the District Attorney, Attorney General,
or three registered voters may bring an action to enforce the Open Meeting Law, and
Ms. Tarr, the sole plaintiff, therefore lacks standing to bring count IL The Town also
alleges that the Court lacks jurisdiction because the plaintiff's claim was filed 22
days after the date of the vote and is thus untimely under G.L. c. 39, Â§23B. After
filing the motion to dismiss, the Town filed the records of proceedings in this case.

In 1999, the Conservation Commission denied an order of conditions for a wetlands
crossing to access a parcel of land and construct a subdivision of between 40 -45
homes. WinchPond Trustappealed decisionunderbylawto Superior Courtand
obtained a Superceding Order of Conditions from the DEP, which the Town
appealed. In 2004, the Town opposed the Trust's motion to substitute a revised plan
in the DEP proceeding showing certain changes to the wetlands crossing plan shown
to the Conservation Commission in 1999. After hearing oral argument, the
Administrative Law Judge ruled that the Trust must either proceed under the
originalplanorfileanewnotice ofintentwiththeConservation Commission. The
Trust filed a new notice of intent with the Conservation Commission in February of
2005. After several hearings, the new notice of intent was approved by the ConCom
withextensive conditions inAugust of2006. TheConCom's Order ofConditions
was appealed to the DEP and the Middlesex Superior Court by Dr. Biagio Conte,
and the plaintiff and the defendants filed cross -motions for judgment on the
pleadings. TheDEP subsequently deniedtheappellant'srequestforadenial
superceding order of conditions. After briefing and oral argument, the Superior
Court issued a Memorandum and Order denying plaintiff's motion for judgment on
the pleadings, and allowing the cross -motion of the applicant and the Conservation
Commission. The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal of this case on January 2, 2008.
The Appeals Court heard oral arguments on the appeal on January 9, 2009 and took
thematterunder advisement. This appealremains pending.

Budgetary Overview
As in past years, I would like to conclude
this report with a  brief discussion of
budgeting andlegal expenses. In2008this
office continued its positive track record of
procuring new revenue for the General Fund
or helping to avoid the imposition of
additional costs to the Town. The services
provided by the Office of the Town Counsel
have resulted in monetary benefits to the
Town that has resulted in direct revenue, 
mitigation and avoided expenses three to
four times greater than the Town's FY 2008
appropriation of $638,000.
Below is a chart summarizing the revenue,
mitigation and avoided expenses achieved in
FY 2008 and likely to be achieved in FY
2009 by the efforts of the Office of the
Town Counsel, or through the substantial
assistance of this office.

By virtue of a prior year's favorable summary judgment ruling achieved in the
Pelham litigation, the Town was able to cease trash collection at the 550 units at the
Pelham Apartments, which results inavoided expenses estimated atmore than
100,000 per year. By virtue of the Pelham ruling, the Town also was able to cease
trash collection at approximately 1,000 units owned by the Framingham Housing
Authority, thus realizing savings of approximately an additional estimated $200,000
per year. These savings amount to approximately $300,000 peryear on an annual
recurring basis.
At the time the Town received summary judgment in 2003 defeating
Pelham's claim for continued trash collection, the Town also was awarded
summary judgment on its counterclaim to recover the cost of certain trash
collection services delivered to Pelham. After a three day bench trial, the
Superior Court awarded thejudgment forthe Town. Although Pelham
initially appealed the judgment, itwithdrew its appeal pursuant to a
settlement in 2008. As part ofthe settlement Pelhampaid the Town
300,000.
In FY 2008, General Growth Properties, Inc.,the developer of Natick Mall,
made further payments totaling $605,000 of the $1,000065,sum it agreed
to pay to settle the litigation that the Town and Planning Board had initiated
against the developer of the Natick Mall in 2004.
In settlement of the litigation between the Town and Comcast, Comcast
agreed (among other concessions) to provide capital payments to the Town
and/or the Town Access Corporation of sums totaling $175,000 for FY
2007 and $50,000 annually thereafter through 2011, in addition to quarterly
payments due from Comcast in an amount totaling 5% of gross annual
revenues for use by the Town, School Department and Public Access
Corporation to utilize in connection with providing public, educational, and
governmental cable programming.

work period under 29 U. S.C. 207(k),the Town has avoided liability to date
for over $1,000500,in damages, in view of the stringent federal law that
often allows for double damages and attorney's fees to be assessed against
arties found to have violated the Fair Labor Standards Act.

While we certainly cannot promise the
revenue results of the nature and extent
achieved to date on an ongoing basis in the
future, we will continue to exercise
creativity, diligence, and apply the highest
legal skills to address the litigation that does
arise as we advocate on behalf of the best
interests of the Board of Selectmen and the
taxpayers of the Town of Framingham. 
Conclusion
In closing, we wish to thank the Board of
Selectmen and the residents of the Town for
the opportunity to serve as your Town

Department of Veterans' Services. Sandra
Charton is the Director of the Division of
Human Resources.
Human Resources
The Department of Human Resources has
multipleresponsibilities. We oversee the
recruitment and hiring process for all Town
positions and conduct orientations for new
Town and School employees. In addition, we
maintain and update the Town's classification
and pay plan; draft, revise and interpret the
Town's personnel policies and procedures;
play a  key role in  negotiating and
implementing all  collective bargaining
agreements; foster harmonious and
productive labor and employee relations;
perform cost and staff analyses; assist in
General Government 
employee development and training; and
oversee employee recognition programs.
Moreover, our Department oversees the
Town's payroll and benefits, as well as its
Workers' Compensation, Family and Medical
Leave Act, and unemployment insurance
programs.
Judith Caron is  our Human Resource
Generalist /Analyst. She manages 
the
employment and recruitment process,
including advertising, reviewing employment
applications, interviewing candidates,
checking references, and facilitating
background checks and pre -employment
testing where applicable. She also is
responsible for processing payment of
department bills and assists with providing
coverage with customer service. Finally, sheoversees compliance with the Family and

Administrator, maintains and processes the
Town's weekly payroll and attendance
records. Cindy McKellick is the Benefits
Administrator for the department. She
administers health, dental and life insurance
programs for the Town, the Schools, and our
retirees. 
Worker' s 
Claudia Araujo manages
Compensation program 
our
for
employees of the Town and School
department. Shealsomanages theDirectPay
Program, performs benefit audits, provides
ongoing assistance in the area of benefit
administration, and processes payroll on an as
needed basis. Brant Johnson, the newest
addition to the department, is  our
Administrative Assistant. He provides
administrative support to the Director and the
department. He manages monthly
departmental vendor meetings and HR
sponsored events such as our Employee
Recognition and Health and Wellness Fair.
He is also the editor of the Town's Employee
Newsletter.
We had another extremely active year in
HumanResources. We successfully filled
several key positions such as Director of
Veterans' Services, Treasurer, Assessor,
Director of Community and Economic
Development, Fire Chief and Director ofthe
Health Department at  the
division /department head level. In the area
of labor relations, we negotiated successor
contracts with the Town's nine unions in an
effective and productive manner. In addition,
we collaborated with the Town's Public
Employee Committee to effectuate changes in
our health insurance plans that will help the
Town'sfiscalsituation. Our department has
also played an integral role in implementing
GL Chapter 32B, Section 18, which was
recentlyacceptedby Town Meeting. This
statute, which will shift the cost of health
insurance for Town retirees from
Framingham to the federal government, will
takeeffect on July 1, 2009. Inaneffort to
educate eligible applicants, we sent out
mailings, held approximately six meetings, and
General Government 
2008 Annual Report
called every retiree who had not responded to
our initial communications.
In the area of compensation and benefits, we
launched a classification and compensation
study to compare Framingham with similar
communities. That study will continue
throughout 2009. We have also instituted free
seminars to introduce our employees to
existing and expanded "voluntary" benefits
provided by the Town, such as long term care
insurance, Flexible Spending Accounts, and
supplemental lifeinsurance. TheTown does
not pay any funds for these benefits, but
offers employees a  group rate and other
advantages.
We have also continued our activities in the
field ofemployee relations. We organized and
ran an Employee Recognition dinner ( not
paid out of Town funds) and held a highly
successful food drive for a local pantry at the
same time. We planned, staffed and ran a
Health, Benefits &  Wellness Fair, where
Town and School employees were able to
learn more about a variety of vendors and
Framingham businesses. HumanResources
was also responsible for publishing the first
issue ofan Employee Newsletter. In addition,
we held free in- service trainings for our
employees on topics such as financial
planning and diversity issues.
Finally, we tried to exemplify the "human" in
Human Resources." With Brant leading the
way, we organized a successful blood drive for
a family member of a Town employee, as well
as coordinating other blood drives to benefit
local hospitals.
We anticipate that this year will be extremely
challenging, but we are determined to
continue serving our " customers" -  the
Town's employees, retirees, and citizens â€” in a
courteous and professional manner.

The Department of Veterans' Services was
established pursuant to Chapter 115 of the
Massachusetts General Laws. The mission of
the Department is to aid, assist, advise and
advocate for veterans and their dependents
regarding their right to benefits and services
under both local, state and federal laws.
Services offered by the Department include
emergency financial assistance; help with
obtaining food, clothing, shelter, assistance in
filling out claim forms for benefits, and
coordinating other social services and
resources that might be available to aid
veterans and their dependents. The
Department keeps up to date on new policies,
legislation and programs available to the
veteran community.
Veterans activities this year included Memorial
Day Ceremonies, during which the Town's
Historian, Fred Wallace, spoke about Union
Brigadier General Gorge Gordon, Civil War
Medal of Honor Recipient Conrad Homan
and Korean War Veteran Orrie Tucker.
Veterans benefit briefings were conducted in
July at a Cookout in Cushing Park and at the
Veterans luncheon at the Callaghan Senior
Center. On Veterans Day, the Veterans
Council sponsored a traditional wreath laying
ceremony in Victory Park and in Memorial 
2008 Annual Report

Cushing Memorial Monument followed by a
lecture from Pearl Harbor Survivor Jerry
Holderman in the Cushing Chapel.
In addition to these activities, the Director
participated in a Trench Art exhibit at the
Callaghan Center and conducted other benefit
briefings for Framingham residents.
Framingham' s veterans have embarked on
establishing a Universal Post #1. This is a new
service oriented veteran's post whose
objective is  to re- energize veterans to
participate in  community service and
comradeship.
In addition, we appreciate the encouragement,
energy, and enthusiasm personified by Larry
Herson, the President of the Framingham
Veterans' Council. Larry and his fellow
council members have helped us in so many
ways to make the veterans in Framingham
aware of their unique place in the town. Larry
and volunteers placed over 4,100 National

veterans.
Veteran' s Benefits and Services look forward
to continuing the tradition of "Excellence in

the number of users from 2007 due to the
Munis system being expanded to more Town,
School, and Public Safety users. The system
was updated to version 2005, which included
a  new web based system administration
interface. New features to the budget and
billing module allowed the Town to better
distribute next year budget entry, which
enabled more departments to enter their next
year's budget in a centralized system. We
collaborated with Munis in the design,
implementation and beta version of a new
documentation tool for providing user and
configuration setup documents. We continue
to work with other cities and towns to take
advantage of all the new features that Munis
offers.

Town of Framingham  2008 Annual Report
al
Building Services is a department of the
GeneralGovernmentDivision. Ourmain
mission is the care and maintenance of Town
buildings under the jurisdiction of the Board
of Selectmen.
A reduction in force has mandated the
department to prioritize our work and we
continue to make strides in using volunteer
and subsidized help from non Town agencies
in these times of budget cuts. In addition to
our core duties, we have been involved with
many routine repair projects and preventative
programs this past year.
We have participated and served on the
building committee for the Callahan Senior
Center. This was a rewarding project and the
town's seniors can enjoy this beautiful facility
for many years. Building Services continues to
address ADA deficiencies in the Memorial
Building. Wehavecompletedmandated
secondary railings on the stairwells in the
building through the use of CDBG grants and
will soon be installing a new chair lift to
replace the over 30 year non compliant
existing lift and the expansion of TTY
systems throughout the building.
Our Capital projects this past year have been
rewarding as we have completed the new
boiler room in the Memorial Building. These
high efficiency boilers will save the town
many thousands dollars in energy funds over
the coming years. The Nevins Hall stage
renovation has been completed with new
curtains and lighting and is  slowly
transforming Nevins Hall back to its original
condition. 
All Town operated parking functions are
under the jurisdiction of Building Services.
We have replaced sixty meters in the
downtown area with digital mechanisms; this
will result in additional revenues and fewer
breakdowns.
The Waverly Commuter Lot has enjoyed a
sold out status for the past six months. The
Pearl Street Garage and the Hollis Court Daily
Lot continues to struggle as our economy
falters.
Our summer concert program is under review
and some future adjustments may be made
because of the RIF process.
As always, in past years it must be noted that
Building Services relies on the professionalism
and capabilities ofmanyothers. Iwould like
to extend my grateful appreciation to the
Public Works department, Parks & Recreation
department, Finance Division, the Town
Clerk's office, the Administration, Police and
Fire Divisons for their assistance throughout
the year.
Staffing issues have made this year particularly
difficult. I sincerely would like to acknowledge
my staff that continues to attend to many
requested tasks with courteous attention.
Building Services is looking forward to the
coming year with the challenges the Town
faces and the commitment to the Town
philosophy " Dedicated to Excellence in
Public Service."

Chief Financial Officer
Memorial Building, RmR _ 127 1  508 -532 -5425 1  office.cfo@fraia.gov
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer has
both financialand policyduties. Itis staffed
by the Chief Financial Officer and an
Assistant ChiefFinancial Officer. The Office
oversees
activities 
Town
with the 
financial
assistance 
management
of the three
departments that have direct responsibility for
financial management of Town government:
assessing, accounting, auditing, collecting
taxes and local receipts, cash management and
investing. The Assessing Department is
responsible for the administration of the
property tax system including the valuation of
real and personal property and the assessment
of taxes against these parcels and accounts.
The Office of the Treasurer/ Collector is
responsible for the collection of all town
revenues, the investment of all revenues, and
the management oftheTown'sdebt. The
Accounting Department maintains the
Town's accounting records, generates
financial management information for use by
all Town departments in the management of
their operations, directs all audit activity and
reviews compliance with internal controls.
The Office of the Chief Financial Officer is
directly responsible for the development of
the annual operating and capital budgets. To
accomplish this, the Office works closely with
the Town officials and committees. Upon
adoption of the annual operating and capital
budgets, the Office of the Chief Financial
Officer monitors the progress of revenue and
spending throughout the year to eliminate
budgetary problems that adversely affect the
fiscal condition of the Town.
Other responsibilities of the Chief Financial
Officer include participation in management
of  workers' compensation claims; 
management of the health insurance plan and
membership on the Retirement Board.
Maintaining the financial health of the Town
was 
the primary mover of actions and
initiatives in 2008. FY08 closed with a snow
and ice deficit of more than $1.3 million. The
creative tax title agreement for brownfield
properties provided much of the funding to
resolve it. The balancing of the FY09
operating and capital budgets for the General
Fund required a conservative approach since
revenues were anticipated to grow by only
4.8 %. The passage of Section 18 Medicare
coverage for retirees, and the negotiated
increase in employee premium contributions
have helped reduce the increase in the cost of
healthcare. Increasingrevenue byauctioning
tax tide property and aggressive pursuit of tax
delinquents through small claims court were
also accomplished. The third and fourth
quarters of 2008 saw a freefall of state and
then local revenue requiring the CFOs office
to recommend the reduction of budgets,
staffing and service provision in  all
departments and programs in order to balance
the budget. In the middle of 2008, we saw the
retirement of our outstanding Treasurer,
Dennis O'Neill, and the departure of our long
time ChiefAssessor Mike Flynn. We will miss
themboth. The Town was able to attract
excellent replacements: Stephen Price as
Treasurer/ Collector and Daniel Dargon as
Chief Assessor.
The CFO would like to thank The Assistant
CFO, Jennifer Pratt, Stephen Price and his
staff in the Office of the Treasurer/ Collector;
Dan Dargon and his staff in the Assessing
Office and Richard G. Howarth, Jr. and his
staff in the Accounting Department. Without

Town of Framingham 
Collector 
2008 Annual Report
Fiscal Year 2008 was a good year in this busy
office. The staff remained constant with no
turnover. The total number of employees
remained unchanged at 9.
As always I am indebted to them for the first
class job they do on my behalf as well as the
Town's.
Our operating system on Munis continues to
be updated on a regular basis but we have
become very comfortable with it. We have
continued to enjoy excellent in house support
from Scott Jung in the TS Department with
Munis and are indebted to him. Because of
the time sensitive nature of most of our
operation from sending bills to posting
payments disruptions can be disastrous.
Collection amounts and percentages were as
follows. Real Estate taxes collected were
130,858.808,52 (97.45 %)  and Personal
Property taxes were $6,277.915,48 (98.20 %).
Excise Taxes collected were $5,073.287,98
72.63 %).Excise tax is collected on a calendar
year basis which reflects the lower collection
percentage.Tax Title collections were
1,325.148,07 including interest and penalties.
We have continued to work hard on
delinquent taxes in every area and recently
entered into a  contract for third party
collection of out of town water bills and out
of state parking tickets.
Earnings on investments for the year of
740,20869. were ,  below budget. We
continue to monitor the bank rates to
maximize our earnings. 
The Town continued to hold the Aa3 bond
rating only with a negative outlook in FY
2008 from Moody's. The future will hold a
challenge to maintain it but the goal is to work
to that end. We need to improve our fund
balances to help offset those areas that we
have little control over such as per capita
income levels.
We issued two Bond Anticipation Note in
2008, one in the amount of $2,172,111,
awarded to UBS Securities at a rate of 3.85%
and the other in the amount of $7,657658,to
Banc of America at a rate of 2.50% and
borrowed $ 9,000246, in general obligation
bonds for multiple projects. The lowest net
rate was 4.13% by UBS securities among the
several bidders. These were very competitive
rates in the face of stable Fed Fund rates.
This department has worked diligently to
meet the requirements of the laws, the
challenges of the technology advances and the
Town's customer service policy. We try to
treat customers with respect while taking their
payments, answering their questions regarding
process and solving their problems as quickly
and efficiently as possible.
As per Town By -Law I  am reporting the
following information regarding authorized
debt schedules. The first schedule shows what
is authorized and unissued as of June 30,
2008. The second schedule shows the debt
issued and out standing during Fiscal Year
2008.

The Board of Assessors' annual report for
calendar year 2008 with statistics for Fiscal
Year 2008 is as follows:
Because of the values established in Fiscal
Year 2008, we received 232 abatement
applications. These applications represented
1.19% of the total tax bills issued for Fiscal
Year 2008.
In Fiscal Year 2008 the residential class
contributed $35.7 million dollars in new value.
Finance 
This growth was attributed to new homes
completed in 2008 as well as other
improvements made to the residential
inventory during 2008. Commercial &
Industrial growth added $ 14.0 million in
commercial and industrial new growth value
along with $46.3 million in personal property
new growth value.
Values were lowered for Fiscal Year 2009 due
to declining values indicated by sales and

2008 Annual Report
A Message from Chief Carl
The Framingham Police Department is
charged with protecting and serving those
who live, work, and travel in Framingham.
The Department accomplishes its mission by
establishing partnerships with the community,
using innovative problem -solving approaches,
and recognizing the value of strong leadership
and organizationalaccountability. In an
environment of challenging fiscal constraint,
the Department continues to aggressively seek
revenues through grant funding and outside
sources to assist in accomplishing its mission.
Also, like other Town Departments, the
Police Department maintains fiscal
responsibility, by reducing expenditures
wherever possible.
One of the core tools used to identify areas
upon which to focus our resources is
intelligence driven deployment, by analyzing
crime and call data we are able to deploy
officers into the community with purpose and
direction. This strategy makes the most of our
resources.
As the Department continues to address
significant challenges reflective of large urban
communities; our greatest resource continues
to be our personnel. To capitalize on this we
recruit and hire only the best individuals to be
Framingham police officers, presently
approximately 74% of all persons attempting
to become Framingham Officers are
disqualified from the process, only the best
and the brightest earn the opportunity to wear
a Framingham Police badge.
In addition to our primary mission of crime
reduction, the Department continues to
proactively address current and emerging
Public Safety & Health 
issues in  law enforcement, such as
immigration and community outreach. The
Department continues to  develop a
productive relationship with Framingham' s
large immigrant community in an effort to
educate them on how to report crime and
prevent becoming victims. We also continue
to receive grant funding to enhance our
partnerships with other important segments
of the community, such as youths and the
homeless. The aggressive pursuit of grant
funding has continued to allow us to provide
every police officer with new body armor, at
absolutely no cost to the Town.
As we move forward in a post -9/11 era, the
Police Department will continue to work
closely with our state and federal public safety
partners to address critical issues such as
domestic terrorism, homeland security, gang
activity, and emergency preparedness.
Through these partnerships, the Department
is able to access and leverage otherwise
unavailable resources to accomplish our
mission.
As Chief of Police, I  am thankful for the
support given to the Police Department from
the Board of Selectmen, Town Manager,
Town Meeting, and especially from our town
residents.
Retirements
This year we had several retirements of
officers from service.
Officer William Fuer served since 1974. He
was a  reliable and well respected police
officer. In January of 2005 he and Officer
Degnan were brutally stabbed making the
arrest of a violent suspect. Both received high 
47

praise and recognition for their acts of
bravery, receiving the George L. Hanna
Awardfortheiractions. Officer Fuer
epitomized dedication, sacrifice and true
professionalism throughout his career. We
will miss him.
The following patrol officers have also retired
this year;
Officer James Finks served since 1974.
Officer Douglas Bevilacqua served since 1976.
Officer Joseph Besardi served since 1982.
Officer Angela Aurelio retired due to a job
related injury.
New Police Employees

department. Officers' Brian Blue, Rony Cesar,
Jose Goncalves, Wayne Jordan, Rachel
Mickens, Chris Pisano, underwent rigorous
training at the Lowell Police Academy. Also
hired were Chris Ottaviani and John
Haidousis, a transfer from Fitchburg Police
Department.
There are presently 3 Portuguese speaking
Police recruits attending the Boston Police
Academy.
Promotions
This year we saw the promotions of three
hard working officers. Those officers are now;
Lieutenants Victor Pereira, Harry Wareham,
Sergeants Lester Baker, and Martin Keith.

Revenue
The fiscal responsibilities of day -to -day
operations of the department fall under the
direction of the Administrative Aide to the
chief, Officer Michael Donnelly, and his
assistant, Mary McGonagle.
The Police Department generates monies for
the Town of Framingham through the
issuance of licenses, permits, administration
fees, and fines associated with parking tickets
and traffic citations. Money is also received
from the Framingham District Court for fines
associated with penalties imposed upon those
convicted of various crimes. This revenue is
not entered into the Police Department
budget, but is  deposited into the Town
General Fund. Fiscal year 2008 revenues are

Crime Statistics
The department is committed to using its
resources efficiently and effectively. The use
of crime and statistical analysis enables us to
identify emerging crime trends, track incident
locations and identify and implement
preventative, educational, intervention, or
enforcement strategies.
Due to a Federal reporting mandate in 2007,
Domestic Assaults were re -coded and are now
classified from Part 2 offenses to Part 1
offenses under the Assault category. This
effected change in both Part 1 and 2 offenses
in previous years as well.

Fire Prevention Division
The Division of Fire Prevention is comprised
of one Fire Marshal, Assistant Fire Marshal
and two Inspectors that have the following
responsibilities:
The Fire Marshal is responsible for the day -
to -day operation of the fire prevention office.
He is also responsible for conducting fire
investigations and coordinating activities
between the Framingham Police Department
andtheStateFireMarshal' soffice. Other
responsibilities of the Marshal include giving
safety talks for Framingham's schools, citizens
groups, group residences, and setting up tours
ofthefirestations. TheMarshal alsomeets
on a  regular basis with other town
departments to assist in the planning of the
town's future.
The Assistant Fire Marshal is responsible for
reviewing the construction plans that are
submitted to the Fire Department. He also
meets with contractors regarding fire alarm
and sprinkler systems, as well as conducting
meetings with contractors, engineers and
property owners for up- coming projects and
Public Safety & Health 
2008 Annual Report
any problems that arise during construction.
He coordinates with other Town
Departments on important issues such as
overcrowding, boarding and lodging house
issues.
The Inspectors are responsible for issuing
permits and conduct the inspections required
by state andlocalcodes. They also inspect
and test all new homes, new and remodeled
commercial buildings as well as renovation
projects. The Inspectors investigate andwork
in conjunction with other town departments
to handle complaints by citizens and town
departments to assure the safety of
Framingham's residents, their guests, and the
ever -increasing Framingham business
community.
The goal of the Framingham Fire Department
is to establish a fire and safety education
program that will be delivered to preschool,
day care, grades K -6, Boy and Girl Scout
troops as well as church and community
groups. By visiting these groups on an annual
basis, the safety message that they receive will
become part of their lives and each child as
they grow will always be aware of fire safety.
They will also be bringing this message home
to their families, which ultimately, would
prevent fire related accidents in their lives and
the lives of their family and friends.

operations, emergency vehicle operations,
self -contained breathing apparatus
proficiency, technical rescue operations, pump
operations, and ladder operations are some of
theannual training programs conducted. In
addition, major department -wide training
programs focused on critical areas of fire
service operations and overall firefighter
safety. Professional firefighters know that the
job is training intensive -  the safety of the
public and that of the firefighters depends on
it.
To help address firefighter safety a
comprehensive Rapid Intervention Team
RIT) training program was developed for the
Department. National consensus standards
endorse standardized RIT training and RIT
operations to reduce firefighter death and
injuries.
Unfortunately, much of the content of the
RIT training program is based on " lessons
learned" from the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH)
firefighter fatality reports. Those reports
often find a  deviation from standard
procedure or a lack of basic training as a cause
of the fatality. The Framingham Fire
Department RIT training program focuses on
basic fire ground skills and knowledge. All
members of the Department completed
individual skill proficiency training modules
and company evolutions. To ensure
consistency, standard operating guidelines for
RIT operations and emergency procedures

Temple Street Fire
where implemented. New equipment, such as
the recently acquired "state of the art" self
contained breathing apparatus also plays an
integral role in firefighter safety.
In summary, the ultimate goal of any training
division is to support effective operations in a
safe and efficient manner. Proficient basics,
sound strategies and tactics, and a proactive
and progressive philosophy are the guiding
principles in developing all training programs
within the Framingham Fire Department.
Fire Alarm
The Fire Alarm Division is responsible for the
general maintenance of traffic signals,
controls, the municipal fire alarm system,
master boxes, street boxes and underground
and aerial cable.
Fourteen new master boxes were added in
2008. We now have a total of 900 boxes in
service in strategic locations throughout
Framingham. Of the 900 boxes, 538 are
master boxes that protect individual
properties, and 362 are street boxes.
In addition to the regular duties of
maintaining and installing the fire alarm and
communication system, the Fire Alarm
Division was also responsible for maintaining
and repairing forty -two (42) traffic signals, six
6) 4 -way flashing signals, twenty -eight (28)
school zone signals and two (2) 30mph `S'
curve signals. The following isabreakdown

boxes and replacement of deteriorated cable
doubling the amount installed in 2007.
32 pole transfers for Verizon were completed,
this was and increase of 8 poles.

Emergency Medical Services
American Medical Response (AMR) continues

Currently AMR is contracted to provide two 
2008 Annual Report
Advanced Life Support (ALS) Paramedic level
ambulances. Framingham has experienced a
steady rise in medical calls as we responded to
5,779 calls for medical assistance in 2008.
Increased demands on Emergency Medical
Services have forced the administration to
reevaluate our EMS operations. During this
restructuring we have negotiated a third AMR
non -dedicated ambulance which is stationed
within our borders and have also initiated new

2008 Annual Report
For 2008 the Inspectors, Administrators and
Code Enforcement Inspectors within the
Building Department have had a very active
year providing quality customer service and
effective solutions toward resolving citizen
concerns.
The focus of the Department continues to be
the pursuit of the highest quality of public
service by responding to concerns as they
arise, to follow up on previous concerns,
maintain a  record of property activities
reviewed by inspectors and investigators and
be responsive to consumer protection.
The Department continues to maintain a
recognized professional presence for its staff
for other communities. As we work toward
hiring the best and most qualified people to
deliver the services expected other
communities see these qualities and extend
opportunities to staff members to deliver
similar services for their citizens.
In 2008 Paul Landers the Senior Field
Inspector accepted a  position with the
Framingham Housing Authority. Paul is very
knowledgeable individual with excellent
people skills and a great sense of awareness of
the community. He shared his professional
construction knowledge and experiences with
those he interacted with in the field to assist
them with their construction projects. He
responded to all request for emergency
assistance in a timely professional manner
without delay and provided guidance to the
property owners, tenants and others who may
have suffered loss do fire or other un- natural
or natural causes. 
All of us 
here were
disappointed to see him leave and extremely
proud of the opportunity extended to him to
provide assistance and continue to improve
the quality of life for others in the community.
With 2 positions being vacant and the number
of projects ongoing through out town, Mike
Public Safety & Health 
Tusino, Steve Barss, Mark Hughes and the
Commissioner stepped up to meet the request
for these services in addition to their every
day duties until the positions can be refilled.
One Field Inspector Position was offered and
accepted by James Paolini, Jim lives and has
worked in  the constructions field in
Framingham and the Metro West area for
many years. He is  a 
certified building
inspector, possesses excellent knowledge and
personal experience of construction practice
and method. His educational background in
Economics and Consumer Affairs has well
prepared him with the customer service skills
required when interacting with the public.
The building department in conjunction with
the Town Manager, Board of Selectmen and
many other town officials worked to develop
action planning at the beginning of the year
2008) that is proactive and preventive to
assist in dealing with the housing economic
crisis occurring within the town and across
the nation.
The action plan resulted in the creation of a
data base to monitor over 200 foreclosed
properties. The purpose of the plan was to
identify foreclosed properties and reduce the
impacts these properties could have on public
safety and neighboring properties.
The data base contains critical information for
ownership, conditions of the property, status,
and use. Properties as noted as being un-
occupied are forwarded to both the
Framingham Police and Fire Department who
monitored and reported conditions of change.
The data base identified 123 single family
homes, 93 condominiums, 35 2 families and
10 3 families.
Code Enforcement Activities which includes
the enforcement of the Nuisance, Sign,
Zoning, General By -Laws and other Life 
61
Page 90
Town of Framingham
Safety Codes Regulations and Standard for
2008 was also very active.
The Code Enforcement Housing activity
reports illustrates that the inspectors
investigated over 600 cases of alleged housing
issues including 80 cases for basement
apartments,173 cases of rooming houses and
160 cases of illegal apartments.
The Nuisance Officer has investigated and
pursued over 500 cases involving Trash &
Debris, Commercial Vehicles, Unregistered
Vehicles and Vehicles Parking within the
front Setback.
The Sign Officer continues to make progress
with property owners and businesses toward
compliance with the Towns' Sign By -Law.
Over 70 signs have been removed and or
brought into compliance, over 500 notices
have sent to owners /businesses advising them
of the non -compliance their signs are with the
Sign By -Law with suggested relief needed to
maintain them. The cataloging of the signs on
each building and property through out the
town is continuing, which provides imaging
and permit history. 
2008 Annual Report
The economic crisis and inflationary effects
on commodities and goods provided high
demand for consumer protection. Jack Walsh
the Town's Sealer and the Assistant Sealer Ed
Gentile provided preventive and reactive
response service to monitor and address
consumers concerns. They investigated
multiple cases involving retail gas pricing, fuel
oil delivery services and retail price frauds.
The building permit activity for 2008 indicates
that over 2300 permits were issued for this
period an increase of 400 plus building
permits over 2007. New home starts building
permits were the lowest number than any
other year in comparison to the past five
years. The total receipts for 2008 were up by
40,000 in comparison to the previous year.
In conclusion I  extend my deepest
appreciation to the team I have the pleasure
of working with daily, their individual and
combine efforts to provide quality service to
the people and businesses within the
community is tireless.

The Department during 2008 saved
consumers and businesses in Framingham
well into the hundreds of thousands of dollars
by conducting both mandated and spot
inspections. This is in addition to the fees
and fines collected forthe town. Errors were
found and corrected which resulted in
sufficient savings to consumers. The
Department checked 4,300 items in local retail
stores to ensure that they scanned correctly.
This was an increase of 11% over the
previous year of items inspected. The
Department found that 96.21 % were priced
correctly, 2.44 % were under priced, and 1.35
were over priced. 
2008 Annual Report

The Department of Public Works had yet
another extremely busy year that tested our
administrative and operational resources to
the extreme. As the overall condition of the
infrastructure continues to decline at an
accelerated pace, the Department worked
diligently across the various disciplines to
respond to customer service initiatives and to
make repairs as quickly as possible. The water
and sewer infrastructure continues to
experience failures of its components at an
alarming rate. In 2008, the Water Division
responded to 380 system failures that included
broken hydrants, leaking water services,
broken water mains, frozen distribution
valves, and replaced other components of the
system that were associated with the Pumping
Station and storage tanks systems. The
Highway Division continues to be innovative
in its approach to preserving the surface
condition of roadways by using new pavement
mixes and surface treatments that will serve to
extend the life of roadways until more a
substantive reconstruction program can be
funded by the Town. These surface
treatments are applied after the Department
workforce has reshaped the road and repaired
the utility structures and signage.
The Department began in 2008 to take a lead
role in the development of plans to improve
the grade crossings of the CSX rail lines along
Routes 126 and 135. A significant effort has
been undertaken to advance the planning
studies and to develop the conceptual designs
of the various rail crossing alternatives.
Administratively, the Department also
devoted a significant amount of resources to
the acquisition of a $310,000 Massachusetts
Opportunity Relocation Expansion (MORE) 
Grant and a 12.9 million dollar Massachusetts
Life Science Center Grant for the upgrade of
the water and wastewater systems that serve
the Technology Park. These improvements
to the infrastructure enable the transition of
the Tech Park from a mostly industrial to
offices and laboratories supporting the Life
Sciences. All Divisions in the Department
participated in the investigation, analysis and
application effort.

technical expertise to the operational divisions
of the Public Works Department, other Town
Departments, and various Boards and
Commissions, maintains an extensive
Geographical Information System (GIS) and
is the custodian of a  large collection of
irreplaceable paper plans and documents.

protect the Town's water and streams from
pollution and to comply with the USEPA
regulations relative thereto.
Significant progress was made in a variety of
critical areas during FY08 including the
completion of two projects outlined in the
MADEP Administrative Consent Order
ACO): the completion of the Fenwick
Wastewater Pump Station and construction of
the Water Street and Saxonville Sewer line.
The ACO requires the Town to undertake
major sewer construction and rehabilitation
projects over several years with the primary
focus of alleviating reoccurring sanitary sewer
overflows, a violation of State and Federal
law. Failure to comply with the conditions of
the ACO can result in administrative civil or
criminal action. Continued improvements to
the infrastructure and maintenance
management of the Wastewater System and
has resulted in significant reductions in Sewer
System Overflows (SSO's).
Water system improvements were achieved
with the installation of a  new water
distribution system in the Cove Avenue, Fay
Road and Waverly Street neighborhoods.
DPW Water Department staff completed the
installation of a  new water main in the
Brigham Road area at a sizeable cost savings
as 
compared to contractor services. The
Department will continue to identify projects
that can be performed with DPW staff and
equipment.
The Department completed the evaluation of
the Saxonville Levee Flood Control Station
and System as required by FEMA and the
Army Corps of Engineers and thereby
preserved the avoidance of the Federal Flood
Insurance requirements for the inhabitants of
the area. The Levee and dam system were
determined to be in good condition and
required only modest improvements to the
flood control devices which are underway.
Phase One of a  three phase project to
reconstruct the State Street area was
Public Works 
2008 Annual Report
completed through the collective efforts of
Engineering, Highway, Water and Wastewater
Department staff. New street lighting,
roadway improvements, curbing, sidewalks
and ADA compliant crosswalks were
installed. In addition, the water and
wastewater utilities were replaced strategically
addressing infrastructure needs in a holistic
fashion.
Reconstruction of Franklin Street began in
FY08 with approximately 35% of the work
completed. This is  a  state funded
Transportation Improvement Project ( TIP).
The department is working on the design of
Concord Street from Lincoln Street to Route
9 which is the priority of the State TIP list.
Improvements to traffic signals, pedestrian
signals and sidewalks were achieved at Beacon
Street at Route 30, Potter at Elm Streets, High
Street at Main and Pleasant Street at Edgell
Road. These improvements included the
modifications necessary to achieve ADA
compliant sidewalks.
The Department replaced the master traffic
signal controller in the Route 135/126
intersection, coordinating the signals with
Howard Street. The intersection was repaved,
new signal heads were mounted and
corresponding pavement markings were
installed. Traffic queues have improved as a
result of these upgrades.
The Department continued to work on the
design of multiple projects scheduled in the
MADEP ACO in order to better coordinate
the projects and keep them on the tight
schedule mandated in  the ACO. The
Department successfully sought two time
extensions on projects with schedules that
lagged due to bidding and /or construction
delays
The Birch Road Well Reactivation Project
continues to progress. The design of the
project reached 30% during FY08 and the

The Highway Division is responsible for the
maintenance and repair of the Town's
roadway and sidewalk infrastructure including;
pavement markings, granite and bituminous
curbing, street and regulatory signage,
stormwater utilities, traffic islands, and street
trees.
Stormwater Management
The Stormwater Management System consists
of more than 200 miles of surface and
subsurface drainage systems, 12,200 catch
basin and manhole structures, and more than
600 drainage outfalls.
In order to maintain compliance with the
EPA Storm Water Phase II Permit, the
Highway Division made a vigorous yearlong
effort to visit and clean as many of the
drainage structures as possible and, with use
of contract services, removed silt, sand, and
debris from approximately 8,600 catch basins.
The storm drain cleaning program 
has
continued to produce a significant repair list
as the inspection process proceeds. The
Beaver Dam Brook continues to be a
significant operational challenge for the
Division as even modest rain events may
cause the brook to surcharge at the many
culvert headwalls in South Framingham. The
deficiencies in  the stormwater systems
throughout the Town are a major cause of
unscheduled overtime in the Department.
In order to minimize the intrusion of sand
from entering, and further diminishing the
capacity of the system, the Division has
implemented strict control practices for the
use of deicing materials during the winter
months. In addition, a  rapid and
comprehensive post- winter street cleaning
program is performed annually to remove as
Public Works 
2008 Annual Report
much sand from the streets and thereby
minimize the opportunity for accumulation in
the system.
The Division also performed the routine
overnight sweeping of the streets and
sidewalks of the commercial areas to
minimize the entry of materials into the
drainage system and to provide a cleaner
environment in the downtown area. The
removal of sand and debris from the Town's
catch basins and manholes remains an
operational priority each year.
Pavement Management
The 2008 construction projects included the
replacement or upgrade of roadway elements
and appurtenances so that both regulatory
guidelines, and directives, were adhered to and
visual enhancements could be made. New
pavement markings, street signs, sidewalks,
granite and bituminous curbing, wheelchair
ramps and curb -cut control measures were
addressed during the construction. The
projects addressed more then six miles of
public ways.
Winter Storm Management
The Highway Division is responsible for the
provision of a safe automotive and pedestrian
environment both during and after winter
storm events. This effort involves the plowing
and treating of 550 lane miles of public
roadway, 22 municipal parking facilities, and
115 miles of sidewalks and public pathways.
The Division has integrated the Town's
Geographical Information System (GIS) with
an Incident Command Structure to manage
each event. The purpose of this strategic
effort is  to provide a 
high level of
accountability while applying the minimum
amount of resources to each storm event.
Tree Warden & Forestry Management
The Highway Division is responsible for the
maintenance management of the Town's
estimated 12,000 public street trees and for
the development of a Public Shade Tree
program for the community. The purpose of 
72
Page 101
Town of Framingham
this program is to promote, preserve, and
enhance the shade tree environment of the
community through the application of best
management practices and public education
campaigns.
The Department planted 45 trees in 2008 at
the Town Common and Town Centre.
Additionally, the islands in the adjacent areas
were landscaped.
The Highway Division oversees the Town's
roadside vegetation management program
that is  permitted annually by the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection. This program allows the
Department to apply best management
practices for the control of curbside
vegetation that otherwise would grow
uncontrollably and require the commitment of
substantial and sustained labor to control
growth. A primary and recurring function of
this operating group 
is  the statutory
requirement to maintain the 14' - 6" height
clearance over the 550 lane mile roadway
network. The Town's shade trees, while
providing a great public amenity to the Town,
require routine maintenance management so
that they do not also become a public liability.
The Tree warden conducts frequent
hazardous tree assessments, prescribes
treatment, oversees removals, and participates
in public hearings on issues related to trees
within scenic ways. The Department routinely
responded to citizen inquiries and requests for
service, and Forestry Section personnel
removed several dead or diseased street trees
in 2008. The tree crews performed tree
pruning and up- limbing for road and sidewalk
clearance on several streets included in the
2008 Annual Road Resurfacing Plan.
The Department and specialized temporary
staff continued a town wide tree survey to
identify tree hazards and diseases so that we
may provide and promote tree health and
support and an overall accounting of street
trees, which may benefit the Town of

Traffic Systems Management
The Traffic Systems section of the Highway
Division manages the maintenance,
fabrication, and placement of the Town's
regulatory and street signage, steel beam safety
guardrail, installation of new and annual
refreshing of pavement markings, and the
work zone safety program 
for Division
operations. This section is responsible for the
advance planning of the traffic management
coordination for the roadway construction
program, as well as, for the implementation of
the street by street " no parking" posting
required to efficiently advance the street
sweeping program. The pre -planning for the
traffic management coordination during the
construction season maximizes the efficient
production of the work, and also secures a
safe environment for the motorists and the
work crews alike.
The Traffic Systems section managed the
contract and divisional painting of 86 miles of
yellow centerline, 92 miles of white edge line,
and over 600 crosswalks throughout the
Town.
In addition, the Division installed and or
replaced hundreds of regulatory signs and
advisory signs either by direction of the Board
of Selectmen or as required through routine
maintenance practices.
Solid Waste Management Program
100 \ Western AvellLle (  508 -532 -6001
nitl((zfraTllingh <L1TliTl1. g0v
The Solid Waste Management Program is
responsible for the management and oversight
of the Town's Solid Waste and Recycling
Programs. Materials are collected by means of
curbside and containerized collection
programs, the leaf and yard waste drop -off
area and the operation of a resource recovery
center located on Mt. Wayte Ave. The
Division collects and manages the collection 
73
Page 102
Town of Framingham
of refuse and recycling from 19,503 dwelling
units weekly, averaging more than 3,900 stops
and 159,078 pounds per day collected.
In 2008, the Division continued to see the
positive results of our town wide
comprehensive recycling initiative. While our
curbside trash tonnage remained relatively
unchanged compared to 2007, our curbside
recycling tonnage increased by over 730 tons.
This represents a 
trash disposal cost
avoidance of $ 61,609. Ouroverallrecycling
rate has now increased from 33% for 2007 to
35% for2008. TheMassachusetts state
average 
is 30 %.  This demonstrates a vast
improvement in Framingham's recycling rate
from the 23% we were at four years ago. The
recycling initiative continues to encompass
four major parts:
1.  School and Municipal participation;
the school recycling program continues to
succeed and grow. The program is now
institutionalized in most of Framingham's
schools. In addition, many of the schools
have expanded their program and now
include cafeteria recycling as well. The Abitibi
paper recycling containers have also been very
successful, collecting over 400 tons of mixed
paper for recycling. Framingham isnowthe
largest generator in the northeast region of the
country participating in the Abitibi program.
The successes of these programs have allowed
us continued cost savings by reducing
container size or collection frequency at many
of our public schools. Our school program
has now become a  state model for the
successful implementation of recycling in
public schools.
2.  Public Education; 2008 marked our
first year with a focused monthly theme and
events. Some of these themes have
encompassed targeted programs such as:
paper recycling, plans for bottles and cans,
household hazardous waste, composting and
yard care, recycling and the economy. Others
have been linked to an event. One example
was the school wide poster contest last
Public Works 
2008 Annual Report
Septemberpromotingzerowaste. Firstprize
winners of the contest received bicycles
donated by local retailers. Another eventwas
the Shred Fest. This event allowed resident to
have their confidential documents shredded
and recycled free of charge. Framingham
generated more tonnage from this event than
both the City of Boston and the City of
Worcester that held identical events.
3.  Enhancements and Initiatives; Single
stream recycling, or all in one container,
continues to be well received and successful.
During 2008 the division provided over 1,000
yellow, 32 gallon recycling containers. Single
stream and the use of these larger containers
continue to play a significant role in increasing
our recycling rate. Currently the division is
exploring the possibility of even larger
containers in the future.
4.  Compliance education program; since
2006, the Division has issued over 10,000
non -collection and non -compliance notices.
These notices were issued for various reasons
such as: excessive recyclables or yard waste
intended for curbside disposal ( violates State
Waste Bans),fees required and hazardous
wastes. The three 35 gallon trash barrel limit
enforcement program has been successful.
95% of Framingham is now in compliance
with the trash barrel size and volume
limitations. Without the current policies the
resulting cost saving would not have been
realized. While most residents comply with
the Town's solid waste requirements,
regulatory compliance efforts will continue.
5.  TheResource Recovery Center
located on Mount Wayte Ave, continues to
improve and provides the Department the
opportunity to expand upon the services
offered. Last year the Division issued 6,679
permits to residents providing access to the
solid waste services offered at the facility.
This represents an additional 200 permits
issued over 2007. In addition to the
hazardous and hard to manage wastes
collected, the center collected 1,164 tons of
recyclables. This represents atrashdisposal 
74
Page 103
Town of Framingham
cost avoidance of $ 98,067. The Town has
also partnered with the Town of Wellesley in
the marketing of recyclables. This has
allowed a  greater revenue stream to be
produced for the recyclables received.
Through fees collected for divisional services
and marketing of the recyclables $199,872 was
generated forthe General Fund. The center
continues to provide excellent service at
reduced costs to the residents as well as
generate a significant revenue stream for the
town.
The 2007 reorganization of the yard waste
drop -off area has produced significant savings
and benefits in  2008. The current
configuration dramatically increased
Department oversight of the materials
accepted. As a result, we have been able to
partner with the Town of Needham for the
disposal ofa portion ofthese materials. This
partnership reduced the cost of the disposal
from a high of $9.70 per yard to $30 per yard.
Although the costs of trucking and fuel have
increased significantly, the collaboration has
allowed this budgetary account to remain level
funded. The facility received, processed and
handled over 11,000 yards of brush, grass and
leaves from residents and the Park and
Recreation Department during 2008. In
addition to providing free compost to
residents, for the first time the division was
able to market and sell over 1,000 yards of
finished compost. Once again avoiding
disposal costs and generating revenue for the
town.
Water &  Wastewater Management

The Water and Wastewater Management
Program is responsible for the provision of a
drinking water supply, a  fire suppression
service, and a sewer collection service to the
70,000 residents of the community that it
serves.
Public Works 
2008 Annual Report
The Water Department is responsible for the
distribution of a public potable water supply
and for the provision of fire suppression
service to the 17,000 residential and
commercial accounts within the Community.
The average daily water demand of nearly
eight million gallons per day (  mgd) is
purchased from the Massachusetts Water
Resources Authority (  MWRA) and is
subsequently distributed throughout the
Town by means of a complicated system of
pumps, pipes, valves, and reservoirs. The
Water Department program provides for the
maintenance and repair to the water
distribution infrastructure that includes; 250
miles of pipe, 17,000 service connections,
2,000 hydrants, 4,800 gate valves, 22,000
meters, four pumping stations, three booster
stations, and six above ground water tanks
having a  storage capacity of nearly nine
million gallons.
The Sewer Department is responsible for the
collection and transport of 10 million gallons
of sewage each day, a significant portion of
which is infiltration and inflow ( I /I) from
sources such as leaking pipes and sump pump
discharges during wet weather. Sewage is
conveyed from Town systems to the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority
MWRA) which is charged with the transport
and treatment of sewerage from its forty -three
member communities. TheTown'scollection
system consists of 226 miles of gravity mains,
18 miles of force mains, 50 pump stations,
6,600 manholes, and over 40 miles of cross -
country sewer -line easements.
The Division's capital improvement programs
have been substantially under funded in
recent decades and, as a consequence, the
critical infrastructure is  experiencing ever
increasing incidents of failure. The system
continued to grow and expand over time, but
the funding for the aging and expanding
infrastructure did not keep pace with capital
needs. As a consequence, the Division was
historically engaged solely in performing
unscheduled maintenance and was unable to 
75
Page 104
Town of Framingham
devote resources performto  critical
maintenance
underscored 
to the system. This is
by the issuance of an
Administrative Consent Order ( ACO) and
Notice of  Noncompliance by the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection (MA DEP) during March 2007.
The ACO requires the Town to undertake
major sewer construction and rehabilitation
projects over several years with the primary
focus of alleviating reoccurring sanitary sewer
overflows, a violation of State and Federal
law. The ACO has several other requirements
including increased staffing levels, major
equipment purchases, implementation of a
SCADA system to remotely monitor and
control pumping stations and strict reporting
requirements. Failure to comply with the
conditions of the ACO can result in
administrative civil or criminal action.
The Department also faces the continuing
challenges of  managing another
Administrative Order originally issued by the
Massachusetts Water Resources Authority in
2003. The MWRA Settlement Agreement
limits the level of sulfide that the Town is
authorized to discharge to the MWRA system
through operational efforts. Sulfide generation
can cause odor and corrosion problems in
sewers which sometimes can be catastrophic.
Activities which the Sewer Department
performs to mitigate the generation of sulfide
include chemical dosing at  selected
wastewater pumping stations, targeted
collection system cleaning and inspection, and
enforcement of  grease interceptor
requirements atfood establishments. Amajor
cause of sulfide is the wastewater detention
time associated with the 50 pumping stations
and 19 miles of related sewer force main
sewer. TheDepartment plans oneliminating
up to eight wastewater pumping stations and
related force mains over the next several years
as part of its Capital program.
During 2008, the Department's Water Master
Plan was finalized which will drive many of
the future Operational and Capital Planning
Public Works 
2008 Annual Report
programs related to the Town's water
distribution system.
In addition, the Department continued the
evaluation of the sewer system with the
completion of the Phase 2 Sewer System
Evaluation Survey (SSES).SSES efforts carry
on the inspections and investigations that
began under the Comprehensive Wastewater
Management Program to help the Town
proactively mitigate sanitary sewer overflows,
sewer back -ups and improve upon aging
infrastructure. Major components ofthe
Phase 2 study included video inspection of
63,000 feet of sewer main, temporary
installation of flow meters at seven locations
to monitor wastewater flows during periods
of precipitation, and nearly 500 manhole
inspections. The findings and
recommendations were submitted to the
Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection as a requirement of the Town's
Consent Order and will be the impetus of
future operational and capital improvement
efforts.
During FY08 the Department contracted for
the acquisition of the Automated Meter
Reading System. Installation is currently
underway. Thesystemisanticipatedto
become fully operational in FY10 and will
provide real time, on demand, water meter
readings and will provide a  substantially
higher level of customer service to water and
sewer customers.
Emergency response was required by
department staff during FY08 to repair more
than 200 water main breaks and 42 sewer
system failures.

Land Acquisition and Stewardship
The Conservation Office implemented the
second year of its land stewardship program,
running 7 workdays or educational days on
Conservation parcels. Efforts focused on
removal of trash and brush, contribution to
Green -Up Day, creation of news trails, and
maintenance of existing trails. The
Conservation Office also coordinates with
Boy Scouts undertaking Eagle Scout projects
on Conservation land. This past year the
Commission sponsored 3 such projects.
The Conservation Office oversaw the
development of the updating of the

effective and efficient delivery of essential
services to the residents of the Community.
These vital services include the provision of
public safety, public works, and public utility
functions for the residents of Framingham.
Fleet Management
In 2008 the Division prepared specifications
for the procurement of the following
specialized equipment: one closed circuit
camera truck, one 68,000 GVW Refuse
Packer, two four wheel drive utility body
trucks with plows. The Division also
prepared specifications for the purchase of
Bio Diesel fuel which was implemented in
February 2009.
The Fleet Services Division has requested
from the Department of Energy Resources, a
Hybrid /Diesel Grant for the cab &  chassis to
be used for the closed circuit camera truck.
This was 
the second winter season the
Department set up a temporary site at the
King School for Technicians who are assigned
to the north side of Town during plowing
events. This has worked very well in providing
the Technicians a more functional work area:
repairs have been performed more effectively.
Fleet Services assisted in the upgrading of the
Saxonville Flood Station for the necessary
repairs to the pump building and the flood
gates on Concord Street.
In 2008, Fleet Services wrote 2 repair
orders, performed 447 scheduled preventative

The Administration and Finance Division
provides for the consolidation of all
administrative and financial functions within
the Department of Public Works. The
Division strives to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of financial and administrative
functions within the Department through the
use of professional practices.
The core mission of the Division of
Administration &  Finance is  to provide
service and technical support to the major
Divisions within the Department of Public
Works: Engineering, Conservation, Highway,
Sanitation, Fleet, Water and Wastewater as
well as providing other Town Departments
with information in a timely and accurate
manner.
In addition to managing the general operating
budgets, the Division of Administration and 
2008 Annual Report
Finance manages funding for all Public Works
capital projects within the Town including
infrastructure repairs that are funded through
state aid. The Division is also responsible for
the management of grant funding, as well as
federal reimbursement activities that are
related to storm emergencies.
Water and Sewer utility billings for the Town
of Framingham are also managed by this
Division. Staff issued approximately 73,000

Communitv & Economic Development
Memorial Building, Rm 132 1  508- 532 -5455 1  planning. department@frainingllainina.gov
The Community and Economic Development
Division (C &ED) undertakes a wide variety of
projects â€” all of which are focused on
protecting and enhancing the quality of life
for Framingham's residents. The projects are
multi- dimensional, ranging from securing
grants and providing policy analyses to
promoting homeownership and strengthening
the tax base by encouraging appropriate new
development.
The Division consists of three departments:
Planning, Zoning Board of Appeals ( ZBA),
and the Community Development office.
While each department focuses on different
planning functions, there are clearly
interrelationships between and amongst the
departments as well as other municipal
divisions, boards and committees. Therefore,
coordination of the interrelated functions
becomes critical.
Planning
The Planning component of the division is
concentrated on both promoting economic
development in order to strengthen and
expand the tax base, and supporting our
residential neighborhoods. Planners, with a
full spectrum of professional expertise and
experience, manage awide variety of projects
and provide policy analyses requested by the
Town Manager, Board of Selectmen, and
other divisions.
Revitali .Ze Downtown
In recognition of its commitment to revitalize
our downtown, the Board of Selectmen
appointed the Director of C &ED as the
Downtown Director. Charged with
coordinating an extensive array of ongoing 
and planned projects, the Director works
closely with DPW, Building and Wires
Department, Town Manger's Office and the
Planning Board as well as state, regional and
federal agencies to insure that all projects are
moving forward in a coordinated as well as
expeditious manner. In addition, C &ED
participates in  the activities of the
Framingham Downtown Renaissance (FDR)
and in the recent efforts to organize the
downtown business owners.
Underlying the Town' s approach to
improving the economic viability of
Downtown Framingham is our recognition
that public infrastructure improvements are
critical to leverage private investment
without public investment to facilitate
vehicular and pedestrian circulation patterns
and beautify the downtown, it is unlikely that
developers will be sufficiently attracted to
invest in the downtown. Accordingly, efforts
are now focused on finalizing plans to install
new sidewalks and period street lighting;
improving pedestrian connections between
various destination points, and involving state
and federal transportation agencies as well as
CSX and the MBTA to develop a feasible
resolution to the rail crossings and rail yard
issuesthat plague thedowntown. Tothat
end, the Town worked hard in 2008 to
reinforce political awareness of the compelling
need to restructure the roadway network and
railroad with our legislators and Lt. Governor.
That effort continues in earnest.
The department is also working to target and
promote the development of major parcels
for (re) development. Althoughthelackof
available credit has seriously undermined the
Planning & Economic Development  83
Page 112
Town of Framingham
progress of several private developments, we
are focused on some of the opportunities
presented by vacant and underutilized
property in the downtown. Working
relationships were established and nurtured
with several major property owners so that we
can partner to plan for the future.
Downtown Rail Crossing / Grade Separation
Planning staff continued to focus on resolving
thedowntown rail crossing issue. Based on
extensive work completed by the Downtown
Rail Crossing Task Force, the Town's
engineering consultant was directed to analyze
several alternatives and develop a final report,
which will be issued in the summer of 2009.
The Board of Selectmen realigned the task
force into an advisory committee to provide
advice to a newly created steering committee
of professional staff and Town officials
charged with managing the final stages of the
report. The report will identify the most
feasible approach to improving the downtown
rail crossing issue. The Steering Committee,
of which the C &ED Director is a member,
works closely with engineering consultants,
State and Federal agencies as well as CSX and
the MBTA, both of which own significant
property in the downtown and are major
stakeholders in the ultimate revitalization of
the town's central business district.
Downtown Streetscape Improvements
The department, in close partnership with
DPW, continued to develop plans for
intermediate improvements that will not be
affected by future decisions relative to rail
crossings and railyards. The Town hopes to
implement these improvements in the next
few years, and is aggressively seeking federal
and state funding. Thisprojectwillclarify
traffic patterns, improve pedestrian safety, and
help revitalize the downtown with improved
infrastructure and beautification.
Transit Oriented Development.
In 2007, the Town received a $50,000 grant
from the State Executive Office of
Transportation and Public Works. This
Planning & Economic Development 
2008 Annual Report
funded a study of pedestrian access to the
MBTA station and the Concord Street retail
spine from the Pearl Street Garage. The
resulting 25% design set for streetscape
improvements will be incorporated into the
plans for Concord Street and other downtown
streetscape improvements.
Bevitali.Ze Neighborhood Commercial Areas
Whereas the downtown is a  focus of our
economic development efforts, it is clearly
just one of a number of projects town -wide
that were undertaken or expanded upon
during 2008. Thecommercial centers in
Nobscot and Saxonville and around Mt.
Wayte and Franklin Streets were identified as
areas that warrant revitalization. Renewed
efforts were made to establish relationships
with the property owners and convey the
Town's willingnessâ€” indeed eagerness to
work closely with them and any prospective
tenants or buyers to revitalize those areas.
Implement Brownfields Project
As a result of an application submitted by
C &ED in 2007, the Town received a $200,000
grant from the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) in April of 2008 to undertake
comprehensive site assessments of
brownfields. Brownfields areproperties that
contain or potentially contain hazardous
substances, pollutants or contaminants that
complicate the property's expansion or
redevelopment. Framingham has a
considerable number ofbrownfields, many of
which are not only a blight on our town but
represent enormous potential to generate
significant new property taxes once they are
abated or it is established that that they are
not contaminated.
Upon notification of the award, the
department immediately started
implementation of the three -year project,
which involves targeting sites, working with
property owners, and hiring a licensed site
professional to conduct site assessments of
selected properties. Significantprogresswas
made, including selecting a highly qualified 
84

consultant and developing a  website
public outreach. 
for
The department submitted an application for
a second round of EPA grant funding in
November in order to focus on property
potentially contaminated by petroleum -based
substances. This category includes gas
stations and former auto dealership and repair
sites.
Encourage Appropriate Economic Development
New development is  one of the few
mechanisms available to expand the tax base,
thereby reducing the financial burden on
existing property owners and /or increasing
the availability of funding to improve
municipal services. In recognition of the
tremendous potential of Technology Park,
C &ED provided assistance to the Planning
Board in its successful efforts to rezone
Technology Park in order to expand its
development potential. The Zoning
Amendments, adopted by Town Meeting in
2008, define and encourage acceptable levels
of expansion of life sciences and research and
development facilities.
The division will continue to partner with the
Planning Board in identifying other sites with
development potential that may strengthen
Framingham's tax base while still
accommodating the needs of surrounding and
nearby neighborhoods.
Protect and Improve Residential Neighborhoods
While economic development initiatives
support residential neighborhoods by
generating additional taxes, C &ED also
undertook projects that were directed
specifically at protecting and improving
neighborhoods. Inlightofseveralnew
initiatives undertaken in 2008, the need to
provide careful and ongoing coordination of
housing -related programs has increased
dramatically. Accordingly, C &ED has
focused on insuring that various projects
within the C &ED Division as well as other
Town divisions are aimed at achieving a
Planning & Economic Development 
2008 Annual Report
common goal and avoiding
duplication of effort. 
conflict or
This year, C &ED coordinated various
interrelated activities focused on improving
neighborhoods including those being
undertaken by the Community Development
Department, Building Department and DPW
through several key planning efforts:
ForeclosureActionPlan: Unfortunately,
efforts to revitalize neighborhoods and
promote homeownership took on a  new
urgency given the dramatic increase in home
foreclosures. Framingham hasnotbeen
immune to the rash of foreclosures that are
endemic to thenation as a whole. Early in
2008, the Building Commissioner initiated a
system to document property in various stages
of foreclosure in order to avoid issues of
blight andabandonment. Subsequently, the
Board of Selectmen instructed C &ED in the
spring of 2008 to focus immediate attention
on this emerging issue. Based on the
monitoring system developed and
implemented bytheBuilding Commissioner, a
team of professionals began to address the
expanding foreclosure problem.
Consequently, in partnership with the Board
of Selectmen and Building Commissioner,
C &ED developed the Framingham
Foreclosure Action Plan, approved by the
Board ofSelectmen inOctober 2008. The
Plan focuses on prevention, management, and
neighborhood stabilization. The team
subsequently concentrated its efforts on
implementing the plan.
Neighborhood Stabilization Plan (NSP):The
Foreclosure Action Plan served as the basis
for an NSP, which was required as part of a
1.6 million grant application for federal
foreclosure assistance administered through
theCommonwealth. The NSP, which was
submitted in January of 2009 for funding,
represents the work of C &ED as well as
DPW including its  GIS (  mapping)
Department, Building Department, and Board
of Selectmen as well as the direct and critically

important involvement of the Framingham
Housing Authority ( FHA) and its subsidiary,
the Framingham Housing Development
Corporation. Theoverridingfocus ofthe
NSP is  to promote homeownership by
converting abandoned property into owner -
occupied homes and thereby stabilize ourneighborhoods.

Develop Marketing Program
There are two fundamental and interrelated
mechanisms to improve the quality of life in
Framingham: strengthenthetaxbaseand
protect our residential neighborhoods.
Marketing Framingham as a desirable and
attractive place in which to live, work and
invest is critical to achieving both objectives.
Working with the Economic Development
Industrial Corporation ( FDIC) and other
partners, C &ED staff began developing a
marketing plan to promote Framingham.
Essentially, the plan will incorporate and
promote many 
of the projects being
undertaken by the division, including its
Foreclosure Action Plan, NSP, Brownfields,
economic development functions and web
sites.
Some of the specific components of the
marketing plan include:
Branding Study: C &ED initiated the process
to hire a consultant to develop a Branding
Study that will identify and focus on
Framingham's strengths in order to capture
both new homeowners and prospective
commercial development. The study, which
will be coordinated with marketing strategies
already in development, is aimed at filling the
vacuum of information available to both
potential homeowners and businesses that
might be interested in relocating hereâ€”if they
knew and understood the merits of
Framingham. For example, the plan will
target, among others, the employees that work
Planning & Economic Development 
2008 Annual Report
throughout Framingham who represent an
untapped market of prospective homeowners.
The Branding Study will also help market
Framingham to its own citizens to help foster
pride and provide them the tools to serve as
ambassadors who can promote Framingham
on a micro level.
Property Clearinghouse: Thedepartment
initiated the creation of a  vacant space
clearinghouse system for the downtown,
which will eventually be extended to other
commercial, retail and industrial sectors
throughout town. The Clearinghouse will
identify vacant and underutilized property,
provide property prospectuses replete with
information, and a system for interacting with
brokers and businesses interested in locating
in Framingham.
Partnership with the Real Estate Community:
C &ED, in conjunction with other Town
divisions, started to develop a partnership
with real estate brokers, bankers and other
lenders to take advantage of the significant
opportunities to link commercial and
residential sectors and to better market the
advantages of Framingham to both potential
homeowners and commercial and industrial
developers.
Marketing WebSite: As part of the NSP,
C &ED initiated development of
www.com, ChooseFmmingham. a  web site
that will promote Framingham as a desirable
place in which to buy a home and invest in
commercial property. Ultimately, this website
will be the digital gateway for those seeking
more information about Framingham. The
ongoing work on this site is being coordinated
with all of the above marketing efforts.
Seek grants
The department continued to monitor the
applicability of grants as well as research the
availability offunding forspecific projects. In
order to insure that all Town divisions are
eligible to receive State grants, the department
annually submits a Commonwealth Capital 
86

application, which essentially grades
municipalities on their success in meeting
State objectives andmandates. Framingham
was 
awarded the 4th highest score in
Massachusetts in 2008, which positions us
extremely well for state grants.
The department is available to provide direct
staff support to divisions throughout the
Town in identifying and preparing grant
applications. As a 
result of C &ED's
assistance to the Parks and Recreation
Department, the Town received a $500,000
State PARC grant to help in  the
reconstruction of Bowditch.
Additional

A $50,000 Mass. Office of Travel and
Tourism grant to fund FDR projects, of
which $30,000 was used for a marketing study
ofNevins Hall. This study positioned us well
for a $50,000 Mass. Cultural Facilities grant
application for studies of  capital
improvements to NevinsHall. Funding
decisions will be made in May of 2009.
In October, C &ED staff prepared a
Recreational Trail grant application for
50,000 to conduct Phase I of the Cochituate
RailTrailproject. Awards willbeannounced
during the summer of 2009.
Policy Analyses, Studies, Project Management, and
Spea'al Projects
C &ED is available to undertake projects,
prepare policy analyses, and coordinate inter-
departmental projects, including the
following:
Transportation: C &ED works closely with
DPW to insure that the Town's transportation
improvement priorities are identified on the
state's Transportation Improvement Plan
TIP),which is a prerequisite for state funding
eligibility. 
2008 Annual Report
Although the Town no longer operates the
LIFT bus system, C &ED maintains a
relationship with the MetroWest Regional
Transit Authority ( MWRTA) leadership in
order to insure coordination of Town and
MWRTA activities.
Open Space Plan: C &ED staff served on the
Open Space Recreation Plan Committee,
conducted research and analyses, drafted
sections of the plan, and reviewed and edited
the final report. The Plan was adopted in
December of 2008.
Parking Study: C &ED hired an engineering
firm to conduct a town -wide Parking Study,
with a particular focus on examining the two -
hour parking limit and the overnight parking
ban. The report will be submitted to the
Board of Selectmen during the spring of 2009.
Cochituate Rail Trail (  CRT):  C &ED is
responsible for the design and ultimate
construction of the 1.3 -mile CRT in
Saxonville. A 99 -year lease with the MBTA
was drafted and is awaiting execution in order
to authorize the Town to use the property for
thetrail. Further, with the help of the CRT
Advisory Committee, the Town selected an
engineering design firm to prepare design
plans forthetrail. C &ED is also working
with DPW to insure that the rail trail is
coordinated with DPW's plans to perform
sewer work along the right -of -way.
Bruce Freeman Rail Trail: The department
manages the planning process to develop the
Framingham component of the proposed 25-
mile rail trail that will extend from Lowell to
Framingham. Land at the trail head, off of
Route 9, was removed from the Town's tax
delinquent list in May of 2008 and an
appraisal for the 3.4 -mile right -of -way was
completed in August. C &ED has been
aggressively seeking grant funding as well as
working with the regional committee
representing all of the communities through
which the trail will traverse.

improvements through MassHousing grants,
issued by the Commonwealth. HOME funds
were also used to initiate the rehabilitation of
six housing units.
Homebuyer Assistance: The program
provided homeownership opportunities to
two low and moderate income households
with a combination of HOME and CDBG
funds. The departmentclosed one loanand
initiated six others, which are anticipated to
close during 2009. Fivehouseholds inthe
income range of 81 -100% of median family
income achieved ownership through the
Program's referral of those households to the
MassHousing Partnership Soft Second Loan
Program.
Code Enforcement: An agreement was
developed with the Building Department to
use CDBG funds to conduct code - related
inspections to properties located in 11 Census

the first phase of the Master Plan and
published the Baseline Conditions Report.
This is  a  stand -alone document that
summarizes the present state of Framingham
in all facets such as land use, transportation,

We look forward to working with the new
tenants of the old Callahan Senior Center in
the Danforth Building. TheBoysandGirls
Club of Metro West moved into this space
and additional arrangements have been made
for access to the Parks and Recreation
department's gym. This new relationship will
help to address the much needed youth at risk
population; some grants have been
implemented to reach this goal.
Arrangements have been made with the
Department of Conservation Services offering
free parking at over fifty Massachusetts State
Parks. Residents were encouraged toreserve
these passes for their enjoyment.
For the first time in the history of the
Suburban Swim League, Framingham finished
with a 10 -0 record, placed first in the Mile

Parks Maintenance
Our efforts to provide well maintained and
safe facilities for all user groups continue to
be an important function of the Parks
Maintenance Department.
The Department provides scheduling
maintenance support for hundreds of other
user groups from the Framingham
Community. Departmental support is also
provided to the athletic programs of three
high schools, Framingham High, Marian High
and Keefe Vocational High School, as well as
the Framingham Middle School athletic
programs. In addition, Framingham State
College and Mass. Bay Community College
rely on the department for a portion of their
athleticprogram needs. We are currently
supporting over 14,000 formally scheduled
events each year on our Framingham facilities.
We have continued our collaborative effort
with KeefeTechnical School. Thismutually
beneficial relationship provides the Town of
Framingham with access to cost effective and
professionally supervised work assignments.
The students are trained in electrical,
carpentry, plumbing, and metal fabrication.
The Town receives quality work while
affording students the benefit of practical
real world" learning experiences in a
commercial setting.
Phase III of Cushing Memorial Park has been
completed. The new entrance on Winter
Street, walking corridors, and landscaping
around the buildings have greatly enhanced
this area.
A new play structure was installed at Mt.
Wayte Park. This has replaced outdated and
non compliant play structures while adding a
useful amenity to this popular site.

phased construction plan has been initiated in
2008 and will continue through 2009.
Through a  cooperative effort with
Framingham State College a  permanent
softball fence and new irrigation system were
added to the Farley Softball Field. These
significant additions as well as field
renovations will increase the use 
and
playability of this under facility.
With the assistance of a  Community
Development Block Grant, new, energy
efficient, lights and fixtures were erected in
the Danforth Gym.
Through our Capital Budget program,
demolition and rebuilding of new grandstands
at Winch Park has been completed and 3
vehicles from our existing fleet have been
replaced.
We began the reconstruction of the Learned
Beach parking lot and drainage systems. It will
be completed in Spring of 2009. This project
will bring the Town closer to compliance with
several Local, State, and Federal policies
associated with storm water management.
We have expanded our beautification plan; at
present there are over fifty -five formally
planted areas that include many Town
memorials, traffic islands and parks. In
addition we have continued our tree pruning
and removal program through our park sites.
Thank you to all Town departments and
volunteer groups for their continued
assistance.

Joan Rastani.
In an effort to make the facility more efficient
and attractive to the town and user groups,
significant upgrades were preformed.
A new Cooling Tower, a key component to
the mechanical systems in the rink, was
replaced. This $40,000 project was largely
installed by our own staff. This upgradewill
now provide for more efficient operations of
the compressors and uses less energy. In
addition, a $4,500 energy rebate was received
from NStar.
In addition to the new dasher boards and

School Committee
Budget
The School Committee began the FY09
budget process with the goal of maintaining a
level service budget. However, given
projected revenues, expected levels of state
and federal funding, and increased district
expenses, a  level service budget was not
feasible and a budget gap of approximately
4.2 million existed between the School
Department' s projected FY09 budget and the
ChiefFinancial Officer'srecommendation. It
was a verydifficult budget process. The
Committee spent a  number of weeks in
budget deliberations, reducing and cutting
programs and personnel as well as increasing
fees. At its May 12, 2008 meeting, the School
Committee voted to request an FY09 budget
appropriation of $87,829. 746, The request
was $ 600,000 above the Chief Financial
Officer' srecommendation. Working closely
with the Chief Financial Officer, Board of
Selectmen, Town Manager and Finance
Committee, an agreement was reached on an
FY09 budget of $87,829.362,
Superintendent Search
As the Superintendent Gene Thayer entered
the second and final year of his interim
superintendency, the School Committee
began its search for a new superintendent of
schools. In September, the School
Committee appointed a 12- member Search
Committee with a  goal to interview and
screen applicants for the position of
superintendent. In an effort to solicit as
much input as possible, the School
Committee scheduled a series of focus groups
to ascertain the community' s interests,
concerns and preferences. An online survey
was available Framingham Public School's
Education & Libraries 
website. Focus group and online survey
results were shared with the Search
Committee and the School Committee to
guide them in the selection process. 
The
Search Committee screened 27 applications
and interviewed 11 candidates, and ultimately
forwarded the names of four semi - finalist
candidates to the School Committee in
December. The School Committee
interviewed semi - finalists in January and
scheduled final interviews in early February.
On February 5, 2009, the School Committee
appointed Dr. Steven A. Hiersche,
Superintendent of Schools, effective July 1,
2009.
School Committee Vacancy
In October 2008, Cesar Monzon resigned his
seat on the School Committee in the second
year 
of his second term. The School
Committee posted notice of the vacancy in
the local newspaper and received letters of
interest from citizens. On December 2, 2008,
the School Committee and Board of
Selectmen convened a  joint meeting and
voted to appoint Diane M. Throop, former
two -term School Committee member, to the
vacantseat. Ms. Throop's appointment is
effective until the Town Election in April
2009.

In my role as Interim Superintendent I  am
pleased to present this report to the Town.
2008 was another busy and successful year for
Framingham Public Schools. The variety of
programs and the pace of activities is clear in
the School Committee and Departmental
reports.
The College Board's Advanced Placement
Program (AP) offers students the opportunity
to take challenging, college -level courses while
still in high school and to receive college
credit, advanced placement, or both for
successful performance on the AP Exams.
Since 2002, the number of students taking the
AP exams has doubled with three hundred
and forty three participating in 718 Advanced
Placement Exams, in twenty one subjects, in
2008. 84% of the exams were passed and
eligible forcollege credit. This compares with
three hundred fifty six who took the exam in
eighteen subjects in 2007.
Through continuing aggressive efforts of the
FHS Guidance Department, 87% of the
junior class and 89% of the sophomore class
took the Preliminary Scholastic Assessment
Test (PSAT). These numbers are impressive
compared to the fact that 65% of the junior
class and 46% of the sophomore class took
the test in 2004. 90% of the graduating class
participated in the SAT. Framingham
students averaged 501 on the Critical Reading
portion, 541 in the Mathematics portion, and
505 on the Writing Component. These scores
compare well with National Averages, which
are 502, 515 and 494 respectively.
The community should be proud that so
many students take and pass a wide variety of
these college -level exams, and that they do so
well. One result of the high student
achievement is acceptance at a college or
Education & Libraries 
2008 Annual Report
university to continue education. In keeping
with past years, more than 85% of the
graduates in the Class of 2008 continued their
education at an impressive variety of
institutions of higher learning, including some
of the most selective colleges in the country.
Framingham High School Drama Company
went to the 2008 Massachusetts High School
Drama Guild and placed in the semi finals of
the State Champion Tide. They also
participated in the North Shore Music Theater
Spotlight Awards and won 7 awards including
Best Musical. The Drama Company
production of Once on This Island was also
awarded the Moss Hart award by the New
England Theater Conference. That same
organization also named the high school Fine
and Performing Arts Director, Donna
Wresinski, as Theater Educator of the Year.
The band performed at Massachusetts
Instrumental and Choral Conductors
Association where the orchestra received a
bronze medal. The jazz band attended the
International Association of Educators
Northeast Jazz Festival earning a Silver medal
and the jazz combo earned a Silver medal as
well.
The community at large has been a strong
participant in  increasing programs and
activities at all academic levels. The
partnership with the New England Eye
Institute continues through the operation of a
Vision Clinic at the Fuller Middle School.
This was opened in 2004 and continues to be
the only school -based vision center in
Massachusetts. Through a partnership with
Boston University School of Dental Medicine,
second grade students, with parental consent,
receive dental screenings and dental sealants,
if needed. Plans are underway with Great
Brook Valley Health Center to open a health
clinic at FHS. Metrowest Community
Healthcare Foundation has been a  major
financial support, particularly in  the
Wellness" programs evident throughout the
schools.

Town of Framingham
Community support is vital to school districts.
I  am proud of the relationships that the
district has developed with numerous public
and private companies, foundations and
organizations overthelastseveral years. Itis
also gratifying to participate in the strong
collaborative relationship between the
Framingham School Department, and the
Police, Fire, Department of Public works and
the other Municipal Departments. In
particular, the Department of Public Works
has efficiently, and with little fanfare done an
excellent job of cleaning the streets and
sidewalks. Basedonconversationswith
people from Framingham and other
communities, the relationship in Framingham
between Municipal and School Departments
is one of the best in the Commonwealth and
is something we can all be proud of.
The Transportation Department provides a
vital service for the Framingham Public
Schools. Seventhousand students utilizebus
transportation on a  daily basis. The
transportation office continues to work
diligently to ensure our students with safe and
efficient transport. Massachusetts General
Law requires School Departments to provide
transportation to all children within each
respective district. To that end, Framingham
provides school transportation to six hundred
students in  non -public schools in
Framingham. Due to budget constraints, the
School Department moved to a  fee -based
transportation program five years ago for only
those students in grades 7 -12. Fees are
waived for special circumstances such as
children placed in Framingham foster care
homes, homeless students, special education
students andstudents onmedicalwaivers. In
2008, approximately twenty -two hundred
students, of the forty one hundred plus
students in grades 7 through 12 purchased bus
passes.
Financially, the School Department's budget
faced a $600,000 shortfall for FY09. However,
in keeping with the tradition of excellent
Education & Libraries 
2008 Annual Report
support for the education program the Town
was able to provide the $600,000 funding to
achieve a balanced budget for FY09. The
School Department is most appreciative of
the Town's timely and adequate response to
this problem. This year regular reports are
being presented publicly to inform the School
Committee and Town Officials of the
financial status of the School Department.
This is a major goal â€” to establish systems and
monitor the finances to provide a transparent
financial picture for the community.
In addition to the continued pursuit of
educational excellence for our students
through strengthening the curriculum and
educational programs other goals, begun in
2007 -2008 were: to review and, if need be, to
revise the School Choice and Student
Assignment programs; to study and develop a
plan for organizing the administrative
structure of the School System and to finalize
the collective bargaining process with the nine
associations and unions in the department.
In closing I would like to thank not only the
entire staff for their diligent efforts on behalf
of our students but also the School
Committee and Town officials for their
attention to the education ofour students. I
appreciate everyone's willingness to work
together in a positive and productive manner!

Community Healthcare Foundation provided
funding forthis important service. The
United Way of Tri- County Women's
Leadership Council provided funding for a
Women's Health and Wellness" class for 15
women enrolled in morning ESL classes.
Another beneficial collaboration was with
SMOC's "Healthy Habits in the Home"
project funded through the Metrowest
Community Healthcare Foundation.
The program's ongoing collaboration with the
Danforth Museum of Art received a boost
when the museum received a grant which
provided for additional docent training for
work with limited English speaking visitors, as
well as funding to allow for museum visits by
evening classes. Framingham Adult ESL
Plus was pleased to offer two "Introduction
to Computers" classes this semester. Twenty -
five students learned basic computer skills
including e -
mail. Metrowest Bank provided a
Financial Literacy series to Level 4 classes,
which covered banking vocabulary, loans, and
credit cards.
On March 24, Framingham Adult ESL Plus
was highlighted at the annual Metrowest
Adult ESL Fundraising dinner. This annual
event, spearheaded by Middlesex Bank and
supported by many area businesses, raises
funds to support 6classes eachyear. This
year's event included a moving video about
the importance of learning English featuring
Red Soxplayers. Itwas produced as aresult

leader in educating English language learners.
With at least 60 different languages
represented in our school district, it has been
our goal to ensure that each student achieves

Teachers across the district and those from
other districts have participated in a wide
variety of  professional development
opportunities offered by our staff. These
include: assessing English language learners,
sheltering content, and effective instructional
practices forEnglish language learners. This
year, as in past years, we were pleased to have
a number of staff members selected to make
presentations at several important educational
conferences. We also co- sponsored a

Curriculum & Staff Development
The major responsibilities of this department
include 1) curriculum development, review
and implementation; 2) assessment of student
achievement and analysis of data; 3) resource
and program support; and 4) professional
development.
The Curriculum Frameworks from the
Massachusetts Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education continue to guide our
curriculum implementation and revision

English Language Arts, Science and Social
Studies, K -6 Math Study Group and a MS /HS
Foreign Language Curriculum Committee
meet on a regular basis to review and update
curriculum and professional development for
each of these content areas.

School Health Services (SHS) provides daily
comprehensive nursing care to the students of
FPS with one nurse in each school, two at the
high school.
In Spring 2008, SHS was awarded $220,000, a
five -year grant, the Essential School Health
Services program (  ESHS),  from the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health
MDPH). SHS has received funding from
MDPH since 1993. In the past, this funding
has allowed SHS to build a  strong

equipment, including technology. Continued
funding will allow for the maintenance and
improvement of the SHS program.
FPS has a long history of collaboration with
partners engaging in provision of health care
and research. These collaborations continue
with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center /Boston University on the SONIC
study ( a study investigating sun exposure,
moles and melanoma in school -aged children)
and the New England Eye Institute in the
operation of the Vision Center at Fuller
Middle School (  providing comprehensive
vision care to all members of the FPS
community).In Spring 2008, a community -
based coalition was formed to address
increasing teen pregnancy rates in
Framingham. Recently approved proposals to
the Metrowest Community Healthcare
Foundation, the Massachusetts Department
of Elementary and Secondary Education, and
the Massachusetts Alliance on Teen
Pregnancy will fund district efforts to address
Framingham's teen pregnancy rates through
curriculum review and development.
The 16 year -old Teen Parenting and
Pregnancy program, funded by an earmark
through the Massachusetts Department of
Children and Families, experienced a
significant funding cut in October 2008. The
continued existence of this successful and
critical support program for FPS pregnant and
parenting students is in question for the
coming year.
School nurses participate on the Health
Advisory Council. Their participation during
the past year has been integral to the
formation of Wellness Committees in various
schools. SHS is committed to providing
preeminent nursing services to the FPS
community. We look forward to another year
of administering our program.

Special Education Program
The Department of Special Education
provides a broad array of services for children
and youth identified with disabilities from the
ages of three through twenty -two. The
referral, evaluation and placement procedures
are governed by state and federal special
education laws and regulations, namely, The
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
IDEA).FPS is committed to the goal of
providing an appropriate education for
students with special needs in the least
restrictive setting.
The following programs and services were
offered by FPS from Pre -School to High
School: Special Education Resource Rooms
are available in eachschool. TheResource
Room model provides direct teaching in both
special and regular class settings, through
inclusion, supportive teaching and /or
consultation to the regular classroom teacher
of identified children.
There are forty -one Substantially Separate
classes from Pre -School through High School.
These students require comprehensive
programming which is provided outside of
the regular education classroom for more than
60% of the school day. These classes are
located at the High School, three Middle
Schools, at seven Elementary Schools, and at
the Pre -School serving the special education
needs of students throughout the District.
Where appropriate, these students are
included in general education classes and
ancillary activities.
Related services, namely speech /language
therapy, occupational therapy, physical
Education & Libraries 
2008 Annual Report
therapy, adaptive physical education and
services from the teachers of the visually
impaired may be included in a student's
Individualized Education Plan (IEP) and are
provided by itinerant personnel at all schools.
Inclusion programs have been established
using a variety of approaches throughout the
district. Some classes are team -taught, some
classes meet for specific periods, and some
special education teachers are assigned to a
group of classes. In addition, some teachers
who are dually certified in special education
and regular education have full time
responsibility for inclusion classes at the
elementary level.
Framingham is  a  model for Pre -School
Programs for both children with special needs
and typical children ages three to five. The
placement of children with special needs in
the Pre -School Programs emphasizes
language, communication and social skills
development. The majority of children with
special needs in the BLOCKS Pre -School
Program are integrated throughout their
school day with children without special
needs.
Framingham continues to see a significant
increase in the number of children with
autism, with multiple disabilities and medical
needs, with significant social/ emotional
disabilities, particularly at the Pre -School and
Elementary level. The severity of these
disabilities presents challenges to the school
district to develop new and additional
programs in order to maintain these children
in the public schools.
In conclusion, Framingham has continued to
implement and provide a  comprehensive
continuum of programs, services, and
placement options for students with
disabilities. Framingham is fortunate to have
an active Special Education Parent Advisory
Council whose role is to advise the special
education department and to engage parents
of children with disabilities in the schools
through meetings and town wide newsletters.

Title I
Title I  is a  federally funded program that
provides financial resources to districts and
schools with a high rate of students from low -
income families. Five schools, Barbieri,
Brophy, McCarthy and Woodrow Wilson
Elementary Schools and Cameron Middle
School, have "school -wide Title I programs ".
This means that all students in the school are
eligible to receive support through the Title I
program. One school, Fuller Middle School,
has a "targeted assistance Title I  program ",
offering support to students with a
demonstrated academic need.
The Title I grant is used to support struggling
students in literacy and math. At the
elementary level, there are 19 staff members
who provide individual and small group
instruction in literacy and mathematics. At the
middle school level, there are two math
specialists who serve two functions -  remedial
support to small groups of students, as well as
coaching for the other math teachers in the
school.
This year, we have shifted the model of
support at the elementary level. We use
quantitative and qualitative achievement data
to identify students who warrant targeted
interventions. Teachers set specific goals for
these students, then monitor progress towards
those goals on a weekly basis. OurParent
Involvement Initiatives have also shifted, to
be aligned with the goals of the Title I
schools. The Parent Involvement Coordinator
works closely with staff at the schools to
provide support for their parent outreach
activities. This ensures that families receive
consistent and adequate support in their
efforts to help their children succeed in
school.
Title I  is a section of the No Child Left
Behind Act; as a result, this department fulfills
Education & Libraries 
2008 Annual Report
many of the obligations of this Act. One
major component is to provide Supplemental
Educational Services to students from low -
income families. This year, we are providing
the services ourselves, rather than using
outside providers, for over 100 students.
As we look back on 2008, we are proud of the
excellent program we have created. We have
outstanding educators in place who help
parents, teachers and students meet the
rigorous demands of the MCAS and No Child
Left Behind.

With the hiring of a  new Director of
Technology in December, 2008, the Office of
Technology is currently exploring different
methods to address the replacement of dated
technology hardware throughout the district.
While the end -user computer equipment is in
need of replacement, it is  important to
consider the need for district -wide wireless
infrastructure. We plan to invest in expanding
our secure and dependable wireless network
while simultaneously addressing computer
replacement.
During the past year, the Office of
Technology began to research ways to
centralize data stores and provide access to
important student and staff data to the extent
required by each user. With a centralized data
system ( i.e.,all data in one place),it will be
easier to make data -driven instructional
decisions. The research process for a new
data management system is in progress.

Food Services Department
In a effort to enhance the dining experience
of the students and respond to the desire of
the community to move to a more healthy,
contemporary style of food, great strides have
been made in moving away from Process
Foods and increasing "Scratch Cooking" of
fresh ingredients. In the last year the
percentage of in -house made items has
increased to more than 75% of the overall
menu, up from less than 35 %.
During this challenging economic period it is
the goal of the Food Service Department to
keep the cost of all meals as low as possible to
the benefit of the families of the community.
It is our objective to make a  significant
contribution to the general well being, mental
and physical capacity, and learning ability of
each student in the district and afford them
the opportunity to fully participate in the
education process. This will be achieved by
providing all students with wholesome,

nutritious and appetizing meals served at a
cost that all can afford.
The Food Service Department took an
aggressive approach to changing the offering
in all the meals served throughout the
District. The changes with the most impact

Joseph P. Keefe Regional Technical Vocational School
750 Winter Street, Framingham, MA 1  508- 416 -2100 1  info@) orgjpkeefehs.
This annual report is submitted by the
members of the School Committee of the
Joseph P. Keefe Regional Vocational
Technical School in compliance with the
provisions of the Agreement among the
towns of Ashland, Framingham, Holliston,
Hopkinton and Natick.
The Report discusses from the perspective of
the Committee the principal items with which
the Committee was concerned during the
calendar year 2008. It includes the more
significant matters within the sole policy
making authority of the Committee and
matters which the Superintendent /Director
brought before the Committee for
information and consultation. For greater
detail of the Committee discussions the reader
may wish to read the extended minutes of
Committee meetings and the attachments
thereto which are available at the School
office.
This year has been characterized by significant
changes not only in  the School's
administrative leadership but also by
innovations in policies and practices under the
leadership commencing on July 1, 2008 of
Superintendent /Director James M. Lynch.
The transition in leadership included the
recruitment of Ms. Patricia M. Canali,
formerly Assistant Principal of Milford High
School. The seamless nature of the transition
has been due in large part to the selfless
cooperation of the entire staff for which the
Committee is  grateful. The Committee
especially recognizes the service of Ms. Carol
Lydon who continues as 
Administrative
Assistant to the Superintendent /Director and
Ms. Elaine O'Toole who prepares the minutes
of the Committee meetings.
In July 2008 the new Superintendent /Director
told the Committee that: 
our students must be prepared for their next
steps and today that preparation not only
involves employment in skilled positions but
also academic skills that will allow our
students entry into post -secondary
institutions ...We have a  responsibility to
develop citizenship, interpersonal skills, self
esteem, financial literacy and other broad
skills that will allow our young graduates to be
successful in the world of rapid technological
changes ... I have a vision of Keefe Tech. in
the South Middlesex District as a hub of work
force development through our newly
improved Continuing Education. We should
do more to train adults to obtain employment
skills and thereby increase their
competitiveness in the marketplace."
The Committee reorganized in June with the
following results:
Chair:  Nelson Goldin
Vice - Chair: Tassos Filledes
Secretary: Linda Fobes
Treasurer: Jack Keating
Assistant Treasurer: Lawrence Cooper
Highlights of the Year
Lt. Governor Murray's' visit. On December
10, 2008 Lt. Governor Tim Murray selected
Keefe as one of the early schools on his tour
of the Commonwealth' s voke schools. He
addressed the faculty, staff and visitors on the
importance of vocational education to the
state's economy and prosperity and of the
personal and professional opportunities
opened to voke ed students. His timely visit
was 
arranged through the efforts of
Superintendent /Director Lynch and
Committee member A.J. Mulvey.
Holding the Line on Fees. The administration
and the Committee agreed that bus
transportation and sports team participation
should continue to be available without
charge to Keefe students, unlike the policy of
Education & Libraries  114
Page 143
Town of Framingham
at least one district town. After holding the
line on school lunch charges for several years,
the Committee authorized an increase of 25
cents in the current year and an additional 25
cents next year, the second increase being
subject to review ifwarranted. This two stage
increase brings Keefe's charges more into line
with those in the member communities and is
less than the free and reduced lunch
reimbursement rate.
Accreditation by NEASC. Keefe received
continued unconditional accreditation by the
New England Association of Schools and
Colleges Commission on Technical and
Career Institutions. This action followed a
comprehensive review of Keefe in 2007 and
resulted in specific commendations for
Keefe's:
Commitment to data driven decision
making to impact improvement in teaching
and learning;
Commitment to the High Schools that
Work initiative;
Positive school climate and pride in
the school;
Beginning to prepare grade 9 and 10
students for the Science and Social Studies
MCAS tests;
Aligning its curriculum to the Voke-
Tech frameworks to meet the requirements
for the Certificate of Occupational
Proficiency;
Completing the energy management
program and its ongoing efforts toward
increasing the facility's energy efficiency.
Post Graduate Initiative. Keefe now offers on
a  tuition basis technical training to high
school graduates (or GED) who are looking
to further their education in a  technical
training program. Thirteen of the highest
demand programs are open to eligible
applicants who want to earn program
certificates or Certificates of Occupational
Proficiency and who are deemed suitable for
absorption in regular vocational classes. This
program has been approved by the
Education & Libraries 
2008 Annual Report
Department of Elementary and Secondary
Education ( DESE).Enrollees will be included
in our student count for state aid. The
program will not require the addition of staff
or facilities.
Community Projects. Keefe students continue
to gain practical experience under faculty
supervision in house building and other
projects benefiting district towns. This year,
houses are various stages of construction in
Holliston, Natick, and Framingham. Other
project examples include construction of a
public access TV studio at the Fuller School
in Framingham, installation of a  shop
constructed trophy case for Holliston High
School, a display case for the Ashland library,
and electrical renovations in the Hopkinton
Historical Society building.
KeefeTechAlumniAssociation. This year
has seen a  renewed effort to increase
participation in the KTAA with a view to
expanding and strengthening ties between
Keefe Tech and its alumni and their
communities. Apart from the satisfaction of
renewing Keefe founded friendships, an active
association can enhance the image and
reputation of Keefe and assist graduates in
their networking for employment and further
educational opportunities. The Committee
applauded the efforts of Ms. Gayle Vigeant,
Vice -Principal for Curriculum, and Ms. Jill
Cuozzi, an alumna and faculty member, on
behalf of the Association.
Framingham Sewer Easement. Keefe has
negotiated a  mitigation agreement with
Framingham in conjunction with the eminent
domain taking of an easement to be made by
the Town of Framingham at the edge of
Keefe's property near the corner of Winter
and Fountain streets. The easement enables
Framingham to comply with a court order to
relieve potential overflow hazards in the area
and will provide more reliable service to area
residents. The station and its construction will
not interfere with Keefe' s activities and
programs. Keefe continues to own the area 
115
Page 144
Town of Framingham
which will be subject to an easement allowing
the Town to install and maintain the pump
station. Keefe will receive an appropriate
payment for the value of the land area on
which the easement is located. Keefe students
in the relevant vocations will be able to
observe the methods and procedures involved
in this work as it proceeds.
Administration
The Superintendent/ Director realigned the
school's administrative structure to better
achieve the mission of the school. Within the
existing budget, the positions that report
directly to the Superintendent /Director are
the Facilities Manager, the Principal, and the
Business Manager. This structure links
intimately to his office the responsibility for
maintenance of school facilities, student
service and achievement, and financial
management. Reporting directly to Principal
Canali are persons responsible for student
services such as guidance, special education;
special education service delivery; academics;
career technical programs, discipline and
athletics.
School Facilities
During the year the first full season of
operating the energy saving equipment and
program 
installed under agreement with
Siemens Corporation was completed. The
Committee Chair appointed a sub -committee
consisting of Mr. John Kahn; Keefe
Treasurer, Mr. Jack Keating; Business
Manager, Ms. Leslie Lesperance; and Keefe's
auditor, Mr. Alfred T. Hargrave; Facilities
Manager, Domenic Jannetti; and
Superintendent /Director James M. Lynch.
The charge of this committee is to verify that
the savings in 
usage and energy costs
projected and guaranteed by Siemens as the
inducement for contracting for the project are
being realized. That committee, working with
Keefe's consultant, David Ward, and Siemens'
engineering personnel has begun that
assignment which had not been completed as
of the end of the year.
Education & Libraries 
2008 Annual Report
School and Personnel Security
In January 2008 the Committee received and
approved a school security report and plan
that reviewed and updated existing security
measures. The plan included an ongoing
program for communicating with parents
through an emergency phone call system and
establishing and training a school security
team. During the year consideration was given
to enhanced equipment and procedures
including: surveillance cameras for the
building; cameras on school busses;
professional development for school bus
drivers and school staff regarding security and
the need for front entrance improvements to
improve visitor control and monitoring. The
open nature of the school structure and the
continuing policy of facilitating public use and
access require the administration to seek a
balance between those considerations and the
goal of achieving rigorous security.
Personnel Relations
The Committee approved revisions to the
Non -Bargaining Personnel Policy which
applies to Secretarial and Information
Management Personnel, Teaching Aides and
Associates and Teaching Assistants. The
policy changes included an incremental
increase in the contribution of the school to
the cost of health insurance premiums so that
for Fiscal Year ending June 30, 2008 the
employees will pay 30 %,  in FY 2009 28% and
in FY 2010 25 %. In view of the proposed
increase in premiums under the current plans,
consideration was given to whether Keefe
should join the Massachusetts Interlocal
Insurance Association Health Benefits Trust
which would provide benefits identical to
those of the Blue Cross plans.
Administrative Leadership
As noted above, as of July 1, 2008 James M.
Lynch succeeded Peter Dewar as
Superintendent /Director. Mr. Lynch's
selection was the result of an extensive search
by a committee consisting of Committee
members Tassos Filledes (  Chair);Nelson
Goldin, Dr. Esther Hopkins and John Kahn.

The Search Committee received 12
applications and proposed three finalists to
the full Committee. Site visits to the finalists'
current campuses were followed by interviews
by the full Committee. Mr. Lynch had
previously served Keefe in a  variety of
vocational and administrative positions, most
recently as Principal following the retirement
of Mr. Karl Lord and his appointment was
endorsed unanimously by the Committee.
In July 2008 Mr. Lynch appointed to the
position of Principal Ms. Patricia Murray
Canali who had served as the Assistant
Principal at Milford High School since 2006.
She had previously been Director of
Guidance Services and high school guidance
counselor at Mendon -Upton Regional School
and at Milford High School. She had had 11
years of experience as a vocational guidance
counselor at Assabet Valley Regional
Vocational High School.
Ms. Canali in her introductory comments to
the faculty and staff described a number of
initiatives she would seek to implement during
her first year, including as the first three:
student assessment, student retention and
recruitment and development of expectations
for student learning. She expressed
appreciation to her new associates for having
warmly welcomed me to the Keefe Tech
family."
Student Enrollment
In June Superintendent /Director Dewar
reported to the Committee on efforts by his
administration to attend to the need to
increase enrollment. Outreach is done to both
middle and high school students and parents
through contacts with district schools'
guidance counselors, open houses, scheduled
school visits and Keefe's career
exploratory/ sports camp. 
specific recommendations 
He made no
for enhanced
efforts, but noted the importance of the issue
for the incoming Superintendent /Director.
Education & Libraries 
2008 Annual Report
In September Mr. Lynch established an
Advisory Committee to the Superintendent
concerning enrollment. The Committee
consists of the Principal, Mrs. Canali; the
Director of Student Services, Jon Evans; the
Internship and Recruiting Specialist, Faith
Chrisom; Committee members John Kahn
and Bill Gaine. Six teachers were
subsequently added: Patricia Boyd, Erin
Bengiovanni, Bill Gibbons, Marie Stefanini,
Tom Iglesias and Amy Snyder.
In November the Superintendent reported his
analysis ( as of the latest available figures â€”
October 1, 2008) of the percentage of
students in grades 9  through 12 in the
member towns that attend Keefe:
Framingham -  22 %,  Ashland â€”  6.5 %,
Holliston â€” 2.5 %m Hopkinton â€” 2% and
Natick â€” 5 %.
The committee proposed a number of steps
to improve recruiting that are being
implemented. In summary they include:
beginning recruiting efforts as early as the 6th
grade and focusing on parents as well as
students; inviting the entire 8th grade
population to Keefe for a 
full day
familiarization program; better informing
guidance counselors in the district schools of
the programs and opportunities available at
Keefe; using Keefe alumni, the evening school
brochure and the Summer Discover Camp to
further promote the Keefe experience with
students and parents.
Curriculum Planning & Development
A number of initiatives this year are aimed at
increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of
Keefe's delivery of academic instruction. For
example in order to enable students who
encounter the school's disciplinary procedure
to benefit academically there is increased
emphasis on in- school suspensions. This
program will require those students to pursue
academic work in a  supervised restrictive
environment thus reducing Keefe's
suspension rate and improving both student
behavior and academic progress. 
117
Page 146
Town of Framingham
Keefe will initiate an eight ( 8) period day
which will allow inclusion of a  reading
program, more academic electives, specialty
computer related courses such as computer
aided design (CAD),more health and physical
education offerings, and a true college prep
track for juniors and seniors with post-
secondary education plans.
On  the vocational side, the
Superintendent /Director presented an
analysis of Keefe's vocational programs as
compared with those of other voke schools.
Excluding the vocational agricultural schools,
the analysis showed that there are
approximately forty three (  43) general
categories of voke offerings ranging from the
traditional such as plumbing and carpentry to
the more technical such as Design and Visual
Communications and Office Technology.
Keefe offers vocational choices in 14 of the
courses most frequently offered by voke
schools. Among the courses most frequently
offered by other voke schools that Keefe does
not presently offer ( apart from inclusion in
other areas of instruction) are Marketing,
Drafting, Electronics, Machine Tool
Technology and Auto Collision. The
Superintendent /Director intends to use this
information in reviewing the present Keefe
offerings and considering possible changes or
additions.
The administration explored the possibility of
securing a  grant for development of an
expanded time in learning program. If the
grant were awarded and a  program
implemented it would better enable Keefe
students to earn competency determinations
in the four content areas of Mathematics,
English Language Arts, Science and Social
Studies as 
well as earn a  Certificate of
Occupational Proficiency in their vocational
technical majors. It will become increasingly
difficult to prepare our students for these
achievements in the environment of a six (6)
hour 180 day school year. While this highly
competitive grant ( 67 awarded out of 213
Education & Libraries 
2008 Annual Report
proposals) was not awarded, the Keefe
community must soon meet the challenge of
providing this expanded learning opportunity
to its students.
Financial
The outcome of the Keefe budget process for
the fiscal year ending June 30 2009 (FY'09)
with the resulting assessments is reported in
the individual district towns' financial reports.
It is important to note, however, that the
responsibility of the Committee extends
principally to developing an operating budget
that will sustain an appropriate learning
experience for all Keefe students whatever
their readiness, ability or prior school
experience may be.
The ultimate assessment upon each member
community is driven not only by the total
budget as recommended by the Committee
but by the amount of state aid received, by the
minimum required contribution of the
community as determined by the Department
of Revenue and by the percent of the student
body originating from each member town.
Moreover, while striving to maintain and
enhance the level of academic and vocational
achievement of its students Keefe operates
on, essentially, an open admissions policy,
accepting students on a non -competitive basis
which has a justifiable impact on per student
costs.
The budget sub -committee for FY 2010
consists of Dr. Kane (Chair);Ms. Arias, Ms.
Knowles, Ms. Giargiari, Dr. Hopkins and Mr.
Gaine. The preliminary budget provided by
the Superintendent /Director seeks in these
difficult times, to adhere to the policy of
providing an appropriate educational
experience for all students, but will defer all
additional equipment or staff expenses,
except, as to the latter, increases driven by
bargaining agreements previously agreed upon
and advances in health care premiums.
The Committee began consideration of how
best to implement an accounting requirement 
118
Page 147
Town of Framingham
recently imposed on public entities by the
General Accounting Standards Board â€” the so
called GASB 45 requirement. This accounting
standard parallels one previously imposed on
private enterprises that have accrued but
unfunded liabilities for providing post
retirement health care benefits for employees.
The first step requires reflecting on the
financial records of the entity the actuarially
determined present value of the liability. That
step is followed by the creation of a vehicle,
such as a trust fund, in which to accumulate
and segregate assets devoted to the payment
of those health care benefits as they become
due. At some point, though not at the
moment, it will be mandatory for entities to
begin to provide those funds out of current
revenue. This procedure differs from the
common current practice, followed by Keefe
and many other public entities â€” including our
member towns- of providing such benefit out
of current revenues in the year in which they
become due.
Failure to adhere to GASB 45 and, when
applicable, funding requirements, will
adversely affect the ability of a public entity to
raise funds for capital improvements through
borrowing. Giventheage ofKeefe's facility
and its mechanical systems, and despite the
care and maintenance provided over the years
by Keefe's facilities managers, we must expect
the need for capital maintenance and
improvements that cannot be met from the
annual operating budget.

remain
appreciative of the strong support received
from Town Meeting Members, the Standing
Committee on Education, the Finance
Committee, the Capital Planning Committee,
Board of Selectmen and Town Manager's
Office, as well as the Office of Chief Financial
Officer.
Facility Improvements
Capital improvement projects completed at
the McAuliffe Branch Library included:
renovation of the delivery, technology and
storage areas. Also undertaken, was the
planning and design phase for a new boiler
and other components of the HVAC system.
We are appreciative of the assistance we have
received from Jim Egan of the Building
Services Department in regards to this
important project.
Capital improvement projects undertaken at
the Main Library in  2008 included:
renovations to all public restrooms to replace
worn plumbing fixtures and bring facilities in
compliance with all ADA regulations. State -
of- the -art presentation equipment was
installed in public meeting rooms, greatly
expanding the usefulness of these valuable
community resources. Also undertaken in
2008, was a  comprehensive study of the
parking garage facility that identified present
conditions that will require corrective repairs.
Finally, cafe tables and chairs were installed in
the Main Library lobby thanks to the
generosity ofthe Friends oftheLibrary. This
new component to library services provides a
welcoming place for patrons to meet and
enjoy a cup of coffee.
Technology Improvements
Enhancements to the Library's computer
network moved forward with the cooperation
of the Town' s Technology Services
Department and the Minuteman Library
Network. In 2008, the Library added more
computers, updated older hardware, invested
Education & Libraries 
2008 Annual Report
in time saving software, and dramatically
increased the responsiveness of the staff and
publicnetworks. The Friends oftheLibrary
generously provided the funding for the
purchase of additional Internet access that
permitted the creation of a  second staff
network that has greatly improved
productivity. Patrons have benefited from
additional computers connected to the
Internet and new computers designated for
word processing assignments such as resume
writing. Wireless access to the Internet was
installed throughout the Main Library.
Installation of wireless at McAuliffe is
scheduled for early 2009.
Grants
The Library received several grants in 2008.
The Massachusetts Board of Library
Commissioners awarded the Library a
7,00500. Community Reads grant. This
grant will be used to initiate a series of Town -
wide events centered on the community -wide
reading of a selected book. The Library also
received funds from the Community
Development Department to support the
Literacy Unlimited program.
Friends of the Library
The Friends of the Framingham Public
Library Association, Inc. continued their long
tradition of dedicated work on behalf of the
Library. The Friends, through their monthly
book sales, raised thousands of dollars to
support collections, programs, and special
projects â€” several of which have been
highlighted in this report. Please consider
joining this special group of library
supporters.
Reaching Out To The Community
Library staff collaborated with many
community organizations, including the
Framingham Historical Society &  Museum,
Town -wide PTO, the START Framingham
Partnership andtheBoardofHealth. Staff
also attended registrations for the
Framingham Adult ESL Program (FAESL),
and provided library information at tables for 
120

a health fair, and the multicultural fair. We
regularly attend meetings of the Framingham
Community Partners. We delivered 1300
copies of our " Look Here First" library
newsletter to 38 organizations throughout
Framingham.
The Library continued to do an outstanding
job of meeting the needs of its patrons. In
FY2008, the total system -wide circulation,
including interlibrary loans was 898,953. A
total of 368,686 visits were made to the
Library this year, an average of 7,090 visits per
week. Atypical week recorded 1,911 uses of
Internet and electronic resources and 1,934
referencetransactions. Presently, there are
33,225 town residents with an active
Framingham Public library card.

CAPITAL BUDGET COMMITTEE
The Capital Budget Committee (  CBC)
consists of six Town Meeting Members
appointed by the Town Moderator, and one
representative from the Finance Committee.
The role of the CBC is to recommend to
Town Meeting for approval all capital projects 
with a cost of at least $25,000 and an expected
useful life of five years.
This year at the Annual Town Meeting, the
CBC recommended for approval General
Fund projects amounting to $13,744.098,
Included in the total was approximately
8,000000, for the Bowditch Field project.
The source of funding for all of these General
Fund projects was 
from bonding. The
requested projects included the following
departments: Fire, Library, Parks and
Recreation, Police, Public Works, Highway,
Sanitation, Schools and Tech Services.
In addition the CBC recommended to Town
Meeting Enterprise Funds projects totaling
30,399. 278, The projects were as follows:
Water Enterprise Fund $ 21,938235, and
Sewer Enterprise Fund $ 9,461. 042, The
sources of funding were $1,711599, from
Water and Sewer retained earnings and
28,688678, from bonding. A substantial
portion of the bonding projects will be at
interest rates of 2% or less.
It was a very challenging year for the CBC.
The Committee made some very difficult
decisions due to limited Town funds and a
never ending list of capital projects requested
by the various Town departments /divisions.
The Committee plays a very critical role in the
long -term future of the Town's infrastructure.
We will continue to work closely with the
Chief Financial Officer in order to make
recommendations of projects that benefit our
Town, while maintaining fiscal responsibility.

CELEBRA ri Â®N COMMITTEE /FLAG DAY
The Framingham Celebration Committee
once again sponsored its Flag Day Festival on
June 14`'' &15`''2008 at Cushing Veteran's
Memorial Park. More than 200 Civil War Re-
enactors came from all over New England, as
well as from other states, to participate in the
festival. They began by making camp on
Friday night and settling into a quite night of
cooking over an open fire and trading stories
of past events. Many of the participants
included soldier's wives and children who
camped out and slept in authentic period
tents. Each of the participants pitched their
tents in either the Union or Confederate camp
which were kept separate, just like it was
during theCivilWar. As the morning
approached, the smell of fresh coffee was in
the air as each camp prepared for the battle
scene by doing drills and cleaning their
muskets.
The battle re- enactment, dubbed "The Battle
of Farm Pond ", was staged with both infantry
and cavalry from the Union north and
Confederate south. This fictional Civil War
battle ( there was no real Civil War action in
Framingham) was waged for about an hour
on a large open field within Cushing Park.
There were many spectators who enjoyed
cotton candy and filmed the action with their
digital cameras. The festival included re-
enactors convincingly portraying both Union
General Ulysses S. Grant and Confederate
General Robert E. Lee
The more than 100 antique muskets involved
produced huge clouds of smoke as the north
infantry fired in unison and the south
returned fire.

Participants in this " living history" enjoy
performing for the public as a hobby during
numerous Civil War re- enactments across the
US. They make friends, get a chance to camp
out and learn first -hand what it was like to live
during the Civil War era. As the first day
ended there was music and laughter heard
from each camp despite some brief but heavy
rains. The nextmorning brought sunshine to
the camp and the re- enactors prepared for
another day of making history come alive!
Other elements of the event included the
annual flea market and craft vendors, musical
groups and attractions for the kids. There was
entertainment for all  ages, including
performances from Dan Clark "the singing
trooper" and the Natick American Legion
Band.
Our patriotic procession once again honored
all veterans, past &  present. The parade
around the park included musket fire and
patriotic marching music. The traditional Flag
Retirement Ceremony closed the event at the
end of the day Sunday and was a moving
display ofpatriotism. Our thanks go to those
veteran's who assisted in the ceremony.
Thanks go once again to the following
organizations for their support and assistance:
Framingham Park & Recreation, Framingham

DISABILITY COMMISSION
The Framingham Disability Commission

some of the activities the Disability
Commission has been involved with to ensure
access for all residents.
We were involved with the 2008 revision of
the Open Space and Recreation Plan
General Committees 
2008 Annual Report
Committee ensuring that the plan
incorporated the needs of persons with
disabilities. Also, we continue to be involved
with the MetroWest Regional Transportation
Authority (MWRTA).Recently the MWRTA
formed a  RIDE Task Force to ensure a
smooth transition from the current MBTA
RIDE service to the new MWRTA
MetroWest RIDE service.
Though we are pleased the town went
forward and conducted an ADA Self -
Evaluation and Transition Plan in 2006 we are
hopeful that the recommendations outlined
are implemented.
During these tough economic times it is
imperative that as a town we continue to
move forward after having already
accomplished so much. I am hopeful that the
ADA Transition Plan Subcommittee, which is
responsible for overseeing and implementing
the ADA Plan, will reconvene and meet
regularly so they can prioritize what needs to
be done and ensure that the town is in
compliance with disability laws.
With the monies from the Handicapped
Parking Fine account we were able to give
500 to the Callahan Senior Center for
Emergency Transportation. Also we gave
money for two important projects for the
Framingham Public Library. The Library
requested $5,130 for a Playaway portable
audio books which is a collection of digital
audio titles. They also requested $4,200 for an
accessible computer workstation as well as
some hand held devices. Both of these
projects enable the library to better serve
patrons who are blind, have low vision,
reading disabled, have learning and physical
disabilities.
We would like to thank the town
departments, the Selectman's Office and
Town Meeting members for their continued
support of our programs and activities.

FINANCE COMMITTEE
The Finance Committee consists of nine
members appointed by the Town Moderator
for a term of three years. 
The Finance
Committee recommends action to Town
Meeting regarding the budget and other areas
of finance. Other key responsibilities include
authorizing disbursements from the Reserve
Fund for emergency expenses, authorizing
deficit spending for emergency winter -related
expenses, approving the expenditure ceiling
for revolving funds and monitoring the
Town's annual audit.
The FY 2009 budget review process was
streamlined and prioritized to maximize
efficiency and to allow the Committee to
focus on financial issues beyond the annual
General Committees 
2008 Annual Report
budget. TheCFOanddepartmentheads
worked together to resolve any disparities
between requests and the CFO's FY 2009
budget recommendations before the Finance
Committee received the budget. The
Committee invited the five largest divisions
64% of projected FY09 budget),including
Police, Fire, Public Works, Keefe Technical
School and the Framingham Public Schools to
present their budgets to the full Committee.
Smaller departments that requested budget
increases beyond level services also came
before the full Committee. The CFO
presented the budgets for other smaller
departments and unclassified expenses to the
Committee.
The Finance Committee's written report to
Annual Town Meeting was expanded from
prior years, and included many charts and
tables to help Town Meeting members better
understand the FY2009 budget. Because the
School Committee was continuing to work on
their budget when the original report was
issued, a  separate report on the School
Department Budget was issued. The FY 2009
School Department Budget was $ 600,000
greater than that recommended by the CFO.
Ultimately, Town and School Department
management was able to negotiate a
compromise that avoided further cuts in
educational services through cost savings
within the School Department and a small
contribution from the municipal budget.
In 2008, the Finance Committee also focused
on several other key financial issues. Inthe
first half 2008, the Finance Committee
reviewed the school's financial data, including
any potential deficit, monitored the increasing
legal budget for large litigation cases, and
monitored the progress of collective
bargaining. In the fall of 2008, the Finance
Committee reviewed warrant articles for Fall
Town Meeting and conducted a  detailed
review of two smaller departments,
Inspectional Services and Community and
Economic Development, that have had
increases in headcount over the past few 
125

years, to ensure that funds are being used in
the most effective and efficient manner.
Second, the Committee also completed its
analysis on the potential cost savings on
retiree health care benefits and recommended
adoption of Section 18 of Chapter 32B
M.L. G.in the Fall Special Town Meeting.
In addition, the Finance Committee also
authorizes disbursements from the Reserve
Fund foremergency expenses. During2008,
the Committee approved a FY 2008 Reserve
Fund transfer of $250,000 to partially fund the
Snow and Ice deficit for fiscal year 2008 and a
FY 2009 Reserve Fund transfer of $58,141 to
fund emergency repairs on the Danforth
Buildingheating system. The FY2008 Snow
and Ice Deficit was $ 1,000370, after the
transfer from the reserve fund. This deficit
was rectified in the Fall 2008 Special Town
Meeting. Nochangesintheexpenditure
ceiling for revolving funds were needed in
2008.
The Finance Committee' s Audit Review
Subcommittee reviewed the Town's FY 2007
Audit Report and presented the results to the
FinanceCommittee. Most audit issues have
been addressed, and efforts are ongoing to
develop an internal audit function and to
document the Town's internal control
procedures using the COSO model, in
accordancewith currentauditstandards. The
Finance Committee reviewed specific
concerns with the School Committee about
audit findings related to the student activity
funds, school building use billing system, and
employee time and effort records for federal
grants that extended over multiple years. The
Finance Division and School Business Office
have collaborated to address these issues.

This was a difficult year for the Government
Study Committee due to changes in leadership
and membership. GSC's past Chair, Bill
Haberman, chose not to runfor another term. On
August 18th, the GSC vote to select a new
Chair was split 4 -4 for Yaakov Cohn and Joel
Feingold. The two decided on a " power
sharing" agreement that was unanimously
approved. Mr. Cohn would be Chair and Mr.
Feingold would be Vice Chair and would lead
an effort to get moving on the research and
discussion of potential changes in our
government structure that could become the
basis of a  recommendation to a  Charter
Commission. In early 2009, Mr. Cohn needed
to resign the Chair for personal reasons. To
this date no quorum has been reached to
affirm a transfer of the Chair to Mr. Feingold,
as has been requested by the Town Clerk and
Moderator, although Mr. Feingold is
functioning as  Chair in  fact.
The GSC proposed an important change to
the composition of the Zoning Board of
Appeals: Full voting membership was to
increase from 3 to 5, with a supermajority
required for a variance ( 4 yes votes) and
Associate Members were to be reduced to 2.
The GSC met with the ZBA to discuss their
concerns. Following further consideration the
GSC voted 8 to 0 to support this change. Due
to misunderstanding of the procedural issues,
the Bylaw was filed incorrectly. In addition,
there was considerable opposition to the
adjustment of the ZBA composition, and the
change has not been implemented. Further 
126
Page 155
Town of Framingham
discussion on this issue led to a [6 -1 -1] vote in
favor of tabling this item.
In 2008 GSC also considered whether the
Town would benefit from a  Charter.
Generally speaking, the GSC favored a
Charter. However, the process is difficult and,
once a Charter Commission is elected, that
group can propose any structure it wants. The
GSC has not grappled with the innumerable
questions that arise when considering a
Charter and thus has not developed a set of
recommendations to provide the potential
elected Charter Commission. As part of this
process Joel Feingold created a complete
chart of the Town Government structure,
including all branches of the government,
elected officials, and all appointed and
standing committees. Significant discussion
was held about the relationship between
Capital Budget Committee ( CBC),Finance
Committee, and Ways and Means Committee,
in particular, whether non -Town Meeting
Members might be allowed on the CBC in
order to have a  larger pool of qualified
volunteers. No consensus was reached.
Considerable discussion took place about the
relative power of the Board of Selectmen and
Town Meeting, as it applied to the former
question. There was a general consensus that,
as there seemed to be a  larger political
question in the Town about this relationship,
it  was better that GSC make no
recommendation for change in  CBC
membership requirements at this time.
Throughout the year GSC also reviewed and
commented on other bylaw changes as
submitted by various parties, per its defined
mission in  our  Bylaws.

Joel A. Feingold, Acting Chair
GREENER FRAMINGHAM COMMITTEE
The Greener Framingham Committee has
been charged with the task of investigating
our municipal energy costs and consumption
and finding ways to reduce both. We have
General Committees 
2008 Annual Report
collected three years worth of energy data to
establish energy benchmarks. We have taken
tours of buildings, and invited NStar reps, and
Town employees to educate ourselves. While
it is clear that many our buildings have made
improvements over time, several including the
Memorial Building, are in need of major
improvements to conserve energy. Lighting
upgrades, motion sensors, and digital controls
would go a long way towards meeting the
Town's energy goals.
However, until those investments in
conservation technology are made, one of the
greatest sources of energy waste remains the
humanfactor. It has been our repeated
observation that the Town's current energy
policy, adopted by the Board of Selectmen in
2007, has not been effectively enforced.
Lights, computers, and other appliances are
frequently left on when municipal employees
are notusing them. Unfortunately, there are
inadequate prompts to encourage folks to
turn them off. In an effort to remind all
employees of the important role they play in
energy conservation, the GFC has teamed up
with the Framingham Schools' Conservation
Committee to sponsor an art contest for
Framingham students to create signs and
posters geared towards energy conservation.
Winning artwork will be distributed to all
municipal buildings.

HIsTORICAL COMMISSION
The Framingham Historical Commission
spent 2008 reviewing demolition applications
and carefully implementing the Town's
Demolition Delay By -law in order to preserve
our history.
Near the end of 2008, the FHC began the
long process of a town -wide review of all
buildings in order to update our Cultural
Resources Inventory. 
127

Town of Framingham
After long discussion and debate, it was with
regret that the FHC allowed the planned
demolition of the grandstands at Bowditch
field, but we look forward to a new facility
that will better serve the Town and its
residents. Members ofthe Commission are
involved in the group designing a memorial
that will be erected on site to commemorate
these important WPA built structures.
The Commission was especially excited to see
restoration work beginning on both The
Edgell Memorial Library and The
Framingham Academy Building.
As always we look forward to the challenges
in the year ahead.

HisToRIC DImicT COMMISSION
The Historic District Commission ( HDC)
administers the Centre Common District
located in Framingham Centre and the
Jonathan Maynard District located along
Pleasant Street from the First Parish Church
to the Mass. Pike.
The five basic purposes of the Commission
are:
1) to preserve the exterior appearance and
harmonious relationships of groups of
buildings and their related structures that
compose an historic landscape designated by
the Town as a local historic district;
2) to ensure that changes and additions are
compatible and enhancing while preventing
incongruous elements that distract from the
aesthetic and historic character of the districts;
General Committees 
2008 Annual Report
3) to conduct public hearings in response to
applications for  Certificates of
Appropriateness and to issue decisions in a
timely manner;
4) to serve as a knowledgeable and educative
resource for the benefit of the districts'
citizens and for the Town;
and 5) to propose the expansion of existing
districts and the creation of new ones when
the situation warrants.
The Commission normally meets monthly on
the second Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. in the
Memorial Building.
This year the Commission took before town
meeting a proposal to extend the Centre
Historic district by adding two elegant and
historic properties: the Train /Vernon House
and the Whitney /Stone House.
In addition the Commission proposed
creating a separate district on Salem End
Road for the Sarah Clayes House which is in
significant disrepair. Town Meeting as it has
in the past, responded favorably.
The Commission has continued to respond to
inquiries from District residents, grant
Certificates of Appropriateness, make non -
applicability determinations, and develop
guidelines for non -compliant properties.

TECHNOLOGY ADVISORY COMMITTEE
2008 was a year of significant transition for
technology in the town ofFramingham. Most
importantly, we saw 
the retirement of
Kathleen McCarthy, the town's long time
Technology Director. The Technology
Advisory Committee would like to thank
Kathleen for her hard work and leadership
and wish her the best of luck in the future.
During 2008, the Technology Advisory
Committee advised various town boards and
committees, as well as Town Meeting, on
several technology projects. The Committee
also played an active role in the hiring process
for the Framingham Public Schools
Technology Director, a  position that was
vacant forthree years. The committee looks
forward to working closely into the future
with the school' s new Director, Adam
Seldow.
The committee also looks forward to 2009,
particularly participating in the hiring process
for the new Technology Director for the town
and bringing communication between the
school department and the town in areas of
technology.

BYLAW COMMITTEE
This committee was formed by Town Meeting
to review the Wind Turbine bylaw that was
referred back at the 2008 Annual TM. It
consists of 2 members from the Planning &
Zoning Committee, 2 members from the

Framingham's annual town meeting began on
April 28 and met 12 times to consider 51
articles consisting of administrative, fiscal,
policy and zoning articles. The fiscal 2009
operating budget saw the most discussion as
Town Meeting approved a  final operating
budget for $202,366957, for the year which
began on July 1, 2008.
Town Meeting also met on five separate
occasions for Special Town Meetings on
March 18, April 30, June 24, October 28 and
December 18. These five special meetings
had a  total of 38 warrant articles for
consideration with the October 28th fall
meeting having a warrant of 24 articles.
Town Meeting members this year totaled 196
of an authorized amount of 216, 12 each from
18 precincts. Vacancies were in precincts 5
1),9 (1),14 (1),15 (3),16 (5),17 (7),and 18
2).Town Meeting members listened carefully,
thoughtfully discussed, debated and voted on
each article presented for their consideration.
Town Meetings are the result of the efforts of
many different people. A special thank you
goes to the Town Clerk and her staff, the
Board of Selectmen, the Town Manager and
his staff, especially the Building Services
Manager and his staff, Town Counsel, and
Media Services. Town Meeting could not
happen without their help.
Also, many hours are spent by the Town
Meeting Standing Committees and the
Moderator appointed committees (  Capital
Budget, Finance, Government Study, Real
Property, Technology Advisory and the
Personnel Board) discussing and developing
articles to be presented to the Board of
Selectmen for the warrants. Each ofthese 
committees and boards are to be highly
complimented for their time and dedication.
Finally, a debt of gratitude is owed to each

members of his staff as well as members of
the Park and Recreation Commission to
evaluate the project. After thorough
discussions, the SCCS voted to support the
project, and it was subsequently supported by
Town Meeting.
We also met with the newly hired director of
Veteran's Services, PeterHarvel. While itis
clear that Mr. Harvel and his staff are doing
the best they can under difficult
circumstances, it is important that we all do

Technical School and the Framingham Public
Library system.
During the course of 2008, the Committee
met with key personnel from each of these
organizations to review their operational and
capital requests prior to the full Town
Meetingdiscussionandvotes. Ultimatelythe
Committee voted to support the budgets of
the Public Library, of Keefe Tech ( with a
caution that continued declining enrollment
would limit future support) and the Public

STANDING COMMITTEE ON PLANNING &
ZONING
SCP &Z meets 10 months of the year and has
had an average attendance of 10 to 12
members. For the 2008 Annual Town
Meeting, we sponsored Article 11 (  Wind
Turbines) as a CitizensPetition. It was, in
fact, co- sponsored by the SCP &Z but was
referred back to the sponsors and it was also
voted to establish an ad -hoc committee to
further study theissue. At the October 28
Spec. TM our committee co- sponsored, with
the Planning Board, Articles 6, 7, 8, & 9 to
define principal and accessory uses and to
make them consistent with the Dept. of
Housing &  Community Development and
Case Law interpretation that " a use not
defined in our Zoning Bylaw is denied."
These four zoning change Articles were
approved by the State Attorney General on
Dec. 23, 2008.

on Public Safety continued in its role to meet
with the, Police, Fire, and Building and
Inspectional Services departments to discuss,
and to vote on, and make recommendations
to Town Meeting on articles that will be
presented at Town Meeting.
We met with Fire Chief 011ie Gadson and
Assistant Chief John Magri and discussed
their plan and need for emergency response
replacement vehicles and continued to
support their long term goal as related to their
capital improvements.
The Committee continued to meet with Chief
Carl of the Framingham Police department
and continues to support their goal to provide
credible service to the town, and their
aggressive approach to seek federal grants for
the Town of Framingham.

STANDING COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC WORDS
As Chair, one of my highest priorities was to
bring closure --  after 15plus contentious years
to the issue of out -of -town water and sewer
billing. Thisactivitywassteppedupon
Natick customers, spurred by the results
obtained in the Ashland dispute.
After the FINCOM recommended spending
25,000 for an independent audit of Natick
customers, the SCPW aggressively followed
up, which included written requests to the
Chief Financial Officer and Town Counsel for
audit data and conclusions, plus the complete
file of the litigation with Interstate Brands
Plaintif ).  As we go to press, the receipt of
the audit is still pending. A taskforce is
reviewing the Continental Bakery case to
determine if there are reasonable grounds to
recommend to  Town Meeting that
Framingham should re -open the agreement
the Town made with Continental in order to
recover the large sums paid to the Plaintiff.
The SCPW will make a report on both items.
As the same time, the SCPW supported all
DPW articles, including the water treatment
plant for the Birch road wells, the Paramount
Pump station for the Genzyme expansion
project sewer improvement, installment of
Town Meeting

town meeting on warrant articles sponsored
by and /or related to the Finance Committee
FinCom),the Finance, Human Resources
and Information Services Divisions, the
Board of Selectmen (BOS),the Town Clerk,
Town Elections, the Legal Department, the
Retirement Board and the Capital Budget and
Government Study Committees.
One town meeting member from each
precinct is eligible to be elected to the
SCW &M. All precincts except for 9 and 18
were represented in 2008. In the process of
reviewing the warrant articles, the SCW &M
meets with involved parties and
representatives of town departments, boards,
committees, and commissions. In 2008 there
were seven special town meetings and the
annual town meeting.
The SCW &M has earned a superb reputation
for conducting credible, thorough analyses,
and composing comprehensive, fact -based
reports and recommendations to assist town
meeting members with the process of
evaluating warrant articles.
The committee had a tremendous impact on
the fiscal 2009 school department budget. The
school committee's final budget request was
for $600K more than the CFO allocated. It
was met with great resistance from town
officials and the finance committee. The
SCW &M worked extensively with the school
department to identify opportunities for
compromise ( to prevent cuts which would
reach further into the classrooms) and broke
from the pack to propose $300K above the
CFO's recommendation. After many meetings
and further negotiation between the BOS,
FinCom, CFO, and school dept.,the parties
agreed to a $200K compromise in an II
hour meeting. The CFO made the motion and
town meeting supported it with a ballot vote
of 120 -29 -1.
The SCWM recommended funding for the
Nexum and SMOC legal cases, which have
significant implications for the town.
Town Meeting 
2008 Annual Report
One issue which stalled on town meeting
floor originated from the Department of
Public Works' (DPW) requirement to install
backflow valves at Eastleigh Farms. The farm
receives free water in exchange for a town
water easement on that property. The
longstanding agreement was not supported by
written documentation. The SCW &M
recommends further research and future
action on this issue.

investigate any facility that has storm water discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity. The exercise ofthis right does not constitute a replacement or substitution for
enforcement by federal or state agencies for facilities that are adequately regulated either under a
NPDES permit or, if a violation is determined to have occurred, under 310 CMR 40.00, the
Massachusetts Contingency Plan.
Watercourse Protection
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall
keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, and other
obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the
watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures
within or adjacent to a watercourse so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use,
function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
Failure by the property owner to maintain the watercourse does not constitute an obligation on the
part of the Town to assume this responsibility.
