Discussion with Mayor Sisitsky: 
Mayor Sisitsky and the Board of Health held a public discussion about instituting an indoor mask
mandate for public spaces. The Board of Health members voiced their support for an indoor mask
mandate. 
Many community members participated in the meeting. The majority of comments were in support of a
mask mandate for indoor public places. There were also individuals who did not support this mandate
and did not think it would be effective. Mayor Sisitsky and Dr. Moore thanked the group for their
participation. Mayor Sisititsky stated he will consider the comments he heard at this meeting and
continue to talk with other groups before he makes any decision. 
Mayor Sisitsky commented that he and the Public Health Director have met several times recently to
discuss issues relating to public health. One topic he wanted to mention was that the Board of Health
will increase to a five-member Board. The Board of Health position is posted on the City’s website and
people are encouraged to apply if they are interested. 
Discussion: Variance renewal process
Ms. DePalo asked the Board to consider options for variance renewals. Should establishments come
before the Board for a renewal? Is there an administrative process that can take place with Health
Department staff? The Board discussed the matter and determined that if there are no material
changes to the variance or legal changes that impact the variance it could be renewed administratively.

Director’s Report: 
•  Ms. DePalo stated that the Health Department had received a distribution of approximately
10,000 COVID-19 antigen test kit from the State in mid-December. The test kits were intended
for individuals who are facing financial hardship. Approximately half of the kits went to
community-based organizations to be distributed to those who are experiencing financial
hardship. Approximately 3,500 of the kits went to the public schools under the leadership of
Mayor Sisitsky. The remaining kits were made available through 2 public distribution events. 
The State has indicated that more antigen test kits will be coming in the next few months to
support K-12 schools and childcare settings. 
•  At this time there continues to be a very serious surge in COVID cases. New case numbers are
higher then any preious surge. Vaccination is encouraged and recommended. Digital vaccine
cards are now available through the State. 
•  The Stop the Spread testing site at Saint Tarcisius Parish is open and serves as a statewide
testing site. This site offers PCR tests. 
•  Home test kit results are not reported to the Health Department. If individuals test positive on
a home test kit they must follow the COVID-19 Isolation guidelines on the city’s website.
