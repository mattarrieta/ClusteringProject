In the particular case of Everton also will have some notifications and engage as a person of contact for
some grantees (like all members), but because he is not present Nate volunteered to take care of his
grant contacts until he is back. 
Anita will work on the press release to be posted in the media. 
Joel will share the template that includes: the acceptance letter, the W9 form and the final report for
each grantee. 
Rick will generate the letter with the template and Cindy as a treasurer will request the acceptance
letter in order for the grantee to receive the amount awarded. 
Cindy will be stepping down as a treasurer in a few months due to personal occupations and we are
looking for a person to take over her duties as a treasurer. 
Lois reported about the Collins Scholarship. Responses are coming but the need for money is important, 
and we have been asked to request in our own network using the letter template created by Lois. 
Leslie had some pending letters to be sent in this topic and Nate will contact her to follow up on this
issue. 
Next meeting: February 9, 2022, at 7:00 P.M. We will plan future meetings to be held the second
Wednesday of each month. 
Motion to adjourn by Nate and seconded by Cindy at 9:08 pm.
