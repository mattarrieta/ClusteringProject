The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides that an employer may require an employee seeking FMLA leave to care for a
family member with a serious health condition to submit a medical certification issued by the family member’s health care provider. 29
U.S.C. §§ 2613, 2614(c)(3); 29 C.F.R. § 825.305. The employer must give the employee at least 15 calendar days to provide the
certification. If the employee fails to provide complete and sufficient medical certification, his or her FMLA leave request may be
denied. 29 C.F.R. § 825.313. Information about the FMLA may be found on the WHD website at [URL: "http://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla"] www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla. 
SECTION I - EMPLOYER
Either the employee or the employer may complete Section I. While use of this form is optional, this form asks the health care provider
for the information necessary for a complete and sufficient medical certification, which is set out at 29 C.F.R. § 825.306. You may not
ask the employee to provide more information than allowed under the FMLA regulations, 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.306-825.308.
Additionally, you may not request a certification for FMLA leave to bond with a healthy newborn child or a child placed for adoption
or foster care. 
Employers must generally maintain records and documents relating to medical information, medical certifications, recertifications, or
medical histories of employees or employees’ family members created for FMLA purposes as confidential medical records in separate
files/records from the usual personnel files and in accordance with 29 C.F.R. § 1630.14(c)(1), if the Americans with Disabilities Act
applies, and in accordance with 29 C.F.R. § 1635.9, if the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act applies.

SECTION II - EMPLOYEE
Please complete and sign Section II before providing this form to your family member or your family member’s health care provider. 
The FMLA allows an employer to require that you submit a timely, complete, and sufficient medical certification to support a request
for FMLA leave due to the serious health condition of your family member. If requested by your employer, your response is required
to obtain or retain the benefit of the FMLA protections. 29 U.S.C. §§ 2613, 2614(c)(3). You are responsible for making sure the
medical certification is provided to your employer within the time frame requested, which must be at least 15 calendar days. 29
C.F.R. §§ 825.305-825.306. Failure to provide a complete and sufficient medical certification may result in a denial of your FMLA
leave request. 29 C.F.R. § 825.313.

(2) Select the relationship of the family member to you. The family member is your:

Spouse means a husband or wife as defined or recognized in the state where the individual was married, including in a
common law marriage or same-sex marriage. The terms “child” and “parent” include in loco parentis relationships in which
a person assumes the obligations of a parent to a child. An employee may take FMLA leave to care for an individual who
assumed the obligations of a parent to the employee when the employee was a child. An employee may also take FMLA
leave to care for a child for whom the employee has assumed the obligations of a parent. No legal or biological relationship
is necessary.

Definitions of a Serious Health Condition (See 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.113-.115) 
Inpatient Care
• An overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility. 
• Inpatient care includes any period of incapacity or any subsequent treatment in connection with the overnight stay. 
Continuing Treatment by a Health Care Provider (any one or more of the following) 
Incapacity Plus Treatment: A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days, and any subsequent treatment
or period of incapacity relating to the same condition, that also involves either: 
o Two or more in-person visits to a health care provider for treatment within 30 days of the first day of incapacity unless
extenuating circumstances exist. The first visit must be within seven days of the first day of incapacity; or, 
o At least one in-person visit to a health care provider for treatment within seven days of the first day of incapacity, which
results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider. For example, the health
provider might prescribe a course of prescription medication or therapy requiring special equipment. 
Pregnancy: Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care. 
Chronic Conditions: Any period of incapacity due to or treatment for a chronic serious health condition, such as diabetes, asthma, 
migraine headaches. A chronic serious health condition is one which requires visits to a health care provider (or nurse supervised by
the provider) at least twice a year and recurs over an extended period of time. A chronic condition may cause episodic rather than a
continuing period of incapacity. 
Permanent or Long-term Conditions: A period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which
treatment may not be effective, but which requires the continuing supervision of a health care provider, such as Alzheimer’s disease
or the terminal stages of cancer.
Conditions Requiring Multiple Treatments: Restorative surgery after an accident or other injury; or, a condition that would likely
result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days if the patient did not receive the treatment.
