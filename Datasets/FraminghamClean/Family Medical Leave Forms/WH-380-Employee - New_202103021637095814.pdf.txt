The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides that an employer may require an employee seeking FMLA protections
because of a need for leave due to a serious health condition to submit a medical certification issued by the employee’s
health care provider. 29 U.S.C. §§ 2613, 2614(c)(3); 29 C.F.R. § 825.305. The employer must give the employee at least 
15 calendar days to provide the certification. If the employee fails to provide complete and sufficient medical certification, 
his or her FMLA leave request may be denied. 29 C.F.R. § 825.313. Information about the FMLA may be found on the
WHD website at [URL: "http://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla"] www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla.
SECTION I – EMPLOYER
Either the employee or the employer may complete Section I. While use of this form is optional, this form asks the health
care provider for the information necessary for a complete and sufficient medical certification, which is set out at 29 C.F.R. 
§ 825.306. You may not ask the employee to provide more information than allowed under the FMLA regulations,
29 C.F.R. §§ 825.306-825.308. Additionally, you may not request a certification for FMLA leave to bond with a healthy
newborn child or a child placed for adoption or foster care.
Employers must generally maintain records and documents relating to medical information, medical certifications, 
recertifications, or medical histories of employees created for FMLA purposes as confidential medical records in separate
files/records from the usual personnel files and in accordance with 29 C.F.R. § 1630.14(c)(1), if the Americans with
Disabilities Act applies, and in accordance with 29 C.F.R. § 1635.9, if the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act
applies.

SECTION II - HEALTH CARE PROVIDER
Please provide your contact information, complete all relevant parts of this Section, and sign the form. Your patient has
requested leave under the FMLA. The FMLA allows an employer to require that the employee submit a timely, complete, 
and sufficient medical certification to support a request for FMLA leave due to the serious health condition of the employee. 
For FMLA purposes, a “serious health condition” means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that
involves inpatient care or continuing treatment by a health care provider. For more information about the definitions of a
serious health condition under the FMLA, see the chart on page 4. 
You may, but are not required to, provide other appropriate medical facts including symptoms, diagnosis, or any regimen
of continuing treatment such as the use of specialized equipment. Please note that some state or local laws may not allow
disclosure of private medical information about the patient’s serious health condition, such as providing the diagnosis and/or
course of treatment.

Definitions of a Serious Health Condition (See 29 C.F.R. §§ 825.113-.115) 
Inpatient Care
•  An overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility. 
•  Inpatient care includes any period of incapacity or any subsequent treatment in connection with the overnight stay. 
Continuing Treatment by a Health Care Provider (any one or more of the following) 
Incapacity Plus Treatment: A period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days, and any subsequent treatment
or period of incapacity relating to the same condition, that also involves either: 
o Two or more in-person visits to a health care provider for treatment within 30 days of the first day of incapacity unless
extenuating circumstances exist. The first visit must be within seven days of the first day of incapacity; or, 
o At least one in-person visit to a health care provider for treatment within seven days of the first day of incapacity, which
results in a regimen of continuing treatment under the supervision of the health care provider. For example, the health
provider might prescribe a course of prescription medication or therapy requiring special equipment.
Pregnancy: Any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care. 
Chronic Conditions: Any period of incapacity due to or treatment for a chronic serious health condition, such as diabetes, asthma, 
migraine headaches. A chronic serious health condition is one which requires visits to a health care provider (or nurse supervised by
the provider) at least twice a year and recurs over an extended period of time. A chronic condition may cause episodic rather than a
continuing period of incapacity. 
Permanent or Long-term Conditions: A period of incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which
treatment may not be effective, but which requires the continuing supervision of a health care provider, such as Alzheimer’s disease
or the terminal stages of cancer.
Conditions Requiring Multiple Treatments: Restorative surgery after an accident or other injury; or, a condition that would likely
result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days if the patient did not receive the treatment.
