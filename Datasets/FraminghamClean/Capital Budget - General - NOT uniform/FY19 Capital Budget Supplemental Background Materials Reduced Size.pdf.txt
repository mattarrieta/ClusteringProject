Description: 
The following proposal is being presented as a complete Framingham radio communication upgrade. This upgrade will prepare Framingham
for the future by adding repeater sites to resolve dead spots currently reported by the Framingham Police Department. Additionally, the radio
system upgrade will assist with the digital upgrade that is being required by Verizon with their copper to fiber migration. Lastly, the project will
supply the Parks and Recreation Department with an update to their aging VHF radio system.
Comments: 
Justification: 
This project consists of three major components –
1. The radio equipment (quotes from Motorola and their integration partner Voorhees Communication)
2. Fiber optic needs (quotes are provided by Comm-Tract Corp.)
3. Switching, optics and network engineering services (quotes provided by EPlus)
Below is a proposed breakdown by agency and what their requirements are. The unknown costs at this time are Detail costs for the fiber optic
installations which we are responsible for paying, as well as the cost of the necessary leased T1 lines to Staples and the tower on Chrysler
road in Natick. 
Fire Department requirements
Upgrade the repeater at Framingham State and relocate it to the MSP (Mass State Police) tower on Rt9. 
Upgrade the repeater from Metrowest Medical tower and relocate to Doeskin Water tank. 
Install a new receiver at DPW Tower/Western Ave. 
Upgrade the receivers installed at Stapleton School, High School, Staples (9/90 Complex).
Update to new comparator and gateways at Fire Dispatch. 
Police requirements
Upgrade the existing repeater at the MSP tower on RT9. 
Upgrade to new comparator hardware and gateways at Police HQ. 
Upgrade the existing receiver at Stapleton School. 
Upgrade the existing receiver at the High School. 
Current hardware installed at the MSP tower on Nobscot Mountain is ok. 
Current hardware installed at the Chrysler road tower in Natick is ok. 
Install a new receiver at DPW Tower at Western Ave. 
Install a new receiver at Staples (9/90 Complex).
Install a new receiver at BeeBees Water tank on Edmunds Rd. 
DPW requirements
DPW needs a fiber connection from the repeater at the MSP tower on Rt9 to the MSP tower on Nobscot Mountain, since this connection
cannot be made with a microwave connection without a tower at the Indian head water tank. 
Park and Recreation Requirements
Park and Rec is by far the oldest system and cannot be upgraded; they are currently running on a legacy VHF channel that is a non-repeater
system. The recommendation is to move them to a new frequency. Since it will be difficult to get a new frequency for a non-emergency
responder, DPW Water department can apply for a new frequency; they can then be migrated to the new frequency and the existing frequency
can be re-purposed for the Park and Rec department. Park and Rec will need a complete upgrade of the existing subscriber radios (truck
mounted) and a new transmitter as well. Exixting DPW radios will need to be reprogrammed to the new frequency. 
Building Services
No upgrades needed at this time; they currently use the existing emergency band and do very little radio communication. 
School and Transportation
No upgrades needed at this time; they are already running on a digital system and connecting the sites over their fiber optic network. Since
they are not considered a first responder they are allowed to have the radio traffic over a shared medium. 
Fiber and network requirements
Page 2
FY2019 Recommended: Bond $544,321
Fiber will have to be run between the Doeskin Water tank and the MSP tower on Nobscot Mountain; this will tie into the existing municipal fiber
backbone. We will need to install a fiber connection to the MSP equipment shed located at the MSP facility located on Rt9. This will allow us to
run a direct connection between the DPW comparator and the repeater. 
New Verizon leased T1 from Staples to Framingham Police HQ
New Verizon leased T1 from Chrysler Road to Framingham Police HQ
Install fiber from the existing municipal fiber backbone to the electrical room at Stapleton School and the High School. All of the fiber will need
to be connected back to the 3rd floor of Police HQ where the main the switch will be located to connect it all together.

20 Voting Machines - Includes hardware, election reporting software and hardware
Comments: 
Project originally requested and recommended in the FY2018 capital budget - voted down by town
meeting
Justification: 
Purchase Price
The Town Clerk purchased 20 Accu Vote machines from LHS Associates Inc. in July 2006 at $6500
each for a total of $130,000. 
Maintenance 
We have had maintenance contracts with LHS since July 25, 2006. From FY07 – FY10 the annual fee
was $3500. From FY12 – FY17 the annual fee was $4000. The current fee is $4500. 
Expected Useful Life and Replacement Schedule
The Accu Vote machines have an expected useful life of 10-20 years depending on care, average usage
and voter turnout. Manufacturing of the Accu Vote machines stopped in 2007 and parts are becoming
more difficult to locate, LHS estimates that they will be able to maintain support through 2020. Because
2020 is a Presidential Election year with an average voter turnout of 75% (30,000+ voters) I have
requested 20 new voting machines in the FY19 Capital Budget.

Description: 
The existing roadway bridge and sidewalks over Beaver Dam Brook will be replaced, including railings and utilities, completing other recent
rehabilitation and improvements to this roadway corridor.
Comments: 
The Town has a separate state grant for the upstream Beaver Dam Brook Stream Restoration Project, which is adjacent to Mary Dennison
Park, and which is awaiting resolution of contamination issues at the Park. While there is no plan to combine the two projects, largely due to
their separate and different permitting, funding and construction types, the two projects will be coordinated to ensure efficiencies where
possible and to avoid negatively impacting each other. 
Justification: 
The existing bridge was originally built in 1922, repaired in 1951, and is in poor enough condition that it has a posted weight limit that inhibits
full truck usage on this Urban Minor Arterial roadway. A majority of the cost will be paid from an approved state Small Bridge grant.

Description: 
The culvert carrying Landham Brook under Edgell Road, which is a couple hundred feet north of Edmands Road and Water Street, is in major
disrepair. It is a skewed 6 feet wide by 3.5 feet tall by 100 feet long cast-in-place concrete box, with about 1 foot thickness, and about 1 foot of
typical water depth. Rehab will include injection of grout at the upper corners of the culvert box, shallow and deep patching of the roof and
wingwalls, full-depth concrete replacement of the west end roof, a new curb, and erosion protection. It is not anticipated that reinforcement
needs to be replaced or added. 
Comments: 
This is near to, and related to recent and anticipated Nobscot redevelopment and intersection improvements. 
Justification: 
There is significant concrete deterioration, with exposed rebar and rust on the culvert roof (and underside of the roadway), and widespread
spalling and delamination at the wingwalls that cover up to 75% of the exposed surface areas. Proactive rehabilitation will be less costly and
less disruptive than replacement, particularly if that work was needed during or following an emergency (including failure).

Re: FY-2019 Capital Improvements
Edgell Rd Culvert Rehabilitation 
Dear Mr. Johnson, 
The culvert conveying Landham Brook under Edgell Road is located approximate 600 feet north of the Edgell Road
at Edmands Rd/Water St intersection and is need of repair. The culvert is a skewed 6 feet wide by 4.5 feet tall by 75
feet long cast-in-place concrete box, with about 1 foot thickness, and about 1 foot of typical water depth. The
proposed rehabilitation will include shallow and deep patching of the roof and wingwalls including the addition of
steel reinforcement, full-depth concrete replacement of the west end headwall and roof slab including replacement
of corroded steel reinforcement, new granite curb, new guardrail, additional closed drainage, and loam & seed for
restoration. 
There is significant concrete deterioration, with exposed rebar and rust on the culvert roof (and underside of the
roadway), and widespread spalling and delamination at the wingwalls that cover up to 75% of the exposed surface
areas due to the stormwater runoff directly from Edgell Road. Proactive rehabilitation will be less costly and less
disruptive than replacement, particularly if that work was needed during or following an emergency (including
failure).
The total costs associated with the design and construction of the Edgell Road over Landham Brook is estimated to
be $310,000. 
If you have any questions, or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Description: 
The Annual Road Program utilizes several different maintenance applications to ensure the appropriate road condition. 
Roadway Resurfacing includes mill and Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) overlay, which is the process of grinding off the top layer of existing asphalt
pavement by means of a large milling machine and replacing this layer with at least two layers of a new HMA riding surface. A leveling course
may be applied prior to the final riding surface to resolve various roadway defects, ensure proper drainage, and provide adequate rideability
throughout the duration of the project. Drainage improvements are made if needed before paving. Curbing is re-laid or replaced if they are in
poor condition or reset for adequate reveal. Sidewalk reconstruction includes ADA handicap ramp upgrades. Signage and traffic marking are
upgraded. Tentative roads scheduled for roadway resurfacing are Fenwick Street, Wickford Road, Sturgis Road, Normandy Road, Sanger
Street, Thompson Street, William Welch Way and Speen Street. 
The Department also utilizes several different Roadway Surface Treatment applications including: 
Rubber chip seal is typically applied to neighborhood roads with low to moderate volume traffic volumes. The treatment is used to provide a
flexible, waterproof wearing surface that seals the existing pavement and is highly resistant to cracking. Installation includes a HMA shim
course to redefine the profile of the road, provide structural stability, and improve rideability. All utility castings are raised to finish grade, 
driveway aprons are adjusted as needed, and a rubber chip seal topcoat is applied. Signage and traffic markings are upgraded. The annual
road program is scheduled to include: Ridgefield Drive, Leonard Road, Lohnes Road, Blackthorn Road, Bantry Road, Rosslare Road, Tara
Road, Poskus Road, Hastings Street, Sunset Drive, Pitt Road, Cavanaugh Road, Fairbanks Road, Fairbanks Way, Highland Court, Murray
Road, Magnolia Street, Michaud Drive, Childs Circle, Woodside Cottage Way, Gil Leonard Road, Wyndstone Way, Highgate Road, and
Crestwood Drive. 
Rubber chip seal can also be used in conjunction with other roadway treatments as a Stress Absorbing Membrane Interlayer (SAMI). The
SAMI seals the roadway and extends its service life. Bonded Wearing Course (or Novachip) can be applied after a SAMI and includes a thin
layer of a polymer modified asphalt emulsion sprayed onto the road surface followed immediately by an overlay of HMA. Castings are raised to
grade and traffic markings are restored. Tentative roads scheduled for this surface treatment application are Salem End Road (partial),
Parmentor Road, and Nixon Road. 
Mill and fill operations are also performed by the Department in conjunction with specialized contracted equipment to address surface defects. 
Mill and fill can be used as a stand-alone roadway maintenance method or can be used in preparation for surface treatment products.
Justification: 
Without substantial ongoing improvements, the roadway system will deteriorate rapidly, and cost more to raise back up to a State of Good
Repair.

This Urban Collector roadway bridge will be repaired, as will the sidewalks (that are now closed), water, sewer force main, gas pipes and
telephone conduit. 
Comments: 
A September 2017 letter from the state underscores known deficiencies and urgency for permanent repairs, with the potential that continuing
deterioration will result in load restrictions and/or closure in coming years.
Justification: 
This project was deferred from the FY2018 request. The existing 30-foot span bridge was constructed over the Stearns Reservoir in 1870, and
the superstructure was reconstructed in 1927, and is now in a very deteriorated condition. Interim repairs were performed in June 2017 (fill
holes in the deck), and in September 2017 the state directed Framingham to correct numerous deficiencies with temporary measures (fences
and barriers) and permanent repairs. New floor beams, sidewalk, bridge rail and guardrail will be provided, with some additional concrete
repairs performed, and the existing water line will receive new insulation. This work will extend the existing bridge life, and the need for major
or total reconstruction that will be much more costly and disruptive.

Dear Matt, 
Reference: Fountain Street Roadway Improvements – FY19 Funding Request
Stantec has prepared this letter to summarize anticipated funding needs in FY2019 for final design
associated with roadway improvements on Fountain Street. This phase of the project will complete
the design of new sidewalks, improved intersection geometry/installation of permanent traffic
signal at Dudley Road, roadway rehabilitation, streetscape enhancements, and
drainage/stormwater improvements currently developed to the 60% design stage. This phase of
the project will also include some remaining sewer lining to be completed following water main
replacement and initial sewer main/drain pipe lining work that is ongoing in FY2018. Construction
of these roadway improvements and related utility work, including a funding request, is
anticipated for FY2020. 
This corridor has conflicting and inadequate transportation modes, particularly for students, other
pedestrians and the disabled traveling to/from Keefe Tech and Loring Arena within the corrdior, as
well as buried drainage, sewer and water pipes in need of repair or replacement, and high
velocity and poor quality runoff into the southwest corner of Farm Pond. Results of the completed
project will include increased safety and mobility for al transportation modes, improved water
quality and other natural resources at Farm Pond, and a more attractive corridor. 
Town infrastructure assets addressed under this project include: 
•  Installation of permanent traffic signal
•  2,650 LF roadway rehabilitation
•  3,650 LF new sidewalk
•  1,500 LF new drain pipe and channel (an additional 1,600 LF lined in prior “Utilities” phase)
•  1,700 LF sewer main to be lined (2,400 LF lined in prior phase)
•  (3,500 LF water main replaced in prior phase)
This letter confirms the need for $210,000 in funding for the Fountain Street Roadway Improvements
project in FY2019.

Service performance, pride of service and community support are all emphasized by DPW, with vehicle cleanliness an important expression of
those, and a responsibility of DPW staff. 
Justification: 
All of the existing vehicles being replaced will have exceeded 10 years in service when replaced (and sold), and nearly all are near to or over
100,000 miles or run-hours equivalent. Industry and Framingham DPW experience indicates that above those thresholds maintenance
increases substantially to assure service reliability, as do major repairs, none of which provide a return on investment, and they are not
sustainable with the current DPW facility and staffing. In addition to daily service for the various Divisions, they all are used for the
Department’s snow and ice management program, with many also used to respond to community events and emergencies. Snow plowing is
particularly destructive to vehicles.

Description: 
This funding will provide for the continuing investigation and evaluation of the Dudley Road Landfill that will assess the extent of environmental
impacts and formal closure needs. 
Comments: 
Formal landfill closure is a multistep process, and a result could require extensive construction and relocation of the current yard waste
composting facility. 
Justification: 
There is a continuing compliance assurance need for the landfill per the MassDEP Solid Waste Regulations. Failure to close the landfill in
accordance with those Regulations could subject the City to fines, potentially dating back to cessation of landfill operations.

Description: 
This project will create an accessible, built-in audio-visual system in the Community Room of the McAuliffe Branch Library, for use by both
library-sponsored programs and outside groups. It will consist of a ceiling-mounted projector, Blu-ray player, wired and wireless microphones, 
speakers, assistive listening devices, control systems, and other A/V equipment needed to create a cohesive, easy-to-operate system. The
project also includes a projection screen for the McAuliffe Library Craft Room to allow A/V presentations in that meeting room, and portable
speakers for outdoor events at the branch. Some modest physical changes to the Community Room will be required, which will require the
assistance of Building Services. 
Comments: 
When the branch library was built in 2016, it had no budget for audiovisual equipment other than a projection screen. The Community Room
has proven to be an enormously popular location for meetings of all types, but the absence of a built-in A/V installation has proven quite
troublesome. At the beginning of FY2019, the building will have been open for 29 months; it is time to fill this gap. 
*Potential to use remaining funding from McAuliffe Library project - reduce appropriation request once confirmed
The amount required for this project is $79,932, of which $9,000 will come from MBLC State Aid, and $70,932 would be sourced from the
General Fund/borrowing. 
Justification: 
Completing this project will greatly improve the usability of the McAuliffe Branch’s Community Room, as envisioned when the room was
originally architected, by adding a high-quality, permanent, reliable audio-visual installation. Doing so will save staff time and avert disruption of
services by obviating the need to manually configure and troubleshoot our existing ad-hoc, temperamental, A/V equipment. It will allow both
staff and patrons to more easily run and enjoy presentations, performances, and other events, without the difficulty, limitations, and
unpredictability associated with our temporary solution. 
To provide patrons and staff with an interim method of hosting presentations, showing films, and amplifying audio, the library assembled an
inexpensive, mobile “projector cart.” This system was intended only as a stopgap, pending a permanent A/V installation. We estimate that the
cart has been used for library-sponsored programs and outside group events approximately 100 times in the first 10 months of CY2017, 
including Town-sponsored training programs. However, there have been numerous, serious problems with this temporary solution. 
The complete set of problems is detailed in the attached documentation (McAuliffe Community Room AV Capital Project Request), but in brief: 
The cart needs manual setup and breakdown by staff members, the public makes improper modifications to the cart configuration, technical
problems are common, equipment has gotten lost, the cart consumes valuable floor space, and the wiring creates a tripping hazard. Most of
these issues routinely threaten to derail important events, and interfere with normal library operations as staff must tend to unpredictable A/V
issues. 
In addition to the problems with the projector cart and associated logistics, there are also no built-in speakers in the Community Room. Our
basic assistive listening system needs to be augmented. And we have limited wireless microphone support, which affects our ability to both
host events with multiple performers, and the ability of hearing-impaired attendees to hear presenters/performers who might otherwise be fitted
with microphones solely for assistive reasons. 
Beyond the Community Room, events are also held in the Craft Room, but we lack a projection screen in that room. We also hold outdoor
events at the McAuliffe Branch, and have been frequently borrowing luggable, battery-powered speakers from the Main Library, which is
inefficient, so the Branch needs its own dedicated set of portable speakers.

WARRANTY
All equipment contained in this system includes and is governed by a manufacturer's warranty. All manufacturers’ warranties
are honored and serviced. HB warrants all system installations for six months. Standard Warranty includes the workmanship
and labor provided by HB Communications and all of its subcontractors covering the scope of work included in this proposal.
During the six months, HB will provide all necessary labor required to repair or replace any defects in workmanship, cabling,
connectors, equipment mounting, software and all other “non-equipment” related systems installed under the contract.
System warranty shall include the coverage of all equipment, specific to each manufacturer's warranty for each product
included in the contract.
Service & Response Times
Scheduled service shall be performed for corrective service and emergency maintenance and then only during normal
business hours during normal business days. Normal business hours shall be from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM and normal business
days Monday through Friday, national and local holidays accepted.
HB makes every effort possible to respond to customers’ needs as quickly as possible. Response time from a customer’s
initial call for emergency service is usually within two (2) hours for telephone response and twenty-four (24) hours for on-site
service.
Exclusions
Unless otherwise covered under a manufacturer’s warranty, the remedy of failure caused by the following is excluded from
the Warranty: normal use and wear, hazardous environmental conditions, continual use in excess of manufacturer’s
recommendations and alteration of the system or any of its component parts.
Customer shall be responsible for the costs of any repair or replacement parts resulting from exposure of the equipment to
abnormal acts or operating conditions over and above expected wear and tear such as fire, storm, lightning, theft, physical
abuse, mishandling, vandalism, acts of God, or other causes beyond the reasonable control of HB, for use of a product in an
application other than what the unit was intended for or attempted repairs by anyone other than HB’s personnel or
designated agent.
Such repair or replacement, when requested by the Customer, will be done by HB and billed to the Customer at the published
rate, including parts and labor. HB's standard field service rate is $140.00 per hour during normal business hours, portal to
portal, with a minimum charge of four hours.
Warranty Period
The warranty period shall begin when the client receives beneficial use of the system, or at final acceptance, whichever comes
first.
Extended Warranty and Warranty Options
Customer may choose to extend the duration of the Standard Warranty, improve on Service & Response Time commitments,
or request that Preventive Maintenance be performed during the warranty period. These options can be provided at an
additional charge and include:
•  Extend duration of Standard Warranty
•  Response Time Commitment of Next Business Day
•  Response Time Commitment of Four (4) Hour response to Critical Incident
•  Preventive Maintenance Visits – One or more preventive service visits during the Warranty Term.
HB P-209966  Page 9  November 8, 2017
Page 57
McAuliffe Library
Community Room Presentation Upgrades
SERVICE AGREEMENTS
Upon expiration of the Standard Warranty period, future service by HB is provided under Time and Materials terms and fees
applicable at that time unless Customer engages in a Service Agreement. The benefit of HB Service Agreements is that HB
will continue to warrant the workmanship and labor, provide Service Level Agreement (SLA) response time commitments,
and include an agreed upon number of Preventive Maintenance Visits during the term of the contract.
Service Level Agreements (SLA)
HB offers three maintenance agreements based on varying degrees of service and response times. Of course, plans can be
customized to individual circumstances and needs. Agreements are typically entered into for one to three years. As an
example, a typical Silver Service Agreement with average coverage for the equipment contained in this proposal would be
priced at $3,147.00 for a single year.
Strategic Staffing Services
Under an HB Staffing Agreement, HB assigns each Customer one or more HB Audio Visual Support Specialist (AVSS) to assist
in the use and operation of the systems at the customer facility. HB Staff Technicians are an extension of our client’s staff
and report daily to their assigned client site. They are typically responsible for ongoing support for the use and functionality
of audio and video technology, providing support for users, meeting and events, and may be involved in the planning and
implementation of change or new installation of AV, Video, or related solutions at the client location.

ROOM READINESS
The following describes the physical conditions we require at the site in order to bring equipment into the designated area.
These “room ready” conditions have been developed to insure proper site conditions that pose no compromise to the proper
operation and performance of the equipment. Further, they will allow our installers to work at maximum efficiency insuring
timely completion. Where reasonable or possible:
Conduit
Prior to commencement of work by HB, Customer will assure that adequate cable pathways or conduit are furnished. All
conduit may not exceed 40% fill per NEC standards. If HB discovers insufficient conduit capacity, Customer will remedy
without penalty or cost to HB.
120-Volt Power
All permanent 120-volt AC power and work is the responsibility of the Customer and must be in place. This includes the
electrical connection to any electric projection screens. All receptacles must be properly grounded per NEC requirements,
and all circuits must be of sufficient capacity to provide full turn on power to all system racks without tripping breakers.
Location of all 120-volt receptacles must be within reasonable and logical proximity of equipment.
Equipment Delivery
Prior to the delivery of all equipment and electronics, all spaces are “broom-clean” and the site is free of dust and dirt. All
construction, including drywall, painting, ceilings, flooring and millwork is complete. If, at the discretion of the Customer,
equipment is brought to site before it is clean, functionality, longevity and warranties may be compromised.
OSHA Requirements
Prior to commencement of work by HB, the job site must meet OSHA requirements for a healthful workplace. Appropriate
safety policies should be set, maintained, and enforced by all work forces.

CLOSEOUT PROCESS
In order to ensure that the client will be satisfied with a complete project, HB has developed a Closeout Process. This process
ties up any loose ends ensuring that the project is complete.
Final Testing
HB will complete final termination, testing and “de-bugging” of installed systems.
Documentation
All documents referring to the project including spec sheets are handed over to the client for their records.
Equipment Manuals
HB will provide sets of equipment manuals for each piece of equipment in your project.
These manuals can be hardcopy and available on CD.
Training
After equipment has been installed, HB will train the client end users on how to use the systems. Training is scheduled based
on the customer’s schedule.
Installation Sign-Off
HB utilizes an “Installation Sign-Off” form to signify project completion.
This document provides a mechanism for the Owner to acknowledge completion or receipt of beneficial use of the system or
to identify performance exceptions to the system.
HB is able to remedy such exceptions on a timely basis and then identifies the beginning of the warranty period.
Portfolio Consideration
Each client project is important to us and many showcase our quality of work. After project completion, with client’s approval,
HB will schedule a photo shoot featuring the recently installed technology.
In some instances, a formal case study will also be written and posted online or appear in HB marketing materials.
All photos will be available to the client upon request.

Christa McAuliffe Branch Library Community Room A/V Project
Capital Budget Proposal FY2019
11/13/2017 
Mark Contois; Alan Mandel
This is a Capital project proposal to install a permanent audio-visual system in the Community Room of
the Christa McAuliffe Branch Library. The amount required for this project is $79,932, of which $9,000
will come from MBLC State Aid, and $70,932 would be sourced from the General Fund/borrowing. 
Overview
When the branch library was built in 2016, it had no budget for audiovisual equipment other
than a projection screen. The Community Room has proven to be an enormously popular
location for meetings of all types, but the absence of a built-in A/V installation has proven quite
troublesome. At the beginning of FY2019, the building will have been open for 29 months; it is
time to fill this gap. 
To provide patrons and staff with an interim method of hosting presentations, showing films, 
and amplifying audio, the library assembled a mobile “projector cart.” This cart contains a video
projector, laptop, Blu-ray player, and speakers. This has been supplemented with various cables, 
adapters, microphones and other audio-related devices, as well as a basic assistive listening
system for hearing-impaired attendees. 
The Community Room is heavily-used for A/V purposes; we estimate that approximately 100
such programs1 (either library-sponsored or for outside groups) have taken place in the first 10
months of 2017. Town/City-sponsored training sessions have also taken place in the Community
Room. 
The McAuliffe projector cart was intended only as a temporary solution pending the installation
of a robust built-in A/V system. The most notable problems with the existing ad-hoc projector
cart system include: 
  The cart needs to be set up for each event, and stowed securely afterwards. Each step
consumes staff time and requires expertise.
  In some cases, the A/V setup is not completely intuitive, so time and care are required.
Not all staff have adequate training to set up the cart. Last-second technical problems
are common, and suddenly pulling staff from other duties is disruptive, and creates
ripple effects elsewhere in the library, ultimately inconveniencing library patrons and
detracting from customer service.

sponsored events and outside groups.

Page 61
This is particularly troublesome when events take place early or late, when the few staff
members present must interrupt both routine and time-critical tasks to tend to
unexpected A/V issues. 
  The cart must be formally and carefully checked in and checked out to outside groups to
foster accountability. This not only takes time, but also creates significant logistical
hurdles. When programs end in the evening, the library is typically lightly staffed, often
with substitute personnel who have little or no A/V experience. And when an outside
group needs to begin their meeting before the library opens, or finishes their meeting
after closing time, there is no staff at all to instruct, assist, or monitor usage of the cart.
  The cart has many connections and parts of it are fragile. Patrons or staff who are
unfamiliar with it can easily misconfigure the equipment, or even damage it. This has
been a particular challenge when outside groups start their meetings early (prior to staff
arrival) and take the opportunity to reconfigure the cart.
  The cart must be placed and wired near the center of the room, which subjects it to
jostling, poses a tripping hazard, consumes floor space where the audience sits, and
creates visual and audible distractions.
  With so much hardware involved, parts can go missing (and have done so). When this
happens, or when someone has improperly modified the equipment, the latent
problems may not become obvious until a future date … at which point the absence of a
necessary device, or the expertise to work around a misconfiguration, could completely
torpedo a planned event.
  As the location of the cart is fluid, and as the projector is available for patrons to fiddle
with its settings, there is no way to ensure a consistent, high-quality projected image.
  There is no built-in sound recording, amplification, or projection system for voice,
musical performances, or films. The audio setup is ad hoc and not of high quality. The
speakers on the projector cart may be too loud for attendees sitting next to the cart,
and too quiet for patrons in other areas of the room.
  The assistive listening equipment is limited, and should be expanded to support more
users.
  We would like to be able to support A/V sessions in multiple meeting rooms at once, but
the cart can only be in one location at a time. The Children’s Craft Room is a prime
target for the cart, however, there is no projection screen in that room.
The McAuliffe branch also needs a set of robust, battery-powered portable speakers suitable for
on-location or outdoor events. The Main Library has such a set, but a second set is needed for
the branch. 
Page 2 of 4 
Page 62
Process
The requirements for the proposed system were derived through discussions with McAuliffe
staff, in consultation with HB Communications, and were informed by our extensive experience
supporting A/V-based programs in the Community Room, as well as numerous events using the
built-in A/V system in the Main Library’s Costin Room. 
Proposed features
To substantially mitigate the weaknesses enumerated above, we propose a professionally-
installed A/V system with the following guiding principles: 
  Staff should be able to use all equipment effectively, with modest training and minimal
risk of loss or damage.
  One staff member should be able to set up and initiate a staff-sponsored event with
minimal effort, and allow routine events to proceed with minimal or no further action.
  The public should to be able to use many of the room’s capabilities without staff
oversight or substantial risk of theft/damage. These capabilities include showing disc-
based videos, displaying and using a computer whose image is projected on the screen,
displaying the contents of mobile devices, playing audio, and using at least 2 wired
microphones.
The proposed system, as supported by the analysis and associated quote from HB
Communications, Inc., would incorporate the following key features: 
  Ceiling-mounted projector
  Overhead “PA System” speakers and surround-sound system
  A publicly-accessible Blu-ray/DVD player
  Always-available, secure, built-in PC which is usable by the public via remote
keyboard/mouse/USB
  Wall control panel for input selection, volume control, player controls
  Wall connections for various video and audio sources
  Improved microphone selection and audio mixing capabilities
  Expanded assistive listening options
  Improved security and protection for most equipment
  Better expandability 
Page 3 of 4 
Page 63
  Built-in projection screen in the Children’s Craft Room
  Set of battery-powered, portable speakers sufficient for events elsewhere in the library,
and at outdoor events
Cost/Funding
A detailed quote from HB Communications based on the OFF40 State Contract, dated November
8, 2017, is provided under separate cover. The cost for their proposed A/V installation that
meets the requirements above is $79,932. This quote includes procurement, design, assembly, 
testing, most installation (see Other Notes below), shipping, staff training, and a 6-month
warranty. 
We are applying $9,000 from the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners State Aid
toward this capital project. 
Other Notes
The existing projector cart will continue to be used even after the implementation of the
proposed Capital project. We expect it be used elsewhere in the building, such as the Children’s
Craft Room. And it will serve as a backup for the new built-in A/V system, when the latter is out
of service. 
Completing the installation may require physical changes to the McAuliffe Community Room, 
and are not included in the attached quotes, as some or all of this work may be performed by
City personnel. Anticipated changes are: 
1. 120V power runs to various locations for A/V equipment (e.g., projector, closet, wall
panel(s)).
2. Construction of an enclosure within a wall for the publicly-accessible Blu-ray player.
3. Creating an opening in the wall between the interior of the two closets in the
Community Room for cable pass-through.
4. One of the following, to permit A/V connector wiring to be installed in a location that
works well with screen and lectern placement:
a. Knee wall removal and reconstruction; or
b. Installation of attractive wire molding.

Description: 
In order to comply with current ADA standards, create compatibility with our new RFID technology, and streamline service, the Main Library
seeks to replace the current main floor circulation desk. The current desk dates from 1979, before the Americans with Disabilities Act became
law in 1990 and before computers were used to circulate library material. This desk has been used eight to twelve hours a day for the past forty
years. 
Comments: 
Replacing the 40 year old circulation desk is critical to meeting the current standards for library service, especially as it pertains to computer
centered workstations and emerging technologies. Furthermore, a new desk will result in a reduction of service points, allowing staff to pursue
other activities and duties necessary in operating the modern library. Also, and most critical, the new desk ensure we comply with the
Americans with Disabilities Act and provide appropriate access to our patrons with disabilities. 
The amount required for this project is $66,038.00, of which $7,000 will come from MBLC State Aid, and $59,038.00 would be sourced from
the General Fund/borrowing. 
Justification: 
Primary reasons for replacement are: 
-Accessibility (currently non-compliant with ADA standards) 
-Reduction of service points from 3 to 2 made possible because of new desk configuration 
-New desk designed and built to accept RFID Technology 
-New desk designed to improve patron and staff workflow with RFID security gates
-New desk designed to work in unison with Self-check stations 
-Security enhancements will be possible with new desk design: 
˜  *Camera access can embedded into new desk
˜  *Cash register can be made less visible and vulnerable
˜  *Lines of sight can be improved to both entrances
-New desk configuration allows for the installation of ergonomic features such as cushioned flooring for staff and appropriate counter heights
-New desk configuration with new book trucks will allow for more efficient workflow such as returns, sorting and re-shelving of library material
-Marketing: Our new desk will have an illuminated display case built into the front to securely market our Library of Things--Roku, Google
Home, Amazon Echo, Wifi Hotspots, and portable battery pack chargers, etc. 
-The existing desk has served Framingham well for over 40 years and has seen approximately 60 million transactions come across the surface
of the desk. The desk is understandably worn (the original color of the laminate is unidentifiable in several places). This, coupled with the
rationale above, including the imminent installation of RFID technology makes now the perfect time for replacement.

95% Final Park Project Design and Environmental Testing/Remediation Design
Comments: 
2019 
Main 2019 
Department Request
Yes 
Justification: 
The City of Framingham has been working in cooperation with the state environmental agency (Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection, MassDEP) and former property owner, Avery Dennison Corporation of Pasadena, CA, formerly known as Dennison Manufacturing
Company, to conduct required testing at the park and to create an appropriate remediation plan to address the environmental concerns at Mary
Dennison Park. Parks & Recreation has been limited in moving forward on the new park redesign, since the re-design of the park must be
developed in conjunction with an appropriate environmental remediation plan. We anticipate that the remediation plan could be developed
during the next fiscal year, although an in-depth (100%) design will likely take longer. Also, some additional testing of the park’s adjacent
properties is required and is currently in process. Therefore, this appropriation request includes funding for both park re-design steps as well
as further testing and environmental cleanup planning. 
Prior Town Meeting appropriations have allowed us to complete the environmental testing of the park property itself and to perform short-term
remediation, primarily of the eastern playground area; the rest of the park has remained open for its existing uses. This remediation allowed the
Parks Department to temporarily re-open the eastern playground for public use until the long-term remediation plan is implemented. 
Our Department has conducted public meetings to assist in defining and incorporating the neighborhood’s vision for a re-designed park as well
as regular project updates to the community. In this next phase, the preliminary design/design development plans for the park will be
developed along with the environmental remediation design plans. 
The FY 2019 Capital funding request for this project will enable the City to begin the 95% Final Project Park and Environmental Feasibility
Study/Remediation Design. The identified funding request and projected timeline is a budget estimate based on current available information
and is subject to change as additional information becomes available.

Description: 
This project is a continuation of a multi-phase improvement plan for Butterworth Park. Completion of this project will continue to accomplish
important identified improvements to this valued neighborhood Park. 
Comments: 
Justification: 
The present phase of the Butterworth Park improvement plan consists of
relocation of the current full basketball court to a more appropriate location
within the facility. In a prior improvement phase, the Parks Department received
funding for the removal of a failing concrete bleacher structure that provided
spectator seating along the baseball diamond. Once this structure was removed
the basketball court was exposed to a potential foul ball hazard. To mitigate this
concern, the Parks Department is proposing relocation of the full sized court and
returning the current location back to green space. 
The new court will be relocated parallel to Grant Street in the current location of the aging half-court basketball court. This will require grinding
and removal of the current full sized basketball court. This area will then be returned to green space, further beautifying the park and adding
an additional location for families to recreate. The half-court will then be removed and a new full sized court will be constructed in its place. 
Finally, an accessible pathway will be built leading to the new court from the existing interior park pathway. 
This improvement project is Phase VI in the Butterworth Park improvement plan. Prior Park Improvement Phases include: 
• Phase I – Construction of a new internal parking lot and formalization of perimeter parking along Arthur Street.
• Phase II – Installation of lighting at tennis courts.
• Phase III – Removal of old concrete bleacher structure and installation of new ADA seating at baseball diamond.
• Phase IV – Installation of accessible interior park pathway and reconfiguration of Grant Street entrance to park.
• Phase V – Installation of shade shelter at playground (ongoing)
The Parks Department’s mission statement it “to create recreation opportunities, preserve open space, manage public athletic fields and parks, 
and administer recreation programs and facilities for the varied population of Framingham.” Neighborhood parks are essential in providing safe
space for the community to gather. These proposed improvements to Butterworth Park continue our effort to further our mission statement as
well as to provide a neighborhood park that residents can be proud of. 
In an effort to continue in our mission to provide a safe and well maintained park that the Butterworth neighborhood can feel proud of, the
Division of Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs respectfully requests funding for this Phase VI park improvement request.

Description: 
These funds will be used to purchase a F350 4x4 Crew Cab Pickup Truck to replace a 2001 Ford F350 4x4 Regular Cab Pickup Truck with
79,723 miles, equating to 119,585 engine miles. 
Comments: 
Justification: 
The Parks Maintenance Department has a limited amount of vehicles within its fleet to support the operational demands. This vehicle, listed
within our fleet as Truck 3, is a F350 4x4 Crew Cab Pickup truck used to transport staff on a limited basis. Due to its current condition, this
vehicle is no longer used to transport equipment and has greatly decreased its capabilities to serve within the fleet. 
In the past calendar year, this vehicle has undergone numerous repairs in order to pass State Inspection. These repairs have included the
replacement of ball joints, and replacement of the shifter cable. Over the past year, Truck 3 has sustained additional rust damage that has
required minor body work repairs in an effort to stabilize the vehicle for usage. These repairs have included work to the bed mounts, wheel
wells, and front bumper. Due to the age and continued (while limited), usage of Truck 3, we anticipate this vehicle will continue to deteriorate, 
further limiting its usefulness. In addition, the current condition and continued deterioration of Truck 3 prevent the vehicle from passing State
vehicle inspection next year. Those repairs include, but are not limited to: 
• Replacement of both sets of rear springs;
• Replacement of rusted, leaking oil pan and rear main engine seal that requires removal of the engine and transmission;
• Replacement of shocks;
• Replacement of rotted break lines;
After 17 years of operational service, the overall physical and mechanical condition of the vehicle is significantly degraded, requiring
replacement.

Memorandum
From the desk of Donald Capen
November 4, 2017
RE: Capital Budget Vehicle Replacement — 2001 Ford F350 4x4 Regular Cab Pickup
C~11'IS,
As requested, the following is a description of the current issues with the 2001 Ford F350 4x4 Regular
Cab Pickup. Currently, this vehicle has 79,723 miles on the odometer.
Due to its current condition, this vehicle is no longer used to transport equipment and has greatly
decreased its capabilities to serve within the fleet. Current issues requiring attention, labor and
expense are: 
• Replacement of both sets of rear springs;
• Replacement of rusted, leaking oil pan and rear main engine seal that
requires removal of the engine and transmission;
Replacement of shocks;
• Replacement of rotted break lines;
In the past calendar year, this vehicle has undergone numerous repairs in order to pass State
Inspection. These repairs have included the replacement of ball joints, and replacement of the
shifter cable. Over the past year, Truck 3 has sustained additional rust damage that has required
minor body work repairs in an effort to stabilize the vehicle for usage.
After 17 years ofoperationalservice, the overall physical and mechanical condition ofthe vehicle is
significantly degraded. Based on an overall assessment of the vehicle, I believe it has reached its
useful life expectancy and would recommend replacement.

Description: 
Technology Upgrades Throughout the District Tech
Comments: 
The Office of Technology is requesting funds to continue to move forward with the District Technology Plan. The goal of the plan is to provide
a strong and dependable infrastructure as well as appropriate devices to support an advanced learning environment for the 21st century
student and educator. The Office’s intent is to lead and collaborate with students, staff and district administration to meet both instructional
and administrative goals of teaching and learning district-wide. These funds are also being requested to refresh aged staff laptops over 4
years old, and upgrade to a high-performance network using current technology.
Justification: 
Capital Technology - Justification
The Office of Technology is responsible for providing a technical foundation and vision to support the advance learning environment of the
21st century student and educator. The intent is to lead and collaborate across the spectrum of students, staff and district administration to
meet both instructional and administrative goals of teaching and learning district-wide. Framingham Public Schools will continue to invest in
technology throughout the district with a focus on student and staff needs. 
Chromebooks
The Framingham Public School district has made an initial investment in the use of Google based Chromebook in the classroom. 
Chromebooks are low cost keyboard based solution for putting technology into the student’s hands and integrates directly with the district’s
investment in Google Apps for Education. The Google WebApp store offers a wide selection of free and paid-for apps spanning educational
and business categories. The district's goal is to ensure that every student has access to technology and online resources. This request is to
support the continued deployment and refresh of devices in the classroom in an equitable manner. Devices will be distributed based on a
student ratio and the school's commitment to enhancing their digital curriculum. 
Staff Laptops
The Framingham Public School District must continue to invest in tools to assist staff within the classroom and learning environment. The
average lifespan of these devices, stated by the vendor is 5 years. The district has distributed devices starting in 2010 but has not established
a replenishment process to replace the depreciated devices. The Office of Technology has developed a schedule to replace 25% of the staff
laptops each year over the next 4 years. The investment to staff devices should be viewed as a re-occurring cost. 
Classroom Projectors
Each classroom the district has been equipped over the years with technology to support the learning environment. LCD projectors are useful
in presenting and sharing in a group environment. Current LCD projectors are aging and many within the district are reaching 10 years. This
investment is intended to replenish 15% of the aged staff/classroom tools. 
School Library Technology Upgrades
The Framingham Public School District continues to develop and support the Framingham Public Schools Library program. The impact an
effective 21st century library can have on students, teachers, and administrators is unquestionable. A well-functioning library is the
nexus of the school, supporting teachers and positively impacting student learning, information literacy, and achievement; and helps promote
positive digital citizenship. Each School Library has requested upgrades in the technology needed to create and operate an environment
focused on research. This investment will continue to provide seamless access to digital resources, integrate technology into the curriculum of
the Framingham Public School district, and to assist the learning community through efficient processes and training.

Although we await the results of the Fuller School MSBA Feasibility Study to determine whether the Farley Building will be prepared for swing
space or a temporary home for staff and students’ while the new Fuller is being constructed, we do know that all of the other occupants, i.e. 
Buildings and Grounds, Parent Information Center, Town Board of Health Department, Adult ESL, Truant Officer and ECA (Early Childhood
Assessment) will require a new home. It remains to be seen where those offices will relocate too. 
We anticipate that the Farley Building will become a mixed use building and will house some form of education, whether it be Mass Bay
Community College or FPS, (Adult ESL or something else) is still to be determined but we know that will need to house Maintenance, 
Administrative and some education. 
Justification: 
The Fuller School houses currently the Buildings and Grounds Department comprised of the Buildings and Grounds office and maintenance
shop as well as vehicle and equipment storage. 
The Department occupies approximately 30,000 square feet. We have preparations and designs of the Farley Building in the existing pool and
locker room area and plan to relocate and house the B &G Departments at Farley in that area of the building. A new roof and exterior siding as
well as demolition and infill of the existing pool were done last year and an overhead door was installed in preparation of converting the pool to a
maintenance garage and shop for Buildings and Grounds. 
The next phase of work will include demolition of existing C.M.U. walls, and plaster ceilings in the locker room areas – reframing new partitions
per the architects plan, purchasing and installing a new HVAC unit, fire alarm, electrical, plumbing and mechanical systems and installation of
new concrete floors are where the swimming pool was.

Comments: 
The School Department has implemented increased security measures throughout the District and is mindful of past and ongoing school
related security events across our nation. The District greatly expanded its security in the spring of 2013. This request for funding will further
support and enhance security measures for all our schools. 
Justification: 
For the FY19 school year, the District is requesting funding for the following: 
The Walsh school is a 26 camera add, based on the walkthrough with the principal. Most of these cameras were installed in 2011. There are
some very old analog cameras that are being encoded to IP and some cameras that existed prior to BCM being your integrator. This will
improve the camera images throughout. 
Upgrades to all the IP based 2MP fixed dome cameras at the Framingham High School to the new state of the art 2 MP Axis P3365 cameras
throughout. Add 10 new IP cameras at locations to be determined.

Justification: 
The existing bathrooms at the Barbieri Elementary School do not comply with the A.D.A. code
requirements. In addition, the existing facilities were built in 1972 as Middle School therefor the
height of the bathroom fixtures do not comply with the elementary school requirements. The
proposed renovation addresses the boys and girls gang toilet room on the first and second floor
for a total of 4 restrooms, (2 boys & 2 girls). There are additional bathrooms that will require
updates in the future.

Description: 
Masonry Repointing - Stapleton Elementary School 
Comments: 
Please note that the original estimate is based upon the entire building. It remains to be seen once the designer does his full study which
section of the buildings may or may not be worked on. This is because although some of the building was built in 1922, two other sections
were built in the 1950’s and in 1970 there was an addition of the library and gymnasium so that this brick exterior in those areas may not need
upgrading so the million dollar request is just a placeholder based on B H & A’s estimate. 
April 2014 Town Meeting approved funding in the amount of $48,000.00 for the design portion of this project which is currently out to bid.
Justification: 
The Stapleton Elementary School is in need of exterior envelope upgrades as well as masonry repointing and steel lintel replacement as 
needed above windows to prevent damaged caused by moisture infiltration and support capital investments previously made to this historical
building 
Masonry Repointing at the Stapleton School has been deferred since 2014 due to limited funding. The original building is 1922 construction. 
The mortar joints between the brick masonry exterior façade is original to that construction. The entire exterior brick, mortar, flashing and
sealants need to be assessed and upgraded as required in order to keep the building weather tight. 
This historic building is in need of repointing and we request the funds to preserve this historic educational facility.

Description: 
Furnish New and Replace Outdated Furniture 
Comments: 
In order to address District population growth at the elementary level, the King School has been reopened as an elementary school in FY17, 
and new furniture has been purchased. Current population growth is prompting changes in the District with the King School being converted to 
a ninth elementary school. Kindergarten students were placed at the King School in FY16 with an additional grade level added each
subsequent year until it reaches capacity as a K-5 school in 5 years.
Justification: 
The majority of schools have the same furniture that was purchased during their construction in the sixties. Although there are many pieces of
relatively new furniture in the schools, there is no way to refurbish the 255 classrooms that still use outdated furniture. Current teaching methods and
modern technology in the elementary and middle school grades require the use of laptop and other devices.

Description: 
Pre-Feasibility Study (Hemenway Elementary School) 
Comments: 
The District is considering replacement of the Hemenway Elementary School Building as part of the ongoing Capital Asset Planning and
required maintenance of the overall building infrastructure. We believe Hemenway to be of the most need for replacement. 
This Pre-Feasibility study is a first step in submitting a Statement of Interest to the MSBA for consideration of being invited into the MSBA
reimbursement program. 
Justification: 
The Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) offers a reimbursement program for major renovation and new construction projects. 
The City of Framingham is eligible for almost 58 % reimbursement for costs related to those large construction projects. 
A Pre-Feasibility study is required to evaluate the existing building, examine the demographic needs of the district and to determine whether a
new school building or renovation to an existing building is warranted. It may also be determined that an alternative site is best as a new
building may be constructed without interruption to the existing building and operations.

Description: 
The Buildings and Grounds Department is requesting the following truck: 
Currently the Buildings and Grounds department owns one “Sky Jack” condor type boom lift. This piece of equipment is now 18 years old. We
utilize the piece of equipment to gain access to school buildings and parking lot light up to 28’ in height. Currently we load this equipment onto
a trailer and pull the trailer with a pick-up truck to whatever destination require performing needed work. 
Comments: 
Justification: 
Instead of replacing this life-in-kind, we propose the purchase a bucket truck in order to eliminate the need of the boom lift having to be loaded
and unloaded and transported. This would save time, money and improve safety concerns in many ways (i.e. transporting, loading / unloading
replacement of antiquated equipment).

Justification: 
In FY19, Engine 2 will have met the department's criteria for normal replacement. Due to the conditions at the Fire Station in Saxonville, 
current Engine 2 has significant frame rust/deterioration that will pose a safety risk to firefighters and has accelerating maintenance costs as a
primary-response truck. The condition of the frame, and constant changes to fire truck standards of the National Fire Protection Association, 
make the cost of repairing and updating the current Engine 2 ineffective as a primary-response truck. Included in the replacement cost is the
cost for an updated radio for the new Engine 2 compatible with the current radio system, and a set of tools for the new Engine 2 that meet
today's fire department standards.

BE:Budget Letter For Fire Pumper Calendar Year 2018
ChiefHicks,
Please accept this letter outlining what I will forecast as a budget number for the purchase of a
Pierce Arrow XT~ 1500 GPM Pumper in the calendar year 2018.
Using the pumper unit that is currently in your fleet and athree percent annual forecasted increase
rates year over year, I will forecast the cost of asimilar unit in 2014 to be six hundred forty-eight
thousand, five hundred and eight dollars ($648,508.00).
Chief, as you well know many factors can come into play between now and the nett twelve months
as to cost drivers or even savings. Obviously if the cost are favorable this would be reflected in
our bid presentation and the same if the market adjusted upward greater than three percent.
We are grateful that we have had the opportunity to serve the Framingham Fire Department, its
Membership and its residence's. We look forward to acontinued relationship and the opportunity
to earn your future business. You are a valued customer to Minuteman Fire and Rescue Apparatus
and Pierce Manufacturing.
If there is anything else that I can assist you with regarding this matter please feel free to contact
me.

Description: 
A complete and accurate inventory, and the documentation and understanding of the condition and performance of culverts will be prepared, 
which are key stormwater assets for many roadways and neighborhoods across Framingham.
Comments: 
In addition to being a critical component of roads, the inventory fieldwork and documentation of this small subset of stormwater assets can help
establish standards for the collection of data for other of these assets, and better position Framingham for the long anticipated update to the
MS4 permit. 
Justification: 
Very few culverts (and other stormwater assets) have been addressed in Framingham, far less than for other infrastructure in the last couple
decades. Culverts play a very important role in the conveyance and containment of floodwaters, and the connectivity and preservation of
natural resources and biodiversity. The Town owns approximately 200 culverts from 20 to 100 years old, with most installed prior to current
regulations for flooding reduction and stream crossings. As with other aging infrastructure, deterioration of culverts continues, with repairs, 
rehabilitation or replacement likely to soon become critical for an unknown number of them and the related road(s).
To know what’s required, DPW needs information to forecast remaining service life, and a plan to address any deficiencies found, including
integration with the related roadway needs. That includes an assessment of potential failures and the effects on traffic, public safety, property
damage, flood fighting, emergency construction and others. This will assist in prioritizing capital investments, as well as qualifying and
positioning for funding from agencies such as FEMA, MassDOT, and DCR who have annually provided funding opportunities for culvert
enhancements.

Re: FY-2019 Capital Improvements
Culvert Inventory & Assessment
Dear Mr. Johnson, 
The Town of Framingham owns approximately 190 culverts that range in age from 20 to 100 years old. Most
culverts in Town were built previous to and do not meet current FEMA regulations for flood mitigation or state
stream crossing standards. VHB has prepared this letter to provide a description and cost estimate for the
inventory and assessment of the Town’s existing culverts. 
The DPW is in need of an evaluation of the condition and performance of existing culverts, a means to forecast
their remaining service life, and a plan to address any deficiencies found. A proactive assessment of culverts will
help the Town extend the service life of these culverts and prevent potential failures, which potentially have
significant impacts on traffic, public safety, and property damage. An updated culvert inventory and assessment
will assist the Town with prioritizing capital investment in improvements. 
The total costs associated with the culvert inventory and assessment of the Town’s existing culverts is estimated
to be $175,000.00. 
If you have any questions, or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me. 
Sincerely, 
Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc.

Description: 
These funds will be used to purchase a F450 4x4 Crew Cab Dump Truck to replace a 2007 Ford F450 Regular Cab Dump Truck with 84,999
miles, equating to 127,499 engine miles. 
Comments: 
Justification: 
The Parks Maintenance Department has a limited amount of vehicles within its fleet to support the operational demands. This vehicle, listed
within our fleet as Truck 12, is a F450 Regular Cab Dump Truck used to transport staff and equipment on a daily basis with additional tool
storage capacities (two large tool boxes attached to truck).  Due to its current condition and limited operating capacity, this vehicle is not able to
be utilized to its full potential. As a result, Truck 12 has been relegated to minimal daily usage. 
The vehicle has sustained major rust damage to its truck bed that is costly or beyond repair. During the winter months, Truck 12 has been
used in snow removal/treatment operations. As part of this, Truck 12 carries a bed-mounted sander during these months to treat Town
properties. As a result of operating in support of snow removal efforts during the past 10 years, this vehicle has sustained significant salt
erosion to its frame and bed mounts. Recently, this damage has resulted in multiple holes within the trucks frame and body, rendering Truck
12 incapable of continuing in this capacity. 
In addition to these deficiencies, Truck 12 will also require the following repairs to remain in operation: 
• Replacement of both sets of rear springs;
• Replacement of ball joints;
• Replacement of shifter cable and assembly;
• Replacement of shocks;
• Replacement of rotted break lines;
• Replacement of tie-rod ends.
After 10 years of operational service, the overall physical and mechanical condition of Truck 12 is significantly degraded, requiring
replacement.

RE: Capital Budget Vehicle Replacement — 2007 Ford F450 Regular Cab Dump
Truck
Chris,
As requested, the following is a description of the current issues with the 2007 Ford F450 4Y4 Regular
Cab Dump Truck. Currently, this vehicle has 84,999 miles on the odometer.
Due to the age of this vehicle and current condition, it is utilized minimally on a daily basis. Current
issues requiring attention, labor and expense are:
• Replacement of both sets of rear springs;
• Replacement of ball joints;
• Replacement of shifter cable and assembly;
• Replacement of shocks;
• Replacement of rotted break lines;
• Replacement oftie-rod ends.
During the winter months, Truck 12 has been used in snow removal/treatment operations. As
part of this, Truck 12 carries abed-mounted sander during these months to treat Town properties.
As a result of operating in support of snow removal efforts during the past 10 years, this vehicle
has sustained significant salt erosion to its frame and bed mounts. Recently, this damage has
resulted in multiple holes within the trucks frame and body, rendering Truck 12 incapable of
continuing in this capacity.
After 10 years ofoperationalservice, the overall physical and mechanical condition ofthe vehicle is
significantly degraded. Based on an overall assessment of the vehicle, I believe it has reached its
useful life expectancy and would recommend replacement.
Regards,
Donald Capen

The NEC allows the usage of this number taken at 125% to represent the existing connected
load. This number can also be utilized to determine the spare capacity of the existing service.
Taking 290.0 kW at .95 power factor equates to 368.0 amperes; this value at 125% equals
459.0 amperes, therefore the spare capacity of the existing service equals 2,541.0 amperes.
3. The new load representing the addition of the proposed HVAC equipment equals 950.0 kW,
or approximately 1,142.0 amperes. This value is substantially less than the 2,541.0 amperes
previously determined as the spare capacity therefore it will acceptable to add the new
equipment load to the existing service.

Microprocessor Control 
The operation will be accomplished utilizing microprocessor computer logic control. The elevator control program
will be contained in non-volatile, programmable, read only memory. Control will be constructed such that future
alteration in elevator operation may readily be made by altering the read only memory. Safety circuits will be
monitored and controlled by the programmable logic control with redundant protection. The microprocessor logic
will be enclosed in a cabinet. 
Landing System (LSQ) 
The new landing system will utilize a flexible flat metal tape that runs the length of the hoistway. An electronic
magnetic reader box on the car top that will see magnets secured on the tape surface that represent the precise level
of each floor level. This new equipment is a simper design and provides more accurate leveling. 
Hoistway Wiring
We will remove all existing wiring from the hoistway and new wiring will be installed. Multi-conductor type
wiring shall be used in the elevator hoistway. All conductors will be copper and shall be #14 for lighting circuits
and #18 for operating, control and signal circuits. All new duct and trough will be installed in keeping with all
applicable codes. 
Traveling Cables
We will remove the existing traveling cables and install new cables with 10% spares specifically designed for
elevator installations. The cables will be supported Kellum grips. Traveling cables will include shielded telephone
and/or intercom wiring terminating in a terminal box located on the car.

Summary of the Conflict of Interest Law for Municipal Employees
This summary of the conflict of interest law, General Laws chapter 268A, is intended to help
municipal employees understand how that law applies to them. This summary is not a substitute
for legal advice, nor does it mention every aspect of the law that may apply in a particular
situation. Municipal employees can obtain free confidential advice about the conflict of interest
law from the Commission's Legal Division at our website, phone number, and address above.
Municipal counsel may also provide advice.
The conflict of interest law seeks to prevent conflicts between private interests and public duties,
foster integrity in public service, and promote the public's trust and confidence in that service by
placing restrictions on what municipal employees may do on the job, after hours, and after
leaving public service, as described below. The sections referenced below are sections of G.L. c.
268A.
When the Commission deternines that the conflict of interest law has been violated, it can
impose a civil penalty of up to $10,000 ($25,000 for bribery cases) for each violation. In
addition, the Commission can order the violator to repay any economic advantage he gained by
the violation, and to make restitution to injured third parties. Violations of the conflict of interest
law can also be prosecuted criminally.
I. Are you a municipal employee for conflict of interest law purposes?
You do not have to be a full-time, paid municipal employee to be considered a municipal
employee for conflict of interest purposes. Anyone performing services for a city or town or
holding a municipal position, whether paid or unpaid, including full- and part- time municipal
employees, elected officials, volunteers, and consultants, is a municipal employee under the
conflict of interest law. An employee of a private fii~rn can also be a municipal employee, if the
private firm has a contract with the city or town and the employee is a"key employee" under the
contract, meaning the town has specifically contracted for her services. The law also covers
private parties who engage in impei7nissible dealings with municipal employees, such as offering
bribes or illegal gifts.
II. On-thejob restrictions.
(a) Bribes. Asking for and taking bribes is prohibited. (See Section 2)
A bribe is anything of value corruptly received by a municipal employee in exchange for the
employee being influenced in his official actions. Giving, offering, receiving, or asking for a
bribe is illegal.
Bribes are more serious than illegal gifts because they involve corrupt intent. In other words, the
municipal employee intends to sell his office by agreeing to do or not do some official act, and
the giver intends to influence him to do so. Bribes of any value are illegal.
PW-345 On-Call Road Rehabilitation —Newport Construction Corp. 
Page 16 of 25
Page 208
(b) Gifts and gratuities. Asking for or accepting a gift because of your official position, or
because ofsomething you can do or have done in your official position, is prohibited. (See
Sections 3, 23(b)(2),and 26)
Municipal employees may not accept gifts and gratuities valued at $50 or more given to
influence their official actions or• because of their official position. Accepting a gift intended to
reward past official action or to bring about future official action is illegal, as is giving such gifts.
Accepting a gift given to you because of the municipal position you hold is also illegal. Meals,
entertainment event tickets, golf, gift baskets, and payment of t~•avel expenses can all be illegal
gifts if given in connection with official action or position, as can anything worth $50 or more.
A number of smaller gifts together worth $50 or more may also violate these sections.
Ex~cmple of violation: A town adminish•ator accepts reduced rental payments from developers.
Ex~rnple of violation: A developer offers a ski trip to a school district employee who oversees
the developer's work for the school district.
Regulatory exemptions. There are situations in which a municipal employee's receipt of a gift
does not present a genuine risk of a conflict of interest, and may in fact advance the public
interest. The Commission has created exemptions permitting giving and receiving gifts in these
situations. One commonly used exemption permits municipal employees to accept payment of
travel-related expenses when doing so advances a public purpose. Another commonly used
exemption pei~nits municipal employees to accept payment of costs involved in attendance at
educational and training programs. Other exemptions are listed on the Commission's website.
Exatrtple where there is no violation: Afire truck manufacturer offers to pay the travel
expenses of a fire chief to a trade show where the chief can examine various kinds of fire-
fighting equipment that the town may purchase. The chief fills out a disclosure foi~rn and obtains
prior approval from his appointing authority.
Exayriple where there is no violation: A town treasurer attends atwo-day annual school
featuring multiple substantive seminars on issues relevant to treasurers. The annual school is
paid for in part by banks that do business with town treasurers. The treasurer is only required to
make a disclosure if one of the sponsoring banks has official business before her in the six
months before or after the annual school.
(c) Misuse of position. Using your official position to get something you are not entitled to,
or to get someone else something they are not entitled to, is prohibited. Causing someone
else to do these things is also prohibited. (See Sections 23(b)(2) and 26)
A municipal employee may not use her official position to get something worth $50 or more that
would not be properly available to other similarly situated individuals. Similarly, a municipal
employee may not use her official position to get something worth $50 or more for someone else
that would not be properly available to other similarly situated individuals. Causing someone
else to do these things is also prohibited.
PW-345 On-Call Road Rehabilitation —Newport Construction Corp. 
Page 17 of 25
Page 209
Example of violation: A full-time town employee wi7tes anovel on work time, using her office
computer, and directing her secretary to proofi•ead the draft.
Example of violation: A city councilor directs subordinates to drive the councilor's wife to and
from the grocery store.
Example of violation: A mayor avoids a speeding ticket by asking the police officer who stops
him, "Do you know who I am?"and showing his municipal I.D.
(d) Self-dealing and nepotism. Participating as a municipal employee in a matter in which
you, your immediate family, your business organization, or your future employer has a
financial interestis prohibited. (See Section 19)
A municipal employee may not participate in any particular matter in which he or a member of
his immediate family (parents, children, siblings, spouse, and spouse's parents, children, and
siblings) has a financial interest. He also may not participate in any particular matter in which a
prospective employer, or a business organization of which he is a director, officer, trustee, or
employee has a financial interest. Participation includes discussing as well as voting on a matter,
and delegating a matter to someone else.
A financial interest may create a conflict of interest whether it is large or small, and positive or
negative. In other words, it does not matter if a lot of money is involved or only a little. It also
does not matter if you are putting money into your pocket or taking it out. If you, your
immediate family, your business, or your employer have or has a financial interest in a matter,
you may not participate. The financial interest must be direct and immediate or reasonably
foreseeable to create a conflict. Financial interests which are remote, speculative or not
sufficiently identifiable do not create conflicts,
Example of violation: A school committee member's wife is a teacher in the town's public
schools. The school committee member votes on the budget line item for teachers' salaries.
Exafriple of violation: A member of a town affordable housing committee is also the director of
a non-profit housing development corporation. The non-profit makes an application to the
committee, and the memberldirector participates in the discussion.
Exat~zple: A planning board member lives next door to property where a developer plans to
construct a new building. Because the planning board member owns abutting property, he is
presumed to have a financial interest in the matter. He cannot participate unless he provides the
State Ethics Commission with an opinion from a qualified independent appraiser that the new
construction will not affect his financial interest.
In many cases, where not otherwise required to participate, a municipal employee may comply
with the law by simply not participating in the particular matter in which she has a financial
interest. She need not give a reason for not pa~~ticipating.
PW-345 On-Call Road Rehabilitation—Newport Construction Corp. 
Page 18 of 25
Page 210
There are several exemptions to this section of the law. An appointed municipal employee may
file a written disclosure about the financial interest with his appointing authority, and seek
pei~rnission to participate notwithstanding the conflict. The appointing authority may grant
written permission if she detei~nines that the financial interest in question is not so substantial
that it is likely to affect the integrity of his services to the municipality. Participating without
disclosing the financial interest is a violation. Elected employees cannot use the disclosure
procedure because they have no appointing authority.
Exaf~tple where there is no violation: An appointed member of the town zoning advisory
committee, which will review and recommend changes to the town's by-laws with regard to a
commercial district, is a partner at a company that owns commercial property in the dishict.
Prior to participating in any committee discussions, the member files a disclosure with the
zoning board of appeals that appointed him to his position, and that board gives him a written
determination authorizing his participation, despite his company's financial interest. There is no
violation.
There is also an exemption for both appointed and elected employees where the employee's task
is to address a matter of general policy and the employee's financial interest is shared with a
substantial portion (generally 10% or more) of the town's population, such as, for instance, a
financial interest in real estate tax rates or municipal utility rates.
Regulatory exemptions. In addition to the statutory exemptions just mentioned, the
Commission has created several regulatory exemptions permitting municipal employees to
participate in particular matters notwithstanding the presence of a financial interest in certain
very specific situations when permitting them to do so advances a public purpose. There is an
exemption permitting school committee members to participate in setting school fees that will
affect their own children if they make a prior written disclosure. There is an exemption
pei~nitting town clerks to perfoi~n election-related functions even when they, or their immediate
family members, are on the ballot, because clerks' election-related functions are extensively
regulated by other laws. There is also an exemption pei~nitting a person serving as a member of a
municipal board pursuant to alegal requirement that the board have members with a specified
affiliation to participate fully in determinations of general policy by the board, even if the entity
with which he is affiliated has a financial interest in the matter. Other exemptions are listed in
the Commission's regulations, available on the Commission's website.
Example where there is no violation; A municipal Shellfish Advisory Board has been created to
provide advice to the Board of Selectmen on policy issues related to shellfishing. The Advisory
Board is required to have members who are currently commercial fishei7nen. Aboard member
who is a commercial fisherman may participate in determinations of general policy in which he
has a financial interest common to all commercial fishe~~nen, but may not participate in
determinations in which he alone has a financial interest, such as the extension of his own
individual pei7nits or leases.
(e) False claims. Presenting a false claim to your employer for a payment or benefit is
prohibited, and causing someone else to do so is also prohibited. (See Sections 23(b)(4) and
26)
PW-345 On-Call Road Rehabilitation —Newport Construction Corp. 
Page 19 of 25
Page 211
A municipal employee may not present a false or fraudulent claim to his employer for any
payment or benefit worth $50 or more, or cause another person to do so,
Exarrcple of violation: A public works director directs his secretary to fill out time sheets to
show him as present at work on days when he was skiing.
(~ ApUearance of conflict. Acting in a manner that would make a reasonable person think
you can be improperly influenced is prohibited. (See Section 23(b)(3))
A municipal employee may not act in a manner that would cause a reasonable person to think
that she would show favor toward someone or that she can be improperly influenced. Section
23(b)(3) requires a municipal employee to consider whether her relationships and affiliations
could prevent her from acting fairly and objectively when she performs her duties for a city or
town. If she cannot be fair and objective because of a relationship or affiliation, she should not
perfoi~n her duties. However, a municipal employee, whether elected or appointed, can avoid
violating this provision by making a public disclosure of the facts. An appointed employee must
make the disclosure in writing to his appointing official.
Example where there is no violation: A developer who is the cousin of the chair of the
conservation commission has filed an application with the commission. A reasonable person
could conclude that the chair might favor her cousin. The chair files a written disclosure with
her appointing authority explaining her relationship with her cousin prior to the meeting at which
the application will be considered. There is no violation of Sec. 23(b)(3).
(g) Confidential information. Improperly disclosing or personally using confidential
information obtained through yourjob is prohibited. (See Section 23(c))
Municipal employees may not improperly disclose confidential information, or make personal
use of non-public information they acquired in the course of their official duties to further their
personal interests.
III. After-hours restrictions.
(a) Taking a second paid job that conflicts with the duties of your municipal job is
prohibited. (See Section 23(b)(1))
A municipal employee may not accept other paid employment if the responsibilities of the
second job are incompatible with his or her municipal job.
Exafriple: A police officer may not work as a paid private security guard in the town where he
serves because the demands of his private employment would conflict with his duties as a police
officer.
(b) Divided loyalties. Receiving pay from anyone other than the city or town to work on a
matter involving the city or town is prohibited. Acting as agent or attorney for anyone
PW-345 On-Call Road Rehabilitation —Newport Construction Corp. 
Page 20 of 25
Page 212
other than the city or town in a matter involving the city or town is also prohibited whether
or not you are paid. (See Sec. 17)
Because cities and towns are entitled to the undivided loyalty of their employees, a municipal
employee may not be paid by other people and organizations in relation to a matter if the city or
town has an interest in the matter. In addition, a municipal employee may not act on behalf of
other people and organizations or act as an attorney for other people and organizations in which
the town has an interest. Acting as agent includes contacting the municipality in person, by
phone, or in writing; acting as a liaison; providing documents to the city or town; and serving as
spokesman.
A municipal employee may always represent his own personal interests, even before his own
municipal agency or board, on the same terms and conditions that other similarly situated
members of the public would be allowed to do so. A municipal employee may also apply for
building and related pei~nits on behalf of someone else and be paid for doing so, unless he works
for the pei~nitting agency, or an agency which regulates the permitting agency.
Example of violation: A fu11-time health agent submits a septic system plan that she has
prepared for a private client to the town's board of health.
Exaf~zple of violation: A planning board member represents a private client before the board of
selectmen on a request that town meeting consider rezoning the client's property.
While many municipal employees earn then• livelihood in municipal jobs, some municipal
employees volunteer their time to provide services to the town or receive small stipends. Others,
such as a private attorney who provides legal services to a town as needed, may serve in a
position in which they may have other personal or private employment during noi~rnal working
hours. In recognition of the need not to unduly restrict the ability of town volunteers and part-
time employees to earn a living, the law is less restrictive for "special" municipal employees than
for other municipal employees.
The status of"special" municipal employee has to be assigned to a municipal position by vote of
the board of selectmen, city council, or similar body, A position is eligible to be designated as
"special" if it is unpaid, or if it is part-time and the employee is allowed to have another job
during normal working hours, or if the employee was not paid for working more than 800 hours
during the preceding 365 days. It is the position that is designated as "special" and not the
person or persons holding the position. Selectmen in towns of 10,000 or fewer are automatically
"special";selectman in larger towns cannot be "specials."
If a municipal position has been designated as "special,"an employee holding that position may
be paid by others, act on behalf of others, and act as attorney for others with respect to matters
before municipal boards other than his own, provided that he has not officially pat-ticipated in the
matter, and the matter is not now, and has not within the past year been, under his official
responsibility.
PW-345 On-Call Road Rehabilitation—Newport Construction Corp. 
Page 21 of 25
Page 213
Exay~tple: A school committee member who has been designated as a special municipal
employee appears before the board of health on behalf of a client of his private law practice, on a
matter that he has not participated in or had responsibility for as a school committee member.
There is no conflict. However, he may not appear before the school committee, or the school
department, on behalf of a client because he has official responsibility for any matter that comes
before the school committee. This is still the case even if he has recused himself from
participating in the matter in his official capacity.
Exat~zple: A member who sits as an alternate on the conservation commission is a special
municipal employee. Under town by-laws, he only has official responsibility for matters
assigned to him. He may represent a resident who wants to file an application with the
conservation commission as long as the matter is not assigned to him and he will not participate
in it.
(c) Inside track. Being paid by your city or town, directly or indirectly, under some second
arrangementin addition to your job is prohibited, unless an exemption applies. (See
Section 20)
A municipal employee generally may not have a financial interest in a municipal contract,
including a second municipal job. A municipal employee is also generally prohibited from
having an indirect financial interest in a contract that the city or town has with someone else.
This provision is intended to prevent municipal employees from having an "inside track" to
further financial opportunities.
Example of violation: Legal counsel to the town housing authority becomes the acting executive
director of the authority, and is paid in both positions.
Example of violation: A selectman buys a surplus truck from the town DPW.
Example of violation: A full-time secretary for the board of health wants to have a second paid
job working part-time for the town library. She will violate Section 20 unless she can meet the
requirements of an exemption.
Exa~raple of violation: A city councilor wants to work for anon-profit that receives funding
under a contract with her city. Unless she can satisfy the requirements of an exemption under
Section 20, she cannot take the job.
There are numerous exemptions. A municipal employee may hold multiple unpaid or elected
positions. Some exemptions apply only to special municipal employees. Specific exemptions
may cover serving as an unpaid volunteer in a second town position, housing- related benefits,
public safety positions, certain elected positions, small towns, and other specific situations.
Please call the Ethics Commission's Legal Division fot• advice about a specific situation.
IV. After you leave municipal employment. (See Section 18)
PW-345 On-Call Road Rehabilitation—Newport Conshuction Corp. 
Page 22 of 25
Page 214
(a) Forever ban. After you leave your municipal job, you may never work for anyone other
than the municipality on a matter that you worked on as a municipal employee.
If you participated in a matter as a municipal employee, you cannot ever be paid to work on that
same matter for anyone other than the municipality, nor may you act for someone else, whether
paid or not. The purpose of this restriction is to bar former employees from selling to private
interests their familiarity with the facts of particular matters that are of continuing concern to
their former municipal employer. The restriction does not prohibit foi7ner municipal employees
from using the expertise acquired in government service in their subsequent private activities.
Example of violation: A foi~rner school depa~~tment employee works for a contractor under a
contract that she helped to draft and oversee for the school department.
(b) One year cooling-off period. For one year after you leave your municipal job you may
not participate in any matter over which you had official responsibility during your last
two years of public service.
Foi~ner municipal employees are bai-~ed for one year after they leave municipal employment
from personally appearing before any agency of the municipality in connection with matters that
were under then authority in their pi7or municipal positions during the two years before they left.
Exa»zple: An assistant town manager negotiates a tluee-year contract with a
company. The town manager who supervised the assistant, and had official responsibility for the
contract but did not participate in negotiating it, leaves her job to work for the company to which
the contract was awarded. The former manager may not call or write the town in connection
with the company's work on the contract for one year after leaving the town.
A foi~rner municipal employee who participated as such in general legislation on expanded
gaming and related matters may not become an officer or employee of, or acquire a financial
interest in, an applicant for a gaming license, or a gaming licensee for one year after his public
employment ceases,
(c) Partners. Your partners will be subject to restrictions while you serve as a municipal
employee and after your municipal service ends.
Partners of municipal employees and former municipal employees are also subject to restrictions
under the conflict of interest law. If a municipal employee participated in a matter, or if he has
official responsibility for a matter, then his partner may not act on behalf of anyone other than
the municipality or provide services as an attorney to anyone but the city or town in relation to
the matter.
Example: While serving on a city's historic district commission, an architect reviewed an
application to get landmark status for a building. His partners at his architecture firm may not
prepare and sign plans for the owner of the building or otherwise act on the owner's behalf in
relation to the application for landmark status. In addition, because the architect has official
responsibility as a commissioner for every matter that comes before the commission, his partners

Description: 
The Potter Road School is one of several older schools that contain asbestos that we have identified. Ceilings, floors and pipe coverings above
the ceilings are the next area of priority that should have asbestos containing materials removed. 
Comments: 
In an ongoing effort to address, the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Action (AHERA) and comply with D.E.P. (Department of
Environmental Protection) requirements, the District performs six-month inspections for all suspected asbestos containing materials. Three
year reports are filed through a contracted Industrial Hygienist firm in order for the District to be in full compliance with the D.E.P. AHERA
guidelines for Public Schools. 
Justification: 
Because all asbestos must be removed at some point from all schools, even if the building is to be demolished, take a pro-active approach
and address large common areas of floor tile in corridors etc. that show signs of wear or curled edges. Even though there is no eminent danger
of the material becoming airborne or “friable” we want to remove it before it becomes dangerous. 
Please note that the majority of ACM removal and replacement listed must be completed during the months of July and August when students
are not in the schools. Requested amounts reflect the amount of construction and installation work that can be completed in this short time
frame.

Corridor Areas @ Potter Road
FY19: 
In an ongoing effort to address, the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Action (AHERA) and
comply with D.E.P. (Department of Environmental Protection) requirements, the District
performs six-month inspections for all suspected asbestos containing materials. Three year
reports are filed through a contracted Industrial Hygienist firm in order for the District to be in
full compliance with the D.E.P. AHERA guidelines for Public Schools. 
Any item containing asbestos must be monitored and if found to be in poor condition or in a state
where asbestos particulates may become airborne then it must be repaired or removed. 
Because all asbestos must be removed at some point from all schools, even if the building is to
be demolished, take a pro-active approach and address large common areas of floor tile in
corridors etc. that show signs of wear or curled edges. Even though there is no eminent danger of
the material becoming airborne or “friable” we want to remove it before it becomes dangerous. 
This latest request is a representation of planning ahead and securing the removed material
before it becomes dangerous. 
The Potter Road School is one of several older schools that contain asbestos that we have
identified. Ceilings, floors and pipe coverings above the ceilings are the next area of priority that
should have asbestos containing materials removed. 
$460,000
*** Please note that this abatement work must be completed during the months of July
through August when students are not in the schools. Requested amount reflects the
amount of abatement construction and installation work that can be completed in this

Department Request
Yes 
Justification: 
The national fire response standards of the National Fire Protection Association require that the Incident Commander establish a Safety Officer
for all significant incidents. The FFD policies dictate that the Deputy Chief in charge of the Training Division respond to such incidents to
perform the duties of Safety Officer. The response truck used for these purposes is a 2006 Ford F250 pickup with high mileage and
accelerating maintenance costs. This Project would replace the current Safety/Training Officer truck and repurpose the current truck within the
Fire Department fleet to replace a fleet vehicle with the highest mileage/hours. The Safety/Training Officer pick-up is also used to get safety
equipment to significant incidents and transport training equipment used at remote drill locations. The cost of this project includes the cost of a
new radio in addition to the vehicle, and the emergency lighting, cargo protection cap and department identification decal package.

Re: Arlington Street Area Infrastructure Phases 1 and 1B Design
Mr. Rogers, 
This letter confirms the need for $520,000 from the General Fund, and $90,000 from/for Sewer in funding
for the following project: 
Project
Arlington Street Area Infrastructure Phases 1 and 1B – Design
Summary Description: 
Investigations into the replacement of the ca. 1885 water main in Arlington Street revealed the need to
replace not only that water main, but sewer mains also, and almost all other key infrastructure assets in
the vicinity. It’s now been determined that most infrastructure in the South Framingham neighborhoods
bound by Hollis Street, Irving Street, Beaver Dam Brook, and the southern CSX rail yard are in various
states of disrepair or inadequacy, including other water mains with reduced fire flow and a high risk of
breaks. Addressing them all in a coordinated fashion will reduce the total cost, including for emergency
repairs. 
Noteworthy in the area is the inadequate and poor condition of drainage systems, both on and serving
private development, and the very limited amount of roadway drainage, resulting in frequent flooding at a
number of locations. Though no direct damage appears to be a result of that flooding, poor roadway
drainage commonly shortens the life of pavement. Also, apparent solutions to the flooding will require
excavation alongside, over and under water and sewer lines, with a least total cost solution likely involving
adjustments of one or more of the other infrastructure in the area, particularly in the relatively narrow
roads where new gas lines were installed in 2016. 
Numerous high priority sewer defects have been identified in this area, with cracks, breaks, gaps and
infiltration into the pipes and manholes. In addition to the cost of conveying and treating infiltrating
water, these conditions are indicative of a high risk of failure, and the need for greater maintenance due
to roots, debris and other clogging. 
Existing roads in the vicinity range from good to very poor condition (Pratt, Campbell and Hearth), with
nearly all sidewalks in at least poor condition. As with many areas in Framingham, there are also many
barriers to ADA accessibility.

A September 2017 “Arlington Street Improvements Study Report” evaluated and provided
recommendations to improve drainage, reduce stormwater flooding, and a plan to repair or replace aging
infrastructure such as water and sewer systems, pavement, curbs and sidewalks in the Project area. The
study report included: 
•  Identification of a preferred alternative
•  Phasing analysis
•  Construction cost estimate
•  Recommendations for next steps
The study recommended the project include three (3) construction phases to minimize disturbance to
residents, businesses and through traffic, and allow the Town to budget for construction over multiple
years. Recommendations for next steps included: 
•  Concept design of the entire area
•  Design of phase 1 of the project to bid documents
•  Design of drainage upgrades upstream of phase 1 to 60% design (referred to as Phase 1B)
•  Additional hydrologic/hydraulic analysis to estimate impacts on Beaver Dam Brook
Justification: 
Most infrastructure in this neighborhood is in a state of disrepair or inadequacy, including many water
mains that are over 100 years old and have fire flow concerns, frequent flooding due to very little
drainage infrastructure, with many roads and sidewalks in very poor condition, and without disability
accessibility. This project proposes to address these needs in an affordable multiphase implementation
that will also reduce disruption to residents, businesses and through-traffic. This project was deferred
from the FY2018 request. 
Key Assets (Phase 1 and 1B):
6,900 LF roadway to be rehabbed or replaced
14,000 LF sidewalk to be replaced or improved
5,200 LF drain pipes to be new (most), rehabbed or replaced
4,500 LF sewer main to be lined or replaced
4,500 LF water main to be replaced, with some potentially lined

Justification: 
The most recent inspection of this facility by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) resulted in a rating of “Minimally Acceptable”, with this

Subject: Saxonville Levee Stormwater Pump Station Rehabilitation Project
FY2019 Funding Letter
Dear Ms. Reis:
The Saxonville Levee Stormwater Pump Station (SSWPS) Rehabilitation Project involves the upgrade and
replacement of the station’s equipment and ancillary systems. The SSWPS was originally constructed
within an easement near Watson Place in Framingham, Massachusetts, as part of an Army Corps of
Engineers flood control project in the late 1970’s to protect the low-lying Saxonville area from flooding
from the Sudbury River.
The station is now in need of upgrades to replace aging equipment and code deficiencies to assure its
readiness in the event of future flooding. Key assets slated for upgrades include the diesel driven engines
and fuel tank, pumps, piping, gates, electrical & HVAC systems, and ancillary components.
Specifically, the upgrades will address the following:
·  Replacement of existing roof.
·  Demolition and replacement of existing fuel tank with a new double-walled fuel tank.
·  Improvements to restore the reliability of the existing diesel driven engines, including new clutch,
radiators, belts, and hoses.
·  Upgrades to the ventilation system to provide six (6) air changes per hour (when station is
occupied) as required by code.
·  Replacement of existing manual louvers with automatic louvers.
·  Replacement and upgrades to all existing electrical components, such as lighting, switches,
receptacles, and main distribution equipment.
·  Replace conduit and wiring from the pump station to the levee gate.

Description: 
The Annual Road Program utilizes several different maintenance applications to ensure the appropriate road condition. 
Roadway Resurfacing includes mill and Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) overlay, which is the process of grinding off the top layer of existing asphalt
pavement by means of a large milling machine and replacing this layer with at least two layers of a new HMA riding surface. A leveling course
may be applied prior to the final riding surface to resolve various roadway defects, ensure proper drainage, and provide adequate rideability
throughout the duration of the project. Drainage improvements are made if needed before paving. Curbing is re-laid or replaced if they are in
poor condition or reset for adequate reveal. Sidewalk reconstruction includes ADA handicap ramp upgrades. Signage and traffic marking are
upgraded. Tentative roads scheduled for roadway resurfacing are Fenwick Street, Wickford Road, Sturgis Road, Normandy Road, Sanger
Street, Thompson Street, William Welch Way and Speen Street. 
The Department also utilizes several different Roadway Surface Treatment applications including: 
Rubber chip seal is typically applied to neighborhood roads with low to moderate volume traffic volumes. The treatment is used to provide a
flexible, waterproof wearing surface that seals the existing pavement and is highly resistant to cracking. Installation includes a HMA shim
course to redefine the profile of the road, provide structural stability, and improve rideability. All utility castings are raised to finish grade, 
driveway aprons are adjusted as needed, and a rubber chip seal topcoat is applied. Signage and traffic markings are upgraded. The annual
road program is scheduled to include: Ridgefield Drive, Leonard Road, Lohnes Road, Blackthorn Road, Bantry Road, Rosslare Road, Tara
Road, Poskus Road, Hastings Street, Sunset Drive, Pitt Road, Cavanaugh Road, Fairbanks Road, Fairbanks Way, Highland Court, Murray
Road, Magnolia Street, Michaud Drive, Childs Circle, Woodside Cottage Way, Gil Leonard Road, Wyndstone Way, Highgate Road, and
Crestwood Drive. 
Rubber chip seal can also be used in conjunction with other roadway treatments as a Stress Absorbing Membrane Interlayer (SAMI). The
SAMI seals the roadway and extends its service life. Bonded Wearing Course (or Novachip) can be applied after a SAMI and includes a thin
layer of a polymer modified asphalt emulsion sprayed onto the road surface followed immediately by an overlay of HMA. Castings are raised to
grade and traffic markings are restored. Tentative roads scheduled for this surface treatment application are Salem End Road (partial),
Parmentor Road, and Nixon Road. 
Mill and fill operations are also performed by the Department in conjunction with specialized contracted equipment to address surface defects. 
Mill and fill can be used as a stand-alone roadway maintenance method or can be used in preparation for surface treatment products.
Justification: 
Without substantial ongoing improvements, the roadway system will deteriorate rapidly, and cost more to raise back up to a State of Good
Repair.

Comments: 
Service performance, pride of service and community support are all emphasized by DPW, with vehicle cleanliness an important expression of
those, and a responsibility of DPW staff. 
Justification: 
All of the existing vehicles being replaced will have exceeded 10 years in service when replaced (and sold), and nearly all are near to or over
100,000 miles or run-hours equivalent. Industry and Framingham DPW experience indicates that above those thresholds maintenance
increases substantially to assure service reliability, as do major repairs, none of which provide a return on investment, and they are not
sustainable with the current DPW facility and staffing. In addition to daily service for the various Divisions, they all are used for the
Department’s snow and ice management program, with many also used to respond to community events and emergencies. Snow plowing is
particularly destructive to vehicles.

Service performance, pride of service and community support are all emphasized by DPW, with vehicle cleanliness an important expression of
those, and a responsibility of DPW staff. 
Justification: 
All of the existing vehicles being replaced will have exceeded 10 years in service when replaced (and sold), and nearly all are near to or over
100,000 miles or run-hours equivalent. Industry and Framingham DPW experience indicates that above those thresholds maintenance
increases substantially to assure service reliability, as do major repairs, none of which provide a return on investment, and they are not
sustainable with the current DPW facility and staffing. In addition to daily service for the various Divisions, they all are used for the
Department’s snow and ice management program, with many also used to respond to community events and emergencies. Snow plowing is
particularly destructive to vehicles.

Description: 
These funds will be used to purchase a F450 Chip Body Truck to replace a 2000 Ford F450 4x4 Chip Body Truck with 43,495 miles, equating
to 65,243 engine miles. 
Comments: 
Justification: 
The Parks Maintenance Department has a limited amount of vehicles within its fleet to support its operational demands. This vehicle, listed
within our fleet as Truck 16, is a F450 Chip Body Truck used to transport staff and support tree removal/maintenance operations on a daily
basis. 
The vehicle has sustained major rust damage to its frame, necessitating a full body replacement within the past five years. Currently, this
vehicle has number of mechanical issues that will require repair to remain operational within fleet. These include a leaking and failing oil pan
and leaking rear main engine seal, both requiring replacement. In addition to these issues, the vehicle will also require the following repairs to
remain in operation: 
• Replacement of both sets of rear springs;
• Replacement of ball joints;
• Replacement of shifter cable and assembly;
• Replacement of rusted, leaking oil pan and rear main engine seal that requires removal of the engine and transmission;
• Replacement of shocks;
• Replacement of tie-rod ends;
After 18 years of operational service, the overall physical and mechanical condition of Truck 16 is significantly degraded, requiring
replacement.

RE: Capital Budget Vehicle Replacement — 2000 Ford F450 4x4 Ghip Body Truck
Chris,
As requested, the following is a description of the current issues with the 2000 Ford F450 4x4 Regular
Chip Body Truck. Currently, this vehicle has 43,495 miles on the odometer.
Due to the age of this vehicle and current condition, it is utilized minimally on a daily basis. Current
issues requiring attention, labor and expense are:
• Replacement of both sets of rear springs;
• Replacement of ball joints;
• Replacement of shifter cable and assembly;
• Replacement of rusted, leaking oil pan and rear main engine seal that
requires removal of the engine and transmission;
• Replacement of shocks;
• Replacementoftie-rod ends;
Currently, this vehicle has number of mechanical issues that will require repair to remain
operational within fleet. These include a leaking and failing oil pan and leaking rear main engine
seal, both requiring replacement.
After 18 years ofoperational service, the overall physical and mechanical condition ofthe vehicle is
significantly degraded. Based on an overall assessment of the vehicle, I believe it has reached its
useful life expectancy and would recommend replacement.

Donald Capen

Description: 
These funds will be used to purchase a Kubota Tractor 4x4 GST to replace a 1997 Kubota Tractor with 2,757 operational hours, equating to
96,495 engine miles. This new purchase will allow for the current Kubota to be used as a backup for daily activities and maintain a reduced
working schedule. 
Comments: 
Justification: 
This vehicle, listed within our fleet as Truck 22, is a Kubota Tractor that is used to maintain fields on a daily basis. This tractor contains the
ability to serve as a backhoe, fertilizer applicator, aerator, rototiller and front end loader. Due to the amount of engine hours accrued by the
tractor, it is a major risk of failing, which would cause significant setbacks to the daily operational needs of the Parks Maintenance Department. 
In addition to the age and amount of usage this tractor has experienced, the tractor will also require the following repairs to remain in operation: 
• Replacement of front bucket assembly bushings and grease fittings;
• Rebuilding of front bucket valve body;
• Replacement of cab;
In addition to these concerns and deficiencies, the evolving operational environment is requiring the need for an additional tractor with multiple
use functions. Currently, there are two Kubota Tractors (1997 & 2006) within fleet. During the height of seasonal operations, there is
continually a gap in service due to the rising need for these tractors and limited inventory. By purchasing this Kubota, we will be able to
adequately meet the operational needs of the Maintenance Department in management of over 550 acres of Town/City Property.

Description: 
Demolish and replace various size chain link fence, gates, and guardrail at various parks properties.
Comments: 
2019 
Main 2019 
Department Request
Yes 
Justification: 
Properly maintained vertical structures at park facilities have a dramatic impact on overall neighborhood culture and public safety. Properly
maintained parks are integral to neighborhood beautification, stabilization, site usability, public safety, and maintaining surrounding property
values. The Board of Selectmen Vision Statement indicates "Our Town will foster a sense of pride by placing a high priority on quality
education, neighborhood parks ... and promote a clean and beautiful Town." The "Choose Framingham" initiative identifies the fact that "the
average distance to a playground or other recreation area from any single family parcel is approximately a quarter of a mile." As such, by
replacing fence and backstops at park locations we are able to continue on forwarding not only the Board of Selectmen’s Vision Statement but
also continue to build neighborhood pride in local parks. 
In addition to maintaining neighborhood parks and other passive recreational facilities throughout the Town, the Parks, Recreation & Cultural
Affairs Division also maintains three cemeteries (Edwards Cemetery, Old South Burial Grounds, Main Street Cemetery).  Parks staff members
have identified needed replacement of various fence lines at these three cemeteries. Normal aging, tree damage and the need for fencing
placement has resulted in identifying these three locations for improvements. 
Phase 3 of the Fence and Backstop Replacement program includes improvements at the following Parks & Recreation maintained properties:
* Removal and replacement of chain link installations at Main Street Cemetery
* Removal and replacement of chain link installations at Old South Cemetery
* Removal of chain link installations and replacement consisting of wooden guardrail at Edwards Cemetery
* Removal and replacement of telephone stump fencing at Winch Tennis Courts
* Removal and replacement of oversized backstop at Charlotte Dunning Softball Field

Service performance, pride of service and community support are all emphasized by DPW, with vehicle cleanliness an important expression of

Justification: 
All of the existing vehicles being replaced will have exceeded 10 years in service when replaced (and sold), and nearly all are near to or over
100,000 miles or run-hours equivalent. Industry and Framingham DPW experience indicates that above those thresholds maintenance
increases substantially to assure service reliability, as do major repairs, none of which provide a return on investment, and they are not
sustainable with the current DPW facility and staffing. In addition to daily service for the various Divisions, they all are used for the
Department’s snow and ice management program, with many also used to respond to community events and emergencies. Snow plowing is
particularly destructive to vehicles.

Justification: 
The lifespan and reliability of these stations can be extended a decade or more through the replacement of component parts as they become
worn and inefficient, thereby reducing the near-term need for significant capital funds. For example, underground controls and Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems may be considered to be raised above ground for reduction of corrosion and for safety
purposes.

Description: 
The overall project is to line or replace water and sewer mains between Concord Street and the Natick town line, as well as the cross-country
sewer connector that runs north from Worcester Road through Natick, terminating near Cochituate Road. This work is to be designed and
constructed in three sections (I – Rt 9 eastbound lanes, including the Pierce and Dinsmore neighborhoods; II – Westbound lanes; III – north-
south sewer connector), with this request for the construction of Phase I, and the final design of II and III.
Comments: 
Approval and coordination with MassDOT, particularly in minimizing traffic disruptions, and coordination with a large number of businesses and
residences are important aspects of this multiple year construction project. Approval and coordination with the Framingham and Natick
Conservation Commissions are needed for Phase III. 
Justification: 
The need for this project are some undersized pipes, pipe age and materials, condition, and the consequences of their failure, with this
investment increasing capacity, reliability and fire flow, and reducing maintenance costs. Most of this infrastructure is between 50 and 100
years old, and they serve major portions of Framingham’s retail businesses, where emergency repairs and the disruption of service and traffic
would be very costly. The cross-country connector traverses wetlands, which make maintenance access and emergency repairs extremely
difficult, costly and damaging to the natural resources, especially during wet periods.

RE: FY19 Planning Level Cost Estimate
Worcester Road Water and Sewer Mains (East of Concord St) –Phase I Construction, and
Phases II and III Design
Dear Mr. Rogers: 
This letter confirms the need for funding for the following project: 
Worcester Road Water and Sewer Mains (East of Concord St) –Phase I Construction, and
Phases II and III Design
Opinion of design and construction budget: $5,700,000 (water) 
$3,800,000 (sewer) 
Total: $9,500,000
Description: 
This three-phased project will upgrade and improve the reliability of water and sewer systems on
Worcester Road between Concord Street and the Natick town line. Sewers and water mains will be
replaced or relined on Worcester Road itself, and the downstream sewer interceptor that currently
runs northward through Natick and a major isolated wetland will be replaced with a new interceptor
that runs along accessible roadways. This work will be designed and constructed in three sections: 
Phase I – Rt 9 eastbound lanes, including the Pierce and Dinsmore neighborhoods; Phase II –
Westbound lanes; and Phase III – new rerouted sewer interceptor. The funding request is for the
construction of Phase I, and the final design of Phases II and III. 
Justification and Comments: 
This project is needed because sewers and water mains are undersized and prone to failure as a result
of their age and materials, and failures to infrastructure could cause major economic impacts to the
businesses and residents in the service area. Most of this infrastructure is between 50 and 100 years
old, and the service area includes major portions of Framingham’s retail businesses and large
apartment complexes, where emergency repairs and the disruption of service and traffic would be
very costly and affect quality of the lives of many during outages. The cross-country connector
traverses wetlands, which make maintenance access and emergency repairs very costly, extremely
difficult, and potentially damaging to the natural resources, especially during wet periods. 
This multi-year construction project requires approval and coordination with MassDOT, particularly
in minimizing traffic disruptions, and coordination with a large number of businesses and residences. 
Phase III will require approval and coordination with the Framingham and Natick Conservation
Commissions.

Description: 
This work will continue Phase 1 (south of Waverly) implementation of “No Dig” lining repairs (aka trenchless), extending into the area between
Waverly Street and Worcester Road/Route 9. Investigations and planning will also be performed for the necessary, and more expensive and
disruptful “Dig” repairs in the Phases 1 and 2 areas, and a coordinated plan developed for implementing those repairs, likely as part of a Phase
3 Defects Repairs effort in FY2020. 
Comments: 
This work, and the anticipated Phase 3 Defects Repairs may be performed as part of a distinct capital project, with other capital projects, by an
On-call contractor, and/or by Operations staff. 
Justification: 
Framingham has studied 50% of its sewer system focused on identifying high priority sewer repairs that would reduce infiltration, as well as
extend the reliable service life of sewer system assets. Infiltration reduces the capacity for sewage flow, can result in back ups and overflows, 
and increases the billings from MWRA, which is based on total sewer flow from Framingham. Phase 1 repairs were implemented in late 2017
for defects at and south of Waverly Street, with only “No Dig” lining performed to date, since they could be implemented more rapidly, at less
cost, and none of the surface disruptions with “Dig” repairs or replacements.

Reference: Woodland PS Force Main Realignment Project
Annual Town Meeting Funding Request
Dear Ms. Reis.
In conjunction with the preliminary engineering services for the Woodland Pump Station Force
Main Realignment project under Task Order #7 of our MSA with the Framingham DPW, Stantec
prepared a Preliminary Opinion of Probable Construction Cost. This letter serves as backup for the
Annual Town Meeting funding appropriation on the total project.
The Woodland PS Force Main Realignment will eliminate the crossing of the existing 10" asbestos
cement(AC) force under the MassPike and replace it with a new 10" PVC pressure pipeline that
will start at the Woodland Pump Station and proceed along the northern side of the MassPike
right-of-way(offthe travel way) to the intersection with Edgell Road for a distance of
approximately 1,100 feet. The proposed new force main would then turn south on Edgell Road
crossing under the MassPike overpass for an approximate distance of 700 feet to connect back
into the existing 10" AC force main.
This project will address the Town's goals of improvements to public infrastructure and protection
of the environment. The existing 10" AC force main has experienced a collapse requiring
emergency repairs be made. Since the force main crosses under the MassPike, access for
maintenance and repairs is very limited making it difficult to address future problems that may
arise. The deteriorating condition of the AC pipe also increases the risk of releasing raw sewage to
the nearby stream and wetlands should another failure occur. The proposed replacement PVC
force main provides much improved access and protection against pipe failure and release to
the environment.
We recommend a total appropriation for the project of $1,735,000.

Description: 
This project will construct a replacement siphon in a jacked steel casing pipe under the aqueduct that meets current design standards, 
including redundancy and improved access for maintenance. It will also provide for a future non-siphon (gravity) configuration if the sewer
elevation is lowered on Waveney and Pleasant Streets. 
Comments: 
The work will conform to recent area roadway improvements. 
Justification: 
The existing single barrel siphon under the MWRA Weston Aqueduct has inadequate access for maintenance and does not meet current
design standards for inverted sewer siphons, requiring frequent bypass pumping and maintenance in order to assure flow from 500 homes and
prevent sewer backups. This project was deferred from the FY2018 requests.

Description: 
The overall project is to line or replace water and sewer mains between Concord Street and the Natick town line, as well as the cross-country
sewer connector that runs north from Worcester Road through Natick, terminating near Cochituate Road. This work is to be designed and
constructed in three sections (I – Rt 9 eastbound lanes, including the Pierce and Dinsmore neighborhoods; II – Westbound lanes; III – north-
south sewer connector), with this request for the construction of Phase I, and the final design of II and III. 
Comments: 
See related sewer main project.
Approval and coordination with MassDOT, particularly in minimizing traffic disruptions, and coordination with a large number of businesses and
residences are important aspects of this multiple year construction project. Approval and coordination with the Framingham and Natick
Conservation Commissions are needed for Phase III. 
Justification: 
The need for this project are some undersized pipes, pipe age and materials, condition, and the consequences of their failure, with this
investment increasing capacity, reliability and fire flow, and reducing maintenance costs. Most of this infrastructure is between 50 and 100
years old, and they serve major portions of Framingham’s retail businesses, where emergency repairs and the disruption of service and traffic
would be very costly. The cross-country connector traverses wetlands, which make maintenance access and emergency repairs extremely
difficult, costly and damaging to the natural resources, especially during wet periods.

RE: FY19 Planning Level Cost Estimate
Worcester Road Water and Sewer Mains (East of Concord St) –Phase I Construction, and
Phases II and III Design
Dear Mr. Rogers: 
This letter confirms the need for funding for the following project: 
Worcester Road Water and Sewer Mains (East of Concord St) –Phase I Construction, and
Phases II and III Design
Opinion of design and construction budget: $5,700,000 (water) 
$3,800,000 (sewer) 
Total: $9,500,000
Description: 
This three-phased project will upgrade and improve the reliability of water and sewer systems on
Worcester Road between Concord Street and the Natick town line. Sewers and water mains will be
replaced or relined on Worcester Road itself, and the downstream sewer interceptor that currently
runs northward through Natick and a major isolated wetland will be replaced with a new interceptor
that runs along accessible roadways. This work will be designed and constructed in three sections: 
Phase I – Rt 9 eastbound lanes, including the Pierce and Dinsmore neighborhoods; Phase II –
Westbound lanes; and Phase III – new rerouted sewer interceptor. The funding request is for the
construction of Phase I, and the final design of Phases II and III. 
Justification and Comments: 
This project is needed because sewers and water mains are undersized and prone to failure as a result
of their age and materials, and failures to infrastructure could cause major economic impacts to the
businesses and residents in the service area. Most of this infrastructure is between 50 and 100 years
old, and the service area includes major portions of Framingham’s retail businesses and large
apartment complexes, where emergency repairs and the disruption of service and traffic would be
very costly and affect quality of the lives of many during outages. The cross-country connector
traverses wetlands, which make maintenance access and emergency repairs very costly, extremely
difficult, and potentially damaging to the natural resources, especially during wet periods. 
This multi-year construction project requires approval and coordination with MassDOT, particularly
in minimizing traffic disruptions, and coordination with a large number of businesses and residences. 
Phase III will require approval and coordination with the Framingham and Natick Conservation
Commissions.

Re: Arlington Street Area Infrastructure Phases 1 and 1B Design
Mr. Rogers, 
This letter confirms the need for $520,000 from the General Fund, and $90,000 from/for Sewer in funding
for the following project: 
Project
Arlington Street Area Infrastructure Phases 1 and 1B – Design
Summary Description: 
Investigations into the replacement of the ca. 1885 water main in Arlington Street revealed the need to
replace not only that water main, but sewer mains also, and almost all other key infrastructure assets in
the vicinity. It’s now been determined that most infrastructure in the South Framingham neighborhoods
bound by Hollis Street, Irving Street, Beaver Dam Brook, and the southern CSX rail yard are in various
states of disrepair or inadequacy, including other water mains with reduced fire flow and a high risk of
breaks. Addressing them all in a coordinated fashion will reduce the total cost, including for emergency
repairs. 
Noteworthy in the area is the inadequate and poor condition of drainage systems, both on and serving
private development, and the very limited amount of roadway drainage, resulting in frequent flooding at a
number of locations. Though no direct damage appears to be a result of that flooding, poor roadway
drainage commonly shortens the life of pavement. Also, apparent solutions to the flooding will require
excavation alongside, over and under water and sewer lines, with a least total cost solution likely involving
adjustments of one or more of the other infrastructure in the area, particularly in the relatively narrow
roads where new gas lines were installed in 2016. 
Numerous high priority sewer defects have been identified in this area, with cracks, breaks, gaps and
infiltration into the pipes and manholes. In addition to the cost of conveying and treating infiltrating
water, these conditions are indicative of a high risk of failure, and the need for greater maintenance due
to roots, debris and other clogging. 
Existing roads in the vicinity range from good to very poor condition (Pratt, Campbell and Hearth), with
nearly all sidewalks in at least poor condition. As with many areas in Framingham, there are also many
barriers to ADA accessibility.

A September 2017 “Arlington Street Improvements Study Report” evaluated and provided
recommendations to improve drainage, reduce stormwater flooding, and a plan to repair or replace aging
infrastructure such as water and sewer systems, pavement, curbs and sidewalks in the Project area. The
study report included: 
•  Identification of a preferred alternative
•  Phasing analysis
•  Construction cost estimate
•  Recommendations for next steps
The study recommended the project include three (3) construction phases to minimize disturbance to
residents, businesses and through traffic, and allow the Town to budget for construction over multiple
years. Recommendations for next steps included: 
•  Concept design of the entire area
•  Design of phase 1 of the project to bid documents
•  Design of drainage upgrades upstream of phase 1 to 60% design (referred to as Phase 1B)
•  Additional hydrologic/hydraulic analysis to estimate impacts on Beaver Dam Brook
Justification: 
Most infrastructure in this neighborhood is in a state of disrepair or inadequacy, including many water
mains that are over 100 years old and have fire flow concerns, frequent flooding due to very little
drainage infrastructure, with many roads and sidewalks in very poor condition, and without disability
accessibility. This project proposes to address these needs in an affordable multiphase implementation
that will also reduce disruption to residents, businesses and through-traffic. This project was deferred
from the FY2018 request. 
Key Assets (Phase 1 and 1B):
6,900 LF roadway to be rehabbed or replaced
14,000 LF sidewalk to be replaced or improved
5,200 LF drain pipes to be new (most), rehabbed or replaced
4,500 LF sewer main to be lined or replaced
4,500 LF water main to be replaced, with some potentially lined

Re: FY-2018 Capital Improvements
Arlington Street Road Area, Sidewalk and Stormwater Improvements - Design
Mr. Johnson, 
VHB has prepared this letter to provide a description and cost estimate for the design efforts required
for sidewalk and storm water improvements in the Arlington Street area. 
The South Framingham neighborhoods bound by Hollis Street, Irving Street, Beaver Dam Brook, and the 
southern CSX rail yard includes infrastructure in various states of disrepair.  This area contains some of 
the oldest water pipes some in Town.  Replacement is need to both mitigate the high risk of water main 
breaks and to improve fire flow.   The area also suffers from inadequate storm water collection and 
disposal infrastructure, and the adjacencies among all of the subsurface utility infrastructure support a 
program to replace all needed elements together. 
Initial analysis will be performed to identify storm drain improvements needed in the area, and the 
project will develop the potential/likely phased implementation of water, sewer, road, storm and 
sidewalk improvements (likely in 3 to 5 phases/years), with goals of addressing them all in a least‐cost 
and least disruptive manner to residents, businesses and through‐traffic. The project will include the 
design and associated survey of a first phase of infrastructure improvements in the Arlington Street. 
This project follows the principle of renewing aged sub-surface utilities, while making needed roadway
and sidewalk improvements, in a way that minimized total capital cost as well as limiting disruption toresidents, businesses and traffic. 
The total cost associated with the design of Arlington Street sidewalk and storm water improvements is
estimated to be $350,000.

Description: 
This project is for investigations and design of the replacement and lining of aged and distressed sewer mains along the Central Street corridor
(Highgate to Purchase). Existing sections across private properties and along the river shoreline will be relocated to the road right of way
wherever reasonable. Investigations will be performed on the sewer lines discharging into this main, particularly those that are asbestos
cement pipe (ACP), or are suspected to be large infiltration or inflow sources.
Comments: 
Much of the investigations and survey can and will be used for the water mains in the corridor (design funding authorized at the 2017 ATM, 
with that survey also used for the anticipated future road design). A significant amount of ACP is likely to be removed. 
Justification: 
In addition to their age and extensive sections observed to be in poor condition, with likely infiltration and high risk of failures and back ups, 
annual jetting and root intrusion treatment are required to assure function, with access for that work made difficult and costly where on private
properties and along the shoreline. This project was deferred from the FY2018 requests.

Description: 
This study and preliminary design is expected to result in the replacement of 2 small and outdated pump stations (Flanagan and McQuinn) with
deep gravity sewers, and the needed improvements to the downstream Pleasant Street station, as well as the replacement or lining of 2 miles
of sewer, and the removal of 1,100 feet of asbestos cement pipe (ACP).
Comments: 
See the related water mains project. Increased cost efficiencies will result when sharing surveyed basemapping, and designing needed water
main replacements in the same sections of roads. 
Justification: 
All 3 pump stations are in need of overhaul or replacement, as are many of the sewer mains, and a 2016 study indicates the cost effectiveness
of this plan, with further investigation and refined study to confirm or modify that, and provide direction for the subsequent design. The
Lanewood Avenue siphon under the MWRA aqueduct that is downstream of McQuinn could be eliminated also, further reducing maintenance
needs and the risk of back ups.

This funding request is for design of the replacement of 14,000 feet of water mains, including surveyed base mapping. 
Comments: 
See related Pleasant St Area Sewers and Pump Stations.
Justification: 
The water mains along these streets require replacement due to their age, condition, size and materials, and will be less costly if constructed at
the same time as the planned sewer repairs and replacements in Pleasant Street. All are more than 7 decades old, some are substandard 6-
inch diameter, and some are asbestos cement, with the unlined cast iron water mains having interior tuberculation and corrosion that results in
decreased capacity. Replacement will assure adequate flow and substantially increase reliability of the water system in this area.

Dear Mr. Rogers, 
Reference: Pleasant Street/Temple Street Water Mains - Designs 
This letter confirms the need for $825,000 in funding for the design of the replacement of 14,000
feet of water mains, including surveyed base mapping for Pleasant Street and Temple Street. 
Pleasant Street and the northern end of Temple Street have 8-inch and 6-inch diameter water
mains that are unlined cast iron installed around 1920 and asbestos cement (AC) installed in 1939, 
all of which are near the end of their anticipated service life. The cast iron pipe has interior
tuberculation and corrosion, with reduced flow capacity and service reliability, and the asbestos
cement pipe deteriorates more quickly than other types of pipe. The August 2017 Draft Water
System Master Plan Report identified Pleasant Street as a critical water main needing high priority
improvement to address unlined cast iron mains. Replacement will restore capacity to the water
system in this area and improve reliability. 
The project extent is along Pleasant from the west end of the AC pipe (between Waveney and
Pine Hill Roads, near 1000 Pleasant Street) to Worcester Road, and the section of Temple Street
water main from Pleasant Street to the Mass Pike, which is approximately 14,000 linear feet of new
8-inch ductile iron pipe. The project will also include replacement of all water services to the curb
stops, and hydrants. 
It is anticipated that design for this work would begin in June 2019 and would have a duration of
one year.

Comments: 
See related construction of this project anticipated for FY2020. 
This is one of the last remaining century-old water mains in the 9/90 and Tech Park areas.
Justification: 
This water main requires replacement due to age, condition and material, with the unlined cast iron pipe more than 10 decades old, and both
interior tuberculation and exterior corrosion that result in decreased capacity and reliability. Replacement will assure adequate flow and
substantially increase reliability of the water system in this area.

Dear Mr. Rogers, 
Reference: Worcester Road (9/90) Water Main - Design 
This letter confirms the need for $135,000 in funding for the design of the 1,700 foot water main
water main replacement along the south side of Worcester Road, west of the Massachusetts
Turnpike, or potential lining rehabilitation, including surveyed base mapping. 
The 1,700 linear foot water main in Worcester Road between Crossing Boulevard and
Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90) overpass consists of 8-inch diameter unlined cast iron water
main installed ca. 1900 that is at the end of its anticipated service life. The cast iron has a buildup
of interior tuberculation and corrosion, which results in reduced flow capacity. The Draft Water
System Master Plan Report dated August 2017 identified Worcester Road as a critical water main
needing high priority improvement to address unlined cast iron mains. The Worcester Road area
supports a key commercial area of the Town. Replacement will restore capacity to the water
system in this area and improve reliability. The project includes replacement of all water services to
the curb stops, and hydrants. 
It is anticipated that design for this work would begin in June 2019 and would have a duration of

Description: 
The following proposal is being presented as a complete Framingham radio communication upgrade. This upgrade will prepare Framingham
for the future by adding repeater sites to resolve dead spots currently reported by the Framingham Police Department. Additionally, the radio
system upgrade will assist with the digital upgrade that is being required by Verizon with their copper to fiber migration. Lastly, the project will
supply the Parks and Recreation Department with an update to their aging VHF radio system.
Comments: 
Justification: 
This project consists of three major components –
1. The radio equipment (quotes from Motorola and their integration partner Voorhees Communication)
2. Fiber optic needs (quotes are provided by Comm-Tract Corp.)
3. Switching, optics and network engineering services (quotes provided by EPlus)
Below is a proposed breakdown by agency and what their requirements are. The unknown costs at this time are Detail costs for the fiber optic
installations which we are responsible for paying, as well as the cost of the necessary leased T1 lines to Staples and the tower on Chrysler
road in Natick. 
Fire Department requirements
Upgrade the repeater at Framingham State and relocate it to the MSP (Mass State Police) tower on Rt9. 
Upgrade the repeater from Metrowest Medical tower and relocate to Doeskin Water tank. 
Install a new receiver at DPW Tower/Western Ave. 
Upgrade the receivers installed at Stapleton School, High School, Staples (9/90 Complex).
Update to new comparator and gateways at Fire Dispatch. 
Police requirements
Upgrade the existing repeater at the MSP tower on RT9. 
Upgrade to new comparator hardware and gateways at Police HQ. 
Upgrade the existing receiver at Stapleton School. 
Upgrade the existing receiver at the High School. 
Current hardware installed at the MSP tower on Nobscot Mountain is ok. 
Current hardware installed at the Chrysler road tower in Natick is ok. 
Install a new receiver at DPW Tower at Western Ave. 
Install a new receiver at Staples (9/90 Complex).
Install a new receiver at BeeBees Water tank on Edmunds Rd. 
DPW requirements
DPW needs a fiber connection from the repeater at the MSP tower on Rt9 to the MSP tower on Nobscot Mountain, since this connection
cannot be made with a microwave connection without a tower at the Indian head water tank. 
Park and Recreation Requirements
Park and Rec is by far the oldest system and cannot be upgraded; they are currently running on a legacy VHF channel that is a non-repeater
system. The recommendation is to move them to a new frequency. Since it will be difficult to get a new frequency for a non-emergency
responder, DPW Water department can apply for a new frequency; they can then be migrated to the new frequency and the existing frequency
can be re-purposed for the Park and Rec department. Park and Rec will need a complete upgrade of the existing subscriber radios (truck
mounted) and a new transmitter as well. Exixting DPW radios will need to be reprogrammed to the new frequency. 
Building Services
No upgrades needed at this time; they currently use the existing emergency band and do very little radio communication. 
School and Transportation
No upgrades needed at this time; they are already running on a digital system and connecting the sites over their fiber optic network. Since
they are not considered a first responder they are allowed to have the radio traffic over a shared medium. 
Fiber and network requirements
Page 326
FY2019 Recommended: Bond $544,321
Fiber will have to be run between the Doeskin Water tank and the MSP tower on Nobscot Mountain; this will tie into the existing municipal fiber
backbone. We will need to install a fiber connection to the MSP equipment shed located at the MSP facility located on Rt9. This will allow us to
run a direct connection between the DPW comparator and the repeater. 
New Verizon leased T1 from Staples to Framingham Police HQ
New Verizon leased T1 from Chrysler Road to Framingham Police HQ
Install fiber from the existing municipal fiber backbone to the electrical room at Stapleton School and the High School. All of the fiber will need
to be connected back to the 3rd floor of Police HQ where the main the switch will be located to connect it all together.

20 Voting Machines - Includes hardware, election reporting software and hardware
Comments: 
Project originally requested and recommended in the FY2018 capital budget - voted down by town
meeting
Justification: 
Purchase Price
The Town Clerk purchased 20 Accu Vote machines from LHS Associates Inc. in July 2006 at $6500
each for a total of $130,000. 
Maintenance 
We have had maintenance contracts with LHS since July 25, 2006. From FY07 – FY10 the annual fee
was $3500. From FY12 – FY17 the annual fee was $4000. The current fee is $4500. 
Expected Useful Life and Replacement Schedule
The Accu Vote machines have an expected useful life of 10-20 years depending on care, average usage
and voter turnout. Manufacturing of the Accu Vote machines stopped in 2007 and parts are becoming
more difficult to locate, LHS estimates that they will be able to maintain support through 2020. Because
2020 is a Presidential Election year with an average voter turnout of 75% (30,000+ voters) I have
requested 20 new voting machines in the FY19 Capital Budget.

Description: 
The existing roadway bridge and sidewalks over Beaver Dam Brook will be replaced, including railings and utilities, completing other recent
rehabilitation and improvements to this roadway corridor.
Comments: 
The Town has a separate state grant for the upstream Beaver Dam Brook Stream Restoration Project, which is adjacent to Mary Dennison
Park, and which is awaiting resolution of contamination issues at the Park. While there is no plan to combine the two projects, largely due to
their separate and different permitting, funding and construction types, the two projects will be coordinated to ensure efficiencies where
possible and to avoid negatively impacting each other. 
Justification: 
The existing bridge was originally built in 1922, repaired in 1951, and is in poor enough condition that it has a posted weight limit that inhibits
full truck usage on this Urban Minor Arterial roadway. A majority of the cost will be paid from an approved state Small Bridge grant.

Description: 
The culvert carrying Landham Brook under Edgell Road, which is a couple hundred feet north of Edmands Road and Water Street, is in major
disrepair. It is a skewed 6 feet wide by 3.5 feet tall by 100 feet long cast-in-place concrete box, with about 1 foot thickness, and about 1 foot of
typical water depth. Rehab will include injection of grout at the upper corners of the culvert box, shallow and deep patching of the roof and
wingwalls, full-depth concrete replacement of the west end roof, a new curb, and erosion protection. It is not anticipated that reinforcement
needs to be replaced or added. 
Comments: 
This is near to, and related to recent and anticipated Nobscot redevelopment and intersection improvements. 
Justification: 
There is significant concrete deterioration, with exposed rebar and rust on the culvert roof (and underside of the roadway), and widespread
spalling and delamination at the wingwalls that cover up to 75% of the exposed surface areas. Proactive rehabilitation will be less costly and
less disruptive than replacement, particularly if that work was needed during or following an emergency (including failure).

Re: FY-2019 Capital Improvements
Edgell Rd Culvert Rehabilitation
Dear Mr. Johnson, 
The culvert conveying Landham Brook under Edgell Road is located approximate 600 feet north of the Edgell Road
at Edmands Rd/Water St intersection and is need of repair. The culvert is a skewed 6 feet wide by 4.5 feet tall by 75
feet long cast-in-place concrete box, with about 1 foot thickness, and about 1 foot of typical water depth. The
proposed rehabilitation will include shallow and deep patching of the roof and wingwalls including the addition of
steel reinforcement, full-depth concrete replacement of the west end headwall and roof slab including replacement
of corroded steel reinforcement, new granite curb, new guardrail, additional closed drainage, and loam & seed for
restoration. 
There is significant concrete deterioration, with exposed rebar and rust on the culvert roof (and underside of the
roadway), and widespread spalling and delamination at the wingwalls that cover up to 75% of the exposed surface
areas due to the stormwater runoff directly from Edgell Road. Proactive rehabilitation will be less costly and less
disruptive than replacement, particularly if that work was needed during or following an emergency (including
failure).
The total costs associated with the design and construction of the Edgell Road over Landham Brook is estimated to
be $310,000. 
If you have any questions, or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Description: 
The Annual Road Program utilizes several different maintenance applications to ensure the appropriate road condition. 
Roadway Resurfacing includes mill and Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) overlay, which is the process of grinding off the top layer of existing asphalt
pavement by means of a large milling machine and replacing this layer with at least two layers of a new HMA riding surface. A leveling course
may be applied prior to the final riding surface to resolve various roadway defects, ensure proper drainage, and provide adequate rideability
throughout the duration of the project. Drainage improvements are made if needed before paving. Curbing is re-laid or replaced if they are in
poor condition or reset for adequate reveal. Sidewalk reconstruction includes ADA handicap ramp upgrades. Signage and traffic marking are
upgraded. Tentative roads scheduled for roadway resurfacing are Fenwick Street, Wickford Road, Sturgis Road, Normandy Road, Sanger
Street, Thompson Street, William Welch Way and Speen Street. 
The Department also utilizes several different Roadway Surface Treatment applications including: 
Rubber chip seal is typically applied to neighborhood roads with low to moderate volume traffic volumes. The treatment is used to provide a
flexible, waterproof wearing surface that seals the existing pavement and is highly resistant to cracking. Installation includes a HMA shim
course to redefine the profile of the road, provide structural stability, and improve rideability. All utility castings are raised to finish grade, 
driveway aprons are adjusted as needed, and a rubber chip seal topcoat is applied. Signage and traffic markings are upgraded. The annual
road program is scheduled to include: Ridgefield Drive, Leonard Road, Lohnes Road, Blackthorn Road, Bantry Road, Rosslare Road, Tara
Road, Poskus Road, Hastings Street, Sunset Drive, Pitt Road, Cavanaugh Road, Fairbanks Road, Fairbanks Way, Highland Court, Murray
Road, Magnolia Street, Michaud Drive, Childs Circle, Woodside Cottage Way, Gil Leonard Road, Wyndstone Way, Highgate Road, and
Crestwood Drive. 
Rubber chip seal can also be used in conjunction with other roadway treatments as a Stress Absorbing Membrane Interlayer (SAMI). The
SAMI seals the roadway and extends its service life. Bonded Wearing Course (or Novachip) can be applied after a SAMI and includes a thin
layer of a polymer modified asphalt emulsion sprayed onto the road surface followed immediately by an overlay of HMA. Castings are raised to
grade and traffic markings are restored. Tentative roads scheduled for this surface treatment application are Salem End Road (partial),
Parmentor Road, and Nixon Road. 
Mill and fill operations are also performed by the Department in conjunction with specialized contracted equipment to address surface defects. 
Mill and fill can be used as a stand-alone roadway maintenance method or can be used in preparation for surface treatment products.
Justification: 
Without substantial ongoing improvements, the roadway system will deteriorate rapidly, and cost more to raise back up to a State of Good
Repair.

Description: 
This Urban Collector roadway bridge will be repaired, as will the sidewalks (that are now closed), water, sewer force main, gas pipes and
telephone conduit. 
Comments: 
A September 2017 letter from the state underscores known deficiencies and urgency for permanent repairs, with the potential that continuing
deterioration will result in load restrictions and/or closure in coming years.
Justification: 
This project was deferred from the FY2018 request. The existing 30-foot span bridge was constructed over the Stearns Reservoir in 1870, and
the superstructure was reconstructed in 1927, and is now in a very deteriorated condition. Interim repairs were performed in June 2017 (fill
holes in the deck), and in September 2017 the state directed Framingham to correct numerous deficiencies with temporary measures (fences
and barriers) and permanent repairs. New floor beams, sidewalk, bridge rail and guardrail will be provided, with some additional concrete
repairs performed, and the existing water line will receive new insulation. This work will extend the existing bridge life, and the need for major
or total reconstruction that will be much more costly and disruptive.

Dear Matt, 
Reference: Fountain Street Roadway Improvements – FY19 Funding Request
Stantec has prepared this letter to summarize anticipated funding needs in FY2019 for final design
associated with roadway improvements on Fountain Street. This phase of the project will complete
the design of new sidewalks, improved intersection geometry/installation of permanent traffic
signal at Dudley Road, roadway rehabilitation, streetscape enhancements, and
drainage/stormwater improvements currently developed to the 60% design stage. This phase of
the project will also include some remaining sewer lining to be completed following water main
replacement and initial sewer main/drain pipe lining work that is ongoing in FY2018. Construction
of these roadway improvements and related utility work, including a funding request, is
anticipated for FY2020. 
This corridor has conflicting and inadequate transportation modes, particularly for students, other
pedestrians and the disabled traveling to/from Keefe Tech and Loring Arena within the corrdior, as
well as buried drainage, sewer and water pipes in need of repair or replacement, and high
velocity and poor quality runoff into the southwest corner of Farm Pond. Results of the completed
project will include increased safety and mobility for al transportation modes, improved water
quality and other natural resources at Farm Pond, and a more attractive corridor. 
Town infrastructure assets addressed under this project include: 
•  Installation of permanent traffic signal
•  2,650 LF roadway rehabilitation
•  3,650 LF new sidewalk
•  1,500 LF new drain pipe and channel (an additional 1,600 LF lined in prior “Utilities” phase)
•  1,700 LF sewer main to be lined (2,400 LF lined in prior phase)
•  (3,500 LF water main replaced in prior phase)
This letter confirms the need for $210,000 in funding for the Fountain Street Roadway Improvements
project in FY2019.

Comments: 
Service performance, pride of service and community support are all emphasized by DPW, with vehicle cleanliness an important expression of
those, and a responsibility of DPW staff. 
Justification: 
All of the existing vehicles being replaced will have exceeded 10 years in service when replaced (and sold), and nearly all are near to or over
100,000 miles or run-hours equivalent. Industry and Framingham DPW experience indicates that above those thresholds maintenance
increases substantially to assure service reliability, as do major repairs, none of which provide a return on investment, and they are not
sustainable with the current DPW facility and staffing. In addition to daily service for the various Divisions, they all are used for the
Department’s snow and ice management program, with many also used to respond to community events and emergencies. Snow plowing is
particularly destructive to vehicles.

Description: 
This funding will provide for the continuing investigation and evaluation of the Dudley Road Landfill that will assess the extent of environmental
impacts and formal closure needs. 
Comments: 
Formal landfill closure is a multistep process, and a result could require extensive construction and relocation of the current yard waste
composting facility. 
Justification: 
There is a continuing compliance assurance need for the landfill per the MassDEP Solid Waste Regulations. Failure to close the landfill in
accordance with those Regulations could subject the City to fines, potentially dating back to cessation of landfill operations.

Description: 
This project will create an accessible, built-in audio-visual system in the Community Room of the McAuliffe Branch Library, for use by both
library-sponsored programs and outside groups. It will consist of a ceiling-mounted projector, Blu-ray player, wired and wireless microphones, 
speakers, assistive listening devices, control systems, and other A/V equipment needed to create a cohesive, easy-to-operate system. The
project also includes a projection screen for the McAuliffe Library Craft Room to allow A/V presentations in that meeting room, and portable
speakers for outdoor events at the branch. Some modest physical changes to the Community Room will be required, which will require the
assistance of Building Services. 
Comments: 
When the branch library was built in 2016, it had no budget for audiovisual equipment other than a projection screen. The Community Room
has proven to be an enormously popular location for meetings of all types, but the absence of a built-in A/V installation has proven quite
troublesome. At the beginning of FY2019, the building will have been open for 29 months; it is time to fill this gap. 
*Potential to use remaining funding from McAuliffe Library project - reduce appropriation request once confirmed
The amount required for this project is $79,932, of which $9,000 will come from MBLC State Aid, and $70,932 would be sourced from the
General Fund/borrowing. 
Justification: 
Completing this project will greatly improve the usability of the McAuliffe Branch’s Community Room, as envisioned when the room was
originally architected, by adding a high-quality, permanent, reliable audio-visual installation. Doing so will save staff time and avert disruption of
services by obviating the need to manually configure and troubleshoot our existing ad-hoc, temperamental, A/V equipment. It will allow both
staff and patrons to more easily run and enjoy presentations, performances, and other events, without the difficulty, limitations, and
unpredictability associated with our temporary solution. 
To provide patrons and staff with an interim method of hosting presentations, showing films, and amplifying audio, the library assembled an
inexpensive, mobile “projector cart.” This system was intended only as a stopgap, pending a permanent A/V installation. We estimate that the
cart has been used for library-sponsored programs and outside group events approximately 100 times in the first 10 months of CY2017, 
including Town-sponsored training programs. However, there have been numerous, serious problems with this temporary solution. 
The complete set of problems is detailed in the attached documentation (McAuliffe Community Room AV Capital Project Request), but in brief: 
The cart needs manual setup and breakdown by staff members, the public makes improper modifications to the cart configuration, technical
problems are common, equipment has gotten lost, the cart consumes valuable floor space, and the wiring creates a tripping hazard. Most of
these issues routinely threaten to derail important events, and interfere with normal library operations as staff must tend to unpredictable A/V
issues. 
In addition to the problems with the projector cart and associated logistics, there are also no built-in speakers in the Community Room. Our
basic assistive listening system needs to be augmented. And we have limited wireless microphone support, which affects our ability to both
host events with multiple performers, and the ability of hearing-impaired attendees to hear presenters/performers who might otherwise be fitted
with microphones solely for assistive reasons. 
Beyond the Community Room, events are also held in the Craft Room, but we lack a projection screen in that room. We also hold outdoor
events at the McAuliffe Branch, and have been frequently borrowing luggable, battery-powered speakers from the Main Library, which is
inefficient, so the Branch needs its own dedicated set of portable speakers.

abuse, mishandling, vandalism, acts of God, or other causes beyond the reasonable control of HB, for use of a product in an
application other than what the unit was intended for or attempted repairs by anyone other than HB’s personnel or
designated agent.
Such repair or replacement, when requested by the Customer, will be done by HB and billed to the Customer at the published
rate, including parts and labor. HB's standard field service rate is $140.00 per hour during normal business hours, portal to
portal, with a minimum charge of four hours.
Warranty Period
The warranty period shall begin when the client receives beneficial use of the system, or at final acceptance, whichever comes
first.
Extended Warranty and Warranty Options
Customer may choose to extend the duration of the Standard Warranty, improve on Service & Response Time commitments,
or request that Preventive Maintenance be performed during the warranty period. These options can be provided at an
additional charge and include:
•  Extend duration of Standard Warranty
•  Response Time Commitment of Next Business Day
•  Response Time Commitment of Four (4) Hour response to Critical Incident
•  Preventive Maintenance Visits – One or more preventive service visits during the Warranty Term.

SERVICE AGREEMENTS
Upon expiration of the Standard Warranty period, future service by HB is provided under Time and Materials terms and fees
applicable at that time unless Customer engages in a Service Agreement. The benefit of HB Service Agreements is that HB
will continue to warrant the workmanship and labor, provide Service Level Agreement (SLA) response time commitments,
and include an agreed upon number of Preventive Maintenance Visits during the term of the contract.
Service Level Agreements (SLA)
HB offers three maintenance agreements based on varying degrees of service and response times. Of course, plans can be
customized to individual circumstances and needs. Agreements are typically entered into for one to three years. As an
example, a typical Silver Service Agreement with average coverage for the equipment contained in this proposal would be
priced at $3,147.00 for a single year.
Strategic Staffing Services
Under an HB Staffing Agreement, HB assigns each Customer one or more HB Audio Visual Support Specialist (AVSS) to assist
in the use and operation of the systems at the customer facility. HB Staff Technicians are an extension of our client’s staff
and report daily to their assigned client site. They are typically responsible for ongoing support for the use and functionality
of audio and video technology, providing support for users, meeting and events, and may be involved in the planning and
implementation of change or new installation of AV, Video, or related solutions at the client location.

ROOM READINESS
The following describes the physical conditions we require at the site in order to bring equipment into the designated area.
These “room ready” conditions have been developed to insure proper site conditions that pose no compromise to the proper
operation and performance of the equipment. Further, they will allow our installers to work at maximum efficiency insuring
timely completion. Where reasonable or possible:
Conduit
Prior to commencement of work by HB, Customer will assure that adequate cable pathways or conduit are furnished. All
conduit may not exceed 40% fill per NEC standards. If HB discovers insufficient conduit capacity, Customer will remedy
without penalty or cost to HB.
120-Volt Power
All permanent 120-volt AC power and work is the responsibility of the Customer and must be in place. This includes the
electrical connection to any electric projection screens. All receptacles must be properly grounded per NEC requirements,
and all circuits must be of sufficient capacity to provide full turn on power to all system racks without tripping breakers.
Location of all 120-volt receptacles must be within reasonable and logical proximity of equipment.
Equipment Delivery
Prior to the delivery of all equipment and electronics, all spaces are “broom-clean” and the site is free of dust and dirt. All
construction, including drywall, painting, ceilings, flooring and millwork is complete. If, at the discretion of the Customer,
equipment is brought to site before it is clean, functionality, longevity and warranties may be compromised.
OSHA Requirements
Prior to commencement of work by HB, the job site must meet OSHA requirements for a healthful workplace. Appropriate
safety policies should be set, maintained, and enforced by all work forces.

CLOSEOUT PROCESS
In order to ensure that the client will be satisfied with a complete project, HB has developed a Closeout Process. This process
ties up any loose ends ensuring that the project is complete.
Final Testing
HB will complete final termination, testing and “de-bugging” of installed systems.
Documentation
All documents referring to the project including spec sheets are handed over to the client for their records.
Equipment Manuals
HB will provide sets of equipment manuals for each piece of equipment in your project.
These manuals can be hardcopy and available on CD.
Training
After equipment has been installed, HB will train the client end users on how to use the systems. Training is scheduled based
on the customer’s schedule.
Installation Sign-Off
HB utilizes an “Installation Sign-Off” form to signify project completion.
This document provides a mechanism for the Owner to acknowledge completion or receipt of beneficial use of the system or
to identify performance exceptions to the system.
HB is able to remedy such exceptions on a timely basis and then identifies the beginning of the warranty period.
Portfolio Consideration
Each client project is important to us and many showcase our quality of work. After project completion, with client’s approval,
HB will schedule a photo shoot featuring the recently installed technology.
In some instances, a formal case study will also be written and posted online or appear in HB marketing materials.
All photos will be available to the client upon request.

Christa McAuliffe Branch Library Community Room A/V Project
Capital Budget Proposal FY2019
11/13/2017 
Mark Contois; Alan Mandel
This is a Capital project proposal to install a permanent audio-visual system in the Community Room of
the Christa McAuliffe Branch Library. The amount required for this project is $79,932, of which $9,000
will come from MBLC State Aid, and $70,932 would be sourced from the General Fund/borrowing. 
Overview
When the branch library was built in 2016, it had no budget for audiovisual equipment other
than a projection screen. The Community Room has proven to be an enormously popular
location for meetings of all types, but the absence of a built-in A/V installation has proven quite
troublesome. At the beginning of FY2019, the building will have been open for 29 months; it is
time to fill this gap. 
To provide patrons and staff with an interim method of hosting presentations, showing films, 
and amplifying audio, the library assembled a mobile “projector cart.” This cart contains a video
projector, laptop, Blu-ray player, and speakers. This has been supplemented with various cables, 
adapters, microphones and other audio-related devices, as well as a basic assistive listening
system for hearing-impaired attendees. 
The Community Room is heavily-used for A/V purposes; we estimate that approximately 100
such programs1 (either library-sponsored or for outside groups) have taken place in the first 10
months of 2017. Town/City-sponsored training sessions have also taken place in the Community
Room. 
The McAuliffe projector cart was intended only as a temporary solution pending the installation
of a robust built-in A/V system. The most notable problems with the existing ad-hoc projector
cart system include: 
  The cart needs to be set up for each event, and stowed securely afterwards. Each step
consumes staff time and requires expertise.
  In some cases, the A/V setup is not completely intuitive, so time and care are required.
Not all staff have adequate training to set up the cart. Last-second technical problems
are common, and suddenly pulling staff from other duties is disruptive, and creates
ripple effects elsewhere in the library, ultimately inconveniencing library patrons and
detracting from customer service.
1 See spreadsheet CommunityRoomUsage-2016-2017.xlsx for details on Community Room usage for library-
sponsored events and outside groups. 
Page 1 of 4 
Page 384
This is particularly troublesome when events take place early or late, when the few staff
members present must interrupt both routine and time-critical tasks to tend to
unexpected A/V issues. 
  The cart must be formally and carefully checked in and checked out to outside groups to
foster accountability. This not only takes time, but also creates significant logistical
hurdles. When programs end in the evening, the library is typically lightly staffed, often
with substitute personnel who have little or no A/V experience. And when an outside
group needs to begin their meeting before the library opens, or finishes their meeting
after closing time, there is no staff at all to instruct, assist, or monitor usage of the cart.
  The cart has many connections and parts of it are fragile. Patrons or staff who are
unfamiliar with it can easily misconfigure the equipment, or even damage it. This has
been a particular challenge when outside groups start their meetings early (prior to staff
arrival) and take the opportunity to reconfigure the cart.
  The cart must be placed and wired near the center of the room, which subjects it to
jostling, poses a tripping hazard, consumes floor space where the audience sits, and
creates visual and audible distractions.
  With so much hardware involved, parts can go missing (and have done so). When this
happens, or when someone has improperly modified the equipment, the latent
problems may not become obvious until a future date … at which point the absence of a
necessary device, or the expertise to work around a misconfiguration, could completely
torpedo a planned event.
  As the location of the cart is fluid, and as the projector is available for patrons to fiddle
with its settings, there is no way to ensure a consistent, high-quality projected image.
  There is no built-in sound recording, amplification, or projection system for voice,
musical performances, or films. The audio setup is ad hoc and not of high quality. The
speakers on the projector cart may be too loud for attendees sitting next to the cart,
and too quiet for patrons in other areas of the room.
  The assistive listening equipment is limited, and should be expanded to support more
users.
  We would like to be able to support A/V sessions in multiple meeting rooms at once, but
the cart can only be in one location at a time. The Children’s Craft Room is a prime
target for the cart, however, there is no projection screen in that room.
The McAuliffe branch also needs a set of robust, battery-powered portable speakers suitable for
on-location or outdoor events. The Main Library has such a set, but a second set is needed for
the branch. 
Page 2 of 4 
Page 385
Process
The requirements for the proposed system were derived through discussions with McAuliffe
staff, in consultation with HB Communications, and were informed by our extensive experience
supporting A/V-based programs in the Community Room, as well as numerous events using the
built-in A/V system in the Main Library’s Costin Room. 
Proposed features
To substantially mitigate the weaknesses enumerated above, we propose a professionally-
installed A/V system with the following guiding principles: 
  Staff should be able to use all equipment effectively, with modest training and minimal
risk of loss or damage.
  One staff member should be able to set up and initiate a staff-sponsored event with
minimal effort, and allow routine events to proceed with minimal or no further action.
  The public should to be able to use many of the room’s capabilities without staff
oversight or substantial risk of theft/damage. These capabilities include showing disc-
based videos, displaying and using a computer whose image is projected on the screen,
displaying the contents of mobile devices, playing audio, and using at least 2 wired
microphones.
The proposed system, as supported by the analysis and associated quote from HB
Communications, Inc., would incorporate the following key features: 
  Ceiling-mounted projector
  Overhead “PA System” speakers and surround-sound system
  A publicly-accessible Blu-ray/DVD player
  Always-available, secure, built-in PC which is usable by the public via remote
keyboard/mouse/USB
  Wall control panel for input selection, volume control, player controls
  Wall connections for various video and audio sources
  Improved microphone selection and audio mixing capabilities
  Expanded assistive listening options
  Improved security and protection for most equipment
  Better expandability 
Page 3 of 4 
Page 386
  Built-in projection screen in the Children’s Craft Room
  Set of battery-powered, portable speakers sufficient for events elsewhere in the library,
and at outdoor events
Cost/Funding
A detailed quote from HB Communications based on the OFF40 State Contract, dated November
8, 2017, is provided under separate cover. The cost for their proposed A/V installation that
meets the requirements above is $79,932. This quote includes procurement, design, assembly, 
testing, most installation (see Other Notes below), shipping, staff training, and a 6-month
warranty. 
We are applying $9,000 from the Massachusetts Board of Library Commissioners State Aid
toward this capital project. 
Other Notes
The existing projector cart will continue to be used even after the implementation of the
proposed Capital project. We expect it be used elsewhere in the building, such as the Children’s
Craft Room. And it will serve as a backup for the new built-in A/V system, when the latter is out
of service. 
Completing the installation may require physical changes to the McAuliffe Community Room, 
and are not included in the attached quotes, as some or all of this work may be performed by
City personnel. Anticipated changes are: 
1. 120V power runs to various locations for A/V equipment (e.g., projector, closet, wall
panel(s)).
2. Construction of an enclosure within a wall for the publicly-accessible Blu-ray player.
3. Creating an opening in the wall between the interior of the two closets in the
Community Room for cable pass-through.
4. One of the following, to permit A/V connector wiring to be installed in a location that
works well with screen and lectern placement:
a. Knee wall removal and reconstruction; or
b. Installation of attractive wire molding.

Description: 
In order to comply with current ADA standards, create compatibility with our new RFID technology, and streamline service, the Main Library
seeks to replace the current main floor circulation desk. The current desk dates from 1979, before the Americans with Disabilities Act became
law in 1990 and before computers were used to circulate library material. This desk has been used eight to twelve hours a day for the past forty
years. 
Comments: 
Replacing the 40 year old circulation desk is critical to meeting the current standards for library service, especially as it pertains to computer
centered workstations and emerging technologies. Furthermore, a new desk will result in a reduction of service points, allowing staff to pursue
other activities and duties necessary in operating the modern library. Also, and most critical, the new desk ensure we comply with the
Americans with Disabilities Act and provide appropriate access to our patrons with disabilities. 
The amount required for this project is $66,038.00, of which $7,000 will come from MBLC State Aid, and $59,038.00 would be sourced from
the General Fund/borrowing. 
Justification: 
Primary reasons for replacement are: 
-Accessibility (currently non-compliant with ADA standards) 
-Reduction of service points from 3 to 2 made possible because of new desk configuration 
-New desk designed and built to accept RFID Technology 
-New desk designed to improve patron and staff workflow with RFID security gates
-New desk designed to work in unison with Self-check stations 
-Security enhancements will be possible with new desk design: 
˜  *Camera access can embedded into new desk
˜  *Cash register can be made less visible and vulnerable
˜  *Lines of sight can be improved to both entrances
-New desk configuration allows for the installation of ergonomic features such as cushioned flooring for staff and appropriate counter heights
-New desk configuration with new book trucks will allow for more efficient workflow such as returns, sorting and re-shelving of library material
-Marketing: Our new desk will have an illuminated display case built into the front to securely market our Library of Things--Roku, Google
Home, Amazon Echo, Wifi Hotspots, and portable battery pack chargers, etc. 
-The existing desk has served Framingham well for over 40 years and has seen approximately 60 million transactions come across the surface
of the desk. The desk is understandably worn (the original color of the laminate is unidentifiable in several places). This, coupled with the
rationale above, including the imminent installation of RFID technology makes now the perfect time for replacement.

95% Final Park Project Design and Environmental Testing/Remediation Design
Comments:

Main 2019 
Department Request
Yes 
Justification: 
The City of Framingham has been working in cooperation with the state environmental agency (Massachusetts Department of Environmental
Protection, MassDEP) and former property owner, Avery Dennison Corporation of Pasadena, CA, formerly known as Dennison Manufacturing
Company, to conduct required testing at the park and to create an appropriate remediation plan to address the environmental concerns at Mary
Dennison Park. Parks & Recreation has been limited in moving forward on the new park redesign, since the re-design of the park must be
developed in conjunction with an appropriate environmental remediation plan. We anticipate that the remediation plan could be developed
during the next fiscal year, although an in-depth (100%) design will likely take longer. Also, some additional testing of the park’s adjacent
properties is required and is currently in process. Therefore, this appropriation request includes funding for both park re-design steps as well
as further testing and environmental cleanup planning. 
Prior Town Meeting appropriations have allowed us to complete the environmental testing of the park property itself and to perform short-term
remediation, primarily of the eastern playground area; the rest of the park has remained open for its existing uses. This remediation allowed the
Parks Department to temporarily re-open the eastern playground for public use until the long-term remediation plan is implemented. 
Our Department has conducted public meetings to assist in defining and incorporating the neighborhood’s vision for a re-designed park as well
as regular project updates to the community. In this next phase, the preliminary design/design development plans for the park will be
developed along with the environmental remediation design plans. 
The FY 2019 Capital funding request for this project will enable the City to begin the 95% Final Project Park and Environmental Feasibility
Study/Remediation Design. The identified funding request and projected timeline is a budget estimate based on current available information
and is subject to change as additional information becomes available.

Description: 
This project is a continuation of a multi-phase improvement plan for Butterworth Park. Completion of this project will continue to accomplish
important identified improvements to this valued neighborhood Park. 
Comments: 
Justification: 
The present phase of the Butterworth Park improvement plan consists of
relocation of the current full basketball court to a more appropriate location
within the facility. In a prior improvement phase, the Parks Department received
funding for the removal of a failing concrete bleacher structure that provided
spectator seating along the baseball diamond. Once this structure was removed
the basketball court was exposed to a potential foul ball hazard. To mitigate this
concern, the Parks Department is proposing relocation of the full sized court and
returning the current location back to green space. 
The new court will be relocated parallel to Grant Street in the current location of the aging half-court basketball court. This will require grinding
and removal of the current full sized basketball court. This area will then be returned to green space, further beautifying the park and adding
an additional location for families to recreate. The half-court will then be removed and a new full sized court will be constructed in its place. 
Finally, an accessible pathway will be built leading to the new court from the existing interior park pathway. 
This improvement project is Phase VI in the Butterworth Park improvement plan. Prior Park Improvement Phases include: 
• Phase I – Construction of a new internal parking lot and formalization of perimeter parking along Arthur Street.
• Phase II – Installation of lighting at tennis courts.
• Phase III – Removal of old concrete bleacher structure and installation of new ADA seating at baseball diamond.
• Phase IV – Installation of accessible interior park pathway and reconfiguration of Grant Street entrance to park.
• Phase V – Installation of shade shelter at playground (ongoing)
The Parks Department’s mission statement it “to create recreation opportunities, preserve open space, manage public athletic fields and parks, 
and administer recreation programs and facilities for the varied population of Framingham.” Neighborhood parks are essential in providing safe
space for the community to gather. These proposed improvements to Butterworth Park continue our effort to further our mission statement as
well as to provide a neighborhood park that residents can be proud of. 
In an effort to continue in our mission to provide a safe and well maintained park that the Butterworth neighborhood can feel proud of, the
Division of Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs respectfully requests funding for this Phase VI park improvement request.

Description: 
These funds will be used to purchase a F350 4x4 Crew Cab Pickup Truck to replace a 2001 Ford F350 4x4 Regular Cab Pickup Truck with
79,723 miles, equating to 119,585 engine miles. 
Comments: 
Justification: 
The Parks Maintenance Department has a limited amount of vehicles within its fleet to support the operational demands. This vehicle, listed
within our fleet as Truck 3, is a F350 4x4 Crew Cab Pickup truck used to transport staff on a limited basis. Due to its current condition, this
vehicle is no longer used to transport equipment and has greatly decreased its capabilities to serve within the fleet. 
In the past calendar year, this vehicle has undergone numerous repairs in order to pass State Inspection. These repairs have included the
replacement of ball joints, and replacement of the shifter cable. Over the past year, Truck 3 has sustained additional rust damage that has
required minor body work repairs in an effort to stabilize the vehicle for usage. These repairs have included work to the bed mounts, wheel
wells, and front bumper. Due to the age and continued (while limited), usage of Truck 3, we anticipate this vehicle will continue to deteriorate, 
further limiting its usefulness. In addition, the current condition and continued deterioration of Truck 3 prevent the vehicle from passing State
vehicle inspection next year. Those repairs include, but are not limited to: 
• Replacement of both sets of rear springs;
• Replacement of rusted, leaking oil pan and rear main engine seal that requires removal of the engine and transmission;
• Replacement of shocks;
• Replacement of rotted break lines;
After 17 years of operational service, the overall physical and mechanical condition of the vehicle is significantly degraded, requiring
replacement.

Memorandum
From the desk of Donald Capen
November 4, 2017
RE: Capital Budget Vehicle Replacement — 2001 Ford F350 4x4 Regular Cab Pickup
C~11'IS,
As requested, the following is a description of the current issues with the 2001 Ford F350 4x4 Regular
Cab Pickup. Currently, this vehicle has 79,723 miles on the odometer.
Due to its current condition, this vehicle is no longer used to transport equipment and has greatly
decreased its capabilities to serve within the fleet. Current issues requiring attention, labor and
expense are: 
• Replacement of both sets of rear springs;
• Replacement of rusted, leaking oil pan and rear main engine seal that
requires removal of the engine and transmission;
Replacement of shocks;
• Replacement of rotted break lines;
In the past calendar year, this vehicle has undergone numerous repairs in order to pass State
Inspection. These repairs have included the replacement of ball joints, and replacement of the
shifter cable. Over the past year, Truck 3 has sustained additional rust damage that has required
minor body work repairs in an effort to stabilize the vehicle for usage.
After 17 years ofoperationalservice, the overall physical and mechanical condition ofthe vehicle is
significantly degraded. Based on an overall assessment of the vehicle, I believe it has reached its
useful life expectancy and would recommend replacement.
Regards,
Donald Capen

Description: 
Technology Upgrades Throughout the District Tech
Comments: 
The Office of Technology is requesting funds to continue to move forward with the District Technology Plan. The goal of the plan is to provide
a strong and dependable infrastructure as well as appropriate devices to support an advanced learning environment for the 21st century
student and educator. The Office’s intent is to lead and collaborate with students, staff and district administration to meet both instructional
and administrative goals of teaching and learning district-wide. These funds are also being requested to refresh aged staff laptops over 4
years old, and upgrade to a high-performance network using current technology.
Justification: 
Capital Technology - Justification
The Office of Technology is responsible for providing a technical foundation and vision to support the advance learning environment of the
21st century student and educator. The intent is to lead and collaborate across the spectrum of students, staff and district administration to
meet both instructional and administrative goals of teaching and learning district-wide. Framingham Public Schools will continue to invest in
technology throughout the district with a focus on student and staff needs. 
Chromebooks
The Framingham Public School district has made an initial investment in the use of Google based Chromebook in the classroom. 
Chromebooks are low cost keyboard based solution for putting technology into the student’s hands and integrates directly with the district’s
investment in Google Apps for Education. The Google WebApp store offers a wide selection of free and paid-for apps spanning educational
and business categories. The district's goal is to ensure that every student has access to technology and online resources. This request is to
support the continued deployment and refresh of devices in the classroom in an equitable manner. Devices will be distributed based on a
student ratio and the school's commitment to enhancing their digital curriculum. 
Staff Laptops
The Framingham Public School District must continue to invest in tools to assist staff within the classroom and learning environment. The
average lifespan of these devices, stated by the vendor is 5 years. The district has distributed devices starting in 2010 but has not established
a replenishment process to replace the depreciated devices. The Office of Technology has developed a schedule to replace 25% of the staff
laptops each year over the next 4 years. The investment to staff devices should be viewed as a re-occurring cost. 
Classroom Projectors
Each classroom the district has been equipped over the years with technology to support the learning environment. LCD projectors are useful
in presenting and sharing in a group environment. Current LCD projectors are aging and many within the district are reaching 10 years. This
investment is intended to replenish 15% of the aged staff/classroom tools. 
School Library Technology Upgrades
The Framingham Public School District continues to develop and support the Framingham Public Schools Library program. The impact an
effective 21st century library can have on students, teachers, and administrators is unquestionable. A well-functioning library is the
nexus of the school, supporting teachers and positively impacting student learning, information literacy, and achievement; and helps promote
positive digital citizenship. Each School Library has requested upgrades in the technology needed to create and operate an environment
focused on research. This investment will continue to provide seamless access to digital resources, integrate technology into the curriculum of
the Framingham Public School district, and to assist the learning community through efficient processes and training.

Although we await the results of the Fuller School MSBA Feasibility Study to determine whether the Farley Building will be prepared for swing
space or a temporary home for staff and students’ while the new Fuller is being constructed, we do know that all of the other occupants, i.e. 
Buildings and Grounds, Parent Information Center, Town Board of Health Department, Adult ESL, Truant Officer and ECA (Early Childhood
Assessment) will require a new home. It remains to be seen where those offices will relocate too. 
We anticipate that the Farley Building will become a mixed use building and will house some form of education, whether it be Mass Bay
Community College or FPS, (Adult ESL or something else) is still to be determined but we know that will need to house Maintenance, 
Administrative and some education. 
Justification: 
The Fuller School houses currently the Buildings and Grounds Department comprised of the Buildings and Grounds office and maintenance
shop as well as vehicle and equipment storage. 
The Department occupies approximately 30,000 square feet. We have preparations and designs of the Farley Building in the existing pool and
locker room area and plan to relocate and house the B &G Departments at Farley in that area of the building. A new roof and exterior siding as
well as demolition and infill of the existing pool were done last year and an overhead door was installed in preparation of converting the pool to a
maintenance garage and shop for Buildings and Grounds. 
The next phase of work will include demolition of existing C.M.U. walls, and plaster ceilings in the locker room areas – reframing new partitions
per the architects plan, purchasing and installing a new HVAC unit, fire alarm, electrical, plumbing and mechanical systems and installation of
new concrete floors are where the swimming pool was.

For the FY19 school year, the District is requesting funding for the following: 
The Walsh school is a 26 camera add, based on the walkthrough with the principal. Most of these cameras were installed in 2011. There are
some very old analog cameras that are being encoded to IP and some cameras that existed prior to BCM being your integrator. This will

Masonry Repointing - Stapleton Elementary School 
Comments: 
Please note that the original estimate is based upon the entire building. It remains to be seen once the designer does his full study which
section of the buildings may or may not be worked on. This is because although some of the building was built in 1922, two other sections
were built in the 1950’s and in 1970 there was an addition of the library and gymnasium so that this brick exterior in those areas may not need
upgrading so the million dollar request is just a placeholder based on B H & A’s estimate. 
April 2014 Town Meeting approved funding in the amount of $48,000.00 for the design portion of this project which is currently out to bid.
Justification: 
The Stapleton Elementary School is in need of exterior envelope upgrades as well as masonry repointing and steel lintel replacement as 
needed above windows to prevent damaged caused by moisture infiltration and support capital investments previously made to this historical
building 
Masonry Repointing at the Stapleton School has been deferred since 2014 due to limited funding. The original building is 1922 construction. 
The mortar joints between the brick masonry exterior façade is original to that construction. The entire exterior brick, mortar, flashing and
sealants need to be assessed and upgraded as required in order to keep the building weather tight. 
This historic building is in need of repointing and we request the funds to preserve this historic educational facility.

Furnish New and Replace Outdated Furniture 
Comments: 
In order to address District population growth at the elementary level, the King School has been reopened as an elementary school in FY17, 
and new furniture has been purchased. Current population growth is prompting changes in the District with the King School being converted to 
a ninth elementary school. Kindergarten students were placed at the King School in FY16 with an additional grade level added each
subsequent year until it reaches capacity as a K-5 school in 5 years.
Justification: 
The majority of schools have the same furniture that was purchased during their construction in the sixties. Although there are many pieces of
relatively new furniture in the schools, there is no way to refurbish the 255 classrooms that still use outdated furniture. Current teaching methods and
modern technology in the elementary and middle school grades require the use of laptop and other devices.

Description: 
Pre-Feasibility Study (Hemenway Elementary School) 
Comments: 
The District is considering replacement of the Hemenway Elementary School Building as part of the ongoing Capital Asset Planning and
required maintenance of the overall building infrastructure. We believe Hemenway to be of the most need for replacement. 
This Pre-Feasibility study is a first step in submitting a Statement of Interest to the MSBA for consideration of being invited into the MSBA
reimbursement program. 
Justification: 
The Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) offers a reimbursement program for major renovation and new construction projects. 
The City of Framingham is eligible for almost 58 % reimbursement for costs related to those large construction projects. 
A Pre-Feasibility study is required to evaluate the existing building, examine the demographic needs of the district and to determine whether a
new school building or renovation to an existing building is warranted. It may also be determined that an alternative site is best as a new
building may be constructed without interruption to the existing building and operations.

The Buildings and Grounds Department is requesting the following truck: 
Currently the Buildings and Grounds department owns one “Sky Jack” condor type boom lift. This piece of equipment is now 18 years old. We
utilize the piece of equipment to gain access to school buildings and parking lot light up to 28’ in height. Currently we load this equipment onto
a trailer and pull the trailer with a pick-up truck to whatever destination require performing needed work. 
Comments: 
Justification: 
Instead of replacing this life-in-kind, we propose the purchase a bucket truck in order to eliminate the need of the boom lift having to be loaded
and unloaded and transported. This would save time, money and improve safety concerns in many ways (i.e. transporting, loading / unloading
replacement of antiquated equipment).

Justification: 
In FY19, Engine 2 will have met the department's criteria for normal replacement. Due to the conditions at the Fire Station in Saxonville, 
current Engine 2 has significant frame rust/deterioration that will pose a safety risk to firefighters and has accelerating maintenance costs as a
primary-response truck. The condition of the frame, and constant changes to fire truck standards of the National Fire Protection Association, 
make the cost of repairing and updating the current Engine 2 ineffective as a primary-response truck. Included in the replacement cost is the
cost for an updated radio for the new Engine 2 compatible with the current radio system, and a set of tools for the new Engine 2 that meet
today's fire department standards.

BE:Budget Letter For Fire Pumper Calendar Year 2018
ChiefHicks,
Please accept this letter outlining what I will forecast as a budget number for the purchase of a
Pierce Arrow XT~ 1500 GPM Pumper in the calendar year 2018.
Using the pumper unit that is currently in your fleet and athree percent annual forecasted increase
rates year over year, I will forecast the cost of asimilar unit in 2014 to be six hundred forty-eight
thousand, five hundred and eight dollars ($648,508.00).
Chief, as you well know many factors can come into play between now and the nett twelve months
as to cost drivers or even savings. Obviously if the cost are favorable this would be reflected in
our bid presentation and the same if the market adjusted upward greater than three percent.
We are grateful that we have had the opportunity to serve the Framingham Fire Department, its
Membership and its residence's. We look forward to acontinued relationship and the opportunity
to earn your future business. You are a valued customer to Minuteman Fire and Rescue Apparatus
and Pierce Manufacturing.
If there is anything else that I can assist you with regarding this matter please feel free to contact
me.

Description: 
Purchase a new SUV for use by the on-duty Deputy Chief (Shift Supervisor) to be used for incident command. This vehicle is housed at
Station 5 (Concord Street) and responds 24 hours-per-day to all significant fire and rescue incidents in Town. It contains a radio bank and a
command station for use at large scale and long duration incidents. The purchase would include 2 radios in addition to the vehicle, and the
emergency lighting and department identification decal package.
Comments: 
Justification: 
Car 2 is high use and high mileage, and is therefore on an accelerated replacement schedule. The current Car 2 would be repurposed within
the Fire Department fleet and allow the removal of the highest maintenance - oldest SUV from the current fleet.

Description: 
A complete and accurate inventory, and the documentation and understanding of the condition and performance of culverts will be prepared, 
which are key stormwater assets for many roadways and neighborhoods across Framingham.
Comments: 
In addition to being a critical component of roads, the inventory fieldwork and documentation of this small subset of stormwater assets can help
establish standards for the collection of data for other of these assets, and better position Framingham for the long anticipated update to the
MS4 permit. 
Justification: 
Very few culverts (and other stormwater assets) have been addressed in Framingham, far less than for other infrastructure in the last couple
decades. Culverts play a very important role in the conveyance and containment of floodwaters, and the connectivity and preservation of
natural resources and biodiversity. The Town owns approximately 200 culverts from 20 to 100 years old, with most installed prior to current
regulations for flooding reduction and stream crossings. As with other aging infrastructure, deterioration of culverts continues, with repairs, 
rehabilitation or replacement likely to soon become critical for an unknown number of them and the related road(s).
To know what’s required, DPW needs information to forecast remaining service life, and a plan to address any deficiencies found, including
integration with the related roadway needs. That includes an assessment of potential failures and the effects on traffic, public safety, property
damage, flood fighting, emergency construction and others. This will assist in prioritizing capital investments, as well as qualifying and
positioning for funding from agencies such as FEMA, MassDOT, and DCR who have annually provided funding opportunities for culvert
enhancements.

Re: FY-2019 Capital Improvements
Culvert Inventory & Assessment
Dear Mr. Johnson, 
The Town of Framingham owns approximately 190 culverts that range in age from 20 to 100 years old. Most
culverts in Town were built previous to and do not meet current FEMA regulations for flood mitigation or state
stream crossing standards. VHB has prepared this letter to provide a description and cost estimate for the
inventory and assessment of the Town’s existing culverts. 
The DPW is in need of an evaluation of the condition and performance of existing culverts, a means to forecast
their remaining service life, and a plan to address any deficiencies found. A proactive assessment of culverts will
help the Town extend the service life of these culverts and prevent potential failures, which potentially have
significant impacts on traffic, public safety, and property damage. An updated culvert inventory and assessment
will assist the Town with prioritizing capital investment in improvements. 
The total costs associated with the culvert inventory and assessment of the Town’s existing culverts is estimated
to be $175,000.00. 
If you have any questions, or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me. 
Sincerely, 
Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc.

Description: 
These funds will be used to purchase a F450 4x4 Crew Cab Dump Truck to replace a 2007 Ford F450 Regular Cab Dump Truck with 84,999
miles, equating to 127,499 engine miles. 
Comments: 
Justification: 
The Parks Maintenance Department has a limited amount of vehicles within its fleet to support the operational demands. This vehicle, listed
within our fleet as Truck 12, is a F450 Regular Cab Dump Truck used to transport staff and equipment on a daily basis with additional tool
storage capacities (two large tool boxes attached to truck).  Due to its current condition and limited operating capacity, this vehicle is not able to
be utilized to its full potential. As a result, Truck 12 has been relegated to minimal daily usage. 
The vehicle has sustained major rust damage to its truck bed that is costly or beyond repair. During the winter months, Truck 12 has been
used in snow removal/treatment operations. As part of this, Truck 12 carries a bed-mounted sander during these months to treat Town
properties. As a result of operating in support of snow removal efforts during the past 10 years, this vehicle has sustained significant salt
erosion to its frame and bed mounts. Recently, this damage has resulted in multiple holes within the trucks frame and body, rendering Truck
12 incapable of continuing in this capacity. 
In addition to these deficiencies, Truck 12 will also require the following repairs to remain in operation: 
• Replacement of both sets of rear springs;
• Replacement of ball joints;
• Replacement of shifter cable and assembly;
• Replacement of shocks;
• Replacement of rotted break lines;
• Replacement of tie-rod ends.
After 10 years of operational service, the overall physical and mechanical condition of Truck 12 is significantly degraded, requiring
replacement.

RE: Capital Budget Vehicle Replacement — 2007 Ford F450 Regular Cab Dump
Truck
Chris,
As requested, the following is a description of the current issues with the 2007 Ford F450 4Y4 Regular
Cab Dump Truck. Currently, this vehicle has 84,999 miles on the odometer.
Due to the age of this vehicle and current condition, it is utilized minimally on a daily basis. Current
issues requiring attention, labor and expense are:
• Replacement of both sets of rear springs;
• Replacement of ball joints;
• Replacement of shifter cable and assembly;
• Replacement of shocks;
• Replacement of rotted break lines;
• Replacement oftie-rod ends.
During the winter months, Truck 12 has been used in snow removal/treatment operations. As
part of this, Truck 12 carries abed-mounted sander during these months to treat Town properties.
As a result of operating in support of snow removal efforts during the past 10 years, this vehicle
has sustained significant salt erosion to its frame and bed mounts. Recently, this damage has
resulted in multiple holes within the trucks frame and body, rendering Truck 12 incapable of
continuing in this capacity.
After 10 years ofoperationalservice, the overall physical and mechanical condition ofthe vehicle is
significantly degraded. Based on an overall assessment of the vehicle, I believe it has reached its
useful life expectancy and would recommend replacement.

Donald Capen

• Hardware
• Signage
• Bathrooms
• Knobs
• Door Handles
• Design for Compliance
Justification: 
Each year we address architectural barriers that exist at multiple school buildings and sites Although we have performed many upgrades over
the past twelve years, there continues to be items such as door & room signs, door handles, toilet partitions and walk ways that need to be
upgraded so they are compliant. Areas such as school courtyards require ramps; toilet rooms require proper clearance to provide proper
access in some of them. 
As in the past, the Town Unit Pricing Contracts will be utilized for sidewalk repairs at multiple schools. 
FY20: 
$150,000
FY21 - FY25: 
Continue with ADA upgrades at various schools. 
$ 200,000 each year
Please note that ADA site upgrades must be completed during the months of July and August when students are not in the schools. 
Requested amounts reflect the amount of construction work that can be completed in this short time frame.

2. Upon review of the available electric utility demand information it has been determined that
the existing service experienced a high value of 310.0 kW during the month of July 2016.
The NEC allows the usage of this number taken at 125% to represent the existing connected
load. This number can also be utilized to determine the spare capacity of the existing service.
Taking 290.0 kW at .95 power factor equates to 368.0 amperes; this value at 125% equals
459.0 amperes, therefore the spare capacity of the existing service equals 2,541.0 amperes.
3. The new load representing the addition of the proposed HVAC equipment equals 950.0 kW,
or approximately 1,142.0 amperes. This value is substantially less than the 2,541.0 amperes
previously determined as the spare capacity therefore it will acceptable to add the new
equipment load to the existing service.

Microprocessor Control 
The operation will be accomplished utilizing microprocessor computer logic control. The elevator control program
will be contained in non-volatile, programmable, read only memory. Control will be constructed such that future
alteration in elevator operation may readily be made by altering the read only memory. Safety circuits will be
monitored and controlled by the programmable logic control with redundant protection. The microprocessor logic
will be enclosed in a cabinet. 
Landing System (LSQ) 
The new landing system will utilize a flexible flat metal tape that runs the length of the hoistway. An electronic
magnetic reader box on the car top that will see magnets secured on the tape surface that represent the precise level
of each floor level. This new equipment is a simper design and provides more accurate leveling. 
Hoistway Wiring
We will remove all existing wiring from the hoistway and new wiring will be installed. Multi-conductor type
wiring shall be used in the elevator hoistway. All conductors will be copper and shall be #14 for lighting circuits
and #18 for operating, control and signal circuits. All new duct and trough will be installed in keeping with all
applicable codes. 
Traveling Cables
We will remove the existing traveling cables and install new cables with 10% spares specifically designed for
elevator installations. The cables will be supported Kellum grips. Traveling cables will include shielded telephone
and/or intercom wiring terminating in a terminal box located on the car.

Description: 
The Potter Road School is one of several older schools that contain asbestos that we have identified. Ceilings, floors and pipe coverings above
the ceilings are the next area of priority that should have asbestos containing materials removed. 
Comments: 
In an ongoing effort to address, the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Action (AHERA) and comply with D.E.P. (Department of
Environmental Protection) requirements, the District performs six-month inspections for all suspected asbestos containing materials. Three
year reports are filed through a contracted Industrial Hygienist firm in order for the District to be in full compliance with the D.E.P. AHERA
guidelines for Public Schools. 
Justification: 
Because all asbestos must be removed at some point from all schools, even if the building is to be demolished, take a pro-active approach
and address large common areas of floor tile in corridors etc. that show signs of wear or curled edges. Even though there is no eminent danger
of the material becoming airborne or “friable” we want to remove it before it becomes dangerous. 
Please note that the majority of ACM removal and replacement listed must be completed during the months of July and August when students
are not in the schools. Requested amounts reflect the amount of construction and installation work that can be completed in this short time
frame.

FY19: 
In an ongoing effort to address, the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Action (AHERA) and
comply with D.E.P. (Department of Environmental Protection) requirements, the District
performs six-month inspections for all suspected asbestos containing materials. Three year
reports are filed through a contracted Industrial Hygienist firm in order for the District to be in
full compliance with the D.E.P. AHERA guidelines for Public Schools. 
Any item containing asbestos must be monitored and if found to be in poor condition or in a state
where asbestos particulates may become airborne then it must be repaired or removed. 
Because all asbestos must be removed at some point from all schools, even if the building is to
be demolished, take a pro-active approach and address large common areas of floor tile in
corridors etc. that show signs of wear or curled edges. Even though there is no eminent danger of
the material becoming airborne or “friable” we want to remove it before it becomes dangerous. 
This latest request is a representation of planning ahead and securing the removed material
before it becomes dangerous. 
The Potter Road School is one of several older schools that contain asbestos that we have
identified. Ceilings, floors and pipe coverings above the ceilings are the next area of priority that
should have asbestos containing materials removed. 
$460,000
*** Please note that this abatement work must be completed during the months of July

Department Request

Justification: 
The national fire response standards of the National Fire Protection Association require that the Incident Commander establish a Safety Officer
for all significant incidents. The FFD policies dictate that the Deputy Chief in charge of the Training Division respond to such incidents to
perform the duties of Safety Officer. The response truck used for these purposes is a 2006 Ford F250 pickup with high mileage and
accelerating maintenance costs. This Project would replace the current Safety/Training Officer truck and repurpose the current truck within the
Fire Department fleet to replace a fleet vehicle with the highest mileage/hours. The Safety/Training Officer pick-up is also used to get safety
equipment to significant incidents and transport training equipment used at remote drill locations. The cost of this project includes the cost of a
new radio in addition to the vehicle, and the emergency lighting, cargo protection cap and department identification decal package.

Description: 
This funding request is for neighborhood-wide concept design, final design of a first phase of construction, and 60% design of a second phase, 
which will begin neighborhood and property owner consultation; refine, validate and document project criteria; and identify detailed construction
costs and next steps. 
Comments: 
In addition to addressing the condition of infrastructure, the repairs, replacements and improvements will enhance this residential and small
businesses neighborhood immediately south of Downtown.
Justification: 
Most infrastructure in this neighborhood is in a state of disrepair or inadequacy, including many water mains that are over 100 years old and
have fire flow concerns, frequent flooding due to very little drainage infrastructure, with many roads and sidewalks in very poor condition, and
without disability accessibility. This project proposes to address these needs in an affordable multiphase implementation that will also reduce
disruption to residents, businesses and through-traffic. This project was deferred from the FY2018 request.

(SWPS) to maintain compliance with the federal Levee Safety Program.
Comments: 
Justification: 
The most recent inspection of this facility by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) resulted in a rating of “Minimally Acceptable”, with this
drainage pumping station critical to the prevention of flooding of properties within Saxonville. Not addressing the identified deficiencies will lead
to more costly issues and repairs in the future, and could make Framingham ineligible for future FEMA support and federal funding during
emergency flood events. This project was deferred from the FY2018 requests.

Subject: Saxonville Levee Stormwater Pump Station Rehabilitation Project
FY2019 Funding Letter
Dear Ms. Reis:
The Saxonville Levee Stormwater Pump Station (SSWPS) Rehabilitation Project involves the upgrade and
replacement of the station’s equipment and ancillary systems. The SSWPS was originally constructed
within an easement near Watson Place in Framingham, Massachusetts, as part of an Army Corps of
Engineers flood control project in the late 1970’s to protect the low-lying Saxonville area from flooding
from the Sudbury River.
The station is now in need of upgrades to replace aging equipment and code deficiencies to assure its
readiness in the event of future flooding. Key assets slated for upgrades include the diesel driven engines
and fuel tank, pumps, piping, gates, electrical & HVAC systems, and ancillary components.
Specifically, the upgrades will address the following:
·  Replacement of existing roof.
·  Demolition and replacement of existing fuel tank with a new double-walled fuel tank.
·  Improvements to restore the reliability of the existing diesel driven engines, including new clutch,
radiators, belts, and hoses.
·  Upgrades to the ventilation system to provide six (6) air changes per hour (when station is
occupied) as required by code.
·  Replacement of existing manual louvers with automatic louvers.
·  Replacement and upgrades to all existing electrical components, such as lighting, switches,

Description: 
The Annual Road Program utilizes several different maintenance applications to ensure the appropriate road condition. 
Roadway Resurfacing includes mill and Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) overlay, which is the process of grinding off the top layer of existing asphalt
pavement by means of a large milling machine and replacing this layer with at least two layers of a new HMA riding surface. A leveling course
may be applied prior to the final riding surface to resolve various roadway defects, ensure proper drainage, and provide adequate rideability
throughout the duration of the project. Drainage improvements are made if needed before paving. Curbing is re-laid or replaced if they are in
poor condition or reset for adequate reveal. Sidewalk reconstruction includes ADA handicap ramp upgrades. Signage and traffic marking are
upgraded. Tentative roads scheduled for roadway resurfacing are Fenwick Street, Wickford Road, Sturgis Road, Normandy Road, Sanger
Street, Thompson Street, William Welch Way and Speen Street. 
The Department also utilizes several different Roadway Surface Treatment applications including: 
Rubber chip seal is typically applied to neighborhood roads with low to moderate volume traffic volumes. The treatment is used to provide a
flexible, waterproof wearing surface that seals the existing pavement and is highly resistant to cracking. Installation includes a HMA shim
course to redefine the profile of the road, provide structural stability, and improve rideability. All utility castings are raised to finish grade, 
driveway aprons are adjusted as needed, and a rubber chip seal topcoat is applied. Signage and traffic markings are upgraded. The annual
road program is scheduled to include: Ridgefield Drive, Leonard Road, Lohnes Road, Blackthorn Road, Bantry Road, Rosslare Road, Tara
Road, Poskus Road, Hastings Street, Sunset Drive, Pitt Road, Cavanaugh Road, Fairbanks Road, Fairbanks Way, Highland Court, Murray
Road, Magnolia Street, Michaud Drive, Childs Circle, Woodside Cottage Way, Gil Leonard Road, Wyndstone Way, Highgate Road, and
Crestwood Drive. 
Rubber chip seal can also be used in conjunction with other roadway treatments as a Stress Absorbing Membrane Interlayer (SAMI). The
SAMI seals the roadway and extends its service life. Bonded Wearing Course (or Novachip) can be applied after a SAMI and includes a thin
layer of a polymer modified asphalt emulsion sprayed onto the road surface followed immediately by an overlay of HMA. Castings are raised to
grade and traffic markings are restored. Tentative roads scheduled for this surface treatment application are Salem End Road (partial),
Parmentor Road, and Nixon Road. 
Mill and fill operations are also performed by the Department in conjunction with specialized contracted equipment to address surface defects. 
Mill and fill can be used as a stand-alone roadway maintenance method or can be used in preparation for surface treatment products.
Justification: 
Without substantial ongoing improvements, the roadway system will deteriorate rapidly, and cost more to raise back up to a State of Good
Repair.

Justification: 
All of the existing vehicles being replaced will have exceeded 10 years in service when replaced (and sold), and nearly all are near to or over
100,000 miles or run-hours equivalent. Industry and Framingham DPW experience indicates that above those thresholds maintenance
increases substantially to assure service reliability, as do major repairs, none of which provide a return on investment, and they are not
sustainable with the current DPW facility and staffing. In addition to daily service for the various Divisions, they all are used for the
Department’s snow and ice management program, with many also used to respond to community events and emergencies. Snow plowing is
particularly destructive to vehicles.

Description: 
These funds will be used to purchase a F450 Chip Body Truck to replace a 2000 Ford F450 4x4 Chip Body Truck with 43,495 miles, equating
to 65,243 engine miles. 
Comments: 
Justification: 
The Parks Maintenance Department has a limited amount of vehicles within its fleet to support its operational demands. This vehicle, listed
within our fleet as Truck 16, is a F450 Chip Body Truck used to transport staff and support tree removal/maintenance operations on a daily
basis. 
The vehicle has sustained major rust damage to its frame, necessitating a full body replacement within the past five years. Currently, this
vehicle has number of mechanical issues that will require repair to remain operational within fleet. These include a leaking and failing oil pan
and leaking rear main engine seal, both requiring replacement. In addition to these issues, the vehicle will also require the following repairs to
remain in operation: 
• Replacement of both sets of rear springs;
• Replacement of ball joints;
• Replacement of shifter cable and assembly;
• Replacement of rusted, leaking oil pan and rear main engine seal that requires removal of the engine and transmission;
• Replacement of shocks;
• Replacement of tie-rod ends;
After 18 years of operational service, the overall physical and mechanical condition of Truck 16 is significantly degraded, requiring
replacement.

Memorandum
From the desk of Donald Capen
November 4, 2017
RE: Capital Budget Vehicle Replacement — 2000 Ford F450 4x4 Ghip Body Truck
Chris,
As requested, the following is a description of the current issues with the 2000 Ford F450 4x4 Regular
Chip Body Truck. Currently, this vehicle has 43,495 miles on the odometer.
Due to the age of this vehicle and current condition, it is utilized minimally on a daily basis. Current
issues requiring attention, labor and expense are:
• Replacement of both sets of rear springs;
• Replacement of ball joints;
• Replacement of shifter cable and assembly;
• Replacement of rusted, leaking oil pan and rear main engine seal that
requires removal of the engine and transmission;
• Replacement of shocks;
• Replacementoftie-rod ends;
Currently, this vehicle has number of mechanical issues that will require repair to remain
operational within fleet. These include a leaking and failing oil pan and leaking rear main engine
seal, both requiring replacement.
After 18 years ofoperational service, the overall physical and mechanical condition ofthe vehicle is
significantly degraded. Based on an overall assessment of the vehicle, I believe it has reached its
useful life expectancy and would recommend replacement.
Regards,
Donald Capen

This vehicle, listed within our fleet as Truck 22, is a Kubota Tractor that is used to maintain fields on a daily basis. This tractor contains the
ability to serve as a backhoe, fertilizer applicator, aerator, rototiller and front end loader. Due to the amount of engine hours accrued by the
tractor, it is a major risk of failing, which would cause significant setbacks to the daily operational needs of the Parks Maintenance Department. 
In addition to the age and amount of usage this tractor has experienced, the tractor will also require the following repairs to remain in operation: 
• Replacement of front bucket assembly bushings and grease fittings;
• Rebuilding of front bucket valve body;
• Replacement of cab;
In addition to these concerns and deficiencies, the evolving operational environment is requiring the need for an additional tractor with multiple
use functions. Currently, there are two Kubota Tractors (1997 & 2006) within fleet. During the height of seasonal operations, there is
continually a gap in service due to the rising need for these tractors and limited inventory. By purchasing this Kubota, we will be able to
adequately meet the operational needs of the Maintenance Department in management of over 550 acres of Town/City Property.

Memorandum
From the desk of Donald Capen
November 4, 2017
RE: Capital Budget Vehicle Replacement — 1997 Kubota Tractor L4740
Chris,
As requested, the following is a description of the current issues with the 1997 Kubota Tractor.
Currently, this vehicle has 96,495 engine miles.
Due to the amount of engine hours accrued by the tractor, it is a major• risk of failing, which would
cause significant setbacks to the daily operational needs of the Parks Maintenance Department.
Current issues requiring attention, labor and expense are:
Replacement of front bucket assembly bushings and grease fittings;
Rebuilding of front bucket valve body;
Replacement of cab;
After 21 years of operational service, the overall physical and mechanical condition of the vehicle is
significantly degraded. Based on an overall assessment of the vehicle, I believe it has reached its
useful life expectancy and would recommend replacement.
Regards,
Donald Capen

Description: 
Demolish and replace various size chain link fence, gates, and guardrail at various parks properties.
Comments:

Main 2019 
Department Request
Yes 
Justification: 
Properly maintained vertical structures at park facilities have a dramatic impact on overall neighborhood culture and public safety. Properly
maintained parks are integral to neighborhood beautification, stabilization, site usability, public safety, and maintaining surrounding property
values. The Board of Selectmen Vision Statement indicates "Our Town will foster a sense of pride by placing a high priority on quality
education, neighborhood parks ... and promote a clean and beautiful Town." The "Choose Framingham" initiative identifies the fact that "the
average distance to a playground or other recreation area from any single family parcel is approximately a quarter of a mile." As such, by
replacing fence and backstops at park locations we are able to continue on forwarding not only the Board of Selectmen’s Vision Statement but
also continue to build neighborhood pride in local parks. 
In addition to maintaining neighborhood parks and other passive recreational facilities throughout the Town, the Parks, Recreation & Cultural
Affairs Division also maintains three cemeteries (Edwards Cemetery, Old South Burial Grounds, Main Street Cemetery).  Parks staff members
have identified needed replacement of various fence lines at these three cemeteries. Normal aging, tree damage and the need for fencing
placement has resulted in identifying these three locations for improvements. 
Phase 3 of the Fence and Backstop Replacement program includes improvements at the following Parks & Recreation maintained properties:
* Removal and replacement of chain link installations at Main Street Cemetery
* Removal and replacement of chain link installations at Old South Cemetery
* Removal of chain link installations and replacement consisting of wooden guardrail at Edwards Cemetery
* Removal and replacement of telephone stump fencing at Winch Tennis Courts
* Removal and replacement of oversized backstop at Charlotte Dunning Softball Field

Comments: 
Service performance, pride of service and community support are all emphasized by DPW, with vehicle cleanliness an important expression of
those, and a responsibility of DPW staff. 
Justification: 
All of the existing vehicles being replaced will have exceeded 10 years in service when replaced (and sold), and nearly all are near to or over
100,000 miles or run-hours equivalent. Industry and Framingham DPW experience indicates that above those thresholds maintenance
increases substantially to assure service reliability, as do major repairs, none of which provide a return on investment, and they are not
sustainable with the current DPW facility and staffing. In addition to daily service for the various Divisions, they all are used for the
Department’s snow and ice management program, with many also used to respond to community events and emergencies. Snow plowing is
particularly destructive to vehicles.

Justification: 
The lifespan and reliability of these stations can be extended a decade or more through the replacement of component parts as they become
worn and inefficient, thereby reducing the near-term need for significant capital funds. For example, underground controls and Supervisory
Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems may be considered to be raised above ground for reduction of corrosion and for safety
purposes.

Description: 
The overall project is to line or replace water and sewer mains between Concord Street and the Natick town line, as well as the cross-country
sewer connector that runs north from Worcester Road through Natick, terminating near Cochituate Road. This work is to be designed and
constructed in three sections (I – Rt 9 eastbound lanes, including the Pierce and Dinsmore neighborhoods; II – Westbound lanes; III – north-
south sewer connector), with this request for the construction of Phase I, and the final design of II and III.
Comments: 
Approval and coordination with MassDOT, particularly in minimizing traffic disruptions, and coordination with a large number of businesses and
residences are important aspects of this multiple year construction project. Approval and coordination with the Framingham and Natick
Conservation Commissions are needed for Phase III. 
Justification: 
The need for this project are some undersized pipes, pipe age and materials, condition, and the consequences of their failure, with this
investment increasing capacity, reliability and fire flow, and reducing maintenance costs. Most of this infrastructure is between 50 and 100
years old, and they serve major portions of Framingham’s retail businesses, where emergency repairs and the disruption of service and traffic
would be very costly. The cross-country connector traverses wetlands, which make maintenance access and emergency repairs extremely
difficult, costly and damaging to the natural resources, especially during wet periods.

Description: 
This work will continue Phase 1 (south of Waverly) implementation of “No Dig” lining repairs (aka trenchless), extending into the area between
Waverly Street and Worcester Road/Route 9. Investigations and planning will also be performed for the necessary, and more expensive and
disruptful “Dig” repairs in the Phases 1 and 2 areas, and a coordinated plan developed for implementing those repairs, likely as part of a Phase
3 Defects Repairs effort in FY2020. 
Comments: 
This work, and the anticipated Phase 3 Defects Repairs may be performed as part of a distinct capital project, with other capital projects, by an
On-call contractor, and/or by Operations staff. 
Justification: 
Framingham has studied 50% of its sewer system focused on identifying high priority sewer repairs that would reduce infiltration, as well as
extend the reliable service life of sewer system assets. Infiltration reduces the capacity for sewage flow, can result in back ups and overflows, 
and increases the billings from MWRA, which is based on total sewer flow from Framingham. Phase 1 repairs were implemented in late 2017
for defects at and south of Waverly Street, with only “No Dig” lining performed to date, since they could be implemented more rapidly, at less
cost, and none of the surface disruptions with “Dig” repairs or replacements.

Justification: 
Pipes downstream of sewer pump stations have increased risk of failure and need for maintenance, wetlands are a common source of
infiltration into pipes, and a failure under the highway could be catastrophic. Replacement of this 60 year old asbestos cement pipe will address
these issues and provide reliable service for many decades. This project was deferred from the FY2018 requests.

Reference: Woodland PS Force Main Realignment Project
Annual Town Meeting Funding Request
Dear Ms. Reis.
In conjunction with the preliminary engineering services for the Woodland Pump Station Force
Main Realignment project under Task Order #7 of our MSA with the Framingham DPW, Stantec
prepared a Preliminary Opinion of Probable Construction Cost. This letter serves as backup for the
Annual Town Meeting funding appropriation on the total project.
The Woodland PS Force Main Realignment will eliminate the crossing of the existing 10" asbestos
cement(AC) force under the MassPike and replace it with a new 10" PVC pressure pipeline that
will start at the Woodland Pump Station and proceed along the northern side of the MassPike
right-of-way(offthe travel way) to the intersection with Edgell Road for a distance of
approximately 1,100 feet. The proposed new force main would then turn south on Edgell Road
crossing under the MassPike overpass for an approximate distance of 700 feet to connect back
into the existing 10" AC force main.
This project will address the Town's goals of improvements to public infrastructure and protection
of the environment. The existing 10" AC force main has experienced a collapse requiring
emergency repairs be made. Since the force main crosses under the MassPike, access for
maintenance and repairs is very limited making it difficult to address future problems that may
arise. The deteriorating condition of the AC pipe also increases the risk of releasing raw sewage to
the nearby stream and wetlands should another failure occur. The proposed replacement PVC
force main provides much improved access and protection against pipe failure and release to
the environment.
We recommend a total appropriation for the project of $1,735,000.

Description: 
This project will construct a replacement siphon in a jacked steel casing pipe under the aqueduct that meets current design standards, 
including redundancy and improved access for maintenance. It will also provide for a future non-siphon (gravity) configuration if the sewer
elevation is lowered on Waveney and Pleasant Streets. 
Comments: 
The work will conform to recent area roadway improvements. 
Justification: 
The existing single barrel siphon under the MWRA Weston Aqueduct has inadequate access for maintenance and does not meet current
design standards for inverted sewer siphons, requiring frequent bypass pumping and maintenance in order to assure flow from 500 homes and
prevent sewer backups. This project was deferred from the FY2018 requests.

Comments: 
Service performance, pride of service and community support are all emphasized by DPW, with vehicle cleanliness an important expression of
those, and a responsibility of DPW staff. 
Justification: 
All of the existing vehicles being replaced will have exceeded 10 years in service when replaced (and sold), and nearly all are near to or over
100,000 miles or run-hours equivalent. Industry and Framingham DPW experience indicates that above those thresholds maintenance
increases substantially to assure service reliability, as do major repairs, none of which provide a return on investment, and they are not
sustainable with the current DPW facility and staffing. In addition to daily service for the various Divisions, they all are used for the
Department’s snow and ice management program, with many also used to respond to community events and emergencies. Snow plowing is
particularly destructive to vehicles.

Description: 
The overall project is to line or replace water and sewer mains between Concord Street and the Natick town line, as well as the cross-country
sewer connector that runs north from Worcester Road through Natick, terminating near Cochituate Road. This work is to be designed and
constructed in three sections (I – Rt 9 eastbound lanes, including the Pierce and Dinsmore neighborhoods; II – Westbound lanes; III – north-
south sewer connector), with this request for the construction of Phase I, and the final design of II and III. 
Comments: 
See related sewer main project.
Approval and coordination with MassDOT, particularly in minimizing traffic disruptions, and coordination with a large number of businesses and
residences are important aspects of this multiple year construction project. Approval and coordination with the Framingham and Natick
Conservation Commissions are needed for Phase III. 
Justification: 
The need for this project are some undersized pipes, pipe age and materials, condition, and the consequences of their failure, with this
investment increasing capacity, reliability and fire flow, and reducing maintenance costs. Most of this infrastructure is between 50 and 100
years old, and they serve major portions of Framingham’s retail businesses, where emergency repairs and the disruption of service and traffic
would be very costly. The cross-country connector traverses wetlands, which make maintenance access and emergency repairs extremely
difficult, costly and damaging to the natural resources, especially during wet periods.

RE: FY19 Planning Level Cost Estimate
Worcester Road Water and Sewer Mains (East of Concord St) –Phase I Construction, and
Phases II and III Design
Dear Mr. Rogers: 
This letter confirms the need for funding for the following project: 
Worcester Road Water and Sewer Mains (East of Concord St) –Phase I Construction, and
Phases II and III Design
Opinion of design and construction budget: $5,700,000 (water) 
$3,800,000 (sewer) 
Total: $9,500,000
Description: 
This three-phased project will upgrade and improve the reliability of water and sewer systems on
Worcester Road between Concord Street and the Natick town line. Sewers and water mains will be
replaced or relined on Worcester Road itself, and the downstream sewer interceptor that currently
runs northward through Natick and a major isolated wetland will be replaced with a new interceptor
that runs along accessible roadways. This work will be designed and constructed in three sections: 
Phase I – Rt 9 eastbound lanes, including the Pierce and Dinsmore neighborhoods; Phase II –
Westbound lanes; and Phase III – new rerouted sewer interceptor. The funding request is for the
construction of Phase I, and the final design of Phases II and III. 
Justification and Comments: 
This project is needed because sewers and water mains are undersized and prone to failure as a result
of their age and materials, and failures to infrastructure could cause major economic impacts to the
businesses and residents in the service area. Most of this infrastructure is between 50 and 100 years
old, and the service area includes major portions of Framingham’s retail businesses and large
apartment complexes, where emergency repairs and the disruption of service and traffic would be
very costly and affect quality of the lives of many during outages. The cross-country connector
traverses wetlands, which make maintenance access and emergency repairs very costly, extremely
difficult, and potentially damaging to the natural resources, especially during wet periods. 
This multi-year construction project requires approval and coordination with MassDOT, particularly
in minimizing traffic disruptions, and coordination with a large number of businesses and residences. 
Phase III will require approval and coordination with the Framingham and Natick Conservation
Commissions.

Re: Arlington Street Area Infrastructure Phases 1 and 1B Design
Mr. Rogers, 
This letter confirms the need for $520,000 from the General Fund, and $90,000 from/for Sewer in funding
for the following project: 
Project
Arlington Street Area Infrastructure Phases 1 and 1B – Design
Summary Description: 
Investigations into the replacement of the ca. 1885 water main in Arlington Street revealed the need to
replace not only that water main, but sewer mains also, and almost all other key infrastructure assets in
the vicinity. It’s now been determined that most infrastructure in the South Framingham neighborhoods
bound by Hollis Street, Irving Street, Beaver Dam Brook, and the southern CSX rail yard are in various
states of disrepair or inadequacy, including other water mains with reduced fire flow and a high risk of
breaks. Addressing them all in a coordinated fashion will reduce the total cost, including for emergency
repairs. 
Noteworthy in the area is the inadequate and poor condition of drainage systems, both on and serving
private development, and the very limited amount of roadway drainage, resulting in frequent flooding at a
number of locations. Though no direct damage appears to be a result of that flooding, poor roadway
drainage commonly shortens the life of pavement. Also, apparent solutions to the flooding will require
excavation alongside, over and under water and sewer lines, with a least total cost solution likely involving
adjustments of one or more of the other infrastructure in the area, particularly in the relatively narrow
roads where new gas lines were installed in 2016. 
Numerous high priority sewer defects have been identified in this area, with cracks, breaks, gaps and
infiltration into the pipes and manholes. In addition to the cost of conveying and treating infiltrating
water, these conditions are indicative of a high risk of failure, and the need for greater maintenance due
to roots, debris and other clogging. 
Existing roads in the vicinity range from good to very poor condition (Pratt, Campbell and Hearth), with
nearly all sidewalks in at least poor condition. As with many areas in Framingham, there are also many
barriers to ADA accessibility.

A September 2017 “Arlington Street Improvements Study Report” evaluated and provided
recommendations to improve drainage, reduce stormwater flooding, and a plan to repair or replace aging
infrastructure such as water and sewer systems, pavement, curbs and sidewalks in the Project area. The
study report included: 
•  Identification of a preferred alternative
•  Phasing analysis
•  Construction cost estimate
•  Recommendations for next steps
The study recommended the project include three (3) construction phases to minimize disturbance to
residents, businesses and through traffic, and allow the Town to budget for construction over multiple
years. Recommendations for next steps included: 
•  Concept design of the entire area
•  Design of phase 1 of the project to bid documents
•  Design of drainage upgrades upstream of phase 1 to 60% design (referred to as Phase 1B)
•  Additional hydrologic/hydraulic analysis to estimate impacts on Beaver Dam Brook
Justification: 
Most infrastructure in this neighborhood is in a state of disrepair or inadequacy, including many water
mains that are over 100 years old and have fire flow concerns, frequent flooding due to very little
drainage infrastructure, with many roads and sidewalks in very poor condition, and without disability
accessibility. This project proposes to address these needs in an affordable multiphase implementation
that will also reduce disruption to residents, businesses and through-traffic. This project was deferred
from the FY2018 request. 
Key Assets (Phase 1 and 1B):
6,900 LF roadway to be rehabbed or replaced
14,000 LF sidewalk to be replaced or improved
5,200 LF drain pipes to be new (most), rehabbed or replaced
4,500 LF sewer main to be lined or replaced
4,500 LF water main to be replaced, with some potentially lined

Re: FY-2018 Capital Improvements
Arlington Street Road Area, Sidewalk and Stormwater Improvements - Design
Mr. Johnson, 
VHB has prepared this letter to provide a description and cost estimate for the design efforts required
for sidewalk and storm water improvements in the Arlington Street area. 
The South Framingham neighborhoods bound by Hollis Street, Irving Street, Beaver Dam Brook, and the 
southern CSX rail yard includes infrastructure in various states of disrepair.  This area contains some of 
the oldest water pipes some in Town.  Replacement is need to both mitigate the high risk of water main 
breaks and to improve fire flow.   The area also suffers from inadequate storm water collection and 
disposal infrastructure, and the adjacencies among all of the subsurface utility infrastructure support a 
program to replace all needed elements together. 
Initial analysis will be performed to identify storm drain improvements needed in the area, and the 
project will develop the potential/likely phased implementation of water, sewer, road, storm and 
sidewalk improvements (likely in 3 to 5 phases/years), with goals of addressing them all in a least‐cost 
and least disruptive manner to residents, businesses and through‐traffic. The project will include the 
design and associated survey of a first phase of infrastructure improvements in the Arlington Street. 
This project follows the principle of renewing aged sub-surface utilities, while making needed roadway
and sidewalk improvements, in a way that minimized total capital cost as well as limiting disruption to
residents, businesses and traffic. 
The total cost associated with the design of Arlington Street sidewalk and storm water improvements is
estimated to be $350,000.

Description: 
This project is for investigations and design of the replacement and lining of aged and distressed sewer mains along the Central Street corridor
(Highgate to Purchase). Existing sections across private properties and along the river shoreline will be relocated to the road right of way
wherever reasonable. Investigations will be performed on the sewer lines discharging into this main, particularly those that are asbestos
cement pipe (ACP), or are suspected to be large infiltration or inflow sources.
Comments: 
Much of the investigations and survey can and will be used for the water mains in the corridor (design funding authorized at the 2017 ATM, 
with that survey also used for the anticipated future road design). A significant amount of ACP is likely to be removed. 
Justification: 
In addition to their age and extensive sections observed to be in poor condition, with likely infiltration and high risk of failures and back ups, 
annual jetting and root intrusion treatment are required to assure function, with access for that work made difficult and costly where on private
properties and along the shoreline. This project was deferred from the FY2018 requests.

Description: 
This study and preliminary design is expected to result in the replacement of 2 small and outdated pump stations (Flanagan and McQuinn) with
deep gravity sewers, and the needed improvements to the downstream Pleasant Street station, as well as the replacement or lining of 2 miles
of sewer, and the removal of 1,100 feet of asbestos cement pipe (ACP).
Comments: 
See the related water mains project. Increased cost efficiencies will result when sharing surveyed basemapping, and designing needed water
main replacements in the same sections of roads. 
Justification: 
All 3 pump stations are in need of overhaul or replacement, as are many of the sewer mains, and a 2016 study indicates the cost effectiveness
of this plan, with further investigation and refined study to confirm or modify that, and provide direction for the subsequent design. The
Lanewood Avenue siphon under the MWRA aqueduct that is downstream of McQuinn could be eliminated also, further reducing maintenance
needs and the risk of back ups.

Comments: 
Service performance, pride of service and community support are all emphasized by DPW, with vehicle cleanliness an important expression of
those, and a responsibility of DPW staff. 
Justification: 
All of the existing vehicles being replaced will have exceeded 10 years in service when replaced (and sold), and nearly all are near to or over
100,000 miles or run-hours equivalent. Industry and Framingham DPW experience indicates that above those thresholds maintenance
increases substantially to assure service reliability, as do major repairs, none of which provide a return on investment, and they are not
sustainable with the current DPW facility and staffing. In addition to daily service for the various Divisions, they all are used for the
Department’s snow and ice management program, with many also used to respond to community events and emergencies. Snow plowing is
particularly destructive to vehicles.

Description: 
This project will provide a 2,800 foot new water main from Bates Road Extension to Thayer Street, using the existing sewer easement on CSX
property and another that extends east from Thayer Street.
Comments: 
Justification: 
Currently, a single 8-inch cast iron water main installed in 1910 feeds the entire neighborhood. Providing a redundant water service (loop) to
the neighborhood east of Waushakum Pond, at the Ashland town line, will reduce risks associated with potential failure of the water main on
Hollis Street and will improve water quality.

This funding request is for design of the replacement of 14,000 feet of water mains, including surveyed base mapping. 
Comments: 
See related Pleasant St Area Sewers and Pump Stations.
Justification: 
The water mains along these streets require replacement due to their age, condition, size and materials, and will be less costly if constructed at
the same time as the planned sewer repairs and replacements in Pleasant Street. All are more than 7 decades old, some are substandard 6-
inch diameter, and some are asbestos cement, with the unlined cast iron water mains having interior tuberculation and corrosion that results in
decreased capacity. Replacement will assure adequate flow and substantially increase reliability of the water system in this area.

Dear Mr. Rogers, 
Reference: Pleasant Street/Temple Street Water Mains - Designs 
This letter confirms the need for $825,000 in funding for the design of the replacement of 14,000
feet of water mains, including surveyed base mapping for Pleasant Street and Temple Street. 
Pleasant Street and the northern end of Temple Street have 8-inch and 6-inch diameter water
mains that are unlined cast iron installed around 1920 and asbestos cement (AC) installed in 1939, 
all of which are near the end of their anticipated service life. The cast iron pipe has interior
tuberculation and corrosion, with reduced flow capacity and service reliability, and the asbestos
cement pipe deteriorates more quickly than other types of pipe. The August 2017 Draft Water
System Master Plan Report identified Pleasant Street as a critical water main needing high priority
improvement to address unlined cast iron mains. Replacement will restore capacity to the water
system in this area and improve reliability. 
The project extent is along Pleasant from the west end of the AC pipe (between Waveney and
Pine Hill Roads, near 1000 Pleasant Street) to Worcester Road, and the section of Temple Street
water main from Pleasant Street to the Mass Pike, which is approximately 14,000 linear feet of new
8-inch ductile iron pipe. The project will also include replacement of all water services to the curb
stops, and hydrants. 
It is anticipated that design for this work would begin in June 2019 and would have a duration of
one year.

Comments: 
See related construction of this project anticipated for FY2020. 
This is one of the last remaining century-old water mains in the 9/90 and Tech Park areas.
Justification: 
This water main requires replacement due to age, condition and material, with the unlined cast iron pipe more than 10 decades old, and both
interior tuberculation and exterior corrosion that result in decreased capacity and reliability. Replacement will assure adequate flow and

Dear Mr. Rogers, 
Reference: Worcester Road (9/90) Water Main - Design 
This letter confirms the need for $135,000 in funding for the design of the 1,700 foot water main
water main replacement along the south side of Worcester Road, west of the Massachusetts
Turnpike, or potential lining rehabilitation, including surveyed base mapping. 
The 1,700 linear foot water main in Worcester Road between Crossing Boulevard and
Massachusetts Turnpike (Interstate 90) overpass consists of 8-inch diameter unlined cast iron water
main installed ca. 1900 that is at the end of its anticipated service life. The cast iron has a buildup
of interior tuberculation and corrosion, which results in reduced flow capacity. The Draft Water
System Master Plan Report dated August 2017 identified Worcester Road as a critical water main
needing high priority improvement to address unlined cast iron mains. The Worcester Road area
supports a key commercial area of the Town. Replacement will restore capacity to the water
system in this area and improve reliability. The project includes replacement of all water services to
the curb stops, and hydrants. 
It is anticipated that design for this work would begin in June 2019 and would have a duration of
one year.
