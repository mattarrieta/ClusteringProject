WHEREAS, many Framingham immigrant residents fear that calling 911, speaking to the police, or
appearing in Framingham Court hearings will lead to separation from family members —especially their
children —making these residents more vulnerable to domestic abuse, wage theft, and other crimes;
WHEREAS, in order to increase immigrant participation in the 2020 Census, we need to create a positive
and safe environment to encourage higher rates of response to this national survey;
WHEREAS, in the past, the Town of Framingham approved resolutions to address these issues and because
we are now a city, it is imperative that we adopt a clear immigrant policy that can continue to build trust
between immigrants, the City administration and City departments;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Framingham City Council approves the formation of a Task
Force responsible for writing a Framingham Welcoming Immigrants Ordinance that reflects the needs of
our population, with the following composition:
