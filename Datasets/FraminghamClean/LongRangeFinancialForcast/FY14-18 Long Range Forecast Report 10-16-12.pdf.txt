Executive Summary
”The goal of forecasting is not to predict the future but to tell what you need to know to take
meaningful action in the present.”1

The purpose of a Long Range Forecast is to provide Administrators, Committees, Town Meeting, and
Taxpayers with important data regarding the finances of the Town. This forecast includes the General
Fund which is funded by property taxes, state aid, local taxes, revenues from departments and other
revenue. The expenditures included are all Town department operations (including education) and all
fixed costs (insurances, retirement, debt service and state assessments).  The forecast is a tool to aid in
making decisions for future investment in operations, programs, services and infrastructure. It is not
the budget; it is information to help make budget choices. 
The Long Range Forecast (LRF) assumes growth of existing programs and services and existing revenues. 
There is no expansion of programs or services from the FY13 base, simply normal rates of growth. 
Revenues assume no new revenue sources or types; the only “new” revenue is new growth in property
taxes due to new development. The new growth estimate is based on an overall level of
development/redevelopment happening in Town. Revenues assume no increase in any particular fee. 
For FY15 to FY18, there are still deficits. This forecast assumes a gradual reduction of the allocation of
free cash to the operating budget. The substantial increase in education aid that occurred in FY13 is not
expected to be repeated during this forecast. Significant changes to employee health insurance coverage
effective March 1, 2012 have reduced that FY13 and FY14 cost. However, the annual rate of increase still
outpaces the growth in revenue. Debt service is forecast based on the Town’s long term Capital Budget. 
This assumes that all of the capital projects requested are approved; the reduction of capital
authorizations has been a source of budget reduction that has often closed the operating budget gap
from year to year. 
The Town’s pension fund contribution must increase at a 5% annual rate to be fully funded by 2030. 
There is also the OPEB future benefits liability, which will require annual appropriations in the near
term. Recent changes to the costs that fuel this liability should reduce the total unfunded liability. This
forecast allocates funds from free cash to the OPEB trust fund. 
In addition to our known obligations, both funded and unfunded, the Town has an obligation to invest
in its services. There are unmet needs in education and public safety, facility maintenance and economic
development that must also fit into the finances of the Town. 
Future Revenue Projections: 2014 to 2018
A detailed table of the revenue forecast is included on Chart 2, page 16. It lists each revenue source by
major category, broken down into subcategories. Each subcategory has a rate of growth listed to the
right of the individual source. 
Global General Fund revenue is projected to increase in the 3% range for the term of this forecast. The
increase is 3.2% in FY14 and as high as 3.5% in FY17. The components of revenue and its share of the
total “pie” are presented in the following pie charts:

Property taxes
Property taxes are projected to increase by 2.5% per year as restricted by Proposition 2 1/2. The rule is
that the total tax levy from the prior year is multiplied by 2.5% to get the maximum next year levy. The
total levy of the prior year includes the base tax levy, plus the taxable amount of new growth in value. 
The 2.5% increase for FY14 is from the FY13 base which increased by only 1.5% from FY12. There
remains a 1% difference between what is the maximum taxable levy and what the Town has actually
built into the budget for taxes in FY13. That excess levy capacity from FY13 is NOT built into any other
fiscal year. For the term of the forecast beyond FY14 the projected revenue assumes going to the
maximum levy increase (2.5%) every single year, and still we will have a deficit. New growth, those
taxes generated by new development, is added on top of the tax levy in its initial year and then folded
into the base levy in subsequent years. For the next few years there appears to be growth only in
Technology Park and redevelopment at the TJX property. Therefore, new growth is reduced for the
beginning of this forecast, growing by 4% for the next two years. However, there is increased growth of
9% and 7% in FY16 and FY17 anticipating the completion of redevelopment at TJX and the decrease in
that Tax Increment Financing (TIF) agreement in subsequent years. 
There is no assumption of changes to telecommunication tax exemptions. The state has not closed the
loophole for telecommunication equipment. If the loophole was closed, Framingham would gain $1.5
million in personal property taxes. 
State Aid
State aid is the least predictable of the revenue sources. From FY11 to FY12 it increase just under $1.9
million; yet from FY12 to FY13 it increase $6.7 million. The amount of funding depends upon state
revenue amounts and is distributed via complicated state formulas. It is also subject to political
manipulation; reallocating funds to politically powerful cities and towns at the expense of less powerful 
3

ones. State Aid for Framingham consists of Chapter 70 Education Aid, the largest component; 
Unrestricted General Government Aid, Charter School Reimbursements, payments for loss of property
tax for state owned land, and reimbursements for tax exemptions for Veterans, the elderly and surviving
spouses of each. In Framingham, it also includes reimbursement of debt service by the School Building
Authority in the amount of $2,510,995 for the next five years. The forecast assumes an increase in
Chapter 70 aid ranging from 8% in FY14 to 7% in FY18. This is a lower rate of growth from the prior
forecast primarily because the state legislature increased Chapter 70 aid by 21% in FY13 in an effort to
rectify formula shortfalls more quickly. This means that future years will see smaller increases. As you
can see from the graph below the health of the overall economy, which affects state revenue collections, 
also has an influence on the amount of state aid. General Government Aid increases by little over 1% in
FY14-FY16 and 5% in FY17 and FY18. State owned land payments increase by 2% for the first three
years of the forecast and 5% for the remaining. The remaining components of state aid stay level for the
term of the forecast.

Local Receipts
Local receipts are fees, user charges, local taxes, rent, investment income and fines created and/or
controlled by the municipality. The Town collects three taxes: motor vehicle excise, 6% room tax and
.75% meals tax. The excise tax actually decreases over time. The room and meals tax will hold steady. 
Just .5% growth in this revenue type is projected for FY14 while growth in the subsequent years is 1%.
User fees, penalties and fines and licenses and permits grow at 3%, 2% and 4% respectively. Investment
income is projected to increase by 4% this year after a severe reduction last year. The remaining
revenue sources within Local Receipts remain steady for FY13 and beyond with the exception of rentals
and pilot. Over the course of the forecast total local receipts grow by a mere 1.7% in FY14 and
decreases by 3.3% in FY18 due to the anticipated drop in rental and pilot revenue from Mass Bay
Community College as the lease of the Farley School comes to an end.

Overhead Charges to Enterprise Funds 
State regulation allows a municipality to charge other funds for the overhead costs to manage the
programs and the finances of the specific fund. The charges must be proportional to the level of effort
spent by staff and managers and the direct costs of overhead expenses. The Town created a computer
model that calculates salaries, operating costs, insurances and legal costs that are dedicated to managing
the water and sewer departments. This model is reviewed periodically for accuracy and the amounts
adjusted for the annual increase in costs. The rate of growth for this forecast is 3%.  The indirect
charges provide $2.8 million in revenue to the General Fund in FY14 and grow to almost $3.2 million in
FY18. 
Free Cash
Free cash is the amount of money left over and unrestricted in the General Fund at the end of the fiscal
year. The Town’s policy for the use of free cash allows the use of up to $1.5 million for the operating
budget in the next budget cycle (i.e. FY12 free cash is used in the FY14 budget).  The remaining amount
of free cash is then allocated to the Stabilization Fund (40%), capital projects (20%) and to remain in
General Fund balance (40%).  This does not necessarily mean there will be funds available for all of
these allocations. In FY09 there was only $1.2 million of free cash available, so no funds were allocated
for the stabilization fund or capital projects or to remain in the fund balance, we used it all to fund the
budget. The most recent Moody’s rating review stated that the Town’s reliance on the use of free cash
as a revenue source for the operating budget is a negative factor in its evaluation of the credit
worthiness of the Town. In this forecast we begin the phase out of the use of free cash for general fund
operations. The $1.5 million allocation is reduced by $200,000 per year, leaving $500,000 dedicated to
the operating budget by FY18. The current policy allocates 20% to capital, 40% to the Stabilization Fund
and 40% to remain in undesignated fund balance. This forecast recommends we allocate the funds
toward the Capital Budget (20%), Stabilization Fund (25%) and OPEB Trust Fund (15%), with 40% 
remaining in undesignated fund balance. Total free cash is estimated at $2.6 million per year. This
change is highlighted in the Revenue Detail chart, listed as Chart 2 on page 16.

Other Revenue
Miscellaneous revenue includes parking meter revenue and funds allocated from the consumer
protection fund. These revenue sources total less than $100,000 per year and are estimated to be level
for the term of the forecast. 
Future Spending: 2014 to 2018
Expenditure growth is based on projecting the cost of existing services. There are no added services or
positions; this is the estimated future cost of the Town-wide services and operations we currently
provide.  Basic assumptions for growth in spending are different depending upon the cost category and
the specific cost. Overall total spending is projected to increase: 4% in FY14, 4.8% in FY15, 4.3% in
FY16, 4.6% in FY17 and 4.4% in FY18. Since revenues are increasing in the low to mid 3% it is clear
spending is outpacing revenue. In FY16 operating costs overtake salary costs as the biggest part of the
expenditure budget. This is primarily due to fixed cost increases such as liability insurance, debt service, 
health insurance and special education tuition. The line graph on page 8 illustrates this point. The cost
component with the greatest individual rate of growth is still health insurance. Health insurance is
anticipated to increase a small percentage for FY13, carrying over savings from the last health insurance
contract. Future growth in health insurance ranges from 7% to 8% per year. This assumes high claims
experience for FY14 and reasonable claims experience in the out years. If claims increase dramatically, 
rates will have to be increased more than anticipated here. The health insurance spending assumes
savings of $739,000 in FY14 but no other changes to future health insurance benefits at this time since
this need to be bargained, even with the passage of health insurance reform. If savings are achieved over
the next few months this will mitigate the deficit amounts for FY15 and the future. We continue to
need to reduce the cost of health insurance as the rate of growth of cost outpaces our ability to raise
revenue. As shown in the graph below, without further changes to reduce the cost of health insurance
it will grow to more than 18% of the budget by FY18. This is less than previously projected, but still too
high. Therefore until we find the right mix of plan coverage and employee/employer contribution that
won’t break the bank, we need to keep negotiating change.

Salary Expenditures
Spending on salaries is expected to be $115.99 million in FY14, increasing to $134.63 million by FY18. 
The projection rate for salaries is different depending upon the department but is either three percent
or four percent per year. This assumes no additional positions in future years; staffing is the same as
the FY13 base year. In general school salaries are increasing at a 4% rate and municipal departments
are increasing at a 3% rate. Again, there is no added staff or additional programming in this projection. 
In FY13 salaries are 49% of the budget. By FY17 salaries are expected to decrease as a percent of the
total budget to 48%. See the graph below. 
Operating Costs
Operating costs for FY14 total $113.6 million or 48% of the total budget. Based on the growth of health
insurance and special education out of district tuition, operating costs will overtake salary costs as a
percent of the budget in FY16. School operating costs have an estimated annual rate of growth of 7%,
matching the last two years of health insurance. Special education out of district tuition is a cost the
state has a responsibility to help fund; they set the reimbursement and tuition rates. However, the state
fails to keep pace; hence the rising Town cost. In the prior forecast operating costs would overtake
salaries in FY14. The reduction in health insurance in FY13 has reset the base for the growth trend
which delays when operating spending will outpace salaries to FY16. Operating spending will increase
to $139.9 million by FY18 and take up 49% of the budget. The graph below shows this trend. 
Energy spending
Town-wide energy costs for FY14 are expected to be $4.2 million or 1.8% of the total budget. The rate
of growth is about 4% depending upon the year and the length of the energy usage contracts. By FY18
energy spending is forecast to be $4.8 million, dropping to 1.7% of the total budget. The annual Capital
Budget has included a number of energy saving projects for almost all buildings, reducing our carbon 
7
Page 9
footprint. In addition, the Town contracts for electricity and gas on a town-wide basis and has had
favorable results in the recent bids. The town is entering into an energy audit to determine the next
steps for energy consumption. 
Small Capital projects and equipment
Repair and maintenance projects that do not rise to the definition of capital project are funded in the
operating budget in the category called small capital. Total spending for small capital in FY14 is forecast
at $1.48 million or less than 1% of the budget. Spending for this category is expected to be relatively
static since they are one-time items. FY18 spending is forecast at $1.8 million. This budget category
tends to be the area where budget cuts first hit. Unfortunately that means maintenance on physical
assets is delayed and damage results. 
Strategic Investments
The expenditure picture presented in this forecast does not include any additional staff. That does not
mean that additional resources are not needed. The School Department is looking to rebuild programs
that have been reduced in tight budgets. Staff turnover in the next couple of years in the public safety
departments presents us with a problem with both overtime and adequate staffing of shifts. In both
Police and Fire we could see 20 employees retire each year; it takes about a year to backfill and train
these civil service positions. Deferred maintenance on facilities, equipment and infrastructure will
require investment via the capital and operating budgets, incurring more debt service and small capital
spending. This will requires study of the different components of the budget, forecast here, to find ways
to economize existing services to invest in greater priorities.

Unfunded Liabilities
Pension Fund
The Town pension fund contribution is increasing 5% per year based on the recently funding schedule
(see pension fund schedule comparison, Chart 4, on page 19).  Investment return recovery has been
fairly aggressive allowing the Retirement Board to adopt a funding schedule that maintains the current
date for achieving full funding (2030).  The new funding schedule was recently adopted at the August
Retirement Board Meeting after a lengthy discussion and data provided by the PERAC Actuary team. An
actuarial valuation must be performed on the assets of the fund accounting for the demographics and
salary data of the members, every two years. The economic downturn of 2008/9 did have an effect on
the assets of the fund, reducing it value by 30% in 2008. However, prior to that the Board kept an
aggressive funding schedule that shortened the full funding date from 2028 to 2026. This gave the fund
some breathing room for the effects of investment loss. It was perfect timing. In 2010, the Retirement
Board adopted a schedule that combined additional funding and deferred timing (2030, extend 4 years) 
so as not to overwhelm the budget but not skirt the unfunded liability. The 2012 funding schedule does
not retreat from that 2010 goal; holding the line at a 2030 full funding timeline. This saves the Town
$4.6 million versus deferring full funding to 2031. The chart on page 19 provides the details of the two
options. Given the significance of this decision, the Town Manager, the Finance Committee and the
Ways and Means Committee were invited and encouraged to attend and participate in the discussion. 
The Framingham Retirement System invests its pension fund with the state PRIT (Public Retirement
Investment Trust) Fund. This fund covers pensions for all vested Framingham employees. The
Framingham Retirement System (FRS) does not include Framingham teachers who are members of the
Massachusetts Teachers Retirement System (MTRS).  The FRS also includes as members employees of
the Framingham Housing Authority and the MetroWest Regional Transit Authority. Both of those
entities are responsible for contributing their own money into the pension fund; the Town is not
responsible for any portion of their pension obligation. The average Framingham retiree pension is
approximately $20,600. Employees contribute a portion of their pay into the pension fund at varying
percentages. For those Group 1 (non-public safety) employees contributing 9% of their pay, they are
fully funding their own pension. They are not creating any unfunded liability. The unfunded liability is
due to the inadequate contribution by the employer for many years; and the inadequate percentage
contributed by employees hired prior to 1986 who contributed as little as 5% of their pay. The two
graphs on page 20 provide information on the average pensions of some comparable communities and
the adopted full funding dates of those same communities. This data tells us that Framingham has a
modest average pension and an aggressive full funding date. These are positive criteria for both the
status of the fund and for the creditworthiness of the Town. 
Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) 
OPEB is the future benefit cost of current and future retirees. OPEB is currently an unfunded liability, 
but it is not required by law to be funded. This liability must be recorded on the financial statements
of the Town, which it has since 2008. A substantial number of communities have begun funding this
cost, either in whole or in part. For FY13, Town Meeting voted to create an irrevocable trust fund to
invest OPEB contributions. The FY13 budget includes allocating $1.5 million to fund a portion of what
the annual required contribution. The full annual funding of this cost would be in the range of $14 to
$16 million. This amou nt will change based on the progress we have made in reducing the cost of 
9
Page 11
health insurance through negotiated plan design change, the allocation of eligible costs to Medicare, and
the reduction of non-vested staff. For FY14 the OPEB contribution is funded by a combination of free
cash and room and meals tax and totals $601,117. For future years a smaller contribution is
incorporated into this forecast allocating an increasing portion of free cash, ranging from $225,000 to
$315,000. As we identify additional savings or revenues, whether recurring or non-recurring (one-time) 
we should consider supplementing this funding schedule. Any dollars we contribute to the OPEB Trust
Fund now is counted as a plan asset and reduces the overall liability and the amount of the liability we
must record on the Town financial statements. There is no requirement to fully fund the required
contribution, even if we are partially funding it now. However, the comptroller of the Commonwealth
estimates we will be required to fund something in the next three to four years. 
The Town pays a portion of health insurance for all employees who retire from Framingham either via
the Framingham Retirement System, or in the Massachusetts Teachers Retirement System (MTRS).
Several years ago the Town adopted the provision that all Medicare eligible retirees must enroll in
Medicare Part B and then participate in a Medicare supplement plan. This saves the Town a significant
amount of money since hospitalization expenditures are covered without cost to the Town. Every
savings measure we take for health insurance also reduces this liability. Since the recording of this
liability, the Town has reduced the liability from the 2008 valuation of $216.9 million to $202 million
determined by the 2010 valuation. The annual difference is significant as depicted in the graph of the
two recommended funding schedules show below. The next valuation is underway; it will include the
significant savings achieved by the 2011 and 2012 changes in health insurance coverage and the reduction
of employees in School busing. While we do not have an estimate of what these savings will be, the
valuation will have an exact number. The study should be completed by the end of December and the
report will be circulated to all Town officials, boards and committees. An estimate of the reduction to
the OPEB liability and its corresponding funding schedule is included in the chart below. 
Note: there is an additional report on the rules of the irrevocable trust fund, funding status and liability
amounts created for Town Meeting under Article 1 item 2D. It is on the back table for the 2012 fall
Special Town Meeting.

Stabilization Fund
Town policy requires, and state and financial rating agencies recommend that municipalities have a
stabilization fund that is 5% of the total annual budget. Since FY2009, the plan has to allocate 40% of
net free cash and the entire revenue from local room and meals taxes to the fund until it reaches the
policy level. At the current rate that would be accomplished in FY14. This is a year earlier than
projected because the free cash allocation in FY13 is $725,373, double what had been allocated in FY12. 
Combined with the room and meals tax of $1.5 million the contribution to the fund for FY13 is
$2,236,727. This also means that the combination of free cash, room and meals tax for FY14 would
require only $750,000 to reach the 5% target. The fall Special Town Meeting this year will have the
option of adding additional revenue to the Stabilization Fund. This would bring the fund to its 5% goal
in FY13 and allow a smaller allocation of revenue (just free cash) through FY18 to maintain the 5% 
requirement. If a smaller portion of revenue is allocated then we will continue to need an allocation of
room and meals tax to maintain a 5% fund balance. The examples are listed in the tables below.

The achievement of the 5% policy goal would allow the reallocation of targeted room and meals tax
revenue away from the Stabilization Fund and have it replace free cash as a recurring revenue source. 
The amounts are the same: we use $1.5 million of free cash in the operating budget (refer to the Free
Cash section on page 6 of this document and the Revenue Detail Chart 2 on page 16).  The room and
meals taxes total approximately $1.5 million annually. This would assign recurring revenues (taxes) to
recurring expenditures and removed non-recurring revenue (free cash) from the recurring expenditures. 
As mentioned previously, the use of free cash as a recurring revenue source for the operating budget
was a financial weakness cited in the latest Moody’s credit rating review.
