Executive Summary
”The goal of forecasting is not to predict the future but to tell what you need to know
to take meaningful action in the present.”1
The purpose of a Long Range Forecast is to provide Administrators, Committees, Town Meeting, and
Taxpayers with important data regarding the finances of the Town. This particular document
concerns the General Fund only; there is an additional report that provides a five year forecast of the
two enterprise funds (Water and Sewer). This year the Long Range Forecast is significantly different
than the past reports. Prior reports included estimated future revenue and expenditures based on one
set of existing circumstances. This year several different scenarios are estimated and the overall effect
on the bottom line is presented in a summary form with details attached as exhibits at the end. 
Through out all scenarios presented in this report, the debt service on borrowing is kept within the 5% 
policy limit. This means that a significant amount of capital investment within the General Fund
would not be authorized. This is beyond the usual level of deferral that is recommended and Town
Meeting approves. The majority of road, storm water, technology and school repairs and equipment
would be deferred and the Town would fall further behind in the required upkeep of Town assets. 
This is because two major school projects are planned for FY16 ($48 million) and FY18 ($20 million).
Even with state funding for a portion of these projects, they are of such magnitude that they do not fit
within the debt limit. 
Revenue options are presented at varying tax levy limits for one year only (FY15): 2.5%, 2%, and
1.5%.  The impact of reducing the levy for the one year has a five year revenue reduction of $4.5
million (for a 2% levy) and $9 million (for a 1.5% levy).  All other revenue components are kept
constant. 
Expenditure options focus primarily on reducing health insurance costs and increasing funds for the
OPEB liability. Health insurance spending is benchmarked as a percent of total spending. In FY14
health insurance is 14.8% of the total budget; if we can reduce that to 13% of the total budget we can
save $25 million over five years (see detailed discussion on page 5).  One scenario displays increasing
OPEB funding to $2 million per year (Chart 5, page 15) and another is the combination of reducing
health insurance and increasing OPEB (Chart 6, page 16).
At a 2.5% levy, a significantly reduced capital investment plan, and no other extraordinary costs, 
deficits are forecast for the five year term (Chart 1, page 11).  It is clear that expenditures still need to
be reduced and revenue sources need to be expanded and development and redevelopment
encouraged. The data in this report is intended to provide some insight into the options available.

Revenue
The revenue estimates included in this report reflect decreasing levy limits. This is the only revenue
factor that is changing in the multiple scenarios provided in this report. Other revenue components
such as new growth, state aid, local receipts, enterprise fund indirect revenue and free cash do not
change from scenario to scenario. The details for each revenue component are described below. 
In the exhibit section at the back of this report is a revenue detail sheet for all three levy scenarios. 
Table 1 is the full 2.5% levy; Table 2 is the 2% levy and Table 3 is the 1.5% levy. 
The trend in revenue anticipates that state aid will pick up another percentage point of the total
revenue by FY19 as depicted by these two pie charts:

The decrease in the average single family tax bill for a 2% levy would be approximately $26. The
decrease in the average single tax bill for a 1.5% levy would be approximately $56. 
New Growth in Property Taxes
“New Growth” is the term for increased tax revenue from new development. There are a number of
development and redevelopment projects underway, including large ones at TJX, Genzyme, 
Pennsylvania Ave, Danforth Green and most recently the old Breyers property. The new growth
projections anticipate some of that productivity as new tax revenue. Until the finalized projects are
valued, however, these are just rough estimates. The range in revenue is $919,360 in FY15 to
$1,193,414 in FY19. To generate this amount of revenue the increase in property value would range
from $23 to $30 million. 
State Aid
Total state aid is estimated to grow by 4.6% to 6.1% from FY15 to FY19. Growth rates of the
individual state aid components are listed in the revenue detail sheet, Table 1, in the exhibits section of
this report. Note that the state reimbursement for school debt service decreases by 15% in FY16. 
Chapter 70 aid has been increasing by large amounts due to a phased in formula adjustment. This
adjustment is expected to end for FY15 when growth rates drop to 7% per year. Unrestricted General
Government Aid, growth of which has been paltry to non-existent until FY14, is expected to continue
to grow slowly for FY15 and FY16 and then at 4% thereafter. 
Local Receipts
Local receipts are fees, user charges, local taxes, rent, investment income and fines created and/or
controlled by the municipality. The Town collects three taxes: motor vehicle excise, 6% room tax and
.75% meals tax. Excise tax has rebounded due to the recovery automobile market. Room and meals
taxes are expected to grow slightly as well. Overall local receipts are projected to increase by a little
over 2% in FY15 and FY16. The elimination of rental income from the Farley School will cause local
receipts to decrease by 3% in FY18. The detail growth rates are included on Table 1 in the exhibits
section of this report.

Free Cash
Free cash is the amount of money left over and unrestricted in the General Fund at the end of the fiscal
year. The long term plan for free cash is to eliminate its use in the operating budget and to designate
60% of it for the Stabilization Fund, Capital, and OPEB Liability; as described in the table below:

Enterprise Indirect Charges
State regulation allows a municipality to charge other funds for the overhead costs to manage the
programs and the finances of the specific fund. The charges must be proportional to the level of effort
spent by staff and managers and the direct costs of overhead expenses. This revenue source ranges
from $2.8 million to $3.3 million with a growth rate of 3-4%.
Estimated Expenditures
Generally expenditures are forecast based on existing services and programs. No new programs or
additional staff is added. Personnel costs for increased by 3-4% per year depending upon the salary
schedules and collective bargaining increases. This assumes only a 1% COLA in future years. 
Operating costs are projected at 2-6% growth depending upon the cost type. Special Education costs, 
roadway supplies and roadway salt, for example, increase at higher percentages (4-6%).  Energy costs
are still forecast at 3% growth; the potential for savings from any energy services contracts are not
included. 
This forecast focuses on three cost components and forecasts several options for attention: the limits of
debt service in relation to several large capital projects; reducing the cost of health insurance; and
increasing investment in the OPEB Trust to reduce our unfunded liability. These ideas are described
below. 
Debt Service is restricted to 5% of the Operating Budget
Debt service is the annual cost of paying for borrowing for capital projects. Capital project capacity is
limited to incurring debt service at or below the 5% policy limit that was created in FY02. In two
fiscal years, FY16 and FY19, there are two extraordinary projects that take up almost the entire capital
project budget. The Fuller/Farley School replacement project is $48 million in FY16 while a $20
million unspecified project is scheduled for FY19. Both of these projects assume 40% MSBA funding, 
reducing the amounts to borrow by $20 million and $8 million respectively. The significant
restriction on the ability to keep up with capital maintenance and replacement on every other capital
project, including the roadway management plan, maintenance and repair of other school buildings, 
storm water repairs and improvements, municipal equipment, park maintenance and recreation
facility upkeep, is reflected in the following chart.

It is clear that, like the High School project, these major School building contraction projects should be
considered for financing outside the debt limit via debt exclusion. A debt exclusion authorization
requires both the vote of Town Meeting and a Town-wide ballot vote. 
Health Insurance
The Town’s cost of health insurance has long been an area of concern. One metric for benchmarking
health insurance costs is its percent of the total operating budget. The FY14 ratio is 14.8%.  If we do
nothing to curb the cost of health insurance, the cost will increase to over 15% of the budget in five
years.

Cost reduction comes not just from changes in employee/employer contributions. In fact overall
savings can be greater from changes in health plans (“plan design”) that encourage more cost

Page 7
effective choices and from maximizing health cost subsidies. If the costs of health insurance were to
be reduced to 13% of the total budget it could save more than $25 million over 5 years. In order to
save that kind of money we need to take advantage of ALL the cost reduction resources we have
available.

Retirement Costs
Pensions
The Town pension fund contribution is increasing 5% per year based on the recently funding
schedule. Investment return recovery has been fairly aggressive allowing the Retirement Board to
adopt a funding schedule that maintains the current date for achieving full funding (2030).  By
keeping the funding schedule at the 2030 full funding timeline the Framingham Retirement System
saves $4.6 million in interest costs. Accordingly the Town of Framingham saves 96.13% of that. This
forecast simply holds to that schedule. The next valuation is scheduled for January of 2014. At that
point we expect to see the results of the fund recovery from the loss of 2008. In the 28 year history of
the Framingham Pension fund (through 2012) the actual rate of return is 9.35%. The graphs below
highlight some interesting facts related to Framingham’s Retirement System.

Other Post Employment Benefits (OPEB) 
OPEB is the future benefit cost of current and future retirees. OPEB is currently an unfunded liability, 
but it is not required by law to be funded. This liability must be recorded on the financial statements
of the Town, which it has since 2008. A substantial number of communities have begun funding this
cost, either in whole or in part. For FY13, Town Meeting voted to create an irrevocable trust fund to
invest OPEB contributions. Contributions to the trust were $1.5 million in FY13 and $700,565 in
FY14. During the term of this forecast the total annual contribution would be $15 to $18.6 million. 
However, any amount we contribute now before we are mandated reduces the overall liability for this
future cost. In addition to making contributions to the trust, another way to reduce the liability is to
reduce the cost of and Town obligation for health insurance now. Refer back to the section on health
insurance and carry that idea to the OPEB liability; you can see how important and effective a
reduction in health insurance cost is. The latest OPEB liability valuation was issued as of July 1, 2012. 
A significant reduction in the liability was achieved due to the recent efforts to reduce health
insurance costs. The graphs below illustrate:

This forecast includes a scenario that increases the contribution to the OPEB trust to $2,000,000
annually; a combination of free cash and General Fund revenues (exhibits Chart 5 on page 15).  It also
includes a scenario that reduces health insurance to 13% of the total budget AND the increase in OPEB
(exhibits Chart 6 on page 16).
