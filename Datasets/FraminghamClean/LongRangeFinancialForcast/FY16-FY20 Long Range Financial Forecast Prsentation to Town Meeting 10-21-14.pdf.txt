Near Term Tax Estimate
• The 3 Year Budget Plan for FY15-17 includes a
goal to increase the average single family tax
bill by less than $100 per year
– FY16 projections indicate this can be done
– FY17 would have to resolve estimated deficit of
$3.8 million-not impossible
– Assumes moderate change in values and no large
swing in value toward residential or commercial
– Smaller tax burden reserves built into FY16 & 17
Page 15
Summary Outlook
• FY16 Goal of 1.25% Levy and avg SF tax bill
increase of less than $100 can be done
• FY17 Goal of the same will be more
challenging
• FY18-20 shows significant deficits which means
more cost control and revenue alternatives
– Debt service from Fuller/Farley project in FY19-20 is
included within the levy for this estimate, if debt
excluded it would be removed
– Timing of debt service can be managed aggressively
to help reduce the deficit amounts, but will not
resolve deficits
– Will be ending first term of GIC, health insurance
decision-making will be critical
Page 16
Summary Outlook
• State aid continues to underfund mandates-
need to keep pressure on
– Fix Ch 70 formula
– Fund Special Ed circuit breaker
– Fix homeless transportation both
reimbursement and service delivery state wide
– Limit increases on state charges
• Stay within pattern of wage settlements
