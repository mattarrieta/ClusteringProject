Long Range Financial Forecasting
• Definition
– To project revenues and expenditures, using

municipal and strategic planning

accomplish certain long term goals
Page 3
This Long Range Financial Forecast
• Two prong approach
– Standard forecast w/growth of base expenditure
budgets, moderate capital plan and revenues
based on the third year planned reduced levy
• Identifies a substantial budget deficit that needs to be
addressed
– Alternative forecast with some different short
term and near term assumptions
• Transition plan from FY17 partial to FY18 full levy
growth
• Serious review of existing capital project progress, 
project backlog and capacity to complete new projects
Page 4
This Long Range Financial Forecast
• Take into consideration the success of the
average residential tax bill goal: keep annual
increase under $100
– FY15 average increase was $30
– FY16 anticipate average increase of $81.35
– Over 2 FYs increase of $111 versus $200
• Scale back capital budget estimates; Debt
Service reduction
– We have a backlog of projects in the queue; limit
new authorizations and manage backlog for a
couple of years
– The adjusted forecast limits capital budgets to
the debt service limit

Additional Revenue Assumptions
• Property Tax Levy
– FY18, FY19, FY20 and FY21 assume annual
base levy growth of 2.5%
– New tax growth from development ranges
from $1.1M to $1.4M per year
• State Aid
– 5-7% growth in Chapter 70 Aid
– 3% growth in Unrestricted Gen’l Gov’t Aid
• Local Receipts
– Overall 1.2 – 3.2% growth; subcategories
range from 0-8%
Page 10
Revenue Assumptions (cont.)
• Free Cash
– Use significant amounts as part of two year
levy offset (FY16 and FY17)
– Allocate enough to Stabilization Fund to
maintain 5% policy goal
– Allocate almost $1M to Capital Stabilization
Fund annually
– Allocate a fixed portion of net free cash to
OPEB Trust
Page 11
Spending Assumptions
• No new programs or additional staff for
municipal departments
– Salary growth of 2-4% per year
– Operating cost growth of 0-5% per year
– Energy cost growth of 3% per year
• School Department Level Service
– Base budget growth of 4% per year
Page 12
Near Term Tax Estimate
• 3 Year Budget Plan goal for FY15-17 to
increase the average single family tax bill
by less than $100 per year
– FY15 was $30
– FY16 estimate is $81.35
– FY17 at a 1.75% levy would be $118.73
– Total 3 yr average SF home increase of $230; 
well under the $300 cap
Page 13
Summary Outlook
• FY18-20 shows deficits which means more
cost control and revenue alternatives
– By making a .5% change in the levy in FY17 we
add $4.6 million to the stream of revenue
through FY21
– Limit the authorization of capital projects to the
debt service limit
– Will be ending first term of GIC, health insurance
decision-making will be critical
– Stay with in established pattern of wage
settlements
Page 14
But…What’s Missing? 
• There is an enormous need to invest in
Town-owned buildings (Schools and
Community buildings)
– Over the next 5 years
• There is substantial roadway, bridge and
stormwater work that is not included in
the financials of these forecast scenarios
– Over the next 5 years
Page 15
Water Enterprise Fund Forecast
• Very moderate growth in personnel and
operating expenses
• Budget drivers are MWRA assessment and
debt service
– MWRA is 37% of FY17 budget forecast
– Debt Service is 37% to FY17 budget forecast
• Managing capital budget and issuance of
existing debt will make the largest impact
on rate growth
• Judicious use of retained earnings will help
smooth rate spikes
