Meeting Minutes  Board of License Commissioners  June 7, 2021 
The Board reviewed the following information: (1) Final Drafts. 
The Board reviewed the final drafts of the Regulations, including minor changes to the language
regarding the application process. 
Ms. Willoughby suggested edits to the section regarding one-day licenses to ensure necessary meeting
materials are received in time. She also recommended changing the language regarding endorsements
from various City departments since endorsements are provided after the applications are received. Mr. 
Barnosky noted that the language surrounding endorsements should not indicate that the Board’s
decisions must reflect the recommendations of the City departments, but that those recommendations
will be considered. 
Another suggested change included removing language about the ABCC’s happy hour restrictions from
the Framingham Regulations to avoid confusion or discrepancies. 
Ms. Wadland discussed possible future updates to the Regulations to allow BYOB. 
Board members agreed that the updated Regulations could be voted upon tonight pending the final
updates discussed at this meeting. Members agreed the new Regulations would go into effect
September 1, 2021.

August 19, July 22, 2019; June 18, May 21, and April 30, 2018, with amendments as discussed tonight. 
This will be effective as of September 1, 2021.

Commissioners thanked Chair Barnosky for his work on the Board.
