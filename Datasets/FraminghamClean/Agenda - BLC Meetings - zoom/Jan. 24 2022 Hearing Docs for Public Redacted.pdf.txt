SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY
INCIDENT 2105587
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY
On Saturday 9/11/2021 I, Officer Brendan MacKeil, was working the midnight shift assigned to area B
in cruiser 952. At approximately 0150hrs I was dispatched to 85 Hollis Street, Tropical Cafe for the
report of a possible fight in progress. Myself and several other officers responded to the scene and
on arrival there was a large group of people in the street in front of the bar. 
I spoke to Andre Silva  who works security who stated that prior to our arrival a Hispanic
male wearing a blue shirt caused a disturbance inside of the bar. Mr. Silva stated he did not know
who the individual was who caused the disturbance. I spoke to the bar manager, Ramon Gallo (7/30/69) 
who stated that the male was asked to leave the bar at which point the male left the area and
returned moments later and was carrying a metal landscaping rake. 
Mr. Gallo stated that the unknown male started swinging the rake around and tried to get back into
the bar but was unsuccessful, no one was struck by the rake and no damage was done to the property. 
The male then left the scene and the other officers on scene searched the area in an attempt to
locate him. Nothing else to report at this time.

Authority, City of Framingham. 
On Saturday, September 11, 2021, I was made aware of an-that had occurred during the early
morning hours at 85 Hollis Street, Tropical Cafe. Refer to FPD incident 2105587 for further
details. On Monday, September 13, I began to investigate this incident by reviewing reports and
speaking to officers who had responded. According to police records, this service call occurred at
approximately 0151 hours. Five 911 calls had been placed and seven officers were involved in the
response. I spoke to Officers Franco and MacKeil who indicated that when they arrived, the subject
who had been involved in the altercation involving a landscaping rake, had fled the area, east on
Gordon Street. Officers searched the area but could not locate the party. 
On Monday, September 13, I learned of a video that had been posted on Instagram and later on
Framingham media sites which captured some of the events. I viewed the video and observed a male, 
later identified as  , deliver a closed fist punch at an individual later identified as
. This activity occurred on the sidewalk and public way (Hollis Street) 
in front of the Tropical Cafe. Following this assault, ran across the street and obtained a
steel street sign and sprinted across the street and attempted to strike staff members. and
security guards were able to avoid being struck by the weapon and were able to subdue and hold
him on the ground. When he had calmed down, and his friend were escorted across the street. 
They subsequently fled upon police response. The video depicts the disruption of traffic on the
public way as security and Ramon attempted to diffuse the assault. 
On Tuesday, September 14, I called Manager of Record, Solange Moura, to schedule a meeting to
discuss the events. The meeting was scheduled for the following day, September 15, 2021 at 1130
hours. Solange offered to travel to the station and arrived on time. We spoke in the first-floor
training room of the police department; Lt. Ruiz was also present. Solange explained that she had

been working on Friday night into Saturday morning and had been present during the altercation. She
noted that she did have security video recordings which she would provide to me. Solange had
reviewed the video prior to our meeting. She indicated that-was not recognized as being a
regular customer of the establishment. She had not personally observed any disturbance inside until
security agent Miguel Desouza-Filho escorted outside the establishment. Miguel was observed
in the Instagram video conducting a phone call to police as  was being held on the ground. 
Solange indicated that on the day following the disturbance, travelled to the restaurant to
apologize. was told that he was no longer welcome at the business and ordered not to return. 
Solange told me the full name and phone number that-had provided. Solange noted that Miguel
was temporarily suspended from the location to prevent retaliation if _ did return. Solange
estimated that there were approximately two hundred patrons inside the building on that evening. 
The capacity of the business was one hundred forty-six people. Solange stated that she removed the
tables to provide more space and accessibility. I strongly advised her that this practice would
cease immediately as this would present a safety concern in the event of afire or other emergency. 
Solange was very cooperative and honest throughout our conversation and indicated that she would
like to work to resolve any licensing issues appropriately. 
On Thursday, September 16, Assistant Manager Ramon Gallo provided copies of the following Alcohol
Server IDs: Francis Moura (security), Solange Moura (manager of record), Ramon Gallo (assistant
manager), Davidson Rosario (security), Kamila Souza (server), Miguel Desouza-Filho (security),
Vanessa Falcao (server), Paulo De0liveira (bartender), Paula Carvalho (bartender), Inae Antunes
(server), Angela Rosa (server), Reis Da Silbeira (server), Ingryd Silva (server), Ana Paula Silva
(server), Arielle Moreira (security). All of these employees were working that evening except for
Ingryd Silva. The Licensed Assistant Manager Luciano Lima's identification card was not present. 
On Friday, September 17, 2021, Ramon Gallo met me at the station and provided the security camera
recording on a thumb drive. The video included the outside recordings and we watched portions of
the recordings together in the second-floor commanding officer's room. The front entrance camera
showed at approximately 0144 hours, Miguel escorted out of the establishment. At 0145 _
returned and punched promoter staff member,  in the face twice. ran off
and at 0152 hours, he returned with a steel landscape rake and attempted to smash the front glass
door. He was unsuccessful and Ramon was observed exifiing the restaurant to calm him down. _
then punched _ once and ran across the street. At that point, he obtained a parking sign and
charged across the street swinging it wildly at employees. He struck security agent _
with the sign and was subdued by several staff members. Ramon was observed on top of
attempting to hold him on the ground. An unknown female picked up the sign and struck
's back with it. At approximately 0154 hours-was released from the ground and again
become violent. Security then let  friends escort him across the street and police arrived
at approximately 0156 hours. 
At approximately 1500 hours on Friday, September 17, I traveled to Tropical Cafe with Officer Franco
for a site visit. I mefi with Ramon Gallo and Assistant Manager Luciano Lima. Photographs were
conducted of the parking sign and the landscape rake which had been retained at the business. Due
to the size of the items, they were secured at the establishment and not transported to the station. 
Photographs were conducted of the damaged front door with a patrol camera. While on site, I viewed

the security video from the events that transpired inside the establishment. The video showed
Miguel moving patrons towards the exit. At one point, appeared to be arguing with Miguel
about leaving. pushed Miguel and Miguel proceeded to hook his arm around _s neck and
escorted him outside. Ramon advised me that he would provide me with a copy of the security
footage. Ramon stated that David had only been at the establishment an estimated one or two hours
as he recalled initially not letting him in due to-wearing sandals. David later returned with
sneakers and was permitted entry. Ramon indicated that he was unsure of the amount of drinks that
-purchased as the receipts for credit cards only display the account number. did not
appear to have any issues with mobility or his general demeanor prior to being asked to leave. 
While on site at Tropical Cafe, I inspected the alcohol license which was conspicuously posted
behind the bar. The license displayed the Manager as Solange Moura and the Assistant Manager as
Luciano Lima. The capacity of the establishment was shown as one hundred forty-six people. Luciano
indicated that he was acting less as an assistant manager capacity and that he was taking on the
roles related to audio visual responsibilities. This license information at the bar was confirmed
as matching the city records. Luciano stated that he did not have any current alcohol server
training or a management identification card. 
Officer Franco spoke with Security Agent Miguel later on September 17 and Officer Franco reported
the following: 
"I, officer Franco spoke with Miguel Desouza-Filho 08/29/85, regarding the above incident and he
made the following statements: While working as a security at Tropical cafe on Friday night he had
to remove a patron from the establishment due to his aggressive behavior. Miguel stated that as the
restaurant was closing he started advising everyone that they needed to leave. During that time he
approached and told he needed to leave because it was closing time. Miguel stated that
-started calling him an "Asshole" and that he was a "Piece of Shit" in Portuguese. Miguel
stated he turned around and continued asking other people to leave. Miguel stated that when he
looked back _ still wasn't moving and seemed like he was refusing to leave the restaurant. 
Miguel stated he advised-that he had to leave because everyone had to be outside by tam. 
Miguel stated that started to call him an "asshole" again in Portuguese. Miguel stated when he
placed his hand behind s back and told him he needed to leave because they were closing, _
turned back towards him, raised his arm and pushed on the arm and stated "nobody is going to
take me out" in Portuguese. Miguel stated that's when he grabbed from behind and escorted him
outside. Miguel stated that's when the incident outside happened. Miguel stated he didn't know _
and don't remember seeing him at Tropical before."
On September 23, 2021, Ramon met with me at the station. He provided further copies of alcohol
server training. All employees required to have training were current, with the exception of
Assistant Manager Luciano Lima. I spoke to Manager Solange Moura by phone on September 23 and
advised her of the progress of the investigation. She could not provide any further information on
the true identity o  Further attempts will be made to confirm the identity of _
and if accomplished charges will be filed. Solange indicated that Luciano was still the current
manager and that he had not renewed his alcohol training due to the pandemic but was in the process
of rectifying it immediately and obtaining his Management Identification
Card. On September 29, 2001, Luciano completed his alcohol training and later obtained his

You'll notice that the description of entertainment did not print on the Thursday-Saturday License. I believe this is due
to the new licensing system we transferred to last year. The description that printed on these licenses for previous
years' was Bands (up to 7 members), DJ, Karaoke, Dancing. It appears the problem has been corrected. Description
should print on 2022 Entertainment Licenses.

By virtue of the authority contained in Chapter 138 of the Massachusetts General Laws
(“Chapter 138”), and Article V, Section 1 of the City of Framingham General Ordinances (the
“Ordinances”), the Board of License Commissioners of the City of Framingham, serving as the City’s

Alcoholic Beverages (“Regulations”). The Regulations shall supersede all previous regulations or
policies issued by the City of Framingham (the “City”), or, collectively as the preceding licensing
authority, the Town of Framingham and/or Board of Selectmen. The Board has the power under the
Ordinances and the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to amend these Regulations
periodically from time to time as it sees fit. For the purposes hereof, the Regulations, Ordinances, and
Chapter 138 shall be collectively referred to as the “Laws”.
Any license issued for the sale in any manner of any alcoholic beverages (a “License”) shall be
issued on the condition of full compliance with these Regulations. The failure to comply with the Laws
and other Ordinances or rules issued by the City and/or the Board shall constitute sufficient cause or
grounds for refusing to grant the license, or for suspending, canceling, modifying, or revoking such
license or permit already granted, in accordance with Article XV herein. Any individual, organization, 
or company licensed by the Board pursuant to the Laws shall be referred to herein as a “Licensee”.
Any premises licensed by the Board pursuant to the Laws shall be referred to as the “Licensed
Premises”.
I.  Consumption of Alcoholic Beverages
Public consumption of alcoholic beverages as defined in Chapter 138, Section 1 is permitted
only in accordance with an appropriate License issued by the Board. Absent an appropriate License
issued by the Board, it is prohibited to drink any alcoholic beverage while on, in or upon any public
way or upon any way to which the public has a right of access; any place to which members of the
public have access as invitees or licensees; a park or playground. It is prohibited to drink any alcoholic
beverage while on, in or upon or private land or place without consent of the owner or person in control

application for Change of Manager of Record or Assistant Manager must be filed with the Board at
least two (2) weeks before the proposed effective date of the change (“Change of Management Notice
Deadline”), unless the Manager of Record has terminated his or her employment without prior notice to
the Licensee or is terminated by Licensee under circumstances which do not reasonably allow for
advance Change of Management Deadline Notice (“Early Management Termination”). In the event
of Early Management Termination, the Licensee must, within thirty (30) days of such termination, 
notify the Board of: (a) the basic facts surrounding such termination; (ii) the name of the person who

Page 5 of 21
Page 54
(iii) shall file the application for a Change of Manager no more than thirty (30) days after the departure
of the approved Manager of Record. If the Board finds that the circumstances justify the noncompliance
with the Change of Manager Notice Timeline, no penalty will be imposed so long as the Licensee
complies with subsections (i) through (iii) above. If the circumstances for the delay are not found to be
sufficient, or if the application for a Change of Manager is filed more than thirty (30) days after the
departure of the Manager of Record, the Board may impose a penalty or suspension of up to one (1) day
of suspension for each day of unjustified non-compliance or for each day that passes beyond the
passage of thirty (30) days after departure of the Manager of Record before the application for a new
manager is filed, or such other penalty permitted by Article XV herein. In addition to the foregoing, the
Board shall also have the right to impose penalties for the failure to provide timely notification of the
departure of an Assistant Manager. When submitting an application for change of Manager or Assistant
Manager, the Manager or Assistant Manager shall be certified as an alcohol server and registered with
the Police Department prior to submitting the application. Further, approval of a change in Manager
may be conditioned upon proof of payment of all outstanding local, state, and federal taxes and fees.

or, in the case of a new Manager of Record or Assistant Manager, upon being advised of the new
Manager of Record or Assistant Manager’s identity, the Framingham Police Department will conduct a
background check of any proposed Licensee, Manager of Record or Assistant Manager, and such check
will include a review of any existing criminal record. The Board may reject any application where the
Licensee’s, Manager of Record’s or Assistant Manager’s criminal record indicates, theft, unlawful drug
offense(s) (with the exception of any criminal arrest or conviction relating to possession of marijuana
which predate the enactment of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 94G), alcohol-related offenses, a
propensity for violence, or other behavior, that, in the opinion of the Board, might disqualify the
individual from responsibly carrying out their duties as Manager of Record or would otherwise put the
public at risk.
3.  Violations. A violation of any of subsection 1 regarding change of Manager shall
constitute a violation of these Regulations and shall subject the Licensee to possible discipline and/or
penalties in accordance with this section or with Article XV herein.
V.  Responsibilities of Manager of Record:
1.  Authority & Control of Licensed Premises.  The Board regards the Manager of
Record of Licensed Premises as the principal representative of the Licensee and as having full authority
and control of the Licensed Premises and of the conduct of all business therein relative to alcoholic
beverages, all as provided in the Laws. An Assistant Manager or other suitable managerial employee
capable of fulfilling the duties of Manager of Record must be listed on the License by the Licensee. 
This will allow for continuity of the Manager position should either the Manager of Record or Assistant
Manager positions become vacant during the course of the year.
2.  Responsibilities. Without limiting the scope of the previous subsection, the Board will
hold the Manager of Record responsible for the following:
a. Careful selection of qualified employees of the licensed business, including servers,

Page 6 of 21
Page 55
b. Training of employees in all matters relating to the sale and service of alcoholic
beverages;
c. Assuring that employees serving alcohol to the public have successfully completed
an alcoholic beverage training program for serving alcohol responsibly and strongly
encourage continual training of employees engaged in serving and selling alcoholic
beverages;
d. Ensuring that no criminal activity, including the sale and distribution of narcotic
drugs, takes place on the Licensed Premises, including within any parking area
ancillary to or serving the Licensed Premises;
e. Promptly reporting to the Police Department all instances of attempted purchases
or procurement of service of alcoholic beverages by minors, including attempts to
gain access to premises upon which alcoholic beverages are served and from which
minors are excluded, and appropriate action taken by the Licensee in response
thereto. Such appropriate action shall include (1) Reporting to the Registry of
Motor Vehicles instances involving possession or use of a false, forged, or
counterfeit license to operate motor vehicles or identification card issued by the
Registry of Motor Vehicles; (2) confiscation of liquor identification cards or motor
vehicle operator’s license presented by the minor; and (3) if a purchase was made
or service was procured, the name of the Licensee’s employee participating
therein;
f. Enforcement of the Laws with respect to the operation of the licensed business;
g. Ensuring that the Licensed Premises, including the exterior, are kept clean, neat, 
and sanitary at all times; and
h. The Board strongly encourages the Manager of Record and/or Assistant Manager
to attend the recommended Annual Alcohol Education Seminar. Failure to attend
such seminar shall not constitute a defense to any violation of the Laws.
3.  Hours of Licensed Premises. Except as provided herein, the Manager of Record
must be a full-time employee or a corporate officer of the Licensee, must be engaged exclusively in
the management of the licensed business, and must be a qualified seller or server of alcoholic
beverages registered with the Framingham Police Department. The Manager of Record shall not
undertake any non-managerial position(s) (i.e., bartender, server, cook) or any other role which
interferes with the Manager of Record’s oversight of the Licensed Premises. The Manager of Record
must be on the Licensed Premises at least forty (40) hours per week in the course of business,
consistent with the permitted hours of operation. When the Manager of Record is not upon the
Licensed Premises, the person in charge of the business must be an Assistant Manager or a qualified
seller or server of alcoholic beverages registered with the Framingham Police Department and
designated by the approved Manager of Record to have charge of the business in the Manager’s
absence. The Manager of Record shall be responsible for the operation of the business whether or not
on the Licensed Premises. When the Manager of Record is not upon the Licensed Premises, a method
Page 7 of 21
Page 56
of contacting the Manager of Record promptly must be arranged so that the Manager of Record can
be reached at all times by the person designated to be in charge of the Licensed Premises. The
provisions of the first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to any Licensee holding a license
issued under Chapter 138, Section 12 to a veterans’ organization or to a Licensee holding a license
issued to a club under Chapter 138, Section 17.
4.  Failure of the Manager of Record to comply with this policy or to properly discharge
the duties of manager may result in removal as Manager or suspension or revocation of the License as
may be appropriate to the circumstances.
VI. Procedure for Obtaining Liquor Licenses
The applicant for a License of any type should submit a letter to the Board outlining the
proposal with a completed application and include a request for a hearing with the Board. The applicant
should request to be placed on the agenda and publish a public notice of the date selected for the
hearing in accordance with Chapter 138. At a duly noticed public hearing, the Board will consider the
application for a License and the input of any interested members of the public. The Board will then
consider the application and respond in a timely manner to the applicant. The Board shall provide a
copy of these Regulations to each Licensee at the time when they pick up their annual license. The
Licensee shall sign a receipt to be maintained by the Board evidencing their receipt of a copy of these
Regulations.
Pursuant to Chapter 138, Section 15A, where there are no premises actually in existence at the
time the application for a License is made, the applicant shall file a plan showing the actual dimensions
of premises which are to be constructed on which the License is to be exercised. A License granted
under this provision shall be upon the condition that such License shall not be issued until completion
of the Licensed Premises in accordance with the plan, and the decision of the Board as to whether the
plan has been complied with shall be final. The Board may include as a condition of such License that
the Licensed Premises be completed in accordance with the plan by a date certain or the License shall
be deemed null and void. Said specified completion date may be extended by the Board in its sole
discretion upon written request by the applicant submitted to the Board at least 45 days prior to the
expiration of the initial anticipated completion date as stated in the License.
VII. Considerations for Approval of New License or Transfer:
The Board will consider any or all of the following that can be reasonably offered in support of a
particular License application:
1. The applicant is a qualified Veterans’ organization and seeks a club license.
2. Subject to applicable zoning requirements, the applicant proposes an establishment that
offers a regular forum for music and musicians to play and obtain exposure for their work.
3. The applicant offers variety, or uniqueness, in its proposed establishment or shop, in
contrast to what exists in the City of Framingham at the time of the application.
4. The applicant demonstrates the elements for public need for the License particular location.
5. The applicant proposes an establishment that offers a substantial economic benefit to the
City of Framingham. 
Page 8 of 21
Page 57
6. Where the application pertains to a License to be issued pursuant to Chapter 138, Section
12, the applicant offers, in addition to alcoholic beverages, a variety of non-alcoholic
beverages (or beverages containing only trace amounts of alcohol), such as mocktails, craft
sodas, teas, kombucha, and non-alcoholic beer and wine, which are distinct from traditional
non-alcoholic beverages (water, soda, juice, etc.).
7. Proposals for off-premises retail establishments to be located in shopping malls or
high-density retail areas, either as new Licenses or transfers, are discouraged if the
applicant’s proposed License application duplicates or is similar to Licensed Premises
presently located in the area.
VIII. Modifications to Licensed Premises
Once a License is issued, no material physical changes to the Licensed Premises shall be made without
the prior approval of the Board. For the purpose of these Regulations, a material physical change shall
be considered a change in location or number of seats, location of bar, addition or reduction in square
footage, or any other change sufficient to require a building permit from the City of Framingham.
IX. Transfers of License
Licensees may request that their License be transferred to a third party. A $500 fee shall accompany
each application for ownership or transfer of location. Applications for transfer of ownership or location
shall be processed similarly to an original License application and the Board is not required to grant
such transfer requests. Approval of a transfer of majority ownership further may be conditioned upon
the proof of payment of all outstanding local, state, and federal taxes including, without limiting, the
following: receipts showing remittance to the proper taxing authorities of sales taxes, excise taxes and
withheld federal and state income taxes. Transfers of ownership to trustees in Bankruptcy, court-
appointed receivers, or to assignees for the benefit of the creditors and those taking title or possession
of the Licensed Premises by, through or under them will not be deemed to transfer or convey any rights
to the license or the renewal or transfer of such license, unless provided by contrary superior law. Bona
fide mortgagees in possession who are listed in the application as holding such interest shall be treated
in the same manner as the original majority ownership license. A public hearing shall be required for
any transfers of ownership or location, including, but not limited to transfers to mortgagees.
X.  Distribution of Regulations
These Regulations, in their most updated form, shall be provided to all Licensees upon issuance
of their License and, further, shall be regularly available at the City of Framingham Licensing
Department and online at the City of Framingham Board of License Commissioner’s webpage. These
Regulations shall be appended to each annual license issued by the Board. The Licensee may not pick
up his/her annual license until the Licensee has signed a receipt acknowledging that a copy of these
Regulations has been received. A copy of the most updated Regulations shall be maintained on the
Licensed Premises at all times and shall be available for inspection upon request.

States or by a government of a foreign country recognized by the United States
government, or a valid U.S. issued Military ID card or a valid U.S. Passport Card.

risk that such licenses are real and valid.

Licensed Premises, and within areas under the Licensee’s control that abut the Licensed
Premises, is conducted in a responsible manner so that no activity shall detract from the

Premises is located. This shall include, but not be limited to, ensuring that there shall be
no disorder, unlawful use or sale of drugs, indecency, prostitution, assaults, lewdness, or
gambling on or about the Licensed Premises.
5.  Sale to Intoxicated Persons.  No alcoholic beverages shall be sold or delivered to an
intoxicated person.

individuals to whom alcoholic beverages may not be supplied are present, but the Board will
require that a sufficient number of trained servers be present to assure compliance with the laws
governing the sale of furnishing of alcoholic beverages to such persons.
2. FREQUENCY: One-day licenses are to be issued primarily to applicants sponsoring functions
that are not held more than once annually. Except for applicants that are in the business of
catering or accommodating individual functions, one-day licenses are not intended as an
alternative to an annual license.

with the Framingham Police Department.
2. Number of Service Providers:

the number of persons included in the invitations shall be used.
3. Hours of Service of Alcoholic Beverages:
The hours of sale and service for all one-day licenses shall be no later than 1:00 a.m. The “last
call” for all such licenses shall be no later than 12:30 a.m. The function shall conclude at 1:00
a.m., at the same hour as the license. Entertainment licenses shall state that the function shall
conclude at 1:00 a.m.
4. Number of Persons on Premises:
The number of persons may not exceed the occupancy limits allowed by law for the premises
on which the license will be exercised.
5. Police Detail:
The number of officers, if any, and the hours during which a police detail will be required
within the Licensed Premises and, if required, for orderly parking and traffic control will be
recommended by the Police Department. Generally, those hours will include the entire duration
of the function, including after service hours. The factors to be considered include the location
of the premises, availability of on-site parking, the number of persons estimated to be in
attendance and the time and duration of the function.
6. Insurance:

C.  Additional Provisions. The following additional provisions shall apply to one day
licenses.
1. Departmental Approvals:

Premises, including, where applicable, food service equipment. For any function to which the

the application will be responsible for the orderly conduct of the function for which the license
is issued. Consumption of alcoholic beverage outside of the structure within which the Licensed
Premises, i.e., where the function is held will not be permitted. Music, noise, or other function-

recommended of bar tenders and servers). The Board Chair, or delegate(s), is hereby authorized
to approve on behalf of the Board one-day licenses meeting the requirements of this policy. 
Applications that are not approved by the Board Chair may be brought to the Board for
approval and shall be accompanied by the Board Chair’s summary of reasons for declining
approval. The office of the Licensing Board must receive such requests for Board approval not
later than noon on the Tuesday of the calendar week before the day on which the licensed

conventions, trade association events, etc., will be charged a fee of
$50.00 for each license application.
XIV. Penalties, Procedure and Structure for Violations of the Ordinance and Regulations
A.  Purpose
The purpose of this penalty structure is to improve the ability of the Board to prevent alcohol
abuse and violation of the Laws. This Article XV will help to achieve reasonable uniformity in the
imposition of penalties and to avoid confusion in the minds of the public, patrons, and Licensees due to
a lack of understanding of the consequences of violating the Laws and License terms. This Article XV
is intended to empower the Board to consider the circumstances of each case and provide a mechanism
by which Licensees can improve their compliance with the Laws in the future.
B.  General Provisions
A.  No Illegality on Premises. No Licensee shall permit any illegality to occur on the
Licensed Premises, regardless of whether such illegality relates to the sale and service
of alcoholic beverages. The Manager of Record shall at all times maintain order and
decorum on the premises and in the immediately surrounding area of the premises and
shall cooperate with City officials in ensuring safe and orderly facilities.
B.  Reporting of Incidents. All violations of the Laws are to be reported to the Framingham
Page 14 of 21
Page 63
Police Department by the owner, Manager, Assistant Manager, or any employee of the
Licensee that becomes aware of an offense involving the Licensed Premises within
twenty-four hours of said violation unless the incident is serious enough to comprise
public safety and needs immediate attention at which time Framingham Police shall be
notified forthwith. Failure to report a violation involving the Licensed Premises
constitutes a violation of these Regulations and will subject the Licensee to appropriate
discipline in accordance with the procedure set forth herein.
C.  Penalties; Generally. Penalties for offenses shall be in line with the City’s general
goals of protecting public safety and the general welfare. Penalties will also be imposed
with the goal of preventing future offenses. A violation of these Regulations alone
(rather than state law or the Ordinances) may give rise to the issuance of penalties
pursuant to this Article to the extent permitted under law. The nature and severity of
the penalties imposed will be decided according to the nature of the offense and the
presence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances as further described herein. All
offenses by Licensees will result in the imposition of a penalty of some degree. This
will impress upon Licensees, managers, and servers their responsibility for ensuring
compliance with these Regulations, for prevention of offenses and for compliance with
the terms of licenses and the liquor laws of the Commonwealth.
a. Types/Categories of License Penalties. Penalties by the Board may consist of
any one or more of the following as appropriate: (a) Revocation of License; (b) 
Suspension of License; (c) Modification of License; (d) Imposition of New
Conditions on the License; (e) Imposition of Monetary Fines; (f) Mandatory
Participation in Alcohol Abuse and Offense Prevention Programs; and/or (g) 
any other reasonable penalty, in the Board’s reasonable discretion.
b. Penalty Guidelines. The penalty guidelines stated in these Regulations are
intended to provide indication of the range of penalties the Board will impose if
a hearing is held on any offense. The Board will refer to these guidelines by
deciding whether to approve a negotiated recommended resolution.
D. Police Department Recommendation; Negotiation Procedure; Record Keeping. The
Police Department is authorized to negotiate with any authorized representative of the
Licensee the terms upon which the Police Department will recommend to the Board that an
offense be resolved. 
a. Any such negotiated recommended resolution must be in writing, signed by the
Manager of Record or designated representative of the Licensee charged with
the offense and approved by the Police Chief. The recommendation must
include a statement detailing the facts determined in the Police Department
investigation. The recommended resolution is not binding upon the City unless
and until approved by the Board.
b. If the Police Department and the Manager of Record and/or an authorized
representative of the Licensee cannot agree on a recommended resolution, the
Page 15 of 21
Page 64
Police Department will make any additional investigation it deems necessary
for a complete presentation of the facts and will file a written report with the
Board.
c. The Board may consider, but is not required to accept, a negotiated resolution
recommended by the Police Department. The Board is empowered to consider
alternative penalties consistent with this Article XV and the Laws.
d. The Police Department and the Board will maintain a public record of offenses
and their disposition that will be indexed according to the Licensee, Manager
or Assistant Manager, server and purchaser involved.
E. Notice to Licensee. Written notice shall be provided to a Licensee of an alleged
violation of the Laws. The notice provided to Licensee may contain the Police
Department's recommendation to the Board concerning the punishment for the alleged
violation. The notice will include the date of the event giving rise to the possible
disciplinary action, a description of the event, and a clear identification of the Laws that
are alleged to have been violated as a result of the event. Said notice will also provide
Licensee with the date upon which the Board will hold a hearing concerning the
Licensee's alleged violation. A notice containing the above-mentioned information shall
be sent to Licensee via certified mail return receipt requested no less than ten (10) days
prior to the date of the hearing before the Board. Licensees are entitled to retain counsel
to represent them at the hearing if they so desire.
F. Written Statement of Disciplinary Action. If the Board decides to take disciplinary
action against the Licensee for a violation of the Laws, the Board will provide the
Licensee with a statement of reasons why disciplinary action was taken against
Licensee. The above-mentioned statement of reasons will be included with the notice of
the Board’s disciplinary action.
C.  Determination of Penalties
Penalties will be determined according to the following procedure.
1.  The base level offense(s) will be determined from those offenses described in Article
XV, Section D.
2.  Adjustments according to the presence of factors that warrant an increase in the penalty
described in Article XV, Section E ("aggravating factors") or decrease described in
Article XV, Section F (“mitigating factors") will be considered.
3.  Adjustments according to the number of violations involved in the particular offense will
be considered.

considered. The Board is entitled to consider fines or suspensions issued by the
Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission in evaluating said prior violations and
penalties.
6.  Increases based on any previous written warnings given by the City to the Licensee will
be considered. Such increases will consider the date(s) of the written warning(s), the

5. Email dated December 1 from Felix Torres, Fire Marshal, Framingham Fire
Gabriella Olivera and Reginaldo Grillo seeking a change in the entertainment hours. Chair opened the
floor for questions/comments from the members, Ms. Potter had a question regarding the entertainment
during Monday to Thursdays, Mr. Grillo stated that there is no entertainment during those days, 
sometimes just acoustic guitar. Ms. Potter asked them to address the noise complains in Lt. McCarthy
memo. Mr. Grillo stated that the Police Dept had stopped by a couple of times regarding these
complains, he (Mr. Grillo) has gone outside and he has not noticed a lot of noise coming out of the
building. Not aware of any complains about the parking lot. Lt. McCarthy stated that the complains
were about loud music coming from the building, few parking issues but more about the music during, 
Friday, Saturday and Sunday. 
Ms. Potter inquired about private security and crowd management at the establishment, Mr. Grillo
indicated that there is a big place with the capacity of 160, Friday, Saturday and Sunday they have at
Page 157
least 8 security guards and keep everything in control especially at the doors, to make sure they are
closed but sometimes they have been left open that is why the complains about the noise. 
Mr. Pologe asked Lt. McCarthy on the handling of the noise complaints, he stated that sometimes there
is a delay in getting there, but they have addressed with the management and they are trying to deal with
it but it is a dense populated area. Mr. Pologe asked if there was any alcohol violation on record. Lt. 
McCarthy stated that is none that has been brought before the commission. 
Ms. Medrano indicated that there is a list of violations submitted by Inspectional Services and that is the
status of resolving those. Mr. Grillo stated that the establishment passed inspection last week and all the
required paperwork was sent, as well and he called to schedule a second inspection. He stated that he
personally dropped all the required paperwork at City Hall. 
Mr. Lipton asked how many establishments have comparable hours in the City? 
Lt. McCarthy stated that just a handful of establishments have hours until 2:00 am and the Police Dept. 
discourage approving hours this late. They are willing to go with 12:00 am Mon-Thu and Friday until
1:00 am, Lt. McCarthy pointed out that is it a Restaurant with entertainment or is it entertainment with a
Common Vic license? Combination of factors but he doesn’t feel that a restaurant should have
entertainment until 2:00 am. Mr. Lipton stated that there were noise complains on November 19th and
he wonders if there were previous noise complains or something changed to precipitate the complains. 
Lt. McCarthy responded that he compiles the data from the police log, although not always is very
detailed so he can’t tell if they were noise related. Mr. Lipton asked the time of day of the complains, if
around 9:00pm or maybe later on, 12:30 am or quarter to 1:00 am or 2:00 am. Lt. McCarthy said that
just out of memory 2 of them were around 11:00 pm, another one around 12:30 am, the other one, not
sure. 
Ms. Wadland had comments regarding the noise ordinance if that is being violated. Lt. McCarthy stated
that they Police Dept. suggest that the entertainment hours do not go further than the Liquor hours. 
.
Ms. Wadland stated that she was looking at the alcohol and Vic license hours and how they align with
the proposed entertainment hours, Ms. Wadland made a motion to approve the extension of hours in the
entertained license to align with the hours of the Vic and liquor license, pending inspectional services
approval. Ms. Potter second. 
Lt. Mc Carty clarified that all patrons need to be out the premises at the closing hours, last call is 15
minutes before closing hours.
