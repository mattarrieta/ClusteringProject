7. The Tenant will pay the Base Rent on or before the first of each and every month of the Term to the
Landlord. 
8. No acceptance by the Landlord of any amount less than the full amount owed will be taken to
operate as a waiver by the Landlord for the full amount or in any way to defeat or affect the rights
and remedies of the Landlord to pursue the full amount. 
Use and Occupation
9. The Tenant will open the whole of the Premises for business to the public fully fixtured, stocked and
staffed on the date of commencement of the Term and throughout the Term, and will continuously
occupy and utilize the entire Premises in the active conduct of its business in a reputable manner on
such days and during such hours of business as may be determined from time to time by the
Landlord. 
10. The Tenant covenants that the Tenant will carry on and conduct its business from time to time

regulations of any federal, state, municipal or other competent authority and will not do anything on
or in the Premises in contravention of any of them. 
11. The Tenant covenants that the Tenant will carry on and conduct its business from time to time
carried on upon the Premises in such manner as to comply with any statute, including any
subordinate legislation, which is in force now or in the future and taking into account any
amendment or re-enactment, or any government department, local authority, other public or
competent authority or court of competent jurisdiction and of the insurers in relation to the use, 
occupation and enjoyment of the Building (including in relation to health and safety compliance with
the proper practice recommended by all appropriate authorities).
Quiet Enjoyment
12. The Landlord covenants that on paying the Rent and performing the covenants contained in this
Lease, the Tenant will peacefully and quietly have, hold, and enjoy the Premises for the agreed term.

reserved or deemed as Rent, or any part of the Rent, the Landlord may, without notice or any form of
Page 45
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6D5F1B9D-DED2-4494-A538-AFEB655ED8DE
Commercial Lease Agreement  Page 4 of 7
legal process, enter upon the Premises and seize, remove and sell the Tenant's goods, chattels and
equipment from the Premises or seize, remove and sell any goods, chattels and equipment at any
place to which the Tenant or any other person may have removed them, in the same manner as if
they had remained and been distrained upon the Premises, all notwithstanding any rule of law or
equity to the contrary, and the Tenant hereby waives and renounces the benefit of any present or
future statute or law limiting or eliminating the Landlord's right of distress. 
Overholding
14. If the Tenant continues to occupy the Premises without the written consent of the Landlord at the
expiration or other termination of the Term, then the Tenant will be a tenant at will and will pay to
the Landlord, as liquidated damages and not as rent, an amount equal to twice the Base Rent plus any
Additional Rent during the period of such occupancy, accruing from day to day and adjusted pro rata
accordingly, and subject always to all the other provisions of this Lease insofar as they are applicable
to a tenancy at will and a tenancy from month to month or from year to year will not be created by
implication of law; provided that nothing in this clause contained will preclude the Landlord from
taking action for recovery of possession of the Premises. 
Utilities and Other Costs
15. The Tenant is responsible for the direct payment of the following utilities and other charges in
relation to the Premises: electricity, natural gas, water and sewer. 
Insurance
16. The Tenant is hereby advised and understands that the personal property of the Tenant is not insured
by the Landlord for either damage or loss, and the Landlord assumes no liability for any such loss. 
The Tenant is advised that, if insurance coverage is desired by the Tenant, the Tenant should inquire
of Tenant's insurance agent regarding a Tenant's policy of insurance. 
Abandonment
17. If at any time during the Term, the Tenant abandons the Premises or any part of the Premises, the
Landlord may, at its option, enter the Premises by any means without being liable for any
prosecution for such entering, and without becoming liable to the Tenant for damages or for any
payment of any kind whatever, and may, at the Landlord's discretion, as agent for the Tenant, relet
the Premises, or any part of the Premises, for the whole or any part of the then unexpired Term, and
may receive and collect all rent payable by virtue of such reletting, and, at the Landlord's option, 
hold the Tenant liable for any difference between the Rent that would have been payable under this
Lease during the balance of the unexpired Term, if this Lease had continued in force, and the net rent
for such period realized by the Landlord by means of the reletting. If the Landlord's right of reentry
Page 46
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6D5F1B9D-DED2-4494-A538-AFEB655ED8DE
Commercial Lease Agreement  Page 5 of 7
is exercised following abandonment of the premises by the Tenant, then the Landlord may consider
any personal property belonging to the Tenant and left on the Premises to also have been abandoned, 
in which case the Landlord may dispose of all such personal property in any manner the Landlord
will deem proper and is relieved of all liability for doing so. 
Governing Law
18. It is the intention of the Parties to this Lease that the tenancy created by this Lease and the
performance under this Lease, and all suits and special proceedings under this Lease, be construed in
accordance with and governed, to the exclusion of the law of any other forum, by the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to the jurisdiction in which any action or special
proceeding may be instituted. 
Severability
19. If there is a conflict between any provision of this Lease and the applicable legislation of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the 'Act'), the Act will prevail and such provisions of the Lease
will be amended or deleted as necessary in order to comply with the Act. Further, any provisions that
are required by the Act are incorporated into this Lease. 
Assignment and Subletting
20. The Tenant will not assign this Lease, or sublet or grant any concession or license to use the
Premises or any part of the Premises. An assignment, subletting, concession, or license, whether by
operation of law or otherwise, will be void and will, at Landlord's option, terminate this Lease. 
Bulk Sale
21. No bulk sale of goods and assets of the Tenant may take place without first obtaining the written
consent of the Landlord, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld so long as the Tenant and
the Purchaser are able to provide the Landlord with assurances, in a form satisfactory to the
Landlord, that the Tenant’s obligations in this Lease will continue to be performed and respected, in
the manner satisfactory to the Landlord, after completion of the said bulk sale. 
Care and Use of Premises
22. The Tenant will promptly notify the Landlord of any damage, or of any situation that may
significantly interfere with the normal use of the Premises. 
23. Vehicles which the Landlord reasonably considers unsightly, noisy, dangerous, improperly insured, 
inoperable or unlicensed are not permitted in the Tenant's parking stall(s), and such vehicles may be
Page 47
DocuSign Envelope ID: 6D5F1B9D-DED2-4494-A538-AFEB655ED8DE
Commercial Lease Agreement  Page 6 of 7
towed away at the Tenant's expense. Parking facilities are provided at the Tenant's own risk. The
Tenant is required to park in only the space allotted to them. 
24. The Tenant will not make (or allow to be made) any noise or nuisance which, in the reasonable
opinion of the Landlord, disturbs the comfort or convenience of other tenants. 
25. The Tenant will not engage in any illegal trade or activity on or about the Premises. 
26. The Landlord and Tenant will comply with standards of health, sanitation, fire, housing and safety as
required by law. 
Surrender of Premises
27. At the expiration of the lease term, the Tenant will quit and surrender the Premises in as good a state
and condition as they were at the commencement of this Lease, reasonable use and wear and
damages by the elements excepted. 
Hazardous Materials
28. The Tenant will not keep or have on the Premises any article or thing of a dangerous, flammable, or
explosive character that might unreasonably increase the danger of fire on the Premises or that might
be considered hazardous by any responsible insurance company. 
Rules and Regulations
29. The Tenant will obey all rules and regulations posted by the Landlord regarding the use and care of
the Building, parking lot and other common facilities that are provided for the use of the Tenant in
and around the Building on the Premises. 
General Provisions
30. Any waiver by the Landlord of any failure by the Tenant to perform or observe the provisions of this
Lease will not operate as a waiver of the Landlord's rights under this Lease in respect of any
subsequent defaults, breaches or nonperformance and will not defeat or affect in any way the
Landlord's rights in respect of any subsequent default or breach. 
31. This Lease will extend to and be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective heirs, 
executors, administrators, successors and assigns, as the case may be, of each party to this Lease. All
covenants are to be construed as conditions of this Lease. 
32. All sums payable by the Tenant to the Landlord pursuant to any provision of this Lease will be
deemed to be Additional Rent and will be recoverable by the Landlord as rental arrears. 
33. Where there is more than one Tenant executing this Lease, all Tenants are jointly and severally liable
for each other's acts, omissions and liabilities pursuant to this Lease.

34. Time is of the essence in this Lease. 
35. This Lease will constitute the entire agreement between the Landlord and the Tenant. Any prior
understanding or representation of any kind preceding the date of this Lease will not be binding on
either party to this Lease except to the extent incorporated in this Lease. In particular, no warranties
of the Landlord not expressed in this Lease are to be implied.

seal, or by a duly authorized officer under seal, on this 15th day of September, 2018
