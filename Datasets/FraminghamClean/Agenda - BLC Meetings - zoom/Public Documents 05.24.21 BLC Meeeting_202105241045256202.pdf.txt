Article V: 
Section 32 
Health and Safety
Nuisance Noise Ordinance
Effective January 1, 2020
32.01 Purpose
The Massachusetts Association of Health Boards finds that chronic or repeated exposure
to excessive noise is recognized by public health experts as a hazard to both physical
and mental health. It has been linked to a range of non-auditory health effects including
annoyance, sleep disturbance, cardiovascular diseases, and impairment of cognitive
performance in children. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988259~ 
The purpose of this Noise Ordinance is to allow the City of Framingham, Massachusetts
(the City) to establish reasonable guidelines, restrictions and limitations to maintain
acceptable noise conditions within the City. 
This ordinance defines noise criteria limits and restrictions for the purposes of (1) 
maintaining acceptable existing conditions, equipment operations, social interactions, 
and avoidance of disruption of the peace, and (2) managing and controlling potential
future noise conditions in the City stemming from development of new properties, 
equipment operations, and infrastructure. 
This ordinance is not intended to define safe noise levels to protect people's hearing or
avoid auditory damages from loud noises either within the workplace or from private
activities. As such, this ordinance is not intended to maintain public health and safety
with respect to noise. 
To enforce this Ordinance, the City may seek civil penalties pursuant to M.G.L. c. 40, §
21D and/or misdemeanor criminalpenalties permitted under M.G.L. c. 272, § 53, and
may seek injunctions to prohibit current and future noise. 
Therefore, it shall be unlawful for a person or persons to knowingly generate, or allow
continued generation of noise levels which exceed the criteria limits found in Section
32.03, 32.04 32.05 or 32.06, except under conditions defined in Section 32.09, when
measured at a receiving party's property line or at any location on the receiving
property, as defined by the applicable Noise Determination methods found in Sections
32.07 and 32.08
Nuisance Noise Ordinance  Page 1of 12
Page 107
32.02A Acoustical Terms Definitions
Community noise is generated by natural and man-made sources such as transportation
systems, industrial processes, construction operations, building air handling systems, 
power generation, agricultural processes, landscaping machinery, human activities, 
meteorological conditions, etc. In general, noise can be quantified by its magnitudinal
(loudness), tonal (frequency) and temporal (time) characteristics. The following are
definitions of terms typically used to describe community noise: 
SOUND DEFINITIONS
SOUND is a physical parameter which is produced when a vibrating surface transfers
energy in the form of air pressure waves which fluctuate above and below barometric
pressure to such a degree and within a frequency range that it can be perceived by the
human auditory system (i.e. sound can be heard.)
SOUND LEVEL METER (SLM)—Asound level meter is a calibrated electrical device used
to measure the loudness of noise. For the purposes of this bylaw, a SLM must be
capable of measuring and expressing noise levels in A-weighted decibels using an RMS
"slow" time constant in accordance with Type 2 or better accuracy requirements of ANSI
Standard S1.4. In addition, an "integrating" SLM must be used if any time-averaged
noise metrics (such as Leq or Ln percentiles) are to be reported. 
AUDIBLE FREQUENCY RANGE (and A-weighting) —Human beings can perceive noise
only if the fluctuating air pressure waves are within the so-called "audible frequency
range" of about 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz (Hertz, orcycles-per-second). However, people do
not hear noise equally well at all frequencies. As such, a frequency weighting
adjustment has been standardized in ANSI Standard S1.42 to account for humans
responding less sensitively to lower and higher frequency ranges. This frequency
weighted adjustment is referred to as "A-weighting", with results expressed as A-
weighted decibels, or d6(A).
DECIBELS (dB) —The magnitude or loudness of noise is expressed in units of decibels
(d6). Decibels relate the actual fluctuating air pressure levels against a standardized
reference air pressure level of 20micro-pascals. Human beings can hear noise over a
tremendously large range of air pressure so the use of a decibel scale (from about 0 dB
to 140 dB) is used for convenience. Zero decibels represents the "threshold of hearing",
while at the other extreme, pain and hearing damage can occur at noise levels of about
140 decibels. 
EQUIVALENT SOUND LEVEL (Leq) —The Leq represents the energy-averaged noise level
over some time period of interest. The Leq is expressed in dBA, and the time period
over which the Leq value applies should also be stated, i.e., Leq (lmin) represents a one-
minute average; Leq (24h) represents a 24-hour average, etc. 
Nuisance Noise Ordinance  Page Z of 12
Page 108
PURE TONE —Any sound which can be distinctly heard as a single pitch or a set of single
pitches. For the purposes of this chapter, a "pure tone" shall exist if an octave-band
analysis indicates one octave-band or more over both the band above and below. 
TONAL SOUND -Any sound that is judged by a listener to have the characteristics of a
pure tone, whine, hum or buzz. 
NOISE DEFINITIONS
NOISE is defined as "unwanted sound" which can occur when a source is either too
loud, uncontrollable, conveys unwanted information, masks-out other desirable sound, 
occurs at unacceptable times, or has annoying characteristics. 
BACKGROUND NOISE — is the prevailing or pre-existing noise conditions that can be
measured at a given location of interest without the contribution the noise source of
concern. 
CLEARLY AUDIBLE -means any sound that can be detected by a person using his or her
unaided hearing faculties. (As an example, if the sound source under investigation is a
portable or personal vehicular sound amplification or reproduction device, the
enforcement officer need not determine the title of a song, specific words, or the artist
performing the song. The detection of the rhythmic bass component of the music is
sufficient to constitute a clearly audible sound).
NOISE POLLUTION — A condition caused by a noise source that increases noise levels
ten (10) dB(A) or more above background noise level except that it the noise source
produces a tonal sound an increase at five (5) dB(A) or more above background noise
level shall be considered sufficient to cause noise pollution. 
NUISANCE NOISE —Nuisance typically exhibits aspects such as pure tone squealing or
whining, loud impulsive noises, repetitive thumping, low-frequency airborne vibrations, 
etc. Nuisance noise is defined qualitatively by listing specific examples, as in Section
32.03 of this Ordinance. 
STATIONERY NOISE SOURCE —Sources that emit noise on a continuous or repeatable
basis and that are located in fixed positions. Example stationary noise sources would
include, but are not limited to, building mechanical (HVAC) systems, power
transformers, commercial processing machinery, etc. 
Nuisance Noise Ordinance  Page 3 of 12

12. Construction and/or demolition activities. It is understood that construction and
demolition are inherently noisy activities which will likely be heard by adjacent
residents and business operators. As such, the intent is to balance the needs for
the construction contractors to perform the necessary work with the needs of
the community for peace and quiet. (See Table #2 -Construction Noise Criteria
Limits -for Hours.)
32.04 Stationary Noise Sources
Stationary sources of noise may include, but are not limited to, building HVAC systems, 
power generation facilities, industrial equipment, water or sewage pump stations,

Section 32.05 Construction Noise Sources
In general, construction and/or demolition activities shall only be permitted to occur
within the City during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. However, it is understood that
construction and demolition are inherently noisy activities which will likely be heard by
adjacent residents and business operators during short periods of time. As such, the
intent of this section is to balance the needs for the construction contractors to perform
the necessary work with the needs of the community for peace and quiet. 
Therefore, cumulative noise generated by construction and/or demolition activities and
operations shall not exceed the limits contained in Table 2 when evaluated at the
property line of the receiving property, nor shall the noise emission level of any
individual piece of construction equipment exceed the noise emission limits contained
in Table 2 when measured at a distance of 50 feet from the loudest side of the piece of
equipment.

32.07 Nuisance Noises Determination
It shall be unlawful to knowingly generate, or allow continued generation of, noise as
listed in Section 32.03. 
To be applicable, the police officer must hear for him/herself the noise source in
question. The police officer must take conditional, circumstantial and extenuating
factors into account. Time of day is not to be considered an extenuating circumstance. 
The following are examples of extenuating circumstances: 
1. The necessity of the noise source to continue to operate. 
2. The quality of the noise, e.g., volume, pitch, and intensity of the noise
complained of. 
3. The duration of time that the noise is expected to continue. 
32.08 Noise Compliance Measurements Determination
If fines do not result in compliance with this ordinance, or it becomes necessary to
collect quantitative noise level measurements in order to demonstrate compliance or
exceedance of the various noise criteria limits contained in this ordinance, they must be
collected in accordance with accepted practices and procedures as recommended in
ASTM Standards E1686-03, E1780-04, and E1014-84, using a sound level meter (SLM) 
capable of meeting or exceeding ANSI Standard S1.4 for Type 2 accuracy. 
Nuisance Noise Ordinance  Page 9 of 12
Page 115
Noise data shall be collected using a calibrated SLM using a "slow" time constant with
results expressed in A-weighted decibels (dBAs). The minimum information necessary
to collect and report shall include the following: 
1. The make and model of SLM and portable calibrator used for the noise readings
2. The date which the SLM was last certified by the manufacturer, or other
independent calibration laboratory, as meeting ANSI S1.4StandardsforType 2
or better accuracy requirements (should be within previous two years).
3. TheSLM calibration readings obtained prior to, and immediately following, 
performing the compliance noise measurements. 
4. The type of windscreen used to cover the microphone. 
5. The height at which the noise readings were collected (should be at least 5 feet
above ground), and an estimate of the distance (in feet) from the noise source to
the SLM. 
6. The time of day, date, and duration of noise data collected by the SLM.

ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES CONTROL COMMISSION ADVISORY
REGARDING THE END OF COVID-RELATED RESTRICTIONS
On May 17, 2021, Governor Charlie Baker announced the lifting of COVID-related restrictions and the
expected date for the end of the Commonwealth’s state of emergency. The details of the Governor’s plans
can be found [URL: "https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-to-lift-covid-restrictions-may-29-state-to-meet-vaccination-goal-by-beginning-of-june"] HERE .
Beginning Saturday, May 29, 2021, all COVID-related restrictions for licensees are lifted and all licensees
can resume normal operations. 
The Governor’s COVID-19 State of Emergency will end Monday, June 15, 2021. The end of the state of
emergency brings with it two important changes: 
Patios/Outdoor Expansions: licensees that have been approved for expanded patio/outdoor
service pursuant to the Governor’s executive orders may continue their outdoor operations for 60
days after the end of the state of emergency, which is Sunday, August 15, 2021. 
The Governor and the Legislature are working on legislation to extend this deadline. However, no
extension has yet been approved. Licensees that seek to continue patio/outdoor service after August
15, 2021, are encouraged to apply in the ordinary course for an alteration of premises with their
local licensing authorities. 
Takeaway/delivery of alcohol: establishments licensed for on-premises consumption of alcohol
must end takeaway and delivery sales of alcohol on June 15, 2021. 
Anyone with questions, comments, or concerns about the end of the state of emergency and its impacts on
licensees should contact the Governor’s Office by calling 2-1-1. 
We thank licensees and the local licensing authorities for all their support and compliance during this state
of emergency; we understand this has been a trying time for the entire industry. We continue to be available
to local licensing authorities and licensees going forward. 
Local licensing authorities are reminded that on May 26, 2021, at 10:00 a.m., the ABCC is hosting a virtual
meeting to answer any questions and address concerns from local licensing authorities. All are encouraged
to attend. This call will be recorded for those who cannot attend live. 
As always, all licensees must ensure that they comply with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and that sales of alcoholic beverages take place only as authorized by federal, state, and
local law. All questions should be directed to the ABCC Executive Director Ralph Sacramone at
 rsacramone@tre.state.ma.us or (617) 727-3040 x 731.
