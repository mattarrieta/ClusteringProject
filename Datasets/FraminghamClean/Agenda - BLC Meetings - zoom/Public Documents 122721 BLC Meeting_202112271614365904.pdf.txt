Subject: RE: Framingham Licensing Commission Restated Rules and Regulations 
 
Dear Commissioner Lipton, Thank you for your email. The 7th edition was approved by the License
Commission following the former Chair, Adam Barnosky’s, review.

Page 4
The attached Amended and Restated 7th edition of the Alcohol Rules and Regulations was presented to the
Commission for vote to correct typographical and formatting errors in the 7th edition. One of the errors was the
inadvertent retention of the phrase “Imposition of Monetary Fines” on page 17 that was meant to be removed
with the deletion of Article XV. See the 6th edition for comparison. 
The 7th edition was proposed after several discussions between this office and Ralph Sacramone, the Executive
Director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission (“ABCC”). Mr. Sacramone clarified that the attached
1997 amendment to M.G.L. c. 138 § 64A allows local licensing authority to impose sanctions, but not monetary
penalties. Per Mr. Sacramone, in the event that a local licensing does impose fines, those fines must be remitted
to the ABCC, and may not be retained by the municipality. 
The source of confusion is that while M.G.L. c. 138 § 62 reads “A violation by any person of any provision of
this chapter for which a specific penalty is not provided or a violation by a licensee or permitted of any
provision of his license or permit or of any regulation made under authority of this chapter shall be punished by
a fine of not less than fifty nor more than five hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not less than one month
nor more than one year, or both.”
The ABCC reads M.G.L. c. 138 § 62 to mean that only it, not local licensing authorities to impose (or retain) 
fines. Further under 204 CMR 20, only the ABCC is empowered to offer a fine in lieu of license suspension. 
In our opinion, the Police Department’s investigation fee is not a fine or penalty, but rather an administrative fee
that is authorized under M.G.L. c. 138, § 17 ( . . .  All fees for licenses and permits authorized to be granted by
the local licensing authorities under this chapter shall be paid into the treasuries of their respective cities and
towns. 
I have called Mr. Sacramone to confirm the information above in anticipation of your December 27, 2021
meeting. 
Please let us know if you need a further response. Sincerely, 
Amanda Zuretti

[EXTERNAL SENDER]  
 
 
 
 Dear Attorney Zuretti, 
  
          I hope this message finds you well.  During the December 13, 2021 public meeting, the Board of License 
Commissioners (the “Board”) considered for approval the Amended and Restated Revision 7 to Framingham Rules & 
Regulations Governing Alcoholic Beverages (the “Restated Rules”).  During this meeting none of the commissioners 
could recall having agreed upon deleting the provision authorizing the Board to impose monetary fines in Article VIX, 
section 3.a.  Accordingly, the board voted 5‐0 to approve the Restated Rules, with the exception of the deleted provision 
which was left intact.         
  
              Our discussion did however raise additional questions among the Board members regarding to whom such fines 
are paid.  As it is the Board’s understanding that any monetary fines issued by the Board must, by law, be paid to the 
ABCC, a question was raised as to whether the Board might alternatively have the authority to impose a 
“reimbursement fee” to be paid to the Framingham Police Department, or the City’s general fund, to reimburse the 
Department for its costs incurred conducting its investigation into the license violation.  The Board noted that G.L. c. 138 
§ 62 provides for fines of not less than $50 but not more than $500 for any violation of c. 138. However, it was not clear 
to the Board whether it had  authority to issue these fines directly.   The Board would kindly request your legal opinion 
as to whether, and under what circumstances, it may have authority to impose a reimbursement fee, or some other 
penalty, which would not be a “monetary fine” required to be turned over to the ABCC, so as  to allow us to make a 
better informed decision as to whether to retain, amend or remove the provision in the Restated Rules.  If you have any 
questions for the Board or would like to discuss this matter, please do attend our next meeting by Zoom on December 
27 at 7:00 PM.   We thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

applicant offers, in addition to alcoholic beverages, a variety of non-alcoholic beverages (or
beverages containing on ly trace amounts of alcoh ol), such as mocktai ls, craf tsodas, teas, 
kombuch a, and non- alcoh olic beer and win e, which ar e distinct from traditional non-alcoh olic
beverages (water, soda, juice, etc.).
7. Proposals for off-premises retail establishments to be located in shopping malls or high-
density retail areas, either as new Licenses or transfers, are discouraged if the applicant’s
proposed License application duplicates or is similar to Licensed Premises presently located
in the area. 
VIII. Modifications to Licensed Premises
Once a License is issued, no material physical changes to the Licensed Premises shall be made without the
prior approval of the Board. For the purpose of these Regulations, a material physical change shall be
considered a change in location or number of seats, location of bar, addition or reduction in square footage, or
any other change sufficient to require a building permit from the City of Framingham. 
IX. Transfers of License
Licensees may request that their License be transferred to a third party. A $500 fee shall accompany each
application for ownership or transfer of location. Applications for transfer of ownership or location shall be
processed similarly to an original License application and the Board is not required to grant such transfer
requests. Approval of a transfer of majority ownership further may be conditioned upon the proof of
payment of all outstanding local, state, and federal taxes including, without limiting, the following: receipts
showing remittance to the proper taxing authorities of sales taxes, excise taxes and withheld federal and state
income taxes. Transfers of ownership to trustees in Bankruptcy, court- appointed receivers, or to assignees
for the benefit of the creditors and those taking title or possession of the Licensed Premises by, through or
under them will not be deemed to transfer or convey any rights to the license or the renewal or transfer of
such license, unless provided by contrary superior law. Bona fide mortgagees in possession who are listed in
the application as holding such interest shall be treated in the same manner as the original majority
ownership license. A public hearing shall be required for any transfers of ownership or location, including, 
but not limited to transfers to mortgagees. 
X.  Distribution of Regulations
These Regulations, in their most updated form, shall be provided to all Licensees upon issuance of
their License and, further, shall be regularly available at the City of Framingham Licensing Department and
online at the City of Framingham Board of License Commissioner’s webpage. These Regulations shall be
appended to each annual license issued by the Board. The Licensee may not pick up his/her annual license
until the Licensee has signed a receipt acknowledging that a copy of these Regulations has been received. A
copy of the most updated Regulations shall be maintained on the Licensed Premises at all times and shall be
available for inspection upon request.

> HOUSE BILL NO. 1300 
Synopsis 
AN ACT FURTHER REGULATING LICENSES AUTHORIZING THE SALE OF ALCOHOLIC
BEVERAGES. 
Text 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives in General Court assembled, and by the authority
of the same, as follows: 
SECTION 1. Chapter 138 of the General Laws is hereby amended by inserting after section 64 of the
following two sections:--
Section 64A. In any hearing by the licensing authorities pursuant to the first paragraph of section 64, where
the licensing authorities find that a licensee pursuant to section 12 has served or sold alcohol or alcoholic
beverages either to a person under 21 years of age in violation of section 64 or to an intoxicated person in
violation of section 69 within the 24 months immediately preceding the date of the alleged violation which
is the subject of the hearing, such licensing authorities may, in addition to imposing any other sanctions, 
require as a condition precedent to any modification, reinstatement or renewal of such license thereafter that
the licensee provide a certificate of insurance for liquor liability providing security for the liability of the
licensee to a limit of not less than $ 100,000 to any one person and $ 200,000 to all persons. Said limits
may be increased at the discretion of the licensing authorities. 
Section 64B. In any case in which a liquor liability insurance policy has been required as a condition
precedent to modification, reinstatement or renewal of a license as provided in section 64A or section 67, a
licensee shall disclose to the insurer that such policy is required by the licensing authorities pursuant to said
section 64A or 67, shall provide to the liquor liability insurer the mailing address of the licensing authorities
and shall direct said insurer to include said authorities as a recipient of any notice which the insurer is
required to issue to the licenses pursuant to chapter 175. In any case in which the insurer notifies the licensee
and the licensing authorities that it intends to terminate the contract upon expiration of the requisite notice
period, the licensee shall provide proof of reinstatement or new insurance to the licensing authorities within

such period. If the licensee fails to provide such proof prior to receipt by the licensing authorities of a notice
of cancellation from the insurer, the licensing authorities shall suspend such license until proof of insurance
is delivered, or revoke such license, at their discretion. 
SECTION 2. Section 67 of said chapter 138, as appearing in the 1996 Official Edition, is hereby
amended by inserting after the fifth paragraph the following paragraph:--
In any case in which the commission finds during said hearing that the licensee pursuant to section 12 has
served or sold alcohol or alcoholic beverages to either a person under 21 years of age in violation of section
64 or to an intoxicated person in violation of section 69 within the 24 months immediately preceding the
date of the alleged violation which is the subject of the hearing, said commission may, in addition to any
other sanctions or conditions it may impose, require as a condition precedent to any modification, 
reinstatement or renewal of said license thereafter that the licensee provide a certificate of insurance for
liquor liability of the licensee to a limit of not less than $ 100,000 to any one person and $ 200,000 to all
persons. In any other case in which the commission may act pursuant to this section, it may increase, but
not decrease, the limits of liquor liability insurance, if any, required by the local licensing authorities as a
condition precedent to the modification, reinstatement or renewal of a license. 
SECTION 3. Chapter 175 of the General Laws is hereby amended by striking out section 112B, as so
appearing, and inserting in place thereof the following section:--
Section 112B. Effective 60 days after the inception of a liquor liability insurance contract, no notice of
intention to terminate the contract or, if the contract is a renewal, no notice of intention not to renew the
contract shall be effective unless the insurer at least 60 days prior to the effective date of cancellation or the
end of the contract period, as the case may be, mails or delivers to the insured, and to the licensing authorities
or the alcoholic beverages control commission pursuant to section 64A or 67 of chapter 138, at the address
shown on the policy such notice of intention not to renew, except where cancellation is for nonpayment of
premium, or where the insured has lost his license. If cancellation is for nonpayment of premium pertaining
to contracts required pursuant to section 64A, 64B or 67 of said chapter 138, the insurer shallnot cancel
such liquor liability insurance except upon 30 days prior written notice to the licensee and the local licensing
authorities.
