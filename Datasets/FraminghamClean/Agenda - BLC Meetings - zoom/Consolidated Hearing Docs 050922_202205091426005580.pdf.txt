By virtue of the authority contained in Chapter 138 of the Massachusetts General Laws (“Chapter
138”), and Article V, Section 1 of the City of Framingham General Ordinances (the “Ordinances”), the
Board of License Commissioners of the City of Framingham, serving as the City’sLiquor Licensing
Authority (the “Board”) hereby promulgates these Rules and Regulations Governing Alcoholic Beverages
(“Regulations”). The Regulations shall supersede all previous regulations or policies issued by the City of
Framingham (the “City”), or, collectively as the preceding licensing authority, the Town of Framingham
and/or Board of Selectmen. The Board has the power under the Ordinances and the laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts to amend these Regulations periodically from time to time as it sees fit. 
For the purposes hereof, the Regulations, Ordinances, and Chapter 138 shall be collectively referred to as
the “Laws”.
Any license issued for the sale in any manner of any alcoholic beverages (a “License”) shall be
issued on the condition of full compliance with these Regulations. The failure to comply with the Laws and
other Ordinances or rules issued by the City and/or the Board shall constitute sufficient cause or grounds for
refusing to grant the license, or for suspending, canceling, modifying, or revoking such license or permit
already granted, in accordance with Article XIV herein. Any individual, organization, or company licensed
by the Board pursuant to the Laws shall be referred to herein as a “Licensee”.
Any premises licensed by the Board pursuant to the Laws shall be referred to as the “Licensed
Premises”.
I.  Consumption of Alcoholic Beverages
Public consumption of alcoholic beverages as defined in Chapter 138, Section 1 is permitted only in
accordance with an appropriate License issued by the Board. Absent an appropriate License issued by the
Board, it is prohibited to drink any alcoholic beverage while on, in or upon any public way or upon any way
to which the public has a right of access; any place to which members of the public have access as invitees
or licensees; a park or playground. It is prohibited to drink any alcoholic beverage while on, in or upon or
private land or place without consent of the owner or person in control thereof. All alcoholic beverages used
in violation of this shall be seized and safely held until final adjudication of the charge against the person or
persons arrested or summoned before the court, at which time they shall be returned to the person entitled to
lawful possession.
Page 125
II.  General Provisions Regarding the Administration of Licensed Premises
1.  Licensure Requirements. The applicant for any type of License must meet the
requirements of the Laws.
2.  Alcohol Training Program. The Licensee shall require all employees serving alcohol or

beverage server training program which has been approved by the Board (the “Alcohol
Training Program”). The requirement set forth in the preceding sentence shall include and

viewing identification cards to determine the age of patrons for service of alcoholic
beverages.
The Alcohol Training Program may be completed on-line. The Licensee shall require all
employees engaged in serving alcoholic beverages and/or viewing of identification cards to
obtain Alcohol Training Program certification within thirty (30) days of employment and
the Manager shall maintain a list of employee certifications. To the extent an employee
serves alcohol or views identification cards prior to obtaining Alcohol Training Program
certification, the Manager of Record, as defined by Chapter 138, Section 26 (the
“Manager”), will be personally responsible for that employee, and any violation of these
regulations committed by the employee will be treated as if the Manager and/or Licensee
had committed the violation. Managers and Assistant Managers shall obtain Alcohol
Training Program certification prior to assuming the duties of Manager or Assistant
Manager. The Licensee shall strongly encourage all alcohol servers to attend periodic
retraining programs at least bi-annually that reinforce the certification training described
herein. The retraining programs underscore the importance of proper server training on the
dangers associated with alcohol abuse on Licensed Premises.

the Licensed Premises. The Licensee shall keep on file at the Licensed Premises photocopies
of the Management ID Cards. Any Manager or Assistant Manager who allegedly violates
any provision of the Laws is required to attend the Board hearing conducted in accordance
with Article XIV herein. Failure to attend said hearing may result in the revocation of the
Manager or Assistant Manager’sID Card by the Framingham Police Department. Violation
of this section shall further subject Licensees and management to penalties under Article
XIV as may be imposed by the Board.

purchasing alcoholic beverages occurs at the point of sale or service. Wristbands, stickers,
or any other kind of markings/marking devices are prohibited as a method of

without the licensed premises, any of the practices prohibited under this

the Regulations and shall subject the Licensee to possible discipline and/or penalties by the
Board in accordance with the procedure set forth in Article XIV herein.
IV. Change of Manager
1.  Timeline Requirements for Filing a Change of Manager Application. An application for
Change of Manager of Record or Assistant Manager must be filed with the Board at least two (2) weeks
before the proposed effective date of the change (“Change of Management Notice Deadline”), unless the
Manager of Record has terminated his or her employment without prior notice to the Licensee or is
terminated by Licensee under circumstances which do not reasonably allow for advance Change of 
Management Deadline Notice (“Early Management Termination”). In the event of Early Management
Termination, the Licensee must, within thirty (30) days of such termination, notify the Board of: (a) the
basic facts surrounding such termination; (ii) the name of the person who will discharge the duties of
Manager pending selection and approval of a new Manager of Record; and
Page 5 of 21
Page 129
(iii) shall file the application for a Change of Manager no more than thirty (30) days after the departure of
the approved Manager of Record. If the Board finds that the circumstances justify the noncompliance with
the Change of Manager Notice Timeline, no penalty will be imposed so long as the Licensee complies with
subsections (i) through (iii) above. If the circumstances for the delay are not found to be sufficient, or if the
application for a Change of Manager is filed more than thirty (30) days after the departure of the Manager of
Record, the Board may impose a penalty or suspension of up to one (1) day of suspension for each day of 
unjustified non-compliance or for each day that passes beyond the passage of thirty (30) days after departure
of the Manager of Record before the application for a new manager is filed, or such other penalty permitted
by Article XIV herein. In addition to the foregoing, the Board shall also have the right to impose penalties
for the failure to provide timely notification of the departure of an Assistant Manager. When submitting an
application for change of Manager or Assistant Manager, the Manager or Assistant Manager shall be certified
as an alcohol server and registered with the Police Department prior to submitting the application. Further, 
approval of a change in Manager may be conditioned upon proof of payment of all outstanding local, state, 
and federal taxes and fees.
2.  Manager Background Checks. Upon receipt of an application for an original License, or, in
the case of a new Manager of Record or Assistant Manager, upon being advised of the new Manager of
Record or Assistant Manager’s identity, the Framingham Police Department will conduct a background
check of any proposed Licensee, Manager of Record or Assistant Manager, and such check will include a
review of any existing criminal record. The Board may reject any application where the Licensee’s, 
Manager of Record’s or Assistant Manager’s criminal record indicates, theft, unlawful drug offense(s) (with
the exception of any criminal arrest or conviction relating to possession of marijuana which predate the
enactment of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 94G), alcohol-related offenses, a propensity for violence,
or other behavior, that, in the opinion of the Board, might disqualify the individual from responsibly
carrying out their duties as Manager of Record or would otherwise put the public at risk.
3.  Violations. A violation of any of subsection 1 regarding change of Manager shall 
constitute a violation of these Regulations and shall subject the Licensee to possible discipline and/or
penalties in accordance with this section or with Article XIV herein.
V.  Responsibilities of Manager of Record:
1.  Authority & Control of Licensed Premises. The Board regards the Manager of Record of
Licensed Premises as the principal representative of the Licensee and as having full authority and control of
the Licensed Premises and of the conduct of all business therein relative to alcoholic beverages, all as
provided in the Laws. An Assistant Manager or other suitable managerial employee capable of fulfilling the
duties of Manager of Record must be listed on the License by the Licensee. This will allow for continuity of
the Manager position should either the Manager of Record or Assistant Manager positions become vacant
during the course of the year.
2.  Responsibilities. Without limiting the scope of the previous subsection, the Board will hold
the Manager of Record responsible for the following:
a. Careful selection of qualified employees of the licensed business, including servers, 
clerks and persons who are engaged with the public in any capacity;
Page 6 of 21
Page 130
b. Training of employees in all matters relating to the sale and service of alcoholic
beverages;
c. Assuring that employees serving alcohol to the public have successfully completed an
alcoholic beverage training program for serving alcohol responsibly and strongly
encourage continual training of employees engaged in serving and selling alcoholic
beverages;
d. Ensuring that no criminal activity, including the sale and distribution of narcotic
drugs, takes place on the Licensed Premises, including within any parking area 
ancillary to or serving the Licensed Premises;
e. Promptly reporting to the Police Department all instances of attempted purchases or
procurement of service of alcoholic beverages by minors, including attempts to gain
access to premises upon which alcoholic beverages are served and from which minors
are excluded, and appropriate action taken by the Licensee in response thereto. Such
appropriate action shall include (1) Reporting to the Registry of Motor Vehicles
instances involving possession or use of a false, forged, or counterfeit license to operate
motor vehicles or identification card issued by the Registry of Motor Vehicles; (2) 
confiscation of liquor identification cards or motor vehicle operator’s license presented
by the minor; and (3) if a purchase was made or service was procured, the name of the 
Licensee’s employee participating therein;
f. Enforcement of the Laws with respect to the operation of the licensed business;
g. Ensuring that the Licensed Premises, including the exterior, are kept clean, neat, and
sanitary at all times; and
h. The Board strongly encourages the Manager of Record and/or Assistant Manager to
attend the recommended Annual Alcohol Education Seminar. Failure to attend such

VI. Procedure for Obtaining Liquor Licenses
The applicant for a License of any type should submit a letter to the Board outlining the proposal
with a completed application and include a request for a hearing with the Board. The applicant should
request to be placed on the agenda and publish a public notice of the date selected for the hearing in
accordance with Chapter 138. At a duly noticed public hearing, the Board will consider the application for a
License and the input of any interested members of the public. The Board will then consider the application
and respond in a timely manner to the applicant. The Board shall provide a copy of these Regulations to
each Licensee at the time when they pick up their annual license. The Licensee shall sign a receipt to be
maintained by the Board evidencing their receipt of a copy of these Regulations.
Pursuant to Chapter 138, Section 15A, where there are no premises actually in existence at the time
the application for a License is made, the applicant shall file a plan showing the actual dimensions of
premises which are to be constructed on which the License is to be exercised. A License granted under this
provision shall be upon the condition that such License shall not be issued until completion of the Licensed
Premises in accordance with the plan, and the decision of the Board as to whether the plan has been
complied with shall be final. The Board may include as a condition of such License that the Licensed
Premises be completed in accordance with the plan by a date certain or the License shall be deemed null and
void. Said specified completion date may be extended by the Board in its sole discretion upon written
request by the applicant submitted to the Board at least 45 days prior to the expiration of the initial
anticipated completion date as stated in the License.
VII. Considerations for Approval of New License or Transfer:
The Board will consider any or all of the following that can be reasonably offered in support of a
particular License application:
1. The applicant is a qualified Veterans’ organization and seeks a club license.
2. Subject to applicable zoning requirements, the applicant proposes an establishment that offers
a regular forum for music and musicians to play and obtain exposure for their work.
3. The applicant offers variety, or uniqueness, in its proposed establishment or shop, in
contrast to what exists in the City of Framingham at the time of the application.
4. The applicant demonstrates the elements for public need for the License particular location.
5. The applicant proposes an establishment that offers a substantial economic benefit to the City
of Framingham. 
Page 8 of 21
Page 132
6. Where the application pertains to a License to be issued pursuant to Chapter 138, Section 12, the
applicant offers, in addition to alcoholic beverages, a variety of non-alcoholic beverages (or
beverages containing only trace amounts of alcohol), such as mocktails, craft sodas, teas, 
kombucha, and non-alcoholic beer and wine, which are distinct from traditional non-alcoholic
beverages (water, soda, juice, etc.).
7. Proposals for off-premises retail establishments to be located in shopping malls or high-
density retail areas, either as new Licenses or transfers, are discouraged if the applicant’s
proposed License application duplicates or is similar to Licensed Premises presently located
in the area.
VIII. Modifications to Licensed Premises
Once a License is issued, no material physical changes to the Licensed Premises shall be made without the
prior approval of the Board. For the purpose of these Regulations, a material physical change shall be
considered a change in location or number of seats, location of bar, addition or reduction in square footage,
or any other change sufficient to require a building permit from the City of Framingham.
IX. Transfers of License
Licensees may request that their License be transferred to a third party. A $500 fee shall accompany each
application for ownership or transfer of location. Applications for transfer of ownership or location shall be
processed similarly to an original License application and the Board is not required to grant such transfer
requests. Approval of a transfer of majority ownership further may be conditioned upon the proof of
payment of all outstanding local, state, and federal taxes including, without limiting, the following: receipts
showing remittance to the proper taxing authorities of sales taxes, excise taxes and withheld federal and state
income taxes. Transfers of ownership to trustees in Bankruptcy, court- appointed receivers, or to assignees 
for the benefit of the creditors and those taking title or possession of the Licensed Premises by, through or
under them will not be deemed to transfer or convey any rights to the license or the renewal or transfer of
such license, unless provided by contrary superior law. Bona fide mortgagees in possession who are listed in
the application as holding such interest shall be treated in the same manner as the original majority
ownership license. A public hearing shall be required for any transfers of ownership or location, including, 
but not limited to transfers to mortgagees.
X.  Distribution of Regulations
These Regulations, in their most updated form, shall be provided to all Licensees upon issuance of
their License and, further, shall be regularly available at the City of Framingham Licensing Department and
online at the City of Framingham Board of License Commissioner’s webpage. These Regulations shall be
appended to each annual license issued by the Board. The Licensee may not pick up his/her annual license
until the Licensee has signed a receipt acknowledging that a copy of these Regulations has been received. A
copy of the most updated Regulations shall be maintained on the Licensed Premises at all times and shall be
available for inspection upon request.

by a government of a foreign country recognized by the United States government, or a

XIV. Penalties, Procedure and Structure for Violations of the Ordinance and Regulations
A.  Purpose
The purpose of this penalty structure is to improve the ability of the Board to prevent alcohol abuse
and violation of the Laws. This Article XIV will help to achieve reasonable uniformity in the imposition of
penalties and to avoid confusion in the minds of the public, patrons, and Licensees due to a lack of
understanding of the consequences of violating the Laws and License terms. This Article XIV is intended to
empower the Board to consider the circumstances of each case and provide a mechanism by which
Licensees can improve their compliance with the Laws in the future.
B.  General Provisions
1. No Illegality on Premises. No Licensee shall permit any illegality to occur on the Licensed
Premises, regardless of whether such illegality relates to the sale and service of alcoholic

City officials in ensuring safe and orderly facilities.

said violation unless the incident is serious enough to comprise public safety and needs
immediate attention at which time Framingham Police shall be notified forthwith. Failure to
report a violation involving the Licensed Premises constitutes a violation of these Regulations
and will subject the Licensee to appropriate discipline in accordance with the procedure set
forth herein.
3. Penalties; Generally. Penalties for offenses shall be in line with the City’s general goals of
protecting public safety and the general welfare. Penalties will also be imposed with the goal of
preventing future offenses. A violation of these Regulations alone (rather than state law or the

permitted under law. The nature and severity of the penalties imposed will be decided
according to the nature of the offense and the presence of mitigating or aggravating
circumstances as further described herein. All offenses by Licensees will result in the
imposition of a penalty of some degree. This will impress upon Licensees, managers, and
servers their responsibility for ensuring compliance with these Regulations, for prevention of
offenses and for compliance with the terms of licenses and the liquor laws of the
Commonwealth.

one or more of the following as appropriate: (a) Revocation of License; (b)

Participation in Alcohol Abuse and Offense Prevention Programs; and/or (g) any
other reasonable penalty, in the Board’s reasonable discretion.

to provide indication of the range of penalties the Board will impose if a hearing is
held on any offense. The Board will refer to these guidelines by deciding whether to
approve a negotiated recommended resolution.

Department is authorized to negotiate with any authorized representative of the Licensee the
terms upon which the Police Department will recommend to the Board that an offense be
resolved.

Manager of Record or designated representative of the Licensee charged with the
offense and approved by the Police Chief. The recommendation must include a
statement detailing the facts determined in the Police Department investigation. The
recommended resolution is not binding upon the City unless and until approved by the
Board.
b. If the Police Department and the Manager of Record and/or an authorized
representative of the Licensee cannot agree on a recommended resolution, the
Page 15 of 21
Page 139
c. Police Department will make any additional investigation it deems necessary for a
complete presentation of the facts and will file a written report with the Board.
d. The Board may consider, but is not required to accept, a negotiated resolution
recommended by the Police Department. The Board is empowered to consider
alternative penalties consistent with this Article XIV and the Laws.

their disposition that will be indexed according to the Licensee, Manager or Assistant
Manager, server and purchaser involved.

Laws. The notice provided to Licensee may contain the Police Department's recommendation to
the Board concerning the punishment for the alleged violation. The notice will include the date of
the event giving rise to the possible disciplinary action, a description of the event, and a clear
identification of the Laws that are alleged to have been violated as a result of the event. Said
notice will also provide Licensee with the date upon which the Board will hold a hearing
concerning the Licensee's  alleged violation. A notice containing the above-mentioned
information shall be sent to Licensee via certified mail return receipt requested no less than ten
(10) days prior to the date of the hearing before the Board. Licensees are entitled to retain
counsel to represent them at the hearing if they so desire.
6. Written Statement of Disciplinary Action. If the Board decides to take disciplinary action against
the Licensee for a violation of the Laws, the Board will provide the Licensee with a statement of
reasons why disciplinary action was taken against Licensee. The above-mentioned statement of
reasons will be included with the notice of the Board’s disciplinary action.
C.  Determination of Penalties
Penalties will be determined according to the following procedure.
1.  The base level offense(s) will be determined from those offenses described in Article XIV,
Section D.
2.  Adjustments according to the presence of factors that warrant an increase in the penalty
described in Article XIV, Section E ("aggravating factors") or decrease described in Article
XIV, Section F (“mitigating factors") will be considered.

By virtue of the authority contained in Chapter 138 of the Massachusetts General Laws
(“Chapter 138”), and Article V, Section 1 of the City of Framingham General Ordinances (the
“Ordinances”), the Board of License Commissioners of the City of Framingham, serving as the City’s
Liquor Licensing Authority (the “Board”) hereby promulgates these Rules and Regulations Governing
Alcoholic Beverages (“Regulations”). The Regulations shall supersede all previous regulations or
policies issued by the City of Framingham (the “City”), or, collectively as the preceding licensing
authority, the Town of Framingham and/or Board of Selectmen. The Board has the power under the
Ordinances and the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to amend these Regulations
periodically from time to time as it sees fit. For the purposes hereof, the Regulations, Ordinances, and
Chapter 138 shall be collectively referred to as the “Laws”.
Any license issued for the sale in any manner of any alcoholic beverages (a “License”) shall be
issued on the condition of full compliance with these Regulations. The failure to comply with the Laws
and other Ordinances or rules issued by the City and/or the Board shall constitute sufficient cause or
grounds for refusing to grant the license, or for suspending, canceling, modifying, or revoking such
license or permit already granted, in accordance with Article XV herein. Any individual, organization, 
or company licensed by the Board pursuant to the Laws shall be referred to herein as a “Licensee”.
Any premises licensed by the Board pursuant to the Laws shall be referred to as the “Licensed
Premises”.
I.  Consumption of Alcoholic Beverages
Public consumption of alcoholic beverages as defined in Chapter 138, Section 1 is permitted
only in accordance with an appropriate License issued by the Board. Absent an appropriate License
issued by the Board, it is prohibited to drink any alcoholic beverage while on, in or upon any public
way or upon any way to which the public has a right of access; any place to which members of the
public have access as invitees or licensees; a park or playground. It is prohibited to drink any alcoholic
beverage while on, in or upon or private land or place without consent of the owner or person in control
thereof. All alcoholic beverages used in violation of this shall be seized and safely held until final
adjudication of the charge against the person or persons arrested or summoned before the court, at
which time they shall be returned to the person entitled to lawful possession.
Page 168
II.  General Provisions Regarding the Administration of Licensed Premises
1.  Licensure Requirements.  The applicant for any type of License must meet the
requirements of the Laws.
2.  Alcohol Training Program. The Licensee shall require all employees serving alcohol
or viewing identifications cards to determine age to successfully complete an alcoholic
beverage server training program which has been approved by the Board (the “Alcohol
Training Program”). The requirement set forth in the preceding sentence shall include
and apply to the Manager (as defined below), Assistant Manager, and all persons
responsible for viewing identification cards to determine the age of patrons for service
of alcoholic beverages.
The Alcohol Training Program may be completed on-line. The Licensee shall require
all employees engaged in serving alcoholic beverages and/or viewing of identification
cards to obtain Alcohol Training Program certification within thirty (30) days of
employment and the Manager shall maintain a list of employee certifications. To the
extent an employee serves alcohol or views identification cards prior to obtaining
Alcohol Training Program certification, the Manager of Record, as defined by Chapter
138, Section 26 (the “Manager”), will be personally responsible for that employee, and
any violation of these regulations committed by the employee will be treated as if the
Manager and/or Licensee had committed the violation. Managers and Assistant
Managers shall obtain Alcohol Training Program certification prior to assuming the
duties of Manager or Assistant Manager. The Licensee shall strongly encourage all
alcohol servers to attend periodic retraining programs at least bi-annually that reinforce
the certification training described herein. The retraining programs underscore the
importance of proper server training on the dangers associated with alcohol abuse on
Licensed Premises.

Cards (the “Management ID Card”) shall be required for all Managers and Assistant
Managers, who shall be registered with the Framingham Police Department prior to
assuming the duties as Manager or Assistant Manager. The Management ID Card shall
be carried on the Manager and Assistant Manager’s person or shall be otherwise be
available for inspection at the Licensed Premises. The Licensee shall keep on file at the
Licensed Premises photocopies of the Management ID Cards. Any Manager or
Assistant Manager who allegedly violates any provision of the Laws is required to
attend the Board hearing conducted in accordance with Article XV herein. Failure to
attend said hearing may result in the revocation of the Manager or Assistant Manager’s
ID Card by the Framingham Police Department. Violation of this section shall further
subject Licensees and management to penalties under Article XV as may be imposed
by the Board.
4.  Identification of Patrons. Licensees shall ensure that the identification of persons
purchasing alcoholic beverages occurs at the point of sale or service. Wristbands, 
stickers, or any other kind of markings/marking devices are prohibited as a method of

beverage to the licensee. An admission charge shall not be credited towards the

without increasing proportionately the price regularly charged for the
drink during the same calendar week.

which involves drinking or the awarding of drinks as prizes.
viii. No licensee shall advertise or promote in any way, whether within or
without the licensed premises, any of the practices prohibited under
this section.
6.  Nothing contained in this Section II.5 shall be construed to prohibit Licensees from
offering free food or entertainment at any time; including a drink as part of a meal
package; the sale or delivery of wine by the bottle or carafe when sold with meals or to
more than one person; or to prohibit those licensed under Chapter 138, Section 15,

IV. Change of Manager
1.  Timeline Requirements for Filing a Change of Manager Application. An
application for Change of Manager of Record or Assistant Manager must be filed with the Board at
least two (2) weeks before the proposed effective date of the change (“Change of Management Notice
Deadline”), unless the Manager of Record has terminated his or her employment without prior notice to
the Licensee or is terminated by Licensee under circumstances which do not reasonably allow for
advance Change of Management Deadline Notice (“Early Management Termination”). In the event
of Early Management Termination, the Licensee must, within thirty (30) days of such termination, 
notify the Board of: (a) the basic facts surrounding such termination; (ii) the name of the person who
will discharge the duties of Manager pending selection and approval of a new Manager of Record; and
Page 5 of 21
Page 172
(iii) shall file the application for a Change of Manager no more than thirty (30) days after the departure
of the approved Manager of Record. If the Board finds that the circumstances justify the noncompliance
with the Change of Manager Notice Timeline, no penalty will be imposed so long as the Licensee
complies with subsections (i) through (iii) above. If the circumstances for the delay are not found to be
sufficient, or if the application for a Change of Manager is filed more than thirty (30) days after the
departure of the Manager of Record, the Board may impose a penalty or suspension of up to one (1) day
of suspension for each day of unjustified non-compliance or for each day that passes beyond the
passage of thirty (30) days after departure of the Manager of Record before the application for a new
manager is filed, or such other penalty permitted by Article XV herein. In addition to the foregoing, the
Board shall also have the right to impose penalties for the failure to provide timely notification of the
departure of an Assistant Manager. When submitting an application for change of Manager or Assistant
Manager, the Manager or Assistant Manager shall be certified as an alcohol server and registered with
the Police Department prior to submitting the application. Further, approval of a change in Manager
may be conditioned upon proof of payment of all outstanding local, state, and federal taxes and fees.
2.  Manager Background Checks. Upon receipt of an application for an original License,
or, in the case of a new Manager of Record or Assistant Manager, upon being advised of the new
Manager of Record or Assistant Manager’s identity, the Framingham Police Department will conduct a
background check of any proposed Licensee, Manager of Record or Assistant Manager, and such check
will include a review of any existing criminal record. The Board may reject any application where the
Licensee’s, Manager of Record’s or Assistant Manager’s criminal record indicates, theft, unlawful drug
offense(s) (with the exception of any criminal arrest or conviction relating to possession of marijuana
which predate the enactment of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 94G), alcohol-related offenses, a
propensity for violence, or other behavior, that, in the opinion of the Board, might disqualify the
individual from responsibly carrying out their duties as Manager of Record or would otherwise put the
public at risk.
3.  Violations. A violation of any of subsection 1 regarding change of Manager shall
constitute a violation of these Regulations and shall subject the Licensee to possible discipline and/or
penalties in accordance with this section or with Article XV herein.
V.  Responsibilities of Manager of Record:
1.  Authority & Control of Licensed Premises.  The Board regards the Manager of
Record of Licensed Premises as the principal representative of the Licensee and as having full authority
and control of the Licensed Premises and of the conduct of all business therein relative to alcoholic
beverages, all as provided in the Laws. An Assistant Manager or other suitable managerial employee
capable of fulfilling the duties of Manager of Record must be listed on the License by the Licensee. 
This will allow for continuity of the Manager position should either the Manager of Record or Assistant
Manager positions become vacant during the course of the year.
2.  Responsibilities. Without limiting the scope of the previous subsection, the Board will
hold the Manager of Record responsible for the following:
a. Careful selection of qualified employees of the licensed business, including servers,
clerks and persons who are engaged with the public in any capacity;
Page 6 of 21
Page 173
b. Training of employees in all matters relating to the sale and service of alcoholic
beverages;
c. Assuring that employees serving alcohol to the public have successfully completed
an alcoholic beverage training program for serving alcohol responsibly and strongly
encourage continual training of employees engaged in serving and selling alcoholic
beverages;
d. Ensuring that no criminal activity, including the sale and distribution of narcotic
drugs, takes place on the Licensed Premises, including within any parking area
ancillary to or serving the Licensed Premises;
e. Promptly reporting to the Police Department all instances of attempted purchases
or procurement of service of alcoholic beverages by minors, including attempts to
gain access to premises upon which alcoholic beverages are served and from which
minors are excluded, and appropriate action taken by the Licensee in response
thereto. Such appropriate action shall include (1) Reporting to the Registry of
Motor Vehicles instances involving possession or use of a false, forged, or
counterfeit license to operate motor vehicles or identification card issued by the
Registry of Motor Vehicles; (2) confiscation of liquor identification cards or motor
vehicle operator’s license presented by the minor; and (3) if a purchase was made
or service was procured, the name of the Licensee’s employee participating
therein;
f. Enforcement of the Laws with respect to the operation of the licensed business;
g. Ensuring that the Licensed Premises, including the exterior, are kept clean, neat, 
and sanitary at all times; and
h. The Board strongly encourages the Manager of Record and/or Assistant Manager
to attend the recommended Annual Alcohol Education Seminar. Failure to attend
such seminar shall not constitute a defense to any violation of the Laws.
3.  Hours of Licensed Premises. Except as provided herein, the Manager of Record
must be a full-time employee or a corporate officer of the Licensee, must be engaged exclusively in
the management of the licensed business, and must be a qualified seller or server of alcoholic
beverages registered with the Framingham Police Department. The Manager of Record shall not
undertake any non-managerial position(s) (i.e., bartender, server, cook) or any other role which
interferes with the Manager of Record’s oversight of the Licensed Premises. The Manager of Record
must be on the Licensed Premises at least forty (40) hours per week in the course of business,
consistent with the permitted hours of operation. When the Manager of Record is not upon the
Licensed Premises, the person in charge of the business must be an Assistant Manager or a qualified
seller or server of alcoholic beverages registered with the Framingham Police Department and
designated by the approved Manager of Record to have charge of the business in the Manager’s
absence. The Manager of Record shall be responsible for the operation of the business whether or not
on the Licensed Premises. When the Manager of Record is not upon the Licensed Premises, a method
Page 7 of 21
Page 174
of contacting the Manager of Record promptly must be arranged so that the Manager of Record can
be reached at all times by the person designated to be in charge of the Licensed Premises. The
provisions of the first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to any Licensee holding a license
issued under Chapter 138, Section 12 to a veterans’ organization or to a Licensee holding a license
issued to a club under Chapter 138, Section 17.
4.  Failure of the Manager of Record to comply with this policy or to properly discharge
the duties of manager may result in removal as Manager or suspension or revocation of the License as
may be appropriate to the circumstances.
VI. Procedure for Obtaining Liquor Licenses
The applicant for a License of any type should submit a letter to the Board outlining the
proposal with a completed application and include a request for a hearing with the Board. The applicant
should request to be placed on the agenda and publish a public notice of the date selected for the
hearing in accordance with Chapter 138. At a duly noticed public hearing, the Board will consider the
application for a License and the input of any interested members of the public. The Board will then
consider the application and respond in a timely manner to the applicant. The Board shall provide a
copy of these Regulations to each Licensee at the time when they pick up their annual license. The
Licensee shall sign a receipt to be maintained by the Board evidencing their receipt of a copy of these
Regulations.
Pursuant to Chapter 138, Section 15A, where there are no premises actually in existence at the
time the application for a License is made, the applicant shall file a plan showing the actual dimensions
of premises which are to be constructed on which the License is to be exercised. A License granted
under this provision shall be upon the condition that such License shall not be issued until completion
of the Licensed Premises in accordance with the plan, and the decision of the Board as to whether the
plan has been complied with shall be final. The Board may include as a condition of such License that
the Licensed Premises be completed in accordance with the plan by a date certain or the License shall
be deemed null and void. Said specified completion date may be extended by the Board in its sole
discretion upon written request by the applicant submitted to the Board at least 45 days prior to the
expiration of the initial anticipated completion date as stated in the License.
VII. Considerations for Approval of New License or Transfer:
The Board will consider any or all of the following that can be reasonably offered in support of a
particular License application:
1. The applicant is a qualified Veterans’ organization and seeks a club license.
2. Subject to applicable zoning requirements, the applicant proposes an establishment that
offers a regular forum for music and musicians to play and obtain exposure for their work.
3. The applicant offers variety, or uniqueness, in its proposed establishment or shop, in
contrast to what exists in the City of Framingham at the time of the application.
4. The applicant demonstrates the elements for public need for the License particular location.
5. The applicant proposes an establishment that offers a substantial economic benefit to the
City of Framingham. 
Page 8 of 21
Page 175
6. Where the application pertains to a License to be issued pursuant to Chapter 138, Section
12, the applicant offers, in addition to alcoholic beverages, a variety of non-alcoholic
beverages (or beverages containing only trace amounts of alcohol), such as mocktails, craft
sodas, teas, kombucha, and non-alcoholic beer and wine, which are distinct from traditional
non-alcoholic beverages (water, soda, juice, etc.).
7. Proposals for off-premises retail establishments to be located in shopping malls or
high-density retail areas, either as new Licenses or transfers, are discouraged if the
applicant’s proposed License application duplicates or is similar to Licensed Premises
presently located in the area.
VIII. Modifications to Licensed Premises
Once a License is issued, no material physical changes to the Licensed Premises shall be made without
the prior approval of the Board. For the purpose of these Regulations, a material physical change shall
be considered a change in location or number of seats, location of bar, addition or reduction in square
footage, or any other change sufficient to require a building permit from the City of Framingham.
IX. Transfers of License
Licensees may request that their License be transferred to a third party. A $500 fee shall accompany
each application for ownership or transfer of location. Applications for transfer of ownership or location
shall be processed similarly to an original License application and the Board is not required to grant
such transfer requests. Approval of a transfer of majority ownership further may be conditioned upon
the proof of payment of all outstanding local, state, and federal taxes including, without limiting, the
following: receipts showing remittance to the proper taxing authorities of sales taxes, excise taxes and
withheld federal and state income taxes. Transfers of ownership to trustees in Bankruptcy, court-
appointed receivers, or to assignees for the benefit of the creditors and those taking title or possession
of the Licensed Premises by, through or under them will not be deemed to transfer or convey any rights
to the license or the renewal or transfer of such license, unless provided by contrary superior law. Bona
fide mortgagees in possession who are listed in the application as holding such interest shall be treated
in the same manner as the original majority ownership license. A public hearing shall be required for
any transfers of ownership or location, including, but not limited to transfers to mortgagees.
X.  Distribution of Regulations
These Regulations, in their most updated form, shall be provided to all Licensees upon issuance
of their License and, further, shall be regularly available at the City of Framingham Licensing
Department and online at the City of Framingham Board of License Commissioner’s webpage. These
Regulations shall be appended to each annual license issued by the Board. The Licensee may not pick
up his/her annual license until the Licensee has signed a receipt acknowledging that a copy of these
Regulations has been received. A copy of the most updated Regulations shall be maintained on the
Licensed Premises at all times and shall be available for inspection upon request.

Page 176
XI. Filing Fees and Annual Licensing Fees
Filing Fees and Annual Licensing Fees shall be determined by the Board and made publicly available at
the administrative offices of the Board at City Hall and online at the Board’s webpage at
 www.framingamma.gov.
XII. Miscellaneous Operating Provisions
1.  Exterior Doors. Exterior doors to the Licensed Premises must remain closed, but not
locked, during all times that the Licensed Premises are open for business.
2.  Access to Licensed Premises.  The Licensee shall ensure that the Framingham Police
Department, the Framingham Fire Department, and authorized agents of the Board shall
have immediate access to the Licensed Premises at all times and under all
circumstances.
3.  Underage Service. No alcoholic beverages shall be sold to anyone under the age of 21
years. It shall be a defense to any alleged claim of sale of alcohol to a minor if the
Licensee can show that the patron produced a valid Massachusetts driver’s license, a
valid Massachusetts Liquor Identification Card, a valid Passport issued by the United
States or by a government of a foreign country recognized by the United States
government, or a valid U.S. issued Military ID card or a valid U.S. Passport Card. 
Licensees may accept out of state licenses as proof of age but Licensees shall bear the
risk that such licenses are real and valid.
4.  Responsible Operations.  The Licensee shall ensure that all business within the
Licensed Premises, and within areas under the Licensee’s control that abut the Licensed
Premises, is conducted in a responsible manner so that no activity shall detract from the
quality of life in the City generally, or in the neighborhood in which the Licensed
Premises is located. This shall include, but not be limited to, ensuring that there shall be
no disorder, unlawful use or sale of drugs, indecency, prostitution, assaults, lewdness, or
gambling on or about the Licensed Premises.
5.  Sale to Intoxicated Persons.  No alcoholic beverages shall be sold or delivered to an
intoxicated person.
6.  Off-Premises Alcoholic Beverages Prohibited. No patron may remove any alcoholic
beverage from Chapter 138, Section 12 on-premises Licensed Premises, unless the
patron is taking off the premises of a restaurant or hotel a resealed bottle of partially
consumed wine as regulated by Chapter 138, Section 12 and the Rules and Regulations
of the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission.
7.  Entertainment. No Licensee shall provide or allow entertainment unless an
entertainment license has been obtained from the Board (or Mayor of Framingham, if
on a Sunday).

Page 10 of 21
Page 177
restriction on account of race, color, creed, sex, sexual/gender orientation or
designation, or ancestry relative to the admission or treatment of any person.
9.  Bottle Service.  “Bottle Service” (i.e., the sale and/or service of an entire bottle of hard
alcohol or spirits) shall be strictly prohibited unless expressly authorized in advance by
the Board. Any licensee authorized for Bottle Service shall have the term “Bottle
Service,” along with any relevant conditions included on the physical License
displayed at the Licensed Premises. The Board shall have the authority to deny or
condition an application for Bottle Service in its sole discretion.

XIV. Penalties, Procedure and Structure for Violations of the Ordinance and Regulations
A.  Purpose
The purpose of this penalty structure is to improve the ability of the Board to prevent alcohol
abuse and violation of the Laws. This Article XV will help to achieve reasonable uniformity in the
imposition of penalties and to avoid confusion in the minds of the public, patrons, and Licensees due to
a lack of understanding of the consequences of violating the Laws and License terms. This Article XV
is intended to empower the Board to consider the circumstances of each case and provide a mechanism
by which Licensees can improve their compliance with the Laws in the future.
B.  General Provisions
A.  No Illegality on Premises. No Licensee shall permit any illegality to occur on the
Licensed Premises, regardless of whether such illegality relates to the sale and service
of alcoholic beverages. The Manager of Record shall at all times maintain order and
decorum on the premises and in the immediately surrounding area of the premises and
shall cooperate with City officials in ensuring safe and orderly facilities.
B.  Reporting of Incidents. All violations of the Laws are to be reported to the Framingham
Page 14 of 21
Page 181
Police Department by the owner, Manager, Assistant Manager, or any employee of the
Licensee that becomes aware of an offense involving the Licensed Premises within
twenty-four hours of said violation unless the incident is serious enough to comprise
public safety and needs immediate attention at which time Framingham Police shall be
notified forthwith. Failure to report a violation involving the Licensed Premises
constitutes a violation of these Regulations and will subject the Licensee to appropriate
discipline in accordance with the procedure set forth herein.
C.  Penalties; Generally. Penalties for offenses shall be in line with the City’s general
goals of protecting public safety and the general welfare. Penalties will also be imposed
with the goal of preventing future offenses. A violation of these Regulations alone
(rather than state law or the Ordinances) may give rise to the issuance of penalties
pursuant to this Article to the extent permitted under law. The nature and severity of
the penalties imposed will be decided according to the nature of the offense and the
presence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances as further described herein. All
offenses by Licensees will result in the imposition of a penalty of some degree. This
will impress upon Licensees, managers, and servers their responsibility for ensuring
compliance with these Regulations, for prevention of offenses and for compliance with
the terms of licenses and the liquor laws of the Commonwealth.

any one or more of the following as appropriate: (a) Revocation of License; (b) 
Suspension of License; (c) Modification of License; (d) Imposition of New

Participation in Alcohol Abuse and Offense Prevention Programs; and/or (g) 
any other reasonable penalty, in the Board’s reasonable discretion.
b. Penalty Guidelines. The penalty guidelines stated in these Regulations are
intended to provide indication of the range of penalties the Board will impose if
a hearing is held on any offense. The Board will refer to these guidelines by
deciding whether to approve a negotiated recommended resolution.
D. Police Department Recommendation; Negotiation Procedure; Record Keeping. The
Police Department is authorized to negotiate with any authorized representative of the
Licensee the terms upon which the Police Department will recommend to the Board that an
offense be resolved. 
a. Any such negotiated recommended resolution must be in writing, signed by the
Manager of Record or designated representative of the Licensee charged with
the offense and approved by the Police Chief. The recommendation must
include a statement detailing the facts determined in the Police Department
investigation. The recommended resolution is not binding upon the City unless
and until approved by the Board.
b. If the Police Department and the Manager of Record and/or an authorized
representative of the Licensee cannot agree on a recommended resolution, the
Page 15 of 21
Page 182
Police Department will make any additional investigation it deems necessary
for a complete presentation of the facts and will file a written report with the
Board.
c. The Board may consider, but is not required to accept, a negotiated resolution
recommended by the Police Department. The Board is empowered to consider
alternative penalties consistent with this Article XV and the Laws.
d. The Police Department and the Board will maintain a public record of offenses
and their disposition that will be indexed according to the Licensee, Manager
or Assistant Manager, server and purchaser involved.
E. Notice to Licensee. Written notice shall be provided to a Licensee of an alleged
violation of the Laws. The notice provided to Licensee may contain the Police
Department's recommendation to the Board concerning the punishment for the alleged
violation. The notice will include the date of the event giving rise to the possible
disciplinary action, a description of the event, and a clear identification of the Laws that
are alleged to have been violated as a result of the event. Said notice will also provide
Licensee with the date upon which the Board will hold a hearing concerning the
Licensee's alleged violation. A notice containing the above-mentioned information shall
be sent to Licensee via certified mail return receipt requested no less than ten (10) days
prior to the date of the hearing before the Board. Licensees are entitled to retain counsel
to represent them at the hearing if they so desire.
F. Written Statement of Disciplinary Action. If the Board decides to take disciplinary
action against the Licensee for a violation of the Laws, the Board will provide the
Licensee with a statement of reasons why disciplinary action was taken against
Licensee. The above-mentioned statement of reasons will be included with the notice of
the Board’s disciplinary action.
C.  Determination of Penalties
Penalties will be determined according to the following procedure.
1.  The base level offense(s) will be determined from those offenses described in Article
XV, Section D.
2.  Adjustments according to the presence of factors that warrant an increase in the penalty
described in Article XV, Section E ("aggravating factors") or decrease described in

1.  Timeline Requirements for Filing a Change of Manager Application. An application for
Change of Manager of Record or Assistant Manager must be filed with the Board at least two (2) weeks
before the proposed effective date of the change (“Change of Management Notice Deadline”), unless the
Manager of Record has terminated his or her employment without prior notice to the Licensee or is
terminated by Licensee under circumstances which do not reasonably allow for advance Change of 
Management Deadline Notice (“Early Management Termination”). In the event of Early Management
Termination, the Licensee must, within thirty (30) days of such termination, notify the Board of: (a) the
basic facts surrounding such termination; (ii) the name of the person who will discharge the duties of
Manager pending selection and approval of a new Manager of Record; and
Page 5 of 21
Page 214
(iii) shall file the application for a Change of Manager no more than thirty (30) days after the departure of
the approved Manager of Record. If the Board finds that the circumstances justify the noncompliance with
the Change of Manager Notice Timeline, no penalty will be imposed so long as the Licensee complies with
subsections (i) through (iii) above. If the circumstances for the delay are not found to be sufficient, or if the
application for a Change of Manager is filed more than thirty (30) days after the departure of the Manager of
Record, the Board may impose a penalty or suspension of up to one (1) day of suspension for each day of 
unjustified non-compliance or for each day that passes beyond the passage of thirty (30) days after departure
of the Manager of Record before the application for a new manager is filed, or such other penalty permitted
by Article XIV herein. In addition to the foregoing, the Board shall also have the right to impose penalties
for the failure to provide timely notification of the departure of an Assistant Manager. When submitting an
application for change of Manager or Assistant Manager, the Manager or Assistant Manager shall be certified
as an alcohol server and registered with the Police Department prior to submitting the application. Further, 
approval of a change in Manager may be conditioned upon proof of payment of all outstanding local, state, 
and federal taxes and fees.
2.  Manager Background Checks. Upon receipt of an application for an original License, or, in
the case of a new Manager of Record or Assistant Manager, upon being advised of the new Manager of
Record or Assistant Manager’s identity, the Framingham Police Department will conduct a background
check of any proposed Licensee, Manager of Record or Assistant Manager, and such check will include a
review of any existing criminal record. The Board may reject any application where the Licensee’s, 
Manager of Record’s or Assistant Manager’s criminal record indicates, theft, unlawful drug offense(s) (with
the exception of any criminal arrest or conviction relating to possession of marijuana which predate the
enactment of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 94G), alcohol-related offenses, a propensity for violence,
or other behavior, that, in the opinion of the Board, might disqualify the individual from responsibly
carrying out their duties as Manager of Record or would otherwise put the public at risk.
3.  Violations. A violation of any of subsection 1 regarding change of Manager shall 
constitute a violation of these Regulations and shall subject the Licensee to possible discipline and/or
penalties in accordance with this section or with Article XIV herein.
V.  Responsibilities of Manager of Record:
1.  Authority & Control of Licensed Premises. The Board regards the Manager of Record of
Licensed Premises as the principal representative of the Licensee and as having full authority and control of
the Licensed Premises and of the conduct of all business therein relative to alcoholic beverages, all as
provided in the Laws. An Assistant Manager or other suitable managerial employee capable of fulfilling the
duties of Manager of Record must be listed on the License by the Licensee. This will allow for continuity of
the Manager position should either the Manager of Record or Assistant Manager positions become vacant
during the course of the year.
2.  Responsibilities. Without limiting the scope of the previous subsection, the Board will hold
the Manager of Record responsible for the following:
a. Careful selection of qualified employees of the licensed business, including servers,

Page 6 of 21
Page 215
b. Training of employees in all matters relating to the sale and service of alcoholic
beverages;
c. Assuring that employees serving alcohol to the public have successfully completed an
alcoholic beverage training program for serving alcohol responsibly and strongly
encourage continual training of employees engaged in serving and selling alcoholic
beverages;
d. Ensuring that no criminal activity, including the sale and distribution of narcotic
drugs, takes place on the Licensed Premises, including within any parking area 
ancillary to or serving the Licensed Premises;
e. Promptly reporting to the Police Department all instances of attempted purchases or
procurement of service of alcoholic beverages by minors, including attempts to gain
access to premises upon which alcoholic beverages are served and from which minors
are excluded, and appropriate action taken by the Licensee in response thereto. Such
appropriate action shall include (1) Reporting to the Registry of Motor Vehicles
instances involving possession or use of a false, forged, or counterfeit license to operate
motor vehicles or identification card issued by the Registry of Motor Vehicles; (2) 
confiscation of liquor identification cards or motor vehicle operator’s license presented
by the minor; and (3) if a purchase was made or service was procured, the name of the 
Licensee’s employee participating therein;
f. Enforcement of the Laws with respect to the operation of the licensed business;
g. Ensuring that the Licensed Premises, including the exterior, are kept clean, neat, and
sanitary at all times; and
h. The Board strongly encourages the Manager of Record and/or Assistant Manager to
attend the recommended Annual Alcohol Education Seminar. Failure to attend such
seminar shall not constitute a defense to any violation of the Laws.
3.  Hours on Licensed Premises. Except as provided herein, the Manager of Record must be
a full-time employee or a corporate officer of the Licensee, must be engaged exclusively in the
management of the licensed business, and must be a qualified seller or server of alcoholic beverages
registered with the Framingham Police Department. The Manager of Record shall not undertake any non-
managerial position(s) (i.e., bartender, server, cook) or any other role which interferes with the Manager of
Record’s oversight of the Licensed Premises. The Manager of Record must be on the Licensed Premises at
least forty (40) hours per week in the course of business, consistent with the permitted hours of operation.
When the Manager of Record is not upon the Licensed Premises, the person in charge of the business must
be an Assistant Manager or a qualified seller or server of alcoholic beverages registered with the
Framingham Police Department and designated by the approved Manager of Record to have charge of the
business in the Manager’s absence. The Manager of Record shall be responsible for the operation of the
business whether or not on the Licensed Premises. When the Manager of Record is not upon the Licensed
Premises, a method 
Page 7 of 21
Page 216
of contacting the Manager of Record promptly must be arranged so that the Manager of Record can be
reached at all times by the person designated to be in charge of the Licensed Premises. The provisions of
the first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to any Licensee holding a license issued under Chapter
138, Section 12 to a veterans’ organization or to a Licensee holding a license issued to a club under
Chapter 138, Section 17.
4.  Failure of the Manager of Record to comply with this policy or to properly discharge the
duties of manager may result in removal as Manager or suspension or revocation of the License as may be
appropriate to the circumstances.
VI. Procedure for Obtaining Liquor Licenses
The applicant for a License of any type should submit a letter to the Board outlining the proposal
with a completed application and include a request for a hearing with the Board. The applicant should
request to be placed on the agenda and publish a public notice of the date selected for the hearing in
accordance with Chapter 138. At a duly noticed public hearing, the Board will consider the application for a
License and the input of any interested members of the public. The Board will then consider the application
and respond in a timely manner to the applicant. The Board shall provide a copy of these Regulations to
each Licensee at the time when they pick up their annual license. The Licensee shall sign a receipt to be
maintained by the Board evidencing their receipt of a copy of these Regulations.
Pursuant to Chapter 138, Section 15A, where there are no premises actually in existence at the time
the application for a License is made, the applicant shall file a plan showing the actual dimensions of
premises which are to be constructed on which the License is to be exercised. A License granted under this
provision shall be upon the condition that such License shall not be issued until completion of the Licensed
Premises in accordance with the plan, and the decision of the Board as to whether the plan has been
complied with shall be final. The Board may include as a condition of such License that the Licensed
Premises be completed in accordance with the plan by a date certain or the License shall be deemed null and
void. Said specified completion date may be extended by the Board in its sole discretion upon written
request by the applicant submitted to the Board at least 45 days prior to the expiration of the initial
anticipated completion date as stated in the License.
VII. Considerations for Approval of New License or Transfer:
The Board will consider any or all of the following that can be reasonably offered in support of a
particular License application:
1. The applicant is a qualified Veterans’ organization and seeks a club license.
2. Subject to applicable zoning requirements, the applicant proposes an establishment that offers
a regular forum for music and musicians to play and obtain exposure for their work.
3. The applicant offers variety, or uniqueness, in its proposed establishment or shop, in
contrast to what exists in the City of Framingham at the time of the application.
4. The applicant demonstrates the elements for public need for the License particular location.
5. The applicant proposes an establishment that offers a substantial economic benefit to the City
of Framingham. 
Page 8 of 21
Page 217
6. Where the application pertains to a License to be issued pursuant to Chapter 138, Section 12, the
applicant offers, in addition to alcoholic beverages, a variety of non-alcoholic beverages (or
beverages containing only trace amounts of alcohol), such as mocktails, craft sodas, teas, 
kombucha, and non-alcoholic beer and wine, which are distinct from traditional non-alcoholic
beverages (water, soda, juice, etc.).
7. Proposals for off-premises retail establishments to be located in shopping malls or high-
density retail areas, either as new Licenses or transfers, are discouraged if the applicant’s
proposed License application duplicates or is similar to Licensed Premises presently located
in the area.
VIII. Modifications to Licensed Premises
Once a License is issued, no material physical changes to the Licensed Premises shall be made without the
prior approval of the Board. For the purpose of these Regulations, a material physical change shall be
considered a change in location or number of seats, location of bar, addition or reduction in square footage,
or any other change sufficient to require a building permit from the City of Framingham.
IX. Transfers of License
Licensees may request that their License be transferred to a third party. A $500 fee shall accompany each
application for ownership or transfer of location. Applications for transfer of ownership or location shall be
processed similarly to an original License application and the Board is not required to grant such transfer
requests. Approval of a transfer of majority ownership further may be conditioned upon the proof of
payment of all outstanding local, state, and federal taxes including, without limiting, the following: receipts
showing remittance to the proper taxing authorities of sales taxes, excise taxes and withheld federal and state
income taxes. Transfers of ownership to trustees in Bankruptcy, court- appointed receivers, or to assignees 
for the benefit of the creditors and those taking title or possession of the Licensed Premises by, through or
under them will not be deemed to transfer or convey any rights to the license or the renewal or transfer of
such license, unless provided by contrary superior law. Bona fide mortgagees in possession who are listed in
the application as holding such interest shall be treated in the same manner as the original majority
ownership license. A public hearing shall be required for any transfers of ownership or location, including, 
but not limited to transfers to mortgagees.
X.  Distribution of Regulations
These Regulations, in their most updated form, shall be provided to all Licensees upon issuance of
their License and, further, shall be regularly available at the City of Framingham Licensing Department and
online at the City of Framingham Board of License Commissioner’s webpage. These Regulations shall be
appended to each annual license issued by the Board. The Licensee may not pick up his/her annual license
until the Licensee has signed a receipt acknowledging that a copy of these Regulations has been received. A
copy of the most updated Regulations shall be maintained on the Licensed Premises at all times and shall be
available for inspection upon request.

3.  Underage Service. No alcoholic beverages shall be sold to anyone under the age of 21
years. It shall be a defense to any alleged claim of sale of alcohol to a minor if the Licensee

Massachusetts Liquor Identification Card, a valid Passport issued by the United States or
by a government of a foreign country recognized by the United States government, or a
valid U.S. issued Military ID card or a valid U.S. Passport Card. Licensees may accept out

shall include, but not be limited to, ensuring that there shall be no disorder, unlawful use or
sale of drugs, indecency, prostitution, assaults, lewdness, or gambling on or about the
Licensed Premises.

intoxicated person.

Beverages Control Commission.

XIV. Penalties, Procedure and Structure for Violations of the Ordinance and Regulations
A.  Purpose
The purpose of this penalty structure is to improve the ability of the Board to prevent alcohol abuse
and violation of the Laws. This Article XIV will help to achieve reasonable uniformity in the imposition of
penalties and to avoid confusion in the minds of the public, patrons, and Licensees due to a lack of
understanding of the consequences of violating the Laws and License terms. This Article XIV is intended to
empower the Board to consider the circumstances of each case and provide a mechanism by which
Licensees can improve their compliance with the Laws in the future.
B.  General Provisions
1. No Illegality on Premises. No Licensee shall permit any illegality to occur on the Licensed
Premises, regardless of whether such illegality relates to the sale and service of alcoholic
beverages. The Manager of Record shall at all times maintain order and decorum on the
premises and in the immediately surrounding area of the premises and shall cooperate with
City officials in ensuring safe and orderly facilities.
2. Reporting of Incidents. All violations of the Laws are to be reported to the Framingham
Page 14 of 21
Page 223
Police Department by the owner, Manager, Assistant Manager, or any employee of the Licensee
that becomes aware of an offense involving the Licensed Premises within twenty-four hours of
said violation unless the incident is serious enough to comprise public safety and needs
immediate attention at which time Framingham Police shall be notified forthwith. Failure to
report a violation involving the Licensed Premises constitutes a violation of these Regulations
and will subject the Licensee to appropriate discipline in accordance with the procedure set
forth herein.
3. Penalties; Generally. Penalties for offenses shall be in line with the City’s general goals of
protecting public safety and the general welfare. Penalties will also be imposed with the goal of
preventing future offenses. A violation of these Regulations alone (rather than state law or the
Ordinances) may give rise to the issuance of penalties pursuant to this Article to the extent
permitted under law. The nature and severity of the penalties imposed will be decided
according to the nature of the offense and the presence of mitigating or aggravating
circumstances as further described herein. All offenses by Licensees will result in the
imposition of a penalty of some degree. This will impress upon Licensees, managers, and
servers their responsibility for ensuring compliance with these Regulations, for prevention of
offenses and for compliance with the terms of licenses and the liquor laws of the
Commonwealth.
a. Types/Categories of License Penalties. Penalties by the Board may consist of any
one or more of the following as appropriate: (a) Revocation of License; (b) 
Suspension of License; (c) Modification of License; (d) Imposition of New 
Conditions on the License; (e) Imposition of Monetary Fines; (f) Mandatory 
Participation in Alcohol Abuse and Offense Prevention Programs; and/or (g) any
other reasonable penalty, in the Board’s reasonable discretion.
b. Penalty Guidelines. The penalty guidelines stated in these Regulations are intended
to provide indication of the range of penalties the Board will impose if a hearing is
held on any offense. The Board will refer to these guidelines by deciding whether to
approve a negotiated recommended resolution.
4. Police Department Recommendation; Negotiation Procedure; Record Keeping. The Police
Department is authorized to negotiate with any authorized representative of the Licensee the
terms upon which the Police Department will recommend to the Board that an offense be
resolved. 
a. Any such negotiated recommended resolution must be in writing, signed by the
Manager of Record or designated representative of the Licensee charged with the
offense and approved by the Police Chief. The recommendation must include a
statement detailing the facts determined in the Police Department investigation. The
recommended resolution is not binding upon the City unless and until approved by the
Board.
b. If the Police Department and the Manager of Record and/or an authorized
representative of the Licensee cannot agree on a recommended resolution, the
Page 15 of 21
Page 224
c. Police Department will make any additional investigation it deems necessary for a
complete presentation of the facts and will file a written report with the Board.
d. The Board may consider, but is not required to accept, a negotiated resolution
recommended by the Police Department. The Board is empowered to consider
alternative penalties consistent with this Article XIV and the Laws.
e. The Police Department and the Board will maintain a public record of offenses and
their disposition that will be indexed according to the Licensee, Manager or Assistant
Manager, server and purchaser involved.
5. Notice to Licensee. Written notice shall be provided to a Licensee of an alleged violation of the
Laws. The notice provided to Licensee may contain the Police Department's recommendation to
the Board concerning the punishment for the alleged violation. The notice will include the date of
the event giving rise to the possible disciplinary action, a description of the event, and a clear
identification of the Laws that are alleged to have been violated as a result of the event. Said
notice will also provide Licensee with the date upon which the Board will hold a hearing
concerning the Licensee's  alleged violation. A notice containing the above-mentioned
information shall be sent to Licensee via certified mail return receipt requested no less than ten
(10) days prior to the date of the hearing before the Board. Licensees are entitled to retain
counsel to represent them at the hearing if they so desire.

By virtue of the authority contained in Chapter 138 of the Massachusetts General Laws
(“Chapter 138”), and Article V, Section 1 of the City of Framingham General Ordinances (the
“Ordinances”), the Board of License Commissioners of the City of Framingham, serving as the City’s
Liquor Licensing Authority (the “Board”) hereby promulgates these Rules and Regulations Governing
Alcoholic Beverages (“Regulations”). The Regulations shall supersede all previous regulations or
policies issued by the City of Framingham (the “City”), or, collectively as the preceding licensing
authority, the Town of Framingham and/or Board of Selectmen. The Board has the power under the
Ordinances and the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to amend these Regulations
periodically from time to time as it sees fit. For the purposes hereof, the Regulations, Ordinances, and
Chapter 138 shall be collectively referred to as the “Laws”.
Any license issued for the sale in any manner of any alcoholic beverages (a “License”) shall be
issued on the condition of full compliance with these Regulations. The failure to comply with the Laws
and other Ordinances or rules issued by the City and/or the Board shall constitute sufficient cause or
grounds for refusing to grant the license, or for suspending, canceling, modifying, or revoking such
license or permit already granted, in accordance with Article XV herein. Any individual, organization, 
or company licensed by the Board pursuant to the Laws shall be referred to herein as a “Licensee”.
Any premises licensed by the Board pursuant to the Laws shall be referred to as the “Licensed
Premises”.
I.  Consumption of Alcoholic Beverages
Public consumption of alcoholic beverages as defined in Chapter 138, Section 1 is permitted
only in accordance with an appropriate License issued by the Board. Absent an appropriate License
issued by the Board, it is prohibited to drink any alcoholic beverage while on, in or upon any public
way or upon any way to which the public has a right of access; any place to which members of the
public have access as invitees or licensees; a park or playground. It is prohibited to drink any alcoholic
beverage while on, in or upon or private land or place without consent of the owner or person in control
thereof. All alcoholic beverages used in violation of this shall be seized and safely held until final
adjudication of the charge against the person or persons arrested or summoned before the court, at
which time they shall be returned to the person entitled to lawful possession.

least two (2) weeks before the proposed effective date of the change (“Change of Management Notice
Deadline”), unless the Manager of Record has terminated his or her employment without prior notice to
the Licensee or is terminated by Licensee under circumstances which do not reasonably allow for

Page 5 of 21
Page 254
(iii) shall file the application for a Change of Manager no more than thirty (30) days after the departure
of the approved Manager of Record. If the Board finds that the circumstances justify the noncompliance
with the Change of Manager Notice Timeline, no penalty will be imposed so long as the Licensee
complies with subsections (i) through (iii) above. If the circumstances for the delay are not found to be
sufficient, or if the application for a Change of Manager is filed more than thirty (30) days after the
departure of the Manager of Record, the Board may impose a penalty or suspension of up to one (1) day
of suspension for each day of unjustified non-compliance or for each day that passes beyond the

background check of any proposed Licensee, Manager of Record or Assistant Manager, and such check
will include a review of any existing criminal record. The Board may reject any application where the
Licensee’s, Manager of Record’s or Assistant Manager’s criminal record indicates, theft, unlawful drug
offense(s) (with the exception of any criminal arrest or conviction relating to possession of marijuana
which predate the enactment of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 94G), alcohol-related offenses, a
propensity for violence, or other behavior, that, in the opinion of the Board, might disqualify the
individual from responsibly carrying out their duties as Manager of Record or would otherwise put the
public at risk.
3.  Violations. A violation of any of subsection 1 regarding change of Manager shall
constitute a violation of these Regulations and shall subject the Licensee to possible discipline and/or
penalties in accordance with this section or with Article XV herein.
V.  Responsibilities of Manager of Record:
1.  Authority & Control of Licensed Premises.  The Board regards the Manager of
Record of Licensed Premises as the principal representative of the Licensee and as having full authority
and control of the Licensed Premises and of the conduct of all business therein relative to alcoholic
beverages, all as provided in the Laws. An Assistant Manager or other suitable managerial employee
capable of fulfilling the duties of Manager of Record must be listed on the License by the Licensee.

ancillary to or serving the Licensed Premises;
e. Promptly reporting to the Police Department all instances of attempted purchases
or procurement of service of alcoholic beverages by minors, including attempts to
gain access to premises upon which alcoholic beverages are served and from which
minors are excluded, and appropriate action taken by the Licensee in response
thereto. Such appropriate action shall include (1) Reporting to the Registry of
Motor Vehicles instances involving possession or use of a false, forged, or
counterfeit license to operate motor vehicles or identification card issued by the
Registry of Motor Vehicles; (2) confiscation of liquor identification cards or motor
vehicle operator’s license presented by the minor; and (3) if a purchase was made
or service was procured, the name of the Licensee’s employee participating

and sanitary at all times; and

the management of the licensed business, and must be a qualified seller or server of alcoholic
beverages registered with the Framingham Police Department. The Manager of Record shall not
undertake any non-managerial position(s) (i.e., bartender, server, cook) or any other role which
interferes with the Manager of Record’s oversight of the Licensed Premises. The Manager of Record
must be on the Licensed Premises at least forty (40) hours per week in the course of business,
consistent with the permitted hours of operation. When the Manager of Record is not upon the
Licensed Premises, the person in charge of the business must be an Assistant Manager or a qualified

designated by the approved Manager of Record to have charge of the business in the Manager’s
absence. The Manager of Record shall be responsible for the operation of the business whether or not

Page 7 of 21
Page 256
of contacting the Manager of Record promptly must be arranged so that the Manager of Record can
be reached at all times by the person designated to be in charge of the Licensed Premises. The
provisions of the first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to any Licensee holding a license
issued under Chapter 138, Section 12 to a veterans’ organization or to a Licensee holding a license
issued to a club under Chapter 138, Section 17.
4.  Failure of the Manager of Record to comply with this policy or to properly discharge
the duties of manager may result in removal as Manager or suspension or revocation of the License as
may be appropriate to the circumstances.
VI. Procedure for Obtaining Liquor Licenses
The applicant for a License of any type should submit a letter to the Board outlining the
proposal with a completed application and include a request for a hearing with the Board. The applicant
should request to be placed on the agenda and publish a public notice of the date selected for the
hearing in accordance with Chapter 138. At a duly noticed public hearing, the Board will consider the
application for a License and the input of any interested members of the public. The Board will then
consider the application and respond in a timely manner to the applicant. The Board shall provide a
copy of these Regulations to each Licensee at the time when they pick up their annual license. The
Licensee shall sign a receipt to be maintained by the Board evidencing their receipt of a copy of these
Regulations.
Pursuant to Chapter 138, Section 15A, where there are no premises actually in existence at the
time the application for a License is made, the applicant shall file a plan showing the actual dimensions
of premises which are to be constructed on which the License is to be exercised. A License granted
under this provision shall be upon the condition that such License shall not be issued until completion
of the Licensed Premises in accordance with the plan, and the decision of the Board as to whether the
plan has been complied with shall be final. The Board may include as a condition of such License that
the Licensed Premises be completed in accordance with the plan by a date certain or the License shall
be deemed null and void. Said specified completion date may be extended by the Board in its sole
discretion upon written request by the applicant submitted to the Board at least 45 days prior to the
expiration of the initial anticipated completion date as stated in the License.
VII. Considerations for Approval of New License or Transfer:
The Board will consider any or all of the following that can be reasonably offered in support of a
particular License application:
1. The applicant is a qualified Veterans’ organization and seeks a club license.
2. Subject to applicable zoning requirements, the applicant proposes an establishment that
offers a regular forum for music and musicians to play and obtain exposure for their work.
3. The applicant offers variety, or uniqueness, in its proposed establishment or shop, in
contrast to what exists in the City of Framingham at the time of the application.
4. The applicant demonstrates the elements for public need for the License particular location.
5. The applicant proposes an establishment that offers a substantial economic benefit to the
City of Framingham. 
Page 8 of 21
Page 257
6. Where the application pertains to a License to be issued pursuant to Chapter 138, Section
12, the applicant offers, in addition to alcoholic beverages, a variety of non-alcoholic
beverages (or beverages containing only trace amounts of alcohol), such as mocktails, craft
sodas, teas, kombucha, and non-alcoholic beer and wine, which are distinct from traditional
non-alcoholic beverages (water, soda, juice, etc.).
7. Proposals for off-premises retail establishments to be located in shopping malls or
high-density retail areas, either as new Licenses or transfers, are discouraged if the
applicant’s proposed License application duplicates or is similar to Licensed Premises
presently located in the area.
VIII. Modifications to Licensed Premises
Once a License is issued, no material physical changes to the Licensed Premises shall be made without
the prior approval of the Board. For the purpose of these Regulations, a material physical change shall
be considered a change in location or number of seats, location of bar, addition or reduction in square
footage, or any other change sufficient to require a building permit from the City of Framingham.
IX. Transfers of License
Licensees may request that their License be transferred to a third party. A $500 fee shall accompany
each application for ownership or transfer of location. Applications for transfer of ownership or location
shall be processed similarly to an original License application and the Board is not required to grant
such transfer requests. Approval of a transfer of majority ownership further may be conditioned upon
the proof of payment of all outstanding local, state, and federal taxes including, without limiting, the
following: receipts showing remittance to the proper taxing authorities of sales taxes, excise taxes and
withheld federal and state income taxes. Transfers of ownership to trustees in Bankruptcy, court-
appointed receivers, or to assignees for the benefit of the creditors and those taking title or possession
of the Licensed Premises by, through or under them will not be deemed to transfer or convey any rights
to the license or the renewal or transfer of such license, unless provided by contrary superior law. Bona
fide mortgagees in possession who are listed in the application as holding such interest shall be treated
in the same manner as the original majority ownership license. A public hearing shall be required for
any transfers of ownership or location, including, but not limited to transfers to mortgagees.
X.  Distribution of Regulations
These Regulations, in their most updated form, shall be provided to all Licensees upon issuance
of their License and, further, shall be regularly available at the City of Framingham Licensing
Department and online at the City of Framingham Board of License Commissioner’s webpage. These
Regulations shall be appended to each annual license issued by the Board. The Licensee may not pick
up his/her annual license until the Licensee has signed a receipt acknowledging that a copy of these
Regulations has been received. A copy of the most updated Regulations shall be maintained on the
Licensed Premises at all times and shall be available for inspection upon request.

States or by a government of a foreign country recognized by the United States

XIV. Penalties, Procedure and Structure for Violations of the Ordinance and Regulations
A.  Purpose
The purpose of this penalty structure is to improve the ability of the Board to prevent alcohol
abuse and violation of the Laws. This Article XV will help to achieve reasonable uniformity in the
imposition of penalties and to avoid confusion in the minds of the public, patrons, and Licensees due to
a lack of understanding of the consequences of violating the Laws and License terms. This Article XV
is intended to empower the Board to consider the circumstances of each case and provide a mechanism
by which Licensees can improve their compliance with the Laws in the future.
B.  General Provisions
A.  No Illegality on Premises. No Licensee shall permit any illegality to occur on the
Licensed Premises, regardless of whether such illegality relates to the sale and service
of alcoholic beverages. The Manager of Record shall at all times maintain order and
decorum on the premises and in the immediately surrounding area of the premises and
shall cooperate with City officials in ensuring safe and orderly facilities.
B.  Reporting of Incidents. All violations of the Laws are to be reported to the Framingham

Licensee that becomes aware of an offense involving the Licensed Premises within
twenty-four hours of said violation unless the incident is serious enough to comprise
public safety and needs immediate attention at which time Framingham Police shall be
notified forthwith. Failure to report a violation involving the Licensed Premises
constitutes a violation of these Regulations and will subject the Licensee to appropriate
discipline in accordance with the procedure set forth herein.
C.  Penalties; Generally. Penalties for offenses shall be in line with the City’s general
goals of protecting public safety and the general welfare. Penalties will also be imposed
with the goal of preventing future offenses. A violation of these Regulations alone
(rather than state law or the Ordinances) may give rise to the issuance of penalties
pursuant to this Article to the extent permitted under law. The nature and severity of
the penalties imposed will be decided according to the nature of the offense and the
presence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances as further described herein. All
offenses by Licensees will result in the imposition of a penalty of some degree. This
will impress upon Licensees, managers, and servers their responsibility for ensuring
compliance with these Regulations, for prevention of offenses and for compliance with
the terms of licenses and the liquor laws of the Commonwealth.

any one or more of the following as appropriate: (a) Revocation of License; (b) 
Suspension of License; (c) Modification of License; (d) Imposition of New

Participation in Alcohol Abuse and Offense Prevention Programs; and/or (g) 
any other reasonable penalty, in the Board’s reasonable discretion.

intended to provide indication of the range of penalties the Board will impose if
a hearing is held on any offense. The Board will refer to these guidelines by
deciding whether to approve a negotiated recommended resolution.
D. Police Department Recommendation; Negotiation Procedure; Record Keeping. The
Police Department is authorized to negotiate with any authorized representative of the
Licensee the terms upon which the Police Department will recommend to the Board that an
offense be resolved. 
a. Any such negotiated recommended resolution must be in writing, signed by the
Manager of Record or designated representative of the Licensee charged with
the offense and approved by the Police Chief. The recommendation must
include a statement detailing the facts determined in the Police Department
investigation. The recommended resolution is not binding upon the City unless
and until approved by the Board.
b. If the Police Department and the Manager of Record and/or an authorized
representative of the Licensee cannot agree on a recommended resolution, the
Page 15 of 21
Page 264
Police Department will make any additional investigation it deems necessary
for a complete presentation of the facts and will file a written report with the
Board.
c. The Board may consider, but is not required to accept, a negotiated resolution
recommended by the Police Department. The Board is empowered to consider
alternative penalties consistent with this Article XV and the Laws.
d. The Police Department and the Board will maintain a public record of offenses
and their disposition that will be indexed according to the Licensee, Manager
or Assistant Manager, server and purchaser involved.
E. Notice to Licensee. Written notice shall be provided to a Licensee of an alleged
violation of the Laws. The notice provided to Licensee may contain the Police
Department's recommendation to the Board concerning the punishment for the alleged
violation. The notice will include the date of the event giving rise to the possible
disciplinary action, a description of the event, and a clear identification of the Laws that
are alleged to have been violated as a result of the event. Said notice will also provide
Licensee with the date upon which the Board will hold a hearing concerning the
Licensee's alleged violation. A notice containing the above-mentioned information shall
be sent to Licensee via certified mail return receipt requested no less than ten (10) days
prior to the date of the hearing before the Board. Licensees are entitled to retain counsel
to represent them at the hearing if they so desire.
F. Written Statement of Disciplinary Action. If the Board decides to take disciplinary
action against the Licensee for a violation of the Laws, the Board will provide the
Licensee with a statement of reasons why disciplinary action was taken against
Licensee. The above-mentioned statement of reasons will be included with the notice of
the Board’s disciplinary action.
C.  Determination of Penalties
Penalties will be determined according to the following procedure.
1.  The base level offense(s) will be determined from those offenses described in Article
XV, Section D.
2.  Adjustments according to the presence of factors that warrant an increase in the penalty
described in Article XV, Section E ("aggravating factors") or decrease described in
Article XV, Section F (“mitigating factors") will be considered.
3.  Adjustments according to the number of violations involved in the particular offense will
be considered.

considered. The Board is entitled to consider fines or suspensions issued by the

Any license issued for the sale in any manner of any alcoholic beverages (a “License”) shall be

Licensees can improve their compliance with the Laws in the future.
