Page 5 of 22 
Page 208
application for Change of Manager of Record or Assistant Manager must be filed with the Board at
least two (2) weeks before the proposed effective date of the change (“Change of Management Notice
Deadline”), unless the Manager of Record has terminated his or her employment without prior notice to
the Licensee or is terminated by Licensee under circumstances which do not reasonably allow for
advance Change of Management Deadline Notice (“Early Management Termination”). In the event
of Early Management Termination, the Licensee must, within thirty (30) days of such termination, 
notify the Board of: (a) the basic facts surrounding such termination; (ii) the name of the person who
will discharge the duties of Manager pending selection and approval of a new Manager of Record; and
(iii) shall file the application for a Change of Manager no more than thirty (30) days after the departure
of the approved Manager of Record. If the Board finds that the circumstances justify the noncompliance
with the Change of Manager Notice Timeline, no penalty will be imposed so long as the Licensee
complies with subsections (i) through (iii) above. If the circumstances for the delay are not found to be
sufficient, or if the application for a Change of Manager is filed more than thirty (30) days after the
departure of the Manager of Record, the Board may impose a penalty or suspension of up to one (1) day
of suspension for each day of unjustified non-compliance or for each day that passes beyond the
passage of thirty (30) days after departure of the Manager of Record before the application for a new
manager is filed, or such other penalty permitted by Article XV herein. In addition to the foregoing, the
Board shall also have the right to impose penalties for the failure to provide timely notification of the
departure of an assistant manager. When submitting an application for change of Manager or Assistant
Manager, the Manager or Assistant Manager shall be certified as an alcohol server and registered with
the Police Department prior to submitting the application. Further, approval of a change in Manager
may be conditioned upon proof of payment of all outstanding local, state, and federal taxes and fees. 
2.  Manager Background Checks. Upon receipt of an application for an original License, 
or, in the case of a new Manager of Record or Assistant Manager, upon being advised of the new
Manager of Record or assistant manager’s identity, the Framingham Police Department will conduct a
background check of any proposed Licensee, Manager of Record or Assistant Manager, and such check
will include a review of any existing criminal record. The Board may reject any application where the
Licensee’s, Manager of Record’s or Assistant Manager’s criminal record indicates, theft, unlawful drug
offense(s) (with the exception of any criminal arrest or conviction relating to possession of marijuana
which predate the enactment of Massachusetts General Laws Chapter 94G), alcohol-related offenses, a
propensity for violence, or other behavior, that, in the opinion of the Board, might disqualify the
individual from responsibly carrying out their duties as Manager of Record or would otherwise put the
public at risk. 
3.  Violations. A violation of any of subsection 1 regarding change of Manager shall
constitute a violation of these Regulations and shall subject the Licensee to possible discipline and/or
penalties in accordance with this section or with Article XV herein. 
V.  Responsibilities of Manager of Record: 
1.  Authority & Control of License Premises. The Board regards the Manager of Record
of Licensed Premises as the principal representative of the Licensee and as having full authority and
control of the Licensed Premises and of the conduct of all business therein relative to alcoholic
beverages, all as provided in Chapter 138, Section 26, and these Regulations. An Assistant Manager or
other suitable managerial employee capable of fulfilling the duties of Manager of Record must be listed
Page 6 of 22 
Page 209
on the License by the Licensee. This will allow for continuity of the Manager position should either the
Manager of Record or Assistant Manager positions become vacant during the course of the year. 
2.  Responsibilities. Without limiting the scope of the previous subsection, the Board will
hold the Manager of Record responsible for the following: 
a. Careful selection of qualified employees of the licensed business, including servers, 
clerks and persons who are engaged with the public in any capacity; 
b. Training of employees in all matters relating to the sale and service of alcoholic
beverages; 
c. Assuring that employees serving alcohol to the public have successfully completed
an alcoholic beverage training program for serving alcohol responsibly and
providing for continual training of employees engaged in serving and selling
alcoholic beverages; 
d. Ensuring that no criminal activity, including the sale and distribution of narcotic
drugs, takes place on the Licensed Premises, including within any parking area
ancillary to or serving the Licensed Premises; 
e. Promptly reporting to the Police Department all instances of attempted purchases
or procurement of service of alcoholic beverages by minors, including attempts to
gain access to premises upon which alcoholic beverages are served and from which
minors are excluded, and appropriate action taken by the Licensee in response
thereto. Such appropriate action shall include (1) Reporting to the Registry of
Motor Vehicles instances involving possession or use of a false, forged, or
counterfeit license to operate motor vehicles or identification card issued by the
Registry of Motor Vehicles; (2) confiscation of liquor identification cards or motor
vehicle operator’s license presented by the minor; and (3) if a purchase was made
or service was procured, the name of the Licensee’s employee participating
therein; 
f. Enforcement of state law, the Ordinances, and these Regulations with respect to the
operation of the licensed business; 
g. Ensuring that the Licenses Premises, including the exterior, are kept clean, neat, 
and sanitary at all times; and
h. The Board strongly encourages the Manager of Record and/or Assistant Manager
to attend the recommended Annual Alcohol Education Seminar. Failure to attend
such seminar shall not constitute a defense to any violation of Chapter 138, other
state laws, the Ordinance, and these Regulations. 
3.  Hours on Licensed Premises.  Except as provided herein, the Manager of Record
must be a full-time employee or a corporate officer of the Licensee, must be engaged exclusively in
Page 7 of 22 
Page 210
the management of the licensed business, and must be a qualified seller or server of alcoholic
beverages registered with the Framingham Police Department. The Manager of Record shall not
undertake any non-managerial position(s) (i.e., bartender, server, cook) or any other role which
interferes with the Manager of Record’s oversight of the Licensed Premises. The Manager of Record
must be on the Licensed Premises at least forty (40) hours per week in the course of business, 
consistent with the permitted hours of operation. When the Manager of Record is not upon the
Licensed Premises, the person actually in charge of the business must be an Assistant Manager or a
qualified seller or server of alcoholic beverages registered with the Framingham Police Department
and designated by the approved Manager of Record to have charge of the business in the Manager’s
absence. The Manager of Record shall be responsible for the operation of the business whether or not
on the Licensed Premises. When the Manager of Record is not upon the Licensed Premises, a method
of contacting the Manager of Record promptly must be arranged so that the Manager of Record can
be reached at all times by the person designated to be actually in charge of the Licensed Premises. 
The provisions of the first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to any Licensee holding a
license issued under Chapter 138, Section 12 to a veterans’ organization or to a Licensee holding a
license issued to a club under Chapter 138, Section 17. 
4.  Failure of the Manager of Record to comply with this policy or to properly discharge
the duties of manager may result in removal as manager or suspension or revocation of the License as
may be appropriate to the circumstances. 
VI. Procedure for Obtaining Liquor Licenses
The applicant for a License of any type should submit a letter to the Board outlining the
proposal and include a request for a hearing with the Board. The applicant should request to be placed
on the agenda and publish a public notice of the date selected for the hearing in accordance with
Chapter 138. At a duly noticed public hearing, the Board will consider the application for a License and
the input of any interested members of the public. The Board will then consider the application and
respond in a timely manner to the applicant. The Board shall provide a copy of these Regulations to
each Licensee at the time when they pick up their annual license. The Licensee shall sign a receipt to be
maintained by the Board evidencing their receipt of a copy of these Regulations. 
Pursuant to Chapter 138, Section 15A, where there are no premises actually in existence at the
time the application for a License is made, the applicant shall file a plan showing the actual dimensions
of premises which are to be constructed on which the License is to be exercised. A License granted
under this provision shall be upon the condition that such License shall not issue until completion of the
Licensed Premises in accordance with the plan, and the decision of the Board as to whether the plan has
been complied with shall be final. The Board may include as a condition of such License that the
Licensed Premises be completed in accordance with the plan by a date certain or the License shall be
deemed null and void. Said specified completion date may be extended by the Board in its sole
discretion upon written request by the applicant submitted to the Board at least 45 days prior to the
expiration of the initial anticipated completion date as stated in the License. 
VII. Considerations for Approval of New License or Transfer: 
The Board will consider any or all of the following that can be reasonably offered in support of a
Page 8 of 22 
Page 211
particular License application: 
1. The applicant is a qualified Veterans’ organization and seeks a club license. [Comment: I’m
capitalizing “Veteran” in accordance with DoD style. This is purely a stylistic choice.]
2. Subject to applicable zoning requirements, the applicant proposes an establishment that
offers a regular forum for music and musicians to play and obtain exposure for their work. 
3. The applicant offers variety, or uniqueness, in its proposed establishment or shop, in
contrast to what exists in the City of Framingham at the time of the application. 
4. The applicant demonstrates the elements for public need for the License particular location. 
5. The applicant proposes an establishment that offers a substantial economic benefit to the
City of Framingham. 
6. Where the application pertains to a License to be issued pursuant to Chapter 138, Section
12, the applicant offers in addition to alcoholic beverages, a variety of non-alcoholic
beverages (or beverages containing only trace amounts of alcohol), such as mocktails, craft
sodas, teas, kombucha, and non-alcoholic beer and wine, which are distinct from traditional
non-alcoholic beverages (water, soda, juice, etc.)
7. Proposals for off-premises retail establishments to be located in shopping malls or
high-density retail areas, either as new Licenses or transfers, are discouraged if the
applicant’s proposed License application duplicates or is similar to Licensed Premises
presently located in the area. 
VIII. Modifications to Licensed Premises
Once a License is issued, no material physical changes to the Licensed Premises shall be made without
the prior approval of the Board. For the purpose of these Regulations, a material physical change shall
be considered a change in location or number seating, location of bar, addition or reduction in square
footage, or any other change sufficient to require a building permit from the City of Framingham. 
IX. Transfers of License
Licensees may request that their License be transferred to a third party. A $500 fee shall accompany
each application for ownership or transfer of location. Applications for transfer of ownership or location
shall be processed similarly to an original License application and the Board is not required to grant
such transfer requests. Approval of a transfer of majority ownership further may be conditioned upon
the proof of payment of all outstanding local, state, and federal taxes including, without limiting, the
following: receipts showing remittance to the proper taxing authorities of sales taxes, excise taxes and
withheld federal and state income taxes. Transfers of ownership to trustees in Bankruptcy, court-
appointed receivers, or to assignees for the benefit of the creditors and those taking title or possession
of the Licensed Premises by, through or under them will not be deemed to transfer or convey any rights
to the license or the renewal or transfer of such license, unless provided by contrary superior law. Bona
fide mortgagees in possession who are listed in the application as holding such interest shall be treated
in the same manner as the original majority ownership license. A public hearing shall be required for
any transfers of ownership or location, including, but not limited to transfers to mortgagees.

X.  Distribution of Regulations
These Regulations, in their most updated form, shall be provided to all Licensees upon issuance
of their License and, further, shall be regularly available at the City of Framingham Licensing
Department and online at the City of Framingham Board of License Commissioner’s webpage. These
Regulations shall be appended to each annual license issued by the Board. The Licensee may not pick
up his/her annual license until the Licensee has signed a receipt acknowledging that a copy of these
Regulations has been received. A copy of the most updated Regulations shall be maintained on the
Licensed Premises at all times and shall be available for inspection upon request.

States or by a government of a foreign country recognized by the United States

XV. Penalties, Procedure and Structure for Violations of the Ordinance and Regulations
A.  Purpose
The purpose of this penalty structure is to improve the ability of the Board to prevent alcohol
abuse and violation of the Laws and the requirements of these Regulations. This Article XV will help to
achieve reasonable uniformity in the imposition of penalties and to avoid confusion in the minds of the
public, patrons, and Licensees due to a lack of understanding of the consequences of violating the Laws
and License terms. This Article XV is intended to empower the Board to consider the circumstances of
each case and provide a mechanism by which Licensees can improve their compliance with these
Regulations in the future. 
B.  General Provisions
1.  No Illegality on Premises. No Licensee shall permit any illegality to occur on the
Licensed Premises, regardless of whether such illegality relates to the sale and service
of alcoholic beverages. The Manager of Record shall at all times maintain order and
decorum on the premises and in the immediately surrounding area of the premises and
shall cooperate with City officials in ensuring safe and orderly facilities. 
2.  Reporting of Incidents. All violations of the Laws are to be reported to the Framingham
Police Department by the owner, Manager, Assistant Manager, or any employee of the
Page 15 of 22 
Page 218
Licensee that becomes aware of an offense involving the Licensed Premises within
twenty-four hours of said violation unless the incident is serious enough to comprise
public safety and needs immediate attention at which time Framingham Police shall be
notified forthwith. Failure to report a violation involving the Licensed Premises
constitutes a violation of these Regulations and will subject the Licensee to appropriate
discipline in accordance with the procedure set forth herein. 
3.  Penalties; Generally. Penalties for offenses shall be in line with the City’s general
goals of protecting public safety and the general welfare. Penalties will also be imposed
with the goal of preventing future offenses. A violation of these Regulations alone
(rather than state law or the Ordinances) may give rise to the issuance of penalties
pursuant to this Article to the extent permitted under law. The nature and severity of
the penalties imposed will be decided according to the nature of the offense and the
presence of mitigating or aggravating circumstances as further described herein. All
offenses by Licensees will result in the imposition of a penalty of some degree. This
will impress upon Licensees, managers, and servers their responsibility for ensuring
compliance with these Regulations, for prevention of offenses and for compliance with
the terms of licenses and the liquor laws of the Commonwealth.

any one or more of the following as appropriate: (a) Revocation of License; (b) 
Suspension of License; (c) Modification of License; (d) Imposition of New

Participation in Alcohol Abuse and Offense Prevention Programs; and/or (g) 
any other reasonable penalty, in the Board’s reasonable discretion.

deciding whether to approve a negotiated recommended resolution.

Police Department is authorized to negotiate with any authorized representative of the
Licensee the terms upon which the Police Department will recommend to the Board that an
offense be resolved. 
a. Any such negotiated recommended resolution must be in writing, signed by the
Manager of Record or designated representative of the Licensee charged with
the offense and approved by the Police Chief. The recommendation must
include a statement detailing the facts determined in the Police Department
investigation. The recommended resolution is not binding upon the City unless
and until approved by the Board. 
b. If the Police Department and the Manager of Record and/or an authorized
representative of the Licensee cannot agree on a recommended resolution, the
Police Department will make any additional investigation it deems necessary

or Assistant Manager, server and purchaser involved. 
5. Notice to Licensee. Written notice shall be provided to a Licensee of an alleged
violation of Chapter 138, the Ordinance, and these Regulations. The notice provided to
Licensee may contain the Police Department's recommendation to the Board concerning
the punishment for the alleged violation. The notice will include the date of the event
giving rise to the possible disciplinary action, a description of the event, and a clear
identification of the statute(s), Ordinances or Regulations that are alleged to have been
violated as a result of the event. Said notice will also provide Licensee with the date
upon which the Board will hold a hearing concerning the Licensee's alleged violation. A
notice containing the above-mentioned information shall be sent to Licensee via
certified mail return receipt requested no less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the
hearing before the Board. Licensees are entitled to retain counsel to represent them at
the hearing if they so desire. 
6. Written Statement of Disciplinary Action. If the Board decides to take disciplinary
action against the Licensee for a violation of the Laws, the Board will provide the
Licensee with a statement of reasons why disciplinary action was taken against
Licensee. The above-mentioned statement of reasons will be included with the notice of
the Board’s disciplinary action. 
C.  Determination of Penalties
Penalties will be determined according to the following procedure. 
1.  The base level offense(s) will be determined from those offenses described in Article
XV, Section D. 
2.  Adjustments according to the presence of factors that warrant an increase in the penalty
described in Article XV, Section E ("aggravating factors")or decrease described in
