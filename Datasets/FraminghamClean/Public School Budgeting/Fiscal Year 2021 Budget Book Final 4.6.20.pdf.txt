Dear Framingham Community: 
In a world of uncertainty and worry, I hope you will find comfort in knowing that even
during a time of crisis our dedicated team of teachers, support staff, and administrators
continue to work in concert with the Framingham School Committee and other elected
and appointed City officials in order to best meet the needs of our students and their
families. 
These unprecedented times in our world have, indeed, created hurdles in our
educational system, but we are nimble and few of these hurdles have stood in our way
of getting the job done. When we began developing the FY21 school budget, we were
dealing with Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) and how to manage with weeks of
mandatory indoor recess and the cancellation of afternoon and evening events - events
that are the lifeblood of school culture. It seemed impossible then, but we managed. 
Months later we were faced with a multi-week school closure and the need to reimagine
school for more than 9,000 students. And we are doing that. We are resilient. 
If there is one point that I want to underscore within these several hundred pages of
school budget detail, then it is that the investment that the Framingham community has
made in our schools has been and continues to be a wise investment with returns that
will, in time, pay great dividends in the lives of our children - ALL of our children. 
As such, in the coming fiscal year we are continuing to make necessary investments to
support ALL Framingham public school students. Students who require language
support, individual special education support, social-emotional and behavioral health
support, or a combination of all in order to access the entirety of our curriculum and co-
curricular activities are better served through this proposed budget. Students who 
6
Page 7
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
require alternative learning solutions through our gifted education program and through
expanded early college and career exploration pathways are better served through this
proposed budget. In fact, every line of this budget has been built from zero to ensure
that investments that are made possible through additional legislative actions, like the
Student Opportunity Act as well as funding from the City through local appropriations, 
are felt by every single student in our district. 
I thank you for your confidence in us, your faith and trust in our public education system, 
and for considering the needs that this budget book details. 
Very truly yours, 
Robert A. Tremblay, Ed.D., Superintendent

April 3, 2020
To the City of Framingham: 
In partnership with our Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Robert Tremblay, we submit to
you a responsibly crafted and on time Fiscal Year 2021 budget proposal for the
Framingham Public Schools. As a School Committee, we are responsible for exercising
co-leadership with the Superintendent in the vision, planning, policy making, evaluation, 
and advocacy for the mission of continuous improvement of student achievement in the
district. We are all committed to providing the highest quality education for all students
and strive to do so while presenting a fiscally responsible budget for our community. 
This year’s submission is framed by two major changes and external events. First, the
detrimental impacts of COVID-19 to our community and economy, and second the
positive and long awaited changes to Framingham’s foundation budget and increased
levels of state support from the new Student Opportunity Act. 
We submit this budget during the COVID-19 era of uncertainty, stress, and anxiety
about our way of life, our health, and the future of our education system. With crisis
however comes pride. We are all so proud of our school community. Teachers, 
custodians, nurses, food service employees, secretaries - in fact all FPS staff no matter
what their role have stepped up, along with parents, guardians, and students. Never

before has the meaningful impact schools have on a community been made even more
clear during these times. 
Going forward, we are well aware of the funding levels necessary to provide high quality
education to all students, as well as the tremendous impact the schools have on food
access, social emotional behavioral health, healthy choices, and ultimately the end goal
of college and career readiness. We are also mindful of the state’s requirement to have
a balanced budget and how the economic uncertainty and revenues are likely to impact
our city as well. This budget request was made based on the data and state budget
expectations provided to us at the time of our required submission deadline, many of
which were not yet impacted by COVID-19. As city revenue projections are adjusted, 
federal stimulus allocations become better defined, state aid is finalized, city and state
stabilization funds are potentially used, and other factors influencing the FY20 and FY21
budgets are assessed, the School Committee and FPS will work with all branches of
city government to arrive at a collaborative solution, while also never once losing sight
that they are all fully committed to supporting our school system staff and our students
as they work through a crisis driven paradigm shift in education. This crisis brings a
whole new set of challenges to our important work, whether it be new mental health
services to expand on what is currently offered, to technology for remote learning, for
food security, for remediation to make up for lost in person time on learning due to the
long-term school closures, and more. All of that comes with a price, yet also with high
levels of return on investment. We ask that you please include us in future FY21 budget
meetings to evaluate and decide how to proceed during this crisis. We are ready to
book joint School Committee meetings with the City Council and Mayor as often as
necessary to address this, and prepare for next school year. 
This year is also a groundbreaking year for how the state plans to increase funding for
education. Signed into law in November 2019, the Student Opportunity Act (SOA) 
implements the recommendations of the 2015 Foundation Budget Review Commission
and includes other provisions to benefit public schools over the next seven years. The
main focus of the legislation is to invest in evidence based areas to improve student
outcomes within subgroups who are not achieving at the same high levels as their
peers. Preliminary numbers from the Governor’s budget proposal have Framingham
receiving $4.3 million in SOA funding. As part of this budget, FPS has a SOA
implementation plan built on current programs, and ultimately is proposing to invest in
evidence based initiatives to deepen success. The SOA funding will be utilized to cover
year to year budget increases from enrollment growth, focus on student subgroups who
are not achieving at the same levels as their peers, and seeks to address the various
inequities in existence and the opportunities to support student achievement and social
emotional behavioral health in our schools.

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Fully aligned with the Framingham Public Schools Strategic Plan 2017-2020: Where
Every Child Can and Will Reach High Levels of Achievement, the updated 2021
strategic plan under final stages of development, School Improvement Plans at all
individual schools, and state standards, we submit to you a forward-looking budget
focused on creating pathways to optimize student success. We are seeking support
from the Mayor and City Council of the proposed funding of $147,350,934 for next
year’s Operating Budget. This funding will allow us to continue to build a strong
foundation of high quality instruction with a fully aligned and engaging curriculum. This
budget request is built upon the philosophy of investing in academic achievement, 
supporting employees, establishing access and equity models, enhancing technology, 
improving safety and security, legal compliance, meeting contractual obligations, 
continued streamlining of operations, creating opportunities for innovation, and data-
driven decision making. 
Our Superintendent has built a first rate leadership team in our school district. For the
second straight year, the district built the budget from scratch, requiring that every
resource and every staff position be defended by principals and departments. The
organizational changes in the school system have been profound both on the
instructional and financial fronts. We credit Dr. Tremblay, Mr. Lynch, and the
administration for building this budget with a zero-based mentality and process that
analyzed each expense line and each individual position to ensure that the number of
staff in the budget aligned with class sizes at each school. As you can see in Dr. 
Tremblay’s letter and what follows, this budget clearly expresses what we, as a district, 
value and how we need to invest to achieve the goals, action steps, metrics, and
outcomes expressed in our Strategic Plan. This budget book builds on recent changes
to continue to strive to make the pages which follow a thorough document reflecting all
planned initiatives and is the most complete and comprehensive budget planning
document ever provided by the school department. 
Throughout our district we are so proud to have recent current school year/FY20
success stories showing a strong return on previous investments and reflections that
the Strategic Plan is making tangible progress. This includes the expansion of the
elementary school day, increased number of dual language classrooms, expansion of
robotics and video production in the middle schools, construction of the new Fuller
Middle School, award winning drama and robotics programs, new social emotional
supports, and too many individual achievements by students, recent graduates, and
staff to mention!

With any budget comes the need to plan for year-to-year drivers. This fiscal year, we
have carefully planned for projected increases in enrollment (more than 220 new
students over last school year), Dual Language expansion, new special education
expenditures required by law, and, moreover, increased social, emotional, and
behavioral health initiatives. With this budgetary approval, we also will meet our
contractual obligations by investing in personnel to support student achievement and
professional development. 
The budget was also developed with transparency and community feedback in mind, 
with public forums, meetings, and web-based communications from the fall of 2019 to
the present. This year's process included forums with stakeholders such as Parent
Teacher Organizations, the Bilingual, Dual Language, and Special Education Parents
Advisory Councils, the Framingham Teachers Association, and more, due to the
specific requirements the SOA called for. In full compliance with Article VI of the City
Charter, the School Committee held a public hearing on the budget on March 18, 2020. 
We are grateful to Mayor Spicer for her collaboration with us in developing this budget
as she also serves as a member of the School Committee. The School Committee
appreciates the time and due diligence the Mayor and then the City Council will spend
in reviewing and deliberating on the FY21 Budget for the Framingham Public Schools. 
Framingham Public Schools staff are enthusiastic and willing partners who remain
ready to appear before the Mayor and City Council as we seek final authorization to
enable the continuation of this important work and allow the residents from across our
City to benefit from our collective investments. 
Sincerely,

Introduction and Overview
Mission of the District
The mission of the Framingham Public Schools is to educate each student to learn and
live productively as a critically-thinking, responsible citizen in a multicultural, democratic
society by providing academically challenging instructional programs taught by highly-
qualified staff and supported by comprehensive services in partnership with our entire
community. We envision a school district in which every child is engaged as an active
learner in high-quality educational experiences and is supported, at their level, to ensure
growth over time. We believe that with effective effort, time, and practice, all of our
students can and will reach high levels of achievement and demonstrate college and
career readiness as a result of their course of study in the Framingham Public Schools. 
Our city is enriched and strengthened by its diverse cultural heritage and multinational
population. Within our classrooms and neighborhoods, and on our stages and athletic
fields, we want learning to be relevant and connected to developing our students into
value-centered citizens who are able to navigate a complex and inequitable world. We
aim to address these inequities — including racism, socio-economic status and
language barriers — to create an environment in which every child can and will
succeed. We want our students to feel safe taking academic risks while mindfully
respecting diversity of opinions. To do so, we must foster supportive and collaborative
partnerships between families, the community, and the school district so that every child
reaches a high level of achievement. The foundation of our work is collaboration, mutual
respect, and high expectations, where all educators are reflective of their practice and
feel supported as they continually adjust instruction to improve student performance. 
We are committed to providing a safe and welcoming learning environment in order to
increase achievement and access for all students irrespective of their immigration
status, national origin, ethnicity, race, religion, sexual orientation, sex and gender
identity, socioeconomic status, disability status, and/or beliefs. We are committed to
hardening our facilities through ongoing security improvements and empowering our
students and staff to be proactive in the face of crisis. Our preparedness in this area will
set the stage for an increased focus on learning and teaching. We will continue to
monitor enrollment trends and forecast school building needs as we work together with
City officials to prioritize capital needs so that we always maintain a long-sighted view of
the educational needs of the Framingham Public Schools. 
We strive to afford all Framingham students the opportunity to learn in an educational
environment where the diversity of our students is reflected in our professional staff. We
12
Page 13
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
are committed to respecting human differences and ensuring accountability of actions in
an environment that provides needed resources to support the social-emotional, 
physical, and mental health needs of our students so that they are ready, willing, and
able to engage as learners in the Framingham Public Schools. The Framingham Public
Schools strives to adapt instruction to meet the learning and developmental needs of all
students, including the gifted, through appropriately challenging, high quality, standards-
based instruction. In our efforts to foster an entrepreneurial mindset among students, 
customize learning experiences and opportunities, and nurture equitable and inclusive
learning environments in our schools, we are committed to ensuring the availability of
opportunities that engender equally high outcomes for every learner based on individual
needs - our vision of personalized learning aimed at addressing achievement and
opportunity gaps. 
Framingham Public Schools Core Beliefs
1. Learning is the central purpose of schools
2. Human differences are to be respected
3. Collegiality and professionalism characterize the school community
4. Individuals are responsible for their behavior 
Framingham Public Schools Strategic Plan 2017-2020 
The Framingham Public Schools Strategic Plan: 2017-2020 (Strategic Plan) is framed
by four standards that align directly with the educator evaluation standards developed
by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary & Secondary Education (DESE).
Driven by theories of action within each standard, the Strategic Plan strives to be a
practical resource tool to guide individual school improvement planning and the
development of a responsible, focused budget that is built upon clearly articulated
investments aimed at meeting the needs of Framingham students. 
Standards
Standard I: Curriculum, Planning & Assessment 
Standard II: Teaching All Students 
Standard III: Family and Community Engagement 
Standard IV: Professional Culture 
It stands to reason that if we develop a common understanding of high quality
instruction, including standards-based content knowledge in core content areas, then
students will have more equitable access to rigorous and engaging standards-based
instruction to increase student achievement. The creation of a system and culture of
data-based assessment, including analysis, reflection and feedback, will enable 
13
Page 14
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
educators in the Framingham Public Schools to target effectively the individual needs of
students and purposefully adjust instructional practices accordingly. 
Standard I: Curriculum, Planning & Assessment - High Leverage Goals
1. Develop a shared understanding of high quality instruction, including content and
instructional strategies, by all staff and executed in all classrooms and

then we are underscoring and making real the central mission of the Framingham Public
Schools. By delivering targeted supports and interventions using a data-driven
approach, students will receive differentiated instruction aligned with individual needs to
optimize their success. If there is an emphasis on rigor and excellence
in all aspects of our educational system, then we are establishing appropriately
challenging expectations for all students with the expectation that all students can and
will reach high levels of achievement. 
Standard II: Teaching All Students - High Leverage Goals
1. Promote academic achievement and social and emotional growth for all students
2. Deliver targeted supports and interventions based on the analysis of data and
identification of student-specific need

FY21 Budget - A Collaborative Effort
The Framingham Public Schools Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21) Budget is designed to be
reciprocal with the Framingham Public Schools Strategic Plan and aligned with
individual school improvement plans. Each individual school improvement plan is
framed by four standards that align directly with the educator evaluation standards
developed by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary & Secondary Education
(DESE). The Strategic Plan strives to be a practical resource tool to guide individual
school improvement planning and the development of a responsible, focused budget
that is built upon clearly articulated investments aimed at meeting the needs of all
Framingham students. The budget, while driven by the Strategic plan, strives to ensure
access and equity across the District by incorporating a zero-based mindset. Many
hours were invested in the development of the proposed FY21 budget in order to
achieve this. The proposed budget is thorough and reflects a collaborative effort that
could only have been completed with a significant amount of work put in by school
principals and their staff, department heads and their staff, central office administrators
and their staff, the Framingham School Committee, the City CFO and Mayor Spicer. 
The team has put forth a responsible, forward-looking plan that is aimed at driving
student achievement through strategic investments as well as personnel and program
efficiencies. 
The budget development schedule is included in a previous section of the budget book
to show the amount of time that was dedicated to the process by all those involved. The
budget process focused on the needs of all Framingham students as well as on moving
the District forward. The effort to build the FY21 budget began with a zero-based
budget model that focused on class sizes, personnel analysis, and an analysis of each
expense budget line. Each new request for FY21 required an explanation/justification in
order to be considered in the budget. A strong effort was put forth to ensure that current
20

FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
(FY20) staffing, which is expected to be carried to FY21, will be appropriate for the
enrollment of the 2020-2021 school year. The analysis of each new position request
and each expense request was conducted during the process. During the entire FY21
budget process, the team understood that the City receives a limited amount of
revenues, yet confidently put forth a fiscally reasonable budget to the Mayor that
supports all Framingham students. 
FY21 Proposed Budget - $147,350,934 increase of $8,865,948 or 6.40% 
The FY21 budget is projected to serve over 9,200 in-district students located in
one preschool, nine elementary schools, three middle schools, one alternative
high school, and one high school. The proposed budget also supports a
projected 217 out-of-district students receiving instruction in special education
programs both in and out of the Commonwealth. The proposed budget of 
$147,350,934 is an increase of $8,865,948, or 6.40%, over the FY20 budget of
$138,484,986. 
The FY21 proposed budget includes $105,465,063 in level service salaries, 
$4,988,713 in level additional salaries (overtime, stipends, substitutes, athletic
coaches, etc.), $33,425,106 in operational expenses, and $3,472,052 in new
positions to be added to the level salaries budget total. The proposed FY21
budget closely follows the current Strategic Plan while moving the District
further towards excellence and equity for all students. 
Budget Drivers 
1. Collective Bargaining Contracts - The major budget driver of most, if not all, School
District budgets is personnel costs. Framingham has six unions that each has a
negotiated, collectively bargained contract that drives personnel costs from year to year. 
The cost of living adjustment percentages (COLA), increases a union member’s salary
each year, along with possible step increases within the salary grid. In some union
contracts, personnel are able to move from lane to lane based on their education
accomplishments. The following provides the Cost of Living Adjustment percentages for
all union contracts in the Framingham Public Schools; these have either been ratified or
are assumed based on ongoing negotiations: 
Unit A Teachers: 1.65% 
Unit B Administrators: 2.0% 
Unit C Custodians: 2.0% assumed (no contract due to current negotiations) 
21

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Unit N Food Services: 2.0% o impact on Operating Budget) 
Unit P Principals: 0.0% - 3.0% (varies based on contracts and performance) 
Unit S Administrative Support: 2.0% 
Unit T Educational Support: 2.0% 
Unit V Non-Bargaining: Increases vary based on individual contracts 
Other changes to contracts in addition to COLA driving the budget
a. 0.25 Hours added to each Elementary Unit T member’s work day. Projected
FY21 added cost is $165,779.44. 
b. 2.0 Days added to each 10-month Unit S member’s work year and increase of
$300 to longevity amounts for all Unit S members that receive longevity. 
Projected FY21 added cost is $20,614.00. 
c. $10.00 increase to all substitute teacher daily rates in addition to the $10.00
increase implemented in January 2020. Projected FY21 increase to substitute
budget is $274,000. 
2. Student Opportunity Act - Chapter 132 of the Acts of 2019 - An act relative to
educational opportunities for students (see section of SOA) 
a. Chapter 70 funding increased based on the Student Opportunity Act. FY21
Chapter 70 funding increased by $7,089,523. DESE recommends that the
minimum Chapter 70 amount goes towards ongoing or new Student Opportunity
Act Programs for year 1 (FY21).
b. Intention of the Student Opportunity Act is to focus on student subgroups who
are not achieving at the same high level as their peers and adopt, deepen or
continue specific evidence based programs to close opportunity and
achievement gaps. 
3. Federal and State Grant Funding - Projecting level funding for all Federal and State
grants. Private grants are not assumed in this proposed budget and will be managed
without an effect on the operating budget. Total funding is assumed at
$7,555,734.00. 
a. FY21 Earmark Funding Request: $300,000 in funding for Social Emotional
Learning from Senator Spilka’s Office 
4. Student Transportation - Home to School transportation is a 2.5% increase from
year four (FY20) to year five which is the final year of the current contract with Durham
School Services. In FY20, 76 total buses transport over 7,000 students on a daily basis. 
The request for FY21 will be to add a bus to bring the fleet up to 77 buses to
accommodate the increase in enrollment seen District-wide. Bus fees are charged to
students who ride the bus and live less than 2.0 miles from their school at a cost of 
22
Page 23
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
$250 per student with a family cap of $500. The total operating cost for Home to School
transportation is offset by fees in the amount of $300,000. After the offset from fees, 
the operating cost to run 77 buses is $5,249,957. 
5. FY21 Special Education Circuit Breaker Reimbursement - The state special
education reimbursement program, commonly known as the “circuit breaker program”,
was started in FY04 to provide additional state funding to districts for high-cost special
education students. The threshold for eligibility is tied to four times the state average
foundation budget per pupil as calculated under the Chapter 70 program, with the state
paying up to 75 percent of the costs above that threshold. For fiscal year 2021 the Act
sets the threshold at $45,793 and, for the first time, includes out-of-district transportation
costs required by individualized education programs for students with disabilities. The
Act calls for the state paying 25 percent of eligible costs, which is 50 percent of the total
out-of-district transportation costs. 
The example below demonstrates how the Circuit Breaker formula for tuition
reimbursements is applied:

Claim Amount: 50% of Total Costs 
Reimbursement of 25% 
4,000,000
2,000,000
500,000 
For children placed in a school district outside their home town by the Department of
Transitional Assistance or the Department of Children and Families, and for children
who have no parents or guardians in the Commonwealth, the reimbursement is 100
percent above the threshold rather than 75 percent. (The Department of Children and 
23
Page 24
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Families is the new name for the Department of Social Services.)
Circuit Breaker reimbursements are for the district's prior year's expenses. Each
summer, districts submit claim forms to the Department of Elementary and Secondary
Education (DESE) listing the types and amounts of special education instructional
services provided to each student during the previous fiscal year. Administrative and
overhead costs are not reimbursable. Standard rates for each type of service are
established annually by DESE, based on statewide surveys, and are used to calculate
the reimbursable cost for each student; this simplifies the claim process and minimizes
the documentation which needs to be submitted. For students attending private 766
schools, the eligible cost for reimbursement is based on the approved tuition rate set by
the state's Operational Services Division. 
Payments are made to districts on a quarterly basis, and because the program is
subject to appropriation, the first quarter's payments are usually calculated using an
interim reimbursement rate of less than 75 percent. After all the claim forms have been
received and reviewed, and DESE verifies that there are sufficient appropriations to pay
all claims, the reimbursements are recalculated using the full percent rate. 
Circuit breaker claims are audited by MA DESE, and adjustments are made to future
payments in the event of disallowed costs. The biggest reason for costs being
disallowed is that the services have not been clearly documented on a student's IEP. 
Only services that are required by the IEP are eligible for reimbursement. 
Circuit breaker reimbursements are deposited into a special education reimbursement
account. These funds may be expended by the school committee in the year received
or in the following fiscal year for any special education-related purposes, without further
appropriation. As with all special revenues, the appropriating authority can and should
consider the projected reimbursements for the following fiscal year when deliberating on
the school District's general fund budget. 
The projected FY21 Circuit Breaker reimbursement number factored into the FY21
proposed budget is $5,958,633. The rate used for reimbursement is 75%. Circuit
Breaker funds offset out of district special education tuition operating budget line. An
additional $500,000 is included in the FY21 budget based on the NEW out of district
special education transportation reimbursement formula. The $500,000 is reflected as
an offset to the out of district special education transportation budget line. The rate used
is 50%, which is lower than the potential maximum percent allowed of 75%. The reason
to use a lower percentage is if the reimbursement rate is not at the maximum amount, 
the District will have to make up the difference in order to fulfill transportation
obligations.

6. FY20 Special Education Circuit Breaker Reimbursement* - Special Education
Circuit Breaker reimbursements may be expended to cover out of district tuition costs in
the year reimbursements are distributed or in the following fiscal year. 
The FY21 proposed budget includes the use of FY20 Circuit Breaker Reimbursement
funds in the amount of $1,500,000 to offset the total FY21 request. 
*Per DESE Website: Since DESE regulations allow communities and school districts to
carry forward up to one year's worth of state reimbursement, Department of Local
Services (DLS) advises communities build balances in their SPED circuit breaker
accounts in years when actual costs compare favorably with the budget so that in years
when SPED costs increase unexpectedly or the circuit breaker reimbursement drops, 
there will be some circuit breaker revenue to cover any unforeseen costs. Building a
circuit breaker balance is a good management practice as it eliminates some of the risk
associated with these unpredictable SPED costs. 
7. Special Education Tuition and Transportation costs - FY21 projects to cover 216
out of district placements for students and provide transportation to and from programs, 
as needed. The total FY21 costs are projected to be $19,380,516.95 for all out of
district student tuitions. The total cost is offset by $5,958,633 of projected FY21 Circuit
Breaker funding described above combined with an offset of $1,500,000 of FY20
carryover Circuit Breaker funding for a total offset of $7,458,633. The FY21 proposed
budget includes $11,921,883.95 in out of district tuition costs. 
Out of district transportation costs are estimated at $4,000,000 for FY21. These costs
are offset by $2,207,350 of the 240 Special Education Grant funding and $500,000 of
FY21 Circuit Breaker transportation reimbursement funding (new for FY21 and based
on the SOA requirements). The FY21 proposed budget includes $1,292,650 in out of
district transportation costs. 
8. Buildings & Grounds and Utilities - Permit fees collected and deposited into the
facilities revolving account for the use of School buildings in the amount of $150,000 will
be used to offset the operating budget. The Buildings and Grounds FY21 budget
supports the maintenance of all buildings and utility costs to the District. Projected
maintenance costs for FY21 are approximately $1.7 million and include, but are not
limited to, equipment repair, service contracts, supplies, tools, non-instructional
equipment and vehicle maintenance. Utility costs are projected at $2,325,000 for FY21
and include electric costs, natural gas costs and telephone service costs.

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
9. New Position Requests - The total request for new positions is in the amount of
$3,472,052 which equals 57.4 positions. These additions will assist the District fulfill
legal requirements, meet contract requirements and fully support our students and staff
through the Student Opportunity Act. At this time many positions are required by policy
and contract as mentioned which will allow the District to keep class sizes at required
levels. 
Initiatives and Investments 
1. Student Opportunity Act(SOA)- Chapter 132 of the Acts of 2019 - An act
relative to educational opportunities for students - The District is committed to
invest in and commit to focus on specific student subgroups. Funds will be allocated
to adopt, deepen or continue specific evidence based programs to close gaps. The
investments and initiatives will be monitored for success and outcomes. The SOA
long form required by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education will
be presented to the School Committee for a vote in the near future. The budget book
will be updated with the specific SOA plan after the School Committee vote. 
Intention of the Student Opportunity Act
Focuses on student subgroups who are not achieving at the same high level as their
peers & adopt, deepen or continue specific evidence based programs to close
opportunity and achievement gaps. 
Student Opportunity Act Observations

2. Safety and Security - The District continues to make the safety of our students, our
staff, our volunteers, our visitors and all others that visit our buildings and grounds a top
priority. An increase to the Safety and Security operating budget will allow for additional
safety measures to be taken such as cameras, radios, access controls and additional
professional development opportunities for students and staff. 
3. Technology - District hardware such as chromebooks and laptops need to be
replaced in order to provide students and staff with the best possible resources. An
increase to the operating budget is requested in the amount of $433,440 in order to get
new devices into the hands of students and staff
4. Student Achievement - The District has requested $3,472,052 which equals 57.4
positions. This investment will support students across the District (list to be included) 
Efficiencies
1. Zero-based budgeting - Expense budget requests and salary budget requests are
based on a zero-based mindset. The intent and idea is not simply to give a percent
increase to the previous year’s budget but to start from scratch and identify the needs. 
The instruction from the Business Office was to start from scratch and only request what
29
Page 30
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
the building or department needed. 
2. Special Education Transportation - The District is in year two of a three year
contract with Vanpool, the vendor that provides our special education students
transportation to and from out of district placements. The District made the decision to
move away from another vendor for the 2019-2020 school year as we sought
efficiencies. In FY20, the District saved approximately $500,000 by switching vendors
and contracting with VanPool. 
3. Bulk Purchasing - The District procures materials and supplies through The
Education Collaborative Cooperative Purchasing Program. The District also participates
in programs through WB Mason, Staples and Home Depot that provide the District with
competitive pricing. 
4. Class Size Analysis - Class sizes across the District were analyzed to make sure
each was directly and appropriately correlated with assigned personnel to each class. 
At the elementary level, shifts were made to support enrollment changes from one
grade level to another within and across buildings. District enrollment is projected to
increase by 220 students. 
5. Instructional Materials - To continue to allow for access and equity across the
District, instructional supply requests for all K-5 schools are calculated using the
algorithm below. 
6. Athletic Transportation - The District will continue to utilize 15-passenger buses for
field trips and small athletic teams. The District saves several hundred dollars every
time the 15-passenger is utilized instead of using a large school bus through a
transportation vendor. The Athletic Department operating budget has seen a significant
savings in the transportation budget line due to this shift.

Office of the Assistant Superintendent for Equity, Diversity and
Community Development 
The Office for Equity, Diversity, and Community Development (EDCD) advances the
Framingham Public Schools commitment to equity, diversity and community
engagement by working to ensure a safe education and work environment for all. It
champions and values the diversity of our district and works to eliminate bias and
discrimination from impeding success for all. It recognizes the crucial role families and
community partners play in supporting our work. EDCD will work with community and 
33
Page 34
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
business partners to develop and align resources aimed at eliminating barriers and
expanding learning access for all students. 
The budget put forth by EDCD reflects an intention to establish the basic infrastructure
of the Office while allowing for the completion of the equity audit and the inclusion of
students, families in staff in an authentic, intentional planning process. Our goal is to
develop initiatives that will increase culturally responsive teaching, expand individual
capacity to engage in diversity and inclusion discussions, disrupt the legacy of systemic
racism, and create a school culture that is proactively responsive to the needs of
students, families, staff and our greater Framingham community. 
In FY20 the EDCD focused on building the infrastructure of the office. The weight of two
audits (Title IX and Equity) along with varying school needs related to investigations and
mediations truly stretched our capacity. This limited our implementation plans to expand
family and community engagement across the District. For FY21 EDCD will focus on
implementing recommendations laid out in the equity audit report. Funding has been
requested to add an additional staff member to meet a growing workload. The Office is
looking to standardize processes and communication across the District to ensure clear
and easy access for families. For family and community engagement, funding has been
sought to provide resources in order to establish a District team committed to organizing
and coordinating family engagement events. Currently these events are organized by
individual departments, leading to inconsistent practice and siloed work. By establishing
a District team, we can provide collective support to coordinate events as well as
expand opportunities to increase access to families who struggle to participate in the
current engagement opportunities. 
Built into the budget are funds to provide training and certification in Title IX, 504, ADA
and Bullying/Harassment for all investigative positions. The commitment to ongoing
professional development for these positions is crucial to ensuring that all staff tasked
with this work has the knowledge, skills, and resources to manage this work effectively. 
Additional funding has been requested to provide staff with professional development
relating to diversity and inclusion initiatives. Many schools struggle to meet the complex
needs of students and families, so by providing funding for training, the Office of Equity
can ensure a quick turnaround regarding training and support for schools in the midst of
crisis.

Office of
Bilingual Education 
The number of students who are
learning English as an additional
language (ESL) and require direct
instruction has increased at twice the
rate as the general education
population within the last three years in
Massachusetts. According to the
Massachusetts Department of
Elementary and Secondary Education, 
Framingham Public Schools is listed among the 15 largest districts in MA enrolling
English Learners (ELs). Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1974 requires districts to take
appropriate steps to address the language barriers that prevent ELs from accessing
curriculum. Further, No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001, and its successor, the
Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), each address specific requirements for
supporting ELs’ access to education. 
35
Page 36
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Promoting the academic
achievement of linguistically
diverse students continues to be a
priority for the Office of Bilingual
Education. Nearly 46% 
of all FPS students speak another
language, in addition to English, at
home, and 26% of FPS students
are identified as ELs and require
instructional support in their
acquisition of English. Today, 
these students speak 45 different
languages, with the two largest
groups speaking Spanish (mostly Central American countries) and Brazilian
Portuguese. Per federal and state laws, initial identification of English Learners is a
legal mandate; the District must assess students who speak a language other than
English at home upon registration. Since July 1, 2019 the Language Assessment Office
has screened approximately 759 incoming students. Therefore, requests through the
Bilingual FY21 budget continue to be for teachers, coaches, and paraprofessionals to
provide direct service to students and for additional funds for resources and materials
for the classrooms. 
The [URL: "http://www.doe.mass.edu/ell/look-act.html"] Look Act, signed into law in November 2017, provides districts with more flexibility
as to the types of language acquisition programs designed to meet the needs of
English Learners and ensures accountability for timely and effective English language
acquisition. Strengthening successful program models: Sheltered English Immersion, 
(SEI), Transitional Bilingual Education (TBE), and Two-Way (TW), and the expansion
of Dual Language (DL) programs in Spanish and Portuguese at Brophy, Potter and
Wilson is a priority for FY21. Continuing with the expansion of DL programs, four out of
the nine elementary schools will be offering DL programs in FY21. Additional funds in
the expense budget are being requested for texts and materials in the native languages
to support DL instruction and professional development.

Office of Teaching & Learning
The Office of Teaching and Learning is focused on providing equitable access to high
quality instruction for all students. The Office Is responsible for all aspects of instruction, 
curriculum, assessment, and professional development for grades pre-Kindergarten
through 12. This oversight is linked to the growth and achievement of approximately 350
preschoolers, over 4,500 elementary students, over 2,000 middle school students, and
37
Page 38
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
over 2,300 students at the high school. The Office is also responsible for the training
and support of over 1,800 staff members within Framingham Public Schools. This
support is provided in a wide array of areas that are aligned to the District Strategic Plan
and includes the review and development of curriculum, selection of instructional
materials, monitoring of local and state assessments, analysis of data at the school and
district level, and targeted professional development to meet curricular and instructional
needs. 
Curriculum and Instruction
The District takes pride in the rich diversity of its student population. As stated in our
2017-2020 District Strategic Plan, “The Framingham Public Schools strives to adapt
instruction to meet the learning and developmental needs of all students, including the
gifted, through appropriately challenging, high quality, standards-based instruction. In
our efforts to foster an entrepreneurial mindset among students, customize learning
experiences and opportunities, and nurture equitable and inclusive learning
environments in our schools, we are committed to ensuring the availability of
opportunities that engender equally high outcomes for every learner based on individual
needs - our vision of personalized learning aimed at addressing achievement and
opportunity gaps.” This is the driver for all decisions made across the District, from the
selection of curricular materials to the scheduling of staff. The focus of the Office of
Teaching and Learning is to provide consistent expectations and procedures for
equitable and high-quality instruction for all students and to monitor the implementation
of these expectations and procedures. 
This year we have continued to build and implement structures to ensure all students
are afforded equitable opportunities. We have implemented a consistent schedule
across all nine elementary schools to provide all students with equal access to specials. 
Similarly, at the middle school level, we now have a consistent schedule so all students
have the same opportunities for academic blocks, specials, interventions, and
enrichment experiences. We have expanded our practice of calibrated walkthroughs to
include all secondary evaluators (department heads and building administrators) and all
secondary schools. These monthly classroom visit rounds have provided school
leaders from across the middle schools and high school the opportunity to work
collaboratively to establish clear expectations for their observations. The Office of
Teaching and Learning has also revised our leadership meeting structure to now
include two meetings each month with school administrators: one meeting for principals
to deliver information and identify areas in need of support, and one meeting with each
school’s full administrative team to analyze data and build action plans. We have
continued to communicate and support teachers in our expectations around the
components of a lesson, and have provided professional development to support this 
38
Page 39
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
high priority goal. Through the lens of Universal Design for Learning, we are building the
District’s capacity to remove barriers within a lesson or classroom so that all students
can access the content and achieve at a high level. We continue to review our
curriculum in alignment with the 7-year curriculum review cycle with equity and diversity
in mind. For example, as part of our English Language Arts curriculum work, the
committee is making a concerted effort to select texts that provide both windows and
mirrors for our students. Our priority is to invest our resources in providing high quality
materials that will motivate, support, and challenge all of our students so that all children
are engaged and feel connected to their learning. 
As part of this work, the Office of Teaching and Learning continually evaluates systems, 
practices, and resources to ensure they meet the needs of our students and educators. 
In 2020-2021, we will continue classroom visit rounds and structured data meetings with
administrative teams. This work has proven itself to be invaluable in creating
opportunities for school and district leaders to make decisions to improve outcomes for
students. Regarding curriculum, we will continue to follow our 7-year curriculum review
cycle, which includes ongoing revision based on feedback resulting from
implementation. We will develop common assessments to monitor the effectiveness of
curriculum and make adjustments accordingly. We will also continue to roll out our new
Technology Education curriculum at the middle school level, which now includes
robotics and coding for all students. We will implement a new 8th grade Algebra 1
curriculum that is currently being developed in collaboration with high school math
teachers so that the updated course is aligned to the high school Algebra 1 Honors
curriculum. We will monitor and support new courses at the high school, including
increased Advanced Placement offerings and a Biotechnology course that is currently in
development. 
Assessment
The District has a clear purpose and system for reviewing state-level data and efficiently
collecting district and school level assessment and outcome data. The District has
worked to create an assessment profile for students that includes multiple sources of
data including diagnostic and formative assessments, summative assessments, 
attendance, discipline, and parent and student surveys. This has included ongoing, 
regular conversations with District and school based leaders that provides a
comprehensive picture of student, school, and district performance and focuses on the
analysis of these multiple sources of data. Now that these systems are in place, we are
working on promoting and sustaining a culture of shared responsibility and
accountability for assessing performance and taking actions that lead to improved
outcomes for all students while also taking into account the many variables that can
impact student achievement and growth. This includes a focus on the achievement and
39
Page 40
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
growth of all students with a targeted focus on ensuring that barriers are removed for
students of color, those receiving special education services, those receiving services
as an English Learner, as well as gifted and economically disadvantaged students. To
this end, the District has been able to utilize the iReady diagnostic and instructional
software as a calibration tool in grades K-8. The District also invested in Imagine
Learning to provide the same support for English Language Learners while addressing
the specific needs of this population. 
Listed below is the progress that has been made as a District in grades 1-8 in Reading. 
Tier I (as shown in green) outlines the number of students performing on or above
grade level. This number increased from 34% of students in the Fall of 2019 to 45% of
students in the Winter of 2020. Tier III (as shown in red) outlines the number of
students performing two or more grade levels below. This number decreased from 35% 
of students in the Fall of 2019 to 27% of students in the Winter of 2020. Students will be
assessed again at the end of the school year.

It should be noted that Kindergarten is assessed using this tool twice a year and, 
therefore, progress cannot yet be noted. 
Professional Development
The Office of Teaching and Learning is responsible for providing all professional
development related to curriculum, instruction, and assessment. Professional
development is provided through the District's professional development days, new
teacher orientation days, mentoring, extension courses, online courses, off-site
conferences, and on-site workshops. Some of this training is supported through the
Title IIA grant, but a significant portion of the District's professional development is
funded by the operating budget. Due to the size of the District's staff and wide variety
of specialty areas, the District's need for professional development always exceeds our
ability to provide this support in terms of time and funding. Therefore, the Office of
Teaching and Learning must take into account curriculum revision and purchases, 
software initiatives, revision of curriculum to align to updated standards, and our
strategy for calibrating expectations and procedures across the District when creating
the professional development calendar and related opportunities each fiscal year. With
this in mind, the Office of Teaching and Learning continues to make decisions about 
our professional development offerings based on District goals and available funds.

Office of Health and Wellness
The Department of Health and Wellness (H&W) promotes Framingham Public Schools’ 
academic mission by supporting the social, emotional, academic, and physical growth
and development of our diverse student population and the greater school community. 
At the heart of the department’s activities is the fundamental premise that students learn
best when they are physically and emotionally at their best. H&W is comprised of
nurses, social workers, school counselors, psychologists, social emotional behavior
coaches, and the Social Emotional Mental Health Team (SEMH).
H&W is committed to supporting all aspects of our students’ health and wellbeing. 
Encouraging our students’ physical, social, emotional and behavioral growth through the
creation of supportive learning environments is essential to their school and life
success. Our efforts over the past two years and in the foreseeable future are focused
on creating and implementing a coordinated comprehensive approach to promoting
student growth in these areas. 
School Health Services: Full-time skilled nurses in every school provide high quality
comprehensive school health services to students. Two adolescent health nurses work
throughout the District to provide specialized services related to students’ reproductive
health. The Edward M. Kennedy Health Center school-based health center at
Framingham High School provides comprehensive medical services to enrolled 
42
Page 43
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
students, including immunizations, physicals, sports physicals, and treatment of
illnesses. Boston University Goldman School of Dental Medicine provides its dental
sealant program to FPS's third graders. 
Student Support Services: Each school in the district is staffed by student support
personnel, including: school counselors who support students in the areas of academic
achievement, personal/social development and college and career readiness; 
psychologists who provide services such as assessment, consultation, evaluation, 
intervention, prevention, and planning; and social workers whose work involves bridging
school, home, and community in an effort to assist students be as successful as
possible. 
Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports (PBIS): Six years ago, FPS identified
 PBIS as its behavior framework to address a range of social, emotional, and behavioral
needs of students in grades PreK-8. PBIS is a research proven tiered framework that
uses proactive strategies to teach clearly defined behavioral expectations and provides
targeted support for students in need of more social, emotional, or behavioral support
through a data driven identification process. Schools have an identified PBIS
administrator, a PBIS coach, and a school-based team. Tier 1 has been established in
each building, and schools are moving forward with Tier 2 implementation for more
targeted interventions, such as social skills groups, behavior plans, and mentoring
programs. 
Mental Health and Behavioral Services: The SEMH team is staffed by three
professionals with expertise in child clinical psychology, applied behavior analysis, 
special education, program development and management, crisis response, and staff
training. The SEMH team supports schools by problem-solving challenging student
cases, review of school systems, and provision of focused skill-building support for staff
regarding specific areas of mental health and/or behavior planning. Social emotional
behavior coaches in our Title I schools implement systems and structures that support
increased positive school culture for students, staff, and families through a focus on
building positive relationships, shared vision, and a growth mindset that is embedded
throughout the school. 
Attendance: Across FPS, a large number of our students are missing a significant
amount of school. During the 2018-19 school year, 34% of our students missed 10 or
more days and 14% of our students were chronically absent - missing 10% or more of
school days due to an absence of any reason - excused, unexcused, or suspension. 
When school attendance is made a priority, children get better grades, develop healthy
life habits, avoid dangerous behavior and have a better chance of graduating from high
school. Schools are integrating tiered interventions to support improved student

social, emotional development and academic growth. 
* Restorative practices refer to a range of methods and strategies, which can be used
both to prevent relationship-damaging incidents from happening and to resolve them if
they do happen. Restorative practices enable those who have been harmed to convey
the impact of the harm to those responsible, and for those responsible to acknowledge
this impact and take steps to put it right. Becoming a restorative school has many
benefits, including increased attendance, reduced exclusions and improved
achievement.

include the following: 
46
Page 47
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
●  Personnel: Building a comprehensive program will, in some instances, require
the hiring of additional highly skilled support personnel. 
●  Professional Development: Necessary to assure the competence of all
support staff/educators to provide appropriate strategies, interventions, and
support. Funds are requested to provide specialized staff with professional
development opportunities to maintain professional licensure. Funds are
also requested for continued [URL: "https://www.responsiveclassroom.org/"] Responsive Classroom training* for
educators, as well as [URL: "https://www.qbs.com/safety-care/"] Safety Care state-mandated de-escalation/restraint
training. 
●  School Health Services Supplies & Equipment: A significant portion of the
budget is allocated to purchasing general supplies for the school health rooms
as well as equipment, such as vision and hearing machines. 
●  Contractual Services: The FY21 budget request includes funds to contract for
technical assistance, including: PBIS May Institute to provide consultation and
technical assistance to the FPS PBIS Coordinator to deliver in-district
professional development and access to off campus PD and networking; and
the Learning Center for the Deaf to support our hearing impaired students. 
These costs have typically been covered by district operating funds. 
●  Contractual Services: The FY21 request also includes funds to contract for
technical assistance including, Brookline Center for Community Mental Health
(BRYT) to provide support to the FHS and Cameron Bridge programs and
increasing Tier 3 supports and programming for students with significant mental
health and behavioral challenges at the elementary level; Engaging Schools to
plan and implement research-based youth development opportunities and
supports at the high school and 3 middle schools as well as support the
implementation phase of the revised district Code of Character, Conduct, and
Support. These costs have previously been covered by H&W grant/earmark
funding. They are included in the FY21 budget request in the event
grant/earmark funds are not secured. 
*Responsive Classroom is a student-centered, social and emotional learning approach
to teaching and discipline. It consists of a set of research, and evidence-based
practices designed to create safe, joyful, and engaging classroom and school
communities for both students and teachers.

Office of Human Resources
The Office of Human Resources is responsible for coordinating the recruitment, 
selection, appointment, and promotion of all district employees with the goal of
maintaining a dynamic and efficient staff who are committed to providing outstanding
educational programs. Diversity among teachers undoubtedly advances the academic

achievement of students. Compliance obligations establish the baseline; as a District, 
Framingham Public Schools are committed to achieving, developing and maintaining a
workforce reflective of the rich racial, linguistic, and cultural diversity of our students. 
Framingham Public Schools aims to teach our children, and ourselves, to be culturally
proficient and inclusive in order to live, learn, and work together in a vibrant and diverse
world. Our goal is to reflect the diverse community we serve and create a great place to
work for everyone by embracing the individual skills, perspectives and experiences our
people bring to the workplace and harnessing these for high performance and improved
service delivery. We want our employees to feel included, valued and respected and
have access to equal opportunities, which supports full participation at work. The Office
of Human Resource is dedicated to the goal of building a culturally diverse and
pluralistic faculty committed to teaching and working in a multicultural environment and
seeks to retain the diverse talent in our workforce and support our people to maintain a
long and productive working career. 
The Office currently consists of an Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources, an
Assistant Director of Human Resources, an HR Manager, three HR Generalists, and an
Administrative Assistant. The team in the Office of Human Resources processes all the
HR-related needs of the District, including compliance with state and federal regulations
and compliance with contractual requirements. The Office processes all hires, 
terminations, leaves, salary changes, stipends, reimbursements, retirements, longevity
payments, etc. In addition, it collaborates with all departments, offers support and
guidance to supervisors with the supervision and evaluation, establishes hiring practices
and procedures, ascertains faculty qualifications, listens to staff concerns and
contractual grievance hearing, conducts investigations, negotiates contracts, maintains
personnel files, creates job descriptions, collaborates with and acts as a conduit to
Payroll, etc. We aspire to be a friendly customer-focused staff, and our goal is to meet
the needs of each of our customers, the employees of Framingham Public Schools. 
The trend in the Office has been to establish efficiencies through human resources
information technology ("HRIS"). TalentEd is now used for hiring, onboarding, keeping
personnel records and supervision and evaluation forms and documents as well as to
hire employees. Moreover, we have expanded the Frontline system through which we
manage absences to keep accurate time for hourly employees and thereby diminish the
liability of the district under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Through this expansion, the
Office of Human Resources and the City Payroll Department were able to automate
data entry tasks in order to provide cost savings, improved processes, reliability, and
increased productivity.

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
The Office has also undertaken more oversight and responsibility from the City Payroll
Department, especially in the management of the payroll process across all schools and
departments and the maintenance and updating of all accruals. 
Our budget for 2020-2021 continues to be mainly focused on the recruitment and
retention of staff. With that, we are also continuing to streamline processes to ensure
efficiency and promote customer service.

School Committee
Policy, budget and hiring/supervision of the Superintendent are the three main
functions of the School Committee. In the area of Policy, the School Committee
reviews, revises or creates policies that support all stakeholders of Framingham
Public Schools by engaging key members of the school community. This work is
undertaken by the Policy Subcommittee on an on-going basis. As a committee, it
needs to be aware of statutory changes, local, state and federal mandates and
changes, to ensure its policies are up-to-date. In the budget area, the School
Committee works through its Finance Subcommittee to create, monitor and propose
an operating budget to the Mayor for the school district. Additional Subcommittees
for the 2020-2021 term include: Buildings & Grounds; Teaching & Learning; Equity, 
Inclusion, and Diversity; Health and Wellness; and Climate Change, Environment, 
and Sustainability. 
51
Page 52
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
The School Committee works closely with the Framingham legislative delegation in
advocating for more resources for Chapter 70 and Circuit Breaker funding as well as
for legislation that could improve the work of our district. Historically, the School
Committee has been a strong advocate at the Massachusetts Association of School
Committees in having many of their resolutions passed by the Delegate Assembly at
the annual state convention. In the area of supervision/evaluation of the
Superintendent, the School Committee establishes annual goals with the
Superintendent and standards by which his evaluation will be conducted by the
School Committee. This is a public process that unfolds over the course of the year
and provides a public conversation about the goals and objectives of the school
district as contained in policy, the operating budget, and the evaluation of the
Superintendent. 
The School Committee budget consists of stipends provided for each member in the
City Charter, the Executive Assistant’s salary, and operational costs. While planning for
the 2020 budget the School Committee took a deeper look into their budget and
rearranged some items, moving them to responsibility centers that seemed more
accurate for the costs, and to be able to track the funds more accurately. Another
consideration was upcoming terms ending and an election, which brought new
members on who may need additional training or resources, leading to an increase in
the funds for professional development. The 2018-2020 School Committee also voted
on and approved transparency measures including the use of electronic recording
devices for all subcommittee meetings, and transcription contracting services if
requested by the Subcommittee Chairs. The School Committee continues to be a
member of MASC, which offers many trainings, services, resources, and online
management of the policy manual, most of which is included in the MASC annual dues
that are paid for out of this budget. For 2021, the School Committee is looking to
maintain most of their department budget the same, with possible increases for further
professional development. They will also be pursuing additional work with MASC to
take a further look into all policies that are currently in the policy manual, and determine
what may need to be changed, removed, or added. The last review of this nature was
in 2012.

The Office of Grants Development
The Grants Development Office (GDO) is responsible for developing process, 
procedures and providing operational support to ensure best practice grant
management and compliance for the district. The GDO's goal is to develop and
implement strategies for grants and partners funded resources for programs and
services to promote student learning, teacher and curriculum development, and District
capacity for teaching and learning innovation to improve its performance outcomes at all 
levels across the board. The team ensures collaboration cross-functionally, with mutual
accountability, a shared vision and responsibility with all partners, departments, 
programs, schools, district and community to provide support to improve students' 
achievement and close the achievement gap in a culture of equity and proficiency. GDO
monitors, administers, and implements over $1.7 million in Title I funds to ensure the
operation and compliance of the Title I Program according to Federal and State
guidelines in accordance with ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act). The GDO oversees
programmatic and financial review of all grants within the District totaling over $7.5
million respectfully (carry-over funds not inclusive).

Office of Business Operations
The Office of Business Operations is responsible for maintaining accounting and
financial record-keeping for the District. The Office oversees Transportation, Grants, 
Food Services, Safety & Security and Buildings & Grounds. The staffing in the Business
Operations Office includes the Executive Director of Finance and Operations, the
Assistant Director of Finance, the Salary Accounts Manager, and four Accounts Payable
Specialists. 
The Business Office provides financial reports to all Responsibility Centers (RCs) 
and is responsible for recommending budget transfers, as needed, to the School
Committee for approval consistent with School Committee Policy. The Office is also
responsible for developing and distributing financial information to the School
Committee's Finance Sub-Committee and may also develop financial reports on
various budget items as needed by the administration or the City. 
The Business Office maintains close communications with the City's Finance
Department to ensure the exchange of all financial information on a timely basis. The
Office also coordinates with City auditors and other auditors (i.e., the Massachusetts
Department of Education) to comply with the needs of these auditors. The Office
works closely with the Office of Human Resources on the reconciliation of

Office of Food Services Department
The Office of Food Services is a “self-funding” entity that operates financially
independent from the school district’s budget and does not rely on any district funding to
operate. It relies on revenue solely generated by the department and deposited into its
revolving account as well as the receipt of state and federal funds under the School
Lunch Program. In addition to providing a critical service to the students of the
Framingham Public Schools, it also supports a number of after school snack programs
and food pantries for the greater Framingham school community. The Office has had an
aggressive mission in upgrading the culinary facilities to meet the demands set forth by
the USDA to participate in the National School Lunch Program. With that, there has
been a vast array of projects undertaken during the 2019-2020 school year.

Overview: 
●
●
●
●
● 
Walsh Middle School - Phase II of the kitchen rehab has been
completed, and, consequently, the facility is fully functional with no
concerns. Phase II completion as follows: 
§ New Steamer & Steam Kettle Station
§ New Roof Top Freezer Compressor
§ New 8 Burner Electric Cooktop w/ Double Convection Oven
§ New Serving Line wells
High School - Upgrade
§ New Double Steamer Cooking Battery
§ New Double Deck Pizza Oven
§ New Pizza Rail Station
§ New Hydroponic Farm
Wilson - New Double Steamer Cooking Battery
McCarthy - New Walk-In Refrigerator
Dunning, Potter Road, Hemenway and Stapleton - All wooden
workstations replaced and upgrade to solid stainless steel
Breakfast After the Bell - In addition, the Office of Food Services installed the
Breakfast After the Bell Program. This is a mandated DESE/USDA Program with any
school that has a qualifying population of over 60% for free or reduced school meals. 
We must allow all late arrival students access to breakfast up to the first daily lunch
period. This is happening at two middle schools and four elementary schools. 
Community Eligibility Program (CEP) - This year two schools became full CEP, which
means breakfast and lunch is served at no cost to all students. The two locations in the
district to qualify were Woodrow Wilson and the Thayer Alternative High School. To
become a totally free CEP location the school must have a population that is 60% free
direct certified via the virtual gateway. The Office’s directive is to pursue and grow the
CEP profile of the District. 
Student Employment - The Office continues to expand its student work program in
concert with PSW Youth Careers. With the addition of the hydroponic farm there are
now year-round employment opportunities for students. In the summer of 2019 a total of
11 students were employed working on the production of summer meals and
maintaining Flyer farms and a hydroponic farm. In addition, the hydroponic farm is a
year-round endeavor and students now work the farm during the entire school year. 
56

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Summer Food Service Program - This program, started in 2009, has been delivering
summer breakfast and lunch to children of the community for over 10 years. The
program services roughly 16 sites in the metro-west area with an average of 40,000+ 
meals served each summer. We are in the preliminary stages of looking into the
feasibility of a “Food Truck” to expand the availability of summer food to certain hard to
reach areas of the community. 
Project Forecast for 2020-2021 - With participation levels at all schools at an all-time
high, it is imperative for the department to continue its financial focus on upgrading the
facilities to handle the volume. All of the department initiatives are accomplished without
any supplemental funding from the school district or from the City and prices for lunch
and breakfast will not be increasing for FY21. In the coming year, the additions of
expanded full service cooking batteries are warranted for Brophy, Potter Road, 
Hemenway and the McCarthy schools. The department is installing double convection
steamers, six burner cooktops and expanding the current exhaust hoods and fire
suppression systems. In addition, refrigeration storage needs to be increased and
“walk-ins” need installation starting with Woodrow Wilson. 
Financial - The department has a strong operating profile with the department
maintaining the recommended DESE standard of three months operating funds in their
revolving account. The department served in excess of 1 million reimbursable meals
during the 18-19 school year with a total transaction profile of 1.7 million yearly. The
department is in a full administrative and nutritional audit cycle with the USDA this year; 
as with all previous audits, we expect to meet or exceed all DESE/USDA program
regulations. 
Fully self-funded, the Office of Food Services does not have an impact on the
operating budget. 
Office of Buildings & Grounds
The Office of Buildings and Grounds currently maintains 16 school-owned buildings
comprising of 1,655,076 square feet of building space and 265 acres of grounds, 
including athletic playing fields, paved driveways, walkways, parking lots and wooded
areas. 
The department employs 65 custodians, 11 maintenance personnel, five office support
staff, a maintenance foreman and a director. Department objectives are as follows: 
adhere to safety and health standards, provide cleaning and maintenance inside and 
57
Page 58
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
outside of building structures, ensure security of buildings, plan for and monitor efficient
use of buildings, and provide year-round maintenance of grounds. 
In addition to routine maintenance and cleaning of all buildings, the Office of Buildings
and Grounds oversees and coordinates the following: All applicable federal, state, local
and district inspections including City of Framingham building inspections, fire alarm
inspections and elevator inspections, which are performed annually. 
We are pleased to report we are working with the Massachusetts School Building
Authority (MSBA) in building a new Fuller Middle School with an approximate
occupancy time frame of 2021-2022. We have contracted TBA Architects to perform a
Prefeasibility study for the Hemenway School to determine if it would be more feasible
to renovate or replace the school at its current location or to find another location for a
new Hemenway School. 
The remaining schools have either had significant repairs done or additions added
that have prolonged their useful life. The district has a 20-year Capital Plan for all of 
its schools and we will be guided by that plan as well as by the conditions that exist
or emerge in our buildings. The district has been supported in its efforts to maintain
and upgrade all of our buildings through the City's Capital Budget process. The
Capital Budget for the schools has allowed the district to extend the useful life of our
buildings, as evidenced by the number of schools that are 50 years old or older that
have not been renovated. This year's FY20 Capital Budget request for $3,785,277
has allowed us to continue our efforts to keep our buildings safe, sound and
functional from Security to ADA compliance issues to Exterior Envelope repairs. 
It is important to note that a long-term 20-year capital facilities plan is utilized in
planning for the future needs in the District. For FY21 we will still follow the long
range plan and request funding for Capital projects that require priority status such
as exterior envelope, paving/storm water, HVAC and security that will allow us to
continue to maintain and upgrade our buildings. 
The following is a description of the projects completed in FY20: 
District: Buildings and Grounds maintains a warranty contract with Weatherproofing
Technologies Warranty Renewal Program for FPS facilities and that work is ongoing. 
New classroom furniture was purchased for the addition of a new 5th grade class at King
Elementary School.

Office of Transportation 
The Framingham Public Schools Office of Transportation operates seventy-six school
buses on a daily basis, transporting approximately 6,500 students. The
Transportation system is three-tiered (elementary, middle and high school) with 360
runs covering approximately 3,400 live miles of roadways. The District services
twenty-three schools including public, private and parochial schools per state law. 
Within the public school system, there are 3,000 elementary students, 1,400 middle
school students and 1,300 high school students transported daily. Bus fees collected
in FY19 were $324,542 ($300,000 was budgeted to be used this year) and used to
offset the operating costs in this department. The major cost in this department is the
home to school transportation contract with Durham School Services that will be in
year five of five in FY21. The contract started in 2016. Staffing at the Office of
Transportation consists of a Director, an Assistant Director, two dispatchers, a
secretary and an inter-district mail delivery employee. The fleet consists of 76 buses, 
seven spares with 29 of the 76 buses parked at CSX lot at a cost of $36,833 per year
to the District. The department’s routing software has been upgraded and the cost is
included in this year’s budget. The FY20 upgrades included the Edutracker package, 
which allows parent access to the Edulog Parent Portal Lite to view their child’s bus in
real time. The District’s plan is to implement this portal districtwide so all parents can
view their child’s bus (at the time the budget book was submitted, only Brophy parents
61
Page 62
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
had access). Also included in the upgrade was route data analysis to allow
optimization for scheduling and routing buses. 
For FY21, the contract with Durham School Services will show a 2.50% increase from
FY20. In addition, the District will also request an additional bus due to rising
enrollment. The District will also look to expand late-bus transportation at all our
schools. Currently, the District does provide a minimum of after-school transportation
for our middle schools that are made possible through a combination of District
funding and a grant. In addition, there are three late-runs at the high school at a cost
of approximately $10,000.00. As the District seeks ways to increase access to late-
runs, we will coordinate with the Out-of-School Time Program in order to maximize
the availability of funds both in the operating budget as well as through grant
resources.

Office of Technology
The Office of Technology is responsible for providing a technical foundation to 
support the District's Strategic Plan and maintain an advanced learning environment
for the 21st century student and educator. Our focus is to provide seamless access
to digital resources, to integrate technology into the curriculum of the Framingham
Public School District, and to assist the learning community through efficient 
62
Page 63
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
processes and training. The Office of Technology oversees and supports technology
across 17 sites, supports 1,600 District staff members, 9,000 students, and many of
the community and after-school programs. We provide a wide breadth of support for
technical issues, security and networking, data and analytics, state reporting, digital
curriculum support, and staff professional development. 
For fiscal 2021, the Office of Technology is continuing a move toward the Google for
Education Suite which will be enhanced by the Canvas Learning Management system. 
The focus of the department will be to upgrade many of our older devices and assist
teachers in a migration to a G Suite world. We currently have an inventory of
chromebooks that allows for one device per student. However, many of those devices
are approaching the end of life and need to be replaced over the next 18 months. 
Additionally, the Office of Technology is upgrading existing infrastructure with a new
server farm and updated wireless system. This should increase speed and reliability for
the student and teacher experiences. Lastly, there will be a rollout of a new data
dashboard environment that allows us to more closely and better monitor students in
need of extra support.

Office of Special Education 
Currently there are 2,129 students (1,913 in-district and 216 out-of-district) receiving
special education services, including therapy only, partial inclusion, full inclusion and
substantially separate. In addition to services by special educators, we also provide
speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, adaptive physical
education, orientation and mobility, visual impairment support, applied behavior analyst
support and audiological consultation. The following shows a breakdown of students on
an IEP by subgroups:

The special education position requests for FY21 fall under the umbrella categories of
compliance, preschool growth, and program expansion. 
Below is language cited from 603 CMR 28.00 Special Education Regulations that is
directly aligned to the budget requests below for compliance. 
603 CMR 28.03 (b)(1)(2) 
(b) The school district shall provide facilities and classrooms for eligible students to
maximize the inclusion of such students into the life of the school. 
1. All eligible students shall have access to school facilities including, but not limited
to, those areas necessary to implement the student's IEP. 
2. School districts shall provide whatever equipment and make whatever physical
adaptations are necessary to comply with this provision, including acoustical and
lighting treatments to remove physical communication barriers for students who
are deaf or hard of hearing. 
65
Page 66
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
603 CMR 28.06 (2)(c)(d) 
(c) Least restrictive environment (LRE). The school district shall ensure that, to the
maximum extent appropriate, students with disabilities are educated with students
who do not have disabilities, and that special classes, separate schooling, or other
removal of students with special needs from the general education program
occurs only if the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in
general education classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot
be achieved satisfactorily. 
(d) In-district placement. The placement decision made by the Team shall indicate
the specific program setting in which services will be provided. The Team shall
first consider in-district settings such as a general education classroom, a
resource setting, a separate classroom, a work setting, a vocational school

This year we have had to reach out to agencies to contract out additional services in
Reading and Speech and Language Therapy to maintain compliance with Individual
Education Programs (IEPs). This is a temporary solution and full time positions will need
to be added to maintain current levels of service In addition, this year at the high school, 
general education teachers with dual certification in special education, were asked to
teach sections of special education classes to address the increased level of need in
the students’ IEPs. With an anticipated large freshman class entering next year, 
additional special educators will be needed so that all sections can be offered to our
students with disabilities. 
Our BLOCKS preschool program is growing at a steady pace. We started this year with
130 students with disabilities, ages three to five years old. In 2016, we started the
school year with 76 children. Since September, 2016, four half day sections of our
Autism program have been added, three half day sections of inclusion programs have
been added along with staffing to support those classroom increases. This will be the
third school year in a row where we have added additional classrooms mid-year. This
pattern of growth is not slowing down. In particular, the number of preschool students
requiring specialized programming for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is on the rise. 
We anticipate close to twenty four children entering Kindergarten next year who will
require a specialized ASD classroom. Our current programs are at Dunning Elementary
School (four classrooms total) and King Elementary School (one classroom). In order to
support our incoming students, an additional class will be added at King, which was part
of our long term plan. In addition, we will be starting a third small program at Brophy
Elementary School. The addition of a Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA) is
needed to provide the necessary supervision for ASD programming as the elementary
programs expand. 
Our PreK-5 program for students with intensive multiple disabilities expanded to
Cameron Middle School in SY18. Next year, our current four eighth graders will be
starting at the high school. A further expansion of the program at FHS is part of the
budget request. There are financial benefits to creating internal programming as the
initial cost to start the program is $150,000 less than it would cost to send the students
to out-of-district programming. In addition, it is in the best interest of the children and
families to continue to be a part of our school community. The addition of this
substantially separate classroom at FHS will be the third substantially separate
classroom we have added over the past three years.

The Office of Community Resource Development 
The Office of Community Resource Development (CRD) oversees before school, after
school, non-school days, vacation weeks, and summer programming. Last Spring, we
also launched a continuing education program coined Flyers by Night. Additionally, the
Office oversees over 35 community partnerships working within the schools and
programs. Since 2013, the department has been transitioning to in-house led
programming. Previously, programming was predominantly managed by vendors such
as the YMCA. 
Our Pre-k and Elementary program, called Explorers, is a robust before and after
school program. The program is focused on Project Based Learning integrating STEAM
and Social Emotional Learning. The overall model is designed through a variety of clubs
such as ImagArena, Mindfulness, Coding, Cooking, and more. Explorers is a fee-based
program, accepting vouchers and scholarships.

Our Middle School program, rebranded just this year, is called Flyers After School. 
Flyers After School (FAS) runs three ten week cycles at Cameron, Fuller and Walsh
Middle Schools. Students and families select weekly clubs to participate in after the bell
rings. With an emphasis on project-based learning and developing social and emotional
skills and competencies, FAS offers a wide variety of activities including: Arts, Academic
support, Middle School Sports Clubs, and STEM activities. FAS offers snacks, late
transportation and is free for families. 
At the High School level, students sign up independently for a variety of clubs offered
after school such as Year Book, Robotics, Poetry and Literacy, Debate, Student
Immigration Movement, Environmental Awareness and more. During the summer, CRD
oversees The Summer Institute, formerly known as Summer School at Framingham
High School. This fee-based program runs a month-long and offers two types of classes
for high school students: 
Credit Recovery: This provides students with additional time and support to complete
assignments and/or time missed. Completing this summer class allows students to
avoid failing and needing to repeat a class the following school year. 
Original Credit Classes: Framingham High School students and families are able to
enroll in classes that earn actual credit towards graduation.

The vision of Out of School Time expansion is to grow access and equity for students
beyond the bell. Nationally, out of school time programs are shown to have efficacy
with student attendance, discipline, family engagement and more. The programs work
tirelessly to ensure student accommodations for all behaviors by connecting with the
school day staff, families, and community partners. As a department, we are projected
to service approximately 2,800 students just this year. 
CRD additionally facilitates many community partnerships for the District and schools. 
Our partners range from higher education institutions, municipal offices, corporate
sponsors, and community non-profits. CRD leverages fees collected, grants and
community partnerships to provide equity and access for all students. However, there
are many additional costs, such as administration, transportation, and custodians that
are often not covered by grants and sponsors. These expenses at bare minimum
must be covered by the district in order to establish a foundation to expand programs
and exhibit the District’s commitment to OST programming. We are proud of the work
we accomplish every day and are excited to see the department continue to grow and
meet the needs of families.

Office of Adult ESL
As it enters its 36th year, Framingham Adult ESL Plus (FAESL+) is stronger than ever. 
With over 800 students enrolled, we are one of the largest publicly-funded adult English
as a Second Language (ESL) programs in the state. The majority of our funding comes
from state and federal grants, supplemented by an active fundraising arm. However, the
demand for services is still tremendous: at our last registration, we had 100 open
spaces and almost a thousand prospective students showed up. As mentioned above, 
the waitlist for classes is almost as large as our current student enrollment, so we are
continually looking for more funding to add more classes. We’re holding our 21st annual
MetroWest ESL Fund gala on Wednesday March 13th at the Sheraton Tara. 
FAESL+ continues to provide part-time English, High School Equivalency, Job Skills, 
and Citizenship preparation classes at no charge to area residents. We also provide our
students with access to as many wraparound services as possible. For example, this
year we are again able to provide our students with free consultations with an
immigration attorney, thanks to Massa Viana Law. We have begun providing on-site
counseling with licensed bilingual mental health professionals, thanks to a grant from
MetroWest Health Foundation. We have an advisor regularly staffing the MassHire
Metro Southwest Career Center to help bring adult education and Career Services inline
in this region. We also received a grant from First Literacy to work on a curriculum that
helps immigrant parents be savvier about the social media environment in which their
kids are growing. When finished, we look forward to sharing it with our community
partners. Also, we are expanding our reach to do more workplace education programs
in partnership with English for New Bostonians and the Workforce Education Training
Fund. 
Our program maintains a vital online presence, particularly in the immigrant community. 
We have over 3,500 likes on our Facebook page where we share information about
English classes, services in our area, and other information, like the new Hands-Free
Driving Law. We also regularly host local agencies and service providers who are trying
to reach out to the immigrant community. Groups like WIC, Comcast Internet Essentials, 
and the US Census Bureau have recently talked to staff and students about services
they offer. 
The impact of FAESL+ extends far beyond the 800 students who attend our classes. 
Hundreds of our students have children in Framingham Public Schools, and our
teachers and students have experience helping students navigate systems so that their
72
Page 73
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
whole families can succeed. FAESL+, along with the United Way of Tri-County, 
convenes Framingham Community Partners, pulling together dozens of local social
service agencies on topics of interest and creating a valuable Network opportunity. The
program also helps at a state level, with members of its administrative team sitting on
the MassHire MSW Board, ABE Director's Council, and providing PD through the
SABES Network. We have also been key partners in a research study with the Harvard
Center for Education Policy Research on the public benefit of publicly-funded adult
education. The early results are quite promising, and we look forward to having a final
report share. 
We thank Framingham Public Schools for all of the support they provide our program
and, in turn, to our students.

Physical Education Department
The Physical Education Department's goal is to educate minds, develop healthy
bodies, promote positive attitudes towards fitness, physical activity and sports
skills. The Department has developed a Peer Observation matrix that has been
vetted by the Office of Teaching and Learning, which allows everyone in the
department one professional day to visit and observe colleagues in other buildings. 
The department recently completed an update of the K-5 PE curriculum and is 
73
Page 74
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
working on reorganizing and rewriting the grade 6-8 PE and health curriculums. 
The Physical Education Department has made significant strides and will continue
to do so through this coming school year. The Department, through collaboration
with the Business, has streamlined the supply ordering process, learned and
implemented Munis, and has established a basis of needs in terms of supplies and
programming for K-8. 
It was exciting to regain control of the Health and PE budgets. There was a slight
learning curve involved, but after working with the Business Office and learning
Munis, supply ordering became even more efficient and streamlined. Also, this past
year has been helpful in establishing a basis of need, in terms of supplies and
programming, for the K-8 department. This assessment will be an ongoing process. 
The Health and PE Department continues to operate in three tiers, elementary, 
middle, and high school. Grades K-8 is overseen by a Department Head and
grades 9-12 is overseen by another Department Head however, we consider
ourselves a K-12 department. Our vision remains the same, expose students to as
many opportunities as possible, provide students with important health and fitness
knowledge, and foster a positive culture within our classes that teaches life skills
and perseverance. 
Budgetarily, it has been a pleasure working with everyone in the Business Office, 
and we feel fully supported. The purchasing process has been much easier the
second year going through the process. It is very helpful to have control of the
supply budget specifically. As needs arise throughout the school year, they can be
addressed fairly quickly. In regards to PD, it has been somewhat of a challenge to
plan and access certain professional development opportunities based on two
factors. First, the fact that most of the full day PD days were scheduled in the fall
(2019), lining up and planning days so close together was challenging. Secondly
and separately, the district policy that disallows teachers to access PD
opportunities on Mondays and Fridays severely limits the Health and PE
department, as there are limited PD opportunities to begin with and many PD’s for
Health and PE teachers fall on Mondays and Fridays. The hope is that policy can
be changed as subs become more readily available to the district. 
Scheduling and staffing are a huge focus and constant concern. At the elementary
level, working in conjunction with the Office of Teaching and Learning and Assistant
Superintendent Amy Bright, scheduling changes were implemented. The intent
was to create an equitable schedule across all nine elementary schools. This year
was considered a pilot year. An SEL (social emotional learning) block was added 
74
Page 75
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
to allow schools to pinpoint specific needs of higher risk students and provide
targeted support during these SEL blocks. 
As a result of the schedule changes, at this point, there are no itinerant teachers
(teaching at more than one school).  At the middle school level, scheduling is
consistent across all three schools. An additional enrichment/connections/advisory
block was added in the morning to each schedule. The challenge in regards to
scheduling at both the elementary and middle school levels is equity in teaching
load and class size across all schools. It is a consistent goal of the department to
attract and retain quality teachers. The record will show, over the past five years, 
we have been successful in achieving this goal. 
A Health and PE Website has been added to the Department list on the
Framingham District Homepage. Inter-departmental collaboration has been a goal
of the department for many years. In the Fall, in collaboration with Sarah DeLuca, 
Stacey Cugini, Mynette Shifman, Cheryl Aglio-Girelli, and the Office of Health and
Wellness, many Health and PE staff had the opportunity to attend a full day
mindfulness professional development at Open Spirit in Framingham. Also, a
partnership with the Food Services department has been developed, where Middle
School Health classes have had Framingham State interns, who are overseen by
Raquel Hammond, present tastings to 6th grade students at all three middle
schools during the nutrition unit. At the same time, the Food Services “Harvest of
the Month '' program is being promoted through the tasting presentations. The two
departments are working together to enhance the experience for all involved. We
are excited to continue this partnership, and we are exploring opportunities to
expand the relationship. 
The purchase of 30 Polar GoFit OH1 Heart rate monitors has been approved and
will be piloted at some schools (yet to be determined). It is a distinct possibility that
more units will be purchased in the future. The Office of Technology has agreed to
provide a compatible IPhone to aid in the facilitation of the Polar GoFit pilot. 
Going forward the goal of the department is to continue to build positive
relationships with students and continue to help build our students into responsible, 
accountable, young adults. We also will continue our goal and vision of remaining
a unified K-12 department. As department heads, we plan to continue our
collaboration with other district departments, in a variety of initiatives and collective
interests. Two goals going forward include continued refinement and work with the
Office of Teaching and Learning to ensure that any inequities and inconsistencies
within the elementary, middle, and high school schedules are addressed and 
75
Page 76
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
improved upon. Also, in conjunction with this goal, class sizes (ever growing) are
carefully monitored and assessed to ensure the best possible experience for all
students at each school. Departmentally, for K-8, a goal moving forward is to find a
way to have meaningful departmental meeting time implemented throughout the
school year, other than full day PD days. Without departmental meetings
throughout the year, it is difficult to ensure that certain messages are being heard
and understood at all schools. Also, finding meaningful and engaging professional
development opportunities is always a goal of the department heads. We look
forward to the future and continue to put our collective best foot forward.

Athletics Department
Framingham Athletic Department is a continued source of pride for the people of the
City of Framingham. Because of the volume of events and publicity we receive, 
athletics is often considered the most publicly recognized department in the school
district. We are determined to provide our student athletes with a great experience
representing the City. Our athletic teams reflect the positive values they have learned
growing up in Framingham. Our athletes represent us with poise, class, and
distinction throughout the school year. Our teams reflect the richness of diversity in
Framingham and our athletes become better people with guidance from our teacher
coaches. For many of our students, athletics is the central factor in better attendance, 
76
Page 77
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
improved behavior, higher grades, and greater overall participation in their school
community. Framingham is a well-recognized sports community, and many of our
teams are recognized as perennial challengers for league and state wide
accomplishments. The Department has four full time employees that manage and
support roughly 150 part time coaches and roughly 1500 athletes. Athletics works in
close coordination with all other departments in the City of Framingham. Your
Framingham Athletic Department has an excellent reputation both within the City and
throughout the state. 
This past year our student athletes had many great accomplishments with the Boys
Soccer winning a League Title, Boys Ice Hockey winning a League Title, Girls
Basketball showing tremendous improvement, Gymnastics being undefeated and
winning a League Title, Football making its first playoff appearance in 20 years, 
tremendous improvement in our Track athletes, countless new school records in both
Girls and Boys Swim and Dive along with a regular season League Title for the Boys
team, State Championships for both our Cheer and Dance teams, and too many
individual accolades to mention. This past year we hosted the MIAA State Dance
Championships, a Sectional Wrestling Tournament, the Bay State Conference Winter
Cheer and Dance Competition, and many other exciting events throughout the year. 
Our vision moving forward is to continually improve and foster a positive culture
within all of our programs projecting a positive image of our teams for the citizens of
Framingham. We continue to work closely with our youth sports groups to create
strong feeder programs that will keep our most talented young people wanting to play
their sport at Framingham High School. We are working to enhance our current
facilities and create awareness throughout the City for our needs such as additional
turf fields, gym space, or a community athletic center.

Sage Department
The SAGE Department is composed of students in the 2nd-8th grades who have
qualified through various screening measures. The Sage department has 9 staff
members that service nine elementary schools and three middle schools. In grades 2-5, 
students go to pull-out classes once a week for 1 1/2 hours and work on activities and
projects that include STEM, ELA, and social studies. Students also benefit from the
SAGE teacher pushing into the regular classroom to offer enrichment or other activities. 
Our middle school students have pull-out classes to work on projects or enrichment for
subjects such as math and ELA. They also benefit from having the SAGE teachers
pushing into their math, science, and ELA classes. 
This year in SAGE we did a lot of awesome things, and as a team we stretched our
minds and challenged our students. We have started an innovation project with all of
our students, to make our schools and the City of Framingham greener. Each school 
78
Page 79
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
has chosen projects that their SAGE students are interested in with the emphasis on
“going green.” At the start of this project, the SAGE students at each of our elementary
schools wrote letters to Mayor Spicer, Representative Robinson, and Mr. Shawn Luz
and asked them what they think the biggest environmental need is in Framingham. 
From this we will be doing projects to find solutions to some of these problems. We are
also purchasing robot kits for each elementary school so that they can use the robots to
help solve these problems as well as get the students interested in robotics. Working
with the robots will also develop the skills needed for robotics in middle and high school. 
We are also starting a new screening process to be able to identify a larger
demographic of students. Starting this spring, we will be doing online testing using the
CogAT cognitive test. Not only will this program be less biased, it will take our testing
time from 2-3 months to 24 hours. We will also be able to test an entire class of
students at the same time. Our teachers are receiving PD hours for training on how to
administer the test. We sent out a SAGE newsletter to the entire community that will be
published three times a year. We also had a Puzzle Night on January 29th to celebrate
National Puzzle Day for the community and had well over 200 people. This will become
an annual event. For the coming year we are going to be doing universal screening for
all 1st grade students in the district. By doing this we can reach students that may never 
be identified using the previous tests. We would also like to be able to add more robots
and other STEM related materials so that our students can get a firm grasp of robotics
and STEM in general.

Office of Fine and Performing Arts 
The Fine and Performing Arts in the Framingham Public Schools is a jewel in the
crown of our educational programming for our kids. Framingham has shown that it
values the arts as a part of a comprehensive education. Our theatre program, our
instrumental music program, our brand new dance program and our visual arts
programs are some of the best in the state. The theatre program is used as an
exemplar in other communities. 
The request this year shows an increase in our operating budget and a request to add
to our additional salaries along with much needed increases in staffing for electives at
FHS. In a continued effort to provide equity in supplies, materials and curriculum this
increase includes the subscription cost for three of our elementary schools for Quaver 
81

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Music. Quaver is an online music curriculum resource which is the foundation of our
K-5 curriculum. This subscription and the accompanying technology ensure that all
students in the district are receiving the same high quality music experience. The
increase in the budget includes these renewals. The increase also includes a request
for an additional art teacher at FHS, an Assistant Director of Fine and Performing Arts
at Central office and additional funding to support our highly successful marching
band which continues to grow and now rehearses throughout the school year. 
Highlights: 
● Equitable per student formula for elementary and middle school arts
funding has provided a “like” arts experience for all students in
Framingham. 
● As a result of cost center ordering we have saved between 30% and 50% 
in discounts from at least two of our biggest vendors. This savings
allowed us to outfit every music classroom with “standard “ equipment and
to provide art supplies at a per student allowance which insured equity at
all schools and relieved the PTO’s from supporting curriculum related
materials. 
● The String program is now at three elementary schools and 30 string
instruments were purchased to start this program. We now need at least
30 additional instruments as the program grows. 
● 750 grade four students will attend the Boston Symphony Orchestra in
March 2020. 
● Our dance program at Framingham High School is overenrolled after just
one year. We have added two more classes to help fulfill requests from
our newcomers. 
● An FHS student was selected for the Massachusetts Music Educators
Association all state festival once again. 
● An FHS student came in 2nd place in the state wide Massachusetts
Educational Theatre Guild’s monologue scholarship audition. 
● Our Visual Arts students participated in Youth Art Month and the Globe
Scholastic and were recognized with gold and silver keys in Photography
and Visual Art. 
● Drums Alive was introduced into three of our elementary schools as a part
of our music/SEL initiative. We hope to add it to our three Middle Schools
in the fall of 2020. 
● Our grade five band program serves 70% of all grade five students in the
district. 
● Our three middle schools and our high school have vibrant and successful
after school theatre programs.

● In conjunction with Community Resource and Development, we will offer
our third year of summer theatre programming for our students. The

Leadership Opportunities
● ECAF Leadership Council - Parents, community organization representatives, 
and early childhood educators meet to discuss program initiatives and set the
direction for ECAF activities. 
● Action Team Involvement – Members participate in defining tasks for specific
program activities such as community outreach, volunteer recruitment, 
marketing, and fundraising. 
The work is led by Jane Cohen DeHaven, the ECAF Program Coordinator. All positions
are funded by the Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care Coordinated
Family and Community Engagement grant program, administered by the Framingham
Public Schools, and kindly supported by community partners. As the district looks to
expand access to early education, ECAF offers the perfect foundation to build off of. In
FY20, Joseph Corazzini, Assistant Superintendent of Equity, Diversity and Community
Development, requested that ECAF be established as a department. The department
would provide support to help expand our Pre-K work. A modest first budget of
$10,041.00 to cover some supplies is the first step in our effort to expand our Pre-K
work. We are delighted to be an official department and part of the Framingham Public
Schools

Library Media Department
Mission: The mission of the FPS Libraries is to provide equitable resources and
opportunities to all members of the FPS community by supporting learners in their
journey toward their unique passions, becoming critically thinking, responsible and
literate citizens in order to meet the information needs of their life and work. 
Goals: The FPS Libraries will modernize the print and digital library collections across
the district in order to provide equitable access to all students, support content area
instruction, nurture a culture of independent reading, build a program that ensures every
student attains the Massachusetts Digital Literacy Standards essential for college and
career readiness, and build a library culture of independent, student-led inquiry. 
Highlights
● Circulated 139,515 books to FPS’s students and staff, in the school year 2018-
2019. 
● Purchased approximately 3,200 new books. 
● Created a Visiting Young Adult Author series for middle and high school
students, coordinated with their summer reading choices, in collaboration with
FPS Office of Community Resource Development, Framingham State University
and Framingham Public Library. Award-winning author “alumni” includes Matt de

la Pena (2018), A. S. King (2019), and Elly Swartz (2019).  2020 author speaker: 
Nic Stone. 
● Increased print materials in languages other than English; they are now available
in every FPS Library, primarily in Spanish and Portuguese, with a dedicated
budget line to fund the growth of these collections. High circulation in these
collections demonstrates a strong need to supply this increasing demand. 
● Implemented the “Write to an Author” initiative in the elementary libraries, in
collaboration with the Framingham Public Library for National Author Month, 
November 2019. 
● Expanded the Digital Literacy Skills curriculum in the elementary libraries, 
including units in Media Balance, Online Safety, Digital Research Skills, and
Coding. 
● Formalized InterLibrary Loan program allowing any student or staff member to
borrow resources from any FPS Library
Curriculum and Teaching 
Education in Information and Digital Literacy has been a growing need across the
nation. Massachusetts responded in 2016 by creating the Digital Literacy and
Computer Science Frameworks, which are new for all Massachusetts Public
Schools. The Digital Literacy Standards introduction explains that “meaningful
participation in modern society requires fluency in the uses and impact of
technology for living, learning, and working. People need to be able to apply
knowledge, skills, and dispositions central to digital literacy and computer
science to their chosen interests and career fields. They must become
computational thinkers so they can create, apply, or change existing computer
hardware, software, and devices to meet the computing and information needs of
their life and work” (2016 Massachusetts Digital Literacy and Computer Science
(DLCS) Curriculum Framework).  These skills largely overlap with the kind of
Information Literacy skills that have long been the staple of Library Media
Specialists’ curriculum and teaching. The district has made great strides toward
building a program that ensures every student masters the Digital Literacy and
Computer Science skills essential for college and career readiness. However, 
there is work yet to be done, as the Library Media Department, having only
recently been rebuilt, does not yet have a standardized Curriculum across the
district’s schools, and does not have adequate staffing to ensure the
implementation of these standards with fidelity. 
The Library Media Specialists at the elementary schools have fixed schedules. They
develop and deliver lessons based on the MSLA (Massachusetts School Library
Association) Literacy standards, The ALA (American Library Association) standards, 
89
Page 90
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
and the Massachusetts State Digital Literacy frameworks, with whole group, small
group, and check out time. An additional priority is integrating content from other subject
areas into library lessons. The middle and high school Library Media Specialists work
on a flexible schedule. They collaborate with teachers to develop and deliver lessons
across subject areas. Library Media Specialists teach research skills, technology
applications, digital literacy, and fair and ethical use of materials. Teaching consists of
large group, small group, and individual instruction. Library Media Specialists at the
middle schools assist school literacy programs and remediation efforts by teaching
small group classes during designated times. 
Areas of Need / Budget Requests
Collection Development:  FPS Libraries must invest in contemporary, diverse and
curriculum-supporting print and digital resources to update their collections and to
maintain 21st century classrooms and curricula with appropriate hardware and digital
resources. The print collections in the majority of the district’s libraries are out of date
and continued investment is needed to build current collections tied to curriculum and
community interests. The increasing need for print and digital materials in languages
other than English (primarily Spanish and Portuguese) also requires additional
resources. It is the ongoing work of the Library Media Specialists to continually assess
each school’s collection, identify needs, collaborate with instructional leaders and
teachers to determine additional requests in alignment with curriculum and make
purchases accordingly. 
The students and faculty at the schools that are staffed by certified Library Media
Specialists have access to the extensive digital resources provided for free by the State
of Massachusetts, which would cost around $40,000.00 per year if schools were to
purchase them on their own. These resources include full-text articles, videos and
primary source documents from magazines, newspapers, reference works and
academic journals. In SY 2018-2019, FPS students and staff read 136,190 articles on
school-based databases. 
Professional Development: In order to adequately maintain library collections, deliver
digital and information literacy content, and mentor independent inquiry among K-12
students in Framingham Public Schools, Library Media Specialists require access to
resources for Professional Development. Through our membership in the
Massachusetts School Library Association (MSLA), access to professional journals, and
attendance at conferences, we are able to stay on top of current issues and trends, and
identify areas of focus for our own professional development.

Office of Media and Communications
The Media and Communications Office provides families, staff, and the wider
Framingham community with transparent, helpful, inspiring, timely, and relevant
information. This is in the form of District-to-home messaging, public-facing
communication channels such as the Framingham Public Schools website and social
media accounts, media relations, as well as, providing communications-related training
opportunities for Teachers, Administration, and Staff. 
In addition to supporting every department and school within Framingham Public
Schools with planned and real-time communication requests, the Media and
Communications Manager also seeks to pursue their own initiatives as it relates to
adopting modern tools, managing the District’s presence and reputation, increasing
video content, building partnerships within the City, and showing thought-leadership
beyond our District boundaries. 
There are necessary learning opportunities both sought and provided from the
Communications Office. Opportunities to grow our knowledge base, expand into new
capabilities, connect with other K-12 Communications professionals, and engage in
communications-related conversations are paramount to ensuring that the Framingham
Public School District is not living in a vacuum, but supporting, cultivating, and, in some
91

cases, leading the charge for surrounding Districts. One-on-one support, PD for
Secretaries, Teachers, and Administrators, and group training sessions have been
provided as it relates to social media, website maintenance, and Blackboard Connect
Ed. 
The office and team of one has many documented accomplishments since March of
2019. Some of these notable items include: 
● Continued improvement in branding and user experience for public-facing
Framingham Public Schools content. 
● Significantly increased fan/follower growth across all social media channels: 42% 
Twitter, 49% on Facebook, 92% on Instagram.

Sensory-friendly performance of Disney’s Frozen, Jr.).
● Launched several opportunities to increase two-way communication and
stakeholder feedback on topics like the 2020-2021 Calendar, Homework Policy, 
Staff Communication Preferences, as well as, incorporated feedback gathered
via email and social media. 
● Revamped and digitized the Distribution of Material process, as well as, the Back
to School Kit to ensure accessibility for our stakeholders. 
● Currently hosting one unpaid FSU student intern to assist with project-based

Framingham High School
Advances in academic opportunities are abundant at Framingham High School. We
have partnered with several organizations to advance learning opportunities for our
students: 
● The Learning Center for the Deaf/Framingham High School: American
Sign Language course
● Framingham State University/Framingham High School: College Algebra, 
Quantitative Reasoning
● Framingham State University/Framingham High School: Metrowest Early

investigating a topic of their choosing. 
● Research and discussion on a new schedule that will include a Flyer Flex
period. All students would select an academic or interest workshop. The
goal of the Flyer Flex period is to engage all members of our school in a 
95

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
wide range of learning opportunities while bolstering academic/personal
achievement and advancing school culture. 
During the 2019-2020 academic year, teachers in math, history, and school counseling
worked with Framingham State and Mass Bay professors to vet courses in these
disciplines so that students will have an opportunity to earn both high school and
college credit during the school day. Staff members from the Metrowest College
Planning Center at FSU and Mass Bay launched a satellite office in the FHS library to
support students in the new Metrowest Early Scholars Program and 100 Males to
College. ESL teachers and administrators welcomed families to the first FHS ESL
parent night at Woodrow Wilson. This was an opportunity for ESL parents to hear from
teachers and administrators and ask questions about instruction and school operations. 
Our school community is changing. Our hopes and goals are to create academic and
social and emotional learning programming that meets the needs of all our students; 
such programming includes: 
● Create and staff a Welcome to Framingham High School Program. This program
would give all transfer students the academic and social/emotional/behavioral
support that will set them on a path of success after moving to Framingham and
enrolling in a large urban high school. 
● Create alternative pathways for students to earn a high school diploma including
different credit requirements to earn a diploma. 
● Implement a schedule that includes a Flyer Flex period. All students will select an
academic or interest workshop during every Flyer Flex period. The goal of the
Flyer Flex period is to engage all members of our school in a wide range of
learning opportunities throughout the school year. 
● Plan and execute NEASC 2020 Decennial Accreditation visit in November 2020
● Develop a plan to increase building supervision through duty periods and
campus supervision. 
● Increase support and interventions for freshman before, during and after the
transition to high school. 
Originally constructed in 1961 the Framingham North High School shared two wings
of the building named the Winch Park Secondary School. In 1992 one single
Framingham High School was created combining two high schools into one. The
district moved the South High School students and faculty from Flagg Drive into the
North High School at 115 A Street. Then in 2001 and through 2007, a major
renovation and construction project was undertaken. Additions to the building added a
library, science wings and a mechanical room to the existing structure. The project
ran over a year beyond the original completion date. The original contractor filed for 
96
Page 97
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
bankruptcy and an insurance bonding company had to complete the last 5% of the
construction project. As a result, As-built drawings and some equipment start-up data
was not provided to the district as per job specifications. 
The building contains 396,000 square feet of space and is situated on 44.35 acres of
land. The grounds contain a synthetic football/soccer field, a field hockey field, a
tennis court, and multiple ball fields at the front of the school that is owned and
maintained by the Parks and Recreation Department. The parking lot houses over
350 vehicle parking-stalls. The building was designed on multiple levels with a two-
story spread footprint and three enclosed courtyards. There are two elevators that
comply with ADA, fire and building code requirements. Framingham High School has
90 full classrooms. The building is equipped with two separate boiler rooms, two
generator rooms and multiple mechanical rooms. Dual fuel gas fired boilers and
water heaters, diesel fired generators and #2 oil stored in an underground tank for
firing boilers on oil in an emergency situation. Roof to air handlers and cooling
provide cooling for half of the building. The other half is piped and has the ability to be
expanded with cooling if a chiller and cooling tower is installed. The parking lot has
been expanded and sixty-five vehicle parking stalls have been added. The building is
in good general condition, keeping in mind that the structure is 57 years of age. 
Framingham High School is listed as a qualified Massachusetts Emergency
Management Agency (MEMA) shelter because underground fuel storage tanks
provide for an independent fuel source for the back- up generators and boilers.

Thayer High School
Thayer has focused on how to continue to move students forward in accomplishing their
goals and has been under new leadership this year. We have worked with the office of
Equity, Diversity, and Community Development to bring speakers and outside resources
to the students of Thayer, and have worked with other community agencies to bring a
Financial Literacy workshop series to students who will graduate soon. We have also
worked with the Social Emotional and Mental Health district team to discuss challenges
in the classroom through observation and discussion. In conjunction with the
Department of Health and Wellness and the Director of Safety and Security, teachers
have been provided training, such as ALICE, Epi-Pen, and Trauma Informed Teaching
training. We would like to continue the conversation on other outside support’s that may
benefit students at Thayer. Next year, we hope to provide students with increased
options in transportation, targeted and regular MCAS tutoring, and more support for ELL
and special education students whose needs are not currently being met. 
Currently used as an alternative high school, the Eugene Thayer Campus was originally
constructed in 1905 and was named the Lawrence Street Elementary School. Besides
housing an elementary school, the building has seen many uses over its 115-year life. It
was home to school administration offices, youth coordination office, and from 1982
through 1994 the Visiting Nurses Association leased the building from the school
department. In 1995 it became home to the alternative high school. 
Located at 50 Lawrence Street, the building contains 10,800 square feet of space
and is situated on roughly 2 acres of land. The grounds contain a parking lot that
houses 44 vehicle-parking stalls but is in need of repair and resurfacing. 
The building was designed with two stories and a basement that houses the
mechanical and boiler room. The building has five classrooms. There is a handicap
chair lift that provides access to all levels in accordance with ADA requirements. The
heating system was converted from oil to natural gas. A new boiler and gas burner
were installed in 2005. There is no emergency backup generator in the building. The
office and classrooms are cooled via portable wall cooling units. 
The exterior of the building was upgraded with roof repairs, new windows, new trim, 
gutters downspouts and minor landscaping as a capital improvement in 2008. The
roof is slate tiles. The building is in fair condition. There are no major upgrades
planned at this time.

Cameron Middle School 
The faculty and the administration of Cameron Middle School have been focused this
year on working on the goals developed with the support of Anne Ludes in our Tier 1
support plan. So far this year, we have increased our classroom visit rounds (CVR) so
that we are visiting all content teacher classrooms each week. Our Instructional
Leadership Team analyzes the data from these visits to find themes where we can
provide professional development or teacher support for our staff. We have increased
student time on the iReady platform as well as increased iReady lesson pass rates for
both ELA and Math. We have worked closely with our Tier 2 team to reduce the number
of major referrals and develop interventions to support students in the classroom. We
have monitored student attendance each month and the support staff is working closely
with families and students to decrease chronic absenteeism. As a school we continue to
focus on Universal Design for Learning practices, which focuses on creating access to
engaging and rigorous grade-level content for all students by eliminating barriers that
may impede access to the curriculum. Our Universal Design for Learning team
provides professional development for all staff once a month. 
For the 2020 - 2021 school year, we have requested an additional ESL teacher and 0.2
ELD coach due to the increased enrollment of our English Language Learners
population. We have also requested two additional grade 7 teachers and two additional
99
Page 100
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
grade 8 teachers due to increased enrollment. The final position we have requested is
one special education teacher to meet the increased needs of our special education
population. With the increase in enrollment we need additional teachers to meet the
individual needs of all our students. Our staff and administration will continue to work on
the goals in our Tier 1 support plan. This includes our focus on Classroom Visit Rounds, 
chronic absenteeism, and major discipline referrals. Additionally, we will work closely
with the support staff to write social emotional learning lesson plans to teach to students
during our adviser groups. Our Tier 2 team will continue to meet weekly to review
student concerns and place students in appropriate Tier 2 interventions. Through our
continued Universal Design for Learning professional development we will offer
guidance to our staff in implementing UDL strategies in all classrooms. 
The original Cameron Middle School was constructed in 1973 and was one of three
school buildings built over a three year time period using a replicated design. Major
reconstruction replacing over 80% of the existing structure took place and was
completed in 2000. At the time of completion Cameron School was considered to be
"state of the art" in design, technology and furnishings and continues to be a jewel of the
community today. Located at 215 Elm Street, the building contains 114,000 square feet
and is situated on 30.75 acres of land. The grounds contain a baseball field, a football
field and a soccer field. There is no playground on site. The parking lot houses 88
vehicle-parking stalls. 
The building was designed with a two-story classroom and administration wing and a
renovated gymnasium wing along with a new cafe and auditorium. There is one elevator
that complies with current ADA access, building and fire code requirements. Cameron
has 33 full classrooms. The heating plant is natural gas fired with air handlers that
supply a VAV, or variable air volume system and supplemental hydronic perimeter heat. 
The cooling system is a centrifugal chiller equipped with an exterior water-cooling tower. 
Although the heating and cooling systems provide for efficient climate control, they are
costly to operate especially during the peak, or summer cooling season. 
The building is equipped with an emergency backup generator, an acid neutralization
plant that provides treatment for lab waste when required by science labs and a duplex
sewage ejector system. The building is in very good general condition with all
mechanical systems and general architectural furnishings in excellent condition.

Fuller Middle School
The faculty and the administration of Fuller Middle School have been focused this year
on reaching and exceeding the benchmarks laid out in our Turnaround Plan. So far this
year, we have created a common template that is used during all departmental and
team meetings; this has allowed the school to set common protocols and norms that are
followed during all meetings, which has led to increased productivity and efficacy. We
have created an infrastructure to support and maximize teachers’ Collaborative Team
Time, which has allowed teachers to have dedicated time to focus on analyzing student
data, co-planning, participating in Professional Learning Communities, and meeting with
the school’s guidance counselors on a consistent schedule. We have also focused our
professional development on strengthening our UDL (Universal Design for Learning) 
practices, which focuses on creating access to engaging and rigorous grade-level
content for all students by eliminating barriers that may impede access to the
curriculum. 
One of our goals for next year is to expand the work of our Student Support team by
adding a new guidance counselor. With three guidance counselors and a full-time
Student Success Coach in the building, we will be able to allocate time for our students
to begin educational planning in 6th grade, and we will be able to expand our Social and
Emotional Learning support classes for students. Since Fuller houses the Portuguese
and Spanish TBE (Transitional Bilingual Education) programs and currently over a third
101
Page 102
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
of our students are ELLs (English Language Learners), we are hoping to add a full-time
SEI (Sheltered English Instruction) coach in order to provide support in best SEI
practices to all of the faculty. Next year Fuller will also be adding King Elementary as a
feeder school; we will need to add an additional social studies teacher to our 6th grade
to accommodate the new students that we are expecting. 
Constructed in 1958 as the Framingham High School, the building is currently used
as Fuller Middle School. In addition, the Buildings and Grounds Department houses
its operations and storage for vehicles and equipment occupying approximately
15,000 square feet of building space. There are several offices that occupy additional
space such as the Adult ESL program (3,600 square feet) and the Parent Information
Center (3,000 square feet).
Located at 31 Flagg Drive, the building contains 196,000 square feet and is situated on
over 30 acres of combined property along with the Farley Middle School, currently
occupied by the Massachusetts Bay Community College. Also shared with the college
are the football/soccer fields as well as the baseball field and the adjoining parking area. 
There is no playground on site. The Fuller School has roughly 150 parking stalls
available for all of its occupants. The building was designed on one level with four
classroom wings and two closed courtyards. Fuller has the capacity for over 50 full
classrooms. The building was originally equipped with many skylights that were
removed during roof replacement resulting in limited natural light throughout the main
corridors. The heating system was converted from oil to natural gas and new boilers
and gas burners were installed in 2005. The building is not equipped with central
cooling. There are several window units or split cooling systems in the administrative
offices. The building is not equipped with an emergency backup generator. The current
structure of the building is concrete masonry units with a gypsum deck roof; however, 
neither the roof nor the walls have any insulation and both are vulnerable to infiltration
of water. The building was constructed on structural piles and caissons with a crawl
space and a dirt floor beneath the entire building. This causes a musty odor at times
within the building. Air quality testing was performed in 2007 when mold spore count, 
carbon dioxide, oxygen and carbon monoxide measured levels were reported to be
within allowable limits. The structural concrete floor is suspended and is showing signs
of wear. Some recent upgrades include: auditorium stage curtains and lighting; a new
auditorium ceiling; a new handicap access ramp and an exterior brick wall replacement
on the north face or rear of the building. The building is in poor condition and the roof is
at the end of its useful life. The building also has structural issues where temporary
shoring has been installed. 
102

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
While the Fuller building has reached the end of its useful life, it remains safe for
student occupancy and the district is closely monitoring the building to ensure that it
continues to be safe for occupancy. Indoor air quality is always monitored, especially in
those areas that have visible signs of water infiltration or other signs of deterioration. If
an area of concern is identified, the district will relocate students and staff until the
problem has been addressed. In 2015, the roof over the main classroom wing of the
building (approximately 30% of the school's entire roof surface) was repaired by the
manufacturer to extend its life expectancy until construction of the new building is
completed. 
Furthermore, the district engaged a structural engineer to determine the integrity of the
building's foundation and flooring. As a result, the district installed temporary structural
supports in identified areas in 2016, primarily in the maintenance services garage where
vehicles are stored. All of the building's mechanical systems are monitored, and the air
handling system that ventilates the building has been set to run for extended periods of
time to ensure the air in the building is satisfactory at all times. Many of these conditions
have existed for some time at the Fuller building, and the district has responded
appropriately to these challenges and will continue to do so as needed. Based on our
experience and ongoing efforts, we are confident we can continue to maintain the Fuller
building in a safe and secure manner during the construction of the new Fuller School
that is currently underway and until the new building is constructed and set to open
before the 2021 school year.

Walsh Middle School
This year we were able to hire an additional School Social Worker. This has allowed us
to monitor additional students, reach out to families, and provide given time for the two
Social Workers to attend more team meetings. The additional monies for details have
helped ensure that functions that need police details have them. 
The 2020-2021 budget stays relatively the same. We did request one additional full-time
Reading teacher. It was determined we were not in compliance to start the school year
with the incoming 6th graders reading needs, so the school district has contracted with
an outside agency to maintain compliance. The long term solution is to hire a 1.0
Reading specialist. Additionally, we requested an additional Spanish/Two Way teacher. 
Our projected numbers are +50 students and this would result in class sizes reaching
25 in some sections. The Contract Service will be used to continue our work with
Engaging Schools to provide professional development to staff during early release
days. 
Originally named the Frost Street Junior High School, the Walsh Middle School was
constructed in 1969. Located at 301 Brook Street, the building contains 201,000
square feet of space and is situated on 22.46 acres of land. The grounds contain a
baseball field, antiquated unused tennis courts and a soccer/lacrosse field. The
parking lot houses 130 vehicle parking stalls. The building was designed with two-
stories. Walsh has four classroom wings, a central administration wing with an
auditorium, gymnasium cafeteria and large kitchen to the rear of the building. There
are two large enclosed courtyards. There is an elevator and handicap chair lift that
complies with current ADA accessibility requirements. Walsh has the capacity for
over 50 classrooms. 
The roof was replaced in 2005 and has a 20-year life expectancy. The heating
system was converted from oil to natural gas and new boilers and gas burners were
installed in 2003. The building has a steam piping distribution system that is in need
of constant service and repair. The building is not equipped with a central cooling
system. There are several window units or split cooling systems in the administrative
offices. A new emergency backup generator was installed in 2009. The building is in
good condition, but is in need of exterior masonry and envelope repairs. Most of the
site paving should be considered for replacement in the near future.

Barbieri Elementary School
This school year has been very productive for Barbieri School. With the strong support
of the Department of Health and Wellness, all but one of our classroom teachers are
now trained in Responsive Classroom, along with our administrative team and some
support, ESL and special education staff. We have integrated this approach with our
long-standing PBIS program (CARE) to strengthen the ways we are creating strong
classroom communities and teaching and reinforcing common expectations throughout
our school. Our new SEB coach has also been key in helping us implement a number of
new Tier 2 interventions and providing coaching for teaching and paraprofessional staff. 
Together, these efforts have had a positive effect on behavior and school climate. We
have also made substantial progress on completing the action steps outlined in our
School Improvement Plan. We were pleased to see these efforts bear fruit as all but one
of our sub-groups met or exceeded their MCAS targets. We expect to see continued
progress on this year's results due to our focus on improving targeted small group
instruction. The Leadership Team has also begun a close study of the Guiding
Principles for Dual Language Education, which will guide our work for the coming year. 
For the next school year, we expect our work to continue strengthening our small group
instruction including increasing the ESL services provided to our growing number of
newcomers at the upper grade levels. We also plan to continue strengthening our 
105

implementation of Responsive Classroom, along with the new SEL programming
(Zones of Regulation and Second Step) begun this year. 
Currently used as an elementary school, the Barbieri Middle School was built in 1974
using a replicated floor plan that matched the Cameron Middle School and the Farley
Middle School. All three facilities were constructed within the same three-year time
period. Located at 100 Dudley Road, the building contains 112,000 square feet and is
situated on 18.71 acres of land. The grounds contain a playground, baseball field and a
soccer/football field. The parking lot has been expanded and currently houses 124
vehicle-parking stalls. The building was designed with multi levels, an open floor plan
concept and few exterior windows. There are two elevators in operation. The building
housed a swimming pool that has been converted to general warehouse space. The
cafeteria is small for a building of its size. At 4,370 square feet, multiple lunch periods
are required for larger student populations and would be problematic if the building was
filled near capacity. Barbieri currently has 31 full classrooms and has a design capacity
of 748 students. The main roof was replaced in 1998 and has a twenty-year life
expectancy. The heating system was converted from electric to natural gas fired boilers
with a hydronic system and utilizes the electric perimeter heat as a supplemental heat
source. The building is cooled via roof-top air handlers. A new emergency backup
generator was installed in 2009. The building is in good general condition and has had
some of its bathrooms renovated to comply with ADA requirements.

Brophy Elementary School
Brophy School continues its long history of meeting the needs of the students served at
our school and our community. In the 2019-2020 school year, we continued to grow our
new Dual Language strand by adding two 2-Way Spanish/English bilingual classes to
grade 1 and a 2nd class to our Kindergarten. Our building is now set up to eventually
have two general education classrooms and two Dual Language classrooms per grade
moving forward. 
For the next school year (2020-2021), we are excited to be offering a new (to Brophy) 
special education program to meet the needs of students on the Autism Spectrum who
require a specialized classroom. The district currently has programs at Dunning
Elementary School and King Elementary School, but due to the increase of incoming
kindergartners exiting Blocks preschool, a third program strand is necessary. We are
excited to welcome these students to our community and to hire, staff, and train new
educators at our school. 
Currently named Brophy Elementary School, the Belknap Road School was
constructed in 1968 using a replicated design plan from the Potter Road School, 
which was built two years earlier in 1966. Two modular classrooms housed in one
mobile unit were added to the building via a connector corridor in 2004. Located at
575 Pleasant Street, the building contains 66,000 square feet plus over 2,000 square
feet of modular space and is situated on 28.13 acres of land. The grounds contain a
playground, two baseball fields, a lacrosse field and a soccer field. The parking lot
houses 80 vehicle-parking stalls. 
The building was designed with a two-story classroom wing, a single story
administration, cafe and gymnasium wing and a central courtyard. There are two
chair lifts within the building that provide handicap access to the stage and
classroom wing level as required by ADA. Brophy has 26 general classrooms. The
roof was replaced in 2002 and has a twenty-year life expectancy. The heating
system was upgraded and new boilers and gas burners were installed in 2006. There
are several window units or split cooling systems in the administrative offices. A new
emergency backup generator was installed in 2009. The building is in good general
condition and has received replacement walkways and sidewalks in compliance with
ADA mandate and funded by capital expenditure. The paving in the parking and
driveway areas requires replacement in the near future.

Dunning Elementary School
School Year 2019-2020 has been an exciting year at Dunning. We welcomed the
kindergarten newcomer Sheltered English Instruction (SEI) program. We also welcomed
many newcomers at most of our other grade levels. Our English Language
Development staff has been working collaboratively with classroom teachers across the
school to ensure the success of all of our newcomers. Another shift at Dunning has
been the addition of specialist’s social emotional learning blocks. Each specialist has
blocks throughout the week where they work with students who require Tier 2
interventions. Our Assistant Principal has done an amazing job playing into the
specialist’s strengths to provide interventions that are effective in supporting student
social emotional, academic and behavioral competencies. We continue to build upon
our STEAM initiative. We have established tech buddies between grade levels, and
have some of our upper grade students teaching our staff members about coding and
use of our programmable robots. 
As we think about next year, we are looking forward to building our cadre of teacher
leaders in the building. We are hoping to send some of our teachers to professional
development during the summer and throughout the next school year to facilitate this
work. As we continue to focus on the social emotional learning of our students, we are
hoping to strengthen the use of Restorative Practices across all areas of the building. 
Lastly, we would like to continue to expand upon our building STEAM initiative.

Hemenway Elementary School
Hemenway Elementary School strives to provide the highest quality education possible
so that each student develops the necessary skills and habits of mind to become a
critical thinker, to be respectful, knowledgeable, and a creative citizen, prepared for the
middle school experience and life in the twenty-first century. Currently we serve 540
students in kindergarten through grade 5. We have 100 English language learners of
which 29 are SEI beginners. We have 23 students in our substantially separate special
education classrooms and 70 students requiring high levels of Inclusion support through
special education. Hemenway School is committed to providing all students with high
quality rigorous, and engaging standards based instruction across the curriculum. 
Hemenway staff engages in collaborative practices and has developed a shared
responsibility for student learning across grade levels and specialties. We are
committed to the belief that all students can learn with high levels of achievement and
growth. Our commitment to a growth mindset extends not only to our students but to our
staff, as adult learners. As a staff, we continue to focus on developing a culture of
thinking in our classrooms that includes teaching moves, routines, and strategies that
promote “making student thinking visible.” By creating this culture of thinking, we are
working to ensure that all students are engaged in meaningful learning across the
curriculum. 
In addition to high academic standards, we have high standards for student behavior. 
Hemenway School’s PBIS team, in collaboration with staff and administration, has
developed the HemenWAY Positive Behavior Matrix and implemented the Hemenway
PAWsitive Behavioral Intervention Program. The PAWSitive Behavior Program is based
upon a systemic approach to proactive, explicitly taught and practiced behavioral
expectations for school-wide behavior and the Response to Intervention model. 
Furthermore, all classrooms, kindergarten through grade 5 have instituted components
of Responsive Classroom, and are implementing the Second Step social competency
program as well as Zones of Regulation, which fosters self-regulation and emotional
control. This year we have been a host site for The Teaching and Learning Alliance, on
four separate days during the 2019/2020 school year, administrators and teachers from
other public school systems have come to Hemenway School to take part in TLA’s
Guided Observation Program, Taking a Closer Look at Exemplary Literacy in K-5
Classrooms. 
Hemenway School’s school improvement plan goals include: To ensure that all students
have equitable access to rigorous and engaging standards-based instruction in order to
110
Page 111
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
increase student achievement and growth by at least 60% as measured by MCAS and i-
Ready. To promote social and emotional wellness in all students and prepare them to
be productive citizens in the 21st century. To foster technology-rich, digital classrooms
and develop 21st Century technology skills among all students. To provide 
differentiated, blended-learning opportunities to all students. To maximize the learning
opportunities for all students by partnering with families. To build on, and continue to
support, our professional culture of collaboration by engaging all teaching teams in
professional development and grade level coaching cycles to foster our school-wide
initiative of Making Student Thinking Visible. 
In order to meet our goals as outlined in our Hemenway School Improvement Plan, we
are requesting additional support: Student Success Coach, 0.5 ESL teacher and a 19.5
hour interventionist. In addition, we feel strongly that providing full time kindergarten
aides to all kindergarten classrooms across FPS is essential to providing equitable
educational opportunities to all FPS kindergarten students. 
Student Success Coach: Across all FPS schools students are coming to school with
increasingly difficult challenges both academically and social-emotionally. Over the past
few years it has become clear that at Hemenway, we need to have a Student Success
Coach to support our students and teachers across grade levels and disciplines. The
Student Success Coach will collaborate with school leadership, teachers and staff to
support implementation of social emotional and behavioral programming and practices
to support individual students and classrooms. This staff person will spend time in
classrooms supporting teachers on their Tier 1 behavioral interventions, and provide
teachers with coaching cycles in classroom management, and in implementing
behavioral interventions with fidelity. This position will provide a dedicated staff member
to oversee development and implementation of all three tiers of PBIS interventions and
supports to all classroom teachers and specialists. Additionally, the Student Success
Coach will provide coaching and PD opportunities to staff in evidence based
approaches that lead to greater teacher effectiveness, higher student achievement and
improved school climate. Currently social-emotional intervention groups are run by the
guidance counselor, social worker, school psychologist and some of our specials’ 
teachers. Because our support team is involved in daily crisis intervention due to
dysregulated, unsafe and acting out students; they are in crisis mode and are often
unable to provide consistent social-emotional support to individuals in need of their
services. Our need for a Student Success Coach is further supported by the needs of
the DD K-2 program which services 23 students and demands the social worker, 
guidance counselor, school psychologist, and administrators' time in responding to
multiple crisis situations.

0.5 ESL teacher: The addition of a 0.5 ESL teacher is imperative to supporting our
growing English language learner population; we currently have three ESL teachers and
a .5 ELD coach. This year our EL population by grade is: K 38/82=46% Grade 1
25/91=28% Grade 2 21/82+24% Grade 3 12/86+14% Grade 4 8/92=9% Grade 5
1/95+1%. We have 35 former limited English proficient students of which 20 are in
grades 4 and 5. As you can see we will be graduating one EL learner in grade 5 and
matriculating 22 new beginner SEI students in K and we estimate at least 20 additional
English language learners. To meet the needs of our EL students we are requesting a
0.5 ESL teacher position for 2021. 
Additional 19.5 hour interventionist: Currently we have one 19.5 hour
interventionist to work with 540 students. Our data supports the need for a math
interventionist, in addition to the literacy interventionist. i-Ready data, MCAS math
data, performance on district assessments and other formative assessments
reinforces the need to provide additional targeted intervention and support for our
students. 
Constructed in 1961, the Hemenway Elementary School is the elder sister school of
the Charlotte Dunning School that utilized the same layout design when constructed
in 1965. Other than location and age, the only main difference between the two
buildings is Dunning does not have modular classrooms additions such as
Hemenway does. Located at 729 Water Street, the building contains 61,500 square
feet plus over 5,000 square feet of modular space and is situated on 14.42 acres of
land. The grounds contain a playground, a baseball field and a small soccer/lacrosse
field. The parking lot houses 70 vehicle-parking stalls. The building was designed as
a single story with a rectangular shape. There are three classroom wings, an
administration and cafe wing and an enclosed courtyard. There are two modular
buildings with connectors at the rear of the building that house four classrooms. 
There are two chair lifts for handicap access as required by ADA. Hemenway has 28
general classrooms. The roof was replaced in 1996 and has a 20-year life
expectancy. The heating system was converted from oil to natural gas and new
boilers and gas burners were installed in 2005. There is no central cooling within the
building. There are several window units or split cooling systems in the
administrative offices. A new emergency backup generator was installed in 2009. 
The building has received replacement walkways and sidewalks in compliance with
ADA mandates funded by capital expenditure. Paving in the parking lots and driveways
is in poor condition and is in need of replacement. In addition, the District is in the
process of a pre-feasibility study in anticipation of submitting a Statement of Interest to
the Massachusetts School Building Authority. An alternative site is also being
considered as part of that study.

King Elementary School
Fiscal Year 2020 was an exciting one for King Elementary School. We welcomed 27
new English Language Learners “newcomers” to King, who were placed in appropriately
ELL-supported classrooms in grades Kindergarten, Grade 1, Grade 2, Grade 3 and
Grade 5. King now boasts 85 students who are currently enrolled in the Sheltered
English Immersion (SEI) program and that number is growing almost daily. Our ESL
team consists of three full-time ESL teachers as well as a 0.2 ELD Coach. To provide
greater support for our newest English language learners, we now have three native
language tutors providing direct assistance in the classrooms so that our students are
able to more successfully access instruction. 
We are also proud to celebrate two of our SEI certified teachers who were invited by the
Professional Learning Team from WIDA at the Wisconsin Center for Education
Research to participate in the WIDA Project. This video project was on best
instructional practices in teaching emergent multilingual learners with various levels of
English language development as they learn with their peers in content classrooms. The
videos that were made in our two classrooms will be shown to educators who
participate in WIDA workshops and online classes. In support of our STEAM program, 
King has continued its partnership with the Museum of Science. As of this winter, all of
our classroom teachers and the district’s STEAM coach have participated in one of 
113
Page 114
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
several focused teacher MoS sabbaticals to learn about and create ways to increase
opportunities for students to engage in the science and engineering practices within
integrated curriculum lessons. Some of our upcoming STEAM events in the spring of
2020 include travelling programs from the Museum of Science for our 5th grade
students to enjoy; Now Hear This: The Sound of Science and Star Lab. 
FY2020 also found King partnering with the district’s Social Emotional Mental Health
Team (SEMH) to support the social, emotional and safety needs of students and staff
through observations and teacher coaching cycles. Additionally, in concert with the
district’s initiative, the King School and its staff have been fully invested in the social
emotional well-being of our students. In the belief that SEL is paramount in a child’s
overall education, teachers have not only provided our students with explicit SEL
instruction using research-based curriculum provided by FPS, such as Second Step, 
Zones of Regulation, and PBIS, but they have also worked hard to integrate SEL into all
academic and content areas. In addition to district-wide professional development, King
staff members have been and will continue to participate in school-based professional
development in Responsive Classroom and Re-thinking Discipline and De-escalation. 
Looking ahead to FY2021, King Elementary School plans to continue to strengthen the
integration of STEAM into curriculum lessons as well as create an easily accessible
STEAM Resource Center so that teachers are better able to access materials and
technology in order to bring the makerspace into their own classrooms any time on any
day, without limitations. We are also looking forward to piloting the use of the world
language functionality of Rosetta Stone. Superintendent Tremblay has asked King staff
for feedback on their experience with the program before potentially rolling it out for
student/family use as a way to learn a new language. This could be an exciting
opportunity for not only our students but for their families as well. It is also our hope that
we are able to increase our 0.2 ELD coach to a 0.5 position to support our rapidly
increasing ELL population as well as the teachers who service them each day. 
Additionally, King will collaborate with the Office of Bilingual Education to develop
systems and protocols as well as identify and acquire appropriate resources to more
effectively welcome and serve our multilingual students and families. This would include
training additional staff to conduct Home Visits. Furthermore, we would like to add to our
current support staff team so that we are better able to provide the much-needed
therapeutic support to meet the increasing social-emotional and behavioral needs of our
student body. Finally, we look forward to the continued allocation of funds so that
classrooms and teachers can be equipped with instructional and classroom supplies
that support student learning. 
We at the King School are most appreciative of all that the School Committee does to
114

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
support each school, each staff member, and most importantly, each student in
Framingham. We look forward to that continued support in FY2021. 
Originally named the Brook Water School, the George P. King Elementary School
was constructed in 1957. Located at 454 Water Street, the building contains 50,000
square feet and is situated on over 18 acres of land. The grounds contain a
playground, baseball field and soccer/lacrosse field. The parking lot houses 110
vehicle-parking stalls. 
The building was designed with two classroom wings connected by an enclosed walk
bridge with a cafe and gymnasium on separate lower levels. There is one chair lift and
one elevator within the building that provide handicap access to all levels as required by
ADA. King has the capacity for 24 full classrooms. 
The roof was replaced in 1998 and has a twenty year life expectancy. The heating
system was converted from oil to natural gas and new boilers and gas burners were
installed in 2001. The building is cooled via rooftop air handlers on the front main wing
and the rear wing is equipped with portable air conditioner window units. The building is
equipped with an emergency backup generator installed in 2011. The building is in good
general condition, and the parking lot is in excellent condition.

McCarthy Elementary School
This year has been a year of refining and establishing structures in support of our two
high leverage goals as articulated in our Turnaround Plan. We started the year with a
community build for our new playground and a restructuring of our morning and
afternoon drop-off and pick-up procedures. We allocated resources for professional
development for teachers in literacy with the Teaching and Learning Alliance, Novak
Consultants, and WestEd and are participating in the Massachusetts Tiered System of
Support Inclusive Instruction Academy. Our Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) has
been working with the Center for Collaborative Education (CCE) to establish protocols
for looking at and using data to identify and inform whole school decisions. 
We are piloting a solution seeking process, utilizing the District Curriculum
Accommodation Plan (DCAP.) We have two staff members sharing the Positive
Behavior Interventions and Supports(PBIS) Coach position who have been working
with a team of teachers to reset our Tier I PBIS program and the Student Support Team
is creating structures for Tier 2 and Tier 3 student supports-Check In Check Out, 
McCarthy MeerKat mentoring program, and other protocols for student support. We
have implemented rounds of Peer Observations, Data Cycles with the ILT, and we will
have completed three rounds of Data Chats with teachers by June, 2020. 
Next year, building off of the structures and professional development we have been
creating and participating in this year, our hope is to continue the work we have started
this year. Supporting teachers in utilizing the resources and processes that have been
provided and implemented, continuously assessing and refining, to create shared
expectations of instructional practices to meet the needs of all students. We hope to
continue the work with the Inclusive Instruction Academy and continue our work to
establish a climate of collective ownership for improving student achievement that will
include a clear understanding of the strategies, structures and processes needed to
accomplish that goal. 
Originally constructed in 1952 the McCarthy Elementary School received major
reconstruction and expansion in 1994. Located at 8 Flagg Drive, the building contains
94,936 square feet and is situated on 20.43 acres of land. The grounds contain two
playgrounds and a baseball field. The parking lot houses 88 vehicle-parking stalls. 
There is one elevator that complies with current ADA access, building and fire code
requirements. McCarthy has 29 full classrooms. One wing, or 50% of the roof was
replaced in 1999 and the remaining 50% in 2007. 
116

The District expects to request Capital Funds in the near future for this project. Each
wing has a twenty-year roof life expectancy. The heating system was converted from oil
to natural gas and new boilers and gas burners were installed in 2003. Selective areas
within the building have central cooling such as administration, cafe, library, computer
and head-end room. The parking lot is in fair condition and repaving should be
considered in the long range plans

Potter Road Elementary School
The fiscal year 2020 was an exciting year for Potter Road Elementary School. We saw
the expansion of the dual-language Portuguese immersion program to second grade. 
Second language acquisition is on display throughout the school with signage in
Portuguese, conversations shifting between two languages, and an increased number
of library books in Portuguese in our library. FY2020 also saw Potter Road hire a new
and innovative mathematics coach to replace a long time employee of the district. 
FY2020 was a year of truly embracing social-emotional learning at Potter Road
including new curriculum and teachers engaging intentionally with students in an effort
to model and teach self-regulation and management. Finally, thanks to our budget, 
principal Larry Wolpe attended some powerful professional development including the
Massachusetts State Administrators Association Conference and a year-long program
from MSAA titled, “The Soul of Leadership” with the sole purpose of “slowing down” to
move ahead and make progress. 
117
Page 118
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Looking ahead to FY2021, Potter’s Dual Language program will expand to grade three
so we will welcome at least one new teacher to Potter Road, perhaps two depending
upon the availability of candidates from Brazil. Also, we look forward to another year of
instructional supplies and funding expenses for our teachers and their classrooms. 
Finally, we are excited to request a Library Media Specialist as we are one of only a
handful of elementary schools without one. We appreciate all of the hard work of the
School Committee and are looking forward to your continued support in fiscal year
2021. 
Constructed in 1966 Potter Road School is the elder sister school of Brophy School
that utilized the same layout design when constructed in 1968. Other than location and
age, the only other main difference between the two buildings is that Potter Road does
not have the added modular classrooms that Brophy School has. Located at 492
Potter Road, the building contains 63,600 square feet of space and is located on 12.75
acres of land. The grounds contain a playground, baseball field, basketball courts and
a multipurpose field. The parking lot houses 80 vehicle-parking stalls. The building
was designed with a two-story classroom wing, a single story administration, cafe and
gymnasium wing and a central courtyard. There are two chair lifts within the building
that provide handicap access to the stage and classroom wing level as required by
ADA. Potter Road has 24 general classrooms. 
The roof was replaced in 1996 and has a twenty-year life expectancy. The heating
system was upgraded from oil to natural gas when one new boiler and natural gas
burner was installed in 1999, and the second boiler and burner were replaced in 2006. 
There is no central cooling within the building. There are several window units or split
cooling systems in the administrative offices. The building is equipped with an
emergency backup generator. The building is in good general condition and has
received reconstruction and replacement of a handicap ramp, curb cuts and new
concrete walkways, in compliance with ADA mandates, as well as new parking and
drainage, funded by capital expenditure. The District is in the process of replacing
asbestos containing floor tile with new vinyl tile. Anticipated completion by August of
2021.

Stapleton Elementary School
Fiscal year 2020 was an exciting year for Stapleton Elementary School. We welcomed
40 new English Language Learners, any who were “newcomers” and were placed
strategically in newly-established “newcomer” classrooms in Kindergarten, Grade 1, 
Grade 3 and Grade 5. Stapleton now has approximately 80 students utilizing ESL
support and receiving Sheltered English Immersion instruction in the classroom (in
2018-2019 we had 45, so this is an increase of approximately 35 students). In an effort
to best support our newcomers, two assistant teachers and a native language tutor
joined our English as a Second Language (ESL) team. Our ESL team began the year
with two staff members: an ESL teacher and 0.5 ELD Coach/0.5 ESL teacher. In
November this split position shifted to a full time ESL teacher in order to meet the
language needs of our growing student population. 
FY2020 also saw Stapleton hire several employees to support the behavioral health and
safety needs of students and staff, including a 15 hour campus aide, additional cafeteria
monitor, and Social Emotional Behavioral Coach. In addition to the district-wide efforts
to prioritize social-emotional learning (SEL) by providing an SEL curriculum and
schedule that allows for SEL instruction in all classrooms daily, Stapleton staff are
working in collaboration with district leaders to strengthen the structures and supports
for all students. Short and long term action steps were identified in December and
January, and the school is already beginning to see the impact of this work (including
additional staff, professional development, planning meetings to discuss student and 
119
Page 120
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
staff placement, increased access to therapeutic supports). In collaboration with District
leaders, Stapleton has also coordinated a series of Family Workshops to support the
continued growth of the inclusive culture at Stapleton. 
Looking ahead to FY2021, the Stapleton community wants to continue to strengthen the
social-emotional and academic support available for all students and meet our goals for
the new design of Stapleton’s Therapeutic Learning Center (TLC) for students requiring
this level of support. This will require continued support from District staff allocated to
Stapleton this spring to coach and monitor progress. Stapleton also wants to assure our
growing EL population has the support and instruction required to acquire English
Language Proficiency, which includes student-centered coaching from an ELD Coach. 
Currently, we have a 0.2 coach, and we hope to expand this support by 0.3 next year to
allow for a .5 ELD coach. Also, we look forward to another year of instructional supplies
and funding expenses for our teachers and their classrooms. Finally, we are excited to
request a Library Media Specialist as we are one of only a handful of elementary
schools without one. We appreciate all of the hard work of the School Committee and
are looking forward to your continued support in fiscal year 2021. 
The Stapleton Elementary School was originally constructed in 1922 and major
additions were constructed in 1956 for added classrooms and then again in 1972
when the library and gymnasium wings were added to the existing school. Originally
named the Saxonville School, it is listed as a historical building. Located at 25 Elm
Street, the building contains 59,600 square feet of space and is situated on 3.4 acres
of land. The grounds contain a small out building, (two car garage) a playground and
a small multi-use ball field. The parking lot currently houses roughly 102 parking
stalls. The building is three stories and has a rectangular shape layout with a large
interior vehicle accessible courtyard. The Building is equipped with an elevator and
chair lift for stage access. Stapleton currently houses 23 full classrooms. The roof was
replaced in 2007 and has a twenty-year life expectancy. The heating system was
converted from oil to natural gas and new boilers and gas burners were installed in
2002. It is equipped with an antiquated steam heating system, unit ventilators, and
roof mounted exhaust fans. The building is not equipped with central cooling. There
are several window unit air conditioners in the administration offices. A new backup
emergency generator was installed in 2011. The entire building has been upgraded
with new window and door replacements throughout the exterior and for exterior brick
mortar joint repainting has been completed. The entire parking lot, ball field, 
courtyard, and rear parking area have all been upgraded. The building is listed as a
historical building and is in fair condition.

Wilson Elementary School
Woodrow Wilson Elementary School – An IB World School has achieved many
accomplishments in FY19-20, particularly with data-driven instruction, Social Emotional
Learning, Dual Language Education, and IB professional development and
implementation. The Wilson School community participated in the self-reflective
process of the International Baccalaureate Primary Years Program (IB PYP) Evaluation
this year, resulting in a renewed focus on revising their transdisciplinary, inquiry-based
curriculum and updating school action plans, unit planners, and policies to guide this
work. 
Standards-based lesson planning, data-driven and differentiated instruction, and many
targeted interventions in math and reading have improved instructional practices and
helped increase assessment results. The Dual Language (50% English, 50% 
Portuguese) strand in Kindergarten and First Grade made great strides in its first year of
implementation and will expand to Second Grade in the 2020-2021 and include 26% of
our students. Social Emotional Learning aligning the IB pedagogy with FPS curriculum
resources created a shared understanding of social skills and provided individualized
support for the whole child. Promoting student agency was also a school-wide focus, 
and one accomplishment was the re-establishment of the 5th grade Student Council
Ambassadors. Another area of improvement was the increase in local and global 
121
Page 122
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
connections to enrich curriculum through meaningful learning experiences. Through
local connections with community partners, such as Jewish Family Services, there has
been excellent family and staff engagement (with 200+ attendees) at our monthly PTO
meetings, which are now called Wilson Community Gatherings. It has, indeed, been an
eventful FY20 year for Woodrow Wilson School. 
Looking ahead to the FY20-21 year, Woodrow Wilson School hopes to maintain the
momentum of the accomplishments from the FY20 year and to continue to build a
positive school climate for students and staff to learn, reflect, and achieve their goals. 
To continue to support our diverse learners’ literacy development, Woodrow Wilson will
need more Portuguese literacy materials for our book room, classrooms, and families. 
With the growth of our Dual Language classrooms, additional curriculum and materials
in both Portuguese and English are essential for this unique program that is part of our
district. In addition, with the continued addition of SEI beginners to our school, more
than any other school in the district, additional native language tutors are essential for
these students’ needs. Based on the data and success in academic achievement with
our current interventionists, two additional interventionists will help target and close the
gaps in students’ academic skills in literacy and math, with time allotted in their
schedule for training and planning of interventions with the support of our coaches. 
Based on the recommendations from the IB Program Evaluation as well as the
guidance of SSOS (Statewide System of Support), Woodrow Wilson School will
implement a revised Sustainable Improvement Plan aligned with an updated IB Action
Plan to outline their goals and hopes for FY21. 
Originally built in 1924 the original Woodrow Wilson School was demolished and
replaced with a new school building on the same site in 1998. At the time of completion
the Wilson School was considered to be "state of the art" in design, technology and
furnishings and continues to be a jewel of the community today. 
Located at 169 Leland Street, the building contains 100,695 square feet and is situated
on 5.02 acres of land. The grounds contain two playgrounds and a small multi-purpose
ball field. The parking lot houses 110 vehicle-parking stalls. The building was designed
with a two-story classroom wing and a two-story administration wing that houses the
cafe, gymnasium and library. There is one elevator that complies with current ADA
access, building and fire code requirements. Wilson has 31 full classrooms. The heating
plant is natural gas fired with air handlers that supply a VAV, or variable air volume
system and supplemental hydronic perimeter heat. The cooling system is a centrifugal
chiller equipped with an exterior water-cooling tower. Although the heating and cooling
systems provide for efficient climate control, they are costly to operate, especially during
the peak, or summer cooling season. The building is equipped with an emergency 
122

Blocks Preschool
During the 2019-2020 school year BLOCKS Preschool worked collaboratively to
accomplish the following: 
1. The completion of repairs in the library area was a significant accomplishment and
was done in concert with the support of other FPS departments and the City of
Framingham. Our support staff, therapists and speech pathologists once again have
offices where they have a more conducive environment to carry out evaluations, 
consult with families and professionals, and provide services to students. Our stage
is once again available to be used for our family nights, presentations, and creative
arts performance now that we were able to move back the furniture/materials back to
the library. Children and staff have already noticed the change and are enjoying
returning to a more appropriate learning and teaching environment. 
2. This year Blocks Preschool received a $10,000 grant through the Early
Childhood Special Education Discretionary Federal Program Grant (298). The grant
funding is focused on social/emotional learning and includes the following: 
123
Page 124
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
● Children’s literature focused on social skills, coping skills, feelings, and self-
regulation; 
● Curriculums/Resources focused on social/emotional learning; and 
● Activity areas for less structured play times to enhance social integration. 
Our goals and hopes for the future is to continue to support and expand preschool
programs in order to allow all our students to have a preschool experience before
entering kindergarten. 
Constructed in 1959, the Juniper Hill School is currently used to house the BLOCKS
Preschool Program. Located at 29 Upper Joclyn Avenue, the building contains
44,300 square feet of space and is situated on 17.94 acres of land. The grounds
contain two new playgrounds and a small multipurpose ball field. The parking lot
houses 80 vehicle-parking stalls. The building was designed as a single story with
three classroom wings and an Administration, cafe and gymnasium wing. Juniper
Hill has 21 general classrooms. A modular library addition was built in 2000 when
2,800 square feet of interior open space was added to the school building. The roof
was replaced in 2001 and has a twenty-year life expectancy. The heating system
was converted from oil to natural gas when one new boiler and natural gas burner
was replaced in 2000 and the second boiler and burner were replaced in 2001. All
classrooms and offices are equipped with window cooling units, and the library is
cooled via two roof top mounted units. A new emergency backup generator was
installed in 2008. The building and parking lot are in good condition.

Fiscal Year 2020 - 2021 Funding Detail
Local Contribution and Chapter 70 State Aid
Local Contribution 
A target local contribution establishes an ideal goal for how much each city and town
should contribute toward its foundation budget, based on the municipality's wealth. Two
measures of municipal wealth are used: aggregate property values and aggregate
personal income, with each given equal weight. The target is recalculated each year
based upon the most recent income and property valuations. The target calculations
assume that local contributions in total should cover 59 percent of the statewide
foundation budget (target local share), with state aid covering the remaining 41 percent
(target aid share). The target local share and target aid share for any individual city or
town will vary in proportion to the municipality's wealth. The target calculation also

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
includes a maximum local share of 82.5 percent, thus ensuring that all communities will
get some minimum amount of state funding. 
The required local contribution for each municipality is based on the previous year's
required contribution, and includes some transition factors so that the shift toward the
target levels occurs over a period of several years. 
● Municipalities whose local contribution requirements are now higher than their
targets will see a reduction in the requirement of 85 percent of the amount above
the target. 
● Municipalities whose local contribution requirements are now lower than their
targets will continue to see their requirements increased by the municipal
revenue growth factor. If they are more than 2.5 percent below their target, an
increment of either 1 or 2 percent will be added to their growth factor.

Chapter 70 State Aid
The Chapter 70 program is the major program of state aid to public elementary and
secondary schools. In addition to providing state aid to support school operations, it also
establishes minimum spending requirements for each school district and minimum
requirements for each municipality's share of school costs. 
Preliminary FY21 Chapter 70 State Aid per the Governor’s budget proposal provides the
City with $58,051,703, a $7,089,523 increase to the City’s FY20 Chapter 70 Aid
($50,961,180).

Revolving Accounts
Framingham Public Schools collects revenue in connection with certain programs that
are supported in full or in part by tuition and/or fees and accounted for in revolving
accounts authorized by M.G.L Chapter 71. School revolving account revenue directly
supports activities associated with the programmatic purpose of each account. 
Facilities Revolving Account 
Funds in this account are from fees collected by permit holders that utilize school
buildings for events, games, practices, etc. 
The Facilities Revolving Account will offset the FY21 budget by $150,000.00. 
Transportation Revolving Account 
Funds in this account are from fees from students riding our buses to and from school. 
A student riding a Framingham Bus per Massachusetts General Law 71, Chapter 68, 
must pay the $250.00 fee set by the School Committee if: 
1. The student is in Kindergarten thru Grade 6 and lives under two miles from the
student’s assigned school; 
or
2. The student is in grade 7 thru grade 12, no matter the distance from the student’s
assigned school. 
The Transportation Revolving Account will offset the FY21 budget by $300,000.00. 
Athletic Revolving Account
Funds in this account are carryover from previously collected gate receipts for athletic
events and user fees from students. Both have been discontinued. 
The Athletic Revolving Account will offset the FY21 budget by $100,000.00

Circuit Breaker 
As defined and explained in prior sections, Circuit Breaker is the State’s Special
Education tuition and transportation reimbursement program. District has budgeted the
maximum reimbursement of 75%. The Circuit breaker reimbursement program provides
state assistance to districts with high cost special needs students. The law reimburses
costs to implement an individual student’s individualized education plan (IEP).
FY21 budget includes $5,958,633 of FY21 Circuit Breaker funding plus $1,500,000
FY20 Circuit Breaker funds.*
*Per DESE Website: Since DESE regulations allow communities and school districts to
carry forward up to one year's worth of state reimbursement, DLS advises communities
build balances in their SPED circuit breaker accounts in years when actual costs
compare favorably with the budget so that in years when SPED costs increase
unexpectedly or the circuit breaker reimbursement drops, there will be some circuit
breaker revenue to cover any unforeseen costs. Building a circuit breaker balance is a
good management practice as it eliminates some of the risk associated with these
unpredictable SPED costs.

reimbursements:

Per Pupil Expenditures
The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) 
employs a comprehensive methodology of calculating per pupil expenditures that
is designed to allow comparative analysis among districts. By using reporting
methods that are consistent across all public school districts statewide, the
DESE’s data allows Framingham to compare its per pupil spending to
surrounding communities. Per pupil expenditures are calculated by dividing a
district's operating costs by its average pupil membership (FTEs), including in-
district expenditures per pupil and total expenditures per pupil, which includes
in-district and out-of-district spending and enrollment. These calculations show
all school operating expenditures including those outside the general fund such
as grants, private donations, and revolving accounts. Expenditures are shown in
categories reported by the school district within the annual DESE End-of-Year
Financial Report. The data submitted by districts to the State is subject to an
annual independent audit, assuring that each school district accurately portrays
revenues and expenditures and consistently reports expenses in appropriate
functional categories. All expenditure groups include the following: 
● school committee appropriations
● municipal appropriations outside the school committee budget that affect
schools
● federal grants
● state grants
● circuit breaker funds
● private grants and gifts
● school choice and other tuition revolving funds
● athletic funds
● school lunch funds
● other local receipts such as rentals and insurance receipts
