Budget Message from the Superintendent 
As your Superintendent, it is with great enthusiasm that I present the FY20 school budget to you. Our
team of school and district administrators, teachers, and support staff recognize that the funding
required to provide the necessary teachers, support staff, and materials accounts for the most significant
part of the City’s spending, but we believe that our community also recognizes the value that a strong
educational system adds when it comes to the desirability of our community. 
With a new Fuller Middle School project underway, expansion of dual language programming that has
begun to drive demand at Woodrow Wilson Elementary School (Portuguese), Brophy Elementary School
(Spanish), Potter Road Elementary School (Portuguese), and Barbieri Elementary School (Spanish), and
the addition of Grade 5 at King Elementary School, these are indeed exciting times to be associated with
the educational renaissance that is taking place in the City of Framingham. 
Our detailed Budget Book illustrates how our spending has been prioritized to focus on teacher retention
and training, the equitable allocation of human and material resources, and strategic investments that tie
back to our multi-year Plan, all of which aims to support children and their families through improved
access to and desirability of all schools in our educational system. On behalf of the nearly 10,000
students who count on the support of their community to provide an education that affords them every
opportunity to meet success in life, I thank you for your support of this budget proposal. 
Very truly yours, 
Robert A. Tremblay, Ed.D., Superintendent

Budget Message from the School Committee
April 5, 2019
To the City of Framingham: 
In partnership with our Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Robert Tremblay, we submit to you a responsibly
crafted and on time Fiscal Year 2020 budget proposal for the Framingham Public Schools. As a School
Committee, we are responsible for exercising co-leadership with the Superintendent in the vision, 
planning, policy making, evaluation, and advocacy for the mission of continuous improvement of student
achievement in the district. We are all committed to providing the highest quality education for all
students and strive to do so while presenting a fiscally responsible budget for our community. 
Fully aligned with the Framingham Public Schools Strategic Plan 2017-2020: Where Every Child Can and
Will Reach High Levels of Achievement, School Improvement Plans at all individual schools, and state
standards, this forward-looking budget creates a pathway to optimize student success. 
We are seeking support from the Mayor and City Council of the proposed funding of $139,896,821 for
next year’s Operating Budget. This funding will allow us to continue to build a strong foundation of high
quality instruction with a fully aligned and engaging curriculum. This budget request is built upon the
philosophy of investing in academic achievement, supporting employees, meeting the requirements of
contractural obligations, establishing access and equity models, enhancing technology, continued
streamlining of operations, creating opportunities for innovation, and data-driven decision making. 
Our Superintendent has built a first rate leadership team in our school district. For the first time, the
district built the budget from scratch, requiring that every resource and every staff position be defended
by principals and departments. The organizational changes in the school system have been profound
both on the instructional and financial fronts. We credit Dr. Tremblay and the administration for building
this budget with a zero-based mentality and process that analyzed each expense line and each individual
position to ensure that the number of staff in the budget aligned with class sizes at each school. As you
can see in Dr. Tremblay’s letter and what follows, this budget clearly expresses what we, as a district, 
value and how we need to invest to achieve the goals, action steps, metrics, and outcomes expressed in
our Strategic Plan. This budget book is a new, thorough document reflecting all planned initiatives and is
6 | P a g e 
Page 7
the most complete and comprehensive budget planning document ever provided to the City by the school
department. 
Throughout our district we are so proud to have recent FY19 success stories showing a strong return on
previous investments and reflections that the Strategic Plan is making tangible progress. This includes
academic growth at Wilson Elementary School, new literacy and STEAM efforts, a student led ecolab at
the high school, voter approval to proceed with the construction of a new Fuller Middle School, award
winning drama and robotics programs, expanded dual language programming to include Portuguese
Two-Way, new social emotional supports, a district-wide fourth-grade field trip to the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, and too many individual achievements by students, recent graduates, and staff to mention! 
With any budget comes the need to plan for year-to-year drivers. This fiscal year, we have carefully
planned for projected increases in enrollment (including a new Grade 5 at King Elementary School), Dual
Language expansion, gifted and talented program investments, added instructional time in all elementary
schools, and, moreover, increased social, emotional, and behavioral health initiatives. We have met our
contractual obligations by investing in personnel to support student achievement and professional
development. This coming fiscal year is unique as it is part of a new series of six collective, multi-year, 
bargaining contracts. Investing in and supporting staff while extending their workload and hours in order
to benefit our students directly is a priority of this budget and requires an additional one-time investment
to meet our contractual obligations. 
At the same time, this request does not fully meet the realistic need our large, complex school district
requires. Fiscal realities are the main reason why this request is not larger. The real need from the
Superintendent’s zero-based budget process found that the district needs an additional $10 million
beyond our request. This is why we strongly support statewide efforts to address the foundation budget
formula and fully utilizing Chapter 70 funding for education as intended by the legislature, allowing this
district to move closer to providing all students with the education to which they are entitled. In recent
years Framingham’s Chapter 70 funding from the state has been diverted to property tax relief. While that
may have helped meet the City’s affordable housing goals, Chapter 70 funds are not intended for
affordable housing relief; rather, they are intended for investments to tangibly improve the schools. At a
time when our leadership and strategic planning efforts are intentional and robust, and the metrics show
recent investments are making impacts, now is the optimal time to invest in our schools. We believe that
the community is strongly supportive of investment in the schools and fully understand the direct
correlation between a strong school system and the future of their children, the growth of their property
values and the city’s growing reputation. We believe also that strong schools encourage new businesses
to locate in Framingham and could help solve the current problem with eroding commercial property
values. Votes in favor of the Fuller project in December was unprecedented and greatly encourages us to
believe that we have unprecedented community support for investing in real classroom improvements
which are long overdue. 
The budget was also developed with transparency in mind, with public forums, meetings, and web-based
communications from the fall of 2018 to the present. In full compliance with Article VI of the City Charter, 
the School Committee held a public hearing on the budget on March 20, 2019 and were encouraged by
having three times more participants than the previous year. 
We are grateful to Mayor Spicer for her collaboration with us in developing this budget as she also serves
as a member of the School Committee. The School Committee appreciates the time and due diligence
the Mayor and then the City Council will spend in reviewing and deliberating on the FY20 Budget for the
Framingham Public Schools. Framingham Public Schools staff are enthusiastic and willing partners who
remain ready to appear before the Mayor and City Council as we seek final authorization to enable the
continuation of this important work and allow the residents from across our City to benefit from our
collective investments.

Mission of the District and Core Beliefs 
The mission of the Framingham Public Schools is to educate each student to learn and live productively
as a critically-thinking, responsible citizen in a multicultural, democratic society by providing academically
challenging instructional programs taught by highly-qualified staff and supported by comprehensive
services in partnership with our entire community. We envision a school district in which every child is
engaged as an active learner in high-quality educational experiences and is supported, at their level, to
ensure growth over time. We believe that with effective effort, time, and practice, all of our students can
and will reach high levels of achievement and demonstrate college and career readiness as a result of
their course of study in the Framingham Public Schools. 
Our city is enriched and strengthened by its diverse cultural heritage and multinational population. Within
our classrooms and neighborhoods, and on our stages and athletic fields, we want learning to be relevant
and connected to developing our students into value-centered citizens who are able to navigate a
complex and inequitable world. We aim to address these inequities--including racism, socio-economic
status and language barriers — to create an environment in which every child can and will succeed. We
want our students to feel safe taking academic risks while mindfully respecting diversity of opinions. To
do so, we must foster supportive and collaborative partnerships between families, the community, and
the school district so that every child reaches a high level of achievement. The foundation of our work is
collaboration, mutual respect, and high expectations, where all educators are reflective of their practice
and feel supported as they continually adjust instruction to improve student performance. 
We are committed to providing a safe and welcoming learning environment in order to increase
achievement and access for all students irrespective of their immigration status, national origin, ethnicity, 
race, religion, sexual orientation, sex and gender identity, socioeconomic status, disability status, and/or
beliefs. We are committed to hardening our facilities through ongoing security improvements and
empowering our students and staff to be proactive in the face of crisis. Our preparedness in this area will
set the stage for an increased focus on learning and teaching. We will continue to monitor enrollment
trends and forecast school building needs as we work together with City officials to prioritize capital
needs so that we always maintain a long-sighted view of the educational needs of the Framingham Public
Schools. 
We strive to afford all Framingham students the opportunity to learn in an educational environment where
the diversity of our students is reflected in our professional staff. We are committed to respecting human
differences and ensuring accountability of actions in an environment that provides needed resources to
support the social-emotional, physical, and mental health needs of our students so that they are ready, 
willing, and able to engage as learners in the Framingham Public Schools. The Framingham Public
Schools strives to adapt instruction to meet the learning and developmental needs of all students, 
including the gifted, through appropriately challenging, high quality, standards-based instruction. In our
efforts to foster an entrepreneurial mindset among students, customize learning experiences and
opportunities, and nurture equitable and inclusive learning environments in our schools, we are
committed to ensuring the availability of opportunities that engender equally high outcomes for every
learner based on individual needs - our vision of personalized learning aimed at addressing achievement
and opportunity gaps.

Framingham Public Schools Strategic Plan 2017-2020 Executive Summary
The Framingham Public Schools Strategic Plan: 2017-2020 (Strategic Plan) is framed by four standards
that align directly with the educator evaluation standards developed by the Massachusetts Department of
Elementary & Secondary Education (DESE). Driven by theories of action within each standard, the
Strategic Plan strives to be a practical resource tool to guide individual school improvement planning and
the development of a responsible, focused budget that is built upon clearly articulated investments aimed
at meeting the needs of Framingham students. 
Standards
Standard I: Curriculum, Planning & Assessment 
Standard II: Teaching All Students 
Standard III: Family and Community Engagement 
Standard IV: Professional Culture 
It stands to reason that if we develop a common understanding of high quality instruction, including
standards-based content knowledge in core content areas, then students will have more equitable access
to rigorous and engaging standards-based instruction to increase student achievement. The creation of a
system and culture of data-based assessment, including analysis, reflection and feedback, will enable
educators in the Framingham Public Schools to target effectively the individual needs of students and
purposefully adjust instructional practices accordingly. 
Standard I: Curriculum, Planning & Assessment - High Leverage Goals
1. Develop a shared understanding of high quality instruction, including content and instructional
strategies, by all staff and executed in all classrooms and instructional settings

Content Areas; 
○ Use Data from Common Assessments to Drive Instruction. 
10 | P a g e 
Page 11
If we promote academic achievement and social and emotional growth for all students, then we are
underscoring and making real the central mission of the Framingham Public Schools. By delivering
targeted supports and interventions using a data-driven approach, then students will receive
differentiated instruction aligned with individual needs to optimize their success. If there is an emphasis
on rigor and excellence
in all aspects of our educational system, then we are establishing appropriately challenging expectations
for all students with the expectation that all students can and will reach high levels of achievement. 
Standard II: Teaching All Students - High Leverage Goals
1. Promote academic achievement and social and emotional growth for all students
2. Deliver targeted supports and interventions based on the analysis of data and identification of
student-specific need

Collaborative Effort
The FY20 proposed budget is a thorough and collaborative effort that included school principals, 
department heads, central office administrators and other important Framingham Public School
personnel. The budget development schedule is included in this section. The budget development group
focused on the needs of all Framingham students and moving the District forward. The effort to build the
FY20 budget began with a zero-based budget model mentality that analyzed each expense line and each
individual position to ensure that the number of staff in the budget aligned with class sizes at each
school. Many hours were invested in the development of the FY20 budget and the team has put forth a
responsible, forward-looking plan that is aimed at driving student achievement through strategic
investments as well as personnel and program efficiencies. The initial FY20 budget request at the start
of the budget process, based on the needs from all departments and all schools started at 12.69% or
$16,884,139 in requests. A strong effort was put forth to analyze each new position request and only
new positions that directly impacted new scheduling, increase in enrollment and compliance were
moved forward to the FY20 budget request. The team understood the City revenue conversation and
again, put forth a reasonable budget to be submitted to the Mayor.

Budget Drivers
1. Collective Bargaining Contracts - The major budget driver of most, if not all School
District budgets, is personnel costs and each Union’s respective negotiated, collectively
bargained contracts drive those costs. Contracts include “cost of living adjustments
(COLA)” and salary schedules that allow for personnel to “step” up the salary schedule at
the completion of each fiscal year. The following list provides the COLA’s for all Unions in
the Framingham Public Schools that are either ratified or assumptions based on ongoing
negotiations: 
Unit A: 3.5 %
Unit B: 1.5% 
Unit C: 2.0% 
Unit N: n/a
Unit P: Increase varies based on individual contracts
Unit S: 2.0% 
Unit T: 2.0% 
Unit V: Increase varies based on individual contracts 
20 | P a g e 
Page 21
2. Federal and State Grant Funding - Assumes level funding for all major Federal and State
grants. Private grants are not assumed in this proposed budget and will be managed
without an effect on the operating budget. 
3. Student Transportation - An increase of 1.3% based on year four of a five year contract
with the current vendor. An increase of one large school bus is included in this FY20
proposed budget based the addition of a grade at King Elementary. The total regular day
bus costs for FY20 are $3,566,009. Collection of bus fees at a cost of $250 per pass paid
for by families is proposed as a total to offset the operating budget by $300,000. 
4. Special Education Tuition and Circuit Breaker Reimbursement - Projected 70% 
reimbursement of net claims for a total reimbursement of $5,042,481 to be used to offset
the FY20 operating budget. An additional $1,750,000 from Circuit Breaker reserves
carried over from Fiscal Year 2019 will offset the operating cost for out of district
tuitions. 
5. Buildings & Grounds and Utilities - Permit fees collected and deposited into the facilities
revolving account for the use of School buildings in the amount of $150,000 will be used
to offset the operating budget. The Buildings and Grounds FY20 budget supports the
maintenance of all buildings and utility costs to the District. Maintenance cost requests
for FY20 are approximately $1.9 million and include but are not limited to, equipment
repair, service contracts, supplies, equipment and vehicle maintenance. Utility costs
reach approximately $2,325,000 and include electric costs, natural gas costs and
telephone service costs. 
Initiatives and Investments
1. King School Grade 5 addition - King Elementary School will become a Kindergarten thru
fifth grade school for the 2019-2020 school year. The addition of fifth grade classroom
teachers, support staff, supplies and materials is included in the FY20 proposed budget. 
2. Wilson Elementary School - FY20 requests for additional positions includes an IB
Coordinator position at Wilson Elementary as needed for IB Certification. The requested
position is related to compliance for certification. 
3. Bilingual Dual Language Expansion - The District is requesting an investment in dual
language through increases to translation services, curriculum planning and the Phonics
program. Increases in professional development, assessments and dual language
memberships are also included in the FY20 request. 
4. Gifted and Talented Investment - An investment into the Gifted and Talented Department
is included in the FY20 request. Operating expenses have increased by 168.17% to
$20,512 and new position requests for this Department include an additional 0.7 FTE
teaching positions and a 0.5 FTE screener for total FTE increase of 1.2. 
Efficiencies 
1. Zero based budgeting - As described in previous sections, both expense budget requests
and salary budget requests are based on a zero based mindset. The intent and idea is to
not simply give a percent increase to the previous year’s budget but to start from scratch
and identify the need. 
2. Special Education Transportation - A change in the District’s transportation vendor for 
out of district students will show a significant savings of approximately $500,000 when
compared to the proposed costs with current vendor for FY20. 
3. Bulk Purchasing - During the FY19 budget, budgets were moved out of individual schools
and into each department. Through the shift in budgeting, Departments are able to
21 | P a g e 
Page 22
purchase materials, supplies, equipment in bulk instead of each individual The District
procures materials and supplies through the The Education Collaborative Cooperative
Purchasing Program. The District also participates in programs that provide District’s
with competitive pricing such as WB Mason, Staples and Home Depot. 
4. Class Size Analysis - Class sizes across the District were analyzed to make sure class
sizes directly and appropriately correlated with assigned personnel to each class. At the
elementary level shifts were made to support enrollment changes from one grade level to
another within and across buildings. At the secondary level there were no reductions to
be made following this process but instead changed the way principals schedule classes. 
All secondary principals are now using Aspen X2 software to generate teacher and
student schedules to ensure maximum efficiency. 
5. Instructional Materials - To allow for access and equity across the District, FY20
instructional supply requests for all K-5 schools are calculated using the algorithm below. 
Grades 6 -12 instructional supply requests are based on need and do not always result in
an increase to the budget. A school by school comparison is also included in this section. 
((# of Classroom teachers x $500) + (# of Special Education teachers + # of Bilingual Teachers) x $250) 
+ (# of support personnel x $100)) = Instructional Supply Budget Line

6. Contracted Services - Included in the FY20 budget request are funds for a number of
contracted services including but not limited to professional development, Health and
Wellness partnerships, Human Resources recruitment, postage, shredding and managed
services. 
7. 1 to 1 Chromebook Pilot Program at King Elementary School - A take home pilot
program is included in the FY20 budget request which will allow students in grade 5 at
22 | P a g e 
Page 23
the King Elementary to take home a chromebook. This initial investment of approximately
$50,000 will hopefully lead to a larger scale of take home programs in future fiscal years. 
The program will assist in the expansion of language offerings and is considered by the
District to be a partnership with the City Council. 
Overview by Responsibility Center
As described in the Executive Summary, the FY20 Budget Proposal aims to maintain excellence across
the District even as enrollment grows and funding tightens. The budget proposal maintains current
staffing and programming to allow all students every opportunity to grow and flourish. An overview by
responsibility center of the District’s priorities and initiatives is provided below. The following section
provides both a narrative snapshot and budget snapshot (FY19 vs FY20) for each responsibility center.

Office of the Assistant Superintendent for Equity, Diversity and Community Development 
The Office for Equity, Diversity, and Community Development (EDCD) advances the Framingham Public
Schools commitment to equity, diversity and community engagement by working to ensure a safe
education and work environment for all. It champions and values the diversity of our district and works to
23 | P a g e 
Page 24
eliminate bias and discrimination from impeding success for all. It recognizes the crucial role families
and community partners play in supporting our work. EDCD will work with community and business
partners to develop and align resources aimed at eliminating barriers and expanding learning access for
all students. EDCD is a realignment of existing roles within multiple departments with a newly enhanced
focus on equity, diversity and inclusion. To fully develop and align with district initiatives, EDCD will
engage in a transparent, environmental analysis and action plan with community partners to layout the
work of the Office over the next 2-3 years. The budget put forth by EDCD reflects an intention to establish
the basic infrastructure of the office while also allowing for the completion of the equity audit and the
inclusion of student, families in staff in an authentic, intentional planning process. Our goal is to develop
initiatives that will increase culturally responsive teaching, expand individual capacity to engage in
diversity and inclusion discussions, disrupt the legacy of systemic racism and create a school culture that
is proactively responsive to the needs of students, families, staff and our greater Framingham
community. 
Office Materials
•  $2,000 is requested for diversity training materials to be used as part of district investigations
into hate and discrimination. 
•  $4,000 is requested in printing materials to allow for the development and printing of
materials that promote equity and inclusion, clarify to students, staff and family the process
for requesting an investigation and additional marketing materials that promote diversity and
inclusion efforts. 
•  $7,500 in general office supplies. 
Diversity Initiatives
•  $10,000 is requested to support the launch of student and staff Affinity Groups. Affinity Groups
are a group of students or staff linked by a common purpose, ideology, or interest. Affinity Groups
play a vital role in ensuring an inclusive environment where all are valued, included, and
empowered to succeed. 
•  $14,000 is requested for Equity Ambassadors. This is a new initiative that will launch in FY20
geared at developing a cohort of district staff who will receive ongoing training in inclusion. Each
school would have a paid staff member serve as an Equity Ambassador working in partnership
with the Assistant Superintendent of Equity and the cohort fellows to promote equity initiatives, 
communicate rising concerns, and serve as an in-house resource to students and
staff. 
•  $10,000 to support an an application for an AmeriCorps fellow to support the
developmental work of EDCD. AmeriCorps is a national service program where
youth committed to serving their country through community work receive a
modest stipend while committing to a 2 year fellowship in a school or community
organization. The individual works a full-time and upon completion receives an
educational award that can be used towards college loans or pursuing a degree. 
•  $3,000 to fund emergency support. A number of investigations have required the
assistance of an additional temporary aide to provide support while the
investigation is underway. These funds are crucial to maintaining the integrity of
the investigations and ensuring appropriate responsiveness to family concerns. 
24 | P a g e 
Page 25
•  $34,000 in contractual services. These funds will be used to contract diversity
professionals to expand the districts offerings of professional development with
a focus on diversity and inclusion. 
•  $2,000 to cover the Assistant Superintendent of EDCD dues to M.A.S.S. 
•  $25,000 to support professional development for administrators, conferences
and associated travel cost including mileage for staff to/from conferences. 
Family Engagement
•  $40,000 to fund 5th Fridays, a new district initiative launched in FY19 to promote family
engagement. The funds would be used to increase the number of events hosted for families on
5th Fridays. 
•  $30,000 to fund part time parent organizers (liaisons) to assist in developing an expanded model
of family engagement that focuses in on parent voice, parent rights and parent support. These
two part time contracted personnel would work in partnership with EDCD and community
partners to develop a new platform for family engagement in the district.

Bilingual Department
The number of students who are learning English as an additional language (ESL) and require direct
instruction, has increased at twice the rate as the
general education population within the last three
years in Massachusetts. According to the
Massachusetts Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education “Over the 11-year period
from 2005-06 to 2015-17, K-12 English learner
(EL) enrollment increased nearly 67 percent…”
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1974 requires
districts to take appropriate steps to address the
language barriers that prevent ELs from
accessing curriculum. Further, No Child Left
Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001 and its successor, 
the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) each address
specific requirements for supporting ELs’ access to
education. 
Due to the increase in enrollment of English learners
since 2014, Framingham Public Schools is listed
among the 15 largest districts in MA enrolling ELs. 
Promoting the academic achievement of
linguistically diverse students continues to be a
priority for the Bilingual Department. Nearly 44% of
all FPS students speak another language in addition
to English at home, and 24% of FPS students are
identified as English Learners and require
instructional support in their acquisition of English. 
Today, these students speak 45 different languages with the two largest groups speaking Spanish
(mostly Central American countries) and Brazilian Portuguese. As per federal and state laws, initial
identification of ELs is a legal mandate; the District must assess students who speak a language other
than English at home upon registration. Since July 1, 2018 the Language Assessment Office has
screened approximately 480 incoming students. One of the
requests being made for FY20 is for the language assessment
testers to be funded out of the operational budget and not Title III
(federal grant) as they are currently. Title III cannot fund these
positions due to a supplanting situation. 
The new [URL: "http://www.doe.mass.edu/ell/look-act.html"] Look Act, signed into law in November 2017, provides

Teaching and Learning Department 
The Office of Teaching and Learning is focused on providing equitable access to high quality instruction
for all students. The department is responsible for all aspects of instruction, curriculum, assessment and
professional development for grades pre-Kindergarten through 12. This oversight is linked to the growth
and achievement of over 300 preschoolers, over 4,400 elementary students, over 1,800 middle school
students and over 2,200 students at the high school. The Department is also responsible for the training
and support of over 1,800 staff members within Framingham Public Schools. This support is provided in
a wide array of areas that are aligned to the District Strategic Plan and includes curriculum, instruction
and materials, assessment and analysis of data as well as professional development. 
Curriculum and Instruction
The District takes pride in the rich diversity of its student population. As stated in our 2017-2020 District
Strategic Plan, “The Framingham Public Schools strives to adapt instruction to meet the learning and
developmental needs of all students, including the gifted, through appropriately challenging, high quality, 
standards-based instruction. In our efforts to foster an entrepreneurial mindset among students, 
customize learning experiences and opportunities, and nurture equitable and inclusive learning
environments in our schools, we are committed to ensuring the availability of opportunities that engender
equally high outcomes for every learner based on individual needs - our vision of personalized learning
28 | P a g e 
Page 29
aimed at addressing achievement and opportunity gaps.” This is the driver for all decisions made across
the district, from the selection of curricular materials to the scheduling of staff. 
The focus of the Office of Teaching and Learning is to provide consistent expectations and procedures
for equitable and high-quality instruction for all students and monitor the implementation of these
expectations and procedures. This includes conducting calibrated walkthroughs at Tier II and Tier III
schools using a district-adopted observation tool, ensuring the alignment of district curriculum to the
Massachusetts state frameworks, and identifying ways to improve access to this curriculum for all
students by supporting teachers in differentiation and universal design for learning. To this end, the
District has made considerable efforts in the last 18 months to communicate clear expectations for
classroom instruction, establish instructional leadership teams at all schools, and develop a curriculum
review process and 7-year review cycle. By providing clear expectations, structures, and supports the
review cycle serves as an opportunity to explore curriculum in regards to its ability to provide equity of
access to all students with a targeted focus on ensuring that barriers are removed for students of color, 
those receiving special education services and those receiving services as an English Language Learner, 
gifted, and economically disadvantaged students. This also includes a dedicated and intentional
investment in STEAM education across the district in coordination with the curriculum review cycle. 
Consequently, this budget includes funding to support STEAM (science, technology education, art, and
math) curriculum specifically in coordination with the Fine and Performing Arts Department. The creation
and implementation of consistent elementary and middle school schedules requires an investment in
additional staff members to provide equitable experiences for students and opportunities for
collaboration, co-planning, and professional learning communities centered upon student achievement. 
Assessment 
The District has a clear purpose and system for reviewing state-level data and efficiently collecting
district and school level assessment and outcome data. The District has worked to create an assessment
profile for students that includes multiple sources of data including diagnostic, formative assessments, 
summative assessments, attendance, discipline and parent, and student surveys. This has included
ongoing, regular conversations with District and school based leaders that provides a comprehensive
picture of student, school, and District performance and focus on the analysis of these multiple sources
of data. Now that these systems are in place, we are working on promoting and sustaining a culture of
shared responsibility and accountability for assessing performance and taking actions that lead to
improved outcomes for all students. This includes a focus on the achievement and growth of all students
with a targeted focus on ensuring that barriers are removed for students of color, those receiving special
education services, those receiving services as an EL, as well as gifted and economically disadvantaged
students that take into account the many variables that can impact student achievement and growth. To
this end, the District has been able to utilize the iReady diagnostic and instructional software as a
calibration tool in grades K-8. The District also invested in Imagine Learning to provide the same supports
for ELs while addressing the specific needs of this population. 
Listed below is the progress that has been made as a District in grades 1-8 in Reading. Tier I (as shown in
green) outlines the number of students performing on or above grade level. This number increase from
35% of students in the Fall of 2018 to 48% of students in the Winter of 2019. Students will be assessed
again at the end of the year. Tier III students (as shown in red) outlines the number of student performing
two or more grade levels below. This number decreased from 32% of students in the Fall of 2018 to 23% 
of students in the Winter of 2019. Students will be assessed again at the end of the year.

Listed below is the progress that has been made as a District in grades 1-8 in Math. Tier I (as shown in
green) outlines the number of students performing on or above grade level. This number increase from
30% of students in the Fall of 2018 to 47% of students in the Winter of 2019. Students will be assessed
again at the end of the year. Tier II (as shown in yellow) outlines the number of students performing one
grade level below. Tier III students (as shown in red) outlines the number of student performing two or
more grade levels below. This number decreased from 27% of students in the Fall of 2018 to 16% of
students in the Winter of 2019. Students will be assessed again at the end of the year. 
It should be noted that Kindergarten is assessed using this tool twice a year and therefore progress
cannot yet be noted. 
Professional Development 
The Office of Teaching and Learning is responsible for providing all professional development related to
curriculum, instruction and assessment. Professional development is provided through the district's
professional development days, mentoring, extension courses, online courses, off-site conferences, and
on-site workshops. Some of this training is supported through the Title IIA grant, but a significant portion
of the district's professional development is funded by the operating budget. Due to the size of the
district's staff and wide variety of specialty areas, the district's need for professional development always
exceeds our ability to provide this support in terms of time and funding. Therefore, the Office and
Teaching and Learning must take into account curriculum revision and purchases, software initiatives, 
revision of curriculum to align to updated standards and our strategy for calibrating expectations and
procedures across the District in terms of walkthroughs, evaluation and supervision, and best practices
when creating the professional development calendar and related opportunities each fiscal year. With this
in mind, the Office of Teaching and Learning continues to make decisions about our professional
development offerings based on District goals and available funds.

Human Resources Department
The Office of Human Resources is responsible for coordinating the recruitment, selection, appointment, 
and promotion of all district employees with the goal of maintaining a dynamic and efficient staff that are
committed to providing outstanding educational programs. Diversity among teachers undoubtedly
advances the academic achievement of students. Compliance obligations establish the baseline; as a
District, Framingham Public Schools are committed to achieving, developing and maintaining a workforce
reflective of the rich racial, linguistic, and cultural diversity of our students. Framingham Public Schools
aims to teach our children, and ourselves, to be culturally proficient and inclusive in order to live, learn, 
and work together in a vibrant and diverse world. Our goal is to reflect the diverse community we serve
and create a great place to work for everyone by embracing the individual skills, perspectives and
experiences our people bring to the workplace and harnessing these for high performance and improved
service delivery. We want our employees to feel included, valued and respected and have access to equal
opportunities, which supports full participation at work. The Office of Human Resources is dedicated to
the goal of building a culturally diverse and pluralistic faculty committed to teaching and working in a
multicultural environment and seeks to retain the diverse talent in our workforce and support our people
to maintain a long and productive working career. 
The Office currently consists of an Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources, an Assistant Director
of Human Resources, an HR Manager, three HR Generalists, and an Administrative Assistant. The team in
the Office of Human Resources processes all the HR-related needs of the district, including compliance
with state and federal regulations and compliance with contractual requirements. The Office processes
all hires, terminations, leaves, salary changes, stipends, reimbursements, retirements, longevity payments, 
etc. In addition, it collaborates with all departments, offers support and guidance to supervisors with the
supervision and evaluation, establishes hiring practices and procedures, ascertains faculty qualifications, 
listens to staff concerns and contractual grievance hearing, conducts investigations, negotiates
contracts, maintains personnel files, creates job descriptions, collaborates with and acts as a conduit to
Payroll, etc. We aspire to be a friendly customer-focused staff, and our goal is to meet the needs of each
of our customers, the employees of Framingham Public Schools. 
The trend in the Office has been to establish efficiencies through human resources information
technology ("HRIS"). TalentEd is now used to keep personnel records and supervision and evaluation
forms and documents as well as to hire employees. We are expanding the Frontline system through
which we manage absences to keep accurate time for hourly employees and thereby diminish the liability
of the District under the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
Our budget for 2019-2020 continues to be mainly focused on the recruitment and retention of staff. Our
foremost priority is to increase the diversity of our staff to ensure not only that our staff demographics
echo those of our students but also to enrich and broaden each student's experience at Framingham
Public Schools. As a result, we have requested additional funds to attend a greater number of recruitment
fairs. We have also requested additional funds to join organizations that assist schools in the recruitment
and retention of diverse teachers, administrators, and coaches. In addition, we have sought funds to
provide training to our staff, including substitutes, in cultural proficiency. Budgeted legal costs have been
shifted to this budget and are included in our request. We utilize several different firms for District legal
matters and are as follows: Petrini & Associates, P.C. (open meeting, policy review, payroll), Morgan, 
Brown & Joy, LLP (employment, collective bargaining) and Benjamin & White P.C. (Special Education and
civil rights).

School Committee
School Committee Policy, budget and hiring/supervision of the Superintendent are the three main
functions of the School Committee. In the area of Policy, the School Committee reviews, revises or
creates policies that support all stakeholders of Framingham Public Schools by engaging key members
of the school community. This work is undertaken by the Policy Sub-Committee on an on-going basis. As
a Committee, it needs to be aware of statutory changes, local, state and federal mandates and changes, 
to ensure its policies are up to-date. In the budget area, the School Committee works through its Finance
Subcommittee to create, monitor and propose an operating budget to the Mayor for the school district. 
The School Committee works closely with the Framingham legislative delegation in advocating for more
resources for Chapter 70 and Circuit Breaker funding as well as for bills that could improve the work of
our District. Historically, the School Committee has been a strong advocate at the Massachusetts
Association of School Committees in having many of their resolutions passed by the Delegate Assembly
at the annual state convention. In the area of supervision/evaluation of the Superintendent, the School
Committee establishes annual goals with the Superintendent and employs the standards by which his
evaluation will be conducted. This is a public process that unfolds over the course of the year and
provides a public conversation about the goals and objectives of the school District as contained in
policy, the operating budget, and the evaluation of the Superintendent. 
Notable School Committee milestones since the last budget cycle are approving central administration
changes which rejuvenated our instructional leadership and hiring a new Executive Director of Finance &
Operations, which rejuvenated our financial leadership. We have also seen progress on multiple fronts
supported by the subcommittee mechanism and those efforts will continue. One FY20 specific budgetary
note is that the School Committee budget is substantially reduced compared to FY19. This is largely due
to transfer of items out of the School Committee budget to other responsibility centers where they more
naturally belong. That includes some legal expenditures which are always managed by Human Resources
and some consulting expenditures which are always managed by Finance & Operations. 
Finally, one critical responsibility of the School Committee is to ensure that the annual budget is properly
funded by the city. With that in mind, special attention has been paid by the School Committee to
equitable allocation of Chapter 70 funding to the schools, and to vitally important communications with
the Mayor, Council and community. These are unusually important for FY20, as it is the first budget
produced by the schools, since we became a city, in which there has been ample time for the proper
implementation of strategic planning directives, with both educational and financial goals plainly

Grants Department
The Grants Development Office (GDO) is responsible for developing process, procedures and providing
operational support to ensure best practice grant management and compliance for the district. The
GDO's goal is to develop and implement strategies for grants and partners funded resources for
programs and services to promote student learning, teacher and curriculum development, and district
capacity for teaching and learning innovation to improve its performance outcomes at all levels across
the board. The Department ensures collaboration cross-functionally, with mutual accountability, a
shared vision and responsibility with all partners, departments, programs, schools, District and
community to provide support to improve students' achievement and close the achievement gap in a
culture of equity and proficiency. GDO monitors, administers and implements over $1.7 million in Title I
funds to ensure the operation and compliance of the Title I Program according to Federal and State
guidelines in accordance to ESSA. The GDO oversees programmatic and financial review of all grants
within the District totaling over $6.5 million respectfully (carry-over funds not inclusive).
The Grants Director also oversees the implementation of the Title I grant and programs. Title I, 
Part A is a federal program designed "[t]o provide all children significant opportunity to receive a
fair, equitable, and high-quality education, and to close educational achievement gaps." Title I, 
Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) provides financial assistance to
states and school districts to meet the needs of educationally at-risk students. The goal of Title I
is to provide extra instructional services, such as intervention and tutoring, and activities which
support students identified as failing or at risk of failing state's challenging performance
standards in mathematics, reading, and writing. Title I Program provides our students with extra
educational assistance beyond the regular classroom.

Business Operations Department
The Business Operations Department is responsible for maintaining accounting and financial record-
keeping for the District. The Department oversees Transportation, Grants, Food Services, Safety &
Security and Buildings & Grounds. The staffing in the Business Operations Office includes the Executive
Director of Finance and Operations, the Assistant Director of Finance, the Salary Accounts Manager, and
four Accounts Payable Specialists. 
The Business Office provides financial reports to all Responsibility Centers (RCs) and is responsible
for recommending budget transfers, as needed, to the School Committee for approval consistent with
School Committee Policy. The Office is also responsible for developing and distributing financial
information to the School Committee's Finance Committee, and may also develop financial reports on
various budget items as needed by the administration or the city. 
The Business Office maintains close communications with the City's Finance Department to ensure the
exchange of all financial information on a timely basis. The Office also coordinates with City auditors
and other auditors (i.e., the Massachusetts Department of Education) to comply with the needs of these
auditors. The Office works closely with the Office of Human Resources on the reconciliation of
information on staffing and payroll to ensure that all financial reporting is current and accurate. 
37 | P a g e

The Business Office’s significant budget items include the annual rental expenses for the Perini Building
where School’s Superintendent and other Administrators are located, copier leases District wide and
costs to send Framingham students to other vocational/technical schools other than the local Technical
School in Framingham. The Business Operations Department continues to work to streamline processes
including procurement and reporting.

Food Services Department
This Department does not rely on any District funding to operate; it relies on revenue soley generated by
the Department and deposited into its revolving account as well as the receipt of state and federal funds
under the School Lunch Program. In addition to providing a critical service to the students of the
Framingham Public Schools, it also supports a number of feeding programs for the greater
Framingham. The Department serves over one million meals, including breakfast and lunch to the
Framingham Public Schools each year. In addition, the Food Services program offers summer food
service programs at over twenty four locations, a majority of which are in Framingham. During this past
Summer of 2018, over fifty-five thousand meals were served by the Department. The food service
Department is in the final stages of introducing a new Breakfast After the Bell Program, where all late
arrival students will still have access to Breakfast up to 10:00 am daily at two middle schools and four
elementary schools. To qualify for universal breakfast, the school must have over 60% of its students
qualify for free or reduced school meals. 
The Department has made an effort to employ student labor as appropriate as a way to expose
students to the work environment and to the special requirements in the production and handling of
food. Indeed every summer, the Department hires students as "lead growers" for the garden at the high
school, and they employ an additional nine students via the PSW works program to help with the
Summer Food Services Program. 
In the coming year, the Department will be introducing a hydroponic grow farm at the high school that
will provide the Department with all the salad greens required for the district's lunch program. This
grow lab will become integrated into the science curriculum at the high school and will be maintained
completely by students. The high school also has installed new action stations including a ramen bowl
station, a made-to-order pasta station and a rotisserie chicken station. 
38 | P a g e 
Page 39
All of the Department initiatives are accomplished without any supplemental funding from the school
District or from the City. The Department income is solely generated by extensive use of grant support
and all the Federal and State feeding programs. The garden at the high school has drawn national
attention as being one of the best examples in the K-12 environment. The leadership of the Department
has been invited to speak at many local and national conferences on the success of the high school
garden. 
On the financial front, the Department has maintained the recommended DESE standard of three
months operating funds in their revolving account. In addition, the Department has been audited
both financially and programmatically and has received glowing reports in each instance. 
Buildings and Grounds Department 
Framingham currently operates one pre-school (BLOCKS at Juniper Hill),  nine elementary 
schools, three middle schools, an alternative high school program at Thayer Campus, and
Framingham High School. Three of our schools were built in the 1950s and have not been 
renovated: King (1957), Juniper Hill (1959) and Fuller (1958). Both King and Juniper Hill have had
some updating done, but Fuller is the one school that has reached the end of its useful life as a school
having served the District first as Framingham South High School and more recently as Fuller Middle
School. We are pleased to begin construction over the summer of 2019 on a new Fuller Middle School
in partnership with the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA).
The remaining schools have either had significant repairs done or additions added that have
prolonged their useful life. The district has a 20-year Capital Plan for all of its schools and we will be
guided by that plan as well as by the conditions that exist or emerge in our buildings. The district has
been supported in its efforts to maintain and upgrade all of our buildings through the City's Capital
Budget process. The Capital Budget for the schools has allowed the district to extend the useful life of
our buildings as evidenced by the number of schools that are 50 years old or older that have not been
renovated or added on to excluding modular. This year's Capital Budget request, as approved by the
School Committee, continues our efforts to keep our buildings functional and sound. 
The District reopened King Elementary School in 2014 in response to our growing district enrollment. 
The original plan was to grow the King School enrollment slowly due to its smaller size (24
classrooms). However, enrollment pressures forced a faster growth for King and the fifth grade will be
added for FY20 making it a K-5 school. 
At Framingham High School, enrollment (2,249) pressures have caused the School to exceed its design
capacity (2,086) sooner than was projected. As a result, we are in the process of reviewing the
building's current use of space to see if there are measures to maximize the use of existing space. The
High School Administration is working with a consulting architect on this effort. Another growing
problem at the High School has been the adequacy of parking. The School Department has added over
60 parking spaces to the High School. Parking lot fees charged to students as well as some insurance
recovery funds were used for this project.

Transportation Department
The Framingham Public Schools Transportation Department operates seventy-five school buses on a
daily basis, transporting approximately 6,500 students including students from St. Bridget’s School and
students from McAuliffe Charter School. In the coming year, the district will be adding one additional
bus ($68,000) to accommodate the growth in enrollment at the King Elementary School as grade 5 is
added to the building. The Transportation system is three-tiered (elementary, middle and high school) 
with 360 runs covering 3,400 live miles of roadways. The district services twenty-three schools
including public, private and parochial schools per state law. Within the public school system, there are
3,000 elementary students, 1,400 middle school students and 1,300 high school students transported
daily. Bus fees collected in FY19 are $313,750, ($300,000 is budgeted to be used in FY20 subject to
approval of this budget) all of which is used to offset the operating costs for the system. The major
cost in this department is for the contract that has been awarded to Durham School Services for five
years beginning in 2016. Staffing at the Transportation Department consists of a Director, an Assistant
Director, two dispatchers, a secretary and inter-district mail delivery employee. The fleet consists of 75
buses, 7 spares with 29 of the 75 buses parked at CSX lot at a cost of $35,000 per year to the District. 
The department’s routing software is scheduled for upgrades and the cost is included in the FY20
proposed budget. The upgrades include the Edutracker package, which allows parent access to the
Edulog Parent Portal to view in real time, the location of their child’s bus. Also included in the upgrade
is a route data analysis to allow optimization for scheduling and routing buses. The district has
expressed great interest in the expansion of late-bus transportation at all our schools. Currently the
district does provide a minimum of after-school transportation for our middle schools that are made
possible through a combination of district funding and a grant. In addition, there are two late-runs at
the high school at a cost of approximately $10,000. As the district seeks ways to increase access to
late-runs, we will coordinate with the Out-of-School time program in order to maximize the availability of
funds both in the operating budget as well as through grant resources.

Technology Department
The Office of Technology is responsible for providing a technical foundation to support the District's
Strategic Plan and maintain an advance learning environment of the 21st century student and
educator. The intent is to collaborate across the spectrum of students, staff and District
administration to meet both instructional and administrative goals of teaching and learning District-
wide.Our focus is to provide seamless access to digital resources, to integrate technology into the
curriculum of the Framingham Public School District, and to assist the learning community through
efficient processes and training. 
The Office of Technology oversees and supports technology across 17 sites, support 1,600 District staff
members, 9,000 students, and many of the community and after-school programs. We provide a wide
breadth of support for technical issues, security and networking, data and analytics, state reporting, digital
curriculum support, and staff professional development. Over the past seven years, the Technology
Department has benefited by a significant investment in technology funding from the City's support of the
School Department's capital budget. The District has used this investment to enhance infrastructure
including core networking, security and wireless access. Additionally, the District has increased the
number of student learning devices in every school and well as enhanced teachers’ digital tool kit. 
In the FY19 budget, the District chose to consolidate all technology hardware expenses into the Office
of Technology budget to be managed centrally. The technology hardware budget line has been
developed using a Sustainability/Life Cycle Model included in Appendix A. The model offers the
opportunity to better leverage timing, purchase power and equity across schools grade-levels and
departments. This practice will continue in the 2019-2020 school year.

Special Education Department
Currently there are 2,090 students (1865 in-district and 225 out-of-district) receiving special education
services, including therapy only, partial inclusion, full inclusion and substantially separate. In addition to
services by special educators, we also provide speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, 
physical therapy, adaptive physical education, orientation and mobility, visual impairment support, applied
behavior analyst support and audiological consultation. 
FY20 Budget Priorities
While the total percentage of special education students has remained the same, the complex social and
emotional needs of our students continues to increase. Specifically, building leaders are seeing students
at a much younger age, including as young as preschool age, exhibiting significant emotional
dysregulation. This year the Health and Wellness Department developed the Social Emotional Mental
Health district team (SEMH), including a psychologist and a BCBA. The team has been very successful in
reducing some of the behaviors by observing students, meeting regularly with school based teams and by
providing concrete tools and action plans for the school based teams to implement. In previous years, 
many of these cases would have risen to the level of needing an emergency special education placement
in an out-of-district setting. Tuition and transportation costs for one out-of-district placement can range
from $60,000-$100,000 and in some instances can be over $100,000. We have seen a reduction this year
in the emergency placements which is a direct connection to the effectiveness of the SEMH team. In
reviewing the cases on which the SEMH team has been consulting, more than half of the students are
already identified as having special education needs. Therefore, the Special Education Department is
partnering with the Department of Health and Wellness and we are advocating for an expansion of the
SEMH team to include a District Sped Interventionist. The school teams will benefit from the District
Sped Interventionist who will demonstrate hands on strategies with the students. The Special Education
Department currently has four floater aides who are used to support students with increased needs in the
district. However, converting two of these floater aide positions to fund the District Sped Interventionist
will have a larger impact on student success. 
In review of our eighth grade student numbers in our substantially separate classrooms who are
transitioning to the high school, our classroom for students with Intellectual Impairments (II) and Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is increasing from eleven students to twenty two students next year at
Framingham High School. In order to maintain compliance with teacher student ratios in our
substantially separate classrooms, an additional classroom will need to be created with a special
educator and an assistant teacher. 
In addition, the Special Education Department at Framingham High School needs an additional special
education teacher due to an increase in the total number of students with disabilities. This year, the high
school started with more than forty additional special education students than the prior year. Many of
42 | P a g e 
Page 43
these students had previously attended Marion High School and others returned from Keefe Technical
High School. 
Unpredictable Costs and Funding
There are many unpredictable costs in relation to out-of-district placements that typically impact the
school budget, including move in students, reconstruction costs and private school cost of living
adjustment (COLA) increases. While we still have those unpredictable costs, next year’s budget is unique
in that it shows a decrease in operational funds. Circuit Breaker funds both FY20 projections and FY19
carry over funds are proposed to bring down the operating budget costs. 
● SY19 significant reduction of costs due to high tuition move-outs and program changes to less
expensive placements ($904,584);
● SY19 significant amount of age-outs (students turning 22) ($1,805,991).

Community Resource Department 
The Department of Community Resource Development (CRD) 
provides Framingham Public School students the opportunity for
the whole student to be engaged before, during and after school
through Out of School Time Programs and community engagement. 
The Department’s responsible for managing all out-of-school time
(OST) programs and many community partnerships. Since 2013, 
the Department has grown from 1 program at Woodrow Wilson to
ten, and three more slated for Fall 2019. CRD is committed to
extending the school day fun for students during vacation weeks, 
some holidays, and summer. Due to the increase in offerings, the
Department continues to service an increased number of students as shown to the side. 
It has been a busy year for CRD! The Department has grown as it continues to increase program
offerings, number of students served, and community partnerships. We look forward to the FY20
school year when we will take on three new Explorers Sites at BLOCKS, McCarthy, and Stapleton, as
43 | P a g e 
Page 44
well as adding December vacation week programming. Explorers continues to be the Elementary OST
program that provides multi-faceted programming like Coding, 3D printing, Mindfulness, Brain time and
more. All of these expansions and enhancements are fully funded by fees collected, grants, and
community partnerships. 
At the secondary level, CRD will be increasing the Nightlife programming (launching in Spring of 2019),
managing the high school summer school program, and providing continued oversight of Resiliency for
Life (RFL). RFL was awarded $100,000 through a state earmark to provide high quality OST
programming for students of RFL. This funding provided support for after school and summer
programming for high school and middle school students. The intention was to provide additional
resources to those middle school students in need of additional social and emotional supports. As we
all know, the transition from 8th to 9th grade is an extremely important and often delicate time for all
students. With the state earmark, CRD is seeking to support these stipends to preserve this important
resource for the District’s most vulnerable population. 
As part of the District Strategic Plan, CRD is piloting Flyers by Night (FBN), a continuing education
program at the High School. With extensive market and field research, FBN is being designed to
increase access to affordable, relevant, and potentially career-igniting classes for Framingham
community members. CRD has visited and learned from existing continuing education programs
across Massachusetts and found one commonality: when done correctly, adult education programs
can be extremely profitable and provide the community with additional education and entertaining
choices for a low cost. In developing our three year plan, it is evident that building a brand and positive
reputation within the community will take time. By requesting funding for a Program Coordinator at
Framingham High School, we hope to have a dedicated staff member lay the foundation for a
potentially lucrative endeavor. CRD anticipates that as Flyers by Night takes off, the profits will pay for
the position, and much more in the future. We are requesting an increase of the FHS Nightlife Program
Coordinator from 0.5 FTE to 1.0 FTE (total of $24,500). In order for the Program To succeed truly, it is
essential for the position to be full time. It is our vision and goal that in the very near future that this
position will be sustained by the fees collected. 
CRD additionally facilitates many community partnerships for the District and schools, our partners
range from higher education institutions, municipal offices, corporate sponsors, and some local banks. 
CRD leverages fees collected, grants and community partnerships to provide equity and access for all
students. However, there are many additional costs, such as administration, transportation, and
custodians, that are often not covered by grants and sponsors. These expenses at bare minimum must
be covered by the district in order to establish a foundation to expand programs and exhibit the
districts commitment to OSTprogramming. Since last year the Department has increased by over five
programs providing programming to an additional 1000 students. 
CRD oversees the following programs:

Adult ESL Department
Framingham Adult ESL Plus was started by a group of Framingham Town Meeting members in 1984, and
since then, the program has served over 25,000 students. The program operates as part of the
Framingham Public Schools but is primarily grant-funded, with the majority of funds coming from the MA
Department of Education. (FPS funds represent approximately 11% of the total program budget). 759
students are currently enrolled in the program with an additional 84 students in volunteer-led Prep
Classes. Students come from over 48 countries and speak 24 different languages. Close to 300 students
are parents or caretakers of FPS students. 
The program is one of the largest Adult ESL program in the state, and has built a strong reputation
through its performance and service to the community. Program administrators currently participate in 14
different boards, community partnerships, and professional development groups. 
46 | P a g e 
Page 47
There are nine morning ESL classes, 25 evening ESL classes, four evening High School Equivalency
classes, and classes that teach students Citizenship Preparation, Computer Skills, and Job Skills. This
program is significantly supported through a Department of Elementary and Secondary Education grant
($913,470), but also through its own fundraising efforts. In FY 2019, 21% of all students are in seats paid
for by outside fundraising, and an additional 10% are in classes
taught by volunteers. 
With the help of public and private funding, the program has grown
significantly over the years. However, the demand is still tremendous. 
The current waiting list for a space in class is over 700 students.

Physical Education Department
The Physical Education Department is to educate minds, develop healthy bodies, promote positive
attitudes towards fitness, physical activity and sports skills. The Department has developed a Peer
Observation matrix, that has been vetted by the Office of Teaching and Learning that allows
everyone in the Department one professional day to visit and observe colleagues in other buildings. 
In addition, the department is working with middle school principals to review schedules with the
goal of having a consistent schedule that is equitable for all students. It is expected that elementary
schedules would follow this effort. The department recently completed an updating of the K-5 PE
curriculum and is working on reorganizing and rewriting the grade 6-8 PE and health curriculums. 
The Physical Education Department has made significant strides and will continue to do so through
this coming school year. The Department, through collaboration with the Business Operations
Department, has streamlined the supply ordering process, learned and implemented Munis and has
established a basis of needs in terms of supplies and programming for K-8.

Athletics Department
Athletics in Framingham has a rich and storied tradition and is likely the most publicly recognized
department in the district. Our athletic teams are a great representation of the richness of diversity in
Framingham and our athletes represent our City on a daily basis throughout the state. For many of our
students, athletics is the motivating factor in better attendance, improved behavior, higher grades, and
greater overall participation in their school community. Framingham is a well-recognized sports
community, and many of our teams are recognized as perennial challengers for league and statewide
accomplishments. 
The Department has three full time employees that manage and support roughly 125 part time coaches
and 3 other ancillary part time staff members. Athletics works in close coordination with Human
Resources, Business Operations, Buildings and Grounds, FHS Administration and Department Heads, and
Special Education. This year was the inaugural season of our new Inclusive Basketball Team which was
a huge success.. We currently have 33 varsity sport offerings with every sport having either sub-varsity or
being "no cut" allowing for unlimited participation. We are currently investigating options for adding both
girls and boys rugby for next season. 
48 | P a g e

Sage (Gifted and Talented) Department
Two exciting and important initiatives of the Sage department for next year are universal screening of all
first graders district wide as well as increased opportunities for teachers to participate in relevant
professional development. 
The Sage budget expense requests related to screening are necessary to ensure equitable identification
and support for gifted and talented students in Framingham. Research has shown that doing universal
screening (screening all first graders across the district) ensures equitable identification of all learners, 
including the underrepresented populations such as English language learners and children of color. In
order to do this screening process, testing materials and staffing to conduct and score the assessments
are greatly needed. Additionally, in order to service the identified students as well as support the
classroom teachers in an effort to increase the rigor and enrichment opportunities for all students, 
additional staffing is needed. At Barbieri, the number of identified students is much greater than other
elementary schools. Additionally, the Sage teacher successfully works with many teachers to provide
extensions and enrichment. However, there is not enough time in her schedule to provide for all requests
or needs. 
The Sage Department’s Review Proposal plans for a full time Sage teacher at all elementary schools in
the future. Through the universal screening process, the numbers of identified students will begin to
49 | P a g e 
Page 50
increase. Therefore teachers will need more time for pull-out classes. Additionally, having more time in a
building will provide the opportunity for Sage teachers to reach far more students through integration into
the classroom setting. As mentioned above, this will increase the rigor and enrichment opportunities for
a much larger number of students both school and district wide. This is why I have asked for full-time
support at the three turn-around schools. 
Another area of need for the Sage department is the opportunity to receive appropriate and relevant
professional development. The education of gifted and talented children is not often part of a typical
teacher training program. Therefore, professional development opportunities are essential for the Sage
teachers. Budgeting for the opportunity for all Sage teachers to take a Learner’s Edge course will allow
for necessary professional growth and the development of a deeper understanding of gifted and talented
pedagogy. Teachers will also gain insight into additional ways to meet the unique needs of this
population.

New Initiatives: 
Registration Gateway- Online Student Registration System: PIC is now using a new online registration
system called Registration Gateway. Registration Gateway is the preferred vendor for Aspen, and data
flows to Aspen once a file is sealed by a PIC registrar, making the registrations more efficient with fewer
chances for error. 
Registration Gateway- Kindergarten School Choice Lottery system: By July 2019, PIC will have its own
Kindergarten School Choice Lottery module. This module will allow Kindergarten lottery to take place
with the click of a button instead of having all PIC staff members involved in this process which has
always being done by hand with at least five staff members involved. Kindergarten lottery results will be
done in minutes instead of days, making the process faster.

Fine Arts Department 
The Fine and Performing Arts in the Framingham Public Schools is a jewel in the crown of our educational
programming for our kids. Framingham has shown that it values the arts as a part of a comprehensive
education. Our theatre program, our instrumental music program, our brand new dance program and our
visual arts programs are some of the best in the state. The theatre program is used as an exemplar in
other communities. 
The request this year shows a small increase in our operating budget. In a continued effort to provide
equity in supplies, materials and curriculum this increase includes the subscription cost for three of our
elementary schools for Quaver Music. Quaver is an online music curriculum resource which is the
foundation of our K-5 curriculum. This subscription and the accompanying technology insures that all
students in the district are receiving the same high quality music experience. The increase in the budget
51 | P a g e 
Page 52
of $19,484 includes these three subscriptions which total $22,050. Without these renewals which happen
every six years, the Fine Arts budget would actually have been reduced by $2,566.00. 
Highlights: 
● Equitable per student formula for elementary and middle school arts funding has provided a “like” 
arts experience for all students in Framingham
● As a result of cost center ordering we have saved between 30% and 50% in discounts from at
least two of our biggest vendors. This savings allowed us to outfit every music classroom with
“standard “ equipment and to provide art supplies at a per student allowance which insured equity
at all schools and relieved the PTO’s from supporting curriculum related materials 
● The String program is now at 3 elementary schools and 30 string instruments were purchased to
start this program. 
● 750 grade four students will attend the Boston Symphony Orchestra in March 2019
● Our dance program at Framingham High School is overenrolled after just one semester. 
● An FHS student was selected for all state and was named first chair- viola- the best player in the
state of Massachusetts
● Our Visual Arts students participated in Youth Art Month and the Globe Scholastic and were
recognized with gold and silver keys in Photography and Visual Art. 
● Ukuleles were introduced and purchased in grade four. 
● Our grade five band program serves 70% of all grade five students in the district

Framingham High School
Originally constructed in 1961 the Framingham North High School shared two wings of the building
named the Winch Park Secondary School. In 1992 one single Framingham High School was created
combining two high schools into one. The district moved the South High School students and faculty
from Flagg Drive into the North High School at 115 A Street. Then in 2001 and through 2007, a major
renovation and construction project was undertaken. Additions to the building added library, science
wings and a mechanical room to the existing structure. The project ran over a year beyond the original
completion date. The original contractor filed for bankruptcy and an insurance bonding company had
to complete the last 5% of the construction project. As a result, As-built drawings and some equipment
start-up data was not provided to the district as per job specifications. 
The building contains 396,000 square feet of space and is situated on 44.35 acres of land. The
grounds contain a synthetic football/soccer field, a field hockey field a tennis court, and multiple ball
fields at the front of the school that is owned and maintained by the Parks and Recreation Department. 
The parking lot houses over 350 vehicle parking-stalls. 
59 | P a g e 
Page 60
The building was designed on multiple levels with a two-story spread footprint and three enclosed
courtyards. There are two elevators that comply with ADA, fire and building code requirements. 
Framingham High School has 90 full classrooms. 
The building is equipped with two separate boiler rooms, two generator rooms and multiple mechanical
rooms. Dual fuel gas fired boilers and water heaters, diesel fired generators and #2 oil stored in an
underground tank for firing boilers on oil in an emergency situation. Roof to air handlers and cooling
provide cooling for half of the building. The other half is piped and has the ability to be expanded with
cooling if a chiller and cooling tower is installed. 
The parking lot has been expanded and sixty-five vehicle parking stalls have been added. The building
is in good general condition, keeping in mind that the structure is 56 years of age. Framingham High
School is listed as a qualified Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) shelter
because underground fuel storage tanks provide for an independent fuel source for the back- up
generators and boilers.

Thayer High School
Currently used as an alternative high school, the Eugene Thayer Campus was originally constructed in
1905 and was named the Lawrence Street Elementary School. Besides housing an elementary school, the
building has seen many uses over its 105-year life. It was home to school administration offices, youth
coordination office, and from 1982 through 1994 the Visiting Nurses Association leased the building from
the school department. In 1995 it became home to the alternative high school. 
Located at 50 Lawrence Street, the building contains 10,800 square feet of space and is situated on
roughly 2 acres of land. The grounds contain a parking lot that house 44 vehicle-parking stalls, but
is need of repair and resurfacing. 
The building was designed with two stories and a basement that houses the mechanical and boiler
room. The building has 5 classrooms. There is a handicap chair lift that provides access to all levels in
accordance with ADA requirements. The heating system was converted from oil to natural gas. One
60 | P a g e 
Page 61
new boiler and gas burner was installed in 2005. There is no emergency backup generator in the
building. The office and classrooms are cooled via portable wall cooling units. 
The exterior of the building was upgraded with roof repairs, new windows, new trim, gutters
downspouts and minor landscaping as a capital improvement in 2008. The roof is slate tiles. The
building is in fair condition. There are no major upgrades planned at this time.

Cameron Middle School
The original Cameron Middle School was constructed in 1973 and was one of three school buildings built
over a three year time period using a replicated design. Major reconstruction replacing over 80% of the
existing structure took place and was completed in 2000. At the time of completion Cameron School was
considered to be "state of the art" in design, technology and furnishings and continues to be a jewel of the
community today. Located at 215 Elm Street, the building contains 114,000 square feet and is situated on
30.75 acres of land. The grounds contain a baseball field, a football field and a soccer field. There is no
playground on site. The parking lot houses 88 vehicle-parking stalls. 
The building was designed with a two-story classroom and administration wing and a renovated
gymnasium wing along with a new cafe and auditorium. There is one elevator that complies with
current ADA access, building and fire code requirements. Cameron has 33 full classrooms. The
heating plant is natural gas fired with air handlers that supply a VAV, or variable air volume system
and supplemental hydronic perimeter heat. The cooling system is a centrifugal chiller equipped with
an exterior water-cooling tower. Although the heating and cooling systems provide for efficient
climate control, they are costly to operate especially during the peak, or summer cooling season. 
The building is equipped with an emergency backup generator, an acid neutralization plant that
provides treatment for lab waste when required by science labs and a duplex sewage ejector
system. The building is in very good general condition with all mechanical systems and general
architectural furnishings in excellent condition.

Fuller Middle School
Constructed in 1958 as the Framingham High School, the building is currently used as Fuller Middle
School. Fuller is also home to the City of Framingham Board of Health Department that occupies 5,000
square feet of building space. In addition, the Buildings and Grounds Department houses its operations
and storage for vehicles and equipment occupying approximately 15,000 square feet of building
space. There are several offices that occupy additional space such as the Adult ESL program (3,600
square feet) and the Parent Information Center (3,000 square feet).
Located at 31 Flagg Drive, the building contains 196,000 square feet and is situated on over 30 acres of
combined property along with the Farley Middle School, currently occupied by the Massachusetts Bay
Community College. Also shared with the college are the football/soccer fields as well as the baseball
field and the adjoining parking area. 
There is no playground on site. The Fuller School has roughly 150 parking stalls available for all of
its occupants. The building was designed on one level with four classroom wings and two closed
courtyards. Fuller has the capacity for over 50 full classrooms. The building was originally equipped
with many skylights that were removed during roof replacement resulting in limited natural light
throughout the main corridors. The heating system was converted from oil to natural gas and new
boilers and gas burners were installed in 2005. The building is not equipped with central cooling. 
There are several window units or split cooling systems in the administrative offices. The building is
not equipped with an emergency backup generator. The current structure of the building is
concrete masonry units with a gypsum deck roof; however, neither the roof nor the walls have any
insulation and both are vulnerable to infiltration of water.The building was constructed on structural
piles and caissons with a crawl space and a dirt floor beneath the entire building. This causes a
musty odor at times within the building. Air quality testing was performed in 2007 when mold spore
count, carbon dioxide, oxygen and carbon monoxide measured levels were reported to be within
allowable limits. The structural concrete floor is suspended and is showing signs of wear. Some
recent upgrades include: auditorium stage curtains and lighting; a new auditorium ceiling; a new
handicap access ramp and an exterior brick wall replacement on the north face or rear of the
building.The building is in poor condition and the roof is at the end of its useful life. The building
also has structural issues where temporary shoring has been installed. 
62 | P a g e 
Page 63
While the Fuller building has reached the end of its useful life, it remains safe for student occupancy and
the district is closely monitoring the building to ensure that it continues to be safe for occupancy. Indoor
air quality is always monitored, especially in those areas that have visible signs of water infiltration or
other signs of deterioration. If an area of concern is identified, the district will relocate students and staff
until the problem has been addressed. In 2015, the roof over the main classroom wing of the building
(approximately 30% of the school's entire roof surface) was repaired by the manufacturer to extend its life
expectancy until construction of the new building is completed. Furthermore, the district engaged a
structural engineer to determine the integrity of the building's foundation and flooring. As a result, the
district installed temporary structural supports in identified areas in 2016, primarily in the maintenance
services garage where vehicles are stored. All of the building's mechanical systems are monitored, and
the air handling system that ventilates the building has been set to run for extended periods of time to
ensure the air in the building is satisfactory at all times. Many of these conditions have existed for some
time at the Fuller building, and the district has responded appropriately to these challenges and will
continue to do so as needed. Based on our experience and ongoing efforts, we are confident we can
continue to maintain the Fuller building in a safe and secure manner until a new building is constructed
and set to open before the 2022 school year.

Walsh Middle School
Originally named the Frost Street Junior High School, the Walsh Middle School was constructed in
1969. Located at 301 Brook Street, the building contains 201,000 square feet of space and is
situated on 22.46 acres of land. The grounds contain a baseball field, antiquated unused tennis
courts and a soccer/lacrosse field. The parking lot houses 130 vehicle- parking stalls. The building
was designed with two-stories. Walsh has four classroom wings, a central administration wing with
an auditorium, gymnasium cafeteria and large kitchen to the rear of the building. There are two large
enclosed courtyards. There is an elevator and handicap chair lift that complies with current ADA
accessibility requirements. Walsh has the capacity for over 50 classrooms. 
The roof was replaced in 2005 and has a 20-year life expectancy. The heating system was converted
from oil to natural gas and new boilers and gas burners were installed in 2003. The building has a
steam piping distribution system that is in need of constant service and repair. The building is not
equipped with a central cooling system. There are several window unit or split cooling systems in the
63 | P a g e 
Page 64
administrative offices. A new emergency backup generator was installed in 2009. The building is in
good condition. Some of the site paving should be considered for replacement in the near future.

Barbieri Elementary School
Currently used as an elementary school, the Barbieri Middle School was built in 1974 using a replicated
floor plan that matched the Cameron Middle School and the Farley Middle School. All three facilities were
constructed within the same three-year time period. Located at 100 Dudley Road, the building contains
112,000 square feet and is situated on 18.71 acres of land. The grounds contain a playground, baseball
field and a soccer/football field. The parking lot has been expanded and currently houses 124 vehicle-
parking stalls. 
The building was designed with multi levels, an open floor plan concept and few exterior windows. There
are two elevators in operation, but they do not meet current ADA code dimensional requirements. The
building housed a swimming pool that has been converted to general warehouse space. The cafeteria is
small for a building of its size. At 4,370 square feet, multiple lunch periods are required for larger student
populations and would be problematic if the building was filled near capacity. Barbieri currently has 31
full classrooms and has a design capacity of 748 students. 
The main roof was replaced 1998 and has a twenty-year life expectancy. The heating system was
converted from electric to natural gas fired boilers with a hydronic system and utilizes the electric
perimeter heat as a supplemental heat source. The building is cooled via roof-top air handlers. A new
emergency backup generator was installed in 2009. The building is in good general condition but requires

Funding Sources - City of Framingham: Framingham Public Schools
Local Contribution
A target local contribution establishes an ideal goal for how much each city and town should contribute
toward its foundation budget, based on the municipality's wealth. Two measures of municipal wealth are
used: aggregate property values and aggregate personal income, with each given equal weight. The target
is recalculated each year based upon the most recent income and property valuations. The target
calculations assume that local contributions in total should cover 59 percent of the statewide foundation
budget (target local share), with state aid covering the remaining 41 percent (target aid share). The target
local share and target aid share for any individual city or town will vary in proportion to the municipality's
wealth. The target calculation also includes a maximum local share of 82.5 percent, thus ensuring that all
communities will get some minimum amount of state funding. 
The required local contribution for each municipality is based on the previous year's required contribution, 
and includes some transition factors so that the shift toward the target levels occurs over a period of
several years. 
● Municipalities whose local contribution requirements are now higher than their targets will see a
reduction in the requirement of 85 percent of the amount above the target. 
● Municipalities whose local contribution requirements are now lower than their targets will
continue to see their requirements increased by the municipal revenue growth factor. If they are
more than 2.5 percent below their target, an increment of either 1 or 2 percent will be added to
their growth factor. 
State Aid – Chapter 70 
The Chapter 70 program is the major program of state aid to public elementary and secondary schools. In
addition to providing state aid to support school operations, it also establishes minimum spending
requirements for each school district and minimum requirements for each municipality's share of school
costs. Preliminary FY20 Chapter 70 State Aid per the Governor’s House 1 budget proposal provides the City
with a proposed $50,064,950, a $2,428,739 increase to the FY19 Chapter 70 Aid.

Revolving Accounts
Framingham Public Schools collects revenue in connection with certain programs that are supported in
full or in part by tuition and/or fees and accounted for in revolving accounts authorized by M.G.L Chapter
71. School revolving account revenue directly supports activities associated with the programmatic
purpose of each account. 
Facilities Revolving Account
The Facilities Revolving Account will offset the “Rehab Special Projects” operating budget line by
$150,000. Funds in this account are from fees collected by permit holders that utilize school buildings for
events, games, practices, etc. 
Transportation Revolving Account
The Transportation Revolving Account will offset the “Transportation Regular Day” operating budget line
by $300,000. The revolving account is where bus fees are deposited. A student riding a Framingham Bus
per Massachusetts General Law 71, Chapter 68, must pay the $250.00 fee set by the School Committee if
the student is in Kindergarten thru Grade 6 and lives under two miles from the student’s assigned school. 
The fee also applies to ALL students in grade 7 thru grade 12 no matter the distance from the student’s
assigned school. 
Athletic Revolving Account
The Athletic Revolving Account will offset “Athletic Transportation” operating budget line by $100,000. 
Funds in this account are from gate receipts for athletic events. 
BLOCKS (Pre-School) Revolving Account
The BLOCKS Revolving Account will offset the BLOCKS Pre-School salary operating budget line by
$400,000. Funds in this account are from gate receipts for athletic events. 
Circuit Breaker
The state special education reimbursement program, commonly known as the circuit breaker program, 
was started in FY04 to provide additional state funding to districts for high-cost special education
students. In FY08 approximately $200 million was paid to districts under this program. 
The threshold for eligibility is tied to four times the state average foundation budget per pupil as
calculated under the chapter 70 program, with the state paying for instance, 75 percent of the costs
above that threshold. In FY08, the state average foundation budget per pupil was $8,852, so if a special
education student cost a district $50,000, the district's eligible reimbursement for that student would be
($50,000 - (4*$8852))*.75 = $10,944. 
For children placed in a school district outside their home town by the Department of Transitional
Assistance or the Department of Children and Families, and for children who have no parents or
guardians in the commonwealth, the reimbursement is 100 percent above the threshold rather than 75
percent. (The Department of Children and Families is the new name for the Department of Social
Services.)
Circuit breaker reimbursements are for the district's prior year's expenses. Each summer, districts submit
claim forms to DESE listing the types and amounts of special education instructional services provided to
each student during the previous fiscal year. Administrative and overhead costs are not reimbursable. 
Standard rates for each type of service are established annually by DESE based on statewide surveys and
196 | P a g e 
Page 197
are used to calculate the reimbursable cost for each student; this simplifies the claim process and
minimizes the documentation which needs to be submitted. For students attending private 766 schools, 
the eligible cost for reimbursement is based on the approved tuition rate set by the state's Operational
Services Division. 
The proposed dollar amount to be used to offset the FY20 Operating budget is $5,042,481 which is an
estimated 70% reimbursement of estimated FY19 eligible instructional services provided to each student. 
An additional $1,750,000 to be used from the Circuit Breaker reserve is included in the FY20 proposal for a
total use of $6,792,481.

RE: FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS - SOCIAL EMOTIONAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EARMARK REQUEST
FY20 - $300,000
Dear Senator Spilka: 
On behalf of the Framingham Public Schools and on behalf of so many districts in the Commonwealth
whom you continue to support as we work together to improve the social, emotional, and behavioral
health of our students, please know that we sincerely appreciate your commitment, as Senate President, 
198 | P a g e 
Page 199
to improving education and recognizing that indeed the social, emotional, and behavioral health of our
students is critical to fostering resilient, empathetic, and workforce-ready graduates. 
I was pleased to attend the Social Emotional Learning Forum that you hosted on January 8, 2019 along
with many members of the Framingham School Committee (including Beverly Hugo among the panelists) 
and my superintendent colleagues from the region. I am also pleased to present you with our proposed 5-
year investment plan for the Framingham Public Schools that directly targets the social, emotional, and
behavioral health needs of students in the Framingham Public Schools. 
Should earmark funds be available to support this work beginning in the 2019-2020 school year, I would
ask that consideration be given to fully funding Year 1 (Y1) of the proposal as presented here. Thank you
very much for your consideration of this request.

Per Pupil Expenditures
The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) employs a
comprehensive methodology of calculating per pupil expenditures that is designed to allow comparative
analysis among districts. By using reporting methods that are consistent across all public school districts
statewide, the DESE’s data allows Framingham to compare its per pupil spending to surrounding
communities. Per pupil expenditures are calculated by dividing a district's operating costs by its average
pupil membership (FTEs), including in-district expenditures per pupil and total expenditures per pupil, 
which includes in-district and out-of-district spending and enrollment. These calculations show all school
operating expenditures including those outside the general fund such as grants, private donations, and
revolving accounts. Expenditures are shown in categories reported by the school district within the annual
DESE End-of-Year Financial Report. The data submitted by districts to the State is subject to an annual
independent audit, assuring that each school district accurately portrays revenues and expenditures and
consistently reports expenses in appropriate functional categories. All expenditure groups include the
following: 
● school committee appropriations
● municipal appropriations outside the school committee budget that affect schools
● federal grants
● state grants
● circuit breaker funds
● private grants and gifts
● school choice and other tuition revolving funds 
202 | P a g e 
Page 203
● athletic funds
● school lunch funds
● other local receipts such as rentals and insurance receipts
