FISCAL YEAR 2021-2022 BUDGET MESSAGES
BUDGET MESSAGE FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS
Dear Framingham Community: 
It is my honor to serve the City of Framingham as Superintendent of Schools. The district’s Senior
Leadership Team and I oversee the day-to-day operations of our City’s complex and diverse school
district of nearly 10,000 students and more than 2,000 employees. Together, district and school
administrators, educators, and support staff strive to support the whole child academically, socially, and
behaviorally, creating relationships between students, educators, families, and community. We are
committed to providing educators with meaningful and relevant support and development and to
implementing technology and facilities that allow teaching and learning to occur in environments that
are healthy, welcoming, and safe. 
Time and resources in FY21 were squarely focused on providing for the most basic needs of our students
and families in the midst of a global pandemic. From food security to reliable and affordable internet
access, to technology in-hand for students to access school from home, monies allocated to the school
department could not have been used more intentionally and responsibly. 
School department efficiencies were found in FY21 and continue to be explored in FY22 as there is
always a need to evaluate the ways in which taxpayer dollars are spent to ensure the best return on
investment and benefits to our children . The release of district office space by the Superintendent’s
decision to not renew the lease at the Perini building, for example, saved more than $550,000 in the
FY21 and subsequent budgets and preserved the teaching and support staff needed to manage the
current remote and hybrid learning model. This was among the most significant budgetary and
operational moves that could have been made in the current fiscal year and, like all of our decision-
making, was driven by our district mission, vision, and core values. 
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  6

FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
The Framingham Public Schools leadership team makes decisions about educational programming and
the operating budget that is necessary to support the vision of the multi-year Strategic Plan which is
framed by the district’s core values: Providing a safe, inclusive, culturally responsive teaching and
learning environment; Engaging antiracist and responsible civic advocates; Respecting diversity of
thoughts, learners, culture, and community; Fostering learning and healthy growth of all students and
staff; Ensuring every school will be an active, participatory, equitable community. 
Our theory of action is fairly simply, but extraordinarily important and undeniably mission-driven: We
believe that if we create multiple pathways for learning and an inclusive environment of social-
emotional wellness, and we strengthen our global educators and engage our families and community in
collaborative partnership, and we ensure all students have equitable access to resources; then we will
provide each student with personalized interventions and accelerations, and advance the achievement, 
success, and wellness of all students. 
This mission-driven budget book illustrates precisely how taxpayer dollars are spent in the school
department. How money is spent speaks directly to what the school department values and upon close
inspection you will see that each and every expense ties back to the strategic goals and objectives that
we have developed in concert with our administrators, teachers, community partners, community
members, and our most valued stakeholders, our students. 
Thank you for your confidence in us and for your unwavering commitment to Framingham students and
families. Leading a school district in a community that so deeply values education is what makes this
work so exciting and meaningful. 
Very truly yours, 
Robert A. Tremblay, Ed.D., Superintendent
Framingham Public Schools
BUDGET MESSAGE FROM THE FRAMINGHAM SCHOOL COMMITTEE
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  7

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
March 31, 2021
To the City of Framingham: 
In partnership with our Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Robert Tremblay, we submit to you a responsibly
crafted and on time Fiscal Year 2022 budget proposal for the Framingham Public Schools. As a School
Committee, we are responsible for exercising co-leadership with the Superintendent in the vision, 
planning, policy making, evaluation, and advocacy for the mission of continuous improvement of
student achievement in the district. We are all committed to providing the highest quality education for
all students and strive to do so while presenting a fiscally responsible budget for our community. 
Fully aligned with the Framingham Public Schools Strategic Plan 2020-2023, School Improvement Plans
at all individual schools, and state standards, we submit to you a forward-looking budget focused on
creating pathways to optimize student success. We are seeking support from the Mayor and City Council
of the proposed funding of $148,232,945 for next year’s Operating Budget. This funding will allow us to
continue to build a strong foundation of high quality instruction with a fully aligned and engaging
curriculum. This budget request is built upon the philosophy of investing in academic achievement, 
supporting employees, establishing access and equity models, enhancing technology, improving safety
and security, legal compliance, meeting contractual obligations, continued streamlining of operations, 
creating opportunities for innovation, and data-driven decision making - all during a time of pandemic
recovery and renewal. 
Throughout our district we are so proud to have recent current school year/FY21 success stories
showing a strong return on previous investments and reflections that the previous and new Strategic
Plans are both making tangible progress. This includes remote and hybrid learning adjustments, moving
to a one-to-one model by providing chromebooks to all students, increased access to high quality
instructional software, a focus on equity and culturally responsive practices in teaching and learning, 
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  8

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
continued growth of our dual language programs, the launch of the new Civics project for all 8th graders
and U.S. History 2 students at the high school, the near-completion of the new Fuller Middle School, and
too many individual achievements by students, recent graduates, and staff to mention! 
Last year’s FY21 budget submission and the year since have been framed by the detrimental impacts of
the COVID-19 pandemic to our community and economy. Long-term closures, quarantines, sickness, 
death, virtual meetings, multiple unforeseen education budget cuts, and more negative change
throughout the year became part of our shared unfortunate realities. With crisis however comes
continued pride. We are all so proud of our school community. Educators, custodians, nurses, food
service employees, secretaries - in fact all FPS staff members, no matter what their roles - have stepped
up this entire school year, along with parents, guardians, and students. Never before has the meaningful
impact schools have on a community been made even more clear during these times. Now, as the
promise of the vaccine provides for lower case numbers and provides us all with hope for a return to
better days, we can begin a phase of renewal and recovery. 
The COVID-19 crisis is not over at the time of writing. It still brings a whole new set of challenges to our
important work, whether it be new mental health services, ongoing technology enhancements for
remote and hybrid learning, food security, or long-term remediation to make up for lost in person time
on learning. All of that comes with a price, yet also with high levels of return on investment. We also
recognize the Chapter 70 enrollment formula’s uncertainty and impact on FPS at the time of writing. 
Unless adjusted during the legislative process, the current legislation reduces the Student Opportunity’s
Act pre-pandemic allocation of $4.3 million in new funding to only $279K in FY22. The necessary and
important work in line with the Act’s goal to “invest in evidence based areas to improve student
outcomes within subgroups who are not achieving at the same high levels as their peers' ' is still a
priority of the District, yet currently remains a new unfunded mandate. 
With any budget comes the need to plan for year-to-year drivers. This fiscal year, we have carefully
planned for projected enrollment fluctuations with Kindergarten deferrals due to the pandemic
expected to grow, the renewal of all six collective bargaining agreements, utility costs, new special
education expenditures required by law, and, moreover, increased social, emotional, and behavioral
health initiatives. With this budgetary approval, we also will meet our contractual obligations by
investing in personnel to support student achievement and professional development. 
Our Superintendent has built a first rate leadership team in our school district. For the third straight
year, the district built the budget from scratch, requiring that every resource and every staff position be
defended by principals and departments. Each new request for FY22 required an explanation and/or
justification in order to be considered for budget inclusion. We credit Dr. Tremblay, Mr. Lynch, and the
administration for building this budget with a zero-based mentality and process that analyzed each
expense line and each individual position to ensure that the number of staff in the budget aligned with
class sizes at each school. As you can see in Dr. Tremblay’s letter and what follows, this budget clearly
expresses what we, as a district, value and how we need to invest to achieve the goals, action steps, 
metrics, and outcomes expressed in our new 2020-2023 Strategic Plan for the District. The budget book
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  9

FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
for FY22 has also been upgraded through the OpenGov Platform to better utilize interactive charts, 
graphs, and narratives. By doing so, we provided our community with a greater level of transparency
and understanding on all school department operations, initiatives, and expenditures. 
The team has put forth a responsible, forward-looking plan that is aimed at driving student achievement
through strategic investments as well as personnel and program efficiencies. We are also pleased to
highlight new initiatives such as methods to implement the recommendations from the equity audit, 
COVID-19 recovery, mental health supports, restoring library media specialist positions at schools
currently with gaps, adding new opportunities for preschool experiences before Kindergarten, summer
programing enhancements, and the renewed Parent Information Center now relaunching as The FPS
Welcome Center. Many of these efforts use grants and will not have any or only minimal impact to the
operating budget. During the next fiscal year we are also excited to see solar panels be added to roofs, 
students and staff back to in person learning, social-emotional behavioral health supports, and the
excitement we cannot wait to share with the community as we open the new Fuller Middle School as
the District’s first new school building in 21 years! 
The budget was also developed with transparency and community feedback in mind, with public
outreach, meetings, additional public comment periods, and web-based communications from the fall of
2020 to the present. In full compliance with Article VI of the City Charter, the School Committee held a
public hearing on the budget on March 17, 2021. 
The School Committee appreciates the time and due diligence the Mayor and then the City Council will
spend in reviewing and deliberating on the FY22 Budget for the Framingham Public Schools. 
Framingham Public Schools staff are enthusiastic and willing partners who remain ready to appear
before the Mayor and City Council as we seek final authorization to enable the continuation of this
important work and allow the residents from across our City to benefit from our collective investments. 
As a committee we also submit this budget sadly one member short from when we started this
important work. School Committee Member Karen Foran Dempsey left us all way too soon on December
24, 2020. We miss our friend and colleague. We will always remember her advocacy and impact to our
community, and to each of us personally.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW
MISSION OF THE FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS
The mission of the Framingham Public Schools is to educate each student to learn and live productively
as a critically-thinking, responsible citizen in a multicultural, democratic society by providing
academically challenging instructional programs taught by highly-qualified staff and supported by
comprehensive services in partnership with our entire community. We envision a school district in which
every child is engaged as an active learner in high-quality educational experiences and is supported, at
their level, to ensure growth over time. We believe that with effective effort, time, and practice, all of
our students can and will reach high levels of achievement and demonstrate college and career
readiness as a result of their course of study in the Framingham Public Schools. 
Our city is enriched and strengthened by its diverse cultural heritage and multinational population. 
Within our classrooms and neighborhoods, and on our stages and athletic fields, we want learning to be
relevant and connected to developing our students into value-centered citizens who are able to navigate
a complex and inequitable world. We aim to address these inequities – including racism, socio-economic
status and language barriers – to create an environment in which every child can and will succeed. We
want our students to feel safe taking academic risks while mindfully respecting diversity of opinions. To
do so, we must foster supportive and collaborative partnerships between families, the community, and
the school district so that every child reaches a high level of achievement. The foundation of our work is
collaboration, mutual respect, and high expectations, where all educators are reflective of their practice
and feel supported as they continually adjust instruction to improve student performance. 
We are committed to providing a safe and welcoming learning environment in order to increase
achievement and access for all students irrespective of their immigration status, national origin, 
ethnicity, race, religion, sexual orientation, sex and gender identity, socioeconomic status, disability
status, and/or beliefs. We are committed to hardening our facilities through ongoing security
improvements and empowering our students and staff to be proactive in the face of crisis. Our
preparedness in this area will set the stage for an increased focus on learning and teaching. We will
continue to monitor enrollment trends and forecast school building needs as we work together with City
officials to prioritize capital needs so that we always maintain a long-sighted view of the educational
needs of the Framingham Public Schools. 
We strive to afford all Framingham students the opportunity to learn in an educational environment
where the diversity of our students is reflected in our professional staff. We are committed to
respecting human differences and ensuring accountability of actions in an environment that provides
needed resources to support the social-emotional, physical, and mental health needs of our students so
that they are ready, willing and able to engage as learners in the Framingham Public Schools. The
Framingham Public Schools strives to adapt instruction to meet the learning and developmental needs
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  11

of all students, including the gifted, through appropriately challenging, high quality, standards-based

experiences and opportunities that engender equally high outcomes for every learner based on
individual needs – our vision of personalized learning aimed at addressing achievement and opportunity
gaps.

The Framingham Public Schools Fiscal Year 2022 (FY22) Budget is designed to reflect the Framingham
Public Schools Strategic Plan and align with individual school improvement plans. Each individual school
improvement plan is framed by four standards that align directly with the educator evaluation standards
developed by the Massachusetts Department of Elementary & Secondary Education (DESE). The
Strategic Plan strives to be a practical resource tool to guide individual school improvement planning
and the development of a responsible, focused budget that is built upon clearly articulated investments
aimed at meeting the needs of all Framingham students. The budget, while driven by the Strategic plan, 
strives to ensure access and equity across the District through a continued zero-based mindset. Many
hours were invested in the development of the proposed FY22 budget mostly through online
interactions due to the pandemic, in order to achieve this. The proposed budget is thorough and reflects
a collaborative effort that could only have been completed with a significant amount of work put in by
school principals and their staff, department heads and their staff, central office administrators and
their staff, the Framingham School Committee, City Council, the City CFO, City Assistant CFO and Mayor
Spicer. The team has put forth a responsible, forward-looking plan that is aimed at driving student
achievement through strategic investments as well as personnel and program efficiencies. 
The budget development schedule is included in a previous section of the budget book to show the
amount of time that was dedicated to the process by all those involved. The budget process focused on
the needs of all Framingham students as well as on moving the District forward. The effort to build the
FY22 budget was tremendous as it occurred during a pandemic and began with a zero-based budget
model that focused on class sizes, personnel analysis and an analysis of each expense line by line. Each
new request for FY22 required an explanation and/or justification in order to be considered for budget
inclusion. A strong effort was put forth to review and ensure that the current staffing levels are
appropriate for FY22 services based on class sizes. From the beginning of the FY22 budget process, the
entire team was made aware that due to the pandemic, City revenue may be limited for the 2021-2022
fiscal year which could affect every City department including the total approved School Department
operating budget. Collectively, we put forth a fiscally reasonable FY22 budget to the Mayor that
supports all Framingham students.

FY22 line by line budget, the individual budget and narrative of fifteen schools and twenty-three

of most, if not all School District budgets across the Commonwealth is personnel costs in the form of
salaries and stipends. Framingham has six unions that each have a negotiated, collectively bargained
contract that drives personnel costs from year to year. The cost of living adjustment percentages, or
COLA, increases a union member’s salary each year, along with potential step and lane increases within
the salary grid included in the agreement: 
Unit A - Teachers, Department Heads, Nurses and Support Staff
Unit B - School and Central Office Administrators
Unit C - Custodial and Maintenance Staff
Unit N - Food Services
Unit P - Principals
Unit S - Administrative Support
Unit T - Support Services 
Unit V - Non-Bargaining: Increases vary based on individual contracts
2. Enrollment and Chapter 70 State Aid - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many districts across the
Commonwealth have collectively seen a decrease in enrollment in the amount of approximately 37,000
students. We have seen a drop in foundation enrollment here in Framingham of 269 students which is
the main driver of the Chapter 70 funding formula. With the decrease from October 1, 2019 to October
1, 2020 of 269 students, Framingham is only set to receive an additional $279,090 in state aid for a total
Chapter 70 amount of $57,034,315. There is a significant push across the state to hold Districts harmless
on enrollment just like the State does when they hold Districts harmless financially. If the formula
factors in October 1, 2019 enrollment numbers, Framingham’s Chapter 70 allocation will increase. 
Enrollment history is as follows:

*Foundation Enrollment includes students that attend charter schools, other school districts or out of
district special education schools in addition to our in-district students 
3. FY21 Special Education Circuit Breaker Reimbursement - Circuit Breaker is the State’s Special
Education tuition reimbursement program and with the implementation of the first year of the Student
Opportunity Act, transportation reimbursement is now part of the program starting in FY22. The Circuit
breaker reimbursement program provides state assistance to Districts with high cost special needs
students and supports through tuition reimbursement and now transportation reimbursement. The
FY22 budget includes $6,521,672 of FY22 Circuit Breaker funding that directly offsets out-of-district
special education tuition costs. The FY22 budget also includes $3,000,000 of FY21 Circuit Breaker
carryover* funds that also directly offset out-of-district special education tuition costs. Further, the FY22
budget includes $512,000 of FY22 Circuit Breaker transportation reimbursement that will pay for out-of-
district transportation costs. 
*Per the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, regulations allow communities and school
districts to carry forward up to one year's worth of state reimbursement, the Massachusetts Division of
Local Services advises communities build balances in their SPED circuit breaker accounts in years when
actual costs compare favorably with the budget so that in years when SPED costs increase unexpectedly
or the circuit breaker reimbursement drops, there will be some circuit breaker revenue to cover any
unforeseen costs. Building a circuit breaker balance is a good management practice as it eliminates some
of the risk associated with these unpredictable SPED costs.

The Circuit Breaker special education reimbursement program was started in Fiscal Year 2003-2004 to
provide additional state funding to districts for high-cost special education students. The threshold for
eligibility is tied to four times the state average foundation budget per pupil as calculated under the
Chapter 70 program, with the state paying up to 75 percent of the costs above that threshold. For Fiscal
Year 2021-2022 the Act sets the threshold at a preliminary number of $46,704 and, for the first time as
mentioned earlier, includes out-of-district transportation costs required by individualized education
programs for students with disabilities. The Act calls for the state paying 25 percent of eligible costs, 
which is 50 percent of the total out-of-district transportation costs. 
The table below demonstrates how the Circuit Breaker formula for tuition reimbursements is applied:

4. New Compliance and Other New Positions - The FY22 budget includes new positions to bring the
District into legal and policy compliance based on student enrollment in the 2021-2022 school year. 
There are 9.0 Full Time Equivalent (FTE) Special Education positions that will add $420,773 to the
District’s operating budget. In addition to the compliance positions, there will be 6.80 FTE added to
support the schools and departments that need it the most after a thorough review of all new requests. 
The 6.80 new positions will add $532,146 to the District’s FY22 operating budget. All new and
compliance positions to be added to FY22 staffing are as follows:

5. Special Education Tuition and Transportation costs - The cost of Out-of-District tuition in the FY22
operating budget is $10,150,796 and out of district transportation will make up $1,392,650 of the
District’s operating budget. Total costs across all funding sources for out-of-district tuition is
$19,672,469 and will support 210 out-of-district placements. The operating budget will cover $9,885,238
of the tuition costs, the FY21 Circuit Breaker will cover $3,000,000 of the total cost and the FY22 Circuit
Breaker reimbursements will cover the remaining $6,521,672. The total cost of Out-of-District
transportation is $4,104,650 with $1,392,650 in the operating budget, $2,200,000 to be covered with
our 240 Special Education grant and $512,000 to be covered through the new Circuit Breaker
transportation reimbursement program funded through year 1 of the Student Opportunity Act.

6. Yellow Bus Transportation - The District will enter into year one of a five year contract with NRT Bus
starting July 1, 2021. NRT Bus is a new vendor to the District and will provide home to school
transportation, transportation for athletic events, field trip transportation and any other extracurricular
events. The total cost for year 1 of the contract totals $6,006,100. This is a decrease of $115,184
compared to the FY21 total transportation contracted amount. 
7. Buildings & Grounds and Utilities - The Buildings and Grounds FY22 budget supports the
maintenance of all buildings and utility costs to the District. In addition to the current school locations, 
FPS central office staff will be relocating to the Farley building in the summer of 2021. FPS will share the
building with MassBay Community College students and staff. Projected utility costs for FY22 include
$279,236 in utility costs for the Farley building, $16,000 of savings from the half year of planned
operation of solar panels at Brophy Elementary and Fuller Middle Schools and $10,000 to support
electric car charging stations. The total utility amount is $1,851,575 for electric costs and $621,661 for
gas costs. 
8. Grants - The District’s Grants Department managed $19,338,897 in FY21 including $10.4million in
federal COVID-19 funding that supported the District through the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimated
FY22 grant amount to be managed is projected at $13.9million plus $13million in potential ESSER III
COVID-19 to support the District due to the pandemic. 
9. Student Opportunity Act - Fiscal Year 2021-2022 will include the first year of the long anticipated
Student Opportunity Act (SOA) which is an act relative to educational opportunities for students and
focuses on student subgroups who are not achieving at the same high level as their peers. The intention
is to provide funding to adopt, deepen or continue specific evidence based programs to close
opportunity and achievement gaps. The funding for the SOA is included in the Chapter 70 funding and
even with increases to the funding rates of benefits, special education tuition, english learners and a
focus on low income students, Framingham will only see a total Chapter 70 increase of $279,090 which
as stated, includes the first year of the Student Opportunity Act. With the minimum aid increase, the
District is unable to implement the many initiatives once planned back in 2020 when the SOA was
initially planned to be rolled out. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed the implementation of the SOA and
based on the Districts enrollment, we went from having significant funding to implement initiatives to
support our students to a minimal Chapter 70 funding number. Fiscal Year 2021-2022 is year one of the
seven year implementation and as our enrollment increases, the hope is that the District will see an
increase in Chapter 70 aid and will allow us to allocate funds towards the SOA initiatives. 
INITIATIVES, INVESTMENTS AND EFFICIENCIES
1. Safety and Security - The District continues to make the safety of our students, our staff, our
volunteers, our visitors and all others that enter our buildings and grounds a top priority. An increase to
the Safety and Security operating budget will allow for additional safety measures to be taken such as
cameras, radios, access controls and additional professional development opportunities for students
and staff. 
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  21
Page 22

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
2. Universal Preschool - The District will make a significant investment in Universal Preschool in fiscal
year 2021-2022. FY22 will be a groundbreaking year for the Framingham Public Schools as we begin our
first phase of implementing a Universal Pre-K program. Funds will be used to open up as many as 70-90
Universal Pre-K seats in partnership with local community partners. This effectively reduces the number
of students who do not participate in Pre-K programming by nearly 50%.
3. Student Achievement - The FY22 budget includes an additional $952,919 to fund 15.80 new positions
which is an investment that will support students across the District. New positions are listed above. 
EFFICIENCIES
1. Zero-based budgeting - The FY22 budget is based on a zero based budget mentality. Each principal
and director were required to submit requests based on what their department or school actually
needs, not submit a request that is a percentage point above and beyond the previous year. All requests
must be justified and quotes must be obtained to justify requests. 
2. Large Yellow School bus Transportation - The District will enter into year one of a five year contract
with NRT Bus starting July 1, 2021. NRT Bus is a new vendor to the District after a formal invitation for
bid process was conducted. The total contract cost of $6,006,100 for FY22 is a decrease of $115,184
compared to the FY21 total transportation contracted amount. The transportation revolving account will
cover $300,000 of the busing costs for FY22. Revenue in this account is from bus fees that families pay
for a seat on the bus. Cost to families is $250 per student with a $500 family cap. Fees are waived for all
families who qualify for free or reduced lunch. 
3. Bulk Purchasing - The District procures materials and supplies through The Education Collaborative
Cooperative Purchasing Program. The District also participates in programs through WB Mason, Staples
and Home Depot that provide the District with competitive pricing. 
4. Instructional Materials - To continue to allow for access and equity across the District, instructional
supply requests for all K-5 schools are calculated using the number of staff members in each building. 
5. Athletic, Field Trip and Out-of-School time Transportation - The District will continue to utilize three
15-passenger buses to transport students to athletic events, field trips and out of school time events. 
The District saves hundreds of dollars every time the 15-passenger is utilized as it avoids the need for a
large school bus to support this need.

BUDGETS AND NARRATIVES BY DEPARTMENT 
The FY22 Budget aims to maintain excellence across the District. The budget maintains appropriate
staffing and programming to allow all students every opportunity to grow and flourish. An overview by
each school and each department is below and includes accomplishments from previous years, current
FY21 initiatives and occurrences and FY22 plans: 
SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS
The Superintendent of Schools and the Senior Leadership Team oversee the day-to-day operations of
our City’s complex and diverse school district of nearly 10,000 students and more than 2,000 employees. 
Together, district and school administrators, educators, and support staff strive to support the whole
child academically, socially, and behaviorally, creating relationships between students, educators, 
families, and community. We are committed to providing educators with meaningful and relevant
support and development and to implementing technology and facilities that allow teaching and
learning to occur in environments that are healthy, welcoming, and safe. 
Time and resources in FY21 were squarely focused on providing for the most basic needs of our students
and families in the midst of a global pandemic. From food security to reliable and affordable internet
access, to technology in-hand for students to access school from home, monies allocated to the school
department could not have been used more intentionally and responsibly. 
School department efficiencies were found in FY21 and continue to be explored in FY22 as there is
always a need to evaluate the ways in which taxpayer dollars are spent to ensure the best return on
investment and benefits to our children . The release of district office space by the Superintendent’s
decision to not renew the lease at the Perini building, for example, saved more than $550,000 in the
FY21 and subsequent budgets and preserved the teaching and support staff needed to manage the
current remote and hybrid learning model. This was among the most significant budgetary and
operational moves that could have been made in the current fiscal year and, like all of our decision-
making, was driven by our district mission, vision, and core values. 
The Framingham Public Schools leadership team makes decisions about educational programming and
the operating budget that is necessary to support the vision of the multi-year Strategic Plan which is
framed by the district’s core values: Providing a safe, inclusive, culturally responsive teaching and
learning environment; Engaging antiracist and responsible civic advocates; Respecting diversity of
thoughts, learners, culture, and community; Fostering learning and healthy growth of all students and
staff; Ensuring every school will be an active, participatory, equitable community. 
The Superintendent reports to the Framingham School Committee and works in partnership with this
board of elected officials and other elected officials, especially the Mayor,City Council, and State
Legislators, as well as municipal departments and division heads. Decision-making, forward planning, 
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  25

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
and partnerships all serve to ensure that all Framingham children have the best opportunities to meet
high levels of achievement and life-long success. 
In FY22, the school department is planning to restore critical positions that were lost in the previous
fiscal year because of temporary leadership reassignments to cover building leadership gaps. Oversight
of teaching and learning and professional development needs of our district, for example, have never
been more important than right now as we work to address learning gaps that are symptomatic of more
than a year of remote teaching and learning. 
Our theory of action is fairly simply, but extraordinarily important and undeniably mission-driven: We
believe that if we create multiple pathways for learning and an inclusive environment of social-
emotional wellness, and we strengthen our global educators and engage our families and community in
collaborative partnership, and we ensure all students have equitable access to resources; then we will
provide each student with personalized interventions and accelerations, and advance the achievement, 
success, and wellness of all students.

ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT FOR EQUITY, DIVERSITY AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
The Office for Equity, Diversity, and Community Development (EDCD) advances the Framingham Public
Schools commitment to equity, diversity and community engagement by working to ensure a safe
education and work environment for all. It champions and values the diversity of our district and works
to eliminate bias and discrimination from impeding success for all. It recognizes the crucial role families
and community partners play in supporting our work. EDCD will work with community and business
partners to develop and align resources aimed at eliminating barriers and expanding learning access for
all students. 
The upcoming fiscal year will be one of the most challenging as schools struggle to meet the needs of
students and families attempting to rebound from a devastating epidemic. Many families have lost jobs, 
homes, businesses, loved ones and the sense of security however fragile that they felt prior to the
COVID-19 crisis. This budget attempts to address some of these challenges by prioritizing resources for
family engagement at the school level, training for staff district wide and additional resources to ensure
we continue our efforts to implement recommendations from the equity audit. It should be noted that
the budget does not include all the equity related efforts in the district as some funds have been
assigned to other department budgets based on oversight.

Finally, FY22 is a groundbreaking year for the Framingham Public Schools as we begin our first phase of
implementing a Universal Pre-K program. Within this budget funds are assigned to open up as many as
70-90 Universal Pre-K seats in partnership with local community partners. This effectively reduces the
number of students who do not participate in Pre-K programming by nearly 50%. Also, as the district
transitions back into the Farley Building we will be launching the FPS Welcome Center, a comprehensive
community center that provides families with holistic services to meet their full scale of need.

MULTILINGUAL EDUCATION
The number of students who are learning English as an additional language (ESL) and require direct
instruction, has increased at twice the rate as the general education population within the last three years
in Massachusetts. Promoting the academic achievement of linguistically diverse students continues to be a
priority for the Multilingual Education Department. Nearly 49% of all FPS students speak another language
in addition to English at home, and 26% of FPS students are identified as English Learners and require
instructional support in their acquisition of English. As per federal and state laws, initial identification, ESL
instruction, and standardized assessment of language acquisition for ELs is a legal mandate and the district
responsibility. Strengthening FPS successful program models for ELs and expanding Dual Language (DL) 
programs in Spanish and Portuguese will continue to be a priority for FY22 and beyond as our three new
elementary programs will soon move into the middle and high schools. Budget requests and advocacy
continue to be for teachers, coaches and paraprofessionals to provide direct service to students and for
resources, both print and digital, for classrooms. As DL programs expand and gain momentum, additional
funds in the expense budget are requested to support DL instruction and professional development. 
Becoming a multiliterate district is our mission. 
The pandemic in late FY20 and FY21 required our department to stretch our already thin resources and
extend additional support to our students and families. The challenges were many and inequities
surfaced in regard to the appropriate access to technology and to the internet for many of our students
and families. Translators and interpreters worked tirelessly to support district departments and school
leaders to provide language access to families and weekly check-ins during the summer. Families
reached out via the department’s Multilingual Connection initiative and requested assistance with 
technology, food needs, and general information regarding the status of the schools and what it meant
for their children. All requests were forwarded to the appropriate departments as needed. Meetings
were held with both the Bilingual and DL Parent Advisory Councils (PACs) to inform and support
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  27

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
families with technology training with the overall goals of sustaining EL student engagement and
interest in learning. Remote learning has not been successful for all of our developing bilingual students
and great efforts continue to be made by our very talented teachers to keep students engaged in their
learning. As the high-needs students return to in-person instruction, we will assess children’s progress
and provide families with robust summer programs in collaboration with district departments. 
There is lots to be excited about FY22. We are looking forward to connecting with all of our students
returning to school, including many newcomers to our district. There will be challenges, but also
opportunities for growth and learning. Our department will continue to provide professional
development for staff, support for schools and language programs, engage teachers in best
instructional methodologies for all students and promote multilingualism across the district. Our
overarching goal is to support the social and emotional needs of our students, ensure that students in
all of our language programs have equal access to academics and extracurricular opportunities, and
support students to reach their potential and aspirations.

The Office of Teaching and Learning is focused on providing equitable access to high quality instruction
for all students. The department is responsible for all aspects of instruction, curriculum, assessment, and
professional development for grades Pre-Kindergarten through 12. This oversight is linked to the growth
and achievement of over 200 preschoolers, over 4,200 elementary students, over 1,800 middle school
students, and over 2,300 high school students. The Office of Teaching and Learning is also responsible
for the training and support of more than 1,800 staff members within Framingham Public Schools. This
support is provided in a wide array of areas in alignment with the District Strategic Plan and includes the
review and development of curriculum, selection of instructional materials, monitoring of local and state
assessments, analysis of data at the school and district level, and targeted professional development to
meet curricular and instructional needs. 
In 2019-2020, we continued classroom visit rounds and structured data meetings with administrative
teams. This work proved to be invaluable in creating opportunities for school and district leaders to
make decisions to improve outcomes for students. We continued to follow our 7-year curriculum review
cycle, including ongoing revision based on feedback resulting from implementation. In elementary, we
focused on the curriculum review of our History and Social Science curriculum to align to the 2018
History and Social Science standards. Additionally, we worked to strengthen the Science units of study in
grades 3-5 to intentionally provide scaffolding of content through the various disciplines; Earth and

Space Science, Life Science, Physical Science and Technology/Engineering. In secondary, we began our
comprehensive review of the English Language Arts curriculum for grades 6-12, which was informed by
an audit of our existing curriculum by Johns Hopkins Institute for Education Policy. We also continued to
roll out our new Technology Education curriculum at the middle school level, with robotics and coding
for all students. As a continuation of our middle school mathematics curriculum review, we revised the
8th grade Algebra 1 curriculum in collaboration with high school math teachers to align the middle
school and high school Algebra 1 Honors curriculum. Furthermore, we continued to support new
courses at the high school including increased Advanced Placement offerings and the initial
development of a Biotechnology course. The Office of Teaching and Learning expanded its support for
professional development aligned with inclusive instructional practices, most specifically with training in
Universal Design for Learning (UDL). While some of our work was paused in the spring due to the
pandemic, our curriculum work and professional development progressed as much as possible remotely. 
2020-2021 has been a year unlike any other. We began the year in a remote setting on the tail of
engaging in crisis learning in the spring of 2020. The Department of Elementary and Secondary
Education reduced the school year to 170 days to allow for ten additional days to prepare educators for
school in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to the pandemic, the Office of Teaching and
Learning shifted its resources to support remote instruction and planned for a concurrent model of
teaching when safety measures supported a shift to a hybrid schedule. Through the lens of Universal
Design for Learning (UDL), we continued to build the District’s capacity to remove barriers to learning by
providing a 36-hour course on UDL to all staff through a partnership with Dr. Katie Novak. The Office of
Teaching and Learning supported virtual instruction through the acquisition of carefully selected
curriculum software including expanded use of RazKids, Newsela, IXL, and BrainPOP. To accommodate
remote learning and physical distancing requirements, necessary adjustments were made to the
curriculum. While this involves new approaches to conducting science experiments and physical
education classes, it also includes a temporary shift of the middle school Technology Education
curriculum. As it would not be equitable or sustainable to offer Robotics instruction to all students
during a pandemic, the department shifted its focus for the 2020-2021 academic year to video
production, utilizing the cloud-based WeVideo platform where students can create and edit videos on
their Chromebooks. Curriculum review is ongoing, concentrating primarily on the development and
implementation of Civics projects in grade 8 and at the high school, as well as finalizing the work from
last year with implementation of pilot units this spring and the selection of high quality texts in
alignment with each review. Additionally, the Office of Teaching and Learning continues its focus on
providing consistent expectations for equitable, high-quality instruction for all students and monitoring
the implementation of these expectations. Through progress monitoring, we regularly analyze various
data points to understand the student experience. Such data includes attendance, usage and pass rates
of identified programs, grades, common assessments, data from classroom visits, and results from
online assessments including iReady, Imagine Learning, iStation and running records. The increased
focus of the school-level Instructional Leadership Teams has led to the district’s recommitment to a
District Data Team to analyze data points aligned to the District Strategic Plan.

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
As we plan for the 2021-2022 school year, the impact of crisis learning in 2020 and the remote learning
experience for the majority of the 2020-2021 school year will need to be considered and analyzed. 
Reviewing curriculum horizontally and vertically to find opportunities for the compacting of standards
and identifying appropriate interventions and extensions based on student need will be a priority. 
Additionally, re-evaluating the curriculum review cycle and examining the usage and return on
investment of the various programs used will also be of importance. These data points, among others, 
will strengthen the work of the District Data Team to measure our success in meeting the goals of the
District Strategic Plan. Our priority continues to be the investment of our resources in providing high
quality materials that will motivate, support, and challenge all of our students so that all children are
engaged and feel connected to their learning and each other as we reacclimate students back to school
and reinvest in the importance of peer to peer interactions.

HEALTH AND WELLNESS
FY19-20 The work of the Department of Health and Wellness (H&W) staff (nurses, social workers, school
counselors, and school psychologists) promotes Framingham Public Schools’ academic mission by
supporting the social, emotional, academic, and physical growth and development of our diverse
student population and the greater school community. In Fall 2019, the department began the rollout of
social emotional learning (SEL) programming at all elementary schools using three implementation
strategies: SEL curricula (Second Step/Second Step Bullying Prevention, Zones of Regulation, Character
Theme of the Month, and Responsive Classroom practices), building equitable and inclusive
environments, and integrating SEL into all aspects of the school day. At the middle schools, teams began
to plan for integration of youth development and restorative practices into their programming. Positive
Behavioral Intervention & Supports (PBIS) continued in practice at both elementary and middle schools. 
The Social Emotional Mental Health Team (SEMH) expanded its consultation and clinical services with
the inclusion of a district therapeutic coach. 
FY 20-21.This past year has brought significant challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Several
H&W staff are active members of the district COVID Team and have been integral to planning and
implementation of the district’s risk reduction strategies for reopening schools. School nurses have
provided contact tracing for the district and the city. Other H&W staff have supported our students and
families in need of medical/mental health services, food, housing, and insurance. H&W staff are leads in
the implementation of the COVID attestation app, MyMedBot, the DESE sponsored weekly pooled
testing program for students, and PCR testing for staff. The continuation of the SEL roll out was
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  30
Page 31
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
interrupted by the pandemic. To continue to meet the social emotional needs of elementary students, 
elementary schools have focused on delivering the SEL curricula with fidelity during remote learning. 
Time was allocated in each teacher's schedule to have a morning meeting with students to connect, 
build inclusive virtual learning environments, and to check in all students socially and emotionally. This
work is supported by the addition of a Social Emotional Behavioral coach at each of the elementary
schools. In January 2020, the district carried out an assessment of district discipline data and practices in
preparation for the development of a Code of Character, Conduct, and Support which began in earnest
in January 2020 and has continued through the year in spite of the pandemic. The goals of the new Code
are to significantly reduce disproportionality in student referrals and suspensions, introduce
consequences and interventions that are aligned, respectful, equitable, viable and restorative, improve
school climate and student/adult relationships, and increase student attachment to school. 
FY21-22 As we enter the next school year, H&W staff will continue to be actively involved with leading
the district’s response to COVID-19. In addition, supporting our students’ social, emotional and mental
health needs will be a primary focus. SEL will be focused on the continued integration of the Learning
and Life Competencies into all aspects of the school day through targeted social emotional behavioral
teacher coaching. Implementation of the district Code of Character, Conduct, and Support will begin in
August and continue throughout the year. The rollout will include multiple professional development
offerings to prepare all staff, including administrators, educators, bus drivers, custodians, food services, 
and school resource officers to successfully transition from a punitive model of discipline to one that is
supportive, respectful, and fair. The Code and our SEL work in combination will facilitate each school’s
efforts to create and deliver effective interventions that are targeted, data based, and support the
success of the whole child.

HUMAN RESOURCES
The Office of Human Resources is responsible for coordinating the recruitment, selection, appointment, 
and promotion of all district employees with the goal of maintaining a dynamic and efficient staff who
are committed to providing outstanding educational programs. The Office of Human Resource is
dedicated to the goal of building a culturally diverse and pluralistic faculty committed to teaching and
working in a multicultural environment and seeks to retain the diverse talent in our workforce and
support our people to maintain a long and productive working career. The Office currently consists of an
Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources, an Assistant Director of Human Resources, an HR
Manager, three HR Generalists, and an Executive Assistant. The team in the Office of Human Resources
processes all the HR-related needs of the District, including compliance with state and federal
regulations and compliance with contractual requirements. The Office processes all hires, terminations, 
leaves, salary changes, stipends, reimbursements, retirements, longevity payments, etc. In addition, it
collaborates with all departments, offers support and guidance to supervisors with the supervision and
evaluation, establishes hiring practices and procedures, ascertains faculty qualifications, listens to staff
concerns and contractual grievance hearing, conducts investigations, negotiates contracts, maintains
personnel files, creates job descriptions, collaborates with and acts as a conduit to Payroll, etc. We
aspire to be a friendly customer-focused staff, and our goal is to meet the needs of each of our
customers, the employees of Framingham Public Schools. 
Budgeted legal costs, besides Special Education legal costs, are in this department’s budget. We utilize
several different firms for District legal matters and are as follows: The City Solicitor (Petrini &
Associates, P.C.), (open meeting law, policy review, municipal leases, payroll), Morgan, Brown & Joy, LLP
(employment, human resources, collective bargaining) and Benjamin & White P.C. (Special Education
and civil rights).
This past year, we have continued making advances in the management of the payroll process across all
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  32

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
schools and departments and have updated accruals. The Office of Human Resources was instrumental
in establishing the District’s COVID-19 Plan and in participating as a leader of the District COVID Team. In
addition to dealing with typical HR-related tasks noted above, we have spent considerable time
addressing COVID-related staffing concerns and resultant District challenges. We continued modifying
our hiring practices to reduce bias and promote inclusivity and diversity in FPS. The Office of Human
Resources also expanded its scope by assuming significant work in developing the District’s professional
development for all employees. This role will be increased even further next year as we seek the
enrichments of all our staff. 
Our goals for 2021-2022 will be to continue delivering high value work through both strategic and
administrative expertise by increasing FPS leadership capacity, working to develop professional
pathways for all employee groups, and implementing succession planning for key roles; perfecting
system performance; attracting, hiring, retaining, and rewarding talent that echoes the demographics of
our community by beginning to baseline employee engagement and attrition factors, augmenting
recruiting efforts for all hard to fill and key positions, improving the substitute teacher program to
ensure quality substitutes are in front of students, and enhancing new hire orientation experience for all
employees; communicating essential information consistently and accurately; and further aligning our
policies, systems, and processes and enhancing data integrity and fidelity.

SCHOOL COMMITTEE
Policy, budget and hiring/supervision of the Superintendent are the three main functions of the
School Committee. In the area of Policy, the School Committee reviews, revises or creates policies
that support all stakeholders of Framingham Public Schools by engaging key members of the school
community. This work is undertaken by the Policy Subcommittee on an on-going basis. As a
committee, it needs to be aware of statutory changes, local, state and federal mandates and
changes, to ensure its policies are up-to-date. In the budget area, the School Committee works
through its Finance Subcommittee to create, monitor and propose an operating budget to the
Mayor for the school district. Additional Subcommittees for the 2020-2021 term include: Buildings &
Grounds; Teaching & Learning; Equity, Inclusion, and Diversity; Health and Wellness; and Climate
Change, Environment, and Sustainability. 
The School Committee works closely with the Framingham legislative delegation in advocating for
more resources for Chapter 70 and Circuit Breaker funding as well as for legislation that could
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  33
Page 34
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
improve the work of our district. Historically, the School Committee has been a strong advocate at
the Massachusetts Association of School Committees in having many of their resolutions passed by
the Delegate Assembly at the annual state convention. In the area of supervision/evaluation of the
Superintendent, the School Committee establishes annual goals with the Superintendent and
standards by which his evaluation will be conducted by the School Committee. This is a public
process that unfolds over the course of the year and provides a public conversation about the goals
and objectives of the school district as contained in policy, the operating budget, and the evaluation
of the Superintendent. 
The School Committee budget consists of stipends provided for each member in the City Charter, the
Executive Assistant’s salary, and operational costs. While planning for the 2020 and 2021 budgets, the
School Committee took a deeper look into their budget and rearranged some items, moving them to
responsibility centers that seemed more accurate for the costs, and to be able to track the funds more
accurately. Another consideration was upcoming terms ending and an election, which brought new
members on who may need additional training or resources, leading to an increase in the funds for
professional development. The School Committee also instituted additional transparency measures
including the use of electronic recording devices for all subcommittee meetings, and transcription
contracting services if requested by the Subcommittee Chairs to support meeting minutes. The School
Committee continues to be a member of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees (MASC),
which offers many trainings (including the ones by law members must take), services, resources, the
comprehensive review and updates to all policies, and online management of the policy manual. For
FY22, the School Committee is looking to reduce the department budget due to reforms in areas such as
office supply reductions, utilizing free professional development versus paid whenever possible, and
moving items relating to contract negotiations to the Human Resources account.

GRANTS DEVELOPMENT
The Grants Development Office (GDO) is responsible for developing process, procedures and providing
operational support to ensure best practice grant management and compliance for the district. The
GDO's goal is to develop and implement strategies for grants and partners funded resources for
programs and services to promote student learning, teacher and curriculum development, health and
wellness support and enrichment, Innovation and evidence-based practices, a deeper learning for all, 
and District capacity for teaching and learning innovation to improve its performance outcomes at all 
levels across the board. The team ensures collaboration cross-functionally, with mutual accountability, a

BUSINESS OPERATIONS
The Office of Business Operations is responsible for the budget, maintaining accounting and financial
record-keeping for the District. The Office oversees Transportation, Grants, Food Services, Safety &
Security and Buildings & Grounds. The staffing in the Business Operations Office includes the Executive
Director of Finance and Operations, the Assistant Director of Finance, the Salary Accounts Manager, and
four Accounts Payable Specialists. The Business Office provides financial reports to all Responsibility
Centers (RCs) and is responsible for recommending budget transfers, as needed, to the School
Committee for approval consistent with School Committee Policy. The Office is also responsible for
developing and distributing financial information to the School Committee's Finance Subcommittee and
may also develop financial reports on various budget items as needed by the administration or the City. 
The Business Office maintains close communications with the City's Finance Department to ensure
the exchange of all financial information on a timely basis. The Office also coordinates with City
auditors and other auditors (i.e., the Massachusetts Department of Education) to comply with the
needs of these auditors. The Office works closely with the Office of Human Resources on the
reconciliation of information on staffing and payroll to ensure that all financial reporting is current
and accurate. The Business Office’s significant budget items include all copier leases across the
District at $475,000 and costs to send Framingham students to other vocational or technical schools
at approximately $380,850. This Office looks forward to the next fiscal year and will continue to work
collaboratively with City and School departments to implement efficiencies and streamline processes
including procurement and reporting.

FOOD SERVICES 
The Office of Food Services is a “self-funding” entity that operates financially independent from the
school district’s budget and does not rely on any district funding to operate. It relies on revenue solely
generated by the department and deposited into its revolving account as well as the receipt of state and
federal funds under the School Lunch Program. In addition to providing a critical service to the students
of the Framingham Public Schools, it also supports a number of after school snack programs and food
pantries for the greater Framingham school community. The Office has had an aggressive mission in
upgrading the culinary facilities to meet the demands set forth by the USDA to participate in the
National School Lunch Program. With that, there has been a vast array of projects undertaken during the
2019-2021 school years. 
Overview: 2021/2022 Department Initiatives- Due to the impact of COVID-19, the focus of the entire
Department during school year 20/21 was in providing meals to the community. From the start of the
pandemic in March of 2020, through the end of February 2021, the Food Services department has
distributed 304,712 meals to those in need, and at no cost to the city budget. 
● New Fuller Middle School Opening- The opening of this new location will be a major
focus of the Department. Installing a complete new concept in Middle School dining. 
Following a more B&I college model of an open serving area concept. A departure for
the 5-well steam table commercial look. 
● High School - Upgrade Salad Station to offer more plant based options to the Students. 
The new Station will almost double the daily offering and be Board of Heath compliant
with the new Covid sneeze guard guidelines. 
● District Festive Meal & Cultural Events- Roll out a special events meal calendar that
will showcase certain ethic foods, cultural events or moments in a country's history
that is celebrated with food. 
● Harvest of the Month- Updated concept working with the Massachusetts Farm to
School collaborative. We will showcase more fruits & vegetables of the month, with tie
in from our hydroponic farm and our Student based farm. 
Community Eligibility Program (CEP) - We added two new schools for 20/21 and hope to increase in
21/22. So now there are four Schools in the District that are fully CEP and they are Brophy Elementary
School, Fuller Elementary School, Thayer High School and Wilson Elementary School. To become a
totally free CEP location the school must have a population that is 60% free directly certified via the
virtual gateway. The Food Service Department is focused on growing the CEP profile of the District. The
CEP process for 21/22 starts as of April 5th and the hope is to add a minimum of two more location

***Major discussion taking place at the USDA that may result in all school meals being Universal Free. 
Student Employment and Intern Program - Despite the pandemic the Food Service Dept still managed
to hire summer students working in concert with MassHire Metro South/West. Not only did the
Students help with production of pandemic meals but we also held nutrition classes for them, tought by
our summer interns from BYU, Marshall and Framingham State. We hope to expand in the summer of
20/21 depending on Student availability. 
Summer Food Service Program - This program should be renamed as the pandemic life line to the
community! It was the food service that on March 13th 2020, shut down all culinary locations, spun it’s
complete operating model around and within five days had multiple pandemic feeding sites open to the
community. Those sites and the dedication of the Food Service Staff resulted in over 250,000 meals
being served under COVID-19 Relief. For the summer of 2021, the Food Service Department is looking to
maintain Open Feeding sites to aid all in the Framingham community still struggling from the pandemic’s
fallout. 
Project Forecast for 2021-2022 - With a full return to in-person learning in the fall, we expect a huge
surge in Student participation in the school meal program. The Food Service Department is in a semi- 
rebuilding stage with a return to in person dining after a year away. The impact to the culinary facilities
has not been positive and has resulted in mass equipment failures across all formats. Commercial
equipment does not hold up well after being shut down for prolonged periods of time and thus we
expect to be dealing with higher than normal equipment failures during the 21/22 school year. School
year 21/22 will be all about getting back to some level of “normal”, revive all our Student participation
and get federal funds coming in to stabilize the department. 
Financial - The department's operating profile has been decimated during the pandemic with the
revolving account being in an accelerated rate of decline. There was just no sound operating model to
pursue that would have covered the cost of labor and food, while still maintaining the level of service to
the community. The department will be assessing every operating profile in every location to ensure it’s
not operating at a loss. 
In a typical year, the Food Service Department is fully self-funded and does not have an impact on the
operating budget. In FY21, operating funds were needed to cover staff salaries as revenues
significantly decreased due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

BUILDING AND GROUNDS
The Office of Buildings and Grounds department employs 70 custodians, a custodial supervisor, 9
maintenance personnel, five office support staff, a maintenance foreman and a director. This
department currently maintains 16 school-owned buildings comprising 1,655,076 square feet of building
space and 265 acres of grounds, including athletic playing fields, paved driveways, walkways, parking
lots and wooded areas. The department objectives are as follows: adhere to safety and health
standards, provide cleaning and maintenance inside and outside of building structures, ensure security
of buildings, plan for and monitor efficient use of buildings, and provide year-round maintenance of
grounds and in addition to routine maintenance and cleaning of all buildings, the Office of Buildings and
Grounds oversees and coordinates the following: All applicable federal, state, local and district
inspections including City of Framingham building inspections, fire alarm inspections and elevator
inspections, which are performed annually. 
We are pleased to report we are working with the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) in
building a new Fuller Middle School with a scheduled opening in 2021. We have contracted TBA
Architects to perform a Pre-Feasibility study for the Hemenway School to determine if it would be more
feasible to renovate or replace the school at its current location or to find another location for a new
Hemenway School. We anticipate submitting a Statement of Interest to Massachusetts School Building
Authority in 2021 for a new elementary school located south of Route 9. 
In FY20, the schools have had significant repairs done that have prolonged their useful life. The
district has a 20-year Capital Plan for all of its schools and we are guided by that plan as well as by
the conditions that exist or emerge in our buildings. The district has been supported in its efforts to
maintain and upgrade all of our buildings through the City's Capital Budget process. The Capital
Budget for the schools has allowed the district to maintain our buildings. The majority of the
buildings are 50 years old or older that have not been renovated. 
In FY21, it is important to note that a long-term 20-year capital facilities plan is utilized in planning
for the future needs in the District. However, nearing the end of the FY20, the COVID-19 pandemic
arrived and made it difficult to maintain our buildings on an “as usual” daily schedule basis. We had
to switch gears to a series of mandated state guidelines for special sanitizing spray cleaning for the
buildings, PPE (protective personnel equipment) to make sure the spread of COVID-19 virus was
prevented in all ways possible when staff and students arrived back into the buildings. Along with
this added work, we will continue to follow the long range plan and request funding for Capital
projects that require priority status such as exterior envelope, paving/stormwater, and roofs that will
allow us to continue to maintain and upgrade our buildings. This year's FY21 Capital Budget request
was appropriated for $3,605,000. This allowed us to continue our efforts to keep our buildings safe, 
sound and functional. 
In the beginning of FY22, we will be relocating the remaining staff out from Fuller Middle as the
demolition of that building is due to begin in early July 2021. The New Fuller Middle School building

is in its final stages of completion and everyone is excited for its grand opening in the fall. Two new
artificial turf fields have been requested and approved through the FY22 Capital Budget for
installation behind the new school. This new facility will be a gem for the Southside of the City and
for the entire community.

TRANSPORTATION
In a typical year, the Transportation department operates, in collaboration with a bus vendor, seventy-
seven school buses transporting approximately 6,500-7,000 students per day. Buses carry out over 360
runs that cover 3,400 live miles and operate on a three-tiered routing system (elementary then middle
then high school). The District services twenty-three schools including public, private and parochial
schools per state law. Estimated bus fees to be collected in a fiscal year are approximately $300,000 and
are used to offset transportation operating costs. Staffing consists of a Director, an Assistant Director, 
two dispatchers and two administrative assistants. The fleet consists of 77 buses with several buses
parked at a CSX lot at a cost of $38,265 for FY22. The department’s routing software includes the
Edutracker package, which allows a parent/guardian access to the Edulog Parent Portal Lite to view the
location of their child’s bus in real time on their smart phone. Edulog also assists the District in route
data analysis to allow optimization for scheduling and routing buses. 
School year 2020-2021 has been like no other due to the pandemic, and the transportation
department has been hard at work to route the Districts cohort S, cohort B and cohort A students. The
department intends to pivot to schedule bus routes for the in-person return of Elementary students
on April 5th and Middle School students on April 28th. 
The major cost for the FY22 school year in this department is the home to school transportation
contract with NRT Bus Inc. that will be in year one of five in FY22. NRT Bus is a new large school bus
vendor to Framingham and the District looks forward to a collaborative partnership. The first year of
the contract will cost the District $6,006,100, a decrease of $115,184 compared to the FY21 school
bus contracted amount.

TECHNOLOGY
The Office of Technology is responsible for providing a technical foundation to support the District's
Strategic Plan and maintain an advanced learning environment for the 21st century student and
educator. Our focus is to provide seamless access to digital resources, to integrate technology into the
curriculum of the Framingham Public School district, and to assist the learning community through
efficient processes and training. The Office of Technology oversees and supports technology across 17
sites, supports 1,600 district staff members, 9,000 students, and many of the community and after-
school programs. We provide a wide breadth of support for technical issues, security and networking, 
data and analytics, state reporting, digital curriculum support, staff professional development. 
The focus of the department over the past year has been to support remote, hybrid and in person
learning. The staff needed to be flexible and pivot to meet the needs of students and families across the
district. This involved major changes to infrastructure, rolling out 1:1 chromebooks and developing
professional development for new tools for teachers. 
For Fiscal Year 2021-2022, the Office of Technology will continue to support the 1:1 chromebook
initiative and more clearly define the policy and process to support this program. We will also continue
our focus on data. Numerous data initiatives were needed this year to support our students. This work
will need to continue to expand in the next year.

SPECIAL EDUCATION
Currently there are 2,108 students receiving special education services, including therapy only, partial
inclusion, full inclusion and substantially separate. In addition to services by special educators, we also
provide speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, adaptive physical
education, orientation and mobility, visual impairment support, applied behavior analyst support and
audiological consultation. Below is a snapshot of our special education students as of March 2, 2021: 
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  40

In reflecting on FY21, preschool growth, compliance and program expansion were areas that lead to
unanticipated costs. From 2016-2020, BLOCKS Preschool has added four half day sections of our Autism
program and three half day sections of inclusion programs, along with staffing to support those
classrooms. Specifically, FY20 was the third year in a row that an additional classroom needed to be
added mid year. The number of preschool students requiring specialized programming for Autism
Spectrum Disorders (ASD) is on the rise. We had twenty two students ready to enter Kindergarten in
FY21 requiring a specialized ASD classroom. In order to support our incoming students, we identified
that two additional classes needed to be added; one at King Elementary School and one at Brophy
Elementary School. We also had a plan to expand our program for students with multiple disabilities and
start a program at Framingham High school. Both our programs for students with Autism and our
programs for students with multiple disabilities require a low teacher student ratio and specialized
support from related service providers. 
For Fiscal Year21, this year is very unique due to COVID-19. The guidance from the Department of
Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE), required our department to hold COVID-19 Compensatory
Meetings (starting with our “high needs” students) to evaluate the impact on the school closure from
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  41
Page 42
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
March-June in FY20 and review the student’s individual progress towards attaining their goals. If it was
determined that we owe COVID Compensatory Services (CCS), we should make every effort to provide
them immediately. The DESE did provide some grant funds (approximately $60,000) that we are able to
use to provide these supports and, as a result, there is very little impact on the operating budget this
year. It is unclear, however, if we will be directed to do the same process for CCS next year as a result of
this current school year. It is also unclear if we will have access to the grant again next year to cover the
cost of these CCS services. Therefore, there is potential for unanticipated costs next year as a result of
COVID-19 and the limited in person learning that has occurred. Another challenge, as a result of the
pandemic, is staffing. The Special Education Department has had openings all year that we can’t fill. In
order to maintain compliance, we have had to reach out to agencies to contract services such as BCBA, 
ABA, SLP, and paraprofessionals. 
For Fiscal Year 2021, Expanding our program for students with multiple disabilities has been a huge
success and something we are very proud of. Up until five years ago, students who needed this level of
support entering 6th grade were sent to an out of district placement. The students and families are
benefiting from staying in our community and having access to the necessary services in the least
restrictive environment. As a result of our program expansion, our physical therapy needs have
increased. Many students in the program require direct physical therapy services and support. We
currently have one Physical Therapist and one Physical Therapy Assistant servicing the district. In order
to maintain compliance and provide the services, an additional Physical Therapist will be added. 
Additional staffing will be required and a second ASD classroom at Brophy Elementary School will be
added to manage the second year in a row of having more than 20 incoming Kindergartners requiring a
specialized ASD classroom. As a district, we need to begin long term planning for our ASD programming, 
including looking at the current schools that house the program, reviewing the elementary to middle
school feeder pattern, and considering expanding the program to an additional middle school. Our
middle school ASD program is at Fuller Middle School and currently there is one classroom. When the
new Fuller planning began, we projected a second classroom would be needed. If we have a third year in
a row with twenty incoming Kindergarten students requiring an ASD classroom, Fuller will eventually
need 6 classrooms for this program. The biggest barrier we have in program expansion continues to be
the lack of additional space in our current school buildings. To note, Special Education legal costs are
included in this budget and the District utilizes several different firms for District legal matters and are as
follows: The City Solicitor (Petrini & Associates, P.C.), (open meeting law, policy review, municipal leases, 
payroll), Morgan, Brown & Joy, LLP (employment, human resources, collective bargaining) and Benjamin
& White P.C. (Special Education and civil rights).

COMMUNITY RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT
The Office of Community Resource Development (CRD) oversees before school, after school, non-
school days, vacation weeks, summer programming, Framingham High School Daycare, and Flyers by
Night. Additionally, the Office oversees over 35 community partnerships working within the schools
and programs featured in the [URL: "https://www.renniecenter.org/sites/default/files/Condition%20of%20Education%202021%20ActionGuide.pdf"] Condition of Education Report. 
Our Pre-K and Elementary program, called Explorers, is a robust before and after school program. The
program is focused on Project Based Learning integrating STEAM and Social-Emotional Learning. 
Explorers is a fee-based program, accepting vouchers and scholarships. Explorers has been featured on
 CBS Boston and the [URL: "https://www.metrowestdailynews.com/news/20200422/framingham-public-schools-launches-expanded-online-enrichment-program"] MetroWest Daily News. 
Flyers After School (FAS), our Middle School programs, typically see over 800 students for in-person
clubs such as Black Student Union, Dance, Dungeons and Dragons, Gender Sexuality Alliance, Key Club, 
Leadership Council, Robotics, Student Immigration Movement, and many more (clubs vary by school).
This year we were successfully awarded a 21st Century Community Learning Center (21st CCLC) grant at
Walsh Middle School. This model is our first ever to provide academic credit for successful participation. 
CRD will be applying for 21st CCLC funding for Fuller and Cameron Middle Schools in the Spring of 2021. 
At the High School level, students sign up independently for a variety of clubs offered after school such
as Yearbook, Robotics, Poetry and Literacy, Debate, Student Immigration Movement, Environmental
Awareness, and more. During the summer, CRD oversees The Summer Institute, providing credit
recovery and original credit opportunities for students. 
The vision of Out of School Time (OST) expansion is to grow access and equity for students beyond the
bell. Nationally, OST programs are shown to have efficacy with student attendance, discipline, family
engagement, and more. The programs work tirelessly to ensure student accommodations for all
behaviors by connecting with the school day staff, families, and community partners. As a
department, we are projected to service approximately 3000 students during the 2021-2022 school
year.

ADULT ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE (ADULT ESL) 
Framingham Adult ESL Plus (FAESL+) is one the few adult education programs in the area to provide free
and comprehensive programming for Limited English Speaking adults. The program provides AM and PM
ESL, High School Equivalency, and Citizenship preparation classes, along with robust advising services. 
We offer 47 classes from beginner to transition to college. FAESL+ serves over 750 students each
semester with countless more waiting. Due to safety concerns, we have not been able to hold an open
public lottery over the last year, and we expect large turnout when we do our next open public lottery
due to pent-up demand. 84% of our funding comes from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary
and Secondary Education, Adult and Community Learning Services division. 8% comes from public grants
and corporate and private donations, and 8% comes from Framingham Public Schools. 
Our Spring 2021 students come from 40 countries and speak 28 different languages. Students range in
age from 18 to 80 years old, with an average age of 41 years old. 68% of our students are female, and
the majority work more than one job. Our adult learners are parents of 272 FPS students. 
FAESL+ reinvented itself in 2020. On Thursday, March 12th 2020, we stopped in-person classes due to
COVID-19; by the following Thursday we began instruction at a distance. We have used dozens of online
tools and held over 1,000 hours of professional development to create the best possible online learning
experience for our students. Many of the changes we have instituted during the pandemic add value
and will continue. Our online learning allows us to meet our students' needs and fulfill our program’s
mission with greater flexibility than ever before. We wish we had not been forced to remake ourselves
in the face of the pandemic, but we are discovering many silver linings. 
Our student retention has been remarkable. As we start our Spring 2021 Semester, 11 months after we
shutdown, 85% of our students have stayed with us (at a time when most programs in other
communities have lost between 40 and 70% of their students). We have oriented students who were
already on our Active Waiting List, and we begin the Spring 2021 semester fully enrolled. Our work is
more crucial than ever. The pandemic has knocked everyone down, but some need more help in getting
back up. Communities of color have been particularly impacted by this crisis, and these residents need
fluency, literacy, numeracy, and technological skills to join the recovering economy. The need for free
ESL classes is crucial to the economic recovery of these communities and of the City of Framingham. 
Through their participation in English as a Second Language classes, students will improve their skills
while they develop a better understanding of U.S. culture and customs. These positive results bolster
students' self-esteem, improve their job opportunities, increase their participation in their children's
education, and their investment in our community. 
In addition to free classes, we provide our students with access to as many wraparound services as
possible. Our teachers and student advisors have experience helping students navigate systems that
help their whole families to succeed and we reach out to our community partners to bring in resources
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  44

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
when needed. For example, we continue to provide our students with free consultations with an
immigration attorney, thanks to Massa Viana Law. Through 2020, we provided counseling with licensed
bilingual mental health professionals, thanks to a grant from MetroWest Health Foundation, and we
have taken the lessons learned and resources uncovered during this project to create a training for all
FAESL+ staff. We have an advisor stationed with the MassHire Metro Southwest Career Center to help
align adult education and Career Services across the Metro Southwest region. 
FAESL+ is a leader in adult education programs in Massachusetts and has built a reputation of providing
high quality Adult Basic Education and ESL instruction over the past 37 years. The program consistently
meets or exceeds the standards set by The Massachusetts Department of Education for Indicators of
Program Quality. Special projects such as volunteer groups, student advisory councils, resource guides, 
and guest speakers create fresh and stimulating programming and keep students returning in large
numbers. But the impact of FAESL+ extends far beyond the 750 students who attend our classes. Our
adult students are parents of children in most of the Framingham Public Schools. 
We know the value of community connections. FAESL+, along with the United Way of Tri-County, 
convenes Framingham Community Partners, pulling together dozens of local social service agencies on
topics of interest and creating a valuable Network opportunity. The program also helps at a state level, 
with members of its administrative team sitting on the MassHire MSW Board, Framingham Housing
Authority, Jewish Family Service, and providing PD through the SABES Network. The director is also the
co-chair of the statewide Directors’ Council, keeping FAESL+ at the center of state policy for Adult
Education. The program partnered in a research study with the Harvard Center for Education Policy
Research on the public benefit of publicly-funded adult education. This research, presented on
2/24/2021 to the FPS School Committee, showed the robust and direct social and financial results of
students being in an FAESL+ class. While the demand for classes vastly outstrips the supply, FAESL+ 
works hard to be available and accountable to the community. Our social media coordinator keeps a
timely flow of information to thousands of followers on our Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter accounts, 
and we keep contact with our alumni to continually be of service. 
All of our sites are accessible, and we believe that we are ethically responsible to serve all enrolled
students qualified under our ABE charter from the Department of Education. For example, in response
to COVID-19, we have begun offering remote instruction. Our services are scaffolded and have bilingual
support staff to help get students online. But for those who lack technological literacy, we are
establishing an alternate tutoring-at-a-distance program for those who lack the literacy or technical skills
to participate in our online classes. 
We thank the Framingham Public Schools School Committee for all of the support they provide our
program and, in turn, to our students.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION
The Physical Education Department's goal is to educate minds, develop healthy bodies, promote
positive attitudes towards fitness, physical activity and sports skills. The Department has developed
a Peer Observation matrix that has been vetted by the Office of Teaching and Learning, which
allows everyone in the department one professional day to visit and observe colleagues in other
buildings. The department recently completed an update of the K-5 PE curriculum and is workingon reorganizing and rewriting the grade 6-8 PE and health curriculums. The Physical Education
Department has made significant strides and will continue to do so through this coming school
year. The Department, through a collaboration with the Business, has streamlined the supply
ordering process, learned and implemented Munis, and has established a basis of needs in terms of
supplies and programming for K-8. 
It was exciting to be able to create and be given the authority to manage the Health and PE
budgets. There was a slight learning curve involved, but after working with the Business Office and
learning Munis, supply ordering became even more efficient and streamlined. Also, this past year
has been helpful in establishing a basis of need, in terms of supplies and programming, for the K-8
department. This assessment will be an ongoing process. 
The Health and PE Department continues to operate in three tiers, elementary, middle, and high
school. Grades K-8 is overseen by a Department Head and grades 9-12 is overseen by another
Department Head however, we consider ourselves a K-12 department. Our vision remains the
same, expose students to as many opportunities as possible, provide students with important
health and fitness knowledge, and foster a positive culture within our classes that teaches life skills
and perseverance. 
Budgetarily, it has been a pleasure working with everyone in the Business Office, and we feel fully
supported. The purchasing process has been much easier the second year going through the
process. It is very helpful to have control of the supply budget specifically. As needs arise
throughout the school year, they can be addressed fairly quickly. In regards to PD, it has been
somewhat of a challenge to plan and access certain professional development opportunities based
on two factors. First, the fact that most of the full day PD days were scheduled in the fall (2019),
lining up and planning days so close together was challenging. Secondly and separately, the district
procedure that disallows teachers to access PD opportunities on Mondays and Fridays severely
limits the Health and PE department, as there are limited PD opportunities to begin with, and
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  46
Page 47
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
many PD’s for Health and PE teachers fall on Mondays and Fridays. The hope is that policy can be
changed as subs become more readily available to the district. 
Scheduling and staffing are a huge focus and constant concern. At the elementary level, working in
conjunction with the Office of Teaching and Learning and Assistant Superintendent Amy Bright, 
scheduling changes were implemented. The intent was to create an equitable schedule across all
nine elementary schools. This year was considered a pilot year. An SEL (social emotional learning) 
block was added to allow schools to pinpoint specific needs of higher risk students and provide
targeted support during these SEL blocks. 
As a result of the schedule changes, at this point, there are no itinerant teachers (teaching at more
than one school). At the middle school level, scheduling is consistent across all three schools. An
additional enrichment/connections/advisory block was added in the morning to each schedule. 
The challenge in regards to scheduling at both the elementary and middle school levels is equity in
teaching load and class size across all schools. It is a consistent goal of the department to attract
and retain quality teachers. The record will show, over the past five years, that we have been
successful in achieving this goal. 
A Health and PE Website has been added to the Department list on the Framingham District
Homepage. Inter-departmental collaboration has been a goal of the department for many years. 
In the Fall, in collaboration with Sarah DeLuca, Stacey Cugini, Mynette Shifman, Cheryl Aglio-Girelli, 
and the Office of Health and Wellness, many Health and PE staff had the opportunity to attend a
full day mindfulness professional development at Open Spirit in Framingham. Also, a partnership
with the Food Services department has been developed, where Middle School Health classes have
had Framingham State interns, who are overseen by Raquel Hammond, present tastings to 6th
grade students at all three middle schools during the nutrition unit. At the same time, the Food
Services “Harvest of the Month '' program is being promoted through the tasting presentations. 
The two departments are working together to enhance the experience for all involved. We are
excited to continue this partnership, and we are exploring opportunities to expand the
relationship. 
The purchase of 30 Polar GoFit OH1 Heart rate monitors has been approved and will be piloted at
some schools (yet to be determined). It is a distinct possibility that more units will be purchased in
the future. The Office of Technology has agreed to provide a compatible iPhone to aid in the
facilitation of the Polar GoFit pilot. 
Going forward the goal of the department is to continue to build positive relationships with
students and continue to help build our students into responsible, accountable, young adults. We
also will continue our goal and vision of remaining a unified K-12 department. As department
heads, we plan to continue our collaboration with other district departments, in a variety of
initiatives and collective interests. Two goals going forward include continued refinement and work
with the Office of Teaching and Learning to ensure that any inequities and inconsistencies within
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  47

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
the elementary, middle, and high school schedules are addressed and improved upon. Also, in
conjunction with this goal, class sizes (ever growing) are carefully monitored and assessed to
ensure the best possible experience for all students at each school. Departmentally, for K-8, a goal
moving forward is to find a way to have meaningful departmental meeting time implemented
throughout the school year, other than full day PD days. Without departmental meetings
throughout the year, it is difficult to ensure that certain messages are being heard and understood
at all schools. Also, finding meaningful and engaging professional development opportunities is
always a goal of the department heads. We look forward to the future and continue to put our
collective best foot forward. 
The 2019-2020 school year started like any other. We continued to explore curriculum options and
partnerships we had started in previous school years (see above). However, the pandemic totally
changed everything. From March to June, the Health and PE Department, like all other
departments, tried to provide physical education and health education options and guidance for
our students. The fact that we were not in school, nor had meaningful class meetings with
students, severely limited what we could provide for students. We ended the school year hoping
that we could get back to a sense of normalcy for the start of the 2020/2021 school year. 
The start of the 2020-2021 school unfortunately did not usher in the normalcy we all had hoped
for. We again were teaching remotely and we were having a hard time as a District and
Department determining how to best instruct our students, as we now needed to figure out how
to translate our curriculum to the virtual format. This was a huge chore and a cause of great
concern and anxiety for all involved. Both the Health and Physical Education curriculums were a
challenge to morph, and both curriculums suffered and continue to suffer during this time. The
Physical Education curriculum was the most challenging to adapt, as this curriculum relies heavily
on equipment and space. The hope was, that when students were allowed back into school, we
could get back to a more “normal” and authentic teaching style. Again, this was not to be. Now, as
I write this, we are still overcoming challenges, namely “simultaneous teaching,” where teachers
need to teach students that are in person and remote at the same time. We are continuing to
explore the best way to go about this nearly impossible task. We are continuing to adapt and
overcome as a department. Throughout all of this I have been very impressed with the resilience
and dedication my staff has shown. We are looking forward to a 2021/2022 school year that will
allow us an opportunity to again teach Health and PE as it should be taught. 
There will be a certain amount of “catch up” in the 2021-2022 school year that will have to play as
we return next year. We as a department are looking forward to this opportunity. We will re-
establish our baseline for student expectations, continue to develop positive relationships with
students, and from there, move forward in advancing the Health and PE curriculums.

ATHLETICS
The Framingham Athletic Department is a continued source of pride for the people of the City of
Framingham. Due to the volume of events and publicity we receive, athletics is often considered the
most publicly recognized department in the school district. We are determined to provide our student
athletes with a great experience representing the City. Our athletic teams reflect the positive values
they have learned growing up in Framingham. Our athletes represent us with poise, class, and
distinction throughout the school year. Our teams reflect the richness of diversity in Framingham and
our athletes become better people with guidance from our teacher coaches. For many of our students, 
athletics is the central factor in better attendance, improved behavior, higher grades, and greater
overall participation in their school community. Framingham is a well-recognized sports community, 
and many of our teams are recognized as perennial challengers for league and state wide
accomplishments. The Department has four full time employees that manage and support roughly 150
part time coaches and roughly 1,500 athletes. Athletics works in close coordination with all other
departments in the City of Framingham. Your Framingham Athletic Department has an excellent
reputation both within the City and throughout the state. 
The pandemic of this past year presented a variety of challenges and we were asked to redefine our
roles while remaining at the ready for when we could safely return to play. Throughout the fall we
were charged with a variety of responsibilities varying from delivering hotspots and Chromebooks to
scanning books for academic departments. Our staff remained engaged with MIAA and League
officials to be ready for return to play and had knowledge of all protocols. We had planned for a fall
season and eventually had to cancel. We then planned a winter season only to have to cancel that as
well. In the meantime we continued to help with anything we were asked to do, monitored all the
virtual work our coaches were doing, and worked with district officials to keep our students as
engaged as we could under the circumstances. We turned our efforts to a few long term projects and
did a complete and full equipment inventory, had our gym floor restored, and planned for the Fall II
season. At long last the Fall II season is underway and we are currently running 19 sports at this time. 
The level of effort the Athletic Department staff and coaches have put in to make this happen has
been inspiring. Running 19 sports in a normal year would require a Herculean effort but add in all the
required modifications, weather obstacles, transportation problems, and it makes it that much
harder. Thanks to the offers of our coaches, cooperation of our parents, and support of central office
administration, we are making it work.

Our vision moving forward is to continually improve and foster a positive culture within all of our
programs projecting a positive image of our teams for the citizens of Framingham. We continue to
work closely with our youth sports groups to create strong feeder programs that will keep our most
talented young people wanting to play their sport at Framingham High School. We are working to
enhance our current facilities and create awareness throughout the City for our needs such as
additional turf fields, gym space, or a community athletic center.

SAGE GIFTED AND TALENTED
The SAGE Department is composed of students in the 2nd-8th grades who have qualified through
various screening measures. The Sage department has 8 staff members that service nine elementary
schools and three middle schools. In grades 2-5, students go to pull-out classes once a week for 1 1/2
hours and work on activities and projects that include STEAM, ELA, and Social Studies. Students also
benefit from the SAGE teacher pushing into the regular classroom to offer enrichment or other
activities. Our middle school students have pull-out classes to work on projects or enrichment for
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  50
Page 51
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
subjects such as Math and ELA. They also benefit from having the SAGE teachers pushing into their
Math, Science, and ELA classes. 
This year in SAGE we did a lot of awesome things, and as a team we stretched our minds and challenged
our students. We have started an innovation project with all of our students, to make our schools and
the City of Framingham more green. Each school has chosen projects that their SAGE students are
interested in with the emphasis on “going green.” At the start of this project, the SAGE students at each
of our elementary schools wrote letters to Mayor Spicer, Representative Robinson, and Mr. Shawn Luz
and asked them what they think the biggest environmental need is in Framingham. From this we will be
doing projects to find solutions to some of these problems. We are also purchasing robot kits for each
elementary school so that they can use the robots to help solve these problems as well as get the
students interested in robotics. Working with the robots will also develop the skills needed for robotics
in middle and high school. 
This year we are also starting a new screening process to be able to identify a larger demographic of
students. Starting this Spring, we will be doing online testing using the CogAT cognitive test. Not only
will this program be less biased, it will take our testing time from 2-3 months to 24 hours. We will also
be able to test an entire class of students at the same time. Our teachers are receiving professional
development on how to administer the test. 
We sent out a SAGE newsletter to the entire community that will be published three times a year. We
also had a Puzzle Night on January 29th to celebrate National Puzzle Day for the community and had
well over 200 people. This will become an annual event. For the coming year we are going to be doing
universal screening for all 1st grade students in the district. By doing this we can reach students that
may never be identified using the previous tests. We would also like to be able to add more robots and
other STEAM related materials so that our students can get a firm grasp of robotics and STEAM in
general.

PARENT INFORMATION CENTER 
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic which first affected Massachusetts in March 2020, the Parent
Information Center (PIC) was able to quickly develop a plan to ensure remote registration for families. 
From March 13, 2020 to June 30, 2020 PIC registered 342 students, hosted virtual Kindergarten tours, 
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  51
Page 52
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
and shifted paper forms to online forms. Further access was created for families by providing PIC staff
members with district cell phones so that parents could contact them during school business hours. 
From July 1, 2020 to March 2, 2021 951 students were registered. 
In the summer of 2021, the Parent Information Center will be transitioning into the Farley Building. 
The building lies adjacent to the new Fuller Middle School across from McCarthy Elementary School. 
Located on the first floor of Farley, parents will be greeted by a receptionist who will guide them to the
seated waiting area. The Parent Information Center (PIC), will expand student registration to include
more services to serve the holistic needs of families. Families will meet with a case manager to assess
each family's basic needs and connect them to appropriate services to ensure a smooth transition into
Framingham. Families in need of emergency food, school supplies or clothing will be accompanied to
our Welcome Center Resource Room. The room will be maintained by district staff and community
partners. It will be fully stocked with new clothing, shoes and school supplies. Daniel’s Table will keep
it fully stocked with dry foods and frozen family size meals. The Welcome Center will house a
community office where community partners such as Mass Hire, SMOC and the Edward Kennedy
Center and more will be able to set up remote office hours to facilitate greater access for families. 
As we look to FY22 we are preparing for life post COVID. That includes community hours for PIC that
would allow for student registration during evening hours and on weekends in target areas within the
community. These sessions will take place during high enrollment times throughout the year helping to
ease access for families while lessening the number of families registering during the week.

FINE AND PERFORMING ARTS
The Fine and Performing Arts in the Framingham Public Schools is a jewel in the crown of our
educational programming for our kids. Framingham has shown that it values the arts as a part of a
comprehensive education. Our theatre program, our instrumental music program, our brand new
dance program and our visual arts programs are some of the best in the state. The theatre program
is used as an exemplar in other communities. Even in our virtual year our students and teachers were
recognized for excellence in several areas of arts education. 
The request this year represents the need to continue with our Quaver curriculum subscription for K-5
music along with a subscription for a curriculum to address social emotional learning through the arts. 
Quaver is an online music curriculum resource which is the foundation of our K-5 curriculum. This

subscription and the accompanying technology ensures that all students in the district are receiving
the same high quality music experience. The request also includes a request for a Coordinator of Fine
and Performing Arts at Central office and additional funding to support our highly successful marching
band which continues to grow and now rehearses throughout the school year.

Equitable per student formula for elementary and middle school arts funding has
provided a “like” arts experience for all students in Framingham. 
As a result of cost center ordering we have saved between 30% and 50% in discounts
from at least two of our biggest vendors. This savings allowed us to outfit every music
classroom with “standard” equipment and to provide art supplies at a per student
allowance which insured equity at all schools and relieved the PTO’s from supporting
curriculum related materials. 
The String program is now at three elementary schools and 30 string instruments were
purchased to start this program and 20 more this past year. We now need at least 20
additional instruments as the program grows. 
An FHS student was selected for the Massachusetts Music Educators Association all
state festival once again. 
An FHS student came in 1st place in the state wide Massachusetts Educational Theatre
Guild’s monologue scholarship audition. 
Two FHS students took first place in the METG scene partner contest. 
An FHS student took a first place slot in the new Musical Theatre Contest sponsored by
METG. 
Our Visual Arts students participated in Youth Art Month and the Globe Scholastic and
were recognized with gold and silver keys in Photography and Visual Art. 
Our grade five band program serves 70% of all grade five students in the district. 
Our three middle schools and our high school have vibrant and successful after school
theatre programs. 
In conjunction with Community Resource and Development, we will offer our third year
of summer theatre programming for our students. The enrollment has grown from 23 to

EARLY EDUCATION
The Early Childhood Alliance of Framingham (ECAF) is dedicated to promoting and supporting the
healthy growth and development of young children prenatal through age 8 by strengthening families
and advocating for high quality learning experiences. 
The Alliance is made up of a host of community agencies in partnership with the district with a focus on
ensuring access to early learning experiences for children prenatal through age 8, school readiness, early
childhood resources, and professional development for early childhood educators. 
The Early Childhood Alliance provides access to: 
■  Signature Play, Learn, and Grow Together Groups
■  Internationally Recognized ParentChild+ Home Visitation Program 
(For eligible families with children age 18 to 36 months old) 
■  Family Education & Support
■  Ages & Stage Parent Questionnaire 
■  Resource & Referral Services
■  Resource Guide for Early Education
■  Transition Support
■  Family & Community Leadership Opportunities
■  And More! 
Community Outreach, Resource and Referrals
● Transition Support – connecting your family to early intervention, preschool, kindergarten, 
special education, and out-of-school time. 
● KinderWait Entry – assistance in accessing financial assistance for child care. 
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  55
Page 56
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
● Resource Guide for Early Childhood – inside this booklet you will find information on choosing
child care, child care programs and preschools, preparing your child for Kindergarten, and
helpful community resources. 
Signature Play, Learn and Grow Together Groups, Family Education and Support, Home Visitation, and
Ages and Stages Parent Questionnaire (ASQ) 
● PLAY, LEARN, AND GROW TOGETHER (PLGT): This is play-based learning that has something
for every young learner. We will imagine, create, sing, and read as we explore the different
brain building zones. After all learning is not only fun, but it is the gift that keeps giving! The
Passport to Kindergarten curriculum includes the following overarching themes: the three
literacy areas- Early Literacy, Social Emotional Learning, and Financial Literacy; STREAM; 
Brain Building in Progress/School Readiness; and Summer Learning. 
● HOT TOPIC/BABY TALK/HEALTH SERIES/OUTDOOR EDUCATION: These family education
groups are perfect for the parent to have weekly discussions on common topics such as
feeding, sleep, health, child development, and more. 
● LET’S GO TO KINDERGARTEN: This group is geared toward the family with a 3-5 year old who
wants to learn school readiness skills in a play-based environment. 
● DADS AND DISCOVERIES: This group is a great way to connect with other dads and their
families. We will sing songs, discover new learning activities, read a story and more. This
group is open to all families, especially for children from birth to 6 years old. 
● PJ FAMILY STORY HOUR: This evening monthly group is for the whole family that highlights
the importance of bedtime routines. 
● PARENTCHILD + PLUS HOME VISITATION PROGRAM (formerly PCHP): is a home-based early
literacy program that provides families with weekly home visits by a trained home visitor
who brings educational books and toys as gifts to the family. ParentChild + is open to eligible
families with children 18-36 months. 
● AGES & STAGES PARENT QUESTIONNAIRE (ASQ) - an opportunity to learn more about child
development and how your child is growing and learning. Another tool to honor the parent
as their child’s first and most important advocate and teacher. 
Leadership Opportunities
● ECAF Leadership Council - Parents, community organization representatives, and early childhood
educators meet to discuss program initiatives and priorities, set the direction for ECAF activities, 
and networking opportunities. 
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  56
Page 57
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
● Action Team Involvement – Members participate in defining tasks for specific program activities
such as community outreach, volunteer recruitment, events, marketing, and fundraising. 
The work is led by Jane Cohen, the ECAF Program Coordinator. All positions are funded by the
Massachusetts Department of Early Education and Care Coordinated Family and Community
Engagement grant program, administered by the Framingham Public Schools, and kindly supported by
community partners. As the district looks to expand access to early education, ECAF offers the perfect
foundation to build off of. In FY20, Joseph Corazzini, Assistant Superintendent of Equity, Diversity and
Community Development, requested that ECAF be established as a department. The department would
provide support to help expand our Pre-K work. A modest first budget of $10,041 to cover some
supplies is the first step in our effort to expand our Pre-K work. The budget in FY21 was increased to
$16,015. We continue to be delighted to be an official department of the Framingham Public Schools to
lend our early childhood parent child education programming both in group and in home settings, and, 
family and community engagement expertise that embeds authentic strengthening based practices at
the earliest point in the families’ introduction to early education and family support. 
The 2019-2020 year went well given the pandemic. We rose to the challenges of the pandemic and
nationally home visiting programs were the first to develop virtual best practices in response to the
COVID-19 affecting every community. We gathered our community partners and worked together to
support one another and listen to the pressing needs. We provided over 40 pre-recorded programs to
families focused on early literacy and school readiness. We offered over 70 live Zoom parent child
group programs with over 300 families with 425 children under the age of 5 fully engaged. The
internationally recognized ParentChild+ early literacy and school readiness home visitation program
serves 20 families impacting 37 children. These families tend to be more isolated, immigrants, live at the
poverty level, and may have a special need. 
During the current 2020-2021 school year we have consistently without pause continued programming
and improved as we furthered providing the programs. Our Leadership Council stayed strong and
together offered one another support and guidance. Outreach to families is the biggest challenge due to
COVID-19 and no in person contact. However we rely on partners and the schools to refer families with
young children to us. Outreach within the schools is critical as the students have young siblings that
could benefit from our programs at the earliest point and prior to entering the schools formally. 
Prevention at its best! A shortfall was stable technology for staff, as Early Learning Specialists need
reliable computers, laptops preferred. Turnover of families was common due to the transient times due
to the pandemic. Yet we were able to continue recruiting families for our menu of programs especially
the ParentChild+ program. Again having partner support is critical as well as having access to the
centralized child care waitlist. 
For the 2021-2022 school year, we look forward to continuing to build the early childhood division
department and are ready to support any efforts, challenges, and achievements of the district and city. 
We are hopeful that the Department of Early Education and Care will continue the Coordinated Family
and Community Engagement (CFCE) grant and the Governor will continue to recognize these essential
proactive, prevention early identification programs as key to future learning successes for all students

and families. However, the budgets are extremely limited in these grants. Staff are underpaid compared
to similar district positions and all staff are highly trained with early education and home visiting
backgrounds, skills and abilities as well as social work. Sustainability is important and by embedding in
the district plan recognizes this work as essential to the mission, vision, and goals of the Framingham
Public Schools.

LIBRARY MEDIA
The mission of the FPS Libraries is to provide equitable resources and opportunities to all members of
the FPS community by supporting learners in their journey toward their unique passions, becoming
critically thinking, responsible and literate citizens in order to meet the information needs of their life
and work. The FPS Libraries will modernize the print and digital library collections across the district in
order to provide equitable access to all students, support content area instruction, nurture a culture of
independent reading, build a program that ensures every student attains the Massachusetts Digital
Literacy Standards essential for college and career readiness, and build a library culture of independent, 
student-led inquiry. 
In 2019-2020, FPS Libraries circulated 91,787 books to FPS’s students and staff, until the March 2020
shutdown. The libraries also increased print materials in languages other than English; they are now
available in every FPS Library, primarily in Spanish and Portuguese, with a dedicated budget line to fund
the growth of these collections. High circulation in these collections demonstrated a continued strong
need to supply this increasing demand. The district has made great strides toward building a program
that ensures every student masters the Digital Literacy and Computer Science skills essential for college
and career readiness. These skills largely overlap with the kind of Information Literacy skills that have
long been the staple of Library Media Specialists’ curriculum and teaching. At the K-5 level, the Library
Media teachers expanded the Digital Literacy Skills curriculum, including units in Media Balance, Online
Safety, Digital Research Skills, and Coding. At FHS, the Library Media Specialist oversaw the creation of
the AP Capstone program, a two-course series teaching research, information organization and
presentation skills and promotes curiosity-driven independent learning and critical-thinking. At the
middle schools the full staffing of libraries with media specialists allowed for more comprehensive
instruction of research skills at all three schools. The librarians collaborated with core content area
teachers to implement curriculum based inquiry projects and teach students critical skills like targeted
searching and documenting sources. During the spring 2020 asynchronous learning period, Library
Media Specialists quickly pivoted to create lessons that focused on accessing and using digital resources, 
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  58

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
and Library Media Specialists provided remote professional development to grade level teams on digital
resources and information literacy skills development. 
In 2020-2021, the FPS Library Media Specialists helped the district to employ a digital curriculum model, 
including ebooks and digital resources for remote/hybrid learning. The increased use of digital tools and
the need for digital citizenship among K-12 students has highlighted the crucial importance of Digital
Literacy skills. The addition of Library/Media Specialist positions at three elementary schools mid-fall
2020 thanks to Chapter 70 funding has now provided all of our elementary students access to highly
trained and certified Library Media Specialists. This year has posed some unique challenges. Our libraries
are working on recovering books lent out to students in 2020, but some students may not return to
buildings this year. It will be important to fully fund the libraries’ book budget line to replenish lost
materials, without burdening families with this financial cost. Though our students have had access to
ebooks during remote learning, they need to regain access to printed personal literacy resources in our
libraries. The conditions of the current school year has necessitated the use of school libraries for
teacher work and meeting spaces and other administrative needs; however, in the 2021-2022 school
year, students will need access to their library spaces and materials again. 
For many students, the school library is their sole source of independent reading materials. In 2021-
2022, the FPS Libraries are greatly looking forward to helping kids return to a love of pleasure-reading. 
The print collections in the majority of the district’s libraries are out of date. The FPS Libraries must
invest in contemporary, representative, linguistically diverse, and curriculum-supporting print and digital
resources to update their collections. However, for the first time in two decades, all FPS K-12 schools will
be staffed by a licensed, Library Media Specialist. We are very excited about this level of staffing, but
there is work yet to be done. The Library Media Department has only recently been rebuilt from a group
that was primarily staffed by Unit T members to a professional team of licensed Unit A specialists. The
Department does not yet have a complete standardized Curriculum across the district’s schools, and
does not have adequate staffing to ensure the implementation of these standards with fidelity.

MEDIA AND COMMUNICATIONS
The start of FY20 was like any other year. There were normal challenges and solutions and the Media
and Communications Office was fortunate to have an FSU Intern to assist with the fun, public-facing
social media support to highlight the amazing things happening in our schools. This shifted in March of
2020 and the Media and Communications Office provided more communication than ever to families, 
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  59
Page 60
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
staff, and the wider Framingham community. The pandemic forced the creation of a new COVID-19
Website, live video broadcasts, increased translation of information and documents, constant updates
and district-to-home communication, a social media campaign soliciting photos of students learning in a
remote setting, a series of trilingual virtual events, the rollout of new tools for teachers, a week-long
celebration of our amazing teachers with several videos of student submitted photos and videos, and in
general an expansion to capacity that was nearly impossible. 
Fiscal Year 2020-2021 has continued to stretch the Media and Communications Manager in time and
capacity to new levels. The amount and frequency of nuanced communication to various family groups
has increased exponentially; the District fast-tracked the launch of a robust school-home
communication tool (Remind) in the fall and expanded all-staff access to the District’s newsletter tool
(Smore); the District shifted to 100% virtual means for special meetings and webinars - not just for
sharing information to the public, but for special orientations, school choice meetings for incoming
Kindergarteners, and school and grade-level presentations; an increase in video creation for how-to
tutorials or presentations to accompany some of the live meetings; supporting the renaming of
Woodrow Wilson Elementary School; providing several real-time and self-paced PD for all staff
members; hosting virtual press conferences; launching the Return to Learn Hub for back to school
information; fully supporting all department-owned operational messaging for the Kindergarten
registration and choice process (PIC), bus information and denials (Transportation), MyMedBot and
Pooled Testing Communication; and more. Almost all of the District events executed through a mix of
Zoom and Smore were facilitated by the Media and Communications Manager on the back-end. While
this expansion was happening, the fun and positive social media efforts slowed down - partially because
the visual content for things normally celebrated wasn’t possible, but also fun and positive things have
taken a backseat to the important communication happening on a daily or weekly basis; the website
template update has been paused; inclusion and leadership in the Massachusetts K-12 PR Learning
Network was halted; the opportunity to collaborate with city and community partners was not feasible; 
and there were several other things that just could not be accomplished. 
The Media and Communications Office is very much looking forward to seeing and showcasing teachers
and students in classes, on stages, and on fields. It is the hope of this office that the new tools will
continue to serve an expanded purpose and deepen school-parent connection and engagement. It is the
goal of this office to continue providing transparent, helpful, inspiring, timely, and relevant information
through communication channels such as the Framingham Public Schools website and social media
accounts, media relations, as well as, providing communications-related training opportunities for
Teachers, Administration, and Staff. If afforded, it would be incredible to receive additional personnel
support to help balance the all consuming day-to-day operation as well as the strategic growth as this
office continues to support all Departments and Schools in addition to pursuing its own initiatives.

CAMERON MIDDLE SCHOOL
The 2019-2020 school year ended abruptly in March of 2020. Prior to school closing our Instructional
Leadership team was meeting on a regular basis, reviewing data and providing feedback for our Tier 1
support plan. Our Tier 1 support plan sets benchmarks for us to meet every few months in the areas of
classroom visit rounds, discipline, iReady, and attendance. We regularly conducted classroom visit
rounds to our content area teachers and used collected data to inform our professional development. 
The Universal Design for Learning team provided professional development on a monthly basis to all
staff and staff were implementing Universal Design for Learning strategies in all classrooms. 
The faculty and the administration of Cameron Middle School continued with our focus on working on
the goals developed with the support of Assistant Superintendent Anne Ludes in our Tier 1 support plan
during the 2020-2021 school year. 
So far this year, we have increased our classroom visit rounds (CVR) so that we are visiting all content
teacher classrooms, World Language teacher classrooms, and Specialist classrooms each week. Our
Instructional Leadership Team analyzes the data from these visits to find themes where we can provide
professional development or teacher support for our staff. We have increased student time on the
iReady platform as well as increased iReady lesson pass rates for both ELA and Math. We have worked
closely with our Tier 2 team to develop interventions to support students remotely and will transition to
providing in school interventions. We have monitored student attendance each month and the support

staff is working closely with families and students to increase student engagement. As a school we
continue to focus on Universal Design for Learning practices, which focuses on creating access to
engaging and rigorous grade-level content for all students by eliminating barriers that may impede
access to the curriculum. Our teachers are receiving bi-weekly Universal Design for Learning professional
development and are implementing strategies learned in their instruction. Cameron staff are also
participating in Engaging Schools professional development provided by teacher leaders and
administrators and implementing strategies learned in their instruction. During three of our early
release days staff will receive professional development around Culturally Responsive teaching. This
professional development has aligned well with our after school anti racism group. 
For the 2021-2022 school year, we will not request additional staff. Our staff and administration will
continue to work on the goals in our Tier 1 support plan, with guidance from Assistant Superintendent
Anne Ludes. This includes our focus on Classroom Visit Rounds, chronic absenteeism, iReady and major
discipline referrals. Our Instructional Leadership Team will review data and develop action steps twice a
month. Additionally, we will work closely with the support staff to increase our social emotional
learning lesson plans to teach to students during our flex blocks. Our Tier 2 team will continue to meet
weekly to review student concerns and place students in appropriate Tier 2 interventions. Through our
continued Universal Design for Learning professional development we will continue to plan lessons
using the Universal Design for Learning lens. Our work with Engaging Schools will help us plan lessons
and use strategies to increase student engagement and student reflection.

FULLER MIDDLE SCHOOL
During the 2019-2020 school year the faculty and administration of Fuller Middle School began the first
year of implementation of their Sustainable Improvement Plan. It was a year that focused on creating
internal structures and protocols in order to promote higher levels of efficacy. Consistent and equitable
schedules for teachers were designed that focused on CTT (Collaborative Team Time), PLCs (Professional
Learning Communities), data analysis meetings, and co-planning time. A meeting agenda template and
universal meeting norms were established. These structures were created and then implemented at a
high level of fidelity across the school; these structures continue to help support our work and have
become an integral part of our school culture. During FY 2020 Fuller continued its professional
development with Universal Design for Learning (UDL), which focuses on creating access to engaging
and rigorous grade-level lessons for all students by eliminating barriers that may impede access to
grade-level standard-based curriculum. 
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  65
Page 66
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Teachers also participated in professional development with CCE (Center for Collaborative Education) to
develop data analysis skills to inform teaching and awareness of protocols that may be used to support
this work. A part-time ELD (English Language Development) coach worked with teachers to provide
support in best SEI (Sheltered English Immersion) teaching practices. A new ILT (Instructional Leadership
Team) and Intervention Team were created that consisted of highly-skilled educators representing
programs and teams across the school. Even with the abrupt closing of the physical school building in
March 2020, the ILT, CTTs, PLCs, and the Intervention Team continued to meet and make progress
because of the structures that had been established earlier in the year. 
During the 2020-2021 year, we have continued to focus on meeting and exceeding the goals we set in
our Sustainable Improvement Plan. We have maintained with fidelity the structures we created during
FY2020 regarding CTT (Collaborative Team Time), data analysis, meeting agendas and norms, and co-
planning. We have continued our professional development focused on Tier I academic and SEL (Social
and Emotional Learning) instruction through UDL (Universal Design for Learning) and PBIS (Positive
Behavioral Interventions and Supports), and through our partnership with Engaging Schools. Teachers
teams have continued working with a coach from CCE (Center for Collaborative Education) in order to
strengthen their skills in effective protocols and data analysis to inform instruction. We added a full-time
ELD (English Language Development) coach to our faculty this year in order to provide increased support
in best SEI (Sheltered English Immersion) teaching practices for all of the faculty; this year we have
focused on instructional practices that support robust academic discourse in the classroom. The
Intervention Team has developed a comprehensive intervention plan that outlines the MTSS (Multi-
Tiered Systems of Support) at Fuller. 
Our administration, along with our ILT (Instructional Leadership Team) and School Council, have focused
on student and family engagement. This is the second year that Fuller has surveyed its students on their
connection to the school community and engagement in education, and this year a survey was designed
to guage family engagement in the school community and to identify barriers to engagement; we will be
using the results of this family survey to inform our work during FY 2022. The faculty has also engaged
in professional development in anti-racism and culturally responsive teaching. This year we have also
worked with the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Community Development to create Affinity Groups for
our students; we believe that the creation of these groups will create safe spaces in our school for all of
our students and will improve school culture and student engagement. 
At Fuller, we see the 2021-2022 year as an opportunity to grow our work as we move into the new Fuller
school building. The new Fuller has been designed with our programming and educational philosophies
in mind. The configuration of the classrooms, breakout spaces, cohort commons, and ample
professional gathering spaces support our vision of collaborative learning for both students and faculty, 
which will help bolster student engagement and achievement. We will remain committed to our
Sustainable Improvement Plan by maintaining the structures that were created in FY 2020, which will
continue to support CTT (Collaborative Team Times), data analysis, meeting agendas and norms, and co-
planning. We will continue to strengthen our Tier 1 instruction through our continued professional

development in UDL (Universal Design for Learning) and with Engaging Schools. Our ELD (English
Language Development) coach will continue supporting teachers around SEI strategies for our English
Language Learners in all classrooms. 
Our Literacy Specialist will be able to offer Tier 2 interventions to our students who demonstrate a need
for additional support outside of Tier 1 instruction. Our students will have access to Affinity Groups and
a robust afterschool program focused on academic achievement and social and emotional well-being. 
We will be using the results of our parent survey from FY 2021 to inform the way we create
opportunities for families to become active partners in our school community. The faculty will continue
their commitment to anti-racism and culturally responsive teaching through continued professional
development and PLCs (Professional Learning Communities). We will continue to monitor our progress
through state and district supported Progress Monitoring Meetings held every thirty days. We will
continue to strive to exceed our goals, so we are able to provide our students an engaging and rigorous
education while supporting their academic and social and emotional needs.

This year, 2020-2021, we were able to hire an additional School Social Worker. This has allowed us to
monitor additional students, reach out to families, and provide given time for the two Social Workers to
attend more team meetings. The 2020-2021 budget stays relatively the same. We were able to hire one
additional full-time Reading teacher. It was determined we were not in compliance to start the school
year with the incoming 6th graders reading needs, so the school district has contracted with an outside
agency to maintain compliance. We have also been able to hire five Classroom supervisors and three
Campus Aides to assist with coverages, cafe duties, etc. It is my recommendation that we keep those in
next year’s budget. We reduced our budget for the upcoming school year significantly by eliminating
monies for contract services, paper, and supplies.

The 2020-2021 school year has been very productive for Barbieri School. With the strong support of the
Department of Health and Wellness, all but one of our classroom teachers are now trained in
Responsive Classroom, along with our administrative team and some support, ESL and special education
staff. We have integrated this approach with our long-standing PBIS program (CARE) to strengthen the
ways we are creating strong classroom communities and teaching and reinforcing common expectations
throughout our school. Our new SEB coach has also been key in helping us implement a number of new
Tier 2 interventions and providing coaching for teaching and paraprofessional staff. Together, these
efforts have had a positive effect on behavior and school climate. We have also made substantial
progress on completing the action steps outlined in our School Improvement Plan. We were pleased to
see these efforts bear fruit as all but one of our sub-groups met or exceeded their MCAS targets. We
expect to see continued progress on this year's results due to our focus on improving targeted small
group instruction. The Leadership Team has also begun a close study of the Guiding Principles for Dual
Language Education, which will guide our work for the coming year. 
For the next school year, 2021-2022, we expect our work to continue strengthening our small group
instruction including increasing the ESL services provided to our growing number of newcomers at the
upper grade levels. We also plan to continue strengthening our implementation of Responsive
Classroom, along with the new SEL programming (Zones of Regulation and Second Step) begun this year.

The 2019-2020 year was challenging for everyone due to the pandemic. Facing many obstacles, the
teachers, staff, students, and families in the Brophy and FPS community were forced to pivot and shift
how we taught, how we learned, and how we worked together to help students meet their potential. In
many respects, we exceeded expectations as we would have never imagined being able to teach and
learn fully remotely. 
Our school and district did an amazing job getting chromebooks and hotspots out to our families in an
effort to have our students experience equitable learning experiences. Now in 2021, we continue to
maintain those systems and to again make modifications as we are now welcoming back students. The

City and the District have been amazing in helping support our students and staff by buying furniture to
allow for social distancing, providing PPE and signage, and writing and rewriting plans to make sure all
efforts for mitigation are being utilized to keep everyone safe. 
We are grateful that we have been supported with our efforts to support our families social and
emotional needs throughout the pandemic with food, support, clothing, school materials, and access to
SEMH resources in the community. Moving forward to 2022, we are keenly aware that as children
transition back to school, we will continue to need to provide these supports so they may access the
curricula. The District has continued their commitments to support the growth of our Dual Language
program and we will grow our ASD program as well. We are excited for a remodeled “Specials'' suite
that will ease some of the space burdens in our school and give the Art and Music programs the space
they deserve.

DUNNING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
The 2020-2021 year was a very different school year due to COVID-19, however the Dunning community
worked tirelessly to make it the best it could possibly be. As a school, we shifted to the remote model, 
providing teachers with professional development as permitted to facilitate the extremely quick pivot. 
Teachers set up Google classrooms and connected to Securly to oversee all students, as well as utilizing
Smore to facilitate two way communication with families. Staff maintained strong relationships with
students and their families, which was evidenced by high attendance rates across the school. 
During the current FY2021, our English Language Development staff, along with our Instructional
Leadership Team, has focused on providing a school wide set of practices for both instruction and
educator collaboration that would ensure the success of all of our students. We are looking forward to
hiring a new English Language Development teacher to support the increasing number of ELs who
attend Dunning. We are in the process of welcoming our new Social Emotional Behavioral Coach. We
have continued to build upon last year’s focus of providing social emotional learning intervention across
the school. Our Tier II team has developed a process for identifying and monitoring students in need of
Tier II interventions. We have also begun creating a data collection tool for gathering data before, during
and after an intervention. This data has been helpful in matching students to interventions, planning
targeted behavior goals, and determining if students should continue with an intervention. We are
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  69

FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
excited to have the opportunity to hire a Library Media Specialist and have updated our library with new
shelving and tables. We are also excited to add an additional 19.5 hour Interventionist to support the
needs of our students. Lastly, we are very happy to welcome the Explorers Program to Dunning this
year. In the short amount of time that they have physically been at Dunning, they have become a
valuable addition to the Dunning Community, effectively partnering with the school day staff. 
As we think about FY2022, we are looking forward to the new staffing in our building referenced above
to support our social emotional curriculum, growing EL population and support of the Library/Media
curriculum. We hope to continue to grow our STEAM initiative. As students are back in the building with
less restrictions, we want to bring back technology buddies between grade levels, with some of our
upper grade students teaching our staff members about coding and use of our programmable robots. 
Another important focus will be ensuring culturally responsive practices throughout the school. As part
of that focus, we will be providing professional development for staff as well as looking for opportunities
to provide parent education around Social Justice and Anti-Racism topics. Lastly, we hope to continue to
build the capacity of staff, parents/guardians and students around technology knowledge and skills
through professional development, workshops and teacher-parent partnerships.

HEMENWAY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Hemenway Elementary School strives to provide the highest quality education possible so that each
student develops the necessary skills and habits of mind to become a critical thinker, to be respectful, 
knowledgeable, and a creative citizen, prepared for the middle school experience and life in the twenty-
first century. Currently we serve 520 students in kindergarten through grade 5. We have 101 English
language learners of which 17 are SEI beginners. We have 30 students in our substantially separate
special education classrooms and 62 students requiring high levels of Inclusion support through special
education. Hemenway School is committed to providing all students with high quality rigorous, and
engaging standards based instruction across the curriculum. Hemenway staff engage in collaborative
practices and has developed a shared responsibility for student learning across grade levels and
specialties. 
We are committed to the belief that all students can learn with high levels of achievement and growth. 
Our commitment to a growth mindset extends not only to our students but to our staff, as adult
learners. As a staff, we continue to focus on developing a culture of thinking in our classrooms that
includes teaching moves, routines, and strategies that promote “making student thinking visible.” By
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  70

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
creating this culture of thinking, we are working to ensure that all students are engaged in meaningful
learning across the curriculum. 
Emphasis on social-emotional learning: Our goal is to foster socially responsible decision making in
our students. In addition to high academic standards, we have high standards for student behavior. 
Hemenway School’s PBIS team, in collaboration with staff and administration, has developed the
HemenWAY Positive Behavior Matrix and implemented the Hemenway PAWsitive Behavioral
Intervention Program. The PAWSitive Behavior Program is based upon a systemic approach to proactive, 
explicitly taught and practiced behavioral expectations for school-wide behavior and the Response to
Intervention model. Furthermore, all classrooms, kindergarten through grade 5 have instituted
components of Responsive Classroom, and are implementing the Second Step social competency
program as well as Zones of Regulation, which fosters self-regulation and emotional control. Supporting
students in developing their social and emotional skills is critical to their success in school and in life! 
Over the past several years, Hemenway has been a host site for The Teaching and Learning Alliance. 
Administrators and teachers from public school systems across the United States have come to
Hemenway School to take part in TLA’s Guided Observation Program, Taking a Closer Look at Exemplary
Literacy in K-5 Classrooms. 
Hemenway School’s school improvement plan goals include: 
Goal 1: Adopt and implement culturally responsive practices in order to ensure the learning and growth
of all with students including students of diverse socioeconomic, racial, ethnic, cultural, gender and
language backgrounds. 
Goal 2: Commit to academic excellence through the consistent implementation of universally-designed
instructional practices that provide rigorous and engaging learning experiences for all students with
multiple entry points while narrowing the achievement gaps of English Language Learners/Emerging
Bilinguals and students with special needs. As a result of the commitment to these instructional
practices, all students, no matter their entry point, will grow at least one year, every year. 
Goal 3: Cultivate an inclusive school culture that addresses the social emotional wellness by
strengthening relationships and incorporating [URL: "https://traumasensitiveschools.org/frequently-asked-questions/"] trauma-sensitive, evidence-based structures and supports
that allow for all students, staff and families to feel engaged, safe, and valued. 
Goal 4: Strengthen school, family, and organizational partnerships and engagement for all members of
the school community. Create an inclusive environment and provide families with consistent and equal
access to communications, activities, and decision-making opportunities.

KING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
The 2020-2021 school year has proven to be an exceptionally challenging one for all schools in the
country, including King Elementary School. Despite the challenges caused by the pandemic, we are
extremely proud of the extraordinary work our teachers and staff have done to meet the needs of our
students by not only providing them with exceptional instruction but critical social emotional support as
well. As we welcomed 370 students back to their virtual classrooms this fall, after an unprecedented
2020 spring term, our educators were prepared with essential tools and technology to deliver the
highest quality education possible. Last spring, we knew we had educator positions to fill for the coming
school year and were thrilled with the teachers selected to join our special school community. In August
of 2020, we welcomed five new classroom teachers in grades 1, 2, and 4 whose first days as members of
the King School community were in the virtual classroom and only recently entered the brick and mortar
building for the first time. 
This school year we have expanded our special education program by adding a second classroom to
meet the needs of students on the Autism Spectrum who require specialized instruction. Those
classrooms are staffed with highly trained educators and support personnel. With the addition of a new
grade level each year we are now in our second year as a K-5 elementary school. With the growing
number of students, the King Elementary School community has changed. To meet the demands of a
changing population, this year the King School has shifted from having an identified School Counselor to
a two-person Social Worker model. By creating the strongest connection possible between the school, 
home, and community, the Social Worker team is able to foster therapeutic relationships with students
and families appropriate for a school setting. They work directly with parents and families by assisting
them in accessing school and community services and resources, including providing and facilitating
Family Workshops. 
Along with administration, the team collaborates with and provides training and/or assistance to
teachers to address concerns around student performance and behavior management as well as provide
students with needed supports. As in previous years, FY21 continues to see King School and its staff fully
invested in the social emotional well-being of our students. In our belief that SEL is paramount in a
child’s overall education, teachers have not only provided our students with explicit SEL instruction
using research-based curriculum provided by FPS, such as Second Step, Zones of Regulation, and PBIS, 
but they continue to integrate SEL into all academic and content areas. This year we have seen an
increase in teachers taking on leadership roles, participating on committees both at King and within the
district such as ILT, School Council, PBIS, and the Code of Conduct and Technology committees. 
Additionally, several staff members currently serve in leadership roles within King’s newly established
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  72
Page 73
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Anti-Racism Social Justice Committee with the goal of making King a more inclusive and socially just
environment for all of our staff and students. In support of our STEAM program, King has continued its
partnership with the Museum of Science (MoS). While some of our plans have been put on hold due to
COVID-19 restrictions,we have been meeting with MoS staff to plan for upcoming focused teacher
sabbaticals to learn about and create ways to increase opportunities for students to engage in the
science and engineering practices within integrated curriculum lessons. Meanwhile, the District’s STEAM
Coach, whose home base is in King’s STEAM Resource Center, has been working on aligning science
curriculum content to the standards at the elementary level. She has been using King as a field site to
implement initial lessons in order to iterate and adjust content before sharing with the district. An
example of this in action was the Grade 4 “How Do We See” Coding Integration activity, ‘Build a Light
Museum”.
Looking ahead to FY2022, King Elementary School plans to continue to strengthen our systems for
identifying students in need of Tier 2 supports and effectively providing appropriate interventions to
support student social emotional, academic and behavioral competencies. Additionally, we will continue
to strengthen the integration of STEAM into curriculum lessons as well as organize the existing STEAM
Resource Center so that teachers are better able to access materials and technology in order to bring
the makerspace into their own classrooms any time on any day, without limitations. We look forward to
securing a new .5 ELD coach to support our increasing ELL population as well as the teachers who
service them each day. Additionally, King will collaborate with the Office of Bilingual Education to
develop systems and protocols as well as identify and acquire appropriate resources to more effectively
welcome and serve our multilingual students and families. This would include training additional staff to
conduct Home Visits. Furthermore, we plan to add to our current support staff team with a Social
Emotional Behavioral Coach so that we are better able to provide support to meet the increasing social-
emotional and behavioral needs of our student body. 
Finally, we look forward to making some changes in the educational structure of our 5th grade team. We
will be moving to a Departmentalization model, sometimes called Platooning, or subject specialization
for our 5th grade classes only. Some key research-based reasons to make this shift include; 
● Students will benefit from different teaching styles. 
● Teachers will have more time to plan, set up, and implement creative, hands-on activities. 
● Allows teachers to more quickly identify student needs and develop appropriate interventions
to meet those needs. 
● Departmentalization will help to better prepare students for middle school. 
We at the King School are most appreciative of all that the School Committee does to support each
school, each staff member, and most importantly, each student in Framingham. We look forward to that
continued support in FY2022.

MCCARTHY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
The 2020-2021 school year has been one like we have never experienced before. Yet, despite the
multiple, seemingly unending challenges of teaching and learning during a pandemic- teaching remotely, 
teaching synchronously, teaching asynchronously, teaching concurrently, working to build relationships
through a computer, to name a few- we at McCarthy school have been successful at engaging students, 
tracking attendance, supporting families, and educating our students. At the start of our last school year
we came together as a community to build a playground. This year, similarly, we came together as a
community, not to build a playground, but to build a new type of community - a community where
professionals, working together, supporting one another, drawing on resources and prior professional
development, who despite the pandemic, collectively remain committed to providing all students with
access to high quality instruction to ensure all students demonstrate at least a year’s growth. 
As we continuously improve the ways we provide high quality learning opportunities for our students, 
we have been intentional and focused on connecting all of our work to the goals and benchmarks of our
Turnaround Plan. Teaming structures across the school include agendas, norms, protocols, and various
forms of data. We use data to inform instruction and practice at the whole school level (Instructional
Leadership Team ILT), at the grade level (Grade Teams/Coaches/Admin) and at the student level
(Teacher.) The classroom visit rounds tool (CVR) is a reference of research based best practices, used in
planning, for data collection, and feedback. Our Instructional Leadership Team is using Data Inquiry
Cycles to identify schoolwide patterns and trends and inform practice. Our staffing decisions, increasing
our ESL teacher by 1.0 FTE and increasing our .5 English Language Development Coach to a full-time, 
has provided smaller instructional groupings for our language learners and coaching cycles for our
teachers. The addition of our Social Emotional Behavior Coach has allowed us to solidify a tiered system
of support, including a menu of Tier II interventions, centered around the Learning and Life
Competencies, that are progress monitored weekly and collected in a school wide intervention
spreadsheet. The team uses SWIS data to determine classroom support and small skill groups. 
Next year, 2021-2022, it is our hope and expectation that the systems and structures that will be in
place by the end of this school year, will yield strong evidence and data that is reflective of highly
effective and functioning teams - across the school, at the grade levels, and in our classroom, as shown
in our student data. A climate of collective ownership for improving student achievement will not only
be the expectation, but the norm.

POTTER ROAD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
The fiscal year 2020 was an exciting year for Potter Road. From infrastructure improvements to the
hiring of new staff, we saw a lot of exciting changes. An asbestos abatement/tiling project was
completed over the summer of 2019 and our new floors look beautiful. We spent the first year with our
incredibly talented new mathematics instructional coach. She has proven to be a leader in both our
school and across Framingham Public Schools. On another note, we worked incredibly hard on the
expansion of our dual language program--now in grade 3. While it’s hard to believe, just over half of our
students are bilingual, bi-literate and bicultural. The Metrowest Daily News published a story in both
English and Portuguese on our successes. 
Despite the COVID-19 closure, Potter Road has a lot to be proud of in FY2021. Thanks to Chapter 70
money we hired an excellent library media specialist who is helping students learn about digital literacy
and critical thinking skills. Our dual-language program has grown by a grade and for the third-grade
addition, we welcomed two new staff members. We also welcomed a new ESL (English as a Second
Language) teacher. In addition, as we work to support our students’ social and emotional needs, we
hope to hire a social-emotional behavioral coach by the end of the year. We appreciate all of the hard
work of the School Committee and are looking forward to your continued support in the fiscal year
2022. 
Next fiscal year, FY 2022 we’re looking forward to being able to support the professional development
of staff by offering up opportunities for learning from the renowned Teacher’s College in New York City
(albeit virtually). In addition, we hope to offer our new dual-language teachers professional
development from Research for Better Teaching, (The Skillful Teacher course). Finally, in this post-COVID
world, we’d like to support all educators by increasing their knowledge base on culturally responsive
teaching practices to engage all students. We hope to be able to bring in presenters to discuss these
topics.

STAPLETON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Fiscal year 2021 was an exciting year for Stapleton Elementary School. We embraced teaching and
learning in a pandemic and prioritized engagement and access for all students in everything we did. Staff
organized a variety of special interest groups focused on culturally responsive teaching, community
mentorships, SEI Beginner practices and social-emotional wellness. Family workshops were arranged on
topics of interest and importance, including navigating remote learning during a pandemic and return to
learn updates. 
FY2021 was the first year for students and staff to live the restructuring of support and structures for
students in our Therapeutic Learning Center (right-side, currently 29 students enrolled) and all other
students (left-side, currently 282 students). In addition to COVID-specific staffing that joined our team
(classroom supervisor and campus aide), we added two positions: 
● 1.0 Library Media Specialist: funded in the operational budget to assure equitable instruction in
all elementary schools
● 1.0 Technology Integration Coach: funded through Title 1 in an effort to support the infusion of
remote learning practices into concurrent teaching. 
Stapleton now has approximately 73 students utilizing ESL support and receiving Sheltered English
Immersion instruction in the classroom. Our students continue to benefit from the support of two
language assistant teachers who joined our English as a Second Language (ESL) team in FY2020. Our ESL
team consists of two ESL teachers 1.0 and and a .2 ELD Coach. We recognize the need for additional
coaching support in order to strengthen our SEI instructional practices. In addition, the remote and
hybrid learning models utilized in the pandemic have also identified a need for additional outreach
support for families. 
It is essential that the FY2022 budget supports the staffing model created in FY2020 to support the
behavioral health and safety needs of students and staff, including a Social Emotional Behavioral Coach
and Student Support Specialist. In addition to the district-wide efforts to prioritize social-emotional
learning (SEL) by providing an SEL curriculum and schedule that allows for SEL instruction in all
classrooms daily, Stapleton staff are working in collaboration with district leaders to strengthen the
structures and supports for all students. Short and long term action steps are outlined in [URL: "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j73xhqW6OTsd5nLua9J0ul1yunqt-h2yHDe_vaAsrlg/edit?usp=sharing"] the 2020-21

As outlined in the SIP, FY2022 will be a year for the Stapleton to continue to strengthen the social-
emotional and academic support available for all students and meet our goals for the new design of
Stapleton’s Therapeutic Learning Center (TLC) for students requiring this level of support. This will
require continued support from District staff allocated to Stapleton this spring to coach and monitor
progress. Stapleton also wants to assure our growing EL population has the support and instruction

required to acquire English Language Proficiency, which includes student-centered coaching from an ELD
Coach. Currently, we have a 0.2 coach, and we hope to expand this support by 0.3 next year to allow for
a .5 ELD coach. We appreciate that all FY2021 positions will continue to be funded in FY2022. Also, we
look forward to another year of instructional supplies and funding expenses for our teachers and their
classrooms. We appreciate all of the hard work of the School Committee and are looking forward to
your continued support in fiscal year 2022.

WILSON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Woodrow Wilson Elementary School- An IB World School has achieved many accomplishments in FY20-
21, particularly with data-driven instruction, Social Emotional Learning, Dual Language Education, and IB
professional development and implementation. Standards-based lesson planning, data-driven
instruction, and targeted interventions in math and reading have improved instructional practices and
increased assessment results. The Instructional Leadership Team (ILT) and leadership team have
developed a cycle of feedback on reflecting on data, implementing action steps and having shared
ownership of all our students. In particular, we are closely monitoring sub-groups of students and how
to address their academic and social emotional needs. 
The Dual Language (50% English, 50% Portuguese) strand in Kindergarten, First, and Second Grades
continue to make great strides this year and will expand to Third Grade in the 2021-2022 school year to
include 40% of our students. The leadership team at Wilson is dedicated to working with our Dual
Language Teachers to support and improve this program. Our IB site visit review team shared the
feedback “You have something special with your language program,” stating, “It is apparent that the
school community understands that all students are language learners and all teachers are language
teachers.” Social Emotional Learning aligning the IB pedagogy with FPS curriculum resources created a
shared understanding of social skills and provided individualized support for the whole child. With the
use of the Universal Designs for Learning (UDL) Framework, multiple means of representation, action, 
expression, and engagement have been a focus of teaching and learning. Our 5th grade Student Council
Ambassadors continue to serve as role models representing our school. Another area of improvement
was the increase in local and global connections to enrich curriculum through meaningful learning
experiences through field trips (virtual, in building or community-based). We continue to work alongside
our local police department to build relationships through the Officer Read Aloud program.

Looking ahead to the 2021-2022 year, Woodrow Wilson School hopes to maintain the momentum of the
accomplishments from the FY21 year and to continue to build a positive school climate for students and
staff. To continue to support our diverse learners’ literacy development, Woodrow Wilson will need
more Portuguese literacy materials for our book room, classrooms, and families. With the growth of our
Dual Language classrooms, additional curriculum and materials in both Portuguese and English are
essential for this unique program that is part of our district. In addition, with the continued needs of our
English Language Learners in our school, native language program assistants are essential for these
students’ needs. Based on the recommendations from the IB Program Evaluation as well as Wilson’s
Collective Turnaround Plan, Woodrow Wilson School will implement a revised Sustainable Improvement

BLOCKS PRESCHOOL
Once the repairs were completed for the library due to structural issues, we were able to move our staff
back to this area for office and therapy use beginning January 2020. Our support staff, therapists and
speech-language pathologists once again had offices where they had a more conducive environment to
carry out evaluations, consult with families and professionals, and provide services to students. Our
stage was once again available to be used for our family nights, presentations, and creative arts
performance now that we were able to move back the furniture/materials back to the library. Children
and staff enjoyed returning to a more appropriate learning and teaching environment. 
During the 19-20 year BLOCKS Preschool received a $6,900 grant through the Early Childhood
Special Education Discretionary Federal Program Grant (298). The grant funding focused on
social/emotional learning and included the following: 
● Children’s literature focused on social skills, coping skills, feelings, and self-regulation; 
● Curriculums/Resources focused on social/emotional learning; and 
● Activity areas for less structured play times to enhance social integration. 
Materials and equipment were purchased through the grant directly tied to these grant priorities
including: 
● 3 additional Second Step Kits for the preschool level that provide a social emotional curriculum
that the district is using at the elementary level

● Children’s literature and teacher resources focused on Social Emotional Learning aligned to the
topics in our Second Step Curriculum
● Augmentative communication devices to enhance social integration and provide peer modeling
Given the immediate change to remote teaching and learning in March 2020 due to COVID 19, the
preschool staff worked collaboratively on providing home learning opportunities as well as google
meets with children and families. Activities were provided in three languages facilitating
communication with families who were now fully supporting their child’s learning at home. 
During the FY21 school year and given the pandemic, our immediate goal was to improve on and expand
our technology skills when working with the very young child and in particular, our special education
students. Working in concert with the technology department, our students received brand new touch
screen chromebooks to facilitate and support learning at home when our students were learning
virtually. In addition, PD was provided for staff and has continued with various platforms/tools (Google
classroom, Kami, Remind, SMORE, Pear Deck) being introduced and supported through the Office of
Technology and the Office for Teaching and Learning. Technology also had our whole building rewired
for internet access points in every instructional space at Juniper Hill during the December break 2020. 
The preschool children are resilient and are incredibly flexible in being able to pivot from virtual to in
person learning and vice versa. Teachers have developed amazing teaching and learning activities for
children remotely however, we recognize that for the great majority of our students, in person
instruction is the best mode of learning for the preschool child. Our young children have learned all the
health and safety protocols and are doing incredibly well following these at school while truly enjoying
their school experience albeit different from the past. 
During this past year, many COVID-19 supports were instituted and purchased by the district such as air
filters, screens on windows, individual bins for children’s coats/belongings, individual materials for each
child, additional walkie talkies, signage/PPE/hygiene products, hiring of campus aide as well as
technology supports (new chromebooks for students and paraprofessional staff, headphones, 
projectors, speakers). A committee of preschool staff worked voluntarily during the summer of 2020 to
develop protocols and procedures for every area and aspect of our school day and how it applied to
staff, children and families. As the first school in our district that brought all students back who wished
to return to in person learning, we learned what worked best, what needed to change and ways to
improve. 
Once again, we submitted a $6,900 grant through the Early Childhood Special Education Discretionary
Federal Program Grant (298). This year’s grant funding focused on technology and supporting
equipment to improve the learning experience for children learning in person, remotely, or hybrid which
included the following: 
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  79
Page 80
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
● Technology - ordering of additional chromebooks allowing therapists to see children responding
to instruction while presenting lessons and to replace outdated iPad that no longer are
compatible with newer apps
● Projector screens allowing in person peers to be more connected to remote learners
● Webcams and speakers to improve audio and visual learning experiences
● Additional augmentative communication devices for families to use and keep at home. 
Our goals and hopes for the future is to continue to support and expand preschool programs in
order to allow all our students to have a preschool experience before entering kindergarten. To this
end, we are working to expand universal pre-K experiences with community partners under the
Office of Community Resource Development. In order to achieve this goal of Universal Pre-K, space
within schools will also need to be made available for us to achieve this goal for all. 
For the 21-22 school year, we look forward to welcoming every preschool student back as an in person
learner. Topics that we feel are important and need to be addressed are: 
● Providing quality preschool for students before entering kindergarten to close the present gap
that exists where 26% of students entering K have no preschool experience. 
● Space for increasing preschool enrollment (for both special education and general education
students) 
● Continuing education and training on social emotional learning as this is the foundation of all we
do at the early childhood level
● Expand Music instruction at the preschool level allowing students to receive music on a weekly
basis (presently children receive music instruction 20 minutes every other week) 
● Continue to expand universal Pre-K opportunities in concert with community partners and
eventually create Early Childhood Centers within FPS schools
During the 2019-2020 school year BLOCKS Preschool worked collaboratively to accomplish the
following: 
1. The completion of repairs in the library area was a significant accomplishment and was done in
concert with the support of other FPS departments and the City of Framingham. Our support staff, 
therapists and speech-language pathologists once again have offices where they have a more
conducive environment to carry out evaluations, consult with families and professionals, and
provide services to students. Our stage is once again available to be used for our family nights, 
presentations, and creative arts performance now that we were able to move back the
furniture/materials back to the library. Children and staff have already noticed the change and are
enjoying returning to a more appropriate learning and teaching environment. 
2. This year BLOCKS Preschool received a $10,000 grant through the Early Childhood Special
Education Discretionary Federal Program Grant (298). The grant funding is focused on
social/emotional learning and includes the following: 
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  80

● Children’s literature focused on social skills, coping skills, feelings, and self-regulation; 
● Curriculums/Resources focused on social/emotional learning; and 
● Activity areas for less structured play times to enhance social integration.

PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
Local Contribution: The required Local Contribution (sometimes referred to as Target Share) is the
minimum amount each school district is expected to pay toward its Foundation Budget. It is designed to
represent each community’s “ability to pay” or how much local tax revenue a city or town can
reasonably raise and dedicate to the operation of its schools. The amount is set by formula and based on
a town’s property values and aggregate resident income. Across the state there is a wide variation in
each community’s required Local Contribution. The following reflects the last twelve years of
Framingham’s actual Local Contribution to the School Department’s Operating budget and the FY22
projected contribution of $91,198,630: 
Chapter 70 State Aid: The Chapter 70 program is the major program of state aid to public elementary
and secondary schools. In addition to providing state aid to support school operations, it also establishes

minimum spending requirements for each school district and minimum requirements for each
municipality's share of school costs. 
Framingham’s FY22 Chapter 70 State Aid per the Governor’s budget proposal provides the City with
$57,034,315, a $279,090 increase to the City’s FY21 Chapter 70 Aid of $56,755,225. The following
reflects the last twelve years of actual Chapter 70 funding Framingham has received and the FY22
projected Chapter 70 amount of $57,034,315:

PER PUPIL SPENDING
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  87
Page 88
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) employs a
comprehensive methodology of calculating per pupil expenditures that is designed to allow comparative
analysis among districts. By using reporting methods that are consistent across all public school districts
statewide, the DESE’s data allows Framingham to compare its per pupil spending to surrounding
communities. Per pupil expenditures are calculated by dividing a district's operating costs by its average
pupil membership (FTEs), including in-district expenditures per pupil and total expenditures per pupil, 
which includes in-district and out-of-district spending and enrollment. 
Historical per pupil spending is in graph form below. These calculations show all school operating
expenditures including those outside the general fund such as grants, private donations, and revolving
accounts. Expenditures are shown in categories reported by the school district within the annual DESE
End-of-Year Financial Report. 
The data submitted by districts to the State is subject to an annual independent audit, assuring that
each school district accurately portrays revenues and expenditures and consistently reports expenses in
appropriate functional categories. All expenditure groups include the following: 
● school committee appropriations
● municipal appropriations outside the school committee budget that affect schools
● federal grants
● state grants
● circuit breaker funds
● private grants and gifts
● school choice and other tuition revolving funds
● athletic funds
● school lunch funds
● other local receipts such as rentals and insurance receipts
The following graphs show Framingham’s In-District Expenditures per Pupil in FY19 and Framingham’s
Total District Expenditures per Pupil in FY19 compared to State per Pupil expenditures: 
Framingham’s In-District Expenditures per Pupil in FY19 (last FY audited) was $18,389 and the total
State Expenditure per pupil was $16,588. Framingham and State In-District expenditure per pupil
history is as follows:

CIRCUIT BREAKER 
As defined and explained in prior sections, Circuit Breaker is the State’s Special Education tuition
reimbursement program and with the implementation of the first year of the Student Opportunity Act, 
transportation reimbursement is now part of the program starting in FY22. The Circuit breaker
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  98
Page 99
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
reimbursement program provides state assistance to districts with high cost special needs students. The
FY22 budget includes $6,521,672 of Circuit Breaker funding that directly offsets out-of-district special
education tuition costs. The FY22 budget also includes $3,000,000 of FY21 Circuit Breaker carryover* 
funds to also directly offset out-of-district special education tuition costs. Further, the FY22 budget
includes $512,000 of FY22 Circuit Breaker transportation reimbursement that will pay for out-of-district
transportation costs. 
The following reflects the last twelve years of Framingham’s actual Circuit Breaker reimbursement
funding and the FY22 projected reimbursement: 
*Per the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, regulations allow communities and school districts
to carry forward up to one year's worth of state reimbursement, Division of Local Services advises communities
build balances in their SPED circuit breaker accounts in years when actual costs compare favorably with the budget
so that in years when SPED costs increase unexpectedly or the circuit breaker reimbursement drops, there will be
some circuit breaker revenue to cover any unforeseen costs. Building a circuit breaker balance is a good
management practice as it eliminates some of the risk associated with these unpredictable SPED costs.

1. Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) Feasibility Study for a Future Early Childhood
Center and Elementary School - $600,000
● A Pre-Feasibility Study for the renovation/replacement of an Elementary School was
conducted by TBA Architects the summer and fall of 2019. This study included review of
the Hemenway Elementary School site as well as property south of Route 9. Currently, 
the District has a limited number of schools south of Route 9. The District’s Long-Range
Facility Plan calls for a periodic renovation/replacement of three elementary schools
over the next 10-15 years. Developing a school south of Route 9 would serve the entire
city well by improving school accessibility, addressing PreK access gaps, and reducing
transportation costs by reducing the number of students who require busing across the
district in the current school choice model. In multiple votes during the fall/winter of
2020 the School Committee voted to make the pursuit of this new school south of Route
9 a top priority. This included voting to enter into the MSBA Statement of Interest
process, as well as seeking this funding through the capital budget allocations to
prepare for the MSBA’s eventual invitation into their Capital Pipeline. Over the years the
town, now the city, has also scheduled for their share of the new school as part of the
long-term capital plan. In order to participate in the MSBA reimbursement program, the
City must first appropriate $600,000 for a Full Feasibility Study. This study is required to
comply with MSBA guidelines in order for the City to receive an estimated
reimbursement rate of approximately 57% for a school construction project. 
2. Exterior Envelope Improvements to roofs, walls, windows, and doorways at Walsh Middle
School - $1,100,000 (reduced from initial request of $2,156,095) 
● The district’s five year capital plan includes estimates for the exterior envelopes of all
buildings. Each year the top project(s) are identified as priorities where urgent work is
needed to repair or replace exterior walls, windows and sealant systems and associated
components. FY21 projects were previously funded and are now in the construction
process at Hemenway and Wilson Elementary Schools, Cameron and Walsh Middle
Schools, BLOCKS Preschool at Juniper Hill, and the Transportation Building. This new
request is for the exterior walls, windows and sealant systems and associated
components to be removed and replaced or repaired at Walsh Middle School. 
3. Joint Athletic Field Project with the Division of Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs at the New
Fuller Middle School - $1,606,335 from FPS, remaining half from Parks
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  100
Page 101
FRAMINGHAM 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
● The Framingham Public School Department and the City Division of Parks, Recreation &
Cultural Affairs, in coordination with the Fuller School Building Committee, are
submitting a joint budget capital request for $3,212,670 to fund two artificial turf
playing fields at the new Fuller school site. Currently, the City only has one turf field, 
located at Framingham High School, within its inventory of athletic facilities. This is
below many other communities within the Baystate Conference. From a competitive
standpoint, this has left the over 3,000 athletes participating in sports at Framingham
High School, and all youth outdoor sports organizations, at a competitive disadvantage. 
Once this project is completed, it will provide the City with two fields that can provide
use to a wide range of sports, including soccer; lacrosse; football; and field hockey. In
addition, the field can be used for early season baseball and softball practices to allow
those spring teams an opportunity to have equitable access to playing fields that
athletes in other communities enjoy. An added benefit is that the students at the newly
constructed Fuller Middle School will also have access to an outdoor recreational
amenity for physical education classes and recesses for almost the entire calendar year. 
The School Department and Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division believes that
this project will be a huge benefit for the City and a source of pride for all students
involved in outdoor, active recreation. This project was also approved 3-0 by the City’s
Parks and Recreation Commission on September 30, 2020. 
4. Roof Repairs at the Farley Building - $1,826,975
● The Farley Middle School roof is in poor condition and moisture was observed at
multiple roof test cuts. Additional roof deck repairs are necessary based on moisture on
the deck, and areas of deterioration and rusting. The School Committee has prioritized it
due to the large backlog of roof projects across the District. The Farley roof project has
already been deferred. Continued deferral creates a public safety, financial, and
operational challenge for the city and creates a domino effect of backlog and rising costs
for other roof projects outlined on the spreadsheet. 
COVID-19 
The District has been very fortunate to receive funding through several federal, state, and local agencies since the
COVID-19 pandemic began back on March 13, 2020 including the City Cares Act funding source. The COVID-19
funding does not have an effect on any operating budget. The funding is completely separate and is to be used to
cover COVID-19 related costs. 
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS 2021 -2022 BUDGET  101
