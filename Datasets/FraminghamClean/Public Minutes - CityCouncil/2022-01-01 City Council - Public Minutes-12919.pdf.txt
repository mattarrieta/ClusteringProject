CALL TO ORDER 
1:20PM Mr. King called the meeting to order and welcomed everyone to the first meeting of
the City Council of the year. The Council briefly meets after the inauguration of the Mayor and
the City Council Members on alternate years. 
WELCOME AND INTRODUCTION OF CITY COUNCILORS
Mr. King welcomed Leora Mallach, District 7 and Noval Alexander, District 5 to the Council. 
As required by the Charter, the Council meets on New Years Day after the inauguration to
reorganize the Council and its subcommittees. Per the Charter, if the City Clerk is occupied wi th
other inaugural duties, the most senior member of the Council is to run the meeting and in the
event of a tie, the elder Council member is asked to run the meeting. Mr. King met the criteria, 
therefore ran the meeting not as the previous Chairman.

Mr. King opened the nominations for the election of officers for the City Council. 
Mr. Stefanini made the motion to table the discussion of reorganizing the Council and adopti on
of council rules until Tuesday January 18th, as the first order of business; and he further moved

ORDER 2022-001 – Upon request of the Mayor to refer the matter to fund and authorize
positions for FY22 including the Director of Community and Economic Development, Human
Resources Director, and Chief Financial Officer to the Finance Subcommittee for review and
recommendation to the City Council (Revised 12/28/2021) 
Mr. Stefanini motioned to refer the matter to the Finance Subcommittee. Seconded by Ms. 
Leombruno. 
Mayor Sisitsky briefly expressed his happiness of being here with the Council. He assured the
Council he will cooperate and work with the Council as a coequal branch of government noting
transparency, respect and civility. He emphasized that if Council members have a question or
concern to not hesitate contacting him or his office. 
He is optimistic that things will be accomplished for the City. In doing so, we must hire the best
people possible to help with the work of the City. He briefly stated that there were a few
positions that were not funded in FY22 Budget and before they can be filled, funding must be
approved. He noted there was a short-fall in the salary for the CFO. In conclusion, Mr. Sisitsky
noted he will attend Mr. Steiner’supcoming meeting of the Finance Subcommittee to review
this request and be available to answer any questions they have. 
Ms. Bryant asked the Mayor if he is asking that the Director of Human Resources position is
being funded as the Council had already cut that in half? Mr. Sisitsky said his office is asking for
5/12th of the annual salary of that position to go from February through the end of June (the
end of FY22).  Ms. Bryant asked if the salary is being increased? Mr. Sisitsky said it is the same
salary as the previous year. She followed up asking about the Director of Community and
Economic Development and CFO funding? It was explained that the Director of Community and
Economic Development would remain the same and there is a slight increase for the CFO’s
salary as noted in his memo to the City Council. 
No further discussion. VOTE 11-0-0: Stefanini, aye; Ottaviani, aye; Stewart-Morales, aye; 
Bryant, aye; King, aye; Steiner, aye; Leombruno, aye; Cannon, aye; Mallach, aye; Long, aye; 
Alexander, aye. The Council agreed to move the request of the Mayor to refer the matter to
fund and authorize positions for FY22 including the Director of Community and Economic
Development, Human Resources Director, and Chief Financial Officer to the Finance
Subcommittee for review and recommendation to the City Council.
