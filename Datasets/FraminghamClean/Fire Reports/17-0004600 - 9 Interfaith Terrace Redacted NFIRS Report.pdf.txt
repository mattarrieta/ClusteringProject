Unit Narrative
On arrival, E3 assumed command at a 2 and 1/2 story wood frame row house with heavy fire
showing from the Alpha side from divisions 1 and 2. E3 directed E5 to secure a water supply
before entering the complex due to a lack of hydrants on the street and L3 to set up on the
Alpha side. E3 stretched a 2" crosslay to the Alpha side slide to begin extinguishing
visible fire. E3 completed an initial 360* inspection of the building and questioned
bystanders as to the location of occupants. It was reported that the occupant of the unit
on fire was a "female with dogs" and she was not accounted for. On arrival Rl was directed
to complete a primary search of the fire unit. E3 encountered high heat while pushing into
the division 1. Command was passed to C2 on his arrival. While working on division 1, E3
located 2 deceased canines and covered them up with a blanket for later removal. E3
continued to extinguish visible fire and overhaul in numerous locations under the direction
of IG. E3 retrieved all equipment, resupplied E3, and was later released by IC.
All resident info and building info was retrieved by FP2.
