INSPECTOR ON SCENE. At approximately 0130 the box to 969 Concord was received. Conditions
were cold weather with winds up to 35+ MPH. Engine 5, Enqine 2, Rescuel, Platform 1 and Car
2 responded. On arrival to a one story wood frame building approximately 30 by 100
(containing 10 occupancies) we had nothing showing. Engine 5 investigated the box at the C
side (rear) of the building and found the water gong activated. A light smoke condition and
an activated sprinkler head were reported by Engine 5 after they gained access to the salon.
Rescue 1 joined Engine 5 with both units using thermal imagers. Heat signatures detected but
no high heat or visible fire detected. Platform 1 was using their thermal imager in the A
(front)of the building. Engine 2 laid a 4" line into Engine 5 and then assited checking
adjacent units on either side of the salon for any fire, heat or smoke condition. None
reported. All three fire companies pulled ceilings looking for extension of fire. None
found. Engine 5 crew pulled a 2" mattydale to wet any hot spots detected. Platform 1 opened
the front door for horizontal ventilation of the cold smoke created by the sprinkler head.
Engine 5 and Rescue 1 exited the occupancy to change bottles and command had Engine 2 take
over the handline from Engine 5 and continue the investigation. Engine 5 and Rescue 1
re-entered the occupancy to join Engine 2. Command (A side) noticed fire venting out of the
front of the roof. A second alarm was requested which consisted of Ladder 3, Engine 3, and
Engine 7. Command changed position to the C (front ) of the building. Platform 1 had set up
in front of the building upon arrival and had thrown the aerial to the roof. They cut a
vent hole near the ridge. A larger volume of fire vented out of the hole and was visibly
burning along the ridge. Engine 2 was at the C side (rear) entrance of the fire using a
handline to attack the fire in the cockloft. Engine 5 crew used a second handline to assist
with fire attack. Engine 1 was dispatched as RIT and set up in the rear B/C corner with the

dispatched as RIT and set up in the rear B/C corner with the RIT basket. The roof in the
front was now noticeably sagging and all crews were ordered out of the building, conditions
deteriorated significantly, with potential roof collapse. All companies switched to a
defensive mode. As the second alarm arrived Engine 3 ordered to RIT, Ladder 3 laid a supply
line to Platforml as they were already set up. Ladder 3 then set up on the othe end of the
building and Engine 7 established a supply line off of Old Connecticut Path to them. Both
aerials were now using master streams to extinguish.

snow squall. A third alarm ordered. Defensive strategy continued until all fire

Narrative
and one sprinkler head going off They opened the business next door but no heat or smoke .
Rescue 1 and engine 5 crew used thermal imager. to check heat in ceiling ,Platform 1 crew
using thermal imager toward front
of salon. They started to pull ceilings then had to exit salon to change air bottles ,that's
when fire started to vent through roof.
They started interior attack but fire to heavy above went to exterior attack.
All doors locked and no windows broken heavy fire seemed to be located in center of building
before spreading
to rest of building. At first the only smoke was coming from Bella sisters salon which is in
the center of plaza. There was no fire visible or
(heat in the habitable space just a fair amount of smoke
building at this time safety wont permit 
Due to the roof falling into the
an interior investigation unless the insurance company will bring in heavy equipment to
excavate site .For now nothing we
saw would lead us to belive this fire is nothing more than accidental in nature
Origin and cause
