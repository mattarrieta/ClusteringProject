Arson Narrative:
ALARM NOTIFICATION-
The investigation team was notified via fire radio communications of a structure fire.
Multiple callers into 911 were reporting a shed up against the back of the building on fire.
WEATHER WHEN FIRE REPORTED-
Approximately 40 degrees Fahrenheit; Cloudy/Light rain; 15mph West winds, gusting to 22mph;
no lightening activity reported.
PROPERTY DESCRIPTION-
The building is a residential condominium with 12 two-story units. The construction of the
building is Type III with noncombustible exterior walls, noncombustible separations between
units on the first and second floor, and combustible interior framing and A-frame roof.
There is no fire sprinkler system in the building. Smoke alarms are arranged to alert only
the unit they are installed in.
The main entrances to the condominium units are on the West side facing the parking lot (A
Side). All of the B Side and approximately one-half of the A Side on the North, faced
parking lots. The remaining A Side, and the entire C and D Sides, faced other buildings
and/or the property line. On the C Side, each condominium unit had an exterior sliding
glass doorway on the first floor that opened to a fenced-in exterior patio area. Between
each of the patio areas was a exterior shed built of combustible construction and appeared to
be separated in half internally for one owner on one half and one owner on the other half.
INVESTIGATION:
FPl Gildea, FP4 Ruiz, FP5 R. Lopez, DAF Haagensen arrived on scene while there was active
fire and smoke, and began canvassing the scene for witness interviews. The investigation
team initially interviewed the female resident of Unit 1708, the three female residents of
Unit 1711, the on-site employee for the property management company, the first arriving fire
company officer, the first arriving police officer, and a few neighbors.
Sherry Wilqoren (adult female, ) stated she was the resident of Unit 1708. She
stated that she had been sleeping when she woke up to a policeman knocking on the door. She
stated there was smoke in her unit, but that the smoke alarms had not activated. She stated
she had not experienced any recent electrical problems in the Unit.
Debbie Izen (adult female, ) stated she was the mother of~and ~(female
children), and that the three resided in Unit 1711. ~ and~stated they were home
alone in the upstairs bathroom when they began smelling smoke and saw smoke out the rear
window (C Side).  They stated they left the bathroom and went into their 2nd floor bedroom to
look out the rear window (C Side).  They stated that when they looked out the window, they
could see flames and smoke in the area of the shed behind units 1710 and 1709. They stated
that one called 911 to report the fire while the other called the mother.
Lieutenant Blaise Tersoni (Framingham Police Dept.) indicated he was working a case in the
area and saw smoke. When he drove into the complex, he saw fire and smoke in the area of the
shed behind the 1700 building from the parking lot and alerted Dispatch via radio.
Captain Brad Smith (Framingham Fire Dept.) stated he was in command of Engine 7 and this was
the first fire company on scene. He stated that, on arrival, from the parking lot he saw
fire and smoke at the shed area behind the building, and that the flames had extended up to

Narrative
A 360-degree exterior observation of the building was conducted from ground level. Smoke
damage was observed at the roof eaves and side roof vent on the Southern portion of the
building. Heat damage was observed to the plastic fences surrounding the exterior patios
behind both Unit 1709 and Unit 1710, with significantly more damage to the fencing around the
Unit 1710 patio. Fire damage was observed on the exterior shed behind Units 1709 and 1710, to
the roof above Units 1709, 1710 and 1711, to the C Side exterior of Units 1709 and 1710, and
to the first and second floor interior of Unit 1710. Portions of the shed behind Units 1709
and 1710, as well as portions of the roof above Units 1709, 1710, and 1711, had burned away.
An exterior observation noted was that the first floor exterior wood trim around the C Side
patio glass sliding doors of Unit 1709, next to the shed, appeared undamaged. This same wood
trim on Unit 1710, an equidistant away from the shed, was heavily fire damaged.
Additionally, the there was a noticeable fire damage V pattern on the B and D Sided of the
shed behind Units 1709 and 1710, with the base of the V near the exterior C Side of the main
building. It was also noted that all initial witnesses of the fire reported that they were
observing the scene from the B Side parking lot area and B Side back patio area.
Derek Skapars (adult male,  ) and Hilary Hawn (adult female, ) stated
they resided in Unit 1710. Hilary stated she had left for work in Natick around 6:30am and
had not been home since. Derek stated that he had returned home late the night before due to
the snowstorm, around tam, and that he had slept late to recover. He stated he woke around
10:30am due to a request by the property management to move both their cars for parking lot
snow removal efforts. He stated he was in the home for the morning, eventually showered, and
left around 1:30pm to have lunch in Natick with Hilary. He stated that there was nothing
unusual observed in the home that morning, including inside the shed, and that there was no
smoke or fire conditions when he left for lunch. He stated he received a phone call from
property management around 2pm indicating that there was a fire in his unit, and immediately
returned home. Both stated they did not smoke, but Derek stated he vaped. They stated that
they had not had any recent electrical issues. Derek stated he was a high-school wood shop
teacher and that he had not been working on any projects at home recently.
Sargent Spahl of the State Police Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit was on scene with an
accelerant detecting canine.
Interior observations were conducted from areas of least damage working toward areas of most
damage. Based on exterior observations, the first and second floor interior of Unit 1711
were observed first, then Unit 1709, then Unit 1710. No significant fire or smoke damage was
observed in Unit 1711, or on the first floor of Unit 1709. The second floor ceiling/roof
area of Unit 1709 had significant fire damage and portions had burned away toward the C Side.
Significant fire damage was observed throughout both floors of Unit 1710 and the C Side
portion roof had burned away. On the second floor of Unit 1710, the extent of fire damage
appeared to be consistent from one side to the other (B Side to D Side), with a lower extent
of damage on the A Side and becoming more severe toward the C Side. On the first floor, fire
damage was to a lower extent from the A-B, A-D and C-D Corners and becoming more severe
toward the B-C Corner. On the C Side portion of the D Side wall, in the first floor Living
Room area, the gypsum board was still mostly attached to the wall. On the B Side wall of
this room, the wood strapping for the gypsum board was exposed and was significantly fire
damaged or burned away. All Unit 1710 circuit breakers appeared to be tripped.

Narrative
tsasea on the eviaence, the investigation team concluaea tnat the ~.rea o~ Urigin was along
the B Side wall in the Living Room, C Side portion of the first floor, inside Unit 1710.
In the Area of Origin there were fire damaged remnants of a television and other electronics.
Along the wall in the Area of Origin were two electrical outlets fed by the same aluminum
wired circuit. This circuit also fed the exterior outlet on the C Side adjacent to the
exterior shed between Units 1709 and 1710. The aluminum wiring going to the inside outlet on
the C Side portion of the Area of Origin had beading on the lower portion wires where the
circuit had separated. The aluminum wiring going to the outlet on the A Side of this wall
separated at approximately the same height but had no beading. The C Side inside outlet box
had more fire damage than the A Side outlet. The interior wiring to the exterior outlet
appeared intact. There were no smoking material remnants found in the Area of Origin. The
State Police canine did not alert to any accelerants in the Area of Origin.
Based on the evidence, the investigation team concluded that there are two possible Cause
hypotheses. Under the first hypothesis, a failure of one of the electronic devices in the
Area of Origin generated sufficient heat to ignite combustibles. Under the second
hypothesis, a failure of the electrical circuit generated sufficient heat to ignite
combustibles. Both hypotheses are classified as Accidental (NFPA 921), and therefore that is
the Classification concluded for this incident. Based on the Accidental Classification, the
investigation team terminated the scene investigation to maintain its integrity for any
further insurance/owner investigation. The team had insufficient evidence to validate only
one Cause hypothesis.
ORIGIN & CAUSE SUMMARY-
Area of Origin: Along the B Side wall in the Living Room, C Side portion of the first floor,
inside Unit 1710.
Cause: Undetermined
Classification: Accidental
