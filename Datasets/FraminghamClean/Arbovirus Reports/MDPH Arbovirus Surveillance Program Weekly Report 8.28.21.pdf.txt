Arbovirus Surveillance Program Report 
Key Public Risk Communication Messages for This Week: 
MDPH has identified 66 West Nile virus positive mosquito samples collected in Barnstable, Bristol, Essex, Franklin, 
Hampden, Hampshire, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth and Suffolk Counties. The populations of mosquito vectors
that transmits WNV and EEE are elevated due to intense regional precipitation events and average temperatures. 
Avoid mosquito bites by using EPA approved repellents, appropriate clothing and avoiding peak mosquito activity
between dusk and dawn. Remove standing water by emptying containers and tarps. 
On 8/26/21 MDPH elevated 17 additional communities to moderate WNV risk. Check your risk levels throughout the
season by visiting our interactive site https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-arbovirus-update For a
detailed list of findings in your community select Arbovirus Results Summary on the main page. 
Please review the 2021 MDPH Surveillance and Response Plan for updates to risk levels and risk messaging.
