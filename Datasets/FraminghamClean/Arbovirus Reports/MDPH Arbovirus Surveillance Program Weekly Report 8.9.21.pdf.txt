Arbovirus Surveillance Program Report 
Key Public Risk Communication Messages for This Week: 
MDPH has identified 30 West Nile virus positive mosquito samples collected in Barnstable, Bristol, Essex, Hampden, 
Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth and Suffolk Counties. The populations of mosquito vectors that transmits WNV and
EEE are above average and increasing due to intense regional precipitation events and continued warm weather. 
Avoid mosquito bites by using EPA approved repellents, appropriate clothing and avoiding peak mosquito activity
between dusk and dawn. Remove standing water by emptying containers and tarps.
