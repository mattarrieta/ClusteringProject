Arbovirus Surveillance Program Report 
Key Public Risk Communication Messages for This Week: 
MDPH has identified four WNV human cases in Middlesex County and 98 West Nile virus positive mosquito samples
collected in Barnstable, Bristol, Essex, Franklin, Hampden, Hampshire, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth and Suffolk
Counties. The populations of mosquito vectors that transmits WNV and EEE are elevated due to intense regional
precipitation events and average temperatures. Avoid mosquito bites by using EPA approved repellents, appropriate
clothing and avoiding peak mosquito activity between dusk and dawn. Remove standing water by emptying
containers and tarps.
