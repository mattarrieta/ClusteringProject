Arbovirus Surveillance Program Report 
Key Public Risk Communication Messages for This Week: 
MDPH has identified 12 West Nile virus positive mosquito samples collected in Barnstable, Middlesex and Suffolk
Counties. The populations of mosquito vectors that transmits WNV and EEE are above average and increasing due
to intense regional precipitation events and continued warm weather. Avoid mosquito bites by using EPA approved
repellents, appropriate clothing and avoiding peak mosquito activity between dusk and dawn. Remove standing
water by emptying containers and tarps. 
Check your risk levels throughout the season by visiting our interactive site [URL: "https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-arbovirus-update"] https://www.mass.gov/info-

Please review the 2021 MDPH Surveillance and Response Plan for updates to risk levels and risk messaging.
