Arbovirus Surveillance Program Report 
Key Public Risk Communication Messages for This Week: 
MDPH has identified 40 West Nile virus positive mosquito samples collected in Barnstable, Bristol, Essex, Hampden, 
Hampshire, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth and Suffolk Counties. The populations of mosquito vectors that transmits
WNV and EEE are above average due to intense regional precipitation events and average temperatures. Avoid
mosquito bites by using EPA approved repellents, appropriate clothing and avoiding peak mosquito activity between
dusk and dawn. Remove standing water by emptying containers and tarps.
