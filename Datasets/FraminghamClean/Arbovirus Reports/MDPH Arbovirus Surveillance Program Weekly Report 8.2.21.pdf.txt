Arbovirus Surveillance Program Report 
Key Public Risk Communication Messages for This Week: 
MDPH has identified 23 West Nile virus positive mosquito samples collected in Barnstable, Essex, Hampden, 
Middlesex, Norfolk and Suffolk Counties. Due to sustained WNV mosquito activity seven communities in Middlesex, 
Norfolk and Suffolk counties were raised to moderate WNV risk. The populations of mosquito vectors that transmits
WNV and EEE are above average and increasing due to intense regional precipitation events and continued warm
weather. Avoid mosquito bites by using EPA approved repellents, appropriate clothing and avoiding peak mosquito
activity between dusk and dawn. Remove standing water by emptying containers and tarps.
