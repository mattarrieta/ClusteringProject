Arbovirus Surveillance Program Report 
Key Public Risk Communication Messages for This Week: 
MDPH identified the first West Nile virus positive mosquito sample collected on 6/29/21 in Medford. Intense regional
precipitation events and continued warm weather will support increased populations of WNV and EEE mosquito
vectors.
