Arbovirus Surveillance Program Report 
Key Public Risk Communication Messages for This Week: 
MDPH has identified four WNV human cases and one animal case in Middlesex County. Additionally, MDPH has
identified 108 West Nile virus positive mosquito samples collected in Barnstable, Berkshire, Bristol, Essex, Franklin, 
Hampden, Hampshire, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth and Suffolk Counties. The populations of mosquito vectors
that transmits WNV and EEE are elevated due to intense regional precipitation events and average temperatures. 
Avoid mosquito bites by using EPA approved repellents, appropriate clothing and avoiding peak mosquito activity
between dusk and dawn. Remove standing water by emptying containers and tarps. 
On 9/10 MDPH raised the WNV risk level to High for 27 communities in Essex, Middlesex Norfolk and Suffolk
Counties. Check your risk levels throughout the season by visiting our interactive site [URL: "https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-arbovirus-update"] https://www.mass.gov/info-
