Policy Statement: 
Employees whose positions are governed by Civil Service Law or collective bargaining
agreement are subject only to those portions of this policy that are not specifically regulated by
law or agreement. 
The existence of this policy does not represent a “contract” for employment between the
employee and the City. 
Policy Description: 
All regular full- and part-time (20+ hours) employees are eligible to receive a longevity bonus of
$200.00 after ten (10) years of continuous service. An additional $50.00 will be added to that
amount for the completion of each additional five (5) years of continuous service. 
Service with the City of Framingham School Department will not be counted towards calculating
longevity when an employee transfers from the School Department to a City Department. 
An employee who elects to take an unpaid leave of absence shall have his/her date of
employment adjusted for the purpose of calculating longevity. Time while out on any unpaid
leave (any type of unpaid leave: Sick, Personal, Educational) does not contribute to the
calculation of continuous service to the City. Unpaid FMLA or Parental Leave is considered
continuous service to the City. 
Employees who have left the City of Framingham, in good standing, and are rehired within a
period of two (2) years, shall be credited with his/her prior service for the calculation of
