Policy Statement: 
Employees whose positions are governed by collective bargaining agreement or Civil Service
Statute are subject only to those portions of this policy that are not specifically regulated by law
or agreement. 
The existence of this policy does not represent a “contract” for employment between the
employee and the City. 
Policy Description: 
A non-school employee, in good standing, who voluntarily terminates his/her service with the
City and is rehired by the City within a period of two (2) years, shall be credited for his/her prior
service for the purposes of longevity and vacation eligibility. This will be done only upon
completion of two (2) years of employment after the date of rehire. At that time, his/her date of
hire, i.e., anniversary date, shall be adjusted to bridge his/her break in service and reflect credit
for said prior service but only for the purposes of longevity and vacation eligibility. Should prior
service have worked on a part-time basis, credit shall be given provided the average hours were
equal to or greater than twenty (20) hours per week over the work period. Said credit for such
part-time service shall be computed on a pro-rata basis. 
Prior service with the City shall be construed to mean any provisional or permanent employment, 
full-time or part-time (20 hours or more), with any department under the jurisdiction of the City
of Framingham. This policy shall not be applicable to seasonal employment
