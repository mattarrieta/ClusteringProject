Policy Statement: 
Employees whose positions are governed by Civil Service Law or collective bargaining
agreement are subject only to those portions of this policy that are not specifically regulated by
law or agreement. 
The existence of this policy does not represent a “contract” for employment between the
employee and the City. 
Policy Description: 
An employee who is terminated due to a reduction-in-force and subsequently is rehired by the
City within a period of two (2) years shall be credited at that time for his/her prior continuous
service for the purpose of longevity and vacation eligibility only. Should prior continuous service
have been worked on a part-time basis, credit shall be given provided the average hours were
equal to or greater than twenty (20) hours per week over the work period. Said credit for such
part-time continuous service shall be computed on a pro-rata basis, however: 
•  Prior service with the City shall be construed to mean any provisional or regular
employment, full-time or part-time (minimum of 20 hours), with any department under
the jurisdiction of the City of Framingham. Seasonal employment will not be recognized
as prior service.
