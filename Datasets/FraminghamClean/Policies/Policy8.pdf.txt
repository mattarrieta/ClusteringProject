Policy Statement: 
Employees whose positions are governed by collective bargaining agreement are subject only to
those portions of this policy that are not specifically regulated by agreement. 
The existence of this policy does not represent a “contract” for employment between the
employee and the City. 
Policy Description: 
The “regular” day of each full-time non-exempt employee shall be eight and one half (8.5) hours, 
which includes a one (1) hour meal break to be taken in the middle of the workday. At the time
of this break, the employee shall remove himself or herself from their work site. Any time
worked outside of the eight and one half (8.5) hour “regular” day will be worked in accordance
with the City of Framingham Compensatory Time Policy. The workweek shall consist of thirty-
seven and one half (37.5) hours of work unless otherwise agreed upon at the time of hire for
those employees identified as less than full-time or as determined by the Department Head. A
Department Head may determine that, based upon the effectiveness and function of the
Department, an eight (8.0) hour work day with one half (½) hour lunch break may be
appropriate. Each full-time non-exempt and exempt employee will be paid for seven and one half
(7.5) hours daily.
