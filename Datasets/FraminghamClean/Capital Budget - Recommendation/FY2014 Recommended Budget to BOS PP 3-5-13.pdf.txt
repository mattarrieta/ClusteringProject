Revenue Estimate
• Weakness:
– Chapter 70 aid increased by $3.3 million has
moderate risk
• If Ch 70 formula not changed estimate has about
10% risk of reduction
• If legislature tampers with formula criteria
estimate has about 30% risk of reduction
• Would require the Legislature add $125M to state-
wide Chapter 70 Budget
• Legislature nervous of impacts of sequester
• Governor’s budget added $226 million to Chapter
70 total budget, supported by a portion of $1.9
Billion in increased taxes
