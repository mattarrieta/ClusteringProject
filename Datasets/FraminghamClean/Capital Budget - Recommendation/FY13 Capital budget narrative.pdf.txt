Capital Budget
Necessary Investment 
to Maintain Town Assets

Overview
A multi-year capital plan seeks to maintain a commitment to the investment in and
upkeep of municipal assets. It also is a commitment to the health of a community; not
just financial, but educational, social and structural. The budget presented here is
just a portion of a longer term capital plan that schedules maintenance and
replacement requirements for equipment, buildings and infrastructure. The FY13
portion of this capital budget is more limited than the last couple of years in an effort
to reduce of the overall cost of the operating budget in light of taxpayer concerns
with the cost of Town government. 
The capital budget recommendations for FY13 total $21.3 million. The project totals 
by fund are: General Fund is $7 million, Water Enterprise Fund is $5.5 million and
the Sewer Enterprise Fund is $8.7 million. One goal that was set in the General
Fund capital budget development process was to limit the size of the budget while
still maintaining the needed investment in capital projects and equipment. Debt
service, the cost of paying the mortgage, so to speak, does have an impact on the
operating budgets of the General Fund, Water Enterprise Fund and Sewer
Enterprise Fund. With the anticipated revenues available for the General Fund
operating budget looking bleak, it is necessary for the services provided to citizens
in the Town to mitigate the debt service appropriation within the operating budget. 
That goal was met by limiting new debt service to $120,426. This will reduce the
budget deficit projected in the Long Range Forecast by approximately $800,000. 
One way interest payments are avoided is using prior year free cash (in FY11). The
Town policy allocates a portion of this end of the year cash balance to be used to
fund capital budget items. This year that allocation is $363,687. 
The second goal of this capital budget recommendation is to invest in projects and
equipment that increase efficiencies, increase revenues, decrease costs or cannot
be repaired. The latter creates a need to rent equipment, but in some cases that the
rental is not available. This budget recommendation is limited to those items. 
The Water and Sewer Department recommended capital budget includes several
critical pieces of equipment, but the primary costs are for replacement of water and
sewer lines and the upgrade of water tanks and backup systems. This includes the
elimination of two pump stations (one at Speen Street) and the replacement of water
and sewer pipes under Herbert, Irving and Loring Streets. Additional funds for the
East Framingham Sewer Improvement and Central Street Siphon are recommended. 
The estimated increase in FY13 debt service is $100,180 for the Water Enterprise
Fund and $161,170 in the Sewer Enterprise Fund.

Putting the Capital Budget Together
In September of each fiscal year the CFO’s office recalibrates the capital budget
database and requires all Divisions to submit a 6 year capital budget request; 
generally within 30 to 50 days. Department staff enters in descriptions, costs, status
of the pieces of equipment to be replaced, or in need of repair. Repairs and
replacements to infrastructure and buildings are entered into the same database
using the same fields for descriptions costs estimates and impacts if not approved. 
Data is collected for projects in all funds: General Fund, Water Enterprise Fund and
Sewer Enterprise Fund. 
The CFO’s Office then reviews the projects using an evaluation model which was
updated in FY11. The criteria include financial impact, complying with legal
mandates, impact on public safety and public health, division and department
priority, whether prior phases were completed, urgency of need to repair or
replace, and impact on service to the public. Based on the results of the evaluation
and final global decisions on ability to fund, the recommendations are presented in
this budget.

Fire Department
The recommendation includes the replacement of Engine 1 which deferred last year. 
An aerial bucket truck, a facilities pickup, the conversion of traffic lights to LED and
the Fire’s Chief’s cruiser were all deferred. In total $550,000 was recommended and
$625,677 was deferred. 
Library
The Main Library had a number of requests this year, however only the Lexington
street handicapped ramp ($425,000) and the study of space utilization ($40,000) is
recommended. Two projects are specifically deferred: the HVAC upgrade and
wiring for digital direct energy controls (DDC) because the Town anticipates
working with the MAPC on a regional energy services contract to upgrade a number
of Town buildings including the Main Library. The projects related to the parking
garage have been deferred to await the results of additional review. 
Building Services
Two projects are recommended for Building Services. The first is the replacement of
75 parking meters with digital meters and the upgrade of the parking pay system at
the Hollis Street parking lot ($53,468). We anticipate additional parking revenue
with these improvements. The second project is the upgrade of the security
management software which services the Memorial Building, the Library, the
Callahan Senior Center, Cushing Chapel and the Danforth Building. This will
include a security card/ID system for Town employees and additional security
cameras. 
Parks & Recreation
The recommended capital budget for Parks and Recreation includes one piece of
equipment ($45,411) and two projects: phase one replacement of mulch below
several playgrounds ($29,550) and the remedy and study of the ice Arena end walls
($65,411). Two additional pieces of equipment and three projects were deferred
totaling $1,050,991. 
Police Department
The Police Department recommendation is the upgrade of electrical wiring in the
police station to the emergency generator in order to handle the power load to the
station under generator power. The project cost is $53,560.

Engineering Department
The one project request for the engineering department, the Saxonville Levee pump
station design, is recommended to be deferred for FY13. The project cost is
$153,500. 
Highway Department
The majority of Highway Department capital project recommendation is the roadway
improvement program at $2.5 million. This is the greatest amount recommended in
more than six years. However it is still just under half the amount necessarily to
keep the Town’s roads in a state of repair. Also included is the FY13 phase of
sidewalk/accessibility improvements at $150,000. Three critical pieces of
equipment are recommended: one major construction truck, one 15,000 GVW dump
body truck used for tree maintenance and one platform body with a lift gate to
transport construction material to work sites. The replacement of eight pieces of
equipment has been deferred as well as $2.7 million of the Roadway Improvement
project is recommended to be deferred. 
Sanitation Department
The recommended capital budget for Sanitation includes one new packer, with a
plow, which was deferred from last year. The replacement of the front end loader
that services the recycle center and the yard waste dump is recommended. This
loader cannot be repaired and no rental is available. The purchase of 68,000 GVW
roll off frame cab and chassis that is used for transporting containers at the recycle
center is deferred for FY13. 
School Department
The most critical project, the study of the Fuller and Farley Schools is recommended
for FY13. Phase 2 of the technology upgrade is included at the requested amount of
$500,000 funded partially with free cash. Three energy efficiency projects are
recommended, all part of phased programs for building mechanical improvements. 
ADA upgrades to sidewalks and ramps, also a phased project, is recommended. 
Replacement vehicles, grounds equipment upgrades, stage curtain replacements, 
floor tile replacements and furniture replacements, totaling $1,484,000 are deferred
again this year. 
Technology Services
Three projects have been requested and all are recommended for inclusion in the
FY13 Capital Budget. An upgrade to the Towns VOIP hardware must be upgraded in
order to work with the current version of the software. Our two virtual environment

servers, out of warranty and under capacity need to be replaced. Finally a system to
digitized building permits and plans is recommended to be funded. 
Town Owned Buildings
Three projects totaling $366,941 are recommended under Town Owned buildings: 
the repair of stairs, stairways and windows at the Pear Street garage. This includes
security cameras that will be tied into the Town Hall security system. The design of a
fire suppression system for the Memorial Building, at a cost of $50,000, is
recommended for FY13. Finally, the replacement of the boiler at Village Hall at a
cost of $83,030, providing efficient heating and saving the Town energy dollars.

Debt versus Debt Service
Debt is different from debt service in that debt is the total cost of a project. The
Towns debt is the total amount of long term and short term bonds issued and the
authorizations that have not yet been issued. In the General Fund the Town has
$114.4 million authorized. The Water and Sewer Enterprise Funds have debt of $116
million and $118.3 million respectively. 
Debt service is the annual cost to borrow that “cash” including the principle and
interest. The total amount needed per year is appropriated in the Annual Town
Budget under the debt category. 
Debt Limit and Debt Service Limit
Like any business or household, municipalities should not carry too much debt. How
much is too much? Massachusetts General Law Chapter 44 Section 10 states that the
debt limit for Towns is 5% of the equalized valuation (EQV). EQV is the state
approved value of all real property in a municipality. The EQV is determined every
two years. The EQV for Framingham is $9.5 billion therefore the debt limit is $477
million. The Town of Framingham currently has $114.4 million in General Fund debt
issued. This is 1.2% of the EQV, well within the state debt limit. 
The Board of Selectmen set the General Fund debt service limit by policy in 2000. 
That limit is 5% of the budget. The FY13 base debt service is $9,991,054. From this
number we subtract $2,510,995, which is the amount of debt service the state School
building authority (MSBA) pays for works done to Cameron, Wilson and McCarthy
schools. The net amount, $7,480,059 is 3.4% of the estimated revenue for FY13. The
projected debt service costs for the new projects and equipment purchases
recommended in this budget for FY13 is $126,295 which would bring the new total to
$7,606,354 or 3.4% of the expected FY13 revenue. This is well within the policy
guidelines. However we do need to look at this issue long term and forecast, at least
for the term of this capital budget, what the impact of all the future requests. We do
this using the “FY2013-2018 General Fund Debt Service Impact” table on page B. 
This table assumes that all of the projects requested for FY14 to FY18 would be
approved and bonded and projects the annual debt service costs at a 4% interest
rate. In FY14 we still remain below the 5% limit at 4.3% if we approve all projects
but exceed the limit in FY17 and FY18 if we don’t limit what we authorize. In the last
five years we have managed new authorizations based on work level and
affordability and will continue to move in that direction using these annual budgets
and forecasts as a guide.

The debt service limit for the Enterprise Funds isn’t as restrictive as the General
Fund. Moody’s Rating Bureau uses the standard for debt and debt service as
“whatever the rate will bear”. However, we have been careful to manage the
amount of debt service built into the rate only to what we need to borrow when we
need the cash and upon completion of projects. Because of the volume of work
required by the state’s consent order, this accounts for a significant amount of debt
service, forcing rate increases, but the town rates are still at the bottom of the scale
compared to comparable communities. We will still look to manage the increase in
debt service as we continue to comply with the state consent order. The long range
forecast of debt service impact for the Enterprise Funds is included the table entitled
“FY2013 – FY2018 Enterprise Fund Debt Impact” on page B-1. 
Debt Service Impact on the Operating Budget
Base debt service includes principle and interest costs for the bonds that have been
issued for completed projects. It also includes the projected debt service costs for
projects that have been authorized but bonds have not been issued (ABU) because
we have not incurred the cost yet. It also includes the debt service for those projects
that have short term bond anticipation notes (BANs) issued but have not been
permanently bonded. The ABU and BAN debt service is bundled in the line
“authorized but unissued” on the Summary Debt Service Impact table. 
Incurring new debt service requires caution. The first year of debt service is less
costly than years two and three because it is just the interest payment for short term
borrowing. In FY13 we could have approved all of the General Fund capital
requests and added $310,716 to the debt service budget. However, that would have
required debt service to increase by $1.9 million in FY14. In addition, we need to
make sure we have the management capability to complete all of the work
effectively. This may be compromised if we have to lay off staff due to budget cuts. 
It is a balancing act, but it can be done responsibly. It is foolish to eliminate capital
expenditures completely in order to reduce debt service and push all available
dollars to salaries and operating costs. First of all it is more expensive in the long
run not to maintain your infrastructure, as we have found out with our water and
sewer consent order. In order to complete the work on time you have to accept bids
and bidders that are available in a short time frame; you don’t have the luxury of
waiting for better price trends. Secondly, spending operating dollars to maintain
failing equipment and inefficient energy systems is a waste and could be more
effectively used.

The Office of the CFO looks forward to working with the Capital Budget Committee, 
Selectmen, the Town Manager and department and division heads to craft a final
FY13-FY17 Capital Budget to bring to the Annual Town Meeting.
