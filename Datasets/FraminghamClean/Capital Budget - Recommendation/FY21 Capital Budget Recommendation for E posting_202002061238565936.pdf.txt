This replacement project addresses two issues. First, the Department is
planning to streamline the fleet so that fire trucks are standardized to the
same manufacturer and specifications. This reduces the costs of
maintaining the fleet because there would be common maintenance
supplies, tools and mechanic familiarity. Second, this project would
address the need to get primary response fire trucks on a standardized
replacement cycle. The Department finds that firefighter safety risks and
maintenance costs accelerate when the apparatus have reached 10-12
years of service. This project also includes the cost to equip the new
truck with the required firefighter tools and hose that a fire engine needs
to meet national fire service standards.

Engine 7 is a 2009 truck built by KME and is a primary response truck. Equipment
This replacement project addresses two issues. First, the Department is
planning to streamline the fleet so that fire trucks are standardized to the
same manufacturer and specifications. This reduces the costs of
maintaining the fleet because there would be common maintenance
supplies, tools and mechanic familiarity. Second, this project would
address the need to get primary response fire trucks on a standardized
replacement cycle. The Department finds that firefighter safety risks and
maintenance costs accelerate when the apparatus have reached 10-12
years of service. This project also includes the cost to equip the new
truck with the required firefighter tools and hose that a fire engine needs
to meet national fire service standards.

The Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division is respectfully Park Facilities
requesting Capital Funding for the Winch Tennis and Basketball Court
Repair Project. This project will consist of grinding and repaving of both
the tennis courts (6-courts) and basketball court; replacement of two
basketball standards; replacement of all 6 tennis standards (and nets); as
well as replacement of chain link fencing around the tennis courts. While
the ownership of these courts is split evenly between the School
Department and Parks Department (3-courts), the Parks Department is
carrying the full replacement of these 6 courts within our capital budget
with the full support of the School Department. 
The expected life-span of these basketball and tennis court is between 10-
15 years, with a number of variables that could increase or decrease the
life expectancy. Variables such as heaving from temperature fluctuations, 
level of usage, fluctuating weather patterns, and wind loads on fencing
that causes the structures to shift, have all led to the increasing
deterioration of these courts. In addition to these factors, these tennis
courts have surpassed the high-end of its life expectancy as these were
originally installed in 1993, making them courts 26 years old. In addition, 
the basketball court has surpassed the high-end of its life expectancy as
well having been installed during the early 1980’s. 
The Winch Tennis and Basketball Courts are utilized by a wide-range of
users throughout the community. Those users include all levels of the
Framingham High School Boy’s and Girl’s Tennis Teams; gym classes
from Framingham High School; various Parks and Recreation programs; 
various resident user groups for both pickup games and local leagues; as
well as local organizations who utilize these courts for lessons and
recreational enjoyment. The location of these courts are also in an
important area as they are the only lit basketball and tennis courts in the
North-side of Framingham as well as the only courts serving Framingham

$58,484 2021D Replace the current Public Announcement system at Loring Arena
$380,598 2021D Demolish and replace various size chain link fence, gates, and guardrail at
various parks properties. 
Justification
The Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division is respectfully Non-rolling
requesting Capital Funding for the replacement of the current public Equipment
announcement (PA) system at Loring Arena. This project will consist of
the installation of new speakers and audio system throughout the rink; 
installation of controls in the press box and office; and overall upgrades to
the PA system used during games, practices, open skate, and all other
events at Loring Arena. 
The current system is 10 years old and was designed to function in the
former rink and is configured as such. In the former rink, sound was able
to reverberate off of the end walls and bounce back into the rink and
spectator sections, providing clear audio for user’s experience. As a result
of the renovations, the material of the end walls have changed, which has
created a challenge in projecting sound throughout the rink. In addition, 
the space has changed with the addition of a second floor with windows
for viewing, installation of windows on the four corners of the barrel, and
reconfiguration of the front first floor. The main challenge is usage during
spectator events. 
The rink hosts around 60 games a season from September through
March, which generates a large amount of revenue for the City and helps
to offset the operational cost of Loring Arena. What we have found is that
during these events when there are spectators in the stands, the PA
system proves to be subpar and is unable to project any announcements, 
including pregame ceremonies and singing of the national anthem. 
Throughout the 2018-2019 season, the Loring Arena and Parks
Department staff members received numerous complaints from players, 
coaches, parents, spectators, Athletic Directors, presidents of leagues, 
representatives from the MIAA, and so on regarding the subpar PA
system. 
When the Department was undertaking redesign efforts for the rink, this
upgrade was considered at the time as a component to the project. 
However, when estimated budgets were presented to City staff, we were
The Parks, Recreation & Cultural Affairs Division is respectfully f  d t  d t k  l  i  i  h  hi h  lt d i  th  Park Facilities
requesting Capital Funding for Phase 1 of the Fence and Backstop
Removal and Replacement Program. The previous fence & backstop
removal and replacement project was funded over 10 years ago, 
increasing the need for funding of this project and magnifying the need for
proper investments. 
Properly maintained parks, including vertical structures, are integral to
neighborhood beautification, stabilization, site usability, public safety, and
maintaining surrounding property values. The "Choose Framingham" 
initiative identifies the fact that "the average distance to a playground or
other recreation area from any single family parcel is approximately a
quarter of a mile." By replacing fence and backstops at park locations, we
are able to ensure proper management and safety of our parks and other
facilities.
In addition to maintaining neighborhood parks and other passive
recreational facilities throughout the City, the Parks, Recreation & Cultural
Affairs Division also maintains all school athletic fields and their
associated fence lines. Parks staff has identified the need to replace
various fence lines due to increased safety concerns that are attributed to
normal aging, tree damage, and regular usage. 
Phase I of the Fence and Backstop Removal and Replacement Program
includes improvements at the following Parks & Recreation maintained
properties:
•Removal and replacement of failing wooden guardrail and deteriorating
fence lines at various Baseball Fields within the Longs Complex;
o Current fences are 4 feet, creating a safety concern for athletes and
field users;
o Deterioration and age of fences have also created safety concerns;
o Missing or heavily damaged wooden guardrail presents safety
concerns as vehicles can access fields and/or facility users can cut
themselves on damaged guardrail;

reliability, as do major repairs, none of which provide a return on
investment, and they are not sustainable with the current DPW facility and
staffing. In addition to daily service for the various Divisions, nearly all
vehicles and equipment are used for the Department’s snow and ice
management program which is particularly destructive to vehicles.
This funding provides ongoing roadway, curb, sidewalk and related
infrastructure rehabilitation and improvements necessary to retain an
overall State of Good Repair citywide, as well as safety and accessibility
improvements. The majority of this work provides roadway resurfacing
such as mill and overlay, stress absorbing membrane interlayer, bonded
wearing course, rubber chip seal, mill and fill and crack sealing. 
Without substantial and appropriate ongoing roadway work, this
infrastructure deteriorates rapidly, costs more to raise back up to a State
of Good Repair, and increases the annual needs and costs for roadway
maintenance, including emergency and other corrective repairs.
