FY13 and Our Future Financial Position
Provide relief for property taxpayers
without a reduction in service
By backing off the 2.5% levy to 1.5% levy the tax
increase is reduced from an average of $144 per
home to $86 per home 
Invest in Education and Public Safety
Full day kindergarten and additional targeted
resources and staff
Additional police and fire staff to provide
increased services
Page 14
FY13 and Our Future Financial Position
 Speed up full funding of Stabilization Fund
 Adding $2.3 million in FY13 means $750,000 will be needed
in FY14 to bring this fund to 5% of the total budget, one year
ahead of schedule
 This will free up room and meals tax revenues of $1.1 million
per year to deposit in the OPEB Trust Fund without having to
cut services
 The Stabilization fund is then sufficient enough to handle
major reductions in state aid or substantial change in the
economy that affects Town values
 Take the first small step toward the pay down of unfunded 
OPEB liability which will mitigate the need for future tax
increase
 Start with $1.5 million and then dedicate $1.1 million from
FY15 forward; this will reduce the unfunded portion of the
OPEB liability and reduce the annual required contribution
