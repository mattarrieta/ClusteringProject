TOWN MANAGER' S REPORT
February 4, 2014
MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES
The Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana (MMJ) Program announced the first 20 Registered
Marijuana Dispensaries approved forprovisional licensure to operate. 4 outofthe 5 licenses allocated to
Middlesex County were issued, but none of them were for locations in Framingham. The 4 licenses
issued in Middlesex were located in: Lowell, Ayer, Newton and Cambridge. The Massachusetts
Department of Public Health has asked 8 of the applicants that were not selected to consider locations in
oneof4countieswherenolicensesweregranted. Thereforethese8areexpectedconsiderarequestfora
license inMiddlesex County. Attheendofthisphased oftheprocess there will likely be28licenses
awarded, leaving 7 available statewide and 1 in Middlesex County. We are interacting with DPH on what
their next steps will be in the process but for the time being it does not appear that a dispensary or
cultivation center will locate in Framingham.
LEGISLATIVE DELEGATION
The Assistant Town Manager and I met with the Legislative Delegation on a variety of topics relating to
Framingham. Highlights included discussions on the revised Commuter Rail Schedule, follow -up on the
Rt. 126 grade crossing, and financial implications and considerations when state agencies purchase local
land. In addition, Senator Spilka agreed to set -up a meeting with Secretary Sullivan on the Birch Road
Wells, and will also be setting up a meeting with DCAM to discuss the Mass Bay campus in Downtown
Framingham. Wewillbeworkingwiththedelegation tocoordinate theirattendance atanupcoming
Board of Selectmen meeting so that various issues can be discussed with the Board in March.
NOBSCOT CHAPEL
TheRequestforProposals toselltheNobscot Chapel hasbeenpublicly advertised. Itwillrunasapublic
advertisement for the next three weeks with proposals due to the town on February 27 An evaluation
committee will review the proposals and rate submittals based on evaluation criteria such as: financial
and operational capability, site and building design, purchase price and additional benefits to the t own
andcommunity. Theprimarygoal ofthis requestisto selectaproposalthatrenovates orreusesthe
building while preserving the cultural, historical, and architectural significance of this landmark.
Additionally, proposals will be evaluated based on their ability to stimulate investment, eliminate blight
andimprove thegeneral areainwhichtheNobscot Chapel islocated. We have reserved allofourrights
to reject proposals which we do not feel create sufficient benefits to either the Town or the appearance of
the neighborhood.

EMERITUS SENIOR CARE— CUSHING PARK
I initiated correspondence to the corporate headquarters of Emeritus Corporation to continue a discussion
wepreviouslyinitiatedwiththelocalEmeritusatFarmPondfacility. Wehaveexpressedinterestin
understanding the plans Emeritus may have in the future for the Farm Pond facility and how those plans
relate to the new its Cushing Park Master Plan. We indicated a desire to consider acquiring all or a
significant portion ofthe undeveloped land remaining atthe location. This was done in concert withthe
Division ofParksand Recreation. Iwillcontinue tokeep the Boardupdated onourprogress withregard
to this initiative.
CONGRESSWOMAN CLARK
Members of the Senior Team and I met with Congresswoman Clark to provide an overview of priorities,
issues and initiatives in Framingham. We will be setting up asubsequentmeeting withthe
Congresswoman concerning CSX related issue and the Rt. 126 /Commuter Rail Grade Crossing and
longer term financing needs of this project.
OPERATIONAL REVIEW OF ASSESSING PRACTICES
We have contracted with MATRIX Consulting to perform a post -audit review ofthe implementation of
therecommendationsthatwereidentifiedintheoperationalreviewoftownassessingpractices. Alan
Pennington, the Consultant who performed the initial review and prepared the report on the town's
assessing practices will be performing the post -audit which will include a presentation of his findings to
the Board at an upcoming meeting. We are also preparing an outline for one ormore tutorial videos on
how our assessment practices are carried out. We will not be able to complete the video until after
abatements are dealt with in February.
HOUSING
Art Robert and I met with representatives from the State Housing and Community Development Division
concerning an action plan on housing. We will have more to report on this in the near future .
FRAMINGHAM PUBLIC ACCESS
I have communicated with the Executive Director of FPAC and provided a copy of our latest agreement
proposed by Town Counsel. The next stepwill be forFPACto respond inwriting tothis draftagreement.
KEEFE TECH ROOF
Ihaveworked out atime linefor decision making inthe RoofProjectatKeefe Tech. JonEvans
the new Superintendent will be prepared to make a presentation to the Board of Selectmen on
February 11 meeting. I will advise Dan Lampl, Bill McCarthy and Audrey Hall of this
presentation.
If the Selectmen find that they support the project the Board does not necessarily need to call a
town meeting —the District Committee's vote to authorize debt for the project will become
effective after 60 days unless one or more of the member communities voted to DISAPPROVE
within that time.
The Board may decide to both support the project and to call an optional town meeting out of
deference to town meeting. My own view is thatifwe accept the need and supportthe project
that calling a town meeting to ratify is basically a distraction from the larger issues that we will
be working of for the annual meeting. But, it really is the Board's call.
If there is interest in calling a town meeting the last meeting where the board could make that
th
decision is March 4

FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAPS
New Flood Insurance Rate Maps need to be adopted by Town Meeting and made part of the zoning by-
law atthis upcoming annual town meeting. The Planning Boardhas beenbriefed onthe changes butthe
Board of Selectmen will need to officially refer the new maps to the Planning Board as part of that
process. Ihave reviewed the new maps withthe DPWand have askedthattheyprepare apresentation for
the Board ofSelectmen in early March. The Board can make the referral to the Planning Board now or
on the night of the presentation. At the end of this process, there are 99 owners of property with buildings
that now will fall inthe floodplain and may be requiredto purchase flood insurance. I am working with
the DPW to identify this 99 owners and communicate with them prior to the presentation.
ROUTE 30 CORRIDOR STUDY
We held a meeting between staff from the Town of Natick and Framingham and representatives of the
MA MPO and District 3 MA DOT to discuss the Rt. 30 Corridor Study. There was also a discussion of
various zoning and land use considerations which the two Towns will collaborate on, some of which
would facilitate one ofthe short term corridor recommendations, ie an extra lane from the TJX Drive to
the Mass Turnpike exit. We will be asking town meeting to consider appropriating some mitigation
fundingto advance furtherengineering reviewofthe corridor studyrecommendations. Ournextmeeting
will be in April.

RE: Constable Application
Date: January 27, 2014
I  am writing regarding Ms. Elizabeth A. Fuller, who is seeking re- appointment as a constable. After a

Ms. Fuller is unfit to hold such a position. Based on the information available, she appears to be a
suitable person to be appointed as a constable. If you have any questions, or would like to further -discus`'
the matter please contact me.

TheFY15 Operatingbudgetpresents a number ofopportunities and challenges. The attached
spreadsheet is a comprehensive look at the FY15 Level Service budget need and the Priority
FY15 Requests. The list is organized by Department, in alphabetical order. Columns two and
three arethe FY15 Level Service Budget and theincremental increasefrom FY14. Columns
four, five and six are the priority request descriptions, the incremental increase of each request
and the number of FTEs associated with each request (if any).
Like FY14, we will continue to report the overall budget in this format when the final
recommendations are made, adding a column for requests that are not recommended. This
format was well received by the Board, other Boards and Committees and Town Meeting as a
good summary of the priority items in the budget, so we will continue to use it.
At the bottom of this chart is the total incremental increase for Level Service, both Municipal
2.65 million) and School Departments ($4.48 million).The total for Service Improvement
Priority requests for Municipal Departments is $1,794. 696, The School Department has not
determined a final priority request at this time.
Priority requests include economic development initiatives, year two of our Police enhanced
staffing program, program efficiencies, restructuring two departments to better handle the Town
wide workload, improving technology and data security, and improved and expanded employee
training and professional development. Municipal Departments, in total, are requesting 17.8
positions for FY15.
There are several budget items that greatly affect what decisions we make for FY15 and beyond.
The Town Manager has convened a working group to look at these variables over a three year
period versus the vacuum of one fiscalyear. Given that we will need to invest, significantly, in
school and town buildings over the next several years, we need to build the financial flexibility at

leastin the nextthree years toput the community in a position to handle these projects. These
items include:
Allocate health insurance savings over three fiscal years (approx. $5 million per year)
Managing the property tax levy to create near term tax relief in anticipation of a large
levy increase and /or debt exclusion for the Fuller/Farley School project
o  MSBA funding for this project is critical, it cannot go forward without it
Allocation of Free Cash over three years: FYI Free Cash is $9.1 million
Allocate portion to Stabilization Fund
Allocate portion to Capital Stabilization fund (new FYI 5)
Allocate portion to OPEB Trust
Amend pro -rata shares to these priorities to create a reserve to mitigate tax
bills over three years
Manage the Capital Budget and corresponding debt service over the long term
o  Again, MSBA funding is critical as it saves $1.5 -$2 million in debt service

Keep spending sustainable; manage within our long term revenue
