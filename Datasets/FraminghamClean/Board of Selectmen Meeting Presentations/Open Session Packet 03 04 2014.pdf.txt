Ispoke to Deputy ChiefHicks. Iinformed himthatwe are intheprocess ofreplacing and removing all ofthe
tub chairs and desk chairs. We should have this completed by weeks end. However, the expected delivery
2/1412/of the sofas has been delayed to 3/14. 28/ I am requested an extension untitl 4 /8/14.
I understand that even if there is a further delay these sofas will be removed by 4/14.8/
Joe has requested a note from the company, American Hotel Register, answering to him about the delivery.
I had mentioned to Joe that after all of the expense and all of the aggravation something good has come out of
this and that is I am now a smoke free hotel.
Thank you for your patience.
I will attend the meeting on March 4.

Subject: Message from supplier
Board of Selectmen,
I  spoke with John Kilgalen at Best Western this morning and it appears they will not be in full compliance with the order
of notice by the deadline of 3/14. 15/ However, the pending delivery and the fact that the hotel made the temporary
no- smoking" policy permanent means that this hotel is already a safer place. I  spoke with the supplier and he assured
me the order has been processed and delivery is scheduled on 3/14. 28/ He admitted there was potential for the
delivery to be off by a few days -  early or late. In short, w do not object to the Board allowing a few more weeks to
fully comply with the order.
I'veattached theletterfrom the Regional Manger iftheAmerican Hotel Register. Anyquestions letme know.

Subj: Alcohol licenses, Deluxe Depot Dinner
Date: February 10, 2014
Donald Levy DOB 07/4427/of 52 Hillside Rd Watertown Ma, is applying for an alcohol
pouring license for the Deluxe Depot Dinner located at 417 Waverly Street. The
applicant has a financial interest in two other restaurants that serve alcoholic
beverages, Deluxe Town Diner in Watertown and Deluxe Station Diner in newton. There
is no information that would cause the police to not recommend the issuance of the
license.
Watertown licensing officials report no violations. Newton Licensing officials report the
Deluxe Station Diner has been open since 2010 and has not had any violations. The
Proposed manager Donald Levy is also one of the owners. Mr. Levy has experience in
the industry having owned and managed several restaurants. Mr. Levy reports that he
will be on premise approximately 40 -60 hours a week.
It appears Mr. Levy is of good character and is recommended for the position after he
receives his alcohol server identification card.
The proposed assistant manager, James L Kaye DOB 06/5903/of 1624 Center Street
Newton MA has experience in the industry. He is currently the manager of the Deluxe
Town Diner. He reports he will spend between 20 -40 hours per week on the premise.
Mr. Kaye appears to be a person of good character and is recommended for the
position after he receives his server identification card.

Transition to Automation ( Phase II Curbside Waste Collection)
It is with great excitement The Department of Public Works brings forth Phase II of the Sanitation
Division's Transition to Automation. During Phase I, in 2011 the Town reviewed its curbside
recycling collection and voted to take a new direction toward a more technologically advanced
collection program. Thisinitiative enabled thedepartment toreview itscurrent operation andmove
from a dangerous outdated technique, to a more futuristic and responsible way of collecting materials.
The town was able to preserve Sanitation Division core services (i.e. Recycling Center Operations and
Yard Waste Drop -Off Site) while saving money on contract cost moving to a single stream bi- weekly
collection with a private hauler.
Now during Phase II, once again, the Department of Public Works is asking for Town Meeting support
in an effort to complete the transition to automation modernizing the way curbside refuse is collected
shifting from a dangerous manual collection style (driver and collector) to a more efficient and safe
fully automated style (driver and mechanical lifting device with carts on the curb).
Currently, the Town of Framingham offers curbside collection of refuse and recyclables to single family
residents and multi- tenant dwellings up to 4 units. For refuse collection, residents are allowed to place
at the curb up to three 35 -gal barrels or bags not to exceed 4o lbs each (105 gal limit for each
household).The division proposes to covert from trash cans and bags to a cart style collection.
Recyclables are collected by E.L Harvey's and Sons, the Towns Contractor, using automated refuse
trucks (driver only).Standard 35, 64, and 96 gal recycling carts were provided to residents at the on-
setofthe automated collection program instituted in 2011 for recycling collection. Thedivision
proposes to assume the recycling collection duties once the contract expires.
The Town spends over one million dollars annually to dispose of municipal solid waste ( MSW)
collected from residents at curbside. Similarly, the costs incurred from contracting curbside recycling
collection with Harvey's averages $537,706 annually (total contract = $ 2,533.688,00).The contract is
scheduled to expire on June 30, 2016.

Page 99
FYI appropriations will enable the department to acquire the necessary equipment to assume the
duties of the curbside recycling collection program once the five year contract expires in 2016. This
presents the Town with an extraordinary opportunity to save in projected contract costs over 10 years
while continuing to deliver exceptional customer service supplying residents with both weekly
curbside refuse and recycling collection.
Thank you,

operation of the initial district school building, including the payment of principal of and interest on bonds, notes or other obligations of the District to finance
such capital costs, shall be determined by computing the ratio which the sum of its resident pupil enrollments on October 1 of the three years next preceding
the year in which the Committee votes to authorize the incurring of such capital costs bears to the sum of the resident pupil enrollments of all the member
towns on October 1 of the same three years; and in the case of capital costs consisting of the payment of principal of and interest on bonds, notes or other
obligations issued by the District, the ratio shall not be changed during the period in which such bonds, notes or other are outstanding, except as provided in
