TOWN MANAGER' S REPORT
February 11, 2014
GIC Communications and Transition Plan
The letter to municipal employees and retirees regarding the transition to the GIC was dictated by the GIC
andwasnotnegotiable. TheHRDepartment madeseveral attemptstonegotiate severalimprovements
that would improve the content and was repeatedly told by GIC that they could not vary from the content
provided by the GIC. This must be the GIC's mechanism ofcontrolling what is said abouttheir program
in the interest ofmanaging whatthey can deliver. I asked the directorto tryand determine whatthe
consequences of noncompliance would be moving forward.
We will complete the overall communications and transition plan for the transition to the GIC and present
it to the Selectmen on March 4 This will include a strategy for communicating separate from the GIC if
necessary for clarity, assuming the absence of consequences. We will conduct a joint municipal and
school coordination meeting, including Supt. Scott and his HR people, on Thursday, February 13 to
review the plan, establish specific time lines, and specific roles and responsibilities. In our interactions
with other communities who have made this transition the cooperation of the HR Department in the
School Department isessential to asmoothtransition ofSchool employees. We needtheir absolute
cooperation in the effort to secure documentation ( marriage and birth certificates) and cannot be
responsible forthe impacts ontheir employees ifthis documentation is not provided. We will coordinate
that effort with respect to municipal employees and retirees.
The Health Fair is being held on the last day of School vacation week in part due to choices made by the
School Department and in the interest if assuring maximum time prior to the close of the open enrollment.
Havingsaidthatthisfairinnottheonlyinformationaloutreacheventthatisplanned. Atotalof18
informational events will be held at different locations and based on discussions this week regarding the
needs of retirees we will probably add to these events:
School Department — 3 events
DPW — 3 events
Police — 3 events — 1 per shift
Fire — 3 sessions
Memorial Building — 2
Library —1
Retirees — 3 — In conjunction with the Callahan Center.
We will be reworking this list and adding locations as well as specific dates for each.

Framingham State Univ. and MA DCR Land Acquisition
DCAMM, on behalf ofFramingham State University, has agreed to take title to the land owned the
Commonwealth andtheDCRaroundReservoir42. This is creating a great deal of concern in the
neighborhood, which has arranged for a neighborhood meeting to discuss the matter on February 18 at
the Main Library. FSU claims to have agreed to taking the parcels for limited "educational and research
purposes" and maintains it has no interest in creating public access to the reservoir short of the Town
asking it to do so. The transfer however, does come with a list of obligations which FSU must fulfill
including actions related ending encroachments and reestablishing wildlife habitat around the shorelines.
I have a copy of those requirements and conducting an assessment.
Natick DPW Worker
The Department of Public Works will take part in the funeral of Michael McDaniel, the Natick DPW
employee killed during a tragic work -site accident. It is anticipated that many Public Works employees
andvehicles from across the state will take part inthis procession. The Funeral Mass will be held at St.
Patrick's Church, 44 East Central Street in Natick at 10:00am.
School Department Event
The Assistant Town Manager, Director ofCommunity and Economic Development and I attended the
First Business and Community Partners Round Table Event hosted by Dr. Scott, Superintendent of
Schools. Theprogram included afocus onbuilding stronger relationships between the School
Department and community partners, as well as thoughts surrounding innovative approaches to engage
studentsandthecommunity. TheMathWorks mentoring programthattakeplaceatthePotterRoad
school was also highlighted.
New Employee in Health Department
I am pleased to report that the Division of Public Health has recruited an excellent candidate for the
position of Sanitarian, Christine Gorwood, who began her employment with the town last week. Christine
has been working as an Environmental Analyst in the Community Assessment Program within the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health's (MDPH) Bureau of Environmental Health for the past nine
years. She has extensive experience working closely with individual communities and their residents. She
recently earned her Masters of Science in Civil and Environmental Engineering /Environmental Health
from Tufts University, where she wrote integral pieces for the Healthy Community Design Toolkit,
created bythe Pioneer Valley Planning Commission. Her experience and expertise in environmental
health will be an essential part of Framingham's Health Department, as she helps move the department
forward into the new age of public health.
Comprehensive Zoning Re -write
The working group tasked with completing the comprehensive zoning re -write has completed the steps
outlined in Phase Iofthis project. The group will present to the Board ofSelectmen, Planning Board and
Zoning Board of Appeals at a meeting in March to present the findings of Phase I and make some
recommendations on how to proceed with Phase II of this project.
Mass Bay Community College
CED Director Art Robert and I met with Mass Bay Community College President John O'Donnell to

Re: Policy on PurchaseOrdersandBid Procedures — First Reading 
Peter L. Mello
Heather C. NYVhite
Christopher L. Brown
In July 2013 the Massachusetts Legislature adopted legislation raising certain bidding
and contracting thresholds under G.L. c. 30B. State law now allows the use of sound business
practices for contracts up to $10,000, raising the threshold for the requirement of receiving three
quotes from $5,000 to $10,000. Additionally, the requirement of a written contract was raised
from $5,000 to $10,000. On January 30, 2014, the Policy Subcommittee voted in favor of
amendments to the Policy on Purchase Orders and Bid Procedures ( " Policy ")to make the local
thresholds consistentwith state law. The proposed Policy attached hereto as Exhibit A is now
being submitted to the full Board of Selectmen for a first reading at the meeting on February 11,
2014. 
I will attend the Board's meeting on February 11 to answer any questions you may have.
Thank 
you.

Town of Framingham
Board of Selectmen
Policy on Purchase Orders and Bid Procedures
Issue date: September 8, 2000
Type of policy: New (  x )  Amendment ( )
Effective date: September 15, 2000
Level: Department ( )  Division ()  Town Wide (x)
Policy Statement
The following policy sets forth the purchase order thresholds for expenditures by all Town
Departments, as well as bid guidelines including thresholds for procurement, preparation of bids,
addendum, bid openings, recommendations for award, and contractual items.
References
M.L., G.Chapter 30B
Special Terms
Best business practices ":  Sound business practices, which should include some type of
informal bidding of goods or services required, in order to determine if goods or services are
being received at a competitive price.
I.  Purchase Orders 
Policy Description _
A. PurchaseOrderThresholds
Page 45
Purchase orders are required only for expenditures in excess of $2,500. No purchase
orders will be processed for goods and services below this threshold.
In order to maintain financial accountability for all departments at the end 'of the fiscal
year, purchase orders in excess of $1,000 are required during the month of June only. All.
items in excess of $1,000 must be submitted to the Purchasing Office no less than ten
10) business days prior to June 30to be encumbered forthe current fiscal year. Items
received after this date will be held until July F and encumbered against next fiscal year.
B. Confirming Purchase Orders
Purchase orders must be obtained prior to purchasing goods or services. No purchase will
be honored or invoice paid if1 a purchase order is submitted after the item has been
ordered ortheworkperformed. Emergency procurements requiring purchase ordersneed
prior authorization from the Division Head and/or approval from the Purchasing Office.
C. Telephone Ordering
Purchase orders required in order to make a purchase over the telephone (i.e.,supplier
will not process order without purchase order number) will be distributed by the
Purchasing Office on an as- needed basis.
II. Bid Procedures
This is not intended as a step -by -step procedure for formally bidding out a product or service;
rather, to be used as a guideline in conjunction with Massachusetts Procurement Laws.
A. Bid Thresholds
As of July X088 the Massachusetts Legislature amended the bid thresholds for
procurement to the following:
For procurement of goods and services under $10 -5,000, cities and towns should follow
best business practices ".
For procurement of goods and services between $10 -, 000 and $24,999, cities and towns
should obtainthree (3) written quotes fromvendors. These quotesshouldbebased upon
a uniform, written scope of services or specifications.
For procurement of goods and services in excess of $25,000, formal bid procedures are
required.
B. Preparation ofBids
Each Department should prepare their own bid packages, including specifications, bid
forms, andotherrelevantinformation. The Purchasing Department will provide you with
Page 46
standard contracts, forms for non -collusion, certificate of authority, tax compliance, and
other relevant bid documents, as well as advertise the bid appropriately. Purchasing will
also be responsible for obtaining the Wage Rates from the Department of Labor for each
project, if necessary, once we are notified.of the intended bid. Please allow seven (7) to
ten (10) working days to obtain the bid rates in your bidding process.
C. Addendum
Attention should be paid to detail prior to submitting the bid packages to Purchasing for
advertising, to avoid unnecessary addendums to the bid package after the initial mailing.
Addendum should be used only in those rare circumstances where an omission in the
original bid package will either nullify the bid or provide the Town with a product or
service that it does not want or cannot use. Addendum will not be issued within five (5)
working days of the bid opening.
D. Bid Openings
Bid openings are conducted in the Purchasing Office at the time and date specified in the
bid package and advertisement. The Division Or Department Head that is responsible for
the bid must be in attendance at the bid opening, or their representative. This assists the
Purchasing Office in answering any questions. specific to the details of the bid from any
Bidders in attendance, and often times provides the necessary witness to the bid opening,
as required by Mass. Procurement Law.
E. Recommendation forAward
After. the bids have been opened and recorded, the Division or Department Head will
more carefully review the bids and make a recommendation for award to the Purchasing
Office. The recommendation for award must be submitted in writing, and will be kept
with the bid file. An award letter will not be issued from the Purchasing Office without
the written recommendation for award from the Division or Department Head.
F. Contracts
All procurements equal to or in excess of $10 -5,000 are required by Massachusetts
General Law to have a contract or agreement between the parties. In order for the
contract to be valid, it must have the following signatures in the following order:
The successful Bidder
The Chief Procurement Officer

parties if such cause arises. Notice of termination will be sent out by the Purchasing
Office upon receipt from the Division or Department Head of a written recommendation
for termination of the contract and the reasons for termination. If the Division. or
Department Head intends to award the bid to the next lowest responsible Bidder, he /she

Re: Designer Selection Procedures — First Reading 
Peter L. Mello
Heather C. White
Christopher L. Brown
The Designer Selection Law, G.L. c. 7C, § §44 -57, requires municipalities to adopt local
designer selection procedures prior to contracting for design services for building projects in
accordance with state statute. On January 30, 2014, the Policy Subcommittee voted in favor of
proposed Designer Selection Procedures ( "Procedures ").  The Procedures were drafted based
upon themodel procedures published bythe Massachusetts Inspector General. The model
procedures serve as an excellent starting point while giving municipalities flexibility to modify
specific provisions to reflect local practice and utilize alternative options as long as they are
consistent withthe statute. Theproposed procedures attached hereto as ExhibitAinclude the
text of the model procedures except where tracked changes are shown. The tracked changes are
suggestedmodifications specific toFramingham. TheProcedures arenowbeing submittedto
the full Board of Selectmen for a first reading at the meeting on February 11, 2014.
I will attend the Board's meeting on February 11 to answer any questions you may have.
Thank you.

Re: Policy on Appointment of Constables —First Reading 
Peter L. Mello
Heather C. White
Christopher L. Brown
It was recently brought to the attention. of the Policy Subcommittee that certain
constables are not submitting bonds, annual reports, and fees to the Town as required by state
law. On January 30, 2014, the Policy Subcommittee voted in favor of amendments to the Policy
on Appointment of Constables ( "Policy ")to clarify these requirements and the Town's
enforcement mechanisms. Theproposed Policy attachedhereto asExhibitAisnowbeing
submitted to the full Board of Selectmen for a first reading at the meeting on February 11, 2014.
State statute requires constables to file annual reports with the Town detailing services
made and fees collected. Aportion ofcivil service fees must bepaidtothe Town. Aproposed
form for submission of the annual report is attached hereto as Exhibit B. Requiring constables
to submit their reports on this form should promote consistency and ease the administrative
burden of receiving and reviewing reports. Additionally,)have revised the standard
appointment letter to refer to the requirements of submitting bonds, reports, and fees to the
Town. The revised appointment letter is attached hereto as Exhibit C.
While the revisions to the Policy would create greater clarity with respect to the
requirements and enforcement mechanisms, the Policy currently in effect gives the Selectmen
Dedicated to excellence in public service -

the authority to take disciplinary action, including termination of appointment, for cause. Cause
may include failure to Comply with the requirements of state law, or local policy. As requested, I
have drafted a sample notice of hearing, attached hereto as Exhibit D, for the Board's
consideration for issuance to any constable who is not in compliance with applicable law,
including failure to submit bonds, reports, and/or fees.
I will attend the Board's meeting on February 11 to answer any questions you may have.
Thank you.
