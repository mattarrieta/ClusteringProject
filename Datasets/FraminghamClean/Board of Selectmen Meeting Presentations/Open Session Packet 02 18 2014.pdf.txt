Re: FY15 Budget Workshop
The attached comprehensive budget grid is our tool for the Budget Workshop that will take during
Tuesday's meeting. The gridis an expansion ofthe previous spreadsheetyou receivedforthe budget
requests. Sixcolumns havebeenaddedtoitemizethecurrentrecommendations andthecurrent
deferrals.
As part oflastweek's presentationwe described apotential three yearbudgetplan. The preliminary
budget recommendations in this attachment follow that plan. One goal, aside from the programmatic
and policy goals of this budget, is to invest $1 million in municipal services and $1.2 million for School
rebuilding; on a base of level service budgets. We are very close to that goal. You can see from the
totals at the bottom we are within $11,000 ofthe municipal department target and right on the School
target. There are some final discussions with Departments that are ongoing. Note thatthe investment in
the School district is part of a two year plan totaling $2.3 million.
Savings in health insurance are targeted at reducing the levy increase from 2.5% to 1.25% and the
strategic investment in Schools and Municipal services.
The revenue assumptions for the tax levy are a 1.25% increase in FY15, FY16, and FY17. New growth
isassumed atan annual increase of8% inFY15, 9% inFY16 and 8% inFY17. FY15 Local aidis
assumed at a 7% increase for Ch. 70 Aid and 1.5% increase for Unrestricted General Government Aid.
The Governor's current recommendation is about $505,000 less than this, total, but the Legislature has
made a very public commitment to increasethat. Local receipts assumes good growth in meals tax and
building permits.
Free cash is focused not on general use but for the Stabilization Fund, OPEB Trust, Capital Stabilization
and a portion into a tax burden reserve of reduce the risk of a swing in tax burden to residential
taxpayers.
If you have any questions or need additional data, please don't hesitate to email prior to the meeting so
we can assemble it for Tuesday.
