Dear Town Official, Town Meeting Member, and Taxpayer,
The Fiscal Year 2017 General Fund Operating Budget outlined and presented herein represents the third and
final year of athree (3) year budget plan that has represented aturning point for the Framingham community.
During the prolonged period of economic down turn we worked diligently as ateam to identify shared strategies
and shared sacrifice to manage the ability of the Town government to deliver the services residents and
businesses require against a very significant decline in both the revenues available to town government and the
ability of our taxpayers to provide them. Throughout that period Framingham town government made difficult
choices from year to year but always with a view towards what was eventually sustainable over the long haul.
That ability to look at our budget on a sustainable, multi-year basis was further strengthened by our decision to
transition our employees and retirees to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts group health insurance program.
That decision exceeded our expectations in Fiscal Year 2015 and the premium increase in Fiscal Year 2016
essentially kept us on-track with our projected savings. We are pleased to report that with what has been
released by the MA Group Insurance Commission we are on track to exceed the original estimate of $18 million
in total savings over 3 years.
Driven in part by those anticipated health insurance savings, the Fiscal Year 2017 Budget represents the final
year of an effort to take athree (3) year view of our budget and service delivery obligations. We are pleased to
report that we more than achieved our goals of moderating tax levy increases for residents and businesses. As
we prepare for the FY 2017 budget we remain focused on achieving our ultimate goal of keeping the total three
year increase in the property tax levy to under 3.75% - or an annual average of 1.25%. We do need to approach
the FY 2017 budget with attention to sustainability, however, due largely to the fact that FY 2015 and FY 2016
each resulted in tax levy increases of less than 1.25% With this opportunity we should be thoughtful and
forward-looking in the way we manage our budgets. This is particularly important in light of some challenging
capital building projects, including a new, additional school building, coming our way as early as 2017 and
2018.
The three-year budget policy and strategy intended to achieve the following goals:
• Tax Payer Stability and Relief: Based largely on the strength of savings in health insurance as a result
of our move to the MA Group Insurance Commission health insurance program, we should pursue a
goal of limiting the annual increase in the Town's property tax levy to an average increase of 1.25% in
each of the next three years, FY15, FY16, and FY17. This is one half of the maximum 2.5% increase in
the levy from year to year authorized by State law. We were successful in achieving this goal in FY
2015 and FY 2016. In fact, the levy increase in each of these years fell below the target, leading to a
recommendation that we increase the property tax levy by 1.75% in this budget for FY 2017 in the
interest of sustainability of budget revenues. Even at 1.75%,the total levy increase will be less than the
3.75% three-year increase which was the original target.
Page 6
• Stabilizing Shares of the Tax Levy between Residential Taxpayers and Commercial Industrial
Taxpayers: The Town's taxable property valuation is 77% residential, and 23% is commercial and
industrial. The Town has historically shifted the tax burden from residential taxpayers to
commercial/industrial taxpayers. The Town has traditionally shifted the maximum amount authorized
by state law. This has left the residential taxpayer vulnerable to massive increases in residential tax bills
when residential values climb faster than commercial and industrial or, as was the case during the
recession, if commercial and industrial values drop faster than residential. The three year goals we have
adopted will strive to maintain the current split in shares of the actual property tax levy at the current 60
percent residential and 40 commercial industrial. In achieving this goal in FY 2015 and FY 2016 the
Board of Selectmen moved further off the maximum shift from residential taxpayers to commercial
taxpayers creating an important buffer in the event of either asudden escalation of residential values or a
sudden decrease in commercial values.
• Hit the Highest of our High Spending Priorities: The FY 2017 budget largely seeks to maintain
services at current levels following investments in Police, Public Health, Facilities and, most
significantly in Education, during FY 2015 and 2016. These investments in Education totaled 13%over
that 2 year period and the recommended 4% increase in the Education budget for FY 2017 will result in
a total increase in our funding for education of 17% during the three year period FY 2015 to FY 2017.
We seek to maintain those levels of services through the end of FY 2017.
• Prepare for Major Capital Projects Beginning in FY 2017: The budget plan seeks to maintain our
current levels of financial reserves but also builds anew Capital Spending Reserve to help fund a
portion of capital building projects that may require voter approval of a significant property tax increase
(through what is known as a Debt Exclusion ballot question). We anticipate that this Capital Spending
Reserve could reach $4.0 million by the end of FY 2017. Significantly, we believe that the goal of
taxpayer stability and relief articulated above will greatly enhance the likelihood of taxpayer acceptance
of these capital building projects, including a new school facility to accommodate growth in enrollment.
We made a $2,284,000 first year down payment into this capital fund in FY 2015 and added another
$999,000 as part of the FY 2016 budget. We plan to add another $1,000,000 to this capital reserve fund
in FY 2017, thereby achieving the 3 year goal of $4,000,000.
As you review the material presented below I hope you will appreciate the deliberateness as well as the
discipline and focus with which we seek to manage the valuable financial resources to which you entrust us
each year.
Sincerely,
Robert Halpin, Town Manager

Executive Summary
This year the Administration is preparing two budgets. The first budget is the
recommendation of the Town Manager and CFO, which we will call the 1.75%Budget.
This title refers to the increase in the base tax levy of 1.75%. The second budget is the
request of Town Meeting at the 2015 Fall Town Meeting for a budget that increases the
base tax levy by 1.25%. We will refer to this as the 1.25% Budget. This is the first time
the Administration has prepared two budgets. The Town bylaw requires the Town
Manager and the CFO to present "the" budget recommendation to the Finance
Committee and Town Meeting. Thatrecommendation is the 1.75%Budget proposed in
this document.
Both budgets are balanced, but the 1.25% budget requires reductions to both School and
Municipal Department operating budgets in order to achieve that balance. The FY17
Operating budget recommended by the Administration has a total revenue increase of
4.2% and a total expenditure uzcrease of 4.1%. The School Department budget is
recommended to increase $5 million or 4.3% to a total of $120,731,231. Municipal
Departments in total (including town-wide snow and ice spending) increase $1.37 million
or 2.3%. This includes the addition of 3.5 FTEs, a$250,000 lease payment fora 5 year
technology lease, and $160,000in operating budgetincreases(some one-time). This
budget is presented in detail in the narratives and budget documents that accompany
this narrative.
The FY17 Operating budget requested by Town Meeting has a total revenue increase of
3.9%and expenditure increase of 3.8%. The only difference in revenue from the budget
described above is the base levy increases 1.25% instead of 1.75%. This is an $880,000
lower amount of revenue. First centralized budgets in Unemployment and Worker's
Compensation were reduced acombined $105,000 from the FY16 amounts. The positions
and operating budget increases in Municipal Department budgets are removed (with the
exception of the production assistant in Media services and the parking enforcement
Officer in Police). Specifically, Municipal Departments are cut by $553,127 from the
1.75% levy budget, and $356,638 below level service. The School Department budget is
$120,400,308, an increase of $4.6 million or 4% ($331,000 below 1eve1 service) over the
FY16appropriation. Municipal Departmentsincrease$481,557or.8% over the FY16
appropriation.
In both budgets funds are set aside for the Technology lease to upgrade the Town 1oca1
area network, firewall, VOIP phones and infrastructure. This is part of a state contract
incentive that we would be stupid to pass up. The Town has the ability to procure and
install equipment and technology infrastructure that would cost hundreds of thousands
of dollars more if packaged separately. The lease has no interest over afive year period
~R/;Nli'~~~HI~M

with a$1 buyout at the end of that term. Given that we are embarking on an information
transparency initiative that is heavily dependent upon robust technology and citizens'
ability to use our technology to access our data, it is critical to engage in this lease.

The revenue estimate for both budgets is identical with the exception of the base levy
increase.

In both Property Tax estimates new taxes for development growth total $1.7 million. It
also includes an appropriation from the FY16 tax overlay account that carries the Tax
Burden Reserve forward to FY17. More on the Tax Burden Reserve in the expenditure
section.
State aid includes Chapter 70 Education Aid at a7% increase ($40.4M) and General
Government Aid at a4.3%increase ($9.56M). Charter School reimbursements and
assessments are in flux at this point so we keep them as forecasted in the original revenue
plan and wait until the legislature has passed its budgets to see what the final outcome is.
Last year these two items changed three times in the course of budget development. The
remaining components of state aid are exemption reimbursement and SBA debt service
payments which remain essentially the same as FY16. State aid is estimated at the same
amount for both the 1.75% levy and 1.25% levy budgets.
Local Receipts is a category of revenue generated in Town and is estimated at $22.1
million for both budgets. These include local taxes: vehicle excise, hotel and meals taxes.
In FY17 we expect to generate $9.6 million from these three revenue sources. User fees,
fines, licenses and permits should generate another $5.7million in revenue. Payments in
lieu of taxes, investment incomes, space and ice rental and other miscellaneous revenue
total $5.8 million. New this year is $740,000 in revenue from cable company payments to
support the Government and Education cable TV channels. These revenues can only be
used to operate the cable TV channels.

Enterprise Indirect revenue is the overhead charge to the enterprise fund for the Water
and Sewer Departments. A number of the managers and staff that help support water
and sewer operations are funded from the General Fund. The portion of that time and
effort dedicated to that fund can be charged as overhead to the Enterprise Fund. This
revenue source totals $3.07 million for both budgets.
To help reduce the base tax levy we use $3.5 million in free cash. Free cash is the ending
bank balance of, in this case, the FY15 financial operations. This balance is certified by
the Department of Revenue each year. The FY15 free cash balance is $11.45 million. One
million is recommended to be appropriated to the Athenaeum project as it was received
from a developer of the Saxonville PUD project. The remaining $10.5 is available for
expenditure. However this is not a recurring revenue source at the $10-$11 million we
have seen for the last couple of years. We have had a couple of sizable one time revenues
in the last few years and employee retirements that have generated savings in the course
of the year. Free cash has dipped as low at $1.2 million, so we must be prudent and
careful in how we use this revenue source. The use at this level was planned for a three
year budget cycle to create tax relief. We are at the end of that cycle. In total we use $5.5
million infree cash -$2million is appropriated to the Stabilization Fund, the Capital
Stabilization Fund and the OPEB Trust Fund.
The remaining $65,000 in revenue is from parking ticket revenue and the Consumer
Protection Fund.
Expenditure Summary
Note: there is a comprehensive document called t12e Global Bicdget Summary that
explains the both expenditure budgets and their relationship to the FY16 budget and
the level service budgetsfor FY17. This document begins with municipal
departments listed alphabetically, then the Schools, and finally all the centralized
support costs. Thisfive page document is available online under the 2016 ATM
warrant information and contains eve~Jthing a Tozvn Meeting member should need
to make decisions. The detailed budget pagesfor each department and cost item will
help answer any detailed questions. As always the CFO's Office and the Divisions
and Departments themselves are available in advance ofand at Tozvn Meeting to
answer questions regarding tl~efinances and operations of departments.

Centralized Costs
Centralize costs include reserves, debt service, retirement fund allocation, insurances
payroll taxes, state assessments and tax overlays. These items are the same for both the
1.75% Administration recommendation and the 1.25%Town Meeting request.
The largest centralized cost is health and dental insurance. The budget amount is $30.7
million. Ninety percent of this appropriation is health insurance premiums for the GIC.
The remainder is dental insurance, life insurance, wellness program and administrative
cost. We anticipate a premium increase of about 6-7%,although alot will depend on
how employees migrate to and from plans at open enrollment.
Unemployment and Workers Compensation are decreased to levels that better align with
spending over the last couple of years. Although last year was a big slip and fall year
because of the winter, most employees have fully recovered and are not continuing cost.
Property/Liability Insurance is increased by 9% in anticipation of this year's claim
activity. We could expect similar increases over the next couple of years given the Main
Library claim and the School water damage claim. The Administration will continue to
evaluate how best to manage premium and claims experience across carriers to mitigate
cost.
Retirement is funded according to a state approved actuarial schedule that pays for
current retirement costs and a portion of pension liability. The appropriation increases
by 4.5%. The schedule achieves full funding of the pension liability in 2030. In the
Retirement section of the budget we also add $751,710 to the OPEB Trust Fund allocated
from Free Cash. While this does not fully fund the annual payment schedule for the
OPEB liability, every dollar we add reduces the overall liability and earns money that is
credited against the liability. The long term plan is to begin fully funding the annual
required contribution for OPEB once the Pension liability is fully funded in 2030.
Debt Service is $13.5 million, an increase of about $2.1 million. This supports the capital
projects currently underway or already completed. A small portion of the BAN interest
budget is for capital project in the pending FY17 Capital Budget. We cap the amount of
debt service to 5% of the total budget. Every year we evaluate how much we can get
afford and how much we can physically get done and reduce requests to fit within the
budget.
Level Service Department Budgets
The level service budget is the funding amount needed to support the same staffing and
operating level as the prior fiscal year. In some instances department budgets go down,
due to staff turnover, or one-time costs from FY16 not included in the FY17 budget. In
some cases the service provision becomes more efficient or service delivery is changed to
FR,~i~~iI(°~~FiH(vi
Page 12
save money as in the case of the Sanitation Department which saves $348,640 by
changing recycling collection from a contracted service to collection by employees.
In most cases, however, the cost of service increases. For Municipal Departments overall
the level service increase is $986,212 or 1.7%. The total Municipal Department budget,
including town-wide costs for snow and ice removal is $60.4 million. The School
Department level service increase is $4.6 million or 4%. The level service budget total is
$120.36 million. [Note: cable revenue of $370,000 is added to the School budget for the
level service amount of $120,731,231 in the global summary document].
1.75% levv Administration Recommendation
The budget recommended by the Town Manager and the Chief Financial Officer is a
level service budget plus some specific changes to four departments that will improve
the services provided: Media Services, Veterans Services, DPW and Police. The total
increase for these departments is just about $200,000 for the year. Media Services adds a
Production Technician to bolster production capacity for the Government channel. The
revenue for this position comes from the cable access fees and is dedicated for
Government Channel services. Veterans Service adds hours to a part time position to
make it full time. This will provide afulltime Asst Veterans Service Officer to help
handle the increasing caseload of veterans and the heavily bureaucratic process of
reporting benefits to the state Veterans Affairs office for reimbursement. In DPW we are
adding an electrician to take over the management of streetlights and traffic signals from
the Police Department, which current manages repairs via a service contract. Traffic
signals are increasingly operated via software and sensors and DPW has been managing
the upgrade of intersections as part of the roadway improvement plan. Many
municipalities manage streetlights, traffic signals and fire alarms in acentral department
under DPW. Finally, we add a second Parking Enforcement Officer, a civilian position,
in the Police Department to increase adherence to parking regulations and rules, both
downtown and in neighborhoods. We anticipate this position wi11 increase parking
revenues by at least $25,000 in FY17 and more in subsequent years.
1.25% Levy Town Meeting Requested Budget
The reduced revenue from alower base levy means budget reductions, even from level
service amounts. Municipal budgets are funded $356,683 below even level service. This
means any additional positions and resources are eliminated; operating budgets are
reduced to the same amount as FY16, which means fewer maintenance, repairs and
clean-up can take place. For example: the Highway Department operating budget is
$116,5291ess than FY16. This meansfewer crosswalks getrepainted, fewer guard rails
get repaired, potholes dorit getfilled and street sweeping doesrithappen proactively.
F~,~~~!~~~H~~
Page 13
The impact of street sweeping means that road debris streams down the storms drains
and now has to be disposed of more expensively as hazardous waste. In this case, as in
many cases with municipal operating budgets, the budget cuts doritactually save money
but lead to more expensive alternatives.
The Parking Enforcement Officer is included in the budget version because it actually
generates revenue. The Production Coordinator in Media Services is also recommended,
since the revenue allocated to this budget can only be used for the Government Channel
production. However the electrician for the streetlight merger, and the half a staff person
in Veterans Services are not included in this budget in order to get the bottom line down
to the lower revenue estimate due to the lower levy increase of 1.25%.
The School budget recommended at this lower levy is $120.4 million a4% increase, as
opposed to a4.3%increase in the 1.75% levy. The difference is $331,000 which is offset
by the addition of the Education Channel cable access funds. The School budget would
still need to be reduced as the cable access funds cannot be used simply to supplement
the lower budget.
New>Cable Revenue: Education and Government Channels
The three cable companies in Framingham provide a quarterly amounts, based on video
revenues, to fund cable TV channels for Government use, Education use and Public
Access use. We generally refer to these as the Government channel, the Education
channel and Framingham Access T`V(also FPAC). The revenue received by the Town
now is deposited into a holding account to be appropriated by Town Meeting. $370,000
is allocated to each of the channels for a total of $740,000 in additional revenue and
corresponding expenditure. There is also an allocation of 40% of net Cable PEG Funds to
the Framingham Public Access Channel that will appear in a separate line of the budget.
Tax Burden Reserve Carry Forward
The Tax Burden Reserve is an amount of money set aside in the overlay section of the
budget(non-appropriations) that can be used to mitigate the impact of changing
property values on tax bills. If property values of the residential class increases more
than commercial class then tax burden shifts to the residential class. By reducing the tax
burden reserve amount, we lower the levy and reduce the impact of that tax burden shift.
We try to keep the shares of tax burden at 60%residential and 40%commercial even
though the total values are 75%residential and 25% commercial. Changing burden
shares from moderate property value swings does more to increase or decrease tax bills
than the increase in the tax levy due to the budget. To create tools like this and
continued management of the tax burden shares to a consistent number means better
management of tax bills for tax payers. In FY16 we did not use the Tax Burden Reserve,
so it stayed in the overlay account. We will re-appropriate those funds from the overlay
F13~ ~~li i(~GFil~(vi
Page 14
account to the FY17 Tax Burden Reserve. We are not raising new tax revenue to fund the
Tax Burden Reserve for FY17.
Technolo~v Lease Pavrnent
Both budgets include $250,000 for year one of the five year technology lease. This lease
will be aseparate article in the Town Meeting Warrant because it is a contract of longer
than three years. The substantial upgrade to town technology, including the local area
network, firewall, VOIP phones and peripherals, comes at an incredibly favorable cost
and alease agreement with no interest.
Caution on Revenue/Expenditure Assumptions
This budget assumes that the Governor'srecommend state aid prevails through the
legislative process. Many more communities received almost no increase in Chapter 70
aid than those who received a healthy increase. The Governor's budget intends to "close
the gap" for those communities who have historically been under the Chapter 70 target
share. The Legislature may decide to close less of that gap and spread the amount across
more communities. We will have to watch to see if either policy or politics will prevail.
Health Insurance is budgeted conservatively. A lot will depend on which health plans
employees choose over the next couple of months. Health plan rate increases are not
universal. We have been lucky in that the plans the majority of our employees enroll in
have been among the lower cost plans.

Town of Framingham
2016 Annual Town Meeting 
Financial Articles 4- 24
Background
This is an annual article that authorizes the existence of the above revolving funds
with expenditure ceilings for FY17. This article also recommends a new revolving fund
for the Department of Public Health entitled the Public Health Education and Training
Fund. This new fund will receive new fees to be charged for new important health
education trainings conducted by the Framingham Department of Public Health, such
as food safety training for restaurants, first aid and CPR training, mental health first aid
training, tobacco compliance and cessation efforts.
Article 6- FY2016 General Fund Budget Adjustments
To see if the Town will vote to determine what sum or sums of money the Town will
appropriate and raise, or transfer from available funds, for the operations of the Town
of Framingham, including debt and interest for Fiscal Year 2016 (July 1, 2015 —June
30, 2016) and to see what budgets for Fiscal Year 2016 will be reduced to offset said
appropriations.
Pass any vote or take any action in relation thereto.
Draft Motion for Article 6:
move that the following FY2016 budget adjustments be made:

From
$2,848
$150,000
$152,848
Background Material for Article 6:
The transfers listed above are the first draft of final adjustments for FY16. The transfer
into Medicare Tax from Unemployment is needed due to the increase in staffing over
the last two fiscal years. While we generally increase this line item 5% per year, which
should accommodate growth in employees and assumes some turnover in positions to
lower pay. The trend over the last two years is slightly higher than 5% so we have
adjusted the FY16 amount upward. The change in the Clerks stipend is an annual
adjustment that we should have included in the salary adjustments in the fall Special
Town Meeting. It assumes: a 1%COLA increase for FY16, as was voted at the fall
Special Town Meeting; a 2% step which is the standard step increase for the non-
bargaining salary schedule; and funding for 52.4 weeks versus 52 weeks, which is the
actual number of funding weeks in the fiscal year. This change is in line with the
salary changes in the non-bargaining classifications, it just needs to be voted
separately by Town bylaw.

across fiscal years. FY17 EDIC budget request shows a 10%increase. The cost drivers
include:
The requested funding level reflects an increase of $11,500 from FY16. Past and
planned EDIC activities often extend beyond the June 30 deadline fixed in municipal
budgeting. The EDIC budget, when implemented as a separate appropriation, will
allow for greater program flexibility. The EDIC program will still be developed and
coordinated in cooperation with the Community and Economic Development Division.
The EDIC is executing a work plan derived from the Economic Development Self-
Assessment(EDSAT). The EDSAT provides a roadmap for the Town, identifying
opportunities to improve competitiveness and attractiveness as a location for business
investment and job creation.
In FY17, the EDIC plans to focus on the following activities:
• A significant increase in the cost of an annual subscription to Costar, an online
database of commercial and industrial properties the EDIC has shared with the Town
Assessor's office. The EDIC provides this resource to help the Division provide site
selection assistance to companies interested in Framingham. The vendor has
substantially increased subscription costs, which has led the Town Assessor end its
subscription in FY17. On behalf of the EDIC, the Division will research lower-cost
alternatives and pursue a viable, lower-cost alternative. This budget ensures
continued access to Costar if no alternative can be found.
Providing $5,000 in funding to Metrofest 2016. For the past two years, the Town's
Bowditch Field has hosted this major regional arts, music, and food trucks festival.
Organized by the Metrowest Visitor's Bureau, the event attracts thousands of visitors
— potential residents as well as potential businesses - to Framingham. EDIC
sponsorship for this event —proposed to be shared with the Parks and Recreation
Division —will raise the Town's profile with event visitors, vendors, and staff.
A newly-required, $700 cost of archiving the EDIC's web site and social media
accounts.

ePlus is currently our Cisco VAR (Value Added Reseller). During a meeting with our
ePlus account representative to discuss our capital budget, we learned of similar
projects they've done with Brookline, Melrose and Burlington. After learning of the
cost savings and details of the projects, we decided to request a proposal for
Framingham.
Savings: The cost savings for hardware is $220,000 versus doing smaller individual
projects over the next 5 years. All of the equipment in this project would need to be
replaced in the next 1-3 years and would have been included for consideration in the
capital budget. Additionally, by bundling the services we will save on installation and
project management fees compared to doing several smaller projects. Cisco also
offers aggressive pricing and incentives in the form of additional equipment when
purchasing in bundles. The potential staff time and effort savings this project provides
will be from a reduction in budgeting work for operating and capital, and less hardware
failures resulting in troubleshooting and downtime.
Technical Benefits: This upgrade allows us to provide a 10GB uplink speed to all of
our locations and to the wiring closets in each building. Currently these links are all
1GB uplinks. The core switch is also capable of 40GB speed to future-proof us for the
lifespan of the equipment. The project includes a phone refresh and will allow us to
increase the speed to the desktop to 1GB from 100MB; the majority of the phones
currently installed are the original phones installed in 2005. Also included is the ability
to provide wireless coverage in all buildings, including guest Internet access. We are
doing a firewall refresh that will add second generation firewalls that are better
equipped to handle spam, spyware and crypto viruses, providing better insight into our
network security to protect our digital foot print. We are also including Cisco's
emergency responder to provide better location services for employee that need to
make 911 calls.
This is a 10-year solution with maintenance and management services built into the
fixed cost for the first 5 years; maintenance will not have to be included in the
operating budget until the 6th year (maintenance costs for year 6 approx. $45-50k).
Operating budget costs will decrease yearly $20-30k beginning second year of the
completion.
About ePlus: ePlus was founded in 1990; they are a public company with over $1
billion in revenue. They are a Cisco Gold reseller, which one of the highest Cisco
designations. ePlus is on several state contracts including ITT50. ePlus has been
working with the Town of Framingham for many years now and understands the
critical needs of the network and mission critical applications that run on it. ePlus
currently helps manage the Town's IT infrastructure giving them even more insight into
its needs. They understand that best pricing, prior experience installing and

ARTICLE 13: Technology Lease
To see if the Town will vote to authorize the Board of Selectmen to enter into a five
year lease for the purpose of technology upgrades and improvements.
Pass any vote or take any action relative thereto.
Draft Motion for Article 13:
move that Town Meeting vote to authorize the Selectmen to enter into a five year
lease for the purpose of procuring Town technology upgrades and improvements.
Sponsor: Chief Financial Officer
Background Material for Article 13
This lease is for a total of $1,250,000 to be paid over 5 years at $250,000 per year. At
the end of the 5 year lease a complete buyout will be purchased for $1.00. The
$250,000 payment for FY17 is factored into the General fund Operating budget
recommendation in both the 1.75% Levy budget and the 1.25% Levy budget. Not only
will this lease save borrowing costs, including costs for bond counsel and insurance,
but there is no interest charged in the lease package. The savings and benefits are
outlined in the Technology Infrastructure Lifecycle Plan below:
Technology Infrastructure Lifecycle Plan
The Town of Framingham Technology Services Division has the opportunity to design
a full scale technology refresh with a long term technology lifecycle plan within a
predictable annual budget. A large portion of the town' network hardware far exceeds
its useful life: core main switch (10 years),firewalls (10 years),switches (7-10 years),
and phones (10 years). No major infrastructure upgrade was done during this time,
only small, directed, upgrades at specific weakness points.

replaced in the next 1-3 years and would have been included for consideration in the
capital budget. Additionally, by bundling the services we will save on installation and
project management fees compared to doing several smaller projects. Cisco also
offers aggressive pricing and incentives in the form of additional equipment when
purchasing in bundles. The potential staff time and effort savings this project provides
will be from a reduction in budgeting work for operating and capital, and less hardware
failures resulting in troubleshooting and downtime.
Technical Benefits: This upgrade allows us to provide a 10GB uplink speed to all of
our locations and to the wiring closets in each building. Currently these links are all
1GB uplinks. The core switch is also capable of 40GB speed to future-proof us for the
lifespan of the equipment. The project includes a phone refresh and will allow us to
increase the speed to the desktop to 1GB from 100MB; the majority of the phones
currently installed are the original phones installed in 2005. Also included is the ability
to provide wireless coverage in all buildings, including guest Internet access. We are
doing a firewall refresh that will add second generation firewalls that are better
equipped to handle spam, spyware and crypto viruses, providing better insight into our
network security to protect our digital foot print. We are also including Cisco's
emergency responder to provide better location services for employee that need to
make 911 calls.
This is a 10-year solution with maintenance and management services built into the
fixed cost for the first 5 years; maintenance will not have to be included in the
operating budget until the 6t" year (maintenance costs for year 6 approx. $45-50k).
Operating budget costs will decrease yearly $20-30k beginning second year of the
completion.

ARTICLE 14: Merger of Water &Sewer Enterprise Funds into a Single Utility

Sponsor: Chief Financial Officer
Draft Motion for Article 14:
move that Town Meeting amend its vote of May 20, 1993, accepting the provisions of
Chapter 44 Section 53F ~/z, establishing separate Enterprise Funds for the "Water
Division" and "Sewer Division", by combining the separate funds into one Utility
Enterprise Fund effective July 1, 2016.
Backaround Material for Article 14
At the 2015 fall Special Town Meeting, members voted to approve the merger of the
Water and Sewer Enterprise Funds into a single Enterprise Fund at the beginning of
FY17.
In 1993, Town Meeting accepted the provisions of MGL Chapter 44 Section 53 F %2
creating two Enterprise funds; one for Water Department operations and one for
Sewer Department operations. Enterprise funds are useful when the function can be
operated like a business, where charges for services are dedicated to the provision of
that service and manages to a bottom line. At the time of this adoption, since we had
separate fees for water and sewer, it was believed that the accounting would be easier
with two separate funds. However, with current accounting systems and improved
consumption measuring the funds can be merged into one with the same accounting
reporting and consumption measurement. The departments would still be separate for
reporting and assigning costs to particular rates for correct rate calculation. Many of
the capital improvement projects and some of the operations staff are currently split
between the two funds and require separate authorizations. If the composition of that
project or staff usage changes we cannot transfer between funds in the current format.
With a merged fund this splitting of projects and fixed allocation of staff is not
necessary. We should be able to save bond costs by having one bond fund for all
water and sewer borrowing proceeds; we could streamline bond counsel review of
projects, preparation costs, documentation costs for prospectus and reporting.

move that town Meeting vote to increase the existing senior property tax exemption
authorized under Chapter 59 Section 5, clause 41 C, from $500 to $1,000, as allowed
by Chapter 59 Section 5, clause 41 C.
Background Material for Article 19:
The state allows certain tax exemptions under Chapter 59 Section 5 of the
Massachusetts General Laws. The Senior exemption, commonly called 41 C exemption,
is a means tested exemption of real property tax. In prior years Town Meeting has voted
to lower the qualifying age from 70 to 65, and the income limits from $13,000/$15,000
to $20,000/$30,000. At this time we recommend an increase of the actual abatement
from $500 to $1,000, which requires a Town Meeting vote to approve. There are
currently 31 seniors who are granted this exemption based on review of qualifying
criteria. The impact of this change would be $16,000. The state provides a pool of
funds to reimburse communities for these clause exemptions, however, it is never
enough to fully reimburse for all exemptions. Any impact of this exemption not
reimbursed by the state would be posted against the tax overlay account included in this
budget.

program.
Page 37
Town of Framingham
2016 i4nnual Town Meeting 
Financial Articles 4- 24
Background
Background Material for Article 20:
Several years ago the Town of Sudbury sent a bill to the state legislature to create a
means tested tax exemption for senior residential taxpayers that was more generous
than the existing state Clause 41C exemption (see article 19). The Sudbury law
allows an exemption of up to 50% of the qualifying tax bill. The primary qualifiers for
the Sudbury tax exemption are: 65 years of age (if co-owned the other party must be
at least 60); lived continually in the residence for at least 10 years; must qualify of the
state circuit breaker credit; value of property cannot exceed the average single family
home plus 10%. The Selectmen in Sudbury determine a total value of exemptions
allowed. The exempted tax does not disappear however, it is absorbed by the
remaining residential tax payers. In FY15, the total exempted was $335,000 across
124 seniors. The average exemption was $2,664 (the average Sudbury tax bill is
more than $10,000) and the impact picked by the average taxpayer was $60.
The Administration is bringing to Town Meeting, as a recommendation, a similar
program. It would have to be created by passing a local law via the state legislature;
hence the authorization to petition the legislature to pass a law. The parameters for
the program would be: 65 years of age (and 60 co-owner); lived continually in
residence for at least 10 years; must qualify for the state circuit breaker credit; value of
the property cannot exceed the average single family home plus 10%. The total
exempted tax amount is $350,000, but the law will allow the Selectmen to increase
that total if the demand is there. The exemption cannot exceed 50% of the tax bill.
The Framingham version of the program would allow the exemption to be absorbed by
all remaining property classes, not just residential. This reduces the impact on the
average remaining residential taxpayer. This is a more conservative version of the
Sudbury program. However, when you review the statistics below you will see that
incomes in Framingham are much lower than Sudbury, home values and tax bills are
lower than Sudbury. The first two data columns use the Sudbury program criteria; it
shows the real difference between the values and demographics befinreen Sudbury
and Framingham. We have much lower income and certainly fewer people who can
afford to absorb the taxes exempted in this program. Framingham's average home
value is also significantly lower than Sudbury even with more than twice the volume.
By proposing a smaller program we are trying to be cognizant of the tax burden of the
remaining taxpayers and the risk that we create a higher tax burden for seniors who
just miss qualifying for this program.

Background Material for Article 23:
Page 40
Town of Framingham
2016 Annual Town Meeting 
Financial Articles 4- 24
Background
Through a net metering agreement, the Town has the ability to purchase energy
payments at a discount. When a solar facility returns electricity to the grid, the solar
facility gets energy credits that it can then sell, generating revenue for their solar project.
The energy credits are sold at a discount; negotiated' as part of the contract. The Town
currently has a shorter term agreement with Framingham Salvage, buying credits at
a15% discount. This is much like buying "Groupons": we buy $100 worth of electricity
credit for $85. We use the credit to pay $100 of our electricity bill and we only spent
$85 to pay $100 of the bill.
However, the state has aself-imposed cap on net metering credits available state-
wide. The state has reached that cap. A large number of solar projects are waiting for
the Net Metering Cap to be raised by state government in order to move forward. The
projects will not proceed unless they know they will be able to sell their power
generation credits. Like many other communities and businesses we cannot move
forward with this agreement until the cap is lifted. If state action is not taken in time for
the annual Town Meeting, we will recommend this article be referred back to sponsor
and prepare to bring it back for the fall Special Town Meeting.

move that Town Meeting vote to appropriate $36,561.74 from the Receipt Reserve
for Appropriation Insurance Proceeds over $20,000 to the Legal Services budget for
the reimbursement of legal costs covered by insurance.
Background Material for Article 24:
In April of 2015, the Town of Framingham and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
were sued in Middlesex Superior Court based on a claim of a wrongful
conviction. The alleged wrongful conviction occurred in March of 1983. Upon receipt
of the complaint, the Town tendered the case to its current public officer's liability
insurer, Traveler's Insurance Company. Travelers denied coverage and declined to
defend the case because the incidents in question occurred in 1982 and 1983, several
years before the Town's current insurance policy came into effect. Upon the denial of

coverage, the Board of Selectmen retained the law firm of Pierce, Davis & Perritano as
special civil rights counsel to defend the Town. Between April-October of 2015, the
Town paid special counsel $36,561.74 for legal fees and expenses from the FY 2016
legal budget. The case remains pending. After the initial denial of coverage, Town
Counsel continued to search Town archives and was able to locate an insurance
policy issued to the Town by St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company effective
July 1, 1982-June 30, 1983. (St. Paul Fire &Marine Insurance Company is an
affiliated company of Travelers.) The Town retendered the case to Travelers in
December 2015 under this 1982 policy and Travelers accepted the retender under the
1982 St. Paul policy and began defending the Town under a reservation of
rights. Travelers subsequently reimbursed the Town $36,561.74 for payments made
to special counsel from the legal budget. This insurance payment of $36,571.74
should be appropriated to the FY 2016 legal budget to replenish the legal budget so
that the legal budget can meet other invoices and obligations in FY 2016. If any funds
remain in the FY 2016 legal budget at the_end of the fiscal years, such excess funds
will be returned to the General Fund.

each year they are requested and budget is reduced to fit within the available funds. However, debt service may be spread
