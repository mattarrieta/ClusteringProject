April 2015
Dear Town Official, Town fVleeting Member, and Taxpayer,
The Fiscal Year 2016 General Fund Operating Budget outlined and presented herein represents the
second year of three (3) year budget plan that represents a turning point for the Framingham
community. During the prolonged period of economic downturn we worked diligently as a team to
identify shared strategies and shared sacrifice to manage the ability of the Town government to deliver
the services residents and businesses require against a very significant decline in both the revenues
available to town government and the ability of our taxpayers to provide them. Throughout that period
Framingham town government made difficult choices from year to year but always with a view towards
what was eventually sustainable over the long haul. That ability to look at our budget on a sustainable,
multi-year basis was further strengthened by our decision to transition our employees and retirees to
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts group health insurance program. That decision exceeded our
expectations in Fiscal Year 2015 and while we are anticipating a premium increase in Fiscal Year 2016 we
are on-track with our projected saving as a result that move — a move which we anticipate will yield $18
million in total savings over the next 3 years.
Driven in part by those anticipated health insurance savings but also recognizing the benefit of
continued certification of healthy general fund balances such as Free Cash, the Fiscal Year 2016 Budget
represents the second year of an effort to take a three (3) year view of our budget and service delivery
obligations. With this opportunity, we should be thoughtful and forward-looking in the way we manage
our budgets. This is particularly important in light of some challenging capital building projects,
including a new, additional school building, coming our way as early as 2017. With this in mind, the
Board of Selectmen, Town Manager and Chief Financial Officer decided to pursue a three year budget
policy and strategy intended to achieve the following goals:
• 7ax Payer Stability and Relief: Based largely on the strength of savings in health insurance as a
result of our move to the MA Group Insurance Commission health insurance program, we
should pursue a goal of limiting the annual increase in the Town's property tax levy to
approximately 1.25% in each of the next three years, FY15, FY16, and FY17, excluding new
growth revenues. This is one half of the maximum 2.5%increase in the levy from year to year
authorized by State law. We were successful in achieving this goal in FY 2015 and plan to
achieve it in FY 2016.
• Stabilizing Shares of the Tax Levy Between Residential Taxpayers and Commercial Industrial
Taxpayers: The Town's taxable property valuation is 78% residential, and 22% is commercial
and industrial. The Town has historically shifted the tax burden from residential taxpayers to
commercial/industrial taxpayers. The Town has traditionally shifted the maximum amount
authorized by state law. This has left the residential taxpayer vulnerable to massive increases in
residential tax bills when residential values climb faster than commercial and industrial or, as

was the case during the recession, if commercial and industrial values drop faster than
residential. The three year goals we have adopted we will strive to maintain the current split in
shares of the actual property tax levy at the current 60 per cent residential and 40 commercial
industrial. In achieving this goal in FY 2015 the Board of Selectmen moved further off the
maximum shift from residential taxpayers to commercial taxpayers creating an important buffer
in the event of either a sudden escalation of residential values or a sudden decrease in
commercial values.
• Fiit the Highest of our High Spending Priorities: The FY 2016 budget largely seeks to maintain
services at current levels following modest investments in Police, Public Health and other
municipal departments in FY 2014 and FY 2015. We seek to maintain those levels of services
through the end of FY 2017. On the other hand we made a substantial investment in the
Framingham Public Schools in Fiscal Year 2015 and will make a similar albeit more modest
investment in FY 2016. The Fiscal Year 2015 increased spending within the FPS by 7% - a
spending level which now carries over from year to year. The FY 2016 budget recommends a 5%
increase over FY 2015 and as a result we will have increased FPS funding by 12% over a two year
period.
• Prepare for IVlajor Capital Projects Beginning in FY 2017: The budget plan seeks to maintain
our current levels of financial reserves but also builds a new Capital Spending Reserve to help
fund a portion of capital building projects that may require voter approval of a significant
property tax increase (through what is known as a Debt Exclusion ballot question). We
anticipate that this Capital Spending Reserve could reach $4.0 million by the end of FY 2017.
Significantly, we believe that the goal of taxpayer stability and relief articulated above will
greatly enhance the likelihood of taxpayer acceptance of these capital building projects,
including a new school facility to accommodate growth in enrollment. We made a $2,284,000
first year down payment into this capital fund in FY 2015 and hope to add another $999,000 as
part of the FY 2016 budget.
As you review the material presented below I hope you will appreciate the deliberateness as well as the
discipline and focus with which we seek to manage the valuable financial resources to which you entrust
us each year. 
Sincerely,
Robert J. Halpin
Town Manager

Backaround Material for Article 6:
State law allows the Town to create certain revolving funds allocating dedicated
revenue streams to fund certain expenditures outside of General fund appropriations.
This is an annual article that aufihorizes the existence of the above revolving funds
with expenditure ceilings for FY16. This article requests an increase in the spending
ceiling for three funds which are the Excavation Management Fund from $75,000 to
$85,000; the Emergency Management Equipment Fund from $5,000 to $15,000; and
the Callahan Senior Center Fund from $30,000 to $40,000. The following explains the
requested increases:
Excavation Management Fund
An adjustment is required for the FY16 ceiling amount to reflect additional income and
projected costs; the current spending cap of $75,000 has been in place sinceFY09. The recommended FY16 spending ceiling is $85,000.00.
Emergency Management Equipment Fund
The Framingham Department of Public Works, as one of three regional cache sites,
maintains an expanding inventory of equipment and supplies which has grown to
approximately fifty (50) pieces. Equipment added this past year include mobile security
Page 8
2015 Annual Town IVleeting  Financial Articles 5-24
cameras, mobile radio sysfem, a 200 Kilowatt mobile generator, a 500,000 BTU
mobile heating unit, a trailer unit fo transport various NERAC equipment along with a
17,000 GVW tow unit. Maintenance costs continue to rise with the increase of the
added equipment. P,n increase in the Emergency Management Equipment Revolving
Fund spending ceiling to $15,000 is requested for FY16. The necessary funds to
maintain this equipment are received through rental fees paid by NERAC member
communities who use the equipment during emergency and weather related events.
Callahan Senior Center F
The Council on Aging plans to add more classes, programs and instructions in FY16,
thereby generating more revenue and is requesting an increase in the expenditure
ceiling for this fund to $40,000.

The list above consists of residual balances in capital project authorizations that are
no longer needed. We have not borrowed against these authorizations so there is no
actual cash to transfer; we simply need to "cancel" the left over authorization. The
reduction of these authorizations actually reduces the amount of General Fund

Transportation-expected to be received in June 2015.
Transfer of $50,000 from the Police and Fire Department budgets to the Veterans
Services Department. This transfer for Veterans Services is due to an increase of a
minimum of a 2.7% COLA on Chapter 115 benefits by the State Department of
Veterans Service.
In addition to the expected COLA increase, Veteran Service is also responsible for all
medical expense incurred. This includes but is not limited to: Medical, Prescription,
Medicare and Medigap insurance premiums, doctor, hospital and ambulance copays
and RX copays. One of the steps we have taken to contain medical expenses, at the
States urging, is to establish our own Town of Framingham BC/BS insurance account
for senior veterans. This plan is very important in keep catastrophic medical expenses
from impacting Chapter 115 budget. Iraq and Afghan veterans are now enrolling in
Chapter 115 services in greater numbers. These veterans require a large amount of
services.

The Capital Budget assembled for FY16 through FY21 is limited in its scope. Each year we have to decide
how much capital investment we can (1) afford and (2) have the management capacity to complete.
This decision is made not just in the short term but uses multiple years worth of data. The capital
budget provides information for five years beyond the proposed budget year. However, many of the
Town Divisions and Departments have capital plans that span 20 years. This information allows us to
see the enormity of what is ahead and to make current year decisions based on a long view impact.
FY16 capital project requests totaled $65.2 million for all funds: General, Water and Sewer. This
budget recommends $46.7 million, as itemized in the table below:

The cost of funding the capital budget has an impact on the operating budget in the form of debt
service. The amount of debt service as a component of the General Fund operating budget is restricted
to 5% by Town policy. This policy complies with financial guidance offered by the state Department of
Revenue. The Enterprise Funds have less narrow rules, however, we want to manage the growth of the
water and sewer rates. By deferring projects to future years the amount of debt service that is included
in the general fund tax levy and the water and sewer rates is less than approving the full capital budget.

The Town has several billion dollars worth of capital assets that it must maintain. To ignore this
responsibility only costs more in dollars and effort once buildings and equipment fail, parks become
unusable, and water and sewer pipes contaminate each other or the environment. This budget
recommends the continued major investment in water and sewer infrastructure, recreation assets, road
improvement and stormwater management. Included is the replacement or acquisition of public safety
equipment and technology, school building repairs and technology, continued investments in multiple
Town owned buildings, upgrades to core technology, financial data systems and necessary public works
and school equipment.

Information gathering begins in October, includes review and evaluation, financial analysis and finally a
recommendation to the Capital Budget Committee 90 days prior to the ,4nnual Town Meeting. The
decision-making process is very dynamic in that it involves significant research on the part of
departments to simply prepare the list of requests. A significant amount of what-if analysis is performed
by Finance and senior management to help make the final decisions. From there the CBC meets with a
number of Division and Department Heads, the CFO and Town IVlanager and additional staff to vet these
projects under their criteria. They advise Town Meeting on a final capital budget. Town Meeting votes
on each individual project (a 2/3 vote is required because we borrow for this budget).
The chart below presents a ten year look at the capital needs of the Town. In most cases this list is
based on a longer term capital plan. At this point we have 20 year plans for Public Works/Water/Sewer,
School Buildings, Town Buildings and Park and Recreation. This chart includes only the core Town
Building plan, not the entire set of Town building needs. The core building plan consists of the fire
stations, the police station, the Main Library and the Callahan Senior Center. This chart does not include
renovations to the Memorial Building or the Danforth Building; the combined cost of repair exceeds $55
million. It does not include what we term the cultural buildings, which are the historic buildings around
Town, and require more than $10 million in repair and renovation cost. The list below includes major
renovations to three schools buildings, the largest of which is slated for FY17 (Fuller/Farley-$48 million).
Water and Sewer investment is significant, but it addresses less than 50% of the network. The chart is
daunting. We have to manage our way through it. The detailed list for each year is included in your
budget book, immediately after this narrative. It is organized by fiscal year, by fund.
Page 23
~ ~ ~ ~  t'
The evaluation of projects includes a set of criteria that includes financial impact, division and
department priority, improvement of or compliance with public safety and health laws and regulations,
legal mandates, need of repair or renovation and service improvement to the public. Projects deferred
are generally the lower priority projects; or we can "squeak out" one more year on a piece of
equipment. A majority of the decision focuses on the ability to make the plan work financially, within
our debt service limits and rate and tax goals. It is critical to review this data over a number of years,
not one year at a time. The projects incur debt service over as short as five years to as long as 25 years.
If, for example, we reviewed the data for FY16 only, without looking at the next five years, we would
have come to the conclusion that we could finance every single requested project. Then in FY17 there
would be no capacity to approve projects because the debt service estimate exceeds 5%. Framingham is
a large Town, with many billions of dollars in roads, bridges, buildings, parks and other recreation
resources, equipment and technology. To neglect these assets is a bad business decision, and ultimately
costs more in the end. Regardless of the need to maintain and improve these assets, we still have to
live within the means of the tax and rate payers of this Town.
~  •:
Debt service is the annual cost to pay back the dollars borrowed to fund these major projects (think
mortgage). As part of the capital budget we not only forecast the total project costs, we forecast the
debt service to measure the current and future impact on the operating budget. The dilemma of debt
service is that while it serves an important role in our ability to fund the necessary investment in our
capital assets, it also consumes operating dollars that might be used to fund policemen, firefighters,
school teachers, building inspectors, financial management and economic development. Which is more
important? We deal with that question every year when we develop the capital and operating budgets.
We also measure and re-measure; analyze and re-analyze that need on a near term basis when we
develop the long range forecast.
One way of making sure, we don'tgo overboard in one direction or another (operating versus capital and
vice versa) is to follow some best-practice business parameters. For the General Fund the state
Department of Revenue recommends a 5% limit on the amount of debt service as part of the total
budget. The chart below shows the comparison to that limit for FY16 through FY21. It assumes the
FY16 recommended debt service only. For FY17 through FY21 is assumes that all requested projects are
approved. This essentially gives us a worst case scenario to work from with regard to future issuance.
But it also shows us the debt service impact of what we have done in the past (the bolded line on the top
third ofthe chartentitled"debtservice on existing generalfund debt). We often review what has been
issued in previous years in order to remove any older, unused debt, by rescinding the remnants of the
authorization. This is done via a separate article at Town Meeting. Watch for one in the 2015 Annual
Town Meeting.

This chart also assumes that the major school building project proposed in FY2017, commonly referred
to as the Fuller/Farley project, will be financed via debt exclusion, and not included within the tax levy
limit. More on that further along in this document.

Water and Sewer debt service does not have a spending ceiling as the rates are intended to increase to
pay for the investment in water and sewer infrastructure. However, we are judicious in our approval of
projects, even though we are suffering from 30 years of ignoring the repair and maintenance needs of
this network. The recommended list for FY16 still only addresses a very small portion of the water and
sewer systems. The debt service charts for the water and sewer enterprise funds are included in your
book after the project lists.
~•  •.
In the next couple of years we will need to invest in a new school building. This will exceed our debt
service capacity within the tax levy; therefore we will need to pass a debt exclusion. A debt exclusion is
essentially a limited override which requires aTown-wide vote to approve. The limitation is that you are
voting for only enough money to pay the debt service on a particular bond authorization, or setoff
authorization. Many communities use a debt exclusion to fund all of their major projects. Reviewing
the debt service chart above, where the Fuller/Farley debt service is excluded, we will still need to make
hard choices and cut capital budgets to fit within out financial capacity is absorb debt service. The chart
below illustrates the impact of debt service if the project is included within the tax levy. We would have
to cut so much of the capital budget to stay within our 5% debt service ceiling that our roads would not
get repaired, other school buildings would not be maintained, parks and recreation buildings and fields
would not be upgraded, expanded or repaired, and Town buildings would continue their decline.

As part of this plan, the Town is also anticipating a grant from the Massachusetts School Building
Authority(MSBA) of 51% of the project cost. The chart below assumes the lower price of $23.5 million
versus $48 million (gross construction estimate). Clearly this project is not affordable without the help
of the MSBA. Without the MSBA funding, the debt service amounts in the chart below in the line "New
(Gross) Debt Service would increase by an average of $2.1 million each year.

', *Assumes all projects requested in FY17 to FY21 are authorized and debt service is calculated. Each year is evaluated as they are authorized and
reduced by vote of Town Meeting to not exceed available budget. Assumes MA School Building Authority funding for FI'17 only.
This Capital Budget is a thoughtfully crafted plan that invests responsibly in Town assets within a
financial framework that fits within the policy goals of the Town for the next several years. The Town
Administration is available to work with the Capital Budget Committee to continue the budget process
for the Annual Town Meeting. Any questions, requests or recommendations are welcomed.
In addition to the new projects recommended in this budget, we are amending an existing project
voted in the May 2011 Annual Town Meeting. The original Butterworth Park Tennis Lighting project
came in well under budget and was awarded CDBG funds to support the lighting improvements. We are
adding language to allow the existing authorization to fund the demolition the existing grandstands and
building ADA accessible bleachers and ADA compliant walkway to and around the new bleachers. The
current grandstands are closed. The concrete structure is a public safety hazard. Any repairs to the
structure will cause the Town to make the current bleachers entirely ADA accessible and code
compliant. It is actually less expensive to demolish the cement grandstand and replace it with aluminum
bleachers on an enlarged cement pad will an accompanying cement walkway. There is $102,969
remaining in the existing capital authorization. This project will cost $73,618. The remaining
authorization after the allocation to this project will be rescinded.

Request Description
Renovation of Loring Arena.
Request Justification
Loring Arena was constructed during the early 1960's, opening to serve the public in 1963. For the past 51 years, the Arena has been an
outstanding asset to the Town. The arena plays a vital role in the community by providing recreational skating opportunities to the
widely varied skating populations in Town. The arena services Town Recreation programs, public skating, public stick time, Framingham
High School Girls and Boys hockey at all levels, a very successful Framingham Youth Hockey program, Northstar Figure Skating Club,
i  Framingham State University, adult hockey, and other local high school organizations. In 2001, an independent wmmittee was formed
'to study the arena's value to the community. The results of the 2001 study confirmed that the arena is part of the Town's identity and
( plays a major role in meeting diverse community skating needs. As a result of the 2001 study, Framingham has continued to make
'appropriate capital investments over the past 12 years to keep the arena's major infrastructure well preserved. A list of recently
'completed capital improvements is included with the backup material for this project. Although recent capital improvements have
'maintained a sound arena infrastructure, they have not addressed: ~ The known issues associated with the 1963 design, including
'gender separation, handicapped accessibility, appropriate quantity and size of lockers rooms, and appropriately configured public use
spaces. •Other identified improvement projects currently carried in the Division's long-range capital plan, including addressing public
health &safety concerns related to the original end wall construction materials, energy efficiency upgrades to original heating/cooling
equipment, and restoration work on the concrete buttresses that support the arched roof beams. In 2013 the Division of Parks,
Recreation, and Cultural Affairs requested funding to conduct a Design Development study for Loring Arena, in order to formalize a plan
and cost associated with addressing these known issues at the facility. As a result of Design Development, the Parks &Recreation
Division is proposing a $5,660,000 renovation as outlined in the supporting documentation. Implementation of the proposed renovations
will appropriately addresses all of these issues, bring the arena into code compliance, and prepare the Town's asset to serve the
community for generations to come.

This project will provide funds for a preliminary design of the repair and replacement of the 88-year old bridge along Salem End Road
over the Stearns Reservoir, in anticipation of eligibility for state funding of the construction under the Transportation Improvement
Program. To be eligible for this state funding, the Town must fund and prepare a preliminary design. Typically, the cost of the
construction is $1,000,000 for every $100,000 spent on design. Replacement includes the approach sidewalks slab and beams at all 4
corners of the bridge. The design will include the analysis of traffic management during construction and analysis of water and sewer
utilities associated with the bridge.
Request Justification
The 2013 Bridge Report identified significant deterioration requiring repairs to the Salem End Road bridge. In addition, the bridge is part
of a major traffic route in Town, especially during commuting hours. Significant planning is required to manage the traffic during
construction. The full design therefore needs to be completed in the next two to three years not only before the bridge conditions
become a hazard but also so that the necessary traffic mitigation can be implemented prior to construction.

Description
This project will provide funds for the design and construction of the restoration of a section of Hop Brook west of the Hemenway Road
and the CSX rail line. The project was originally identified through the Phase 3 Stormwater Master Plan and will include the removal of
the Landham Pond Dam and related improvements in Hop Brook to support the removal of the dam. The proposed improvements
include the removal of the dam, removal/adjustments to existing sediments and fill materials, and habitat restoration. The project is
largely located within Town-owned areas, but access easements) may be required. Design activities will include survey and hydraulic
modeling to assure that the improvements provide benefits.
Request ]ustification
The Landham Pond Dam is the only Town-owned dam, built as a private dam more than 70 years ago and donated as part of a land
grant to the Town in 1973. It was identified through the Phase III Stormwater Master Plan, is believed to contribute to upstream
hydraulic issues on the Hop Brook. Hydraulic modeling from the Stormwater Master Plan shows that removal of the dam will reduce the
frequency and severity of flooding in upstream areas such as Hemenway Road, Sloane Drive, and Gregory Road. Restoration of the
original stream will improve the habitat for native aquatic species. The design will be used to seek funding for grants for construction,
which if successful, will reduce the construction costs.

(Request Description
This Capital Program request will provide funds for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Town's arterial and secondary road
segments for athree-year period. DPW- is responsible for the maintenance of the Town of Framingham's roadway network and
management of the Roadway Capital Improvement Program. The Department is requesting athree-year Roadway Improvement
,allocation to promote better planning, control, and accountability, as well as to eliminate constraints created by the short New England
'construction season and annual fiscal year restrictions. The Department will be able to exercise more control over both Departmental
'.resources as well as contracted services. Athree-year plan will promote coordination of resources and planning.
Request Justification
The roadway network is a critical piece of the Town's infrastructure, requiring considerable maintenance, which is identified and
prioritized according to the Town's Pavement Condition Index (PCI) as stated in the Pavement Management Study. Roadways are
identified based on traffic volume, repair costs, repair life expectancy, and road condition, and are selected based on their benefit to the
Town. The allocation of funding on a multi-year basis will allow the Department to implement more effective and efficient scheduling of
roadwork, by coordinating projects within the Department and within the Town, and by impacting residents with only a single season of
construction in a given area. The three-year funding plan would also extend the construction season, creating less traffic and impacts on
residents, schools, and businesses, as well as more effectively utilizing the reduced traffic volume during school summer vacation, while
still achieving the Departments goals and objectives for road rehabilitation.

Farley School —Pool Area Roof, Exterior Siding, Copper Roof Replacement
Request Justification
FY16: The pool area of the Farley School roof was not included in the roof replacement project performed by the current tenant,
MassBay Community College. This portion of the Farley School roof is in very poor condition and must be replaced. Water has
deteriorated the structure and a contract is currently being processed to obtain design and construction estimates. The exterior siding
and copper roofs also require replacement. These were replaced at the Barbieri School in 2011 and the schools are almost identical in
,design. The $1,207,388.00 requested is a best estimate at this time and a final figure will be available by December from Russo Barr
Associates who has been contracted to research the building envelope conditions and provide construction estimates. The Farley School
'is currently leased by MassBay Community College and the School Department plans to return this school to FPS use when the lease
term negotiated has expired. This work is necessary in order to keep the building in the School District's inventory.

Request Description
Furnish new and replace outdated furniture in multiple schools.
Justification
FY16: In order to address District population growth at the elementary level, the King School has been reopened as an elementary
school in FYlS, and new furniture is required. Current population growth is prompting changes in the District with the King School being
converted to a ninth elementary school. Kindergarten students were placed at the King School in FY15 with an additional grade level
added each subsequent year until it reaches capacity as a K-5 school in 5 years. In addition, the majority of the District's schools have
the same furniture that was purchased during their construction in the sixties. Although there are many pieces of new furniture in the
schools, there are 200 plus classrooms that still use outdated furniture. Current teaching methods and modern technology in the
elementary and middle school grades requires the use of laptops and other devices. Modern furniture will better accommodate the use
of these devices, instructional techniques and curriculum delivery. $ 300,000 FY17-FY25: Continuation of furniture upgrades $ 300,000

This project will replace all of our current standalone VMware hosts (6) with a solution that will provide added, needed space and ensure
we are prepared for future growth. Our network is currently 54% virtualized, with more hardware coming off warranty every year. As
new applications are researched and purchased, virtualization is not only cost effective but reliable.
Request Justification
UCS is a Unified Computing System. The project includes installation of one 8 slot chassis at both Town Hall and our DR (disaster
recovery) location. Each chassis will have 4 blade servers installed in each for a total of 4 hosts at each site, which will double our
current capacity and provide room for future growth. The current hardware is going or has gone end of life and/or end of support. This'',
UCS system is used for our virtual environment, inluding VOIP, Munis Integrated Financial System, Laserfiche, the Town's website, e-',
mail, Accela Enterprise Permitting system, print servers, SharePoint, SQL Server. As the majority of vendors now support virtual
environments, new applications can be purchased and installed without the need for additional servers and licenses.

Request Description
The Callahan Senior Center roof is comprised of 10,603 square feet of flat roof and 7,161 square feet of shingled roofs. The roof holds.
multiple pieces of HVAC equipment which are set on roof curbs. The need to address the roofing transition of the HVAC curbs will enable'
is water tight seal on these connection seams. This project will identify the proper air circulation under the shingled section of the roof'
and will provide the roof system with air movement to breathe in order to attain its full life span.
uest Justification
The shingled roof sections are in critical need of replacement and should be an immediate priority. The roof has multiple areas of
leakage throughout both roof systems. The single ply membrane roofing system has numerous patches and the HVAC units curbing
have been the cause of some of the previous leaks in past. The repair efforts are visible across the roof surface and around the HVAC
units. The shingled section areas of the roof are in extremely poor condition and appear that the large portion of the plywood deck may
be in substandard condition. The roof replacement will need to incorporate proper ventilation to extend the shingle service life and the

The Lexington Street Public Library is in need of a fire alarm replacement. The existing fire alarm systems technology is outdated and
needs to be replaced with a new addressable system. This project will consist of a full panel replacement along with all devices within
the building including heat detectors, duct smokes for all 53 VAV boxes and replacement of an additional system to protect the IT server
room. The fire alarms are a main component of the life safety systems of the building.
Justification
The fire alarm panel at the Public Library dates back to the original construction date of 1978. The traditional life span of a fire alarm
panel is 25 years. The existing fire alarm panel has currently been in trouble mode due to the age of the panel and the components of
the fire alarm system. The main fire alarm panel's components cannot be repaired or replaced due to the unit being discontinued over a
decade ago. If the unit were to fail prior to the replacement of the fire alarm the building cannot be occupied without a fire watch. The
existing Halon system which protects the buildings IT server room needs to be removed since the system is comprised of an inert gas
system and the ability to achieve the right balances of gases are critical to make any form of discharge from this unit nontoxic. This
current system has been banned by the Environmental Protection Agency since 1994.

Request Description
The Police Department is in need of replacement of the buildings 22 year old boiler system due to an increase in the amount of repairs
and inefficiency of the existing boiler units. The ability to replace the existing boiler units with newer boiler models and multi speed
pumps would provide the Town of Framingham with a rate of return on annual operating costs. The significance of the replacement
boiler units are to ensure that the current units do not fail in our Public Safety Building.
'Request Justification
The boiler units at the Police Department Headquarters are approaching the end of their life cycle. These units have been in structure for
the past 22 years and operate twenty-four hours a day, 7 days a week. The ability of the new replacement boilers efficiency level is
92% compared to the existing boiler units which are rated at 70%.The estimated anticipated cost savings on gas consumption with the
replacement of the new units will result in an approximate annual savings of $8,100.00 for the running of one boiler. In addition to the
potential gas savings, the complete replacement project is to include the installation of water circulation pumps which will reduce the
electrical consumption while conserving electricity when the boiler is functioning on low fire mode. These circulation pumps on average
consume 57% less horsepower and run 291 fewer revolutions per minute which translate into a decrease of 419,000 cycles less per day.
The multi advantages achieved with the replacement of the water circulation pumps are that the units last longer, require less
maintenance, and use less energy. The combination of these new mechanical units will provide dual savings for both gas and electrical
consumption use.

Request Description
The site selection for Fire Station# 2 will develop a program to meet their current and anticipated future needs along with perfiorming a site feasibility
assessment for the new facility. Using this approach will provide the Town of Framingham with a probable cost and site options. This feasibility study
will also evaluate the proximity of instances relative to the potential sites and an outline of the advantages and disadvantages of each potential future
site. The main goal for this study is to provide the Town of Framingham with the specific details to make informed decisions about the viable options
for relocation and construction.
Justification
The existing building that is now Fire Station #2 was constructed in 1901 to support the Roxbury carpet mill buildings. The current lot that the Fire
Station is on is shared with the Athenaeum Hali. The small lot restriction prevents and limits any expansion of the station. The existing foot print of
the building has enforced restrictions on the use of the limited bay sizes, which cannot house a ladder truck and the ongoing challenges of the
building being over 100 years old pose additional challenges for the buildings future improvements. The current masonry has several deteriorated
areas from previous years of water infiltration and the motor joints on the brick are in need of full replacement. The hose tower and two chimneys
have severe decay of the brick work in many places and will require reconstruction of many portions of the masonry. The main Floor of the truck bay
is a cast-in-place concrete slab which has suffered significant water intrusion and reinforcing steel corrosion. This has been addressed with a
temporary shoring of the slab. The interior structure of the building has an array of challenges due to the age of the structure. The building lacks a
fire suppression system and proper fire alarm system. Adequate toilet, shower, locker and separate dormitory facilities are not available for female
firefighters. The building is generally not compliant with the requirements of the American Disabilities Act or the Massachusetts Architectural Access
Board. There is no second means of egress from the second floor of the building, which houses firefighters living space. A combination of all these
issues presents the Town of Framingham with financial challenges and a required investment to the existing structure that will yield the result of
limited functionality. A new site and facility is the most prudent option and investment for the Town of Framingham's precincts that Fire Station #2
services.

Request Description
This request is for funds for the design and construction of replacement of existing wastewater mains and appurtenances in various
locations. The work includes the rehabilitation or replacement of wastewater mains, manholes, structures and related equipment.
Request Justification
During the course of the year the Department encounters situations where small sections of wastewater mains are found to be in need
of replacement through traditional construction methods or rehabilitated with a structural liner. This project would allow the Department
to survey, design and construct the work utilizing in-house staff whenever possible or to contract out where immediate attention is
required. Particular attention will be placed on locations where the risk of failure is high and could result in health and safety issues
including sewer system overflows or back-ups into customer's buildings.

'iThis appropriation will provide for the replacement and upgrades of equipment at four older wastewater pumping stations. The project
includes the replacement of pumps, motors and controls and other improvements as needed at several sewer pumping stations
'i  including Woodland, Blackberry, Lomas, Lowther and Garvey (located at or near the roads with the same name).
'Request Justification
The lifespan of these stations can be extended a decade or more through the replacement of component parts as they become worn and
,inefficient, thereby reducing the near-term need for significant capital funds. For example, the underground controls and Supervisory
'Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems at Blackberry, Lomas, and Lowther should be raised above ground for safety purposes.

This project will provide funds necessary to design and construct sewer system improvements on Evergreen, Learned, Myrtle, Sanger
and William Welch Streets. This project is coordinated with the Evergreen Area Water Main Upgrades. This project is part of the capital
improvement program focused on the coordinated upgrade of the Town's public utility systems and is being coordinated with water
(system improvements and area roadway upgrades. The project includes the replacement of approximately 500 linear feet of sewer that
'was identified as structurally deficient through the Town's comprehensive Sewer System Evaluation Survey program. Additionally 1,500
linear feet of sewer will be rehabilitated through trenchless methods to extend the life of this asset. The project includes the restoration
of the roadways upon project completion.
Request Justification
The sewer system related to these improvements suffers from a variety of problems related to infiltration and inflow, condition, and age.
Portions of the system have been identified as structurally deficient and other sections allow excessive inflow and infiltration into the
sewer system. The replacement of the gravity sewer system is required to prevent significant cost and damage associated with
structural failure, to meet the needs of the MetroWest Hospital and surrounding properties.

I  Request Description
,This project will provide funds for the design of the replacement of the Shawmut Terrace Sewer and John McQuinn Pump Stations. The
'projects include removal of the existing pump station, installation of a new pump station, replacement of associated gravity sewers and
force mains that are in deteriorated condition, and upgrades to the electrical and SCADA systems. The Woodland force main design
includes the realignment of the Woodland sewer force main from private properties, where it is deteriorated and difficult to maintain. An
extended design period is also anticipated due to coordination with MassDOT. The stormwater system will be assessed for improvements if
it is impacted by the construction. No upgrades to the water system are anticipated. Limited easement work is anticipated as part of the
reconstruction and minor roadway reconstruction will be required to restore surfaces.
Request Justification
The Shawmut Terrace pump station is 54 years old in severely deteriorated condition and is located in the public beach house, making the
equipment difficult to access and maintain. It will be relocated from its current location into the public right-of-way. The force main will be
resized to fit the requirements of the neighborhood. The existing stormwater and wastewater collection systems are in poor condition and
require replacement/rehabilitation. The John McQuinn station is 33 years old and the DPW is no longer able to readily obtain spare parts.
The station also does not meet current DEP and DPW standards and is very difficult to maintain. The Woodland force main almost 60 years
old, and is located in areas of high vulnerability. A failure could result in significant damage to other properties and the Mass Turnpike. The
DPW recently needed to repair a section of the force main located adjacent to the pumping station. The force main serves approximately
1000 customers and would be extremely costly to repair in its entirety.

'This project will provides design funds for the upgrade and realignment of the sewer system on Worcester Road from Caldor Road to the
Natick town line. The existing sewer system is located adjacent to Worcester Road and in easements within Natick. The project will
evaluate options to eliminate segments of 9,000 linear feet of pipe within Natick, which are difficult to access and are located within wet
land areas. The design also includes the lining of 800 feet of 80-year old asbestos cement sewer pipe from Burr Street Extension along
Cochituate Road and 500 feet of 80-year odd cross country vitreous clay pipe from Cochituate Road to Speen Street. Easements work
will be required as well as coordination with MassDOT, Natick and the Conservation Commission. The design will also include an
evaluation of technologies that may be appropriate for this section of the sewer system, including pump stations and force mains.
Request Justification
The existing Town sewer systems contain significant deficiencies and are frequently subject to surcharging and overflows. The pipe
system is approximately 67 years and constructed of vitreous clay pipe, which is prone to high levels of infiltration and inflow.
Additionally the project will improve DPW access to the system for maintenance, some of which is currently located within wet land
areas and in Natick.

'Request Description
This project will provide funds for the design of a new double barrel siphon to replace the existing single barrel facility. The siphon is
located near the intersection of Waveney Road and Lanewood Avenue and flows underneath an MWRA aqueduct. Approximately 300-
feet of gravity sewer and 4 manholes will be placed and a 150' dual barrel siphon will be installed as part of the project. The existing
pipe system is asbestos cement and will require special handling during construction; temporary wastewater pumping may be required.
The road surface will be restored to conform to the recent roadway improvements in the area.
Request Justification
The existing siphon is poorly configured and does not allow proper access to the wastewater division for the maintenance and inspection
of the pipeline. The siphon also is configured with a single barrel, which does not provide for the redundant pipeline that is standard for
this type of infrastructure. The upgrade will replace the existing facility and provide a redundant dual barrel siphon as well as the
necessary access and isolation facilities to allow for proper operation and maintenance.

This project provides funds for the final design and construction project to formally abandon the Speen Street sewer pump station force
mains. The existing pipe lines are three miles in length and composed of various materials including 12-inch to 24-inch cast iron, ductile
iroh, and asbestos pipe. They are located under rights-of-way and within easements in both Framingham and Natick. The routine
abandonment process will include accessing the pipe at regular locations along the pipe and filling with a material that will prevent the
pipe from collapsing due to corrosion.
Request Justification
The existing force mains are no longer required as other improvements in the sewer system have been constructed to replace them. The
existing pipes are large diameter and a failure in the pipe would like result a collapse in the road or private property surface (sinkhole),
which could result in property damage or injury.

Request Description
As in 2014, this requested funding will be used to replace approximately 50 hydrants and 25 gate valves utilizing in-house staff and
contracted services as needed. The appropriation includes the purchase of hydrants, gate valves, and appurtenances as well as roadway
and sidewalk restoration. Additionally the Department will be continuing its gate-valve exercising program.
Request Justification
One of the most critical services that the Water Division provides is ensuring adequate water volume and pressure for firefighting
purposes and hydrants in good working order. In accordance with the master plan's recommendations, the Water Division replaces a
minimum of 50 hydrants and associated gate valves per year. In addition to replacing these hydrants and valves, it is critical that we
exercise the over 5,000 gate valves that control the flow of water throughout the distribution system. These exercises provide invaluable
data to both operations as well as the capital design group.

!,This project will provide funds necessary to design and construct water main replacements and upgrades on Evergreen, Learned, Myrtle,
Sanger and William Weich Streets. This project is coordinated with the Evergreen Area Sewer Improvements. This project is part of the
capital improvement program focused on the coordinated upgrade of the Town's public utility systems and is being coordinated with
sewer system improvements and area roadway upgrades. The project includes the replacement of approximately 2,200 linear feet of 2-
inch and 6-inch cast iron pipe with new 8-inch ductile iron new water main and the interconnection of the water main system on William
Welch and Sanger Street. All hydrants, gate valves and water services within the right of way will also be replaced. The project includes
the restoration of the roadways upon project completion. Disturbed roadway surFaces will be restored following the construction of the
water mains.
Request Justification
The water mains in this area are between 100 and 125 years old, and no longer meets the Town's standards for minimum pipe size.
They will be replaced with pipe that is up to standards as well as meeting the needs of the MetroWest Hospital and surrounding
properties. The system lacks appropriate interconnections making users vulnerable to extended water disruptions associated with the
repair of the system. The replacement will also reduce the vulnerability of the system from emergency repairs due to the age and
condition of the water mains. This project is coordinated with the Evergreen Area Sewer Improvements.

This project will provide funds for the replacement of approximately 3,900 linear feet of 12-inch cast iron and asbestos cement water
main pipe located on Speen Street and the eastern portion of Cochituate Road, with limited improvements to the water and sewer
system at the intersection of Cochituate Road and Speen Street. The existing system will be replaced and upgraded to provide proper
size and new valves, hydrants and services within the Town right-of way. The inactive sewer force main in the same section of Speen
Street will be property abandoned. The road restoration will include only trench repair, as this roadway is planned to be paved under the
Highway Department's Annual Paving Program.
Request Justification
The existing 55-year old water main has a high incidence of breaks due to the materials and construction methods used during
installation. When the pipe breaks, it destroys the roadway, requiring full restoration. In addition, this project will remove a section of
asbestos cement pipe which is consistent with the goals of the Water Master Plan. A failure of the system impacts significant commercial
businesses in the Town. The force main abandonment is included in this project to take advantage of the water main replacement
construction along the same section of Speen Street at the same time.

This project will provide funds for an alternatives analysis and design to determine the most cost effective and operationally beneficial
approach to upgrading the Town's existing steel water storage tank located on Indian Head Heights. The existing steel water storage tank
has a capacity of 3.5 million gallons. The Water Main is 16" asbestos cement pipe. The access road will be improved (drainage/pavement)
.with the project. Because of the age of the existing tank, coating deficiencies and need for upgrades to meet modern water storage tank
'design standards, a detailed study is required to determine the most cost effective alternative for either upgrading or replacing the existing
!tank. The study will consider the relative advantages of replacing the existing tank compared with the installation of two smaller tanks. The
'design will also include creating a location for a future communications tower, as well as a needed low retaining wall along the roadway.
Justification
'The existing Indian Head water tank was constructed 75 years ago, and the interior and exterior coating systems are in need of
',replacement. Safety systems, controls and other ancillafy systems also require updating to bring up to modern standards. An evaluation of
alternatives is required to determine the most cost effective and operationally beneficial approach to upgrading the storage at this site.
'The tank is a critical component to the Town's water system and serves a majority of the Town's homes and businesses, serving about
'50,000 people. Without aboveground reservoirs such as this tank, the water system would cease to function due to of lack of pressure. The
'long-term advantage of a second tank is to provide sufficient pressure when the first tank needs to be taken off-line for cleaning or repair

Request Description
This project at Butterworth Park will remove the existing 1930's concrete grandstands and replace them with an appropriately sized,
fully handicapped accessible, all-weather aluminum bleacher seating system. The project also includes installation of a handicapped
accessible internal walking path, and the removal of existing pulverized asphalt and restoration of the area to green space.
Request Justification
The current Butterworth Grandstands were built in approximately 1935 as a WPA project. Beginning in the late 1980's they began to
exhibit deterioration and by the early 1990's had fallen into considerable disrepair. In approximately 1994-95 it was debated whether or
not the grandstands should be torn down and replaced with a smaller structure more suited to the current demands. At that time a
decision was made to repair the aging concrete structure at a cost in excess of $120,000. Since 1995, the repairs have failed and the
structure has continued to deteriorate under another 20 years of New England weather conditions. Current condition of the structure
presents a significant public safety hazard. Based on those conditions, the Director of Parks and Recreation, with the concurrence of the
Building Commissioner, closed the grandstands to public access in October, pending the results of a certified engineering assessment.
The full structural analysis report is included with project background material. The report highlights include: •The level of damage to
the existing structure is classified as substantial. •Several potential and actual structural and safety hazards exist in and around the
grandstand structure. •The structure is not compliant with current building and accessibility codes. •The value of the structure
compared to the estimated cost of repairs will trigger requirements to bring the entire grandstand structure into compliance with all
current codes. e The possibility of demolishing the grandstand should be considered as a reasonable and practical alternative to the
labor-intensive concrete and architectural upgrades required. 0 Cost to repair only the concrete is estimated at between $136,000 and
$176,000. This figure may be significantly higher due to the potential for unknown/unforeseen degradation encountered once work
begins. •The above estimate does not include the cost of accessibility and code requirement upgrades which will be required. In
addition to the public safety issues stated above, the decaying grandstands are continually stained with mold and defaced with graffiti.
The resulting conditions are a serious detraction from the overall aesthetics of the park proper and neighborhood in general. These
conditions also require a significant investment of time and resources to mitigate, which may only last days before new graffiti appears.
In 2011 the Annual Town Meeting authorized $146,500 for the installation of a new electrical service and night lighting at the four (4)
Butterworth Tennis Courts. Through a combination of CDBG Grant funding, in-kind electrical services performed by Keefe Technical
School, and internal Parks staffing resources, the Parks Department was able to complete the entire project at total cost to the Town of
$43,531. We are seeking a reauthorization of the remaining $102,969 balance from the Butterworth Tennis Lighting to accomplish the
grandstand replacement and park improvements.

Executive Summary
The FY2016 Operating Budget continues the three-year plan developed at the beginning of FY2015. The
goals continue to be to keep the levy at 1.25%, moderate tax bills, manage the tax burden at a 60/40% split
between residential and commercial tax sectors, hit our most important spending priorities and to make
the plan sustainable.
One of the end results of the three year plan is to create an environment for atown-wide vote for a debt
exclusion (a limit time period override) for a major school building project as early as FY2017. This plan
assumes that the state's School Building ,4uthority(MSBA) will provide 51% of the funding for that project.
It is clear from the long term budget forecasts that there is not enough capacity within the tax levy to fund
a large school project. Hence the short term plan to create immediate relief for taxpayers by not raising the
tax levy to its maximum amount, using alternative revenue sources and limiting growth in expenditures.
The budget package is balanced at $253,514,694. This includes a separate, special purpose article which
moves the economic development seed money for EDIC from the annual Community and Economic
Development appropriation to a multi-year special purpose account. Total budget growth is 3.1% or $7.7
million (including the special purpose account). Most departmental budgets are funded at level service —
no added services, just the increased cost of doing business. A straight level service budget would have
increase $6, 031,813 or 2.5%. There is an additional $1,579,870 for an increase in services for FY16. The
majority, $1.1 million is for school improvement, a commitment that was made when the three year budget
model was built. The remaining $479,870 is spread across a number of municipal departments and
includes 6.9 added positions and enhanced programming. In total, the School Department appropriation is
increasing by 5% over FY15 and Municipal Departments are increasing by 3.1% over FY15. Investments in
the Stabilization Fund, the Capital Stabilization Fund and the OPEB Trust continue in this budget. Health
Insurance, the increase of which is controlled by the GIC, has a growth rate of 1.3% over the FY15
appropriation, but may require additional resources. Debt Service, based on the recommended FY16-20
Capital Budget, is decreasing slightly from FY15. Detailed descriptions and dollar amounts are included in
the FY2016 Global Summary document included in the package.
Revenue growth is 2.95% or $7,259,287 for a total of $253,537,287. In addition to the 1.25% tax levy
increase, new development tax growth is $1,036,430. The entire State Aid revenue category is increasing
4.8% or $2.2 million. This estimate has some risk in that the state budget crisis may affect FY16 state aid.
Local revenues are growing by 3.1%,or slightly over $620,000. Enterprise Indirect charges increase by 3.3%
or $94,000. $4.9 million of Free Cash is used to fund the reduced tax levy, the Stabilization Fund, the
Capital Stabilization Fund and the OPEB Trust.
The tax increase for the average homeowner is estimated at $90 to $95; achieving the tax bill goal set in
FY15. A tax burden reserve of $700,000 is included in this budget to keep the tax shares at 60% residential
and 40% commercial should the final state certified values shift that burden toward residential taxpayers.
This method worked well in FY15 and had major effect on keeping the average homeowner tax increase to
$30. 
{~~:_~

Page 109
Year Two of the Three Year Plan
FY16 is the second year of the three year budget plan that was introduced to Town Committees and Town
Meeting. The plan is still achieved. Where last year there was a significant reduction in health insurance
costs to reduce the expenditure growth that would have necessitated the full increase in the levy, this year
Free Cash fills the gap. The tax bill increase assumes much more moderate changes in property values,
since FY15 was a revaluation year and FY16 is not. Property analysis will still be conducted but on a more
limited scale which leads to more modest interim year changes in value. Therefore the tax burden reserve
is much less than FY15 ($700,000 versus $1.6 million).
Both the FY16 Capital Budget and this operating budget were crafted to minimize impact on FY17, the third
year of the budget plan. The FY16 budget plans also live within the means of the lower levy and moderate
use of free cash over the short term. Continued investment in reserves and service improvement, at a pace
that is sustainable, is also a part of the plan.
After the third year of the budget plan, the tax levy will increase to the maximum amount.
FY16 Revenue Estimate
The FY16 revenue estimate is $253,537,172, growth of $2.95% or $7,259,287. Of this amount $172 million
is property taxes. As this pie chart below illustrates, property taxes are the overwhelming majority of
revenue at 69%. In FY14 taxes were 71% of total revenue and in FY11 taxes were 77% of total revenue. So
progress has been made to reduce pressure on the tax levy and find alternative revenue sources.
State aid total $49 million, growth of $2.5 million or 4.8%. The largest portion of state aid is Chapter 70 aid,
at $39 million. This revenue estimate assumes Chapter 70 aid will increase by 7%. In FY16 the growth was
6%,although that amount was specifically restricted as part of a political statement regarding lack of
support for retiree health insurance reform by municipalities. The Governor's budget recommendation is
higher for Ch. 70 aid but lower in charter School reimbursements and a number of other components of
state aid. At this point in time the net state aid is $650,000 higher than is built into this budget. However,
we have no reference point for what the state Legislature will pass given the state budget deficit; so the
recommendation is to hold tight until the fall Town Meeting.
Local receipts are those revenues raised by local fees, fines, rents and certain taxes. FY16 local receipts are
$19.8 million, an increase of 3.1%. The increase is driven mostly by excise tax and building permit fees.
This revenue source represents 8% of total revenue and has been consistently 8% of total revenue for a
number of years.
Enterprise Indirect revenue is the overhead charge for administrative services and centralized costs
provided to the Water and Sewer Departments. The amount for FY16 is $3.9 million, growth of 3.3% or less
than $100,000.

Property Taxes and the Tax Levy
There are policy goals related to FY16 taxes: keep the levy at 1.25%,keep the average single family tax bill
below $100 and maintain the levy shares at 60% residential and 40% commercial. This budget sets the tax
levy growth at 1.25%,supported by limited growth in the budget and the use of free cash of $2.1 million.
The average single family tax bill is estimated to increase $90 to $95. That increase assumes that
residential property values rise by .5%and commercial properties rise by 1.3%. FY16 is an interim valuation
year which means that the statistical analysis and information gathering is less than a revaluation year.
Values may change but they do not change at the scope of a revaluation year like FY15. Should values
change in proportions different than the estimate, a tax burden reserve of $700,000 is included in this
budget. The purpose of the reserve is to keep the average homeowner tax bill below $100 and the tax
burden at 60/40%.
If we raise the levy in FY16 to the full 2.5%tax payers would be pay $2.16 million more in taxes.
fVew tax growth —the increase in tax revenue from new development — is estimated at $1,063,430. There
are several large development/redevelopment projects ongoing, including expansion at Genzyme in
Technology Park and redevelopment of the old Breyers Plant off of Speen St. The residential development
at Danforth Green will add more than 300 housing units over time.
Prudent use of Free Cash
$4.9 million of free cash is used in this budget. At the end of FY14, free cash was certified at $11.7 million.
$3 million is used the offset the levy increase. $999,000 is allocated for the Capital Stabilization Fund.
$168,000 is allocated to the Stabilization Fund and $749,000 is directed to the OPEB Trust.
Free cash will also be allocated to offset the levy increase in FY17 and will continue to fund the Capital
Stabilization Fund, maintain the Stabilization Fund at 5% of budget, and fund a contribution to the OPEB
Trust. At the end of the three year budget plan, free cash will be used to fund only the reserves-OPEB,

Stabilization Fund and Capital Stabilization Fund. Enough flexibility will have been created within the levy
capacity and the shift factor to make corrections to tax burden shifts.
FY16 Spending Recommendations
• ,.
The total budget increase is 3.1% which is $7.7 million. This includes reallocating $120,000 of EDIC
economic development money from the General Fund annual operating budget to a special purpose article.
The base budget, or level service budget, increases $6.06 million or 2.3%. Of that increase $4.3 million is
the School Department. The remaining $1.7 million funds level service increases for the rest of the budget,
including centralized costs.
On top of the base budget is service improvement funding of $1.6 million. $1.1 million is allocated to the
School Department for performance improvements in the School District. The remaining $479,870 is
distributed across municipal departments as described in the paragraphs below.

Framingham Schools
Framingham Public Schools recommendation for FY16 is $114, 931,953. This is a base budget (level service)
increase of 4% or $4,378,152 over the FY15 voted budget. This 4% is not an arbitrary number; it is the
combination of different rates of increase for certain budget components of the School District: 4% for
salaries, 6%for operating (which includes an 8%increase for the subset of Special Education out of district
tuition),3%for energy and 2% for maintenance. On top of that $1.1 million is added for district
improvements, bringing the total budget increase to $5,478,152 or 5%. This funding provides phase 2of an
improvement plan which capitalizes on a 72% ($7.3 million) increase in the FY15 budget. Combined with
the $1.4 million in improvement money from FY15, this represents a $2.5 million improvement plan for two
years.

fVlunicipal Department Spending
There are 36 municipal departments ranging from Accounting to Council on Aging to Technology Services to
Public Health to Highways and everything in between. Total municipal level service spending for FY16 is
recommended at $58,638,033, an increase of $1.27 million or 2.2%. Total municipal salary spending,
which includes base wages, all overtime and stipends is $44.46 million which is 2.7% higher than FY15.
Operating budgets total $12.3 million which is 3.4%higher than FY15. Energy spending is budgeted at
$1.87 million, an increase of 3%. Small capital funding, essentially projects and pieces of equipment that do
not fit the definition of capital for bonding, totals $517,024.
Municipal Departments are adding 6.9 positions in FY16. 4.9 FTEs are completely new and 2 FTEs are
existing, but unfunded positions that have been "frozen" since the FY09 layoffs. These positions are a
centrally focused ADA Compliance Officer in Building Inspections, 2 Lead Drivers in Sanitation for in-house
recycling pick-up, a Mechanical Tradesperson in Facilities Management, a Fiscal Coordinator in Human
Resources, apart-time Administrative Assistant in the Planning Board, apart-time Clinician for the Jail
Diversion program, and aProgrammer/Analyst in Technology Services. These added positions are intended
to improve the level of service to taxpayers, both internal and external customers, and improve the level of
maintenance of Town buildings.
Centralized Costs
Health Insurance
The FY16 appropriation for health insurance is $29,751,864. This is an increase of 1.3% or $387,608 over
FY15. Overall FY16 rates are increasing 5.7%, however, FY15 costs are coming in lower than budgeted, so
we are holding at the $29.7 million number. Health insurance will maintain its share of the budget at
11.7%.
Property/Liability Insurance
Current estimates for property and liability insurance indicate a 10% increase, but claims are turning
favorable this year and may merit a slightly lower increase. The next quarter's claims will be the
determinant factor. So we are recommending the higher amount and will amend lower in the fall town
meeting if needed.
Snow and Ice Removal
The recommended budget for FY16 increases overtime by 3% with an offsetting reduction in small capital
equipment replacement, netting almost level funding. FY15 spending has surpassed the $2 million mark
with two blizzards in a two week period and over 76 inches of snow over three weeks. We could see
spending of $2.5 - $2.6 million. All FY15 deficit will be closed in FY15, none will be carried over to FY16.
Debt Service
Debt Service is the repayment costs related to borrowing funds for capital projects —repayment of a loan.
The amount for FY16 is a function of what is recommended in the FY16 Capital Budget plus what we have
to pay for debt we have already issued. One of the initiatives we have embarked on in the Finance
{;=  ~~
Page 113
Department includes reviewing the timing of how much we need to borrow and when. By fine tuning that
requirement the annual amount of debt service better matches the actual cash need. Therefore, the total
for debt service in FY16 is $11,604,530, which is a decrease of $170,139. Included in the debt service
division of accounts is interest on property tax abatements of $315,000.
Pensions
The Framingham Retirement System annual appropriation is a function of the long term funding schedule
that is updated every two years. The current funding schedule will fully fund the pension liability by 2030.
The Retirement System has three members: the Town of Framingham, the Framingham housing Authority
and the Metrowest Regional Transit Authority. The Town is the largest member ad pays 96% of the total
annual required contribution. For FY16, that is $12.3 million.
RCS2fV2S
Deposits into reserve follow the parameters set forth in the Free Cash policy. The Stabilization Fund
contribution of $199,973 is enough to keep the fund just above the 5% policy goal. The allocation of
$999,866 to the Capital Stabilization Fund is the second year commitment to build to $4.5 million in support
of the major school construction project. This will raise the fund level to over $3.2 million. The OPEB Trust
contribution is $749,900. This addition will bring the Trust to over $4.1 million. This will reduce our OPEB
liability dollar for dollar.
An additional reserve is the untaxed levy capacity generated by not taxing to the full 2.5%. The ability to
generate an additional $2.1 in revenue at some future date — in the event of an emergency or extraordinary
circumstances give the Town financial flexibility in the future. This capacity adds to the untaxed levy from
FY13(1%)and FY15 (1.25%).
Expenditures Not Requiring P,ppropriations
Cherry Sheet Charges
This budget item is estimated to increase by 4% or $236,287. However, there have been years where
certain charges increase by much more than that. The Governor's budget is $225,000 higher in this budget
category-this will have to be monitored as the state budget progresses through the House and the Senate.
Since these charges are not an item voted by Town Meeting, we can make changes within this category at
any time. If we need to make changes in other budgets or revenue estimates to fund an increase in these
items, we can do that in the Fall Town Meeting.
Tax Burden Reserve
This reserve is funded at $700,000 which is the amount needed offset an increase to the residential tax bill
if we have to shift one point to keep the tax burden at 60/40%.

Water Department
The FY16 recommended budget for the Water Department is $20,489,559; which is a $15,243 decrease
from FY15. Total personnel costs increase by $142,618 (4.8%),driven by step increases and COLA changes.
Operating costs are $1.85 million, an increase of $22,834 (1.2%). Small capital costs are level funded.
The major drivers of Water Department costs are always the MWRA assessment and debt service. This
year debt service decreases $641,180 or 10.5% to $5,443,109. This is primarily due to limited borrowing for
prior year projects. As mention in the general fund budget section on debt service, the Finance Division has
spent a good deal of time measuring cash flow and matching borrowing to that cash flow- always
borrowing in arrears. Debt service is 26% of the total Water Department budget.
The MWRA Assessment increases $411,755 or 5.3% to $8.2 million. This is the preliminary assessment
issued by the MWRA. In many years this amount decreases slightly in its final form. The MWRA
assessment is 40% of the total Water Department budget, so any change has a significant impact on the
budget.
Sewer Department
The FY216 recommended Sewer Department budget is $25,701,372; which is an increase of $628,983 or
2.5%. Total personnel costs of $2.7 million increase by $166,525 (6.5%). This increase includes a
reclassification of a medium equipment operation to a supervisory position; the remaining increase is step
increases and COLA allowances as specified by contract. Operating costs increase by $33,235 which is 1.9%
As with the Water Department budget the primary cost drivers in this budget are the MWRA assessment
and debt service. The MWRA draft assessment is a substantial increase from $11.3 million to just over $12
million — an increase of $736,497 or 6.5%. The MWRA assessment is 51% of the total Sewer Department
budget. Sewer debt service is often subsidized by the state in the form of an appropriation to the
Department of Revenue. We will be watching the state budget to determine the impact on this assessment
increase.
Debt service, on the other hand is decreasing by $352,476 (-4.4%)to $7,650,939. As explained above, a
concerted effort has been made to measure capital project cash flow and borrow only what is need to
support what has been already expended.
Rates
Water and Sewer rates are a function of both the increase (or decrease) in costs and the level of
consumption, in the form of units of water used. Usage has been declining, forcing the rates upward. This
is still the case; however, it is mitigated by a moderate increase in the sewer budget and a decrease in the
water budget. The rate forecast presented last year anticipated a substantial increase in sewer rates
(15.3%)and water rates (13.6%); which now appears will be greatly reduced.

The
Stabilization Fund is
the
Town's
"
rainy

fund".
The
Town
policy
setsa
fund
goal
of
5% 
of
the
total
operating 
budget. 
The
FY16
appropriation 
recommendedof
$
199,
973
is
simply
the
amount
that
would 
keep
the
fund 
at
5% 
ofthte
total 
budget. 
The
5% 
policy
goal
was
acheived in 
FY13;
it
just
needs 
to 
be 
maintained 
which
this
recommendation does. 
The
Reserve
Fund is
the
amountset
aside
for
emergenciesthat
occur
during
the
fiscal 
year. It 
is 
distributed by
the
Finance
Committee. It 
is 
level
funded
for
FY16.

coveragefor
current
and
future 
retirees. 
The
Town
was
required to 
record 
this 
liability on 
its
financial
statementsin 
2008. 
The
2008
valuation 
totaled$
216
million. 
After
bargained 
changesto 
health 
insurancethat
included 
retirees 
changing to 
Medicare, the
valuation in 
2010
was
reducedfo 
$
202
million, 
still 
a
mind 
boggling 
amount
which 
would 
require an
appropriation of
$
16
million in 
the
first 
year. 
In 
2011 
and
2012
bargained 
health 
insurance
agreements 
further
reducedthe
overall
cost
and
the
cost
to
the
Town
leading to
a
2012
valuation of
$
184.6
million. 
The

the

allocation
from 
an

This

However
some

processing 
requests
that

throughthe

The
Town
Clerk, 
Assisfiant
Town 
Clerk 
and 
Elections 
Coordinator
provide
extra 
counter
support
when 
necessaryto 
avoid 
lengthy
delays
for
the
Town's
customers. 
In 
July
2009
the
State
Legislature
amended
laws
that
directly 
affect 
municipal
clerks' 
operations. 
Effective 
September29, 
2009, 
the 
new
Conflictof
Interest
Law
assigned 
responsibilityto
cities 
and
townsto 
provideall 
municipal
employeesand 
elected 
and
appointed 
officials 
with 
summariesof
the 
State 
Conflictof
Interest
Law
on
an 
annual
basis, 
record 
recipients' 
receipts of
the
summariesand 
notify
these
same
individualsthat
online
training 
and
testing 
must
be
completed on
a
biennial 
basis. In 
Framinghamthe
Town
Clerk 
has
assumedthis
responsibility. 
Effective
July 
1, 
2010
the
amended 
Open 
Meeting 
Law
required 
Clerksto 
post 
meetingsand 
agendasin 
a
location 
where
they
are 
availablefor
viewing by
the 
public 
twenty 
four
hoursa
day, 
seven 
daysa
week. 
These
state 
mandates
have
substantially
increasedthe
workload in 
the
Clerk's
office. 
The
department's
goals
are
to 
provide 
competent, 
courteousand
efficient
serviceto 
our
customersand 
to 
preservefihe 
Town's
vital

budget. 
For
FY
2016a
modest

been 
requested. 
Additionally, in

on
two

as
to 
avoid
the 
need
to

In

from

Capital 
Budgetto
the
cemetery
operating 
budget. 
These
funds
will 
be 
used
for 
mound
tomb 
restoration. Both 
the 
Main
Street
and
Old 
South 
Cemeteries
include 
mound
tombs
dating 
back
to
1810
and 
1826, 
respectively. 
Mound
tombs
are 
commonly
found
throughout
historic 
burying 
groundsin 
New
England
and
are
typically 
built
into 
an
embankment, with 
a
majorityof
the
structure 
located 
below
grade. 
Common
construction 
styles
include
stone
walls
and
stone
slab 
roofs, or
brick
arched 
vaultson
stone
foundations. The
exposed 
portion of
the
structure
often
includesthe
tomb
access, 
which is 
usually
sealed 
with
some
form 
of
stone 
masonryor
a
steel
door. 
Due
to
the
mound 
tomb
being 
protected by
earth
on
the
top
and
three
sides, 
problems
mostoften 
arise
with 
the
exposed

recent
years, 
repairsto
the

the 
mound

have
increased in 
frequencyand

Loring 
Arena's
primary
function is
to 
provide
stable 
and 
reliable 
recreational

Framingham 
Residents. The
arena 
provides
servicesfor 
II 
ages
and 
abilities 
including 
pre-
school-
seniors, as
well
as
special 
needs. 
These
interests 
range
from
competitive
sports
including

high 
chool
teams, 
college 
hockey, 
figure

has
focusedon 
preserving its 
infrastructurefor
the
long

picture. 
We
are
focusing on 
maintainingthe
existing 
mechanical
systems, 
~
nmonia
detectors, 
boiler
controls, and 
building 
systems
while 
making
appropriate 
modification 
when
needed. 
Many
other

defer
these
concernsin 
the 
terestof
balancingthe
operational 
budget. As
a
result
their
investmentsare
lost
and 
assets
depleted 
overa
15
to
20
year
period. 
Loring is 
currently50 
:
ars
old 
and 
is 
considered by
many
skating 
enthusiaststo 
be
one
of
the
finest 
municipal
skating
facilities in 
the
State. It 
is 
predicted 
that
this 
year's
revenue 
ill 
exceed
the
operational 
appropriation. Many
residents
considerthe
arenato 
be
a
distinctive

move that town meeting vote to raise and appropriafie, transfer firom available funds
or otherwise provide $120,000 to fund the economic development activities of the
Framingham Economic Development Industrial Corporation {EDIC).
..  •
Background f~aterial for Article 18:
This article seeks Town Meeting approval of funding in the amount of $120,000 for the
Economic Development Industrial Corporation (FDIC). The Framingham FDIC was
established stimulate economic development and expand employment opportunities in
the Town of Framingham in accordance with the town's approved economic
development plans. Each fiscal year, the FDIC develops a work plan of projects to
complete in support of existing economic development plans. Recent projects include
marketing plans, redevelopment plans, beautification program and downtown
revitalization.
The requested funding level reflects no change from FY15. Past and planned FDIC
activities often extend beyond the June 30 deadline fixed in municipal budgeting. The
FDIC budget, when implemented as a separate appropriation, will allow for greater
program flexibility. The FDIC program will still be developed and coordinated in
cooperation with the Community and Economic Development Division..
The FDIC is executing a work plan derived from the Economic Development Self-
Assessment(EDSAT). The EDSAT provides a roadmap for the Town, identifying
opportunities to improve competitiveness and attractiveness as a location for business
investment and job creation.
In FY16, the FDIC plans to focus on the following activities:
~  • •  •  t l l l
This funding furthers implementation of a marketing plan the FDIC adopted in 2014.
The marketing plan purpose is to raise awareness of Framingham as business-friendly
location to invest and create jobs. The marketing plan targets business leaders and
their advisors (bankers, brokers, development managers, etc.), in Framingham and
beyond, providing information about the Town's advantages and readiness to support

business. Marketing elements include an electronic newsletter, public ~ media
relations, events, and social media.
This funding expands a successful FY14 pilot program, providing matching funds to
help businesses improve signage, facades, and landscaping in highly visible areas
throughout the Town. The Beautification program purpose is to help business owners
improve the attractiveness of (heir properties and catalyze further investment in the
general area. Physical improvements include exterior painting, sign installation and
upgrades, facade improvements, and parking lot surface improvements. FY14, the
program provided $33,000 to 10 projects, matched by $49,000 in private investment.

This funding continues to provide CED staff with resources to support engagement
with businesses considering Framingham for investment and job creation. With these
tools, CED staff can quickly respond to business queries, identify, and act on

This funding provides a stipend for an intern dedicated to supporting the FDIC. The
purpose of hiring an intern is to enhance CED staff support to the FDIC.

the Town can learn of new trends &best practices, as well as demonstrate readiness
to engage with potential investors. Networks and events also provide the FDIC and

Background Material for Article 19:
On September 2, 2014, the Town foreclosed on the property situated at 618 Waverly
Street(also known as Silton Glass Company) for unpaid real estate property taxes
and accumulated late fees and interest totaling $115,000. Located at the corner of
Mellen Street and Waverly Street, the parcel foreclosed upon did not include a small,
separate parcel located exactly at the corner of this intersection, but a tax title lien will
be placed on that smaller property within the next 60 days.
The normal course of events would call for an auction to be scheduled and the parcel
sold to the highest bidder. However, due to the irregular shape of the lot as it currently
exists, the Town has delayed proceeding to auction. Inasmuch as the Town owns the
abutting Cedar Swamp parcel, the possibility exists to realign or reconfigure the
property boundaries of the Silton Glass parcel to create a more regularly shaped
parcel and one that would be more likely to be developed for a higher and better use.
This article, therefore, seeks authorization from Town Meeting to:
Combine a small portion of the Town's Cedar Swamp land (Parcel C) with the
Silton Glass parcel and to retain a portion of the Silton Glass parcel (Parcel D)
to replace it; and
Page 216
2015 Annuai Town fVleeting  Financial Articles 5-24
• Offer for sale a portion of the Town's Cedar Swamp land (Parcel A) and
replace it with a portion of the Silton Glass parcel (Parcel B). The competitive
process for selling Parcel A will be determined by the Mass. Municipal
Procurement Act. Presumably, the most mofiivated bidder for the parcel,
however, is an adjacent business with insufficient parking which currently
leases a portion of Silton Glass.
This proposal supports the following goals:
• Recover the X115,000 in unpaid property taxes and additional interest in a short
period of time
• Eliminate blighted conditions at the Silton Glass parcel and adjacent properties,
including Town property
• Develop, improve and beautify access to the Town's property known as Cedar
Swamp
• Create higher and better use of improved market value

move that Town Meeting vote transfer from Free Cash $709,245.04 for the one-time
payment to Keefe Vocational Technical School for the Framingham share of the roof
replacement project.
Backaround Material for Article 20:
This article seeks Town Meeting approval to appropriate, from Free Cash,
$709,254.04 to pay for the Framingham share of the Keefe Technical School Roof
replacement project. At the 2014 Annual Town n/leeting the estimated cost for the
Framingham portion of the roof replacement project was estimated at $899,204. This
project is now complete and came in under budget for a final cost for Framingham of
$709,245.04. The CFO's recommendation is to appropriate Free Cash to pay this cost,
thus avoiding interest and borrowing costs. Paying cash for this one-time assessment
means it does not increase our debt profile.

Background Material for Article 21:
This article seeks Town Meeting authorization to create a new Open Space and
Conservation Special Purpose Account to assist in implementing the Town's Open
Space and Recreation Plan (OSRP).
The creation of an Open Space &Conservation Special Purpose Account will provide
a funding mechanism to implement goals and objectives of the Open Space and
Recreation Plan (OSRP).
The Open Space and Recreation Plan Implementation Working Group (OSRPIWG)
and Town Departments including Conservation Commission, Community &Economic
Development, and Planning Board have collaboratively been working on implementing
the Town's 2013 Open Space and Recreation Plan (OSRP) including strengthening
the open space priority list, conducting an analysis of open space opportunities on the
south side, and researching funding tools.
Examples of expenditures from this account include (but are not limited to):
• Removal/remedy of illegal dumping on Conservation Commission lands;
• Tree plantings and other ways to `soften' the streetscape;
• Improvements, establishment, or maintenance of community trails;
• Improvements, establishment, or maintenance of community gardens; and

Background Material for Article 22:
This article seeks Town Meeting approval to update the salary schedule for temporary
seasonal personnel (T schedule). The temporary seasonal pay scale has not been
changed since 2011. The lower steps are now below minimum wage and our top
steps are below the rate paid by surrounding communities. The Town utilizes the T
pay scale to recruit many seasonal and summer positions, including lifeguards for
three beaches, camp counselors and maintenance labor. In recent years the demand
for trained lifeguards has increased and we have to staff three beaches. We have
competition in surrounding communities, the many state parks in MetroWest, and the
private sector including apartment complexes and health clubs. We are also having
difficulty recruiting qualified seasonal laborers because many employers' now hire
temporary staff in the summer and many school systems pay more for seasonal
maintenance laborers.

The Town currently has one pay scale for all Division and Department Heads/Senior
Managers, with the exception of Public Safety Managers, who are currently classified
under a separate pay scale designated as the PSNI scale. There are currently four
employees covered under this separate PSM pay scale and the salary ranges have
not been updated since 2011. The four Public Safety Managers that operate under
this scale function as Senior Managers in the town and in some instances fill in for
their respective Division Heads when they are on vacation or attending professional
trainings. In an effort to keep all Senior Managers on the same pay scale, Human
Resources proposes eliminating the PSM scale and placing these employees on the
current Division and Department Heads/Senior Management scale.

This article seeks Town Meeting approval to enter into a PILOT agreement with IVIA
Highway Solar LLC, which is installing solar panels in three locations: the north and
south cloverleaf of the Exit 13 entrance to the (Mass Turnpike and of the Framingham
Service plaza on the Kass Turnpike. The solar equipment installed of these locations
is considered personal property for the purposes of local property taxation. In order to
make fhe financing and cash flow of these kinds of projects feasible, developers look
to create some certainty for the amounts owed in taxes of the financing of the project.
Massachusetts General Law Chapter 59, section 38H (b) allows a municipality to enter
into an agreement fo make a payment instead of paying as a tax. The agreement can
include a fixed payment schedule over time which the solar entity can work into the
financing schedule of the project.
The draft agreement attached to this memo provides the contractual requirements, the
solar equipment locations and the fixed annual amounts that have been reviewed and
deemed acceptable to the administration. The annual payment listed in Exhibit B is
static for the 20 years of the agreement and exceeds the net present value of the total
of 20 years of estimated tax payments projected using a couple of different models.
The original value of the equipment and the depreciation methodology was reviewed
by the Finance Division.
The land on which the solar equipment is located is state land and is not taxable. The
proceeds of the PILOT represent new revenue to the Town. It is counted as a local
receipt, since it is a PILOT payment. We currently receive no tax revenue from these
three parcels and will receive revenue from the equipment located on these three
parcels as a result of this agreement.
THIS AGREEMENT FOR PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES (this "PILOT Agreement" or
"Agreement")is made and entered into as of _ _  ,2015 by and between 1VIA I~IGHWAY
SOLAR I,I,C, a Delaware lunited liability company ("Developer")with an address of 111 Speen Street,
Suite 410, Framingham, MA 01701, and the TOWN OF FRAMINGHAM, a municipal corporation of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts with an address of 150 Concord Street, Framingham, MA 01702 (the
"Town").Developer and the Town are collectively referred to in this PILOT Agreement as the "Parties"
and are individually referred to as a"Party".
WI~REAS, Developer intends to develop, install, build, and operate aground-mounted solar
photovoltaic electric generating facilities (the "Project") on three sites located in Framingham,
Massachusetts as shown on E~ibit A hereto ("Property");
WI~REAS, the Project consists of the following personal property: (a) solar modules, solar
inverter systems, and solar power generating facilities including racking, foundations, support

electricity (the "Solar Facilities");
WHEREAS, Developer and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation ("MOOT")have
entered into a Master Solar License and Power Purchase Agreement (as same may be amended from
time to dine, the"PPA")pursuant to which NIDOT will purchase all electricity generated by the Project;
WI~REAS, because both Developer and the Town need an accurate projection of their
respective expenses and revenues with respect to the real and personal property that is taxable under
law, the Parties believe that it is in their mutual best interests to enter into this Agreement fixing the
payments that will be made with respect to all taxable real and personal property incorporated within the
Project for the term of the Agreement;
WHEREAS, it is the intention of the Parties that Developer inalce annual payments to the Town
for the term of this Agreement in lieu of real and personal property taxes on the Project under the
authority of M.G.L. c. 59, Section 38H and the Massachusetts Department of Revenue regulations
adopted in connection therewith;
WHEREAS, the Panties intend that, during the term of the Agreement, Developer will not be
assessed for any statutory real and personal property taxes to which it might otherwise be subjected
under Massachusetts law, and this Agreement will provide for the exclusive payments in lieu of such
real and personal property taxes that Developer (ar any successor owner of the Project) will be obligated
to make to the Town with respect to the Project during the teen hereof, provided, however, that the
Parties do not intend for this Agreement to affect any direct payments for services provided by the
Town to the Project, including but not limited to, water and sewer services, and similar payment
obligations not in the nature of real or personal property taxes or substitutes for such taxes that
Developer may otherwise be obligated to pay the Town, and
WHEREAS, the Town is authorized to enter into this Agreement with Developer, provided that
payments in lieu of real and personal property taxes over the life of the Agreement are expected at
inception to approximate the property tax payments that would otherwise be determined under G.L. c.59
based upon the full and fair cash valuation of the Project;
WHEREAS, the Parties have reached this Agreement after good faith negotiations;
NOW THEREFORE, in exchange for the mutual commitments and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the Parties agree as follows:
1.  Payment in Lieu of Taxes. From and after the date that the Project is authorized to interconnect
and export power to the local electric utility (the "Commercial Operation Date"), Developer agrees to
snake payments to the Town in lieu of real and personal property taxes in the amounts and in the years
set forth in Exhibit B, such payments to continue until the earlier of(A) termination of the PPA and
removal of the Solar Facilities, and (B) twenty (20) years after the Commercial Operation Date. Each
annual payment shall be made to the Town in two equal installments on or before [May 1] and
[November 1] of each fiscal tax year during the term of this Agreement, and the annual payment amount
and payment date will be noted on a tax bill issued by the Town to the Developer at least thirty days
prior to the due date. The first and last payments shall be pro-rated based on the number of days in the
semi-annual periods, respectively.
Developer agrees that the payments in lieu oftaxes under this Agreement will not be reduced on
account of a depreciation factor, revaluation or reduction in the Town's tax rate or assessment 
c

2015 Annual Town ~/leeting  Financial P,rticles 5-24
percentage which factors have been anticipated by the Parties and are reflected in E~ibit B, and the
Town agrees that the payments in lieu of taxes will not be increased on account of an inflation factor,
revaluation or increase in the Town's tax rate or assessment percentage which factors have been
anticipated by the Parties and are reflected in E~iibit B.
2.  Improvements or Additions, Retirements. No additional payments in lieu of taxes will be due
or required if the capacity of the Project increases on or after the Commercial Operation Date. No
additional payments in lieu of property taxes will be due or required for (i) replacement of personal
property or equipment or machinery that is nonfunctional, obsolete or is replaced solely due to wear and
tear or casualty or as part of scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, or (ii) pollution control or other
equipment that is exempted from taxation by the provisions of General Laws Chapter 59, section 5(44)
or other applicable laws or regulations in effect from time to time, or (iii) equipment installed as
required by or in response to any statute, law, regulation, consent decree, order or case mandating
additional control of any emission or pollution.
3.  Payment Collection. The provisions of General Laws Chapter 60 and other applicable law will

the Town will not assess Developer for any real estate and personal property taxes with respect to the
Project, the Solar Facilities or Developer's occupancy on the Property, to which Developer might
otherwise be subject under Massachusetts law, and the Town agrees that this Agreement will
exclusively govern the payments of all ad valorem real estate and personal property taxes and payments
in lieu of such taxes that Developer will be obligated to make to the Town with respect to the Project,
provided, however, that this Agreement is not intended to affect, and will not preclude, other
assessments of general applicability by the Town for excise taxes on vehicles due pursuant to General
Laws Chapter 60A and for services provided by the Town to the Project, including but not limited to,
water and sewer services. The Town agrees that no real or personal property tomes will be due from or
assessed to Developer other than the payments in lieu of taxes described in this PILOT Agreement.
5.  Successors and Assigns. This Agreement will be binding upon the successors and assigns of
Developer, and the obligations created hereunder will run with the Property and the Project. In the event
that Developer sells, transfers, leases or assigns all or substantially all of its interest in the Project, this
Agreement will thereafter be binding on the purchaser, transferee or assignee. A Notice of this
Agreement may be recorded by Developer in the applicable Registry of Deeds forthwith upon
execution.
6.  Statement of Good Faith. The Parties agree that the payment obligations established by this
Agreement were negotiated in good faith in recognition of and with due consideration of the full and
fair cash value of the Project, to the extent that such value is determinable as of the date of this
Agreement in accordance with General Laws Chapter 59, §38H. Each Party was represented by counsel
in the negotiation and preparation of this PILOT Agreement and has entered into this PILOT Agreement
after full and due consideration and with the advice of its counsel and its uidependent consultants. The
Parties further acknowledge that this PILOT Agreement is fair and mutually beneficial to them because
it reduces the likelihood of future disputes over real and personal property taxes, establishes tax and
economic stability at a time of continuing transition and economic uncertainty in Massachusetts and the
region, and fixes and maintains mutually acceptable, reasonable and accurate payments in lieu of taxes
for the Project that are appropriate and serve their respective interests. The Town acknowledges that this

and reasonable payments in lieu of taxes to the Town. Developer acknowledges that this Agreement is

Page 228

not exist. The Parties will cooperate with each other, and use reasonable efforts to defend against and
contest any challenge to this Agreement by a third party.
If for any reason including a change in law, it is ever determined that this Agreement only
applies to personal property and not to both real and personal property, then this Agreement will be
deemed to apply only to personal property, and the Town will thereafter be entitled to assess and taY the
real property in accordance with G.L. c. 59 and G.L. c. 60, and Developer will be entitled to challenge
such assessments and taxes in accordance with Massachusetts law. Under such circumstances, this
Agreement will not apply to such real estate taxes and the payments in lieu of taxes due under this
Agreement shall be decreased on an annual basis by the amount of real estate taxes actually paid to the
Town for each year.
If for any reason including a change in law, it is ever determined that this Agreement only
applies to real estate and not to both real and personal property, then this Agreement shall terminate as
of the date of such determination. This section 8 shall survive termination.
