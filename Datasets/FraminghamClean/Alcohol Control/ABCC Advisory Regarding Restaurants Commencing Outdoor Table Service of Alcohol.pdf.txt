ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES CONTROL COMMISSION ADVISORY REGARDING
RESTAURANTS COMMENCING OUTDOOR TABLE SERVICE OF ALCOHOL
On June 6, 2020, Governor Charlie Baker declared that the Commonwealth had entered Phase II
of its reopening plan. According to the Governor and the Executive Office of Housing and
Economic Development, licensees for on-premises consumption of alcohol may commence
outdoor seated service, provided food is prepared on-site under a retail food permit issued by a
municipal authority pursuant to 105 CMR 590.000. 
Indoor service remains prohibited until further order from the Governor. 
Please note that establishments that do not offer seated table service of food that is prepared on-
site under a retail food permit are not allowed to open in Phase II. 
Please refer to your Local Board for guidance on outdoor seating. 
The ABCC continues to retain supervision and oversight of all alcohol licensees, including those
that expand their licensed premises pursuant to this Order. As always, all licensees must ensure 
that they comply with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and that sales of
alcoholic beverages take place only as authorized by federal, state, and local law. All questions
should be directed to Executive Director Ralph Sacramone at (617) 727-3040 x 731.
