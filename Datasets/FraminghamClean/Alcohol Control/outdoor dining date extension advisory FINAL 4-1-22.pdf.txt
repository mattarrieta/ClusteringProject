ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES CONTROL COMMISSION ADVISORY
REGARDING THE FURTHER EXPANSION OF PATIO SERVICE AND
TAKEAWAY/DELIVERY OF ALCOHOL BY ON-PREMISES LICENSEES
On April 1, 2022, Governor Charlie Baker signed into law “An Act making appropriations for
fiscal year 2022 to provide for supplementing certain existing appropriations and for certain other
activities and projects.” The text of the legislation can be found [URL: "https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/H4578/Amendments/Senate"] HERE. 
This Act permits licensees for on-premises consumption to continue with (1) expanded patio
service and (2) extends the ability to sell alcoholic beverages for takeaway and delivery: 
Patios/Outdoor Expansions:  licensees that have been approved for expanded
patio/outdoor service may continue their outdoor operations until April 1, 2023. 
Licensees that seek to continue patio/outdoor service after April 1, 2023, are encouraged
to apply in the ordinary course for an alteration of premises with their local licensing
authorities. Otherwise, these amended licenses automatically revert to the status prior to
the approval of the expansion of outdoor service as of April 1, 2023. 
Takeaway/delivery of alcohol: establishments licensed for on-premises consumption of
alcohol may continue takeaway and delivery sales of alcohol until April 1, 2023. All
alcohol sold for takeaway/delivery must be sold with food and at the same price as alcohol
for on-premises consumption. 
Please be aware that the ABCC will be holding a public hearing on Thursday, April 7, 2022, at
12:00 p.m. to discuss proposed guidelines for the operation of patios/outdoors alcohol service. 
Information regarding the public hearing and the proposed guidelines will be available on the
ABCC’s website at [URL: "http://www.mass.gov/abcc"] www.mass.gov/abcc. 
As always, all licensees must ensure that they comply with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and that sales of alcoholic beverages take place only as authorized by federal, state, 
and local law. All questions should be directed to the ABCC Executive Director Ralph Sacramone
at rsacramone@tre.state.ma.us or (617) 727-3040 x 731.
