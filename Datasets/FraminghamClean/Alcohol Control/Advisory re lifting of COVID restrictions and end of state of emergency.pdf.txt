ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES CONTROL COMMISSION ADVISORY
REGARDING THE END OF COVID-RELATED RESTRICTIONS
On May 17, 2021, Governor Charlie Baker announced the lifting of COVID-related restrictions and the
expected date for the end of the Commonwealth’s state of emergency. The details of the Governor’s plans
can be found [URL: "https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-to-lift-covid-restrictions-may-29-state-to-meet-vaccination-goal-by-beginning-of-june"] HERE .
Beginning Saturday, May 29, 2021, all COVID-related restrictions for licensees are lifted and all licensees
can resume normal operations. 
The Governor’s COVID-19 State of Emergency will end Monday, June 15, 2021. The end of the state of
emergency brings with it two important changes: 
Patios/Outdoor Expansions: licensees that have been approved for expanded patio/outdoor
service pursuant to the Governor’s executive orders may continue their outdoor operations for 60
days after the end of the state of emergency, which is Sunday, August 15, 2021. 
The Governor and the Legislature are working on legislation to extend this deadline. However, no
extension has yet been approved. Licensees that seek to continue patio/outdoor service after August
15, 2021, are encouraged to apply in the ordinary course for an alteration of premises with their
local licensing authorities. 
Takeaway/delivery of alcohol: establishments licensed for on-premises consumption of alcohol
must end takeaway and delivery sales of alcohol on June 15, 2021. 
Anyone with questions, comments, or concerns about the end of the state of emergency and its impacts on
licensees should contact the Governor’s Office by calling 2-1-1. 
We thank licensees and the local licensing authorities for all their support and compliance during this state
of emergency; we understand this has been a trying time for the entire industry. We continue to be available
to local licensing authorities and licensees going forward. 
Local licensing authorities are reminded that on May 26, 2021, at 10:00 a.m., the ABCC is hosting a virtual
meeting to answer any questions and address concerns from local licensing authorities. All are encouraged
to attend. This call will be recorded for those who cannot attend live. 
As always, all licensees must ensure that they comply with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and that sales of alcoholic beverages take place only as authorized by federal, state, and
local law. All questions should be directed to the ABCC Executive Director Ralph Sacramone at
 rsacramone@tre.state.ma.us or (617) 727-3040 x 731.
