ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES CONTROL COMMISSION ADVISORY
REGARDING THE EXPANSION OF PATIO SERVICE AND TAKEAWAY/DELIVERY OF
ALCOHOL BY ON-PREMISES LICENSEES
On June 16, 2021, Governor Charlie Baker signed into law An Act relative to extending certain COVID-
19 measures adopted during the state of emergency. The text of the legislation can be found [URL: "https://malegislature.gov/Bills/192/S2475"] HERE. 
This Act permits on-premises licensees to continue with (1) expanded patio service and (2) extends the
ability to sell alcoholic beverages for takeaway and delivery: 
Patios/Outdoor Expansions: licensees that have been approved for expanded patio/outdoor
service pursuant to the Governorâ€™s executive orders may continue their outdoor operations until
April 1, 2022. 
Licensees that seek to continue patio/outdoor service after April 1, 2022, are encouraged to apply
in the ordinary course for an alteration of premises with their local licensing authorities. Otherwise, 
these amended licenses automatically revert to the status prior to the approval of the expansion of
outdoor service as of April 1, 2022. 
Takeaway/delivery of alcohol: establishments licensed for on-premises consumption of alcohol
may continue takeaway and delivery sales of alcohol until May 1, 2022. All alcohol sold for
takeaway/delivery must be sold with food and at the same price as alcohol for on-premises
consumption. 
As always, all licensees must ensure that they comply with the laws of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, and that sales of alcoholic beverages take place only as authorized by federal, state, and
local law. All questions should be directed to the ABCC Executive Director Ralph Sacramone at
 rsacramone@tre.state.ma.us or (617) 727-3040 x 731.
