RE: CDBG FUNDS â€” FY 2023 CODS ENFORCEMENT GRANT APPLICATION
Dear Awarding Agent, 
On behalf of the City of Framingham Inspectional Service Division, please consider this letter and the
attached application as a program in need of continued funding. 
Fourteen years ago, this office requested a grant that would supplement the departments overall budget
to assist in "Code Enforcement Activities". The grant monies have been applied to the salary portion of the
budget, which provided opportunity to maintain additional resources and to address the multitude of housing
issues in specific areas of the city. In particular properties identified within the U.S. Census Tracts and Block
Groups. (Tract #'s 383102.02, 383101.01, 383400.03, 383400.02, 383101.02, 383300.01, 383102.01, 
383200.01, 383501.2, 383600.2, 383200.4.)
The grant has provided the department with the ability to refocus its resources to be more pro-active in
its resolve to maintain property values and improve the safety of the people who reside in the City of
Framingham. Through the support of the Mayor, &City Council, the Code Enforcement Task Force that
consists of staff from the following offices: Inspectional Services, Board of Health, CDBG, DPW, Police, Fire
and the Commonwealths' Attorney General's Office, is beginning its' Eighth year. The Task Force is charged
with focusing on specific streets in the target areas. 
The grant as requested and approved in the past is for Code Enforcement with an anticipated service to
650 +/- Households. Code Enforcement activity is tracked on multiple activity data bases. Our IT Department
has customized the towns permitting software (Accela), by integrating mapping programs to assist in
identifying and illustrating action reports.

Code Enforcement is not a visible activity that is immediately recognized by all, it is not an activity that can
always be accomplished with a single action, it is an effective action that does provide results when performed
consistently to address suffering and neglected properties, to reduce congestions and to clean up blighted
conditions. Many of the activities this office pursues require multiple follow ups which absorb a tremendous
amount of time and resources. 
The Town of Framingham was established over 300 years ago, and the City of Framingham 4 Years
ago, still since its establishment the town has undergone multitudes of change. Some of the most economic
beneficial changes occurred in the last 129 years. The most evident of these changes occurred in the down town
area, with large companies developing and constructing large factory style buildings, centralized market places
and the construction of large residential structures in very close proximity to each other. These properties have
been identified within the U.S. Census Tracts and Block Groups. (Tract #'s 383102.02, 383101.01, 383400.03, 
383400.02, 383101.02, 383300.01, 383102.01, 383200.01, 383501.2, 383600.2, 383700.3, 384002.1, 383200.3, 
383400.1) 
In review of the Census Tract and Block Groups, (Tract #'s 383102.02, 383101.01, 383400.03, 383400.02, 
383101.02, 383300.01, 383102.01, 383200.01, 383501.2, 383600.2, 383700.3, 384002.1, 383200.3, 383400.1) 
which represent roughly 5.8 square miles of area, or 25 % of the City of Framingham's gross land area. These
Tracts also represent an estimated 12,000 households or roughly 50% of total households of the town. Due to
the high concentration of households in a limited amount of land area and the changes in population trends as
identified in the last U.S. Census report. Over the past forty years there has been tremendous change in the use
of these residential housing units. With the decrease in family sizes there is less demand for larger houses with
numerous small rooms on multiple levels. The cost of maintenance and property taxes has increased but the
current economic market value has decreased the value of many properties in our focus area. This continues to
result in some properties being illegally (without permits) converted in multiple dwelling units and/or rooming
houses. 
PROPOSAL FOR USE OF CDBG FUNDS
The need to maintain the additional salary funding in addition to funding the operating budget for computers, 
furniture, communications and transportation, if the grant of CDBG Funds of $70,000.00 is re-approved the
funds will continue to supplement the additional funding the City of Framingham has provided to support the
code enforcement positions. If the CDBG grant is re-approved for Code Enforcement the reimbursable funds
will supplement the hourly cost to perform this task at an estimated $150.00 per case or 9.0 cases per week.

In 2021 the Code Enforcement Inspectors monitored over 82 foreclosed properties within the City of
Framingham this number represents less than 1% of the number of residential properties within the city. The
Code Enforcement inspectors maintain a data base to track properties, banks and other interested parties. This
type of action has assisted in maintaining the property values of neighboring properties by monitoring and
pursuing conditions that would cause further deterioration of vacant properties. However, these foreclosed
property issues have taken time away from the actual code enforcement program as designed. Since its
inception the code enforcement program has been very successful in dealing with issues that include; illegal
apartments, vehicles parking in front setbacks, construction projects without permits, multi-family inspections
and multiple cases of rooming house type living conditions, nuisance violations and slum and blighted
properties. 
A majority of the inspectors' time involves research of records, providing written notices to property
owners, court time, performing site visits, and monitoring for compliance with additional follow- up. The
average time each inspector is anticipated to be working at a minimum is 4-8 cases per day or between 20 and
40 cases per week. It is Feasible that a minimum of half of the cases will be for those properties in areas
designated on the U.S. Tract and Block Groups identified above. The Inspectional Services Department will be
monitoring the performance of the code enforcement by means of the "Code Enforcement Tracking SheeY'. The
information obtained and findings have been included within the Code Enforcement Activity sheet(s), which
have been provided to the granting authority for their records. 
I thank you for your consideration of this request and if I can provide answers to any other questions, 
please contact my office (508) 532-5500.
