definitions are included as attachments):
❑ Benefits low/moderate income individuals/households 
❑ Addresses the prevention or elimination of slums or blight 
❑ Meets an urgent community need threatening health and welfare
Check all statements that describe HOW this project or activity meets at least one of the National
Objectives listed above:

of those jobs must be available to low- and moderate-income persons. Examples may include
loans to pay for the expansion of a factory, assistance to a business which has publicly announced

Appendix A
Evaluation Criteria
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds are awarded through a competitive proposal
evaluation process. The evaluation considers all aspects of the proposal as described in the RFP and
proposal application. 
Proposals are checked first by the City’s Planning and Community Division staff for completeness of
application, content and eligibility under CDBG guidelines. Eligible applicants will have proposals
reviewed and ranked by members of the Community Development Committee using the City of
Framingham’s Application Evaluation Worksheet. If a question arises during its review, the committee
reserves the right to contact the applicant for clarification. Based on the committee’s review and
ranking of proposals, recommendations will be presented to the Mayor’s Office, which will render the
final decision on grant awards. Ultimately, the City Council votes to accept or reject the annual
aggregate federal funds before the Annual Action Plan is submitted and the funds dispersed. 
The Division of Planning and Community Development and the Community Development Committee
will have sole discretion on the approval of funds. Committee has discretion to partially or fully fund a
proposal. Please note that a well-written application is no guarantee of funding since this is a highly
competitive process. Applicants should give adequate attention to the completeness, conciseness, and
responsiveness of the information provided in response to the questions asked within the application. 
The RFP will be the only time for organizations to present proposals since no future meetings or
hearings are scheduled between the submission date and allocation date. Please contact the
Community Development Department at communitydevelopment@framinghamma.gov if you have any
questions concerning the Evaluation Worksheet or the application.

B. Project Narrative
Please provide a narrative description of your proposed project or program by answering the
following questions. We recommend that you include the question as part of your response. 
Responses must not exceed 10 pages. 
1. Need and Outcomes: 
a. Why are you seeking to undertake this work (need)?
MAPS’ proposed program continuation follows over 50 years of experience supporting the
Portuguese-speaking communities of Massachusetts in a linguistically and culturally competent
manner. These decades of experience have provided us with a wealth of insight into the culture
and habits of our constituents and have allowed us to continually improve our programs and
the models to increase access and remove barriers to health, education and social services
through direct services, advocacy, leadership, and community development. MAPS has
successfully completed many projects through federal, state and local contracts as well as
foundation and corporate support to serve the Portuguese-speaking communities of
Massachusetts. 
MAPS’ recent four-year Community Needs and Services Assessment of the Portuguese-speaking
populations in Framingham and surrounding areas of MetroWest, commissioned by MAPS, 
continues to inform our work. It demonstrates continuing need for services around
employment, referrals to health care and insurance, and a variety of basic needs. 
b. Why do you believe your organization is best positioned to address this need? MAPS
remains uniquely qualified to provide services to the large Portuguese-speaking immigrant
population (counted and considered variously as Latino, White, Black or often multiracial) in
Framingham. MAPS’ has over 50 years of experience supporting the Portuguese-speaking
communities of Massachusetts to increase access and remove barriers to health, education and
social services through direct services, advocacy, leadership, and community development.

2021—including more than 120 through Framingham immigrant integration and general
services. The IIS program, the most sought-after service at all MAPS offices, has existed since
1970 – and in Framingham and surrounding MetroWest communities since 2006. Throughout
its existence, the IIS Program has successfully assisted Portuguese speakers along a pathway to
self-sufficiency and integration in the United States of America.
