Sponsor: Board of Selectmen
April 24, 2012 Voted: 
Whereas, corporations should not be considered natural persons with constitutional rights equal
to the rights of real people; 
Whereas, corporations are created by the people and are subject to regulation by the people; 
Whereas, the present system of campaign financing is dramatically diluting the voice of
Americans who do not control a large corporate treasury by enabling anonymous corporate
super-PACs to overwhelm voters and threaten public officials with massive negative campaign
advertising; 
Whereas, it is not in the interest of our democratic form of government that corporations be able
to make any campaign contributions or election expenditures; 
Whereas, the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Citizens United v FEC presents a serious and direct
threat to our democracy; 
Whereas, Congress and the States have the power to regulate campaign finances; 
Therefore, be it resolved that the Town of Framingham calls upon the Great and General Court
of the Commonwealth to support a resolution requesting Congress to pass and send to the States
for ratification a constitutional amendment to give Congress and the States the power to regulate
and set reasonable limits on all election contributions and expenditures, including a candidate’s
own spending, and to authorize the establishment of political committees to receive, spend and

To see if the Town will vote to request that the Board of Selectmen petition the
legislature to pass a Special Act that will address the inequities in assessing practices of
residential and commercial properties. 
Sponsor: Citizens’ Petition
May 22, 2012 Voted: Whereas there are inequities in assessing practices of residential
and commercial properties, 
Whereas Chapter 3 of the Acts of 2004 SECTION 2 (a) directed the department of
revenue, to determine sustainable and equitable methods for addressing the current and
any future divergence in residential and commercial and industrial property values and
that no action has been taken to address this issue, 
Whereas on December 2004, the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, Division of
Local Services provided a Tax Classification Report and this report ended with the
following statement: “We also suggest that consideration be given to using sale prices to
value larger CIP properties that may be acquired on a speculative basis when the income
approach significantly undervalues the property” and that no action has been taken in
response to this suggestion. 
Therefore, it is the will of Framingham Town Meeting that the Framingham legislators
file Special Acts with the Massachusetts General Court to address the inequities in
assessing practices of residential and commercial properties. These acts should require
acceptance by a community with the option to revoke such acceptance. The Department
of Revenue could allow assessors to: 
Consideration A: Tax Rate for Apartments
Tax apartments and residential properties with four (4) or more units at the commercial
rate rather than at the residential rate, to recognize that apartments may be acquired on a
speculative basis and are a business, 
Consideration B: Consider Short Sales
Consider short sales when determining the average value in an area,

ARTICLE 40 (CONTINUED)
Consideration C: Consider Sale Price
Consider sales price when determining assessments when it exceeds the assessment using
the value method, 
Consideration D: Tax Surcharge
Apply a tax surcharge of up to 10% of the tax for the previous year when a commercial or
industrial organization does not provide the required income form in a timely manner or
provides an incomplete form. The property owner would be notified by registered mail
that that the required form was not received when due and would have 14 days to provide
the form before the treasurer would be notified to send out a surcharge bill. 
Consideration E: Limit on Tax Increase
Limit the annual increase in the tax on a property to an increase of 10 percent over the tax
for the previous year provided that no enhancements to the property were made. The tax
in excess of 110 percent of the previous year’s tax would be allowed as an abatement. If
the total of all abatements exceeds the budget the excess would be an expense in the
following year’s budget.

ARTICLE 41
Proposed Framingham by-law intended to reduce the production or dispersion of lung
irritants, poisons and potential carcinogens by air, through banning the use of mechanical
leaf blowers. 
Proposed: That no Framingham town department, governmental agency or any
employee of said agencies may use or hire for use any mechanical device, either gasoline
powered or electrical, to move sand, dirt, dust, leaves, grass or other debris from lands, 
parking lots, paved surfaces or terrain of any kind, within the town boundaries of the
town of Framingham, Massachusetts. Only traditional rake, brooms or vehicular street
sweepers may be used for these purposes on town property. Be it further enacted that no
commercial landscaping company or self-employed landscaper may utilize such devices
in lieu of traditional raking or sweeping tools on any public or private lands or property, 
anywhere in the town of Framingham. Such mechanical leaf-blowing devices may be
employed by individual property owners on their residential property only, if due care is
given to mitigate the production of lung-damaging particulate into the neighboring
atmosphere and adjacent public roadways. It is the intention of this law to reduce the
level of lung irritants and related diseases of the lungs within the town of Framingham. 
This bylaw is not intended to prohibit the use of lawnmowers or municipal street
sweepers.

May 16, 2012 Voted: Be it resolved that this Town Meeting wishes to express its
concern with the long term potential impacts of stagnating commercial properties and the
recent decline in growth in new commercial development. Historically thriving
commercial properties and new commercial development have been an important source
of growth in the tax base upon which the Town could rely for new revenue, and for which
the Town is dependent to endure the continuation of all Town services without shifting
the cost of growth to much higher residential taxation or reducing services. 
Also, be it resolved that this Town Meeting respectfully requests that the Board of
Selectmen and Town Manager review the structure and organization of all aspects of
Economic Development. Such review should include an evaluation of the Town’s
economic development mission, leadership, organization, priorities, budget, staffing, and
administrative lines of reporting in order to re-focus the attention, priorities and staffing
on specific quantitative and qualitative economic development goals and the tasks
required to achieve them, and further, that those goals be measured against results on a
quarterly basis to preserve, protect and expand the continued long term growth of
Framingham’s tax base.
