B. PROJECTED USE OF FEDERAL FY 2010, LOCAL FISCAL YEAR 2011 (THIRTY SIXTH YEAR) 
FUNDS 
The Town expects to have available an estimated $655,750 in CDBG funds in FY ’11 (FFY ’10).
1.0  ADMINISTRATION AND PLANNING  $126,840
Funding for staff, supplies, technical assistance and operating expenses necessary to administer and
plan the Community Development Block Grant Program and other related grants.
2.0  HOUSING REHABILITATION 
2.1  HOUSING REHABILITATION/ HOMEOWNERSHIP ASSISTANCE PROGRAM $155,945 
SPONSOR: Framingham Community and Economic Development Department
HRAP plans to assist lower-income owners of approximately 8-10 households of owner-occupied
structures, and 2 to 3 rental units (the majority of which are occupied by lower income tenants), and
owners of blighted properties in specified target neighborhoods to finance repairs to their properties. Small
direct cash grants and loans will be provided ranging up to $16,000, grant and low interest or deferred
loan basis, for an owner occupied unit, to $6,000 per renter occupied unit, on a loaned basis only (when
matched dollar for dollar with owner private funds).. Additional grant funds will be made available to lower
income homeowners and properties (where the majority of tenants are low income) in lower income
neighborhoods to carry out exterior rehabilitation in tandem with code related rehab. Grant amounts, loan
amounts, and repayment terms will vary according to number of dwelling units in the structure and the
income of its residents. While use of funds to undertake broad repairs and improvements will be focused on
specific target neighborhoods, funds can be used to address emergency repair needs, such as heating
system and roofing repairs, of low income property owners and of owners of rental properties who agree to
rent the majority of units in a structure to low income tenants for five years in any area of town. In addition to
grants and loans, technical assistance on financial and rehabilitation matters is provided. Funding of this
component provides capacity for the Town to receive MassHousing Home Improvement Loan Program
funds and other programs. As a separate component funds will also be used to provide home ownership
assistance through counseling and partial down payment and closing cost assistance and/or subsidies
and guarantees. A special emphasis will remain on increasing ownership, investment, and stability in the
Town’s oldest and densest neighborhoods. These funds represent a “building block” resource that can
be readily combined in a modular, complementary fashion to other resources, such as Neighborhood
Stabilization (NSP) funds to save, stabilize and improve the Town’s residential neighborhoods. 
2.2  CODE ENFORCEMENT 
SPONSOR: Town of Framingham Inspectional Services 
$60,232
The Town of Framingham has identified a need for stronger code enforcement to address substandard
housing and overcrowded housing conditions. The Town requests CDBG funds to pay for code
enforcement in designated neighborhoods with many substandard or deteriorated buildings or areas with
concentrated low- or moderate-income populations. CDBG funds will be used to pay for Town inspectors
doing housing code inspections in low - to moderate-income neighborhoods. Housing code violations will

be required to be corrected by the property owners, and may work in cooperation with the Housing

SPONSOR: Town of Framingham Division of Public Works

tutoring, tutoring in conversational English to limited English speakers, counseling, job development, 
General Equivalency Diploma (GED) preparation and materials, and student and maintenance of tutor
support networks. In FY2009 479 Framingham students were served, including an additional 159
students through their English Survival group. 84.4% of the students enrolled were ESOL students, and
15.6% were ABE or GED preparation students. On-site tutoring will also be increased. CDBG funds
support the administrative staff to recruit, train, and retain hundreds of volunteer tutors. The program will
enhance basic literacy instruction by hiring a reading consultant to evaluate students initially and on an
on-going basis, develop a learning plan for each low level literacy student, and provide guidance to tutors
as they work with these students. The program will increase tutor support to retain tutors fort more than
one year. Group programs that were piloted include classes on coping with stress, U.S. Culture and a
discussion group based on a Public Broadcasting System “novella” expressly developed for learning
English and a group of people combining crafts and English conversation. In FY2009 two additional
conversation groups were added to the already existing 5. LU will serve newcomers and low income

SPONSOR: Community Connections Action Team/Framingham Coalition 
$26,000
Funding is being requested to provide a youth summer work program to employ a total of 30 teens (ages
14 to 17) that live in low socioeconomic Framingham neighborhoods. The program will operate during
the summer months for two and a half weeks in which teens will learn responsibility and investment in
their community by implementing appropriate landscaping, general clean up, painting, maintenance skills, 
and work together as a team by completing projects assigned to them. Because this will be a first job for
most, teens will also learn the interview process and how to complete a job application. These sessions
are supervised (on-site) by two adults who have numerous years of experience working with youth in both
a school and community settings. The program will involve orientation and in later phase participation in
enrichment sessions on safety and health issues provided by the Framingham police department, metro
west medical Center, and Parks and Recreation.

prep classes. Students will attend the Summer Institute for four weeks in July 2010, from 9:00 am to 3:00
pm. Incoming RFL freshmen who need math and writing support will be referred into the program. Math
programs will focus on important elements of Algebra I to facilitate a smooth transition to 9th grade math. 
Students will learn the essential tools of algebra, linear systems, functions and equations, matrices, and
polynomial functions. English skills will focus on developing an analytical essay, reading and discussing 2
required summer reading selections, grammar, and vocabulary decoding skills. The MCAS and SAT prep

danger of eviction, in need of funds for security and last months deposits to obtain permanent housing.

agencies will work together to select recipients that best meet the criteria for these housing stabilization
grants. Clients will be chosen for assistance who are able to financially sustain continued payment of their
housing costs after intervention by the program. Metrowest Outreach Connection’s mission includes the

on-one mentoring, community engagement, healthcare information, and other social services that
improve the quality of life for themselves and their families. Students may earn a monthly stipend through
their documented work in a community agency related to their coursework. Monthly field trips to
educational, cultural, and science institutions will be determined by the student’s interests. The proposed
program will be conducted during the evening hours of 6:00—9:00 p.m., eliminating transportation
barriers that exist and offers a comprehensive approach, including familial support to the student. 
Concerted outreach efforts will be made to Hispanic and black youth to ensure participation. A family
night will be offered once per month where student progress will be reported to the parent or legal
guardian. The funds will directly pay the part-time program coordinator, program supplies, and costs
associated with weekly programs speakers and instructors and related materials.

ARTICLE 36
To see if the Town will vote to amend its Zoning By-law by adding the following: 
Section I.F Wireless Communications Facilities Temporary Moratorium
1. Purpose and Intent
The increasing use of business and personal devices relying on personal wireless service
facilities, often referred to as wireless communications facilities, particularly recent
changes and trends in the wireless communications industry, such as the advent of 3G
and 4G networks, new technologies for wireless communications facilities, and other
advances, have generated a significant number of applications for the placement, 
construction and modification of such facilities in the Town in recent months. Given the
rapidly evolving nature of the underlying technology, the Town needs time to review and
analyze these changes, advances, and trends in a meaningful and thoughtful way and the
range of land use and regulatory issues raised by such facilities. 
Section IV.L of the Zoning By-law, which governs Wireless Communications Facilities, 
was enacted in 1997, soon after the enactment of the federal Telecommunications Act in
1996. Since then, the technology for wireless communications, and wireless
communications facilities, has changed and advanced at a rapid pace. Recently, it has
become clear that the provisions of Section IV.L need to be re-examined in a
comprehensive manner to address these advances. The Board of Selectmen, in
recognition of this, is committed to establishing a committee with the necessary expertise
to analyze the current and projected future technology and to make comprehensive
recommendations for regulating these facilities in compliance with the
Telecommunications Act
By enacting a temporary, six month moratorium, the Town will have time to develop
reasonable regulations regarding the placement, construction and modification of wireless
communications facilities. The Town fully recognizes its responsibilities under the
Telecommunications Act of 1996. Full and impartial compliance with the Act is best
accomplished through thoughtful analysis and subsequent regulatory guidance. 
Therefore, in reliance on the Town‟s authority under General Laws chapter 40A and the
Massachusetts State Constitution, and in keeping with the Town‟s responsibilities to
protect public health, welfare, and safety, the Town hereby adopts this temporary
moratorium.

ARTICLE 36 (CONTINUED)
2. Temporary Moratorium
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Zoning By-law to the contrary, for a period
of six months from the effective date of this amendment, no building permit, special
permit, or variance shall be issued for the construction, placement, installation, 
modification, alteration, or use of any building, structure, or land within the town for the
purpose of a wireless communications facility, as defined in Section IV.L this By-law, 
within the town. Amateur radio towers, to the extent they are exempt from Zoning By-
law requirements under General Laws chapter 40A §3, and wireless communication
facilities for use by police, fire, or other emergency services are exempt from this
moratorium. 
Pass any vote or any action relative thereto. 
Sponsor: Board of Selectmen
May 6, 2010 Voted: That the Zoning Bylaw be amended by adding a new Section I.F.
