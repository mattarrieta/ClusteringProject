ARTICLE 25 RESOLUTION 
WHEREAS, Global warming, caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels and resulting
increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is a serious threat to current and future
generations in Framingham and around the world; and
WHEREAS, Global warming is already causing costly disruption of human and natural systems
throughout the world, including the acidification of the oceans, melting of Arctic and glacial ice, 
rising sea levels, increasing heat waves, floods, drought, extreme weather, and corresponding
food and water shortages, property damage, loss of biodiversity, and death; and
WHEREAS, The effects of global warming will further intensify with increased temperatures
such that almost all governments in the world, including the United States, have agreed (through
the 2009 Copenhagen Accord) that any warming above a 2°C (3.6°F) rise would be unsafe for
human habitation; and
WHEREAS, Scientists estimate that humans can emit only approximately 565 more gigatons of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and still retain a reasonable hope of not exceeding 2°C of
global warming; and
WHEREAS, Proven coal, oil and gas reserves counted as assets of fossil fuel companies equal
roughly 2,795 gigatons of CO2, or five times the maximum amount that can safely be released to
prevent more than 2°C of global warming; and
WHEREAS, Fossil fuel companies continue to explore for even more fossil fuel deposits that
cannot be burned without rendering Earth unfit for human habitation; and
WHEREAS, Fossil fuel companies operate under the imperative to create shareholder profit
rather than for long term public benefit, use their considerable financial resources to mislead the
public on the scientific consensus about the dangers of global warming, and to influence the
government to maintain laws and regulations favorable to the continuing sale of their product, 
and
WHEREAS, The Town of Framingham has a moral duty to protect the lives and livelihoods of
its inhabitants and of people around the world from the threat of global warming and believes
that its investments should support a future without the catastrophic impacts of a warming
environment; and
WHEREAS, The Town of Framingham has a duty to its employees and taxpayers to maintain the
value of funds invested on their behalf and to avoid risky investments; and 
Page 48

Annual Town Meeting
April 29, 2014
ARTICLE 25 RESOLUTION CONTINUED 
WHEREAS, Investments in fossil fuel companies could prove highly risky given that 80% of
their proven reserves could become "stranded" and unusable assets if governments act to protect
a habitable climate; now
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT Framingham Town Meeting urges its Retirement
Board and Town Treasurer to review their investment portfolios in order to identify any holdings
that include direct or indirect investments in Fossil Fuel Companies, defined for purposes of this
Resolution as any of the two hundred publicly-traded companies with the largest coal, oil and gas
reserves (as measured by the gigatons of carbon dioxide that would be emitted if those reserves
were extracted and burned) such as those companies listed in the Carbon Tracker Initiative's
"Unburnable Carbon" report; and
Be it FURTHER RESOLVED, That Framingham Town Meeting urges it Retirement Board and
the Town Treasurer to adopt policies to divest from such existing public equities, corporate
bonds, or other direct holdings in Fossil Fuel Companies within five years and to preclude any
new direct investments in Fossil Fuel Companies in the future, and
Be it FURTHER RESOLVED, That, for any investments of the Town of Framingham in
commingled funds that are found to include Fossil Fuel Companies, Town Meeting urges the
Retirement Board and Town Treasurer to contact the fund managers and request that the Fossil
Fuel Companies be removed from such funds; and
Be it FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Town Treasurer and Retirement Board release annual
updates, that are made available to the public, which detail progress made towards full
divestment in Fossil Fuel Companies within five years; and
Be it FURTHER RESOLVED, That Town Meeting urges the Board of Selectmen, Town
Treasurer and Retirement Board to endorse proposed state legislation requiring divestment of
statewide retirement funds (Pension Reserve Investment Trust (PRIT)) from fossil fuel
companies, and
Be it FURTHER RESOLVED, That the Town Clerk is requested to send copies of this
Resolution to Governor Deval Patrick, State Treasurer Steven Grossman, State Senator Michael
Barrett, and State Representative Cory Atkins, or take any other action relative thereto. 
Sponsor: Citizens’ Petition (Kenneth Weiss)
May 15, 2014 Voted: That the Town enact the resolution on Fossil Fuel Divestment as

IV.S. Agricultural Preservation Development 
1. Purpose and Intent
The Agricultural Preservation Development (APD) By-law shall apply to parcels of land within the
Town of Framingham that meet the definition of an Active Farm. The APD provides landowners with
an opportunity to sell up to 30 percent of their land for a residential cluster development while
protecting a minimum of 70 percent of the property as an Active Farm Parcel. 
The intent of the APD is to: 
a. Promote and protect the Active Farm through conservation of those lands for future agricultural
use and/or habitat: 
b. Maintain an adequate base of agricultural land and activity in Framingham to help ensure the
continued economic viability of local farms and thereby contributing to the continued
availability of agricultural supported services; 
c. Preserve land which, by virtue of its soil composition, acreage, location adjacent to and
contiguous with other farmland or preserved open space forming discrete blocks of land, and its
lack of protection under existing zoning or other laws, comprises the critical unprotected
farmland of the Town of Framingham. 
d. Create a unique cluster development neighborhood setting while preserving important farming
resources; 
e. Establish non-motorized vehicular connections between open space parcels, water resources, 
neighborhoods, and/or public amenities; and

ARTICLE 44 ATTACHMENT 
H. FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS 
1. Establishment of Districts 
The Floodplain District is herein established as an overlay district. The District includes all special
flood hazard areas within the Town of Framingham designated as Zone A and AE on the
Middlesex County Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) issued by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) for the administration of the National Flood Insurance Program. 
The map panels of the Middlesex County FIRM that are wholly or partially within the Town of
Framingham are panel numbers 25017C0501F , 25017C0502F , 25017C0503F , 25017C0504F, 
25017C0506F, 25017C0508F, 25017C0509F, 25017C0511F, 25017C0512F, 25017C0514F, 
25017C0516F, 25017C0517F, 25017C0518F, and 25017C0519F, dated July 7, 2014. The exact
boundaries of the District may be defined by the 100-year base flood elevations shown on the
FIRM and further defined by the Middlesex County Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report dated July
7, 2014. The FIRM and FIS report are incorporated herein by reference and are on file with the
Town Clerk, Town Engineer, Building Department, Planning Department, and Conservation
Commission. 
2. Applicability 
a. All proposed development in a Floodplain District shall require a permit from the Building
Commissioner. 
b. In addition to a permit from the Building Commissioner, any construction, enlargement, 
extension, or substantial improvement of a new or existing building for human habitation, 
normally allowed by right or authorized by special permit in a land area underlying a Floodplain
District, shall require a special permit from the Zoning Board of Appeals (ZBA).
c. In the regulatory floodway, any development or encroachment, including fill, which would
result in any increase in flood levels during the base flood shall be prohibited. In Zones A and AE, 
along watercourses that have not had a regulatory floodway designated, the best available Federal, 
State, local, or other floodway data shall be used to prohibit encroachments in floodways which
would result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge. 
d. Base flood elevation data is required for subdivision proposals or other developments greater
than 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is the lesser, within unnumbered A zones. All subdivision
proposals must be designed to assure that: 
(1) Such proposals minimize flood damage; 
(2) All public utilities and facilities are located and constructed to minimize or eliminate
flood damage; and 
(3) Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.

3. Application Procedure 
Prior to the filing of an application subject to this section, the applicant shall submit plans to the
Building Commissioner. The Commissioner shall advise the applicant as to the pertinent sections
of the Zoning By-Law and the State Building Code particularly Section 744 of such code which is
incorporated herein by reference. If a special permit is required, the applicant shall then submit
seven copies of the application to the ZBA, who shall forthwith transmit one copy each to the
Town Clerk, the Conservation Commission, the Board of Health, the Engineering Department, 
the Planning Department, and the Planning Board. Such agencies shall, within 30 days of
receiving said copy, submit a report containing recommendations and the reasons therefor to the
ZBA, and may prescribe conditions deemed appropriate for the proposed use. The ZBA shall not
render a decision on any such application until said recommendations have been received and
considered, or until the 30-day period has expired, whichever is earlier. Failure of such agencies
to submit their respective recommendations shall be deemed concurrence thereto. 
To assist the ZBA in rendering its decision on the application, said application shall indicate at
least the following: 
a. All information normally required in a building permit application. 
b. If approval for development must be obtained from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or
the United States Government or any agency or subdivision thereof, such approval shall be
obtained, and a copy of the document setting forth such approval, and any conditions imposed
thereon, shall be filed with the ZBA as part of this application. 
c. The boundary of the special flood hazard area and the regulatory floodway shall be drawn on a
plan of the site which shall also include contour lines at a maximum of two foot intervals. Base
flood elevation on this site plan shall be certified by a registered professional engineer, architect, 
or surveyor. In unnumbered A zones base flood elevation data from sources other than the FIRM
shall be obtained and reasonably utilized. 
d. Location of existing and proposed sewer disposal facilities, leaching fields, and other utilities. 
e. For any building to be occupied as a residence, certification by a registered professional
engineer, architect, or surveyor that the proposed structure has been planned and designed to have
the lowest floor, including the basement, elevated above the level of the base flood. 
f. For any building not to be occupied as a residence, either certification as above that the lowest
floor will be elevated above the level of the base flood, or certification by a registered
professional engineer or architect that the building is planned and designed so that it will be
watertight and anchored to resist forces associated with the base flood. 
g. Other information as may reasonably be required by the ZBA to ensure compliance with the
provisions of this section. 
4. Conditions for Approval 
Page 91
Town of Framingham
Annual Town Meeting
April 29, 2014
In rendering its decision, the ZBA shall evaluate the extent to which the application meets the
following conditions: 
a. All other necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which
approval is required by Federal or State Law. 
b. New construction (including prefabricated buildings and mobile homes) and substantial
improvements will be anchored to prevent flotation and lateral movement, and will be constructed
with flood-resistant materials and methods. 
c. Proposed development, including utilities, drainage, and paved areas, is located and designed to
be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
d. The site plan includes all required information, including base flood elevation data. 
e. New water and sewer systems (including on-site systems) are located and designed to minimize
infiltration. 
f. New and substantially improved residential buildings have been planned and designed to have
the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level. 
g. New and substantially improved non-residential buildings have been planned and designed to
have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level; or be
floodproofed to or above that level. 
h. Where floodproofing is used in lieu of elevation, the floodproofing methods used are adequate
to withstand the forces associated with the base flood. 
i. Proposed development will not encroach on the regulatory floodway. 
5. Occupancy Permit 
No building newly constructed or substantially improved within a Floodplain District shall be
occupied or used without an occupancy permit signed by the Building Commissioner which permit
shall not be issued until the development complies in all respects with the site plan approved by the
ZBA and any conditions imposed by the ZBA on the granting of a special permit for development in a
Floodplain District. No occupancy permit shall be signed by the Building Commissioner until a Post
Construction Elevation Certificate/Flood proofing Certificate has been submitted certifying that the
building has been elevated above the level of the base flood or, for non-residential buildings, that the
building has been floodproofed at least to the base flood elevation. In cases where a variance has been
granted by the ZBA permitting construction below the base flood level and/or without adequate
floodproofing, an occupancy permit may be granted in accordance with the conditions imposed by the
ZBA on the granting of a variance. 
6. Notification of Watercourse Alteration
