Harold Geller, Precinct 2
Standing Committee of Ways and Means Chair
_______________________________________________________________________________________
April 26, 2016 Failed: I move that the Town deny funding to all Adult English as a Second Language (ESL) 
programs being subsidized by HUD CDBG money, which is specified in section 4.0 Public services of the
CDBG budget request for their lack of oversight and verification of who can legally partake of their programs. 
The money from the reclaimed 35,357.00 is to be divided up equally and sent to the remaining programs in
section 4.0. That would be an extra 7071.40 for each of the remaining programs five programs. 
4.3  Framingham Coalition Community Connections
4.4  Pearl Street Cupboard

2) Furthermore, we Framingham Town Meeting Members also require that the legal status of any and all
participants in said Adult ESL programs be verified as to their Framingham residency and their legal
immigration status before any funds in the future are to be allocated to any of the Framingham Adult School
or Town sponsored ESL programs. Since this procedure has not been accomplished in the past, the participants
of undetermined status have failed to meet the requirements for this funding. I propose that they and and all
other town sponsored Adult ESL programs be denied receipt of said funds for the rest of 2016 and 2017 and
then indefinitely, if residency and legal immigration status is not met and verified from a bonafide govt. based
program and that these most-needed funds be reallocated to other much-needed programs in town.

To see if the Town will vote to amend the Town Bylaws by adding a PLASTIC BAG REDUCTION
BYLAW. 
Motion: I Move to amend the bylaws by adding Section 8 Plastic Bag Reduction Bylaw to article VIII as
follows: 
8.1 Purpose and Intent
The production and use of thin-film single-use plastic checkout bags have significant impacts on
the environment, including, but not limited to: contributing to the potential death of marine animals
through ingestion and entanglement; contributing to pollution of the land environment; creating a
burden to solid waste collection and recycling facilities; clogging storm drainage systems; and
requiring the use of millions of barrels of crude oil nationally for their manufacture. 
The purpose of this bylaw is to eliminate the usage of thin-film single-use plastic bags by all retail
and grocery stores in the Town of Framingham, on or after January 1, 2017. 
8.2 Definitions
8.2.1 Checkout bag: A carryout bag provided by a store to a customer at the point of sale. Checkout
bags shall not include bags, whether plastic or not, in which loose produce or products are placed
by the consumer to deliver such items to the point of sale or checkout area of the store. 
8.2.2 Grocery Store: A retail establishment where more than fifty percent (50%) of the gross floor
area is devoted to the sale of food products for home preparation and consumption, which typically
also offers home care and personal care products. 
8.2.3 Retail Store: An establishment that offers the sale and display of merchandise within a
building. 
8.2.4 Reusable checkout bag: A bag, with handles, that is specifically designed for multiple use
and is made of thick plastic, cloth, fabric or other durable materials. 
8.2.5 Thin-film single-use plastic bags: Typically with plastic handles, these are bags with a
thickness of 2.5 mils or less and are intended for single-use transport of purchased products. 
8.3 Use Regulations
8.3.1 Thin-film single-use plastic bags shall not be distributed, used, or sold for checkout or other
purposes at any retail or grocery store within the Town of Concord. 
8.3.2 Customers are encouraged to bring their own reusable or biodegradable shopping bags to
stores. Retail or grocery stores are strongly encouraged to make reusable checkout bags available
for sale to customers at a reasonable price. 
8.3.3 Thin-film plastic bags used to contain dry cleaning, newspapers, produce, meat, bulk foods, 
wet items and other similar merchandise, typically without handles, are still permissible. 
8.4. Enforcement Process
Enforcement of this bylaw shall be the responsibility of the Town Manager or his/her designee. 
The Town Manager shall determine the inspection process to be followed, incorporating the process
Page 81

into other town duties as appropriate. Any retail or grocery store distributing plastic grocery bags
in violation of this bylaw shall be subject to a non-criminal disposition fine as specified in Appendix
A of the Regulations for Enforcement of Town Bylaws under M.G.L. Chapter 40, §21D. Any such
