ARTICLE 4 RESOLUTION A
May 1, 2013 Passed: CDBG funds include funding for an Adult ESL course which is in very high
demand. Such demand has led to a significant waiting list to get into the course. The registration
form asks the applicant if they are a U.S. citizen and if they are a legal resident alien. However, no
proof of such is requested nor is a signature testifying that the information provided is true. 
Be it resolved that the SCW&M requests that the town administration set a policy which would
require verification of legal status with appropriate documentation at the time of enrollment in this
program.

ARTICLE 18 RESOLUTION A
May 7, 2013 Failed: Be it resolved that for purpose of equitable sharing of the costs of operating
Loring Arena, the Town of Framingham will charge a rate that is at least 50% higher than the
resident rate for arena rentals to groups where fewer than half of the participants are town residents. 
For this purpose, dormitory room address will not be considered establishment of residency. 
Be it further resolved that the Park and Recreation Department will review use of the Arena with the
goal of allowing the general public ice skating time mid-week during late afternoon (after 5pm) and
evening hours, as well as providing skating instruction for the population older than the current 10-
year-old age limit. Thought should be given to keeping the arena open beyond hockey season
during the months of April and May, with the possibility of offering skating lessons during April
school vacation.

ARTICLE 42 - ATTACHMENT 
This Amendment is made as of the 9th day of May, 2013, by and between Danforth Green, LLC, 
a Massachusetts limited liability company, with a place of business at 21 Center Street, Weston, 
MA 02493, (hereinafter sometimes referred to as “Developer”) and the Town of Framingham, a
municipal corporation organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with a
place of business at 150 Concord Street, Framingham, MA 01702 (hereinafter referred to as the
“Town”), to that certain Agreement dated March 19, 2003 by and between the Town and
National Development Associates of New England, Inc.; New England Sand & Gravel Co., Inc.;
and Riverpath Associates Limited Partnership (hereinafter referred to as the “Access
Agreement”).
WHEREAS, Danforth Green, LLC is the owner of certain land in Framingham, Middlesex
County, Massachusetts more particularly described in Exhibit A attached to the Access
Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the “Property”); and 
WHEREAS, Danforth Green, LLC is the successor in interest to National Development
Associates of New England, Inc., New England Sand & Gravel Co., Inc. and Riverpath
Associates Limited Partnership, including all rights and obligations pursuant to the Access
Agreement; and
WHEREAS, in 2003 the Framingham Planning Board issued a special permit to allow for a
planned unit development (PUD) of up to 665 housing units on the Property; and 
WHEREAS, Danforth Green, LLC has since acquired the Property, and in 2012 submitted an
application to the Planning Board for Definitive Development Plan approval for the Property, as
required by Section III.J of the Town’s Zoning By-laws; and 
WHEREAS, on May 2, 2013, the Planning Board filed with the Town Clerk its Decision (the
“2013 Planning Board Decision”) with respect to the Definitive Development Plan, approving
the development of 173 for sale housing units and 180 rental housing units (the “Revised
Project”); and
WHEREAS, Danforth Green, LLC requested that the parties review and amend certain
provisions of the Access Agreement in light of the reduced number of units contained in the
2013 Definitive Development Plan as compared to the number of units allowed by the 2003
Special Permit; 
NOW, THEREFORE, Danforth Green, LLC and the Town, for good and valuable consideration, 
the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, hereby agree to amend the Access Agreement
upon the terms and conditions set forth herein. Except as expressly provided by this Amendment, 
all terms and conditions of the Access Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. 
Page 78
Town of Framingham
Annual Town Meeting
May 1, 2013
1.  This Amendment is subject to approval by the Framingham Town Meeting. In the event
that the Framingham 2013 Annual Town Meeting does not approve this Amendment, then this
Amendment shall be null and void and of no effect. 
2.  The first paragraph of the Access Agreement shall be amended by adding the following at
the end of the paragraph: “Danforth Green, LLC is the successor in interest to National
Development Associates of New England, Inc., New England Sand & Gravel Co., Inc. and
Riverpath Associates Limited Partnership, and is bound by this Agreement as provided in
Section 9 hereof. The rights and obligations set forth in this Agreement with respect to
Developer, Owner, Riverpath LP and NES&G shall all be deemed to be the rights and
obligations of Danforth Green, LLC, and its successors and assigns as provided in Section 9.”
3.  Section 1(d) of the Access Agreement shall be stricken in its entirety and replaced with
the following new Section 1(d):
(d) Definitive Development Plan and Final Installment. In 2013 Developer obtained approval of
the Planning Board for the Definitive Development Plan allowing for the development of 173 for
sale housing units and 180 rental housing units. Separate, apart and in addition to the First
Installment (which previously was paid by a predecessor of Developer), Developer shall pay to
the General Fund of the Town, by bank or certified check, the sum of $1,000,000 (the “Final
Installment”).  Of this amount, $500,000 shall be paid sixty days after issuance by the Town of
the first building permit for any building located on the Property (the “Commencement
Payment”). If there are any appeals of a decision by a town board or committee with respect to
the permitting of the Project which are not finally resolved in favor of Developer (it being agreed
that an outcome which enables Developer to proceed with the PUD Project in any fashion, 
whether or not in accord with the plans approved by the Planning Board, shall be deemed an
outcome in favor of Developer should the Developer elect to proceed with the PUD Project),
then the Developer shall have no obligation to pay the Final Installment and this Agreement shall
terminate on the 90th day following the entry of a final judgment resolving such appeal(s) in a
manner not favorable to the Developer, unless the Developer shall within such ninety day period
pay the first half of the Final Installment. The second half of the Final Installment, $500,000, 
shall be paid 180 days after the Commencement Payment is due. Interest shall accrue as of the
due date of the payments due hereunder in the event that either or both of the required payments
are not paid to the Town on or before the date specified herein, at the rate of four percent (4%)
compounded annually until the Final Installment and any such interest is paid. 
On or before the deadline for the payment of the Commencement Payment to the Town, 
Developer shall convey to the Town of Framingham, by quitclaim deed, good, clear, record and
marketable fee title (which shall be free of any mortgages, contractor liens or judgment liens, but
otherwise subject to all matters of record) to that portion of the Property which is located to the
north of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) Aqueduct, consisting of
Page 79

Annual Town Meeting

approximately 88 acres and shown on the plan attached hereto as Exhibit A (hereinafter referred
to as the “Town Parcel”), and also a permanent easement over certain roads in the PUD Project
and the MWRA Aqueduct to provide vehicular and pedestrian access to and egress from the
Town Parcel. Prior to conveying the Town Parcel and easement to the Town, Developer, at no
cost to the Town, shall: (1) within sixty days of the date of this Amendment, provide information
and conduct studies needed to satisfy the Town that the Town Parcel meets or exceeds all
requirements under M.G.L. c. 21E and other environmental statutes, including the submission of
a Phase I report, in accordance with ASTM Standards and that the Town Parcel does not present
an environmental hazard or risk to the Town or its residents; (2) remove all buildings, debris, 
stockpiles, oil drums, building materials, junk, abandoned utility systems, and automobiles and
automobile parts from the Town Parcel; and (3) thirty days after the receipt of all necessary
approvals by Town boards to regrade and restore the area outlined in red on the aerial
photograph attached hereto as Exhibit B which has been disturbed by excavation and other
activities to more natural contours with no grade in excess of fifteen degrees. It shall be the
Developer’s sole cost and responsibility to diligently pursue and obtain any necessary permits
and approvals for such regrading and restoration, and all such regrading and restoration on the
Town Parcel shall be conducted in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and Town laws, 
by-laws, and regulations at the sole cost and expense of Developer. The Town, in its absolute
and sole discretion, may decline to accept conveyance of the Town Parcel as provided herein and
so notify Developer not less than sixty days after receipt of the Phase I environmental site
assessment. If the Town declines to accept conveyance of the Town Parcel, Developer shall on
or before the deadline for the payment of the Commencement Payment to the Town, grant a
conservation restriction over the Town Parcel to the Town, or such other nonprofit entity as the
Town may designate, substantially in the form as provided in the Massachusetts Department of
Energy and Environmental Affairs model conservation restriction, which shall be approved by
the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs and provide that the Town Parcel shall be
preserved as open space in perpetuity, with rights of public access for passive recreation; along
with a permanent easement over certain roads in the PUD Project and the MWRA Aqueduct to
provide vehicular and pedestrian access to and egress from the Town Parcel
If the Developer does not pay the Commencement Payment or convey the Town Parcel as
provided herein, the parties hereto agree that, upon prior notice to Developer and an opportunity
for Developer to cure of not less than twenty days following such notice, the Lease shall not
terminate and the PUD Project to which this Agreement pertains shall not be constructed. If the
Developer fails to pay the Final Payment on the due date thereof, then, in addition to the other
remedies available to the Town set forth herein, the Developer shall cease all construction
activities on the Revised Project within five (5) days, and no further construction activities shall
be undertaken and no certificate(s) of occupancy issued for any unit on the Revised Project until
such time as the Final Installment plus applicable interest is paid. 
Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of the Town’s regulatory authority (and
where the applicable law or statute permits discretion in acting on any such application, good

faith discretion) pursuant to its ordinary permit-granting and police powers in compliance with

ARTICLE 54 - ATTACHMENT 
SECTION III.Q. INTERIM MEDICAL MARIJUANA TREATMENT CENTER MORATORIUM 
1. Purpose and Intent.
The purpose of this By-law is intended to provide restrictions that will allow the Town of
Framingham adequate time to consider whether to allow facilities associated with the
medical use of marijuana, to the extent that such facilities are permitted under state laws
and regulations, and, if so, where and under what conditions. A law permitting the
medical use of marijuana in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts became effective on
January 1, 2013; however, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has yet to
promulgate the regulations by which facilities that produce or dispense medical
marijuana shall be registered and administered. A restriction on the establishment of such
facilities in Framingham shall provide the opportunity to study their potential impacts on
adjacent uses and on general public health, safety and welfare, and to develop zoning and
other applicable regulations that appropriately address these considerations consistent
with statewide regulations and permitting procedures. 
2. Definitions
Medical Marijuana Treatment Center (MMTC) shall mean any medical marijuana
treatment center, as defined under state law, as a not-for-profit entity, as defined by
Massachusetts law only, that acquires, cultivates, possesses, processes (including
development of related products such as food, tinctures, aerosols, oils, or ointments),
transfers, transports, sells, distributes, dispenses, or administers marijuana, products
containing marijuana, related supplies or educational materials to qualifying patients or
their personal caregivers, which is properly licensed and registered by the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health pursuant to all applicable state laws and regulations. 
3. Exclusion of Other Marijuana Uses
Any establishment that acquires, cultivates, possess, processes (including development of
related products such as food, tincture, aerosols, oils, or ointments), transfer, transports, 
sells, distributes, dispenses, or administer marijuana, products containing marijuana, 
related supplies, or educational materials to qualifying patients or their personal
caregivers, shall not be permitted if such establishment has not been properly registered
an licensed in accordance with applicable state and local laws and regulations, or is not
operated as a not-for-profit entity, or otherwise fails to meet the definitions of a Medical
Marijuana Treatment Center. 
4. Exclusion of Accessory Uses
Page 121
Town of Framingham
Annual Town Meeting
May 1, 2013
In no case shall the acquisition, cultivation, possession, processing, transference, 
transportation, sale, distribution, dispensing, or administration of marijuana, products
containing or derived for marijuana, or related products be considered accessory to any
use. 
5. Interim Restriction
Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers shall not be permitted in any zoning district in the
Town of Framingham so long as this By-law is effective, as set forth in Section III.Q.6.,
herein. Use variances shall be strictly prohibited. 
6. Expiration
This Section shall be effective until June 30, 2014, or until such earlier time that the
Town Meeting enacts superseding zoning regulations. Amended superseding zoning
regulations shall set forth the allowed locations, dimensional, parking and other
requirements applicable to medical marijuana uses.
