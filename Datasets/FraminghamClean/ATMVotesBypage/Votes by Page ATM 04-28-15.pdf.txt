Youth in low-income areas are particularly prone to health issues related to lack of exercise due to the
expense of equipment and travel, or lack of leisure time. For these communities a local skatepark is an
effective tool that teaches healthy, athletic living. Skateboarding is physically active and requires, at
times, great concentration. It encourages children to spend time outdoors, test their endurance, sharpen
their senses and develop their creativity. Skateparks provide a place for local youth to meet, socialize and
develop friendships based on a common, healthy interest.

contiguous parcels in one ownership throughout, or any combination of parcels of land consolidated under a joint

to allow for the preservation of a Developable Farm and/or Developable Open Space Parcel and to increase development
potential upon the Receiving Parcels. The Transfer of Development Rights is allowed by a special permit from the Planning
Board. 
Peer Review Consultant: A person who is not a Town employee who shall assist the Planning Board and/or Zoning Board
of Appeals, in plan review, impact analysis, inspection or other technical or legal assistance necessary to ensure compliance
with all relevant laws and regulations. Such consultants shall be selected and retained by the Planning Board and/or Zoning
Board of Appeals, with the actual and reasonable cost for their services to be paid by the applicant. 
Transfer of Development Rights Yield Plan (TDR Yield Plan): A conceptual site plan developed by a certified
professional engineer and/or land surveyor licensed in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that demonstrates the extent of
development that could occur by-right on the Giving Parcel. The TDR Yield Plan shall identify all non-buildable areas, 
which include wetlands, wetland buffers, and Moderate Slopes, and deem this area as non-buildable; non-buildable areas
shall not be considered as part of the developable area. 
SECTION V.O. Transfer of Development Rights
1. Purpose 
The purpose of the Transfer of Development Right (TDR) By-law is to provide an alternative for
the preservation of Developable Farm and/or Developable Open Space Parcels; while
encouraging economic development through an increase in the development potential within
designated parcels. Through a TDR special permit a Developable Farm and/or Developable Open
Space Parcel can sell its potential Development Rights to a Receiving Parcel; thereby allowing
the Receiving Parcel to meet its companies’ growth demands. The objective of the TDR is
twofold: to serve as an economic development tool while promoting the preservation of
Developable Farm and/or Developable Open Space parcel in exchange. The intent of the TDR
special permit is consistent with the goals and objectives of the Town’s Master Land Use Plan
and Open Space & Recreation Plan. 
2. Applicability
a. The Giving Parcel
1. The Planning Board shall determine the allowable Development Rights that may be
transferred to a Receiving Parcel. To determine the total Development Rights allowed to
be transferred, the owner of the Giving Parcel shall prepare a Transfer of Development
Rights Yield Plan (TDR Yield Plan).
2. The owner of the Giving Parcel shall submit the TDR Yield Plan and an application to
the Planning Board for review. The Planning Board may retain a Peer Review Consultant
at the expense of the owner of the Giving Parcel to ensure the TDR Yield Plan represents
a true and accurate representation of the Giving Parcel. 
3. The TDR Yield Plan will be reviewed during a posted public hearing; notice of the public
hearing shall be made in accordance with G.L. c. 40A, §11. 
4. The total allowable Development Rights that the Giving Parcel is eligible to transfer shall
be the total square footage of the residential building allowed as denoted in the Transfer
of Development Rights Residential Building Size Chart within the specific zoning district that
the Giving Parcel is located in. The size of the residential building as denoted in the Transfer
of Development Rights Residential Building Size Chart shall be multiplied by the total
number of building lots allowed by-right to determine the total area to be transferred to a
Receiving Parcel and placed under an APR and/or CR.

pre-existing non-conforming property and a variance has not ever been issued from the
requirements of this Section V.O for the Receiving Parcel. A pre-existing non-conformity or a

ARTICLE 40 ATTACHMENT 
For some years the Government study committee has been operating at a maximum appointed level of 9
or fewer members, and the quorum has been defined in the committee rules as “a simple majority of
appointed meeting members, and no less than five.” The purpose of this article is to enact what has been
the de facto state of the committee: 9 appointed members with a quorum of 5. While changing the bylaw, 
it makes sense to add the officers that have become traditional for the committee. 
To enact these changes, the following modifications to the Town’s General Bylaws are required
(indicated by bold text that is formatted with either an underline or strikethrough):

ARTICLE 41 ATTACHMENT 
Under the current quorum requirements of the Real Property Committee, 60% of the appointed Town
Meeting Members need to be present, and it is possible to have 11 of the 16 members in attendance
without having a quorum. 
Considering the essential nature of the Real Property Committee’s work, and the potential challenge
posed by restricting the quorum to just Town Meeting Members, this proposal aims to loosen the
restriction without changing the intent of the requirement. The Government Study Committee
recommends the adoption of a new quorum of 7 appointed members, with at least 4 being Town Meeting
members. This will mean that 40% of the TMMs need to be present, and in a worst case scenario there
can be 9 of the 16 members in attendance without having a quorum. 
To enact this change, the following modifications to the Town’s General Bylaws are required (indicated
by bold text that is formatted with either an underline or strikethrough):
Article II Section 16.3
The Real Property Committee shall choose its own officers from the ten (10) Town Meeting
Members. A quorum of said committee shall be six seven (67), of the ten including at least four
(104) Town Meeting Members.
