PolicyDescription
I. THREECOMMONTYPESOFCONDUCTTHATMUSTBEAVOIDED
TheConflict ofInterest Law (“COIL”) isconcerned primarily withconduct whichmayaffectthe
ability ofpersons who are serving theTown asTown Employees torender such services with
undivided loyalty totheinterests oftheTown anditsresidents. Inaddition, thelawrequires such
persons tonot engage inconduct that could reasonably lead objective observers tobelieve that a
violation ofthelawmight occur, theso-called prohibition against “theappearance ofconflict.”
Insome situations conduct thatmight violate thelawcan bemade harmless bytheperson
making apublicdisclosure ofthecircumstances. Insomecasesthedisclosure aloneissufficient. 
Inother cases aperson holding anappointed position may receive permission toproceed inthe
matterafterdisclosure totheappointing authority. 
Ifaperson isuncertain whether the “COIL” applies toaproposed action, anopinion may be
obtainedfromTownCounselortheStateEthicsCommission. Afavorable opinionthatisbased
onanaccurate disclosure ofthecircumstances willprotect theperson against disciplinary action
bytheEthicsCommission andpossible criminal prosecution. 
Ifaviolation occurs, depending onitsnature andseverity, theperson maybesubject tocivilor
criminal penalties including finesandimprisonment. Inaddition, iftheviolation hasharmed the
financial interests oftheTown initsdealings with others, theaction taken inviolation ofthelaw
maybecancelled. 
The types ofconduct thatmost frequently arelikely toviolate the lawcanbesummarized as
follows: 
A) YOUMAYNOTRECEIVEPAYMENTFROMSOMEONEELSEORACT
FOR SOMEONE OTHER THAN THE TOWN INPERFORMING YOUR
DUTIES FORTHETOWN. 
Aperson subject tothe law may not receive orask for compensation from any person
otherthantheTowninconnection withtheperson’sperformance ofdutiesfortheTown. 
In plain terms, aperson may not accept or solicit abribe or agift, or be paid by anyone
other than the Town forparticipating inone’sofficial duties fortheTown. Similarly, a
personsubjecttothelawmaynotactforanyoneotherthanthe Towninanymatterin
which theTownisaparty orhasadirectorsubstantial interest, whether ornottheperson
has any official responsibility in connection with the matter. (C. 268A, Sec.17) 
B) YOUMAYNOTACTFORTHETOWNINAMATTERINWHICHAYOU

ATown Employee may not act forthe Town inany matter inwhich theperson hasa
financial interest. (C. 268A, Sec.19) 
YOU MAY NOT HAVE AFINANCIAL INTEREST INATOWN CONTRACT
ATown Employee may nothave afinancial interest inacontract made bytheTown even
iftheperson hadnoofficial responsibility inconnection withmaking thecontract. A
contract of employment between aTown Employee and the Town is permitted. (C. 268A, 
Sec. 20) 
C) YOUMAYNOTACTINAWAYTHATWOULDCAUSEAREASONABLE
PERSON WHO ISAWARE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO THINK YOU
COULD BEIMPROPERLY INFLUENCED OR SHOW FAVORITISM IN
PERFORMING YOUR DUTIES ASTHE RESULT OF FAMILY
RELATIONSHIPS ORUNDUE INFLUENCE OFANOTHER PERSON. C. 
268A, Sec. 23(b)(3).
ATown Employee may violate thissection even iftheemployee’sconduct does not
amount toanactual violation ofanother section. Thissection cautions against acting ina
way thatwould giveareasonable person, notonewhoisunduly suspicious ordistrustful
of anyone in public office, reason to conclude from the way you act, or from your
relationship tosomeone having aninterest intheoutcome ofyourofficial actions, that
your performance could betheresult ofimproper influence orfamily, business or
professional relationships. 
The three types ofconduct summarized above arenottheonly provisions ofthe lawwith which
the “COIL” and this policy are concerned. They are, however, among the most common sources
ofdifficulty andarebasictoanunderstanding ofthelaw. 
II.  SPECIAL TOWN EMPLOYEES
TheCOIL authorizes theBoard ofSelectmen initsdiscretion todesignate certain Town
Employees (otherthanSelectmen) asSpecial TownEmployees. Special TownEmployees may
beexempt from certain provisions oftheCOIL depending onthenature oftheresponsibilities of
theirposition. Ifanymember ofaboard orcommittee receives thedesignation allmustreceive
it. The COIL establishes minimum requirements for eligibility that include unpaid volunteers and
certainparttimepaidTownEmployees. TheBoardofSelectmen hasnotdesignated anyposition
asaSpecial TownEmployee, butmaydosoinappropriate circumstances inparticular cases.
