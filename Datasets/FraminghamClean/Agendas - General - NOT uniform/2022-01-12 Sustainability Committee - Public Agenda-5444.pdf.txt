ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 
We owe a debt of gratitude to many people for their support and encouragement on this project. 
Rep. Brownsberger spent many hours with us not only discussing the policy concepts but also
orienting us to geography and politics of Belmont. Jay Szklut, Belmont Director of Planning and
Economic Development, and Jennifer Fallon, Chair of the Belmont Planning Board, were both
generous with their time and provided many important insights and cautions. Barbara Miranda
helped organize the focus group, bringing together an unlikely gathering of town residents. 
Roger Colton gave us great feedback and encouragement when our spirits were low. Christian
Jacqz at MassGIS and Richard Simmons Jr., Belmont town assessor, helped us to wade through
complex data sets with patience and thoughtful attention to our requests for information. We
would have little to report without their help. 
Special thanks to David Luberoff of the Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston for his
enthusiasm and many hours of support as our advisor. David offered detailed, thorough, and
insightful feedback throughout the project. He gave constructive critiques when we failed to
address important aspects of this study and encouragement when our energies flagged. His
advice as we journeyed from basic idea to completed paper was invaluable. We also are indebted
to Julie Wilson for all of her help designing our research, and we are grateful for Bill Apgar’s
counsel and watchfulness during the conception of this partnership. His acute questions and
process suggestions made our subsequent efforts more productive. Though only tangentially
connected to this effort, we would be remiss not to thank Alan Altshuler. His course on the
politics of urban planning and development, served to inspire our curiosity and interest in the
topic of this study. 
Last, but certainly not least, we thank Kate and Sara for their patience, support, and
understanding. The long hours we spent on this project would have been that much more
challenging without their love to return home to.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This policy analysis was conducted at the behest of Massachusetts State Representative William
Brownsberger (Belmont), who is searching for ways to reduce the state’s greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions while also encouraging the development of affordable housing. This report explores a
housing policy concept, the “green” density bonus, as a means for achieving those goals. 
In Massachusetts, the majority of GHG emissions are directly related to the type and location of
residential housing. In addition, Greater Boston is currently one of the least affordable
metropolitan areas in the United States. As of 2006, households earning the communities median
income could afford a median priced single-family home in only 27 of the 148 municipalities in
Metropolitan Boston.1
As construction practices have a significant impact on both the GHG emissions and affordability
of residential housing, one way to reduce both GHG emissions and increase affordability is to
modify the policy incentives that shape those practices. A green density bonus aims to tackle
each of these problems by encouraging more environmentally friendly and energy efficient
construction practices while also relaxing restrictive zoning practices that constrain the region’s
housing supply. 
In this analysis we: 
  Examine existing green density bonus policies in eight localities. 
  Draw lessons from a focus group of Belmont, MA residents. 
  Present models examining the impact that various applications of the policy would have
on housing production and GHG emissions reductions if applied in Belmont, MA. 
  Evaluate green construction certification methods. 
  Present policy recommendations. 
How GHG Emissions and Residential Housing are Connected 
Page | 1 
Page 10
In Massachusetts, the residential housing sector accounts for 29% of end use GHG emissions.2
As concerns about climate change have become increasingly mainstream, so too have a series of
construction methods and practices aimed at reducing the environmental footprint of the built
environment. These “green” construction practices have resulted in significant improvements in
the energy efficiency of commercial and residential buildings. A “green” home can reduce
energy use by as much as 40%.3
How Density and Affordability are Connected
The factors that contribute to housing costs are multiple and very complex. However, there are
two ways in which density can have an impact on housing affordability. First, by increasing
allowable density, a locality can bring housing costs into closer alignment with marginal
construction costs.4 Second, by tapping into the greater development value created by increased
density allotments, a locality can require that a developer set aside a certain percentage of a
development for affordable housing. 
Summary of Case Studies
There is considerable variation in the existing green density bonus policies. Most offer a bonus
for commercial and residential developments requiring a site review. No communities have
implemented by-right bonuses and most are focused primarily on larger developments with little
to no focus on the single-family detached housing stock. Efforts to green single-family homes, 
like the policy examined in this report, have largely been implemented through mandates or
financial and other non-density related incentives. 
These case studies lack an easy transferability to the inner-ring suburban communities that are
the ultimate target of our evaluation. However, they do provide instructive lessons about the
process of achieving policy approval. Though it varied in each case, in general the process of
approval involved a long period of community engagement in which multiple interested parties
negotiated a feasible policy outcome. 
Summary of Modeling Impacts 
Page | 2 
Page 11
We examine five policy configurations for Belmont under both low and high growth
assumptions. Under the most conservative assumptions, the policy is likely to generate only 20
additional units in Belmont over a 20-year period. Under the most optimistic assumptions, the
policy could generate close to 600 additional units in Belmont. Likewise, the impact on GHG
emissions varies widely on the assumptions. The annual savings under low/moderate growth
assumptions after 20 years is therefore only 0.03% to 0.5% current emissions. In the best-case
scenario under the most optimistic growth assumptions, the policy reduces Belmont’s annual
GHG emissions by 2.4% after 20 years. 
Summary of Recommendations
If structured properly, a density bonus policy encouraging green residential construction would
be beneficial to the region and a worthwhile innovation. While the effects are likely to be small, 
especially if implemented in only one municipality, the policy could complement other efforts to
create more sustainable communities. 
We therefore offer the following recommendations: 
  Use USGBC’s LEED for Homes certification program with LEED Silver as the
minimum standard and tiered bonuses for Gold and Platinum
  Include location requirements (i.e. proximity to transit) to reduce impacts on VMT
  Levee a small per square foot fee to support affordable housing efforts in the state
If implemented in Belmont: 
  Structure bonus as an increase in allowable units, not FAR
  Target policy to larger minimum lot zones
  Convene a taskforce of diverse and respected community members to design and vet the
policy before proposing to the Town Meeting
If implemented at the state level: 
  For maximum impact: 
 Utilize a Chapter 40B framework as part of larger climate change legislation. 
Communities would qualify for green density bonus if they did not achieve
emission reductions targets. 
  For less impact, but higher political feasibility: 
Page | 3 
Page 12
 Utilize at Chapter 40R/40S framework that offers financial incentives to
municipalities that adopt green density bonus policies. 
  Establish a statewide coordinator to monitor the program and provide technical assistance

GREEN ZONING POLICY ANALYSIS 
CONTEXT AND PURPOSE 
Massachusetts State Representative William Brownsberger (Belmont) is considering ways in
which legislation to address land use patterns can help the state create more sustainable and
integrated communities. This paper explores what contribution a density bonus policy could
make towards reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and making housing more accessible
for working families. We will assess the potential impact that such a policy would have on the
community of Belmont, and by extension, we will consider implications for statewide
implementation. 
Increasing GHG emissions is threatening to dramatically alter the environments in which we
live. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has predicted that
without significant action to reduce emissions, major shifts in weather patterns and increasingly
frequent severe weather events will become more and more common.5 As of March 2009, no
national or statewide framework for pricing GHG emissions exists. Each year we continue our
current trends, we move closer to a scenario in which Massachusetts, along with other coastal
states, begins to lose real estate as rising sea levels encroach on currently inhabited lands.6
In Massachusetts, the residential sector accounts for nearly 30% of all end use GHG emissions. 
In addition to the large proportion of GHG emissions from the residential housing sector, 
transportation accounts for 32% of MA emissions.7 If the state is to reduce GHG emissions, it
will need to encourage less carbon intensive energy usage within households as well as promote
ways in which the location of housing can reduce vehicle miles travelled (VMT) and by
extension GHG emissions. 
States and localities have begun to address the energy intensity of buildings in both the
commercial and residential sectors by mandating, incentivizing, or otherwise encouraging 
Page | 5 
Page 14
developers to incorporate “green” building standards into their construction practices. One of the
more commonly used criteria for what constitutes “green” building is the US Green Building
Council’s (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program. LEED
and similarly green approved construction practices result in buildings with significant
reductions in energy use and GHG emissions. 
While the carbon content of fuel and fuel efficiency of cars have not changed significantly in the
past dozen years, VMT have increased dramatically. As might be expected, the amount of VMT
for any individual depends largely on how far that person lives from where he/she works and
whether alternative transportation modes are available and accessible. Concentrating residential
development near job centers and public transportation is one commonly proposed strategy for
counteracting this increase in VMT. 
GREEN ZONING - DENSITY BONUS POLICY 
In order to address the GHG emissions as well as other negative effects of a residential housing
stock that is both dispersed and inefficient, localities are exploring ways to encourage more
concentrated development as well as more efficient building practices. A policy that offers a
density bonus to developers in exchange for abiding by certain “green” building practices
endeavors to accomplish both of these goals. This “incentive Types of Density Bonuses
zoning” does so in an effort to achieve sustainable design goals
while incorporating various stakeholder concerns. In its simplest
terms, the policy is designed to encourage green building by
incentivizing developers to comply with LEED standards with
the promise of increasing the allowable density for a project. 
Allowable Units 
Floor Area Ratio8
Height Restrictions 
Minimum Lot Size 
The policy has three essential elements that bode well for its feasibility: 
1. It has low/negligible direct costs to the governing locality or state. Unlike tax abatements
and other incentives aimed at encouraging green construction, the density bonus imposes
Page | 6 
Page 15
only enforcement costs on the state. By incorporating the use of a third party (LEED) 
certifier, even these costs can be reduced to a manageable size. 
2. Developers want to build at higher density; increased density is very valuable to them. 
This simple fact makes the density bonus an attractive enticement, making the extra costs
of building to LEED standards worth the investment. 
3. Communities are increasingly aware of the need to reduce their GHG emissions. In a
show of support for aggressive action to reduce GHGs, Belmont recently passed a non-
binding resolution encouraging Rep. Brownsberger and the State to enact policies that
reduce emissions 80% by 2020.9
The policy also faces significant challenges, not the least of which is the traditionally strong
resistance of communities to relinquishing decisions about zoning policy. This is especially true
if a new policy will result in higher density. The challenges to the policy’s success will be: 
  From the community – concerns with costs, real and perceived, of increased density
  From developers – clarity about what level of density is needed to cover additional cost
of building green
This report evaluates this density bonus policy on two levels. First, we present an overview of
the expected impact that such a policy would have, taking into account various levels and types
of density bonus incentives. Second, we draw lessons from other localities who have instituted
similar density bonus policies to inform a political analysis of the barriers to successful
implementation. 
METHODOLOGY 
In order to answer our research questions, our methodology included both primary and secondary
research methods. We reviewed the relevant literature on incentive zoning, climate change and
community development patterns, and green housing practices. The focus of our secondary
research was to understand both the technical aspects of green building and the political realities
that contribute to suburban resistance to density. To supplement the literature, we interviewed
Page | 7 
Page 16
academic experts and professionals with expertise in urban planning and green design, and we
interviewed an array of community members and leaders in Belmont. 
While to the best of our knowledge no community has implemented the exact policy being
evaluated in this report, many communities throughout the United States have either
implemented density bonuses for LEED certified developments or have considered offering
density incentives. To highlight critical features and lessons from those communities, we
interviewed key actors in four communities. Those interviews along with details on six other
communities are summarized in the case study section below. 
Given the highly contentious nature of land use decisions in Massachusetts, we tested the
reaction and community sentiment toward the policy in a focus group of nine Belmont residents. 
The participants were invited and selected by Rep. Brownsberger to reflect his estimation of a
representative set of voices in Belmont. 
Finally, using the Belmont Assessor’s database of properties and the EIA’s Residential Energy
Consumption Survey, we construct a simple model to forecast possible policy outcomes. Based
on the model and information from the literature and interviews, we discuss the benefits and
costs of the policy from both the perspective of Belmont and the perspective of the entire
metropolitan area. These analyses are not intended to be exhaustive, but rather suggestive of key
themes and approximate magnitudes of impact. 
LAND-USE AND CLIMATE CHANGE 
A large and growing body of research suggests a strong and multifaceted connection between
land-use development patterns and GHG emissions. A pattern of sprawling development has led
to bigger houses on larger lots farther from city centers resulting in the loss of agricultural land, 
dramatic increases in traffic and distances traveled, and huge infrastructure burdens for
municipalities. Indeed nearly two thirds of Americans now live and work in the suburbs
surrounding cities.10 
Page | 8 
Page 17
In 2006, 61.5% of Massachusetts’s GHG
emissions came from transportation and the
heating, cooling and electricity used in
residential buildings—both categories influenced
by land-use decisions.11 
Recently Glaeser and Kahn attempted to
quantify the environmental externality of lower-
density development and sprawl. Assuming a
social cost of $43 per ton of CO2
, they estimate
the annual emissions social cost of an average home in a suburb of Boston is $200 more than that
of a home in Boston.12 
TRANSPORTATION AND LAND USE 
Since 1980 in the United States, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) have increased at three times the
rate of population growth, and according to Ewing et al. an estimated 52% of the increase in
VMT is attributable to changing development patterns (driving longer distances and switching
from walking and public transportation to private automobiles).13 Other factors include
population growth and declining rates of car pooling. 
Generally, there is an inverse relationship between density and VMT. Summarizing the findings
of an extensive literature review, Ewing et al. estimate the impact of increasing density as having
the potential to reduce per capita VMT 20% to 40%.14 However, Ruder cautions that VMT
elasticities are not constant and are sensitive to the starting density.15 Pickrell observes that the
effect of density on VMT only becomes significant at densities of 10,000 people per square mile
and above.16 However, others have found conflicting results to Pickrell and have asserted
significant effects at lower densities. 
Page | 9 
Page 18
Source: MassGIS17 
For example, Christian Jacqz of the Massachusetts GIS office recently conducted a study of
VMT and density in Massachusetts using vehicle registration data. Jacqz found a 15% reduction
in per capita VMT with a doubling of density.18 However, Jacqz’s study correlated VMT per
capita with more than just household density, including average destination distance, diversity of
land uses, distance to transit and income. All of the explanatory variables were significant.19 
Jazqz’s regression produces the following model, which explains approximately half of the
variation in household VMT: 
HH VMT = 85 – 0.9 Household_Density0.5 – 0.8 Job_Access0.2 – 0.58 Distance_to_Transit 
– 1.25 LU_Diversity + 5.6e-0.5 Household_Income + 14 Percent_Developed
Jacqz’s findings are consistent with Ruder, who argued that the location of density matters. 
Therefore, policies that increase density will reduce per capita VMT, but to have more 
Page | 10 
Page 19
significant impacts they should be targeted to areas with diverse land uses that are close to transit
and proximate to places of employment.

Although a lot of attention has recently been focused on increasing the efficiency of passenger
vehicles and finding lower carbon content fuels, the gains from these initiatives are unlikely to be
sufficient to the task of meeting reduction targets such as the non-binding resolution calling for
policies to reduce Massachusetts GHG emissions 80% by 2020 or even the state’s fair share of
the less aggressive IPCC recommendation of 80% worldwide reduction by 2050. As Ewing et al. 
observe, growth in VMT under current estimates will reduce the gains from efficiency
improvements. Without efforts to reduce VMT, the transportation sector will most likely miss
necessary targets for CO2 
emissions established by the IPCC.21 
Page | 11 
Page 20
DENSITY, HOUSING TYPE AND EFFICIENCY 
In addition to lower per capita VMT, denser development patterns are also associated with lower
per capita energy use. Single-family detached homes are the least energy efficient form of
housing both on total energy usage and on a per capita basis. Large apartment buildings (five or
more units) are the most efficient on average with single family attached homes and small
apartment buildings in between. 
Even without stricter green building standards, shifting toward attached single family homes and
apartment buildings could help reduce energy usage and strengthens the argument for Smart
Growth strategies. 
THE NEW SMART GROWTH 
In the final chapter of his book This Land, Anthony Flint outlines “Six Healthy Habits for
Sensible Growth,” one of which is to target redevelopment to inner ring suburbs.22 This strategy
is also reflected in the Metropolitan Area Planning Council’s Metro Future plan for the Greater
Boston Area, which explicitly states the goal that “population and job growth will be
concentrated in municipalities already well served by infrastructure, with slower growth in less
developed areas where infrastructure is more limited.”23 A density bonus policy could help to
Page | 12 
Page 21
complement other Smart Growth strategies by encouraging infill development, particularly in
close-in suburbs like Belmont. 
BUILDING “GREEN”
Since the late 1990s, states, cities, and municipalities have begun to adopt policies that
encourage the construction of environmentally friendly “green” buildings. While these efforts
were initially sporadic and limited to a few locations, there has been growing interest in building
green. While market forces have produced some increase in green construction practices, 
government intervention has been employed as a primary method for encouraging more stringent
green standards. 
There are several reasons cited in a recent EPA meeting to justify government intervention to
promote green construction methods. These align with reasons commonly justifications by
economists for market regulation. Primary among these are: 
  Market Failure – Environmental costs may not be internalized, thus requiring state
intervention to combat externalities. 
  Emergent Methods and Technologies – The methods and materials used in green
construction are new and may require government support to gain competitiveness. 
  Information flows – Many green construction practices are not widely known and
government should promote them. 
  Regional Public Good Agenda – Coordination may be needed across localities to
achieve regional development goals. 24 
As awareness of the threats posed by GHG emissions have increased, so too have policies aimed
at greening both commercial and residential construction practices. As stated above, the focus of
our analysis is on the strategy of providing density bonuses to encourage green construction. 
However, localities have used a variety of other policy tools to encourage green construction. A
Page | 13 
Page 22
review of the literature on green building incentives revealed a series of strategies, each with its
pros and cons. These are briefly reviewed below. 
Policy Tool
Mandates 
Details
Increasingly common for government buildings (schools, 
fire and police stations, etc), green mandates have yet to be
employed extensively to the private sector. Private sector
mandates are still treated with trepidation. Despite strong
evidence that achieving minimal green standards adds little
to construction costs, there is still resistance to using
mandates in the private sector, as the costs of going green
are still considered to be a barrier. 
Expedited permitting Creates a quicker process for projects that commit to
achieving green construction standards. This method is
often combined with others to create sufficient incentives. 
Downside: can strain capacity of local municipality’s
permitting division. 
Fee Waiver/Reduction Often coupled with expedited permitting, reduces or
eliminates construction, site plan, or other fees. Downside: 
Loss of revenue. 
Tax Break/Credit  Either reduces or eliminates property taxes for a specific
period of time for buildings that meet green standards. 
Downside: Loss of revenue. 
Grants  Gives cash grants to developments that comply with green
standards. Has disadvantage of costing the locality precious
funds. 
Free Consultation/Promotional
services/Technical Assistance 
When employing this method, governments grant free
consultative, technical, or promotional services for projects
that comply with green standards. Costs are not easily
calculated, but if used extensively, could add significantly
to municipal budget. 
Low Interest Loans  Cities provide special access to capital. Low cost, but also
implies increased risk taking on part of government. 
Page | 14 
Page 23
While these programs have all had some limited success, on their own, none is as attractive to
developers as the density bonus. In addition, while these policies may succeed in increasing the
construction of greener buildings, they do nothing to address the location of those buildings. 
GREEN BUILDINGS AND LEED
There has been growing demand for more environmentally friendly buildings and several
certification programs have been developed to advance the green building industry. Of the
available programs, the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental
Design (LEED) has become the most prominent in the United States.25 The LEED rating
program offers third party certification of a development’s green credentials using a four tier
rating system: Certified, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Although LEED started as a rating system
for new construction commercial buildings, they have expanded their programs and in 2007
released the LEED for Homes program. (The LEED for Homes checklist is included in
Appendix D)
LEED for Homes rates residential buildings on a number of features in eight categories: 
  Innovation & Design Process
  Location and Linkages
  Sustainable Sites
  Water Efficiency
  Energy and Atmosphere
  Indoor Environmental Air Quality
  Awareness and Education
According to the USGBC, green buildings can reduce: 26 
  Energy use by 22% to 40% 
  Water use 40% 
  Solid waste 70% 
Page | 15 
Page 24
These figures, which do not consider impacts on transportation, are consistent with other
research on the costs and benefits of LEED Certified buildings, which also show operating costs
savings of 45%.27 The studies also found that performance improved the higher the level of
LEED Certification. However, these studies examined commercial buildings and schools. We
could not find any comprehensive studies examining the costs and benefits of LEED Certified
single-family homes or small residential buildings, but case studies of individual projects suggest
similar benefits are achievable in small residential developments.28 
Many states and municipalities have started to mandate LEED Certification for government
buildings and commercial buildings over a certain size.29 One criticism of LEED has been the
cost and time to achieve certification and some have therefore suggested using LEED certifiable 
as the standard for incentive programs.30 
Some communities have also mandated the EPA’s Energy Star for Homes program for new
construction of single-family homes and other small residential buildings.31 Energy Star Rated
Homes are at least 15% more efficient than current codes.32 
Other U.S. certification programs are listed in APPENDIX C.
COSTS OF BUILDING GREEN 
The cost of building green largely depends on the method, technology and materials used in
construction. Often, building green is a tradeoff between higher construction and capital costs
and lower operating costs. This tradeoff has often inhibited green development as homebuyers
have not historically been well informed of the operating cost savings or may have high discount
rates. However, many now argue that significant energy savings can be achieved at little to no
cost with smart design of building envelopes and ventilations systems. Indeed, several
developers, architects and builders have demonstrated that energy savings of 50% or more
compared to current codes can be achieved without added construction costs.33 Other studies
have also shown little to no additional construction cost for LEED certified projects.34

Page 25
As the LEED program considers more than just energy efficiency, the cost of meeting LEED
standards may be more than zero. While the exact amounts will vary based on location and
specific products used, general cost figures for LEED are as follows: 
LEED Certification Level
Certified
Silver
Gold
Platinum 
Additional Cost per Square Foot35 
$0
$0-1
$1-3
$3-10
However, these cost estimates do not include the cost of certification ($0.035 - $0.045 per square
foot36), and commissioning and modeling, which combined can be sizeable ($20,000 - $100,000
for larger developments, but significantly less for residential units37).
Despite these additional costs, the credibility and comprehensive nature of the LEED program
for verifying the greenness of a building makes it an attractive partner for any government
seeking to green its built environment. 
DENSITY, GREEN AND AFFORDABILITY 
While the focus of this report is primarily on the environmental impacts of a density bonus
policy for green housing, the notion of a sustainable community also includes social and
financial indicators. As Glaeser, Schuetz and Ward and others have argued, land use regulations
in general increase housing prices,38 so theoretically a policy that eases restrictions will decrease
housing prices. 
The value of land can be a large factor in the overall cost of a housing unit. In 2004, the average
value of a buildable lot in the greater Boston area was approximately $390,000 per acre.39 
However, the value of a buildable lot in Belmont is close to $1.4 million per acre, but average lot
size is a quarter acre so the average land value per lot is more than $300,000.40 Assuming a
minimum dwelling unit size of 1,200 square feet and $100 construction cost per square foot, a
duplex could be built for $540,000 ($300,000 land + 2,400 sq. ft X $100 per sq. ft) excluding
soft costs. Each unit would therefore cost $270,000, which is approximately 6% less than the
Page | 17 
Page 26
average unit in a current duplex. Given that the soft costs of construction are likely to be high for
infill development those cost savings will likely evaporate. However, compared to a single-
family detached home built on the same lot, the cost of each unit is significantly lower. 
Therefore, one strategy to increase the affordability of housing is to encourage the development
of smaller units. Developers will build to the market and will likely build luxury units if there is
sufficient demand for high-end units. A key question is whether or not there is demand for
smaller units, and there is at least some evidence to that end. In a 2006 study, A.C. Nelson
estimated that the US housing supply compared to 2025 estimated demand was overbuilt for
large lot single-family homes and under built for both small lot and attached housing units.41 
However, to affect the overall cost of housing, a lot of units will need to be built (more than 10% 
of current supply).42 In order to particularize this general trend for Belmont and Massachusetts, 
we recommend further market studies about the demand for small lot and attached housing units
in both Belmont and other Metro Boston localities. 
INCENTIVE AND INCLUSIONARY ZONING 
Incentive zoning policies like density bonuses have been used for nearly 50 years as a rewards
system to encourage developers to meet specific urban planning goals. The reward levers vary
from tax breaks to financial assistance, but have their origins in the use of density bonus
schemes. After the rise of restrictive zoning early in the 20th century, the strategic relaxation of
zoning requirements became an important policy tool for municipalities to achieve small-scale
public amenity goals. 
In most states zoning policies are delegated to municipal level governments. During the 20th 
century, these localities enacted numerous policies, such as minimum lot size and construction
moratoriums, whose impact has been to discourage affordable housing construction. To
counteract these exclusionary zoning practices, many states and localities have begun to
intervene by changing zoning policies in order to correct for these past exclusionary practices. 
(See Appendix E for a longer discussion of incentive and inclusionary zoning) 
Page | 18 
Page 27
State level legislation has been used in numerous states to mandate or incentivize the production
of affordable housing units as well as produce other desirable statewide policy objectives. In
1969, Massachusetts enacted Chapter 40B whose principal aim was to counteract local
governments’ exclusionary zoning practices. The law created a consolidated state hearing
process with the power to override restrictive local zoning practices for projects that commit to
develop 20-25% of units at prices affordable to those earning 80% or less of the area’s median
income.43 This policy has generated as much controversy as it has housing, but has made a
significant impact in the latter category. As of 2006, more than 48,000 units, including 26,000
affordable to those earning 80% of area median income, had been constructed under the 40B
approval process.44 
In 2004, Massachusetts passed Chapter 40R, a “smart growth” policy that expanded the
repertoire of statewide incentive zoning practices. Chapter 40R aims to increase the production
of housing by providing monetary incentives for communities to create overlay districts that
allow for more dense housing construction. Since 2005, 9,613 units have been approved under
40R, of which 18 are in Belmont. In 2005, the state added Chapter 40S, which provides
supplemental funding to cover additional school costs associated greater density. Unlike 40B, 
40R and 40S provide financial incentives to local communities,45 but do not give developers an
appeal process to override local zoning decisions. 
Chapter 40B and Chapters 40R/40S offer two distinct models for statewide incentive zoning
policies. The experience of these two policies will inevitably frame a statewide debate of any
green incentive zoning policy. 
DENSITY BONUS CASE STUDIES 
As concern with sprawl and GHG emissions spreads across the country, so to have innovative
policies for counteracting these trends. As of March 2009, eight localities have instituted some
form of density bonus to incentivize development of green building practices in either the
commercial or residential sectors,46 and one locality has enacted a density bonus for green
industrial developments.

APPENDIX B.
ACTON, MASSACHUSETTS 
This is not the first time density bonuses have been discussed in Massachusetts. In 2004, the
town of Acton unanimously adopted a new zoning law for the East Acton Village District (EAV) 
at the Annual Town Meeting that included a density bonus for LEED Certified developments. 
The process through which Acton instituted this zoning change is worth noting, as it points to the
importance of process in instituting a policy that might increase density. Before reaching Town
Meeting in 2004, the EAV density bonus went through more than two years of vetting. It was
first proposed by a member of the specialized area planning committee, a group made up of 16
community members. This member had recently moved from Arlington, VA, where a similar
policy was introduced and passed in 2000 (see below). 
Page | 20 
Page 29
According to the town planner assigned to the project, 
the key to the density bonus’s success was twofold. 
Acton, MA
First, the community discussed the various concerns
with the density bonus concept internally before taking

it to the public. In this process, the policy gained
support by incorporating several of the other committee
members’ favorite causes into the bonus incentive. 
Thus, in EAV a developer can achieve a density bonus
for complying with criteria other than green building
standards. For example, a developer who maintains the
historic integrity of a building or achieves a baseline of
affordability can receive a density bonus. Second, the
committee consisted of community leaders from
multiple sectors and political persuasions. Once they
had agreed to the concept of a density bonus, it became
part of their plan. This sense of ownership allowed

them to confront neighbors who might have otherwise been opposed to the idea of more density. 
While Acton was able to successfully incorporate a density bonus into the EAV zoning
ordinance, as of January 2009, no developer had taken advantage of that bonus. There are several
potential explanations for this. For one, EAV is a largely developed area and there is little
teardown activity. A second factor has to do with the slowdown in construction that came with
the bursting housing bubble. A third possible reason is the relative small size of the bonus. It
may be that a developer simply considers the density bonus insufficient to entice higher cost
green construction. 
Despite the lack of development activity in EAV, the density bonus policy has had another
positive outcome. According to the Assistant Town Planner, residents of Acton take enormous
pride in the policy and discussions are underway to incorporate the policy in their new Master
Plan currently under development. 
Page | 21 
Page 30
Lessons: 
  Involve a diverse set of community members. The extent to which they own the policy
will have a direct impact on whether the policy can overcome concerns with density. 
  Policies limited to small areas may not have much of an impact. 
  The total allowable FAR with the bonus may not be large enough to incentivize
developers. 
ARLINGTON COUNTY, VIRGINIA 
Arlington County is considered to be the pioneer in the world of density bonus policies. They
have developed an advanced, sophisticated set of tiered density bonuses depending on the level
of LEED achieved. For LEED Certified, developers receive a limited bonus, for LEED Silver, 
slightly more, and for LEED Gold and Platinum, the bonus is the highest. 
The primary rational for instituting the program was to control water quality. Arlington County
runs its own water treatment facility and the policy was instituted to reduce the impacts of
effluents from runoff. Over time, energy efficiency and VMT reduction have gained greater
emphasis. While USGBC’s LEED program was just getting started in 2000, it was considered
critical to have third party verification for the policy to work. 
Since its inception in 2000, the policy has undergone two revisions. The first, in 2003, led to an
increase in the level of incentives for LEED Silver and an expansion of the eligible projects to
include mixed-use and multi-family residential construction. The 2003 revision also instituted a
Green Building Fund to support the policy. Developers not seeking the density bonus were asked
to contribute $0.03 per square foot to the fund. If after completion, the project is certified, the
contribution is refunded to the developer. Since 2003, more than $150,000 has been contributed
the fund. The fund is primarily used for educational and training purposes. 
Page | 22 
Page 31
Since that revision, 24 projects have applied and
received preliminary bonus approvals. Three of these
projects used non-LEED certification programs
(EarthCraft and Green Home Choice47).
The Arlington plan operates under the constraints of a
state law that prevents localities from modifying
zoning law. It therefore only applies to large projects
that require site-plan approval, which were already
applying for zoning variances.

Currently, Arlington is undertaking a further revision
of the density policy. The revision increases the bonus
offered for LEED Gold and Platinum and reduces the
bonus for LEED Certified and Silver. According to the
Environmental Planner assigned to the green building
program, the primary reason for this change is that the
last eight years has seen developers largely
incorporate LEED Silver standards into their common
practices to meet market demand for LEED Certified
commercial buildings. The planning department sees
this normalization of green building practices as one

of the direct benefits of the density bonus policy. The revision also increases the Green Building
Fund contribution to $0.045 per square foot. 
Lessons: 
  Once instituted, a policy will need to be revisited, modified, and corrected. 
  Over time, it can encourage developers to incorporate green standards into their everyday
practice. 
  A tiered policy of increasing bonus size accurately reflects the increased costs of
achieving higher levels of certification and may encourage even greater efficiency gains. 
SEATTLE, WASHINGTON 
In April, 2006, Seattle adopted a density bonus policy that aimed to advance two publically
desired goods simultaneously: green construction and affordable housing. Unlike the other green
density bonuses discussed above, Seattle’s bonus is not exclusively aimed at incentivizing
greener construction practices. Rather, achieving LEED Silver rating is a condition for gaining
entry to a bonus program aimed at subsidizing affordable housing construction. In a marriage of
environmental and affordable housing advocates’ policy goals, the only way to qualify for the
affordable housing bonus is to build green. 
Seattle is not a novice in the use of density bonuses as a mechanism for gaining public benefits
for construction rights. The city began using density bonus schemes in the mid-1980s and has
employed them for public amenities such as sidewalks, parking, and dedicated green space. More
recently, they have been used to fund affordable housing. 
Page | 24 
Page 33
The green density bonus policy discussed here applies to
both commercial and residential development in four 
Seattle, WA
different downtown zones. In each zone, a builder that
has committed to LEED Silver or greater standards is
eligible to significantly increase the density of their lot. 
For residential construction, the bonus allows for
buildings to increase the height of their construction, 
between 10 and 15 floors depending on the zone. The city
levies a fee of $18.94 per square foot of bonus space. The
money collected goes into an affordable housing fund
managed by the city. Once approved by the zoning board
of reviews, it is then up to the developer to decide how
much additional height to build. 
The policy for commercial buildings has a few

differences. The basic scheme is similar, requiring LEED
Silver as condition for participating in program. However, 
for commercial developments, there is a small initial
bonus given for achieving LEED Silver, which sunsets 5

$9.5 m for affordable housing
years from the date of the policy’s approval. This bonus represents a small portion of the
potential density increase, which can be as much as 200% of base FAR (in one zone, and
increase from a base 6 FAR to 20 FAR). To access 75% of this additional bonus, the developer
must pay into an affordable housing fund at a price of $23 per square foot. Alternatively, the
developer can provide commensurate funds for childcare. Providing for non-housing public
amenities, such as green space or human resource development, gives the developer access to the
remaining 25% of bonus allotment. 
After approval, the city gave initial density bonus approvals to 17 hotels, mixed-use, and
apartment building developments as well as three commercial developments. Two apartment
buildings have completed construction and three others are in some stage of construction. Nearly
all of these have taken advantage of the full allowable density bonus. The city expects these to
Page | 25 
Page 34
add approximately one third more physical living space than would have been constructed absent
the policy. 
The impact on housing prices has been minimal, but the potential to increase the stock of
affordable housing is increased with each additional square foot constructed. As of February
2009, close to $10 million has been contributed the affordable housing fund or directly to
affordable housing. 
Seattle’s program offers an excellent example of the possibility of achieving two vital public
goods within the realm of one policy. However, there is one dramatic reason why the policy
would be difficult to translate to Massachusetts. The policy applies to the already densely built
downtown core. Any effort to translate it to a regional growth plan would encounter significant
resistance. To date, Seattle’s density policies have had very limited impact in the single-family
neighborhoods that would be touched by a regional policy. 
Lessons: 
  Density bonuses can be very valuable to developers, which may allow the imposition of
impact fees or other requirements. 
  Even in Seattle, the politics of density prevent an expansion of the policy to include low-
density residential neighborhoods. 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY, MARYLAND 
In 2006, Montgomery County instituted a number of reforms to promote green building
practices. In particular, the county mandated LEED Certification for all publicly funded projects
(with at least 30% County support) and all buildings over 10,000 square feet, and they
established tax incentives for LEED Gold and Platinum projects. 
However, they did not implement a density bonus policy after considering it. The primary
resistance came from negative perceptions of density. The Clarksburg development (a large
planned community in northern Montgomery County)48 was often cited as a recent development
Page | 26 
Page 35
many considered to be poorly designed, because it was too dense. Nevertheless, the county and
the Maryland National Capital Region Park and Planning Commission have continued to discuss
the policy concept. Additionally, they have continued to add new policies to promote green
building practices. For example, beginning in 2010, all new single family homes must be
certified by the EPA’s Energy Star Home program. 
Lesson: 
  Density bonus policies still face significant resistance even in communities strongly
interested in promoting green building practices.

Applies only to two non-residential zoning
categories. 
There is considerable variation in the existing density bonus policies. Most offer a FAR bonus
for commercial and residential developments requiring a site review. No communities have
implemented by-right bonuses and most are focused primarily on larger developments with little
to no focus on the single-family detached housing stock. Efforts to green single-family homes
have largely been through mandates or financial and other non-density related incentives to
adopt programs like Energy Star for Homes. 
Given the potential value to developers of FAR bonuses and the low additional construction
costs, impact fees and other contributions seem to be a viable option as part of a density bonus
policy. Tiered policies that reward higher certification levels also appear to be viable policy
options. However, the total allowable FAR under the policy needs to be large enough to
incentivize developers to build infill housing, which often requires tearing down existing
structures. 
FOCUS GROUP 
A focus group was held in Belmont Town Library on January 31st, 2009, to discuss the density
bonus policy concept with community members. The meeting was attended by nine community
members (five women and four men), self-selected from a list of 12 people invited by Rep. 
Brownsberger to participate. We asked Rep. Brownsberger to invite people based on two factors: 
their level of previous engagement with community affairs and the relative diversity of opinions
that the group could represent. While the group was primarily liberal in orientation, it was a
Page | 29 
Page 38
fairly diverse crowd, representing voices from the affordable housing, environmental, scientific, 
planning, and business communities of Belmont. 
The meeting was a spirited two-hour conversation, in which we briefly presented the policy
concept in the context of our on-going research and then opened the floor to discussion. Our
initial goal had been to gain insight into what the discussion group attendees liked about the
policy idea as well as what they disliked. While we learned only momentarily about the former
and haphazardly about the latter, we gained significant insight into some of the challenges that
face any effort to successfully incorporate a density bonus into Belmont. 
While it was difficult to delineate which concerns were more relevant than others, the following
issue threads were identifiable and salient: 
  LEED – People like the idea of creating more green housing, even if the means for
achieving it (density bonus) evoked concern and criticism, the group was not opposed to
encouraging green building practices. 
  History of Teardowns – As soon as the idea of a density bonus came up, several in the
group immediately evoked a doomsday scenario in which all the building in town would
be torn down and replaced with new, multi-unit structures. This fear emanated from
experiences in neighborhoods where teardowns of single family detached homes to build
duplexes happened during the housing bubble. 
  Cost of School Children – The idea of attracting more people to Belmont led to a
discussion of the potential tax liabilities of more school children. 
  Increased congestion 
  Where will people come from? – The idea of density in Belmont having an appreciably
positive effect on VMT was questioned. “What if people move to Belmont from
Boston?” one participant asked. 
  Tax Incentives/Mandates – When confronted with the idea of allowing more density, the
conversation led several times back to the idea of using tax incentives or mandates to
achieve LEED/green buildings. 
Page | 30 
Page 39
  How would Belmont benefit? – an enduring question in the course of the conversation
circled around this question. If the policy had so many potential negatives (see above),
then why should Belmont take a risk without a clear reward? 
From this conversation, we gleaned several important lessons: 
  The potential benefits of LEED need to be carefully and clearly presented. 
  Conversation should focus on the need to improve housing stock and relation to GHG
emissions. 
  This policy needs to be incorporated into a broader strategy. The community is very
concerned about taking risks on its own. 
  In the absence of a directed conversation from a strong authority figure, the conversation
will quickly hone in on the question of density, leaving other values and purposes (reduce
GHG, improve energy efficiency) by the wayside. 
ASSESSING THE POLICY’S POTENTIAL IMPACT 
At the request of Rep. Brownsberger, we have examined the potential impact of a density bonus
policy in Belmont, MA. Our analysis considers the potential effects on housing supply and GHG
emissions from heating, cooling and electricity in residential units. 
BELMONT AND REGIONAL PROFILE 
Located approximately 7 miles northwest of Boston, the Town of Belmont has a population of
24,000. The town covers 4.71 square miles and has a median income of more than $80,000. 
Belmont has four primary residential zones, which cover 1,453 acres (48% of Belmont’s land
area). The top three communities where Belmont residents work are Boston (25%), Cambridge
(18%) and Belmont (15%). 49 Considered part of the inner core, Belmont is a member of the
Boston Metropolitan Area Planning Council (MAPC), which includes 22 cities and 78 other
towns and covers 1,422 square miles.50 The region’s population is more than 3 million. 
Page | 31 
Page 40
POTENTIAL FOR BELMONT TO UPDATE ITS HOUSING STOCK 
While Belmont is mostly developed (only 1% of Belmont’s land is considered developable),
there are still numerous possibilities to increase energy efficiency and reduce per capita VMT. 
Belmont’s housing stock is aging and slightly more than half of all residential units use heating
oil—a particularly carbon intense fuel. The percentage of housing that relies on oil for heating is
most concentrated in buildings that haven’t been updated in the last 30 years, which constitute
91% of all residential units. 
Source: Belmont Assessor’s Database, December 2008
According to the 2005 EIA Residential Energy Consumption Survey, New England homes that
used fuel oil for heating were responsible for more than twice as many GHG emissions as homes
that used natural gas.51 The age and reliance on heating oil represent an important possibility to
both update and reduce the carbon footprint of Belmont’s housing stock.

MODELING POLICY IMPACTS 
To estimate the impacts of a density bonus program, we consider five possible configurations of
the size of the bonus and the zones applicable. To mitigate the potential for larger units desirable
to families and to honor Belmont’s commitment to the preservation of open space, we assume no
change in the physical dimension limitations and other space restrictions in the current zoning
code. Thus the new units will be smaller than the units replaced. 
Using historical development rates, we model two scenarios for each configuration: a
low/moderate growth scenario and a high growth scenario. For the low/moderate growth, we
assume an average annual development rate of 0.1% based on the average annual rate of
development from 1999-2002 (0.11% actual). For the high growth scenario, we assume an
Page | 33 
Page 42
average annual development rate of 0.5% based on the average annual rate of development from
2005-2007 (0.43% actual).
However, two caveats are necessary to mention. First, predicting housing development in the
current market is extremely challenging as new construction has dropped to a crawl, but the
housing market is a cycle and over the next 10 to 20 years should recover. Second, the historical
rates are constrained by current zoning and do not reflect the possibility for higher density
development. The first caveat would lead us toward the low/moderate growth scenario, but the
second would lead us more toward the high growth scenario. Therefore, we present both with the
warning that reality is likely to differ from both scenarios. 
The five policy configurations we examine are as follows: 
Option
1
2
3
4
5 
Density Bonus
1 unit above current zoning
1 unit above current zoning
1 unit above current zoning
1 unit above current zoning
100% (double the allowable units) 
Area
Any residential zone
Any single residence only zone
Single residence zone A (largest lots) only
General residence zone only
General residence zone only
Note: new units refer to additional units above current housing stock. If a single family detached house is
demolished and a duplex is built on the same plot, this would show up as 1 new unit. 
Page | 34 
Page 43
In the short term, most configurations do not generate enough housing units to affect the
affordability of housing in Belmont. Under the high growth scenario, the long-term projections
for 20 years may generate enough housing (a little less than 10% of the current stock) to have a
slight impact on housing prices,52 but it is beyond the scope of this report to estimate the
magnitude of that impact.

Page 44
GHG EMISSIONS 
To model the impact of the policy on GHG emissions, we used the data on energy consumption
provided by the EIA’s 2005 Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS). The RECS
includes data on 394 New England residential units. While RECS provides details on energy use
by type, it does not convert the energy use into CO2 
emissions. We therefore rely on the
conversation factors provided by EIA: 73.15 kg CO2 
/ MMBtu for Heating Oil; 53.06 kg CO2 
/
MMBtu for Natural Gas; 0.572852 kg CO2 
/ kWh for electricity in MA. 53  We assume a 40% 
energy savings for green units. 
Source: 2005 EIA RECS
Using the growth estimates for the five policy options, we model the GHG emission reductions
for each option under both low/moderate growth assumptions and high growth assumptions. 
These estimates do not consider potential impacts from VMT, as that analysis is beyond the
scope of this project. However, we can conclude the overall VMT will increase in Belmont, but
will likely decrease for the region as a whole depending on where people move to Belmont from. 
Page | 36 
Page 45
Belmont Annual Reductions in CO2 
Emissions from Residential Heating/Cooling and
Electricity Compared to Business as Usual
Belmont’s current annual emissions are approximately 58,500 tonnes CO2
. The annual savings
under low/moderate growth assumptions after 20 years is therefore only 0.03% to 0.5% current
emissions. In the best case scenario under the most optimistic growth assumptions, the policy
reduces Belmont’s GHG emissions by 2.4% after 20 years. However, to get the 2.4% reduction, 
Belmont’s housing stock will need to increase by approximately 10%—a rate that is not likely to
be politically feasible. 
BENEFITS AND COSTS OF A DENSITY BONUS POLICY 
The proposed density bonus policy will create benefits and impose costs. However, the
distribution of benefits and costs is not uniform and in fact most of the costs are imposed on the
local municipality. 
LOCAL BENEFITS AND COSTS 
There are several benefits for municipalities that implement a green density bonus policy. Such a
policy will encourage the renovation of an aging housing stock and will increase the tax base. 
Added density increases the viability of local businesses and public transportation, and increases
Page | 37 
Page 46
the housing options for seniors looking to downsize or young adults looking to stay in the
community. Residents and prospective buyers also benefit from higher quality, healthier housing
with lower utility bills. 
Higher density does impose costs on municipalities. More residents can mean a higher level of
municipal services. While per capita VMT may decrease, overall VMT in the municipality is
likely to increase and additional cars require parking spaces. 
If children move into the new units, the school budgets may need to increase as well. Although
the new units add to the local tax base, a 2005 study for the Commonwealth Housing Task Force
found that the average cost of educating a child is higher than the additional property tax
revenues generated by adding units to a community.54 Their conclusions are likely exaggerated, 
because their analysis used average cost and not marginal cost. Nevertheless, the basic point is
accurate; the added costs of density are often higher than the added property tax revenues. 
REGIONAL BENEFITS AND COSTS 
From a regional perspective, the benefits of a density bonus policy largely depend on the location
of the density. Density near the urban core or within the inner suburban rings reduces
development pressures on the urban fringe, which reduces the need for expansive infrastructure
developments and preserves green space. Indeed, infill development often uses existing
infrastructure investments. While it may add costs to infrastructure maintenance, these added
costs are likely less than the added cost of expanding and then maintaining a larger network.55 
If the alternative is more low-density development on the fringe of the urban area, then in-fill
development reduces overall VMT in addition to reducing per capita VMT in the local
municipality. The benefit of a reduction in VMT is largely regional and diffuse in nature. 
However, if the policy is only adopted in a single community like Belmont, the overall impact on
VMT will likely be negligible. 
Page | 38 
Page 47
POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS 
If structured properly, a density bonus policy encouraging green residential construction would
be beneficial to the region and a worthwhile innovation. While the effects are likely to be small, 
especially if implemented in only one municipality, the policy could complement other efforts to
create more sustainable communities. 
Given the dichotomy of local costs and regional and individual benefits, the policy should be
enacted at the state level. To ensure maximum positive impact on VMT, a requirement of
proximity to transit should be established. However, it may be politically infeasible to pass state
legislation without a local pilot. In that event, we recommend pursuing multiple locations to pilot
the program to a) generate more data to evaluate the policy and b) share the burden among
multiple communities. 
CERTIFICATION PROGRAM 
Although other programs are less expensive for developers, we recommend using the USGBC’s
LEED for Homes program. LEED is a nationally recognized program that is comprehensive in
nature and monitors more than just energy efficiency. However, we recommend a minimum
certification level of LEED Silver with additional bonuses for LEED Gold and Platinum. The
market is increasingly going toward green construction,56 and LEED Certified can be achieved
without significant additional costs. 
The Massachusetts Department of Public Safety is currently considering a new “stretch” building
code that municipalities could voluntarily adopt.57 The new code is based on the Energy Star for
Homes program. At a minimum, we recommend the adoption of the new stretch code if passed, 
but a time restricted density bonus could be offered to gain developer support for the stricter
standards. 
Page | 39 
Page 48
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BELMONT 
Some compromises may need to be made to pass a density bonus policy in Belmont. To ease
parking concerns, the policy should be targeted to the larger lot single residence only zones. 
Additionally, the bonus should be structured as an allowable unit bonus and potentially a
minimum lot size reduction. We do not recommend an FAR bonus, although a small FAR bonus
could be an additional incentive for LEED Gold and Platinum. The result of this policy
configuration is smaller units, which may reduce the cost of each unit and limit the additional
number of school children.58 A small per square foot impact fee should be included in the policy
to offset some of the costs to the community. The revenues could be targeted to schools or to
outreach and administration of the program. 
Regardless of the exact policy configuration, we recommend the creation of a working group or
committee to vet and design the policy. The group should include as diverse a spectrum of
political perspectives as possible and should have sufficient mandate and leadership to keep all
voices in the process long enough to reach compromises. 
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A STATEWIDE POLICY 
As a statewide policy, we recommend using the Chapters 40R/40S framework and create a
“40U” to promote green building. This would allow municipalities that create 40U districts to be
compensated for the additional school costs of added units. The policy should have strong
location criteria that ensure the additional density reduces VMT. These constraints should
include distance to transit, diversity of nearby land uses and access to jobs. 
However, for an alternative potentially more impactful configuration, we recommend using the
Chapter 40B framework. By this we mean, allowing developers to override local zoning
constraints if certain community criteria are not met. This would necessarily be proposed within
a larger climate change policy with targets for emissions reductions. Communities that failed to
Page | 40 
Page 49
achieve an emissions target would then be eligible for the density bonus policy. Given the
negative perceptions of 40B, this configuration is likely to face steep political resistance. 
Regardless of the framework, a small per square foot fee should be included in the policy. The
funds should be used to support affordable housing in the state. 
It will be important to designate a statewide coordinator for the policy. The coordinator should
be available to answer technical questions and encourage community adoption of 40U zones. 
EVALUATION 
Whether the policy is adopted at the state level or in a specific municipality, an evaluation plan
should be established. We recommend evaluations every five years to monitor the program’s
effectiveness and allow for a regular review of the bonus structure. As standard building
practices and technologies change, the policy should also adapt and adjust to ensure the policy is
not rewarding developers for things they would have done absent the policy.

INCENTIVE AND INCLUSIONARY ZONING 
APPENDIX E
Incentive zoning has been used for nearly 50 years as a rewards system to encourage developers
to meet specific urban planning goals. The reward levers vary from tax breaks to financial
assistance, but have their origins in the use of density bonus schemes. New York City is
commonly considered the innovator in this area, first employing density bonuses in 1961 to
encourage developers to incorporate public plazas into large-scale commercial developments.60 
After the rise of restrictive zoning early in the 20th century, the gradual relaxation of zoning
requirements embedded in incentive zoning schemes became an important policy tool for
municipalities to achieve small-scale public amenity goals. As the 20th century wore on, more
and more states and large municipalities began to utilize incentives to achieve a diverse array of
public policy goals. By the late 1980s, most large cities had incorporated some form of incentive
mechanism into their municipal codes.61 
At the same time that incentive zoning was becoming a common policy tool, the issue of housing
affordability began to move from federal to local policy debates. In most states zoning policies
are delegated to municipal level governments. During the 20th century, these localities have
enacted numerous policies, such as minimum lot size and construction moratoriums, whose
impact has been to discourage affordable housing construction. To counteract these exclusionary
zoning practices, many states and localities have begun to intervene by changing zoning policies
in order to correct for these past exclusionary practices. 
There has been a special focus on incentivizing affordable housing provision through four
mechanisms: local regulatory reform, inclusionary zoning, rent control, and statewide policy
strategies.62 The first relates to specific changes in zoning policy, such as reducing minimum lot
size or allowing more dense construction. The second involves local incentives, such as density
bonuses or tax breaks, or mandates to create more affordable housing. These take the form of
specific percentages of affordable housing for developments over a particular size (usually above
five units) or the payment of affordable housing fees in lieu of development. The third
incorporates efforts to make non-ownership units more accessible to low income residents, with
mixed results. The final option of state legislative action to retool local zoning authority has the
largest potential for producing significant changes in the housing market.63

greenhouse sewage 
The squeaky-clean details of solar aquatics
Lane Hartill
Special to The Christian Science Monitor
Date: 01/06/2000 (WESTON, MASS.)
With the smell of a freshly tossed garden salad and the
glassy look of a botanical museum, this Massachusetts
wastewater treatment plant will amaze you. It's a
greenhouse that turns 4,000 gallons of sewage into
sparkling water each day. The system is known as solar
aquatics, a process that replicates nature's cleansing
action by which plants and microbes purify waste. After
years of pilot projects and toiling under skepticism,
solar aquatic facilities are sprouting up not only in the US, but around the world. They're
also gaining ground on traditional wastewater treatment facilities that can be concrete
eyesores with rank lagoons that neighborhoods balk at and city councils dread. The three-
year-old plant here in the center of Weston, a small town 15 miles from Boston, serves
about 30 businesses. 
Inside the 70-by-40 foot greenhouse, 16 gravity-fed tanks brew sewage with the help of
floating flora. Mint, watercress, primroses, water lilies, cherry tomatoes, and celery, suck
up contaminants. Even a few fish and snails help out. Phil
Henderson, chief executive officer of Ecological Engineering
Associates (EEA), which owns and operates the greenhouse,
strolls between the tanks pulling back greenery billowing over
the sides. "Not sure how these got here," he says, pointing to the
tomatoes. "Don't worry," he smiles, "we don't eat them." Aerated
from the bottom of the tank to blend the muck, microbes gradually break down the organic
matter as it flows through the process. While the flora only absorbs about 10 percent of the
contaminants, their roots provide ideal living conditions and attachment sites for
microorganisms. After flowing through the tanks, the sewage is further polished in a man-
made marsh in the back of the greenhouse. On top of five feet of
rocks sits the marsh where water leaches through the reeds and
cattails. Microbial organisms clinging to rocks beneath the marsh
pull oxygen off the remaining nitrates in the water, releasing it as
gas. In the final stage, the water is pumped into a natural wetland
behind the greenhouse. The plant in Weston has the capacity to
handle 25,000 gallons of sewage, which is a mere drip compared
with most sewage treatment plants, but the benefits are numerous.
Thanks to this process, businesses in this white-steepled town are
better off. Before the greenhouse was built (right off main street),
businesses pumped their wastewater into holding tanks behind their
back doors, because the high water table didn't allow for septic systems. The waste then
had to be hauled away, Mr. Henderson says, for 11 to 15 cents per gallon. Now, businesses
pay 10 cents per gallon to have Ecological Engineering Associates purify it. "There is
progressively increasing interest in natural systems," says Mr. Henderson. "It's an

greenhouse sewage
alternative technique that should be looked at and used." There are several advantages:
It produces half or less as much sludge than most industrial plants, which is hauled
away only three times a year, much less than municipal facilities.
Most residents would rather have a greenhouse next to them than a traditional
treatment plant.
It is a great learning tool for students and the community.
Henderson says several groups a month visit, from graduate students
in land planning to chemistry classes. The facility in Bear River,
Nova Scotia, attracted 8,000 tourists in its first year. Solar aquatics
isn't a quaint New England phenomenon. EEA has a plant in La Paz,
Mexico, one in Metz, France, and several more plants in Canada. A
new plant has recently been approved for an environmentally
sustainable community in Fredericksburg, Va., that will handle 1
million gallons a day and serve 4,000 households. Living
Technologies, another wastewater treatment facility in Burlington,
Vt., has installed large systems around the world, from a 10,000
gallons per day (gpd) facility for the National Audubon Society in
southwest Florida to a large system that handles more than 200,000 gpd at a pet-food
processing plant near Sao Paulo, Brazil. 
Despite the eco-friendly aspects of solar aquatic facilities, several
factors inhibit their development across the country - mainly a
reluctance to break away from traditional technology. Henderson says
that "consulting engineers are well versed in conventional wastewater
treatment plants." When alternative methods such as solar aquatics
are proposed, "you end up with a lot of different opinions." He also
says city planning systems are rooted in bureaucracy. This makes it
difficult for some communities to embrace new wastewater treatment
technology. "The decision process to build a wastewater treatment
facility is very lengthy and very tedious," says Henderson. But it can be less expensive to
build than traditional facilities. Bruce Strong, operations manager at the Weston plant, said
the greenhouse operation here cost between $700,000 and $750,000 to build. Other
ecological wastewater treatment plant operators agree that the industry has yet to be fully
accepted because of the adherence to traditional systems. "It's so new, it's hard to get
people living in a bureaucracy to look outside the box," says Tedann Olsen, Marketing
Manager at Living Technologies, which has more than 20 systems worldwide. "It's the way
earth has been purifying wastewater forever. Some get it right away, some don't want to
bother," she says.

When to Consider Distributed Systems in an Urban and Suburban Context 
CASESTUDY: WESTON, MASSACHUSETTS, SOLAR AQUATIC SYSTEM 
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
Location: Weston, Massachusetts (latitude: 42°21’59” N; longitude: 71°18’10” W) 
Collection: Gravity sewers from each
building feed three e-One grinder pump
stations that then transfer sewage to the
treatment plant. Grease traps, which are
owned by the building owners, provide
preliminary treatment at each building. 
Treatment: Solar aquatics systems (SAS) 
are a hybrid activated-sludge/ 
engineered-ecosystem process. Influent
wastewater from grinder pumps is
introduced into an aerated flow
equalization/blending tank, which also receives return activated sludge. From the equalization
tank, mixed liquor is pumped to a dual-train configuration of transparent-walled tanks that
support the growth of aquatic vegetation, algae, zooplankton, and snails that digest
contaminants and extract nutrients. Gravity separation of solids occurs in a settling tank and
the solids are recirculated while the treated water is further treated using sand filtration, 
subsurface anoxic wetlands, and finally disinfection. 
Product disposition: Treated water recharges the groundwater via a soil absorption system. 
This system consists of recharge trenches beneath a stone driveway. 
Flowrate: Designed to serve 38 to 45 m3/d (10,000 to 12,000 gpd); current average flow is 23
m3/d (6000 gpd).
Service area: Commercial business area, including supermarkets, restaurants, banks, medical
and commercial offices, and retail stores. 
Case study type: Commercial cluster for independent community. 
Management type: Private (partnership) ownership and management. 
Cost: Actual cost was $750,000, including leach field for dispersal, which was within the
margin for error of the estimated cost. Costs were reportedly higher than typical for this type
of system due to installation challenges associated with the construction of the foundation, 
sewers and leachfield in peaty soils.

The solar aquatic system (SAS) was constructed to provide wastewater service to a core
commercial area in the town of Weston, Massachusetts, because of failing septic systems. The
commercial businesses had grease traps that did not adequately protect the septic systems, 
which was causing system failure. The
Massachusetts Department of
Environmental Protection (MADEP) 
stepped in and required property
owners who were in violation of
onsite wastewater treatment
regulations to upgrade their systems. 
Property owners formed a limited
partnership to design, build, own, and
manage the system. 
The treatment system consists of
several natural treatment stages

flow anoxic wetlands and UV disinfection and is divided into three stages: 
(1) Aerated equalization and pretreatment buffers flow variations and provides
approximately 47% reduction of biological oxygen demand (BOD). This process takes
place in buried concrete tanks beneath a sidewalk that adjoins the commercial
building. 
(2) A four-train configuration of 16 transparent-walled tanks supports growth of aquatic
vegetation, algae, zooplankton, and snails that digest contaminants and extract
nutrients for plant growth. Gravity separation of solids occurs in a settling tank, and
the solids are recirculated while the treated water is further refined through sand
filtration. (Solids produced in this stage consist largely of algae microorganisms, which
could possibly be dried for energy production purposes.)
(3) A subsurface, anoxic wetland provides denitrification and further treatment and is
followed by UV disinfection. Decomposing roots are a carbon source and help support
the denitrification process. The need for additional carbon in the form of acetate or
methanol/ethanol is variable over the seasons; the feed rate is adjusted based on
process control sampling. Typically, more supplemental carbon is needed in winter
when light levels are lower and there is less plant photosynthesis for root exudate
production and growth. All treated water is recharged to the subsurface groundwater, 
and some is recirculated to the head of the plant to maintain a consistent hydraulic
flow.

The system is contained in a greenhouse, which allows year-round growth of vegetation under
controlled environmental conditions. As a hybrid system, it uses well-established technology
such as aerated activated sludge treatment along with natural processes to the greatest
extent practical to create a bucolic and functional wastewater process that is located among
the buildings served. 
While groundwater dispersal of treated
effluent at the site is limited to 27 m3/d
(7000 gpd), the pretreatment system is
designed for a capacity of 38 to 45 m3/d
(10,000 to 12,000 gpd), because MADEP
wanted the treatment plant
overdesigned. Redundancy in the
treatment plant design does help if and
when rehabilitation work is needed, 
such as changing the bags inside the
solar tanks. Approximately two-thirds of
the tanks can be taken offline, and the
system can still function. 
It is possible that by reusing effluent for
flushing toilets and irrigation, the same
soil absorption system could service
more users, which could be added as
members of the limited partnership. The
town is considering extending the
service area, which is entirely owned by
the partnership, although this would
require appropriate zoning approvals for
new development based on the local
land use regulations. If the sewer

collection pipes have to cross public right-of-ways, however, then a public wastewater utility
may need to be established. This could prove complicated because there is no enabling
legislation for private wastewater systems in Massachusetts. 
PROJECT GOALS
The goal of this project was to provide a natural system that would add beauty to the
community while providing vital water quality and public health services. The system also
serves as an educational tool and is visited routinely by local school classes.

TIMELINE
After decades of discussion, the MADEP ultimately required property owners to provide a
design by 1996 with system to be operational 1997. The system was put into service in 1997. 
DECISION MAKING
Based on groundwater sampling and testing and observed failures of existing systems, the
local board of health determined that failing onsite septic systems in Weston’s business
district were adversely affecting an adjacent natural wetland. The MADEP determined that
grease trap maintenance and the overall wastewater management approach, which relied on
individual septic systems, was inadequate. The MADEP rules require at least a 15 m (50 ft) 
buffer between wastewater systems and wetlands; the existing systems did not meet this
requirement and were deemed to be inadequate for protecting the wetland. 
As a result, MADEP required affected properties owners to upgrade their systems. The
department pressed for a municipally owned conventional wastewater treatment plant. Local
residents fought against that plan for years, however, based on the experiences of other
towns where centralized sewer systems led to unrestricted development that negatively
affected the character of the town. Additionally, a suitable location could not be established. 
After a municipally owned and operated system option fell through, the MADEP and affected
property owners agreed to go with a decentralized approach. Property owners hired an
engineering consultant to evaluate alternatives, which led to the recommendation to use the
SAS approach because of its low impact to the community and ability to meet MADEP effluent
requirements. In addition to the SAS, packaged treatment systems that used traditional
treatment mechanisms were considered. Ultimately, preservation of community character
and control of growth were the primary reasons why a traditional municipal wastewater
system was not proposed. The SAS system was selected as a way to provide a neighborhood-
friendly wastewater treatment system that could meet stringent groundwater discharge
requirements. 
CHALLENGES
The biggest challenge was that there were no SAS or other larger, similar systems in use in
Massachusetts at the time, so the technology was considered innovative. Although SAS had
been tested as pilot systems, this was a first implementation of this technology in a large-
scale, private application. As a new, innovative technology, the system was difficult to permit, 
and the process was fraught with state and local regulatory roadblocks. Now that the system
has been in use for 12 years, comfort and confidence among state and local regulators is good. 
In addition, less redundancy would be required in the system designs, which will help lower
capital costs going forward. 
Maintenance of grease traps is still an issue, even with the community system, because failure
to maintain them may clog the downstream grinder pumps and other mechanical equipment.

FINANCING
A limited partnership of property owners was formed and no sophisticated form of bank
financing was used. The entire project was funded privately, including investment of property
owners’ capital and user fees for investment recapture, future system replacement, and
operating and maintenance costs. By law, there is a sinking fund for system maintenance; by
design, user fees are based upon water usage with the operating costs distributed accordingly. 
MANAGEMENT 
The property owners that suffered from the failing septic system conditions came together
and formed a limited partnership to finance, build, own, and operate the wastewater system. 
The system is contract operated by Ecological Engineering Group, which provides routine labor
and system monitoring in accordance with MADEP operator license requirements. Capital and
operating expenses are funded by the partnership. 
Only one entity could be permitted by the MADEP to have responsibility for system
performance. Municipal ownership alternatives were rejected because town residents did not
want a public entity involved. The public did not oppose formation of a limited partnership. 
Because the system has been operational for more than a decade and confidence is higher, a
town would be more likely to consider a municipal ownership and/or operation model. There
is no reason now, however, for Weston to take this system over. 
All costs are recovered monthly by charging a user fee based on water meter readings. The
limited partnership also handles billing and collections, and customer complaints are handled
through the licensed operators because most are associated with blocked grinder pumps. 
PERMITS 
The MADEP administers the groundwater discharge permit, which is enforced based on
effluent flow and quality. Monthly water quality (effluent and groundwater monitoring) 
reports are filed with the MADEP. The MADEP evaluates performance by reviewing the
monthly reports and through periodic unannounced inspections, typically on an annual basis. 
PERFORMANCE
The system is meeting water quality objectives and stated project goals. The natural system
approach conformed to the town’s cultural character. Conservation of energy and chemicals, 
although sustainable, was achieved by default rather than design. 
The process is working and improvements are being made to boost efficiency of the plant to
lower the operations and maintenance costs to the owner. Improved control mechanisms and
different plant species will help reduce power consumption. The plants used are tropical in
nature, whereas evergreens seem to serve these purposes adequately and would eliminate
the need for heating.
