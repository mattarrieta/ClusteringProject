Information and Instructions
Massachusetts General Laws chapter 152 requires all employers to provide workers’ compensation for their employees. 
Pursuant to this statute, an employee is defined as “...every person in the service of another under any contract of hire, 
express or implied, oral or written.”
An employer is defined as “an individual, partnership, association, corporation or other legal entity, or any two or more
of the foregoing engaged in a joint enterprise, and including the legal representatives of a deceased employer, or the
receiver or trustee of an individual, partnership, association or other legal entity, employing employees. However the
owner of a dwelling house having not more than three apartments and who resides therein, or the occupant of the
dwelling house of another who employs persons to do maintenance, construction or repair work on such dwelling house
or on the grounds or building appurtenant thereto shall not because of such employment be deemed to be an employer.”
MGL chapter 152, §25C(6) also states that “every state or local licensing agency shall withhold the issuance or
renewal of a license or permit to operate a business or to construct buildings in the commonwealth for any
applicant who has not produced acceptable evidence of compliance with the insurance coverage required.”
Additionally, MGL chapter 152, §25C(7) states “Neither the commonwealth nor any of its political subdivisions shall
enter into any contract for the performance of public work until acceptable evidence of compliance with the insurance
requirements of this chapter have been presented to the contracting authority.”
Applicants
Please fill out the workers’ compensation affidavit completely, by checking the boxes that apply to your situation and, if
necessary, supply sub-contractor(s) name(s), address(es) and phone number(s) along with their certificate(s) of
insurance. Limited Liability Companies (LLC) or Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP) with no employees other than the
members or partners, are not required to carry workers’ compensation insurance. If an LLC or LLP does have
employees, a policy is required. Be advised that this affidavit may be submitted to the Department of Industrial
Accidents for confirmation of insurance coverage. Also be sure to sign and date the affidavit. The affidavit should
be returned to the city or town that the application for the permit or license is being requested, not the Department of
Industrial Accidents. Should you have any questions regarding the law or if you are required to obtain a workers’ 
compensation policy, please call the Department at the number listed below. Self-insured companies should enter their
self-insurance license number on the appropriate line.
City or Town Officials
Please be sure that the affidavit is complete and printed legibly. The Department has provided a space at the bottom
of the affidavit for you to fill out in the event the Office of Investigations has to contact you regarding the applicant. 
Please be sure to fill in the permit/license number which will be used as a reference number. In addition, an applicant
that must submit multiple permit/license applications in any given year, need only submit one affidavit indicating current
policy information (if necessary) and under “Job Site Address” the applicant should write “all locations in ______(city or
town).” A copy of the affidavit that has been officially stamped or marked by the city or town may be provided to the
applicant as proof that a valid affidavit is on file for future permits or licenses. A new affidavit must be filled out each
year. Where a home owner or citizen is obtaining a license or permit not related to any business or commercial venture
(i.e. a dog license or permit to burn leaves etc.) said person is NOT required to complete this affidavit.
