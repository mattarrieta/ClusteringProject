Estimated Impact on Water & Sewer Rates
• Rate Setting Depends on Total Budget and
Water and Sewer Consumption
• Current modeling indicates that rates would
increase 3% for water and 8% for sewer – a
combined rate increase of 6%
• The average family annual increase would be
$90.84
• Average senior annual increase would be
$12.72
• Two variables still watching: 
– consumption for April, May and June
– and MWRA final assessment
