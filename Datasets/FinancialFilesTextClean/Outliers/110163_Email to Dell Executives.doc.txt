Subject Line: How do Alpha Females Lead Differently than Alpha Males?
 
What differentiates the competitive and ambitious male leaders from the powerful and determined female ones? Men and women bring obvious gender differences to the corporate round table, but how exactly do they lead differently? 
 
These are just a few of the ideas presented in Kate Ludeman and Eddie Erlandson’s new survey, “Predicting Leadership Success”. This survey explores how women and men lead differently and assesses how to predict your own success as a leader. 
 
Your participation will help us collect data for an upcoming article and newly renovated Alpha Assessment. To help us discover how women and men lead differently, please click the link below:
