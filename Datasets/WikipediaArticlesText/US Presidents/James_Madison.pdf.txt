James Madison
James Madison Jr. (March 16, 1751[b] – June 28, 1836) was
an American statesman, diplomat, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States"] Founding Father who
served as the 4th [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"] president of the United States from 1809 to
1817. He is hailed as the "Father of the Constitution" for his
 pivotal role in drafting and promoting the Constitution of the
United States and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights"] Bill of Rights. 
James Madison
Born into a prominent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"] Virginia [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planter_class"] planter family, Madison served
as a member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_House_of_Delegates"] Virginia House of Delegates and the
 Continental Congress during and after the American
Revolutionary War. Disillusioned by the weak national
government established by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation"] Articles of Confederation, he
helped organize the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)"] Constitutional Convention, which
produced a new constitution. Madison's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Plan"] Virginia Plan served
as the basis for the Constitutional Convention's deliberations,
and he was one of the most influential individuals at the
convention. He became one of the leaders in the movement to
ratify the Constitution, and he joined with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay"] John Jay in writing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers"] The Federalist Papers, a series of pro-
ratification essays that was one of the most influential works of
political science in American history.
 Madison emerged as an important leader in the House of
 Representatives and was a close adviser to President George
Washington. During the early 1790s, Madison opposed the
economic program and the accompanying centralization of
power favored by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury"] Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton and
organized the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic%E2%80%93Republican_Party"] Democratic–Republican Party in opposition to
 Hamilton's Federalist Party. After Jefferson was elected
president, Madison served as his Secretary of State from 1801
 to 1809. In that position, he supervised the Louisiana
Purchase, which doubled the size of the United States.
Madison won the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1808_United_States_presidential_election"] 1808 presidential election. After diplomatic
protests and a trade embargo failed to end [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland"] British seizures of
 American shipping, he led the United States into the War of
1812. The war was an administrative morass and ended
inconclusively, but many Americans saw it as a successful
"second war of independence" against Britain. As the war
progressed, Madison was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1812_United_States_presidential_election"] re-elected in 1812, albeit by a
smaller margin to the 1808 election. The war convinced
Madison of the necessity of a stronger federal government. He

Americans, under Madison's presidency.
In 1817, Madison retired from public office after concluding
his presidency, and returned to his plantation, Montpelier, and
died there in 1836. Like Jefferson and Washington, Madison
was a wealthy slave owner who never privately reconciled his
 republican beliefs with his slave ownership. Forced to pay
debts, he never freed his slaves. Madison is considered one of
the most important Founding Fathers of the United States, and
 historians have generally ranked him as an above-average
president, although they are critical of how Madison executed
the War of 1812.

Early life and education
James Madison, Jr. was born on March 16, 1751 (March 5, 1750,
 Old Style) at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belle_Grove_(Port_Conway,_Virginia)"] Belle Grove Plantation near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Conway,_Virginia"] Port Conway in the
 Colony of Virginia, to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison_Sr."] James Madison Sr. and Nelly Conway
Madison. His family had lived in Virginia since the mid-1600s.[1]
Madison's maternal grandfather was a prominent planter and
tobacco merchant.[2] His father was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_in_the_American_colonies"] tobacco planter who grew up
at a plantation, then called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montpelier_(James_Madison)"] Mount Pleasant, which he had inherited
upon reaching adulthood. With an estimated 100 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States"] slaves[1] and a
5,000 acres (2,000 ha) plantation, Madison's father was the largest Madison's Birthplace
landowner and a leading citizen in Piedmont. In the early 1760s,
the Madison family moved into a newly built house that they
named Montpelier.[3] Madison grew up as the oldest of twelve children,[4] with seven brothers and four
sisters, though only six lived to adulthood.[3]
From age 11 to 16, Madison studied under Donald Robertson, a
Scottish instructor who served as a tutor for several prominent
planter families in the South. Madison learned mathematics,
geography, and modern and classical languages—he became
exceptionally proficient in Latin.[5][6] At age 16, Madison returned
to Montpelier, where he studied under the Reverend Thomas
Martin to prepare for college. Unlike most college-bound
 Virginians of his day, Madison did not attend the College of
William and Mary, where the lowland [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamsburg,_Virginia"] Williamsburg climate—
thought to be more likely to harbor infectious disease—might have
strained his delicate health. Instead, in 1769, he enrolled as an
undergraduate at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton"] Princeton (then formally named the College of
New Jersey).[7]
His studies at Princeton included Latin, Greek, theology, and the
works of the Enlightenment.[8] Great emphasis was placed on both
speech and debate; Madison was a leading member of the

 James Sharples
 American Whig–Cliosophic Society, which competed on campus
with a political counterpart, the Cliosophic Society.[9] During his
time in Princeton, Madison's closest friend was future Attorney General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bradford_(Attorney_General)"] William Bradford.[10] Along with
another classmate, Madison undertook an intense program of study and completed the college's three-year
Bachelor of Arts degree in just two years, graduating in 1771.[11] Madison had contemplated either
entering the clergy or practicing law after graduation, but instead remained at Princeton to study Hebrew
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_philosophy"] political philosophy under the college's president, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Witherspoon"] John Witherspoon.[1] He returned home to
Montpelier in early 1772.[12]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1811,_Sharples,_James,_James_Madison.jpg"]
Page 4
Madison's ideas on philosophy and morality were strongly shaped by Witherspoon, who converted him to
the philosophy, values, and modes of thinking of the Age of Enlightenment. Biographer Terence Ball wrote
that at Princeton, Madison "was immersed in the liberalism of the Enlightenment, and converted to
eighteenth-century political radicalism. From then on James Madison's theories would advance the rights of
happiness of man, and his most active efforts would serve devotedly the cause of civil and political
liberty."[13]
After returning to Montpelier, without a chosen career, Madison served as a tutor to his younger
siblings.[14] Madison began to study law books in 1773. He asked Princeton friend William Bradford, a
law apprentice under Edward Shippen in Philadelphia, to send him an ordered written plan on reading law
books. At the age of 22, there was no evidence that Madison, himself, made any effort to apprentice to any
lawyer in Virginia. By 1783, he had acquired an understanding of legal publications. Madison saw himself
as a law student but never as a lawyer—he never joined the bar or practiced. In his elder years, Madison
was sensitive to the phrase "demi-Lawyer", or "half-Lawyer", a derisive term used to describe someone
who read law books, but did not practice law.[15] Following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War"] Revolutionary War, Madison spent time at
Montpelier in Virginia studying ancient democracies of the world in preparation for the Constitutional
Convention.[16]
American Revolution and Articles of Confederation
In 1765, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain"] British Parliament passed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_Act_1765"] Stamp Act, which taxed the American colonists to help fund the
increasing costs of administrating [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_America"] British America. The colonists' opposition to the tax marked the start of a
conflict that would culminate in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution"] American Revolution. The disagreement centered on Parliament's right
to levy taxes on the colonists, who were not directly represented in that body. However, events deteriorated
until the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War of 1775–83, in which the colonists split into two
factions: Loyalists, who continued to adhere to George III, and the Patriots, whom Madison joined, under
the leadership of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Congress"] Continental Congress. Madison believed that Parliament had overstepped its bounds
by attempting to tax the American colonies, and he sympathized with those who resisted British rule.[17]
He also favored disestablishing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Church"] Anglican Church in Virginia; Madison believed that an established
religion was detrimental not only to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion"] freedom of religion but also because it encouraged excessive deference
to the authority of the state.[18]
In 1774, Madison took a seat on the local [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_safety_(American_Revolution)"] Committee of Safety, a pro-
revolution group that oversaw the local Patriot militia.[19] In October 1775,
he was commissioned as the colonel of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_Virginia"] Orange County militia, serving
as his father's second-in-command until he was elected as a delegate to the
 Fifth Virginia Convention, which was charged with producing Virginia's
first constitution.[20] Short in stature and frequently in poor health, Madison
never saw battle in the Revolutionary War, but he rose to prominence in
Virginia politics as a wartime leader.[21]
At the Virginia constitutional convention, he convinced delegates to alter
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Declaration_of_Rights"] Virginia Declaration of Rights to provide for "equal entitlement," rather
than mere "tolerance", in the exercise of religion.[22] With the enactment of
 the Virginia constitution, Madison became part of the Virginia House of
Delegates, and he was subsequently elected to the Virginia governor's
 Council of State,[23] where he became a close ally of Governor Thomas
 Jefferson.[24] On July 4, 1776, the United States Declaration of
Independence was published formally declaring the 13 American states an
independent nation.

Although Madison was not a signatory of the Articles of Confederation, he did contribute to the discussion
of religious freedom affecting the drafting of the Articles. Madison had proposed liberalizing the article on
religious freedom, but the larger Virginia Convention stripped the proposed constitution of the more radical
language. Other amendments by the committee and the entire Convention included the addition of a section
on the right to a uniform government (Section 14).[25] Madison again served on the Council of State, from
1777 to 1779, when he was elected to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress"] Second Continental Congress, the governing body of the United
States.[c] America faced a difficult war against Great Britain, as well as runaway inflation, financial
troubles, and lack of cooperation between the different levels of government. According to historian J.G.A.
Stagg, Madison worked to become an expert on financial issues, becoming a legislative workhorse and a
master of parliamentary coalition building.[19] Frustrated by the failure of the states to supply needed
requisitions, Madison proposed to amend the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation"] Articles of Confederation to grant Congress the power to
independently raise revenue through [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariffs_in_United_States_history"] tariffs on imports.[27]
Though General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"] George Washington, Congressman [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton, and other influential leaders also
favored the tariff amendment, it was defeated because it failed to win the ratification of all thirteen
states.[28] While a member of Congress, Madison was an ardent supporter of a close alliance between the
United States and France; and, as an advocate of westward expansion, he insisted that the new nation had
 to insure its right to navigation on the Mississippi River and control of all lands east of it in the Treaty of
Paris, which ended the Revolutionary War.[29] After serving in Congress from 1780 to 1783, Madison won
election to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1784.[30]
Father of the Constitution
As a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, Madison continued to advocate for religious freedom,
and, along with Jefferson, drafted the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Statute_for_Religious_Freedom"] Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. That amendment, which
guaranteed freedom of religion and disestablished the Church of England, was passed in 1786.[31] Madison
also became a land speculator, purchasing land along the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohawk_River"] Mohawk River in partnership with another
Jefferson protégé, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe"] James Monroe.[32] Throughout the 1780s, Madison advocated for reform of the Articles
of Confederation. He became increasingly worried about the disunity of the states and the weakness of the
central government after the end of the Revolutionary War in 1783.[33] He believed that "excessive
democracy" caused social decay, and was particularly troubled by laws that legalized [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_money"] paper money and
denied [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity"] diplomatic immunity to ambassadors from other countries.[34] He was also concerned about the
inability of Congress to capably conduct foreign policy, protect American trade, and foster the settlement of
the lands between the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains"] Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River.[35] As Madison wrote, "a crisis
had arrived which was to decide whether the American experiment was to be a blessing to the world, or to
blast for ever the hopes which the republican cause had inspired."[36] He committed to an intense study of
law and political theory and also was heavily influenced by Continental Enlightenment texts sent by
Jefferson from France.[37] He especially sought out works on international law and the constitutions of
"ancient and modern confederacies" such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic"] Dutch Republic, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Confederation"] Swiss Confederation, and the
 Achaean League.[38] He came to believe that the United States could improve upon past republican
experiments by its size; with so many distinct interests competing against each other, Madison hoped to
minimize the abuses of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_rule"] majority rule.[39] Additionally, navigation rights to the Mississippi River highly
concerned Madison. He disdained a proposal by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay"] John Jay that the United States acquiesce claims to the
river for 25 years, and, according to historian John Ketchum, Madison's desire to fight the proposal was a
major motivation in his to return to Congress in 1787.[40]
Before a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorum"] quorum was reached at the Philadelphia Convention on May 25, 1787,[42] Madison worked with
other members of the Virginia delegation, especially [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Randolph"] Edmund Randolph and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason"] George Mason, to create and
present the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Plan"] Virginia Plan.[43] This plan was an outline for a new federal constitution; it called for three
branches of government (legislative, executive, and judicial), a bicameral Congress (consisting of the
Page 6
 Senate and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"] House of Representatives) apportioned by
population, and a federal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Revision"] Council of Revision that would have the
right to veto laws passed by Congress. Reflecting the centralization
of power envisioned by Madison, the Virginia Plan granted the
Senate the power to overturn any law passed by state
governments.[44] The Virginia Plan did not explicitly lay out the
structure of the executive branch, but Madison himself favored a
single executive.[45] Many delegates were surprised to learn that
the plan called for the abrogation of the Articles and the creation of
a new constitution, to be ratified by special conventions in each
state, rather than by the state legislatures. With the assent of
prominent attendees such as Washington and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin"] Benjamin Franklin,
the delegates went into a secret session to consider a new
constitution.[46]
After the Philadelphia Convention ended in September 1787,
Madison convinced his fellow congressmen to remain neutral in the 
page one of the original copy
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Constitution"] U.S. Constitution
ratification debate and allow each state to vote upon the
Constitution.[47] Throughout the United States, opponents of the
Constitution, known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Federalism"] Anti-Federalists, began a public campaign
against ratification. In response, Hamilton and Jay began publishing
a series of pro-ratification newspaper articles in New York.[48]
After Jay dropped out of the project, Hamilton approached
Madison, who was in New York on congressional business, to
write some of the essays.[49] Altogether, Hamilton, Madison, and
 Jay wrote the 85 essays of what became known as The Federalist
Papers in six months, with Madison writing 29 of them. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouverneur_Morris"] Gouverneur Morris signs the
Federalist Papers successfully defended the new Constitution and Constitution before George
argued for its ratification by the people of New York. The articles Washington. Madison sits next to
were also published in book form and became a virtual debater's  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Morris_(financier)"] Robert Morris, in front of Benjamin

conventions. Historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Rossiter"] Clinton Rossiter called The Federalist 
 Franklin. Painting by John Henry
Hintermeister, 1925.[41]
Papers "the most important work in political science that ever has
been written, or is likely ever to be written, in the United
States".[50] Federalist No. 10, Madison's first contribution to The Federalist Papers,  became highly
regarded in the 20th century for its advocacy of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy"] representative democracy.[51] In Federalist 10, Madison
describes the dangers posed by factions and argues that their negative effects can be limited through the
formation of a large republic. He states that in large republics the large number of factions that emerge will
control their corrupting effect.[52][53] In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._51"] Federalist No. 51, he goes on to explain how the separation of
powers between three branches of the federal government, as well as between state governments and the
federal government, establishes a system of checks and balances that ensure that no one institution would
become too powerful.[54]
At the start of the convention in Virginia, Madison knew that most delegates had already made up their
minds, and he focused his efforts on winning the support of the relatively small number of undecided
delegates.[55] His long correspondence with Randolph paid off at the convention, as Randolph announced
that he would support unconditional ratification of the Constitution, with amendments to be proposed after
ratification.[56] Though Henry gave several persuasive speeches arguing against ratification, Madison's
expertise on the subject he had long argued for allowed him to respond with rational arguments to Henry's
emotional appeals.[57] In his final speech to the ratifying convention, Madison implored his fellow
delegates to ratify the Constitution as it had been written, arguing that failure to do so would lead to the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Foundation_of_the_American_Government_by_Henry_Hintermeister.jpg"]
Page 7
collapse of the entire ratification effort, as each state would seek favorable amendments.[58] On June 25,
1788, the convention voted 89–79 to ratify the Constitution, making Virginia the tenth state to do so.[59]
 New York ratified the constitution the following month, and Washington won the country's first presidential
election.[60]
Congressman and party leader (1789–1801)
Election to Congress
After Virginia ratified the constitution, Madison returned to New York and resumed his duties in the
Congress of the Confederation. With concerns both for his political career and over the possibility that
Henry and his allies would arrange for a second constitutional convention, Madison ran for the House of
Representatives.[61][62] At Henry's behest, the Virginia legislature [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering_in_the_United_States"] created congressional districts designed
to deny Madison a seat, and Henry recruited Monroe, a strong challenger to Madison. Locked in a difficult
race against Monroe, Madison promised to support a series of constitutional amendments to protect
individual liberties.[61] In an open letter, Madison wrote that, while he had opposed requiring alterations to
the Constitution before ratification, he now believed that "amendments, if pursued with a proper
moderation and in a proper mode ... may serve the double purpose of satisfying the minds of well-meaning
opponents, and of providing additional guards in favor of liberty."[63] Madison's promise paid off, as in
 Virginia's 5th district election, he gained a seat in Congress with 57 percent of the vote.[64]
Madison became a key adviser to President Washington, who valued Madison's understanding of the
constitution.[61] Madison helped Washington write his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_inauguration_of_George_Washington"] first inaugural address, and also prepared the official
House response to Washington's speech. He played a significant role in establishing and staffing the three
 Cabinet departments, and his influence helped Thomas Jefferson become the inaugural Secretary of
State.[65] At the start of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_United_States_Congress"] first Congress, he introduced a tariff bill similar to the one he had advocated for
under the Articles of the Confederation,[66] and Congress established a federal tariff on imports through the
 Tariff of 1789.[67] The following year, Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton introduced an ambitious
economic program that called for the federal assumption of state debts and the funding of that debt through
the issuance of federal securities. Hamilton's plan favored Northern speculators and was disadvantageous to
states such as Virginia that had already paid off most of their debt, and Madison emerged as one of the
principal Congressional opponents of the plan.[68] After prolonged legislative deadlock, Madison,
Jefferson, and Hamilton agreed to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1790"] Compromise of 1790, which provided for the enactment of
 Hamilton's assumption plan through the Funding Act of 1790. In return, Congress passed the Residence
Act, which established the federal capital district of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."] Washington, D.C., on the Potomac River.[69]
Bill of Rights
During the first Congress, Madison took the lead in pressing for the passage of several constitutional
amendments in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights"] Bill of Rights.[70] His primary goals were to fulfill his 1789 campaign pledge and to
prevent the calling of a second constitutional convention, but he also hoped to protect individual libertiesagainst the actions of the federal government and state legislatures. He believed that the enumeration of
specific rights would fix those rights in the public mind and encourage judges to protect them.[71] After
studying over two-hundred amendments that had been proposed at the state ratifying conventions,[72]
Madison introduced the Bill of Rights on June 8, 1789. His amendments contained numerous restrictions
on the federal government and would protect, among other things, freedom of religion, freedom of speech,
and the right to peaceful assembly.[73] While most of his proposed amendments were drawn from the
ratifying conventions, Madison was largely responsible for proposals to guarantee [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press"] freedom of the press,
Page 8
protect property from government seizure, and ensure [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial"] jury trials.[72] He also proposed an amendment to
prevent states from abridging "equal rights of conscience, or freedom of the press, or the trial by jury in
criminal cases".[74]
Madison's Bill of Rights faced little opposition; he had largely co-opted the Anti-Federalist goal of
amending the Constitution but had avoided proposing amendments that would alienate supporters of the
Constitution.[75] Madison's proposed amendments were largely adopted by the House of Representatives,
but the Senate made several changes.[76] Madison's proposal to apply parts of the Bill of Rights to the states
was eliminated, as was his change to the Constitution's preamble.[77] Madison was disappointed that the
Bill of Rights did not include protections against actions by state governments,[d] but the passage of the
document mollified some critics of the original constitution and shored up Madison's support in
Virginia.[72] Of the twelve amendments formally proposed by Congress to the states, ten amendments were
ratified on December 15, 1791, becoming known as the Bill of Rights.[78][e]
Founding the Democratic–Republican Party
After 1790, the Washington administration became polarized
among two main factions. One faction, led by Jefferson and
Madison, broadly represented Southern interests and sought close
relations with France. The other faction, led by Secretary of the
Treasury Hamilton, broadly represented Northern financial interests
and favored close relations with Britain.[80] In 1791, Hamilton
 introduced a plan that called for the establishment of a national
bank to provide loans to emerging industries and oversee the
money supply.[81] Madison and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party"] Democratic-Republican Party
fought back against Hamilton's attempt to expand the power of the
Federal Government at the expense of the sovereignty of the
individual States by opposing the formation of a national bank.
Madison used his influence in the Democratic–Republican Party to
oppose Hamilton's proposals. Madison argued that under the
Constitution, Congress did not have the power to create such an
institution.[82] Despite Madison's opposition, Congress passed a bill
to create the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bank_of_the_United_States"] First Bank of the United States. After a period of

consideration, Washington signed the banking bill into law in
February 1791.[81] As Hamilton implemented his economic program and Washington continued to enjoy
immense prestige as president, Madison became increasingly concerned that Hamilton would seek to
abolish the federal republic in favor of a centralized monarchy.[83]
When Hamilton submitted his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report_on_Manufactures"] Report on Manufactures, which called for federal action to stimulate the
development of a diversified economy, Madison once again challenged Hamilton's proposal. He sought to
mobilize public opinion by forming a political party based on opposition to Hamilton's policies.[84] Along
with Jefferson, Madison helped [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Freneau"] Philip Freneau establish the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gazette"] National Gazette, a Philadelphia newspaper
that attacked Hamilton's proposals.[85] In an essay published in the National Gazette in September 1792,
Madison wrote that the country had divided into two factions: his faction, which believed in "the doctrine
that mankind are capable of governing themselves," and Hamilton's faction, which allegedly sought the
establishment of an aristocratic monarchy and was biased towards the wealthy.[86] Those opposed to
Hamilton's economic policies, including many former Anti-Federalists, coalesced into Democratic–
 Republican Party,[f] while those who supported the administration's policies coalesced into the Federalist
Party.[87] In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1792_United_States_presidential_election"] 1782 presidential election, both major parties supported Washington for re-election, but the
Page 9
Democratic–Republicans sought to unseat Vice President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams"] John Adams. Because the Constitution's rules
 essentially precluded Jefferson from challenging Adams,[g] the party backed New York Governor George
Clinton for the vice presidency, but Adams won nonetheless.[89]
With Jefferson out of office after 1793, Madison became the de facto leader of the Democratic–Republican
Party.[90] When Britain and France [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars"] went to war in 1793, the U.S. was caught in the middle.[91] While the
differences between the Democratic–Republicans and the Federalists had previously centered on economic
matters, foreign policy became an increasingly important issue as Madison and Jefferson favored France
and Hamilton favored Britain.[92] War with Britain became imminent in 1794 after the British seized
hundreds of American ships that were trading with French colonies. Madison believed that a trade war with
 Britain would probably succeed, and would allow Americans to assert their independence fully. The British
West Indies, Madison maintained, could not live without American foodstuffs, but Americans could easily
do without British manufacturers.[93] Washington then secured friendly trade relations with Britain through
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Treaty"] Jay Treaty of 1794.[94] Madison and his Democratic–Republican allies were outraged by the treaty; the
Democratic–Republican [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_R._Livingston_(chancellor)"] Robert R. Livingston wrote to Madison that the treaty "sacrifices every essential
interest and prostrates the honor of our country".[95] Madison's strong opposition to the treaty led to a
permanent break with Washington, ending their friendship.[94]
Adams presidency
Washington chose to retire after serving two terms and, in advance of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1796_United_States_presidential_election"] 1796 presidential election,
Madison helped convince Jefferson to run for the presidency.[90] Despite Madison's efforts, Federalist
candidate John Adams defeated Jefferson, taking a narrow majority of the electoral vote.[96] Under the
rules of the Electoral College then in place, Jefferson became vice president because he finished with the
second-most electoral votes.[97] Madison, meanwhile, had declined to seek re-election, and he returned to
his home at Montpelier.[98] On Jefferson's advice, President Adams considered appointing Madison to an
American delegation charged with ending French attacks on American shipping, but Adams's cabinet
members strongly opposed the idea. After a diplomatic incident between France and the United States
 known as the XYZ Affair, the two countries engaged in an undeclared naval war known as the Quasi-
War.[99]
Though he was out of office, Madison remained a prominent Democratic–Republican leader in opposition
to the Adams administration.[100] During the Quasi-War, the Federalists created a standing army and passed
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts"] Alien and Sedition Acts, which were directed at French refugees engaged in American politics and
against Democratic–Republican editors.[101] Madison and Jefferson believed that the Federalists were
using the war to justify the violation of constitutional rights, and they increasingly came to view Adams as a
monarchist.[102] Both Madison and Jefferson as leaders of the Democratic–Republican party expressed the
belief that natural rights were non-negotiable even during a time of war. Madison believed that the Alien
and Sedition acts formed a dangerous precedent, giving the government the power to look past the natural
rights of its people in the name of national security.[103] In response to the Alien and Sedition Acts,
Jefferson wrote the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_and_Kentucky_Resolutions"] Kentucky Resolutions, which argued that the states had the power to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullification_(U.S._Constitution)"] nullify federal law
on the basis that the Constitution was a compact among the states. Madison rejected this view of
nullification, and his Virginia Resolutions instead urged states to respond to unjust federal laws through
interposition, a process in which a state legislature declared a law to be unconstitutional but did not take
steps to actively prevent its enforcement. Jefferson's doctrine of nullification was widely rejected, and the
incident damaged the Democratic–Republican Party as attention was shifted from the Alien and Sedition
Acts to the unpopular nullification doctrine.[104]
Page 10
In 1799, Madison won election to the Virginia legislature. At the same time, he and Jefferson planned for
Jefferson's campaign in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1800_United_States_presidential_election"] 1800 presidential election.[105] Madison issued the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report_of_1800"] Report of 1800, which
attacked the Alien and Sedition Acts as unconstitutional. The Report of 1800 held that Congress was
limited to legislating on its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_powers_(United_States)"] enumerated powers and that punishment for sedition violated freedom of speech
and freedom of the press. Jefferson embraced the report, and it became the unofficial Democratic–
Republican platform for the 1800 election.[106] With the Federalists badly divided between supporters of
Hamilton and Adams, and with news of the end of the Quasi-War not reaching the United States until after
the election, Jefferson and his ostensible running mate, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr"] Aaron Burr, defeated Adams. As Jefferson and Burr
tied in the electoral vote, the Federalist-controlled House of Representatives held a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingent_election"] contingent election to
choose between the two candidates.[107] After the House conducted dozens of inconclusive ballots,
Hamilton, who despised Burr even more than he did Jefferson, convinced several Federalist congressmen
to cast blank ballots, giving Jefferson the victory.[108]
Personal life
At a height of only five feet, four inches (163 cm), and never
weighing more than 100 pounds (45 kg), Madison became the most
diminutive president.[109] He was small in stature, had bright blue
eyes, a strong demeanor, and was known to be humorous at small
gatherings. Madison suffered from serious illnesses, nervousness,
and was often exhausted after periods of stress. He often feared for
the worst and was a hypochondriac. However, Madison was in
good health, while he lived a long life, without the common
maladies of his times.[110]  Montpelier, Madison's tobacco
plantation in Virginia
On September 15, 1794, Madison married [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolley_Madison"] Dolley Payne Todd, a
26-year-old widow of John Todd, a Quaker farmer who died
during a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever"] yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia.[111] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr"] Aaron Burr introduced Madison to her, at his request,
after Dolley had stayed in the same boardinghouse as Burr in Philadelphia. After an arranged meeting in
early 1794, the two quickly became romantically engaged and prepared for a wedding that summer, but
Dolley suffered recurring illnesses because of her exposure to yellow fever in Philadelphia. They
eventually traveled to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harewood_(West_Virginia)"] Harewood in Virginia for their wedding. Only a few close family members attended,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester,_Virginia"] Winchester Reverend [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Balmain"] Alexander Balmain pronounced them a wedded couple.[112] Madison, an
introspective individual, enjoyed a strong relationship with his wife Dolley[113] and deeply relied on his
wife to help him in dealing with social pressures that came with the politics of the day.[114] She became a
renowned figure in Washington, D.C.,  and excelled at hosting dinners and other important political
occasions.[114] Dolley helped to establish the modern image of the first lady of the United States as an
individual who takes upon a role in the social affairs of the nation.[113]
Madison never had children, but he adopted Dolley's one surviving son, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Payne_Todd"] John Payne Todd (known as
Payne), after the marriage.[98] Some of his colleagues, such as Monroe and Burr, alleged that Madison was
infertile and that his lack of offspring weighed on his thoughts, but Madison never spoke of any distress on
this matter.[115] Nonetheless, his fertility has come into questions in recent years, following a popular article
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post"] The Washington Post in 2007, in which an African-American named Bettye Kearse claimed to be a
descendant of Madison and a slave named Coreen.[116][117]
Throughout his life, he maintained a close relationship with his father James Sr., who died in 1801. At age
50, Madison inherited the large plantation of Montpelier and other possessions, including his father's
numerous slaves.[118] He had three brothers, Francis, Ambrose, and William, and three sisters, Nelly,
Sarah, and Frances, who lived to adulthood. Ambrose helped manage Montpelier for both his father and
older brother until his death in 1793.[119]

Secretary of State (1801–1809)
Despite lacking foreign policy experience, Madison was appointed as the secretary of state by
Jefferson.[120] Along with Secretary of the Treasury [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Gallatin"] Albert Gallatin, Madison became one of the two major
influences in Jefferson's Cabinet.[121] As the ascent of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon"] Napoleon in France had dulled Democratic–
 Republican enthusiasm for the French cause, Madison sought a neutral position in the ongoing Coalition
Wars between France and Britain.[122] Domestically, the Jefferson administration and the Democratic–
Republican Congress rolled back many Federalist policies; Congress quickly repealed the Alien and
Sedition Act, abolished internal taxes, and reduced the size of the army and navy.[123] Gallatin, however,
did convince Jefferson to retain the First Bank of the United States.[124] Though the Federalists were
rapidly fading away at the national level, Chief Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall"] John Marshall ensured that Federalist ideology
retained an important presence in the judiciary. In the case of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbury_v._Madison"] Marbury v. Madison, Marshall simultaneously
ruled that Madison had unjustly refused to deliver federal commissions to individuals who had been
appointed to federal positions by President Adams but who had not yet taken office, but that the Supreme
Court did not have jurisdiction over the case. Most importantly, Marshall's opinion established the principle
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review"] judicial review.[125]
By the time Jefferson took office, Americans had
settled as far west as the Mississippi River, though
vast pockets of American land remained vacant or
inhabited only [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States"] Native Americans. Jefferson
believed that western expansion played an
important role in furthering his vision of a
republic of yeoman farmers, and he hoped to
acquire the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"] Spanish territory of Louisiana, which
was located to the west of the Mississippi
River.[126] Early in Jefferson's presidency, the
administration learned that Spain planned to
retrocede the Louisiana territory to France, raising
fears of French encroachment on U.S.
territory.[127] In 1802, Jefferson and Madison sent
Monroe to France to negotiate the purchase of
 New Orleans, which controlled access to the

Mississippi River and thus was immensely
important to the farmers of the American frontier.
Rather than selling merely New Orleans, Napoleon's government, having already given up on plans to
establish a new French empire in the Americas, offered to sell the entire Territory of Louisiana. Despite
lacking explicit authorization from Jefferson, Monroe, along with ambassador Livingston, negotiated the
 Louisiana Purchase, in which France sold over 800,000 square miles (2,100,000 square kilometers) of land
in exchange for $15 million ($271 million adjusted for inflation in 2021).[128]
Despite the time-sensitive nature of negotiations with the French, Jefferson was concerned about the
constitutionality of the Louisiana Purchase, and he privately favored introducing a constitutional
amendment explicitly authorizing Congress to acquire new territories. Madison convinced Jefferson to
refrain from proposing the amendment, and the administration ultimately submitted the Louisiana Purchase
without an accompanying constitutional amendment.[129] Unlike Jefferson, Madison was not seriously
concerned with the Louisiana Purchase's constitutionality. He believed that the circumstances did not
warrant a strict interpretation of the Constitution because the expansion was in the country's best
interest.[130] The Senate quickly ratified the treaty providing for the purchase, and the House, with equal
alacrity, passed enabling legislation.[131] The Jefferson administration argued that the purchase had
included the Spanish territory of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Florida"] West Florida, but France and Spain both held that West Florida was not
Page 12
included in the purchase.[132] Monroe attempted to purchase clear
title to West Florida and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Florida"] East Florida from Spain, but the Spanish,
outraged by Jefferson's claims to West Florida, refused to
negotiate.[133]
Early in his tenure, Jefferson was able to maintain cordial relations
with both France and Britain, but relations with Britain deteriorated
after 1805.[134] The British ended their policy of tolerance towards
American shipping and began seizing American goods headed for
French ports.[135] They also [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressment"] impressed American sailors, some of
whom had originally defected from the British navy, and some of
whom had never been British subjects.[136] In response to the
attacks, Congress passed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-importation_Act"] Non-importation Act, which restricted
many, but not all, British imports.[135] Tensions with Britain
heightened due to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake%E2%80%93Leopard_affair"] Chesapeake–Leopard affair, a June 1807
naval confrontation between American and British naval forces,
while the French also began attacking American shipping.[137] 
James Madison by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Stuart"] Gilbert Stuart,
c. 1805–1807
Madison believed that economic pressure could force the British to
 end attacks on American shipping, and he and Jefferson convinced Congress to pass the Embargo Act of
1807, which banned all exports to foreign nations.[138] The embargo proved ineffective, unpopular, and
difficult to enforce, especially in New England.[139] In March 1809, Congress replaced the embargo with
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Intercourse_Act_(1809)"] Non-Intercourse Act, which allowed trade with nations other than Britain and France.[140]
1808 presidential election
Speculation regarding Madison's potential succession of Jefferson
commenced early in Jefferson's first term. Madison's status in the
party was damaged by his association with the embargo, which
was unpopular throughout the country and especially in the
Northeast.[141] With the Federalists collapsing as a national party
after 1800, the chief opposition to Madison's candidacy came from
other members of the Democratic–Republican Party.[142] Madison
became the target of attacks from Congressman [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Randolph_of_Roanoke"] John Randolph, a
leader of a faction of the party known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertium_quids"] tertium quids.[143]
Randolph recruited Monroe, who had felt betrayed by the
administration's rejection of the proposed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe%E2%80%93Pinkney_Treaty"] Monroe–Pinkney Treaty
with Britain, to challenge Madison for leadership of the party.[144] 1808 electoral vote results
Many Northerners, meanwhile, hoped that Vice President Clinton
could unseat Madison as Jefferson's successor.[145] Despite this
 opposition, Madison won his party's presidential nomination at the January 1808 congressional nominating
caucus.[146] The Federalist Party mustered little strength outside New England, and Madison easily
defeated Federalist candidate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cotesworth_Pinckney"] Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.[147]
Presidency (1809–1817)
Taking office and cabinet
Page 13
On March 4, 1809, Madison took the oath of office and was
inaugurated president. Unlike Jefferson, who enjoyed political
unity and support, Madison faced political opposition from Monroe
and Clinton. Additionally, the Federalist Party had resurged owing
to opposition to the embargo. Aside from his planned nomination
of Gallatin for secretary of state, the remaining members of
Madison's Cabinet were chosen for the purposes of national interest
and political harmony, and according to historians Ketcham and
Rutland were largely unremarkable or incompetent.[148][149]
Madison immediately faced opposition to his planned nomination
of Secretary of the Treasury Gallatin as secretary of state. Madison
chose not to submit the nomination for the advice and consent of
Congress but instead kept Gallatin in the Treasury Department.[150]
With Gallatin's nomination now made moot by retaining him as the
secretary of the treasury, Madison settled for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smith_(Cabinet_member)"] Robert Smith, the
brother of Maryland Senator Samuel Smith, to be the secretary of
state.[149] For the next two years, Madison performed most of the
job of the secretary of state due to Smith's incompetence. After [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Edwin"] James Madison engraving by David
bitter party contention, Madison finally replaced Smith with
Monroe in April 1811.[151][152] With a Cabinet full of those he

distrusted, Madison rarely called Cabinet meetings and instead
frequently consulted with Gallatin alone.[153] Early in his presidency, Madison sought to continue
Jefferson's policies of low taxes and a reduction of the national debt.[154] In 1811, Congress allowed the
charter of the First Bank of the United States to lapse after Madison declined to take a strong stance on the
issue.[155]
War of 1812
Prelude to war
Congress had repealed the embargo shortly before Madison became president, but troubles with the British
and French continued.[156] Madison settled on a new strategy designed to pit the British and French against
each other, offering to trade with whichever country would end their attacks against American shipping.
The gambit almost succeeded, but negotiations with the British collapsed in mid-1809.[157] Seeking to split
the Americans and British, Napoleon offered to end French attacks on American shipping so long as the
United States punished any countries that did not similarly end restrictions on trade.[158] Madison accepted
Napoleon's proposal in the hope that it would convince the British to finally end their policy of commercial
warfare, but the British refused to change their policies, and the French reneged on their promise and
continued to attack American shipping.[159]
With sanctions and other policies having failed, Madison determined that war with Britain was the only
remaining option.[160] Many Americans called for a "second war of independence" to restore honor and
 stature to the new nation, and an angry public elected a "war hawk" Congress, led by Henry Clay and John
C. Calhoun.[161] With Britain in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars, many Americans including Madison
believed that the United States could easily capture Canada, at which point the U.S. could use Canada as a
bargaining chip for all other disputes or simply retain control of it.[162] On June 1, 1812, Madison asked
Congress for a declaration of war, stating that the United States could no longer tolerate Britain's "state of
war against the United States". The declaration of war was passed along sectional and party lines, with
opposition to the declaration coming from Federalists and from some Democratic–Republicans in the
Page 14
Northeast.[163] In the years prior to the war, Jefferson and Madison had reduced the size of the military,
leaving the country with a military force consisting mostly of poorly trained militia members.[164] Madison
asked Congress to quickly put the country "into an armor and an attitude demanded by the crisis,"
specifically recommending expansion of the army and navy.[165]
Military action
Madison and his advisers initially believed the war would be a
quick American victory.[162][166] Having misguided confidence,
Madison ordered a three front invasion of Canada, starting at
Detroit, designed to defeat British control around American held
 Fort Niagara and destroy the British supply lines from Montreal.
These actions would give leverage for British concessions on the
Atlantic high seas.[166] However, without a standing American
army, Madison believed state militias would rally to the flag and
invade Canada. The American governors in the Northeast failed to
cooperate, and the militias either sat out the war or refused to leave
their respective states.[167] As a result, Madison's first Canadian
campaign ended in failure. The British army was more organized,

used professional soldiers, and allied with Tecumseh. On August
16, Major General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hull"] William Hull, timidly fearing Indian attack, quickly surrendered to British and Native
American forces at Detroit.[166] On October 13, a separate force from the United States was defeated at
 Queenton Heights.[168][166] Commanding General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dearborn"] Henry Dearborn, hampered by mutinous New England
infantry, retreated to winter quarters near Albany, after failing to destroy Montreal's vulnerable British
supply lines.[166] Lacking adequate revenue to fund the war, the Madison administration was forced to rely
on high-interest loans furnished by bankers based in New York City and Philadelphia.[169]
In leading up to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1812_United_States_presidential_election"] 1812 presidential election, held during the early stages of the War of 1812, the poorly-
attended 1812 Democratic-Republican congressional caucus met in May 1812, and Madison was re-
nominated without opposition.[170] A dissident group of New York Democratic-Republicans nominated
 DeWitt Clinton, the Lieutenant Governor of New York and the nephew of recently deceased Vice President
George Clinton, to oppose Madison in the 1812 election. This faction of Democratic-Republicans hoped to
unseat the president by forging a coalition among Republicans opposed to the coming war, Democratic-
Republicans angry with Madison for not moving more decisively toward war, northerners weary of the
 Virginia dynasty and southern control of the White House, and disgruntled [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England"] New Englanders who wanted
almost anyone over Madison. Dismayed about their prospects of beating Madison, a group of top
Federalists met with Clinton's supporters to discuss a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_alliance"] unification strategy. Difficult as it was for them to join
forces, they nominated Clinton for President and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Ingersoll"] Jared Ingersoll, a Philadelphia lawyer, for vice
president.[171] Hoping to shore up his support in the Northeast, where the War of 1812 was unpopular,
Madison selected Governor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbridge_Gerry"] Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts as his running mate.[172] Despite the
maneuverings of Clinton and the Federalists, Madison won re-election, though by the narrowest margin of
any election since the election of 1800. He received 128 electoral votes to 89 for Clinton.[173] Federalists
made gains in most states outside of the South, but Pennsylvania's support for Madison ensured that the
incumbent won a majority of the electoral vote.[174] Clinton won most of the Northeast, but Madison won
the election by sweeping the South and the West and winning the key state of Pennsylvania.[175]
After the disastrous start to the War of 1812, Madison accepted Russia's invitation to arbitrate the war, and
he sent a delegation led by Gallatin and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams"] John Quincy Adams (the son of former President John Adams) to
Europe to negotiate a peace treaty.[162] While Madison worked to end the war, the United States
experienced some impressive naval successes, boosting American morale, by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constitution"] USS Constitution, and
other warships.[176][166] With a victory at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Erie"] Battle of Lake Erie, the U.S. crippled the supply and

reinforcement of British military forces in the western theater of the
war.[177] In the aftermath of the Battle of Lake Erie, General
 William Henry Harrison defeated the forces of the British and of
 Tecumseh's Confederacy at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Thames"] Battle of the Thames. The death of
 Tecumseh in that battle marked the permanent end of armed Native
American resistance in the Old Northwest and any hope of a united
Indian nation.[178] In March 1814, General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson"] Andrew Jackson broke
the resistance of the British-allied [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscogee"] Muscogee in the Old Southwest
with his victory at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Horseshoe_Bend_(1814)"] Battle of Horseshoe Bend.[179] Despite those
successes, the British continued to repel American attempts to
invade Canada, and a British force captured [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Fort_Niagara"] Fort Niagara and
burned the American city of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York"] Buffalo in late 1813.[180]
 In August 1814, the British landed a large force off the Chesapeake
Bay and routed Winder's army at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bladensburg"] Battle of Bladensburg.[181]
The Madisons escaped capture, fleeing to Virginia by horseback, in
the aftermath of the battle, but the British [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_Washington"] burned Washington and
other buildings.[182][183] The charred remains of the capital by the
British were a humiliating defeat for Madison and America.[184]
The British army next moved on Baltimore, but the U.S. repelled
the British attack in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Baltimore"] Battle of Baltimore, and the British army
departed from the Chesapeake region in September.[185] That same
month, U.S. forces repelled a British invasion from Canada with a
victory at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Plattsburgh"] Battle of Plattsburgh.[186] The British public began to
turn against the war in North America, and British leaders began to
look for a quick exit from the conflict.[187] 
Battle of New Orleans. 1815
 In January 1815, an American force under General Jackson defeated the British at the Battle of New
Orleans.[188] Just over a month later, Madison learned that his negotiators had reached the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Ghent"] Treaty of Ghent,
ending the war without major concessions by either side. Madison quickly sent the Treaty of Ghent to the
Senate, and the Senate ratified the treaty on February 16, 1815.[189] Although the result of the war was
inconclusive, to most Americans, the quick succession of events at the end of the war, including the
burning of the capital, the Battle of New Orleans, and the Treaty of Ghent, appeared as though American
valor at New Orleans had forced the British to surrender. This view, while inaccurate, strongly contributed
to a feeling of post-war euphoria that bolstered Madison's reputation as president. The Indian people lost
the most, including their land and independence.[190] Napoleon's defeat at the June 1815 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waterloo"] Battle of Waterloo
brought a final close to the Napoleonic Wars, ending the danger of attacks on American shipping by British
and French forces.[191]
Postwar period and decline of the Federalist opposition
The postwar period of Madison's second term saw the transition into the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_Good_Feelings"] Era of Good Feelings," as the
Federalists ceased to act as an effective opposition party.[192] During the war, delegates from the states of
New England held the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford_Convention"] Hartford Convention, where they asked for several amendments to the
Constitution.[193] Though the Hartford Convention did not explicitly call for the secession of New
England,[194] the Hartford Convention became a political millstone around the Federalist Party as
Americans celebrated what they saw as a successful "second war of independence" from Britain.[195]
Madison hastened the decline of the Federalists by adopting several programs he had previously opposed,
weakening the ideological divisions between the two major parties.[196]

Recognizing the difficulties of financing the war and the necessity of an institution to regulate the currency,
Madison proposed the re-establishment of a national bank. He also called for increased spending on the
army and the navy, a tariff designed to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism"] protect American goods from foreign competition, and a
 constitutional amendment authorizing the federal government to fund the construction of internal
improvements such as roads and canals. His initiatives were opposed by strict constructionists such as John
Randolph, who stated that Madison's proposals "out-Hamiltons Alexander Hamilton".[197] Responding to
Madison's proposals, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_United_States_Congress"] 14th Congress compiled one of the most productive legislative records up to that
point in history.[198] Congress granted the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States"] Second Bank of the United States a twenty-five-year charter[197]
and passed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_1816"] Tariff of 1816, which set high import duties for all goods that were produced outside the
United States.[198] Madison approved federal spending on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_Road"] Cumberland Road, which provided a link to
the country's western lands,[199] but in his last act before leaving office, he blocked further federal spending
on internal improvements by vetoing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonus_Bill_of_1817"] Bonus Bill of 1817. In making the veto, Madison argued that the
 General Welfare Clause did not broadly authorize federal spending on internal improvements.[200]
Native American policy
Upon becoming president, Madison said the federal government's
duty was to convert Native Americans by the "participation of the
improvements of which the human mind and manners are
susceptible in a civilized state".[154] On September 30, 1809, a little
more than six months into his first term, Madison agreed to the
Treaty of Fort Wayne, negotiated and signed by Indiana Territory
Governor Harrison. The treaty began with "James Madison,
President of the United States," on the first sentence of the first
paragraph.[201] The American Indian tribes were compensated
$5,200 ($109,121.79 for year 2020) in goods and $500 and $250
annual subsidies to the various tribes, for 3 million acres of land 
Battle of Tippecanoe
November 7, 1811
(approximately 12,140 square kilometers).[202] The treaty angered
Shawnee leader Tecumseh, who said, "Sell a country! Why not sell the air, the clouds and the great sea, as
well as the earth?"[203] Harrison responded that the Miami tribe was the owner of the land and could sell it
to whomever they wished.[204]
Like Jefferson, Madison had a paternalistic attitude toward American Indians, encouraging the men to give
up hunting and become farmers.[205] Madison believed the adoption of European-style agriculture would
help Native Americans assimilate the values of British–U.S. civilization. As pioneers and settlers moved
West into large tracts of Cherokee, Choctaw, Creek, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickasaw"] Chickasaw territory, Madison ordered the U.S.
Army to protect Native lands from intrusion by settlers, to the chagrin of his military commander Andrew
Jackson, who wanted Madison to ignore Indian pleas to stop the invasion of their lands.[206] Tensions
mounted between the United States and Tecumseh over the 1809 Treaty of Fort Wayne, which ultimately
led to Tecumseh's alliance with the British and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tippecanoe"] Battle of Tippecanoe, on November 7, 1811, in the
Northwest Territory.[206][207] Tecumseh was defeated and Indians were pushed off their tribal lands,
replaced entirely by white settlers.[206] [207] In addition to the Battle of the Thames and the Battle of
Horseshoe Bend, other American Indian battles took place, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoria_War"] Peoria War, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creek_War"] Creek War.
Settled by General Jackson, the Creek War added 20 million acres of land to the United States
(approximately 80,937 square kilometers) in Georgia and Alabama, by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Fort_Jackson"] Treaty of Fort Jackson on
August 9, 1814.[208]
Privately, Madison did not believe American Indians could be civilized. Madison believed that Native
Americans may have been unwilling to make "the transition from the hunter, or even the herdsman state, to
the agriculture".[203] Madison feared that Native Americans had too great an influence on the settlers they
Page 17
interacted with, who in his view were "irresistibly attracted by that complete liberty, that freedom from
bonds, obligations, duties, that absence of care and anxiety which characterize the savage state". In March
1816, Madison's Secretary of War [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Crawford"] William Crawford advocated for the government to encourage
intermarriages between Native Americans and whites as a way of assimilating the former. This prompted
public outrage and exacerbated anti-Indigenous bigotry among white Americans, as seen in hostile letters
sent to Madison, who remained publicly silent on the issue.[203]
Election of 1816
In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1816_United_States_presidential_election"] 1816 presidential election, Madison and Jefferson both favored the candidacy of Secretary of State
James Monroe and he defeated Secretary of War William H. Crawford in the party's congressional
nominating caucus. As the Federalist Party continued to collapse as a national party, Monroe easily
defeated Federalist candidate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufus_King"] Rufus King in the 1816 election.[209] Madison left office as a popular
president; former president Adams wrote that Madison had "acquired more glory, and established more
union, than all his three predecessors, Washington, Adams, and Jefferson, put together".[210]
Post-presidency (1817–1836)
When Madison left office in 1817 at age 65, he retired to
Montpelier, his tobacco plantation in Orange County, Virginia, not
far from Jefferson's Monticello. As with both Washington and
Jefferson, Madison left the presidency a poorer man than when
elected. His plantation experienced a steady financial collapse, due
to the continued price declines in tobacco and also due to his
stepson's mismanagement.[211]
In his retirement, Madison occasionally became involved in public
affairs, advising Andrew Jackson and other presidents.[212] He
remained out of the public debate over the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Compromise"] Missouri Compromise,
though he privately complained about the North's opposition to the
extension of slavery.[213] Madison had warm relations with all four
of the major candidates in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1824_United_States_presidential_election"] 1824 presidential election, but, like
 Jefferson, largely stayed out of the race.[214] During Jackson's
presidency, Madison publicly disavowed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullification_Crisis"] Nullification 
Portrait of James Madison c. 1821,
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Stuart"] Gilbert Stuart
movement and argued that no state had the right to secede.[215]
 Madison also helped Jefferson establish the University of
Virginia.[216] In 1826, after the death of Jefferson, Madison was appointed as the second rector of the
university. He retained the position as college chancellor for ten years until his death in 1836.
In 1829, at the age of 78, Madison was chosen as a representative to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Constitutional_Convention_of_1829%E2%80%931830"] Virginia Constitutional Convention
for revision of the commonwealth's constitution. It was his last appearance as a statesman. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apportionment_(politics)"] Apportionment
was the central issue at the convention. The western districts of Virginia complained that they were
underrepresented because the state constitution apportioned voting districts by county. The increased
population in the Piedmont and western parts of the state were not proportionately represented by delegates
in the legislature. Western reformers also wanted to extend suffrage to all white men, in place of the
prevailing property ownership requirement. Madison tried in vain to effect a compromise. Eventually,
suffrage rights were extended to renters as well as landowners, but the eastern planters refused to adopt
citizen population apportionment. They added slaves held as property to the population count, to maintain a
Page 18
permanent majority in both houses of the legislature, arguing that there must be a balance between
population and property represented. Madison was disappointed at the failure of Virginians to resolve the
issue more equitably.[217]
In his later years, Madison became highly concerned about his historic legacy. He resorted to modifying
letters and other documents in his possession, changing days and dates, adding and deleting words and
sentences, and shifting characters. By the time he had reached his late seventies, Madison's self-editing of
his own archived letters and older materials had become almost an obsession. As an example, he edited a
letter written to Jefferson criticizing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_du_Motier,_Marquis_de_Lafayette"] Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette—Madison not only inked out
original passages, but even forged Jefferson's handwriting.[218] Historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_R._McCoy"] Drew R. McCoy wrote that,
"During the final six years of his life, amid a sea of personal [financial] troubles that were threatening to
engulf him ... At times mental agitation issued in physical collapse. For the better part of a year in 1831 and
1832 he was bedridden, if not silenced ... Literally sick with anxiety, he began to despair of his ability to
make himself understood by his fellow citizens."[219]
Death
Madison's health slowly deteriorated. In a coincidence, the calendar
date of the Fourth of July was the day of the year on which former
presidents Jefferson, Adams, and Monroe had all died. In his final
week, his doctors advised Madison to take stimulants which might
prolong his life to July 4, 1836. However, Madison refused.[220]
He died of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestive_heart_failure"] congestive heart failure at Montpelier on the morning of
June 28, 1836, at the age of 85.[221] By one common account of
his final moments, he was given his breakfast, which he tried eating 
Madison's gravestone at Montpelier
but was unable to swallow. His favorite niece, who sat by to keep
him company, asked him, "What is the matter, Uncle James?" Madison died immediately after he replied,
"Nothing more than a change of mind,  my dear."[222] He is buried in the family cemetery at
Montpelier.[211] He was one of the last prominent members of the Revolutionary War generation to
die.[212] His [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_will_and_testament"] last will and testament left significant sums to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Colonization_Society"] American Colonization Society, Princeton,
and the University of Virginia, as well as $30,000 ($897 thousand corrected for inflation in 2021) to his
wife, Dolley. Left with a smaller sum than Madison had intended, Dolley suffered financial troubles until
her death in 1849.[223]
Political and religious views
Federalism
During his first stint in Congress in the 1780s, Madison came to
favor amending the Articles of Confederation to provide for a
stronger central government.[224] In the 1790s, he led the
opposition to Hamilton's centralizing policies and the Alien and
Sedition Acts.[225] According to historian Ron Chernow,
Madison's support of the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions in
the 1790s "was a breathtaking evolution for a man who had
pleaded at the Constitutional Convention that the federal
government should possess a veto over state laws".[101] Historian
 Gordon S. Wood says that Lance Banning, as in his Sacred Fire

Liberty: James Madison and the
Founding of the Federal Republic,

-liberty-james-madison), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-SPAN"] C-SPAN
Page 19
of Liberty (1995), is the "only present-day scholar to maintain that Madison did not change his views in the
1790s".[226] During and after the War of 1812, Madison came to support several policies he had opposed
in the 1790s, including the national bank, a strong navy, and direct taxes.[227]
Wood notes that many historians struggle to understand Madison, but Wood looks at him in the terms of
Madison's own times—as a nationalist but one with a different conception of nationalism from that of the
Federalists.[226] Gary Rosen uses other approaches to suggest Madison's consistency.[228]
Religion
Although baptized as an Anglican and educated by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterianism"] Presbyterian clergymen,[229] young Madison was an
avid reader of English [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism"] deist tracts.[230] As an adult, Madison paid little attention to religious matters.
Though most historians have found little indication of his religious leanings after he left college,[231] some
scholars indicate he leaned toward deism.[232][233] Others maintain that Madison accepted Christian tenets
and formed his outlook on life with a Christian world view.[234]
Regardless of his own religious beliefs, Madison believed in religious liberty, and he advocated for
Virginia's disestablishment of the Anglican Church throughout the late 1770s and 1780s.[235] He also
opposed the appointments of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain"] chaplains for Congress and the armed forces, arguing that the appointments
produce religious exclusion as well as political disharmony.[236] In 1819, Madison said, "The number, the
industry, and the morality of the priesthood & the devotion of the people have been manifestly increased by
the total separation of the Church from the State."[237]
Slavery
Madison grew up on a plantation that made use of slave labor and
he viewed slavery as a necessary part of the Southern economy,
though he was troubled by the instability of a society that depended
on a large slave population.[238] Although Madison had supported
a republican form of government, he believed that slavery had
caused the South to become aristocratic. Madison believed that
slaves were human property, while he opposed slavery
intellectually.[239]
Madison initially opposed the 20-year ban on ending the
international slave trade. However, he eventually accepted it as a
necessary compromise to get the South to ratify the
constitution.[240] He also proposed that apportionment in the House
of Representatives be allocated by the sum of each state's free Portrait of Madison, age 82, c. 1833
population and slave population, eventually leading to the adoption
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-fifths_Compromise"] Three-fifths Compromise.[241] Madison supported the
extension of slavery into the West during the Missouri crisis of 1819–1821.[242] Madison believed that
former slaves were unlikely to successfully integrate into Southern society, and in the late 1780s, he became
interested in the idea of African-Americans establishing colonies in Africa.[243] Madison served as the
president of the American Colonization Society, which founded the settlement of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia"] Liberia for former
slaves.[244]
Madison was referred to as a “garden-variety slaveholder" by historian Elizabeth Dowling Taylor. Madison
withheld excessive cruelty to slaves to avoid criticism from peers, and to curb slave revolts. Madison
worked his slaves from dawn to dusk, six days a week, getting Sundays off for rest.[245] By 1801,
Page 20
Madison's slave population at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montpelier_(Orange,_Virginia)"] Montpelier was slightly over 100. During the 1820s and 1830s, Madison was
forced by debts to sell land and slaves. In 1836, at the time of Madison's death, he owned 36 taxable
slaves.[246] Madison did not free any of his slaves either during his lifetime or in his will.[242][239]
Legacy
Historical reputation
Madison is widely regarded as one of the most important [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States"] Founding Fathers of the United States. Historian
J. C. A. Stagg writes that "in some ways—because he was on the winning side of every important issue
facing the young nation from 1776 to 1816—Madison was the most successful and possibly the most
influential of all the Founding Fathers."[247] Though he helped found a major political party and served as
the fourth president, his legacy has largely been defined by his contributions to the Constitution; even in his
own life he was hailed as the "Father of the Constitution".[248] Law professor Noah Feldman writes that
Madison "invented and theorized the modern ideal of an expanded, federal constitution that combines local
self-government with an overarching national order".[249] Feldman adds that Madison's "model of liberty-
protecting constitutional government" is "the most influential American idea in global political
history".[249]
Polls of historians and political scientists tend to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States"] rank Madison as an above-average president. A 2018 poll
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Political_Science_Association"] American Political Science Association's Presidents and Executive Politics section ranked Madison
as the twelfth best president.[250] Historian Gordon Wood commends Madison for his steady leadership
during the war and resolve to avoid expanding the president's power, noting one contemporary's
observation that the war was conducted "without one trial for treason, or even one prosecution for
 libel".[251] Nonetheless, many historians have criticized Madison's tenure as president.[252] Henry Steele
Commager and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_B._Morris"] Richard B. Morris in 1968 said the conventional view of Madison was as an "incapable
President" who "mismanaged an unnecessary war".[253] A 2006 poll of historians ranked Madison's failure
to prevent the War of 1812 as the sixth-worst mistake made by a sitting president.[254]
Historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Wills"] Garry Wills wrote,
"Madison's claim on our admiration does not rest on a perfect consistency, any more than it
rests on his presidency. He has other virtues. ... As a framer and defender of the Constitution
he had no peer. ... The finest part of Madison's performance as president was his concern for
the preserving of the Constitution. ... No man could do everything for the country—not even
Washington. Madison did more than most, and did some things better than any. That was quite
enough."[255]
Memorials
 Montpelier, the Madison family's plantation, has been designated a National Historic Landmark. The James
Madison Memorial Building is a building of the United States [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress"] Library of Congress and serves as the official
memorial to Madison.[256] In 1986, Congress created the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison_Memorial_Fellowship_Foundation"] James Madison Memorial Fellowship Foundation
as part of the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution.[257] Several counties and communities have been
named for Madison, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_County,_Alabama"] Madison County, Alabama, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin"] Madison, Wisconsin. Other things named
 for Madison include Madison Square, James Madison University, and the USS James
Madison.[258][259][260][261]

Notes
a. Vice President Clinton and Vice President Gerry both
died in office. Neither was replaced for the remainder of
their respective terms, as the Constitution did not have a
provision for filling a vice presidential vacancy prior to
the adoption of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967.
b. ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates"] O.S. March 5, 1750)
c. After the ratification of the Articles of Confederation in
1781, the Second Continental Congress became the
 Congress of the Confederation.[26]
d. Portions of the Bill of Rights would later be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incorporation_of_the_Bill_of_Rights"] incorporated

Amendment. The other unratified amendment, known as
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Apportionment_Amendment"] Congressional Apportionment Amendment, is
technically still pending before the states.[79]
f. The Democratic–Republican Party was often referred to
as the "Republican Party". It was a separate entity from
the later [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"] Republican Party, which was founded in the
1850s.
