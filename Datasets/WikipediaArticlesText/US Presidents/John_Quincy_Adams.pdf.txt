John Quincy Adams
John Quincy Adams ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈkwɪnzi/ (  listen);[a] July 11, 1767
– February 23, 1848) was an American statesman,
diplomat, lawyer, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarist"] diarist who served as the 6th
 president of the United States, from 1825 to 1829. He
 previously served as the 8th United States Secretary of
State from 1817 to 1825. During his long diplomatic and
political career, Adams also served as an ambassador, and
 as a member of the United States Senate and House of
Representatives representing Massachusetts. He was the
eldest son of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams"] John Adams, who served as the second
 president of the United States from 1797 to 1801, and First
Lady [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail_Adams"] Abigail Adams. Initially a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party"] Federalist like his father, he
won election to the presidency as a member of the
 Democratic-Republican Party, and in the mid-1830s
became affiliated with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)"] Whig Party. 
John Quincy Adams
Born in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braintree,_Massachusetts"] Braintree, Massachusetts[3] (now part of the town
of Quincy), Adams spent much of his youth in Europe,
where his father served as a diplomat. After returning to the
United States, Adams established a successful legal practice
in Boston. In 1794, President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"] George Washington
appointed Adams as the U.S. ambassador to the
Netherlands, and Adams would serve in high-ranking
diplomatic posts until 1801, when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"] Thomas Jefferson took
office as president. Federalist leaders in Massachusetts
arranged for Adams's election to the United States Senate
in 1802, but Adams broke with the Federalist Party over
foreign policy and was denied re-election. In 1809,
President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison, a member of the Democratic-
Republican Party, appointed Adams as the U.S.
ambassador to Russia. Adams held diplomatic posts for the
duration of Madison's presidency, and he served as part of
 the American delegation that negotiated an end to the War
of 1812. In 1817, President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe"] James Monroe selected Adams
as his Secretary of State. In that role, Adams negotiated the
 Adams–Onís Treaty, which provided for the American
acquisition of Florida. He also helped formulate the
 Monroe Doctrine, which became a key tenet of U.S.
foreign policy. In 1818, Adams was elected a member of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Philosophical_Society"] American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia.[4]
 Adams, Andrew Jackson, William H. Crawford, and Henry
Clay — all members of the Democratic-Republican Party

Representatives held a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1824_United_States_presidential_election#1825_contingent_election"] contingent election, which Adams
won with the support of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives"] Speaker of the House Clay, whom
Adams would go on to controversially appoint as his
 Secretary of State. As president, Adams called for an
 ambitious agenda that included federally funded
infrastructure projects, the establishment of a national
 university, and engagement with the countries of Latin
America, but Congress refused to pass many of his
initiatives. During Adams's presidency, the Democratic-
 Republican Party split into two major camps: the National
Republican Party, which supported President Adams, and
Andrew Jackson's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"] Democratic Party. The Democrats
proved to be more effective political organizers than Adams
and his National Republican supporters, and Jackson
soundly defeated Adams in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1828_United_States_presidential_election"] 1828 presidential election,
making Adams the second president to fail to win re-
election (his father being the first).
Rather than retiring from public service, Adams won
election to the House of Representatives, where he would
serve from 1831 until his death in 1848. He remains the
only former president to be elected to the chamber. After
narrowly losing his bids for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Massachusetts"] Governor of Massachusetts and
Senate re-election, Adams joined the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Masonic_Party"] Anti-Masonic Party in
the early 1830s before joining the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)"] Whig Party, which
united those opposed to President Jackson. During his time
in Congress, Adams became increasingly critical of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States"] slavery
and of the Southern leaders who he believed controlled the
Democratic Party. He was particularly opposed to the
 annexation of Texas and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War"] Mexican–American War,
 which he saw as a war to extend slavery and its political
grip on Congress. He also led the repeal of the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_rule_(United_States)"] gag rule",
which had prevented the House of Representatives from
debating petitions to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States"] abolish slavery. Historians concur that
Adams was one of the greatest diplomats and secretaries of
state in American history; they [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States"] typically rank him as an
average president, as he had an ambitious agenda but could
not get it passed by Congress.

Early life, education, and early career
John Quincy Adams was born on July 11, 1767, to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams"] John and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail_Adams"] Abigail Adams (née Smith) in a part of
Braintree, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Massachusetts"] Massachusetts that is now Quincy.[5] He was named after his mother's maternal grandfather,
 Colonel John Quincy, after whom Quincy, Massachusetts, is named, who died two days after Adams's
Page 4
birth.[6] Young Adams was educated by private tutors – his cousin
James Thaxter and his father's law clerk, Nathan Rice.[7] He soon
exhibited literary skills, and in 1779 he started a diary that he kept
until just before he died in 1848.[8] Until the age of ten, Adams
grew up on the family farm in Braintree, largely in the care of his
mother. Though frequently absent because of his participation in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution"] American Revolution, John Adams maintained a
correspondence with his son, encouraging him to read works by
authors such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides"] Thucydides and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Grotius"] Hugo Grotius.[9] With his father's
encouragement, Adams would also translate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity"] classical authors such
as Virgil, Horace, Plutarch, and Aristotle.[10] 
 Adams's birthplace in Quincy,
Massachusetts
In 1778, Adams and his father departed for Europe, where John
Adams would serve as part of American diplomatic missions in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_France"] France and the Netherlands.[11] During this
 period, Adams studied law, French, Greek, and Latin, and attended several schools, including Leiden
University.[12][13] In 1781, Adams traveled to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg"] Saint Petersburg, Russia, where he served as the secretary to
the American diplomat, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Dana"] Francis Dana.[14] He returned to the Netherlands in 1783 and accompanied his
father to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain"] Great Britain in 1784.[15] Though Adams enjoyed Europe, he and his family decided he needed to
return to the United States to complete his education and eventually launch a political career.[16]
Adams returned to the United States in 1785 and earned admission as a member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_(education_year)"] junior class of
 Harvard College the following year. He joined [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_Beta_Kappa"] Phi Beta Kappa and excelled academically, graduating
second in his class in 1787.[17] After graduating from Harvard, he [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_law"] studied law with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophilus_Parsons"] Theophilus Parsons in
 Newburyport, Massachusetts, from 1787 to 1789.[18] Adams initially opposed the ratification of the United
States Constitution, but he ultimately came to accept the document, and in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1789_United_States_presidential_election"] 1789 his father was elected as
the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States"] Vice President of the United States.[19] In 1790, Adams opened his own legal practice in Boston.
Despite some early struggles, he was successful as an attorney and established financial independence from
his parents.[20]
Early political career (1793–1817)
Early diplomatic career and marriage
Adams initially avoided becoming involved in
politics, instead focusing on building his legal
career. In 1791, he wrote a  series of
pseudonymously published essays arguing that
Britain provided a better governmental model
than France. Two years later, he published
 another series of essays attacking Edmond-
Charles Genêt, a French diplomat who sought
to undermine President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"] George Washington's
 policy of neutrality in the French Revolutionary
Wars.[21] In 1794, Washington appointed
 Adams as the U.S. ambassador to the
Netherlands. Adams considered declining the
role, but ultimately took the position on the

advice of his father.[22] While abroad, Adams
continued to urge neutrality, arguing that the United States would benefit economically by staying out of
the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars.[23] His chief duty as the ambassador to the Netherlands was to
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil"]
Page 5
secure and maintain loans essential to U.S. finances. On his way to the Netherlands, he met with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay"] John Jay,
who was then negotiating the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Treaty"] Jay Treaty with Great Britain. Adams supported the Jay Treaty, but it proved
 unpopular with many in the United States, contributing to a growing partisan split between the Federalist
Party of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party"] Democratic-Republican Party of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"] Thomas Jefferson.[24]
Adams spent the winter of 1795–1796 in London, where he met [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisa_Adams"] Louisa Catherine Johnson, the second
daughter of American merchant Joshua Johnson. In April 1796, Louisa accepted Adams's proposal of
marriage. Adams's parents disapproved of his decision to marry a woman who had grown up in England,
but he informed his parents that he would not reconsider his decision.[25] Adams initially wanted to delay
his wedding to Louisa until he returned to the United States, but they married in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Hallows-by-the-Tower"] All Hallows-by-the-Tower
in July 1797.[26][b] Shortly after the wedding, Joshua Johnson fled England to escape his creditors, and
Adams did not receive the dowry that Johnson had promised him, much to the embarrassment of Louisa.
Adams noted in his own diary that he had no regrets about his decision to marry Louisa.[28]
In 1796, Washington appointed Adams as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Portugal"] U.S. ambassador to Portugal.[29] Later that year, John
Adams defeated Jefferson in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1796_United_States_presidential_election"] 1796 presidential election. When the elder Adams became president, he
appointed his son as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Germany"] U.S. ambassador to Prussia.[30] Though concerned that his appointment would be
criticized as nepotistic, Adams accepted the position and traveled to the Prussian capital of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin"] Berlin with his
wife and his younger brother, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Boylston_Adams_(1772%E2%80%931832)"] Thomas Boylston Adams. The State Department tasked Adams with
developing commercial relations with Prussia and Sweden, but President Adams also asked his son to write
 to him frequently about affairs in Europe.[31] In 1799, Adams negotiated a new trade agreement between
the United States and Prussia, though he could never complete an agreement with Sweden.[32] He
frequently wrote to family members in the United States, and in 1801 his letters about the Prussian region
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silesia"] Silesia were published in a book titled Letters on Silesia.[33] During his time in Prussia, Adams
befriended the German diplomat and writer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_von_Gentz"] Friedrich von Gentz, whose work, The Origins and Principles
of the American Revolution, Compared with the Origins and Principles of the French Revolution, Adams
would translate into English in 1800. In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1800_United_States_presidential_election"] 1800 presidential election, Jefferson defeated John Adams, and
both Adams and his son left office in early 1801.[34]
U.S. Senator from Massachusetts
On his return to the United States, Adams re-established a legal practice in Boston, and in April 1802 he
 was elected to the Massachusetts Senate.[35] In November of that year, he ran unsuccessfully for the United
States House of Representatives.[36] In February 1803, the Massachusetts legislature elected Adams to the
 United States Senate. Though somewhat reluctant to affiliate with any political party, Adams joined the
Federalist minority in Congress.[37] Like his Federalist colleagues, he opposed the impeachment of
 Associate Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Chase"] Samuel Chase, an outspoken supporter of the Federalist Party.[38]
Adams had strongly opposed Jefferson's 1800 presidential candidacy, but he gradually became alienated
from the Federalist Party. His disaffection was driven by the party's declining popularity, disagreements
over foreign policy, and Adams's hostility to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Pickering"] Timothy Pickering, a Federalist Party leader whom Adams
viewed as overly favorable to Britain. Unlike other New England Federalists, Adams supported the
Jefferson administration's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase"] Louisiana Purchase and expansionist policies.[39] Adams was the lone Federalist
in Congress to vote for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-importation_Act"] Non-importation Act of 1806 that punished Britain for its attacks on American
shipping during the ongoing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars"] Napoleonic Wars. Adams became increasingly frustrated with the
unwillingness of other Federalists to condemn British actions, including impressment, and he moved closer
to the Jefferson administration. After Adams supported the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embargo_Act_of_1807"] Embargo Act of 1807, the Federalist-controlled
Massachusetts legislature elected Adams's successor several months before the end of his term, and Adams
resigned from the Senate shortly thereafter.[40]
Page 6
While a member of the Senate, Adams served as a professor of logic at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University"] Brown University[41] and as the
 Boylston Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University"] Harvard University. Adams's devotion to classical rhetoric
shaped his response to public issues, and he would remain inspired by those rhetorical ideals long after the
neo-classicalism and deferential politics of the founding generation were eclipsed by the commercial ethos
and mass democracy of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonian_democracy"] Jacksonian Era. Many of Adams's idiosyncratic positions were rooted in his
abiding devotion to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero"] Ciceronian ideal of the citizen-orator "speaking well" to promote the welfare of the
polis.[42] He was also influenced by the classical republican ideal of civic eloquence espoused by British
philosopher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume"] David Hume.[43] Adams adapted these classical republican ideals of public oratory to the
American debate, viewing its multilevel political structure as ripe for "the renaissance of Demosthenic
eloquence". His Lectures on Rhetoric and Oratory (1810) looks at the fate of ancient oratory, the necessity
of liberty for it to flourish, and its importance as a unifying element for a new nation of diverse cultures and
beliefs. Just as civic eloquence failed to gain popularity in Britain, in the United States interest faded in the
second decade of the 19th century, as the "public spheres of heated oratory" disappeared in favor of the
private sphere.[44]
Minister to Russia 
After resigning from the Senate, Adams was ostracized by Massachusetts
Federalist leaders, but he declined Democratic-Republican entreaties to
 seek office.[45] In 1809, he argued before the Supreme Court of the
United States in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher_v._Peck"] Fletcher v. Peck, and the Supreme Court ultimately
agreed with Adams's argument that the Constitution's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_Clause"] Contract Clause
prevented the state of Georgia from invalidating a land sale to out-of-state
companies.[46] Later that year, President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison appointed
Adams as the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Russia"] United States Minister to Russia in 1809. Though
Adams had only recently broken with the Federalist Party, his support of
Jefferson's foreign policy had earned him goodwill with the Madison
Administration.[47] Adams was well-qualified for the role after his
experiences in Europe generally and Russia specifically.[48]
1815 US passport issued by
John Quincy Adams at
London. 
After a difficult passage through the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea"] Baltic Sea, Adams arrived in the
Russian capital of St. Petersburg in October 1809. He quickly established
 a productive working relationship with Russian official Nikolay
Rumyantsev and eventually befriended Tsar [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_I_of_Russia"] Alexander I of Russia.
Adams continued to favor American neutrality between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"] France and
 Britain during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_War"] Napoleonic War.[49] Louisa was initially distraught at the prospect of living in Russia,
but she became a popular figure at the Russian court.[50] From his diplomatic post, Adams observed the
French Emperor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon"] Napoleon's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia"] invasion of Russia, which ended in defeat for the French.[51] In February
1811, President Madison nominated Adams as an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_Justice_of_the_United_States_Supreme_Court"] Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.[52]
The nomination was unanimously confirmed by the Senate, but Adams declined the seat, preferring a
career in politics and diplomacy, so [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Story"] Joseph Story took the seat instead.[53]
Treaty of Ghent and ambassador to Britain
Adams had long feared that the United States would enter a war it could not win against Britain, and by
early 1812, he saw such a war as inevitable due to the constant British attacks on American shipping and
the British practice of impressment. In mid-1812, the United States declared war against Britain, beginning
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812"] War of 1812. Tsar Alexander attempted to mediate the conflict between Britain and the United States,
and President Madison appointed Adams, Secretary of the Treasury [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Gallatin"] Albert Gallatin, and Federalist Senator
 James A. Bayard to a delegation charged with negotiating an end to the war. Gallatin and Bayard arrived in
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1815_US_passport_-_LONDON.jpg"]
Page 7
St. Petersburg in July 1813, but the British declined Tsar
Alexander's offer of mediation. Hoping to start negotiations at
another venue, Adams left Russia in April 1814.[54] Negotiations
finally began in mid-1814 in Ghent, where Adams, Gallatin, and
Bayard were joined by two additional American delegates,
 Jonathan Russell and former [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives"] Speaker of the House [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay"] Henry Clay.[55]
Adams, the nominal head of the delegation, got along well with
Gallatin, Bayard, and Russell, but he occasionally clashed with
Clay.[56]
The British delegation initially treated the United States as a
defeated power, demanding the creation of an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_barrier_state"] Indian barrier state
from American territory near the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes"] Great Lakes. The American
delegation unanimously rejected this offer, and their negotiating
 position was bolstered by the American victory in the Battle of
 Plattsburgh.[57] By November 1814, the government of Lord Adams portrait – [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Stuart"] Gilbert Stuart, 1818
Liverpool decided to seek an end to hostilities with the U.S. on the
basis of status quo ante bellum. Even though a return to the status quo would mean the continuation of the
British practice of impressment, Adams and his fellow commissioners had hoped for similar terms. The
treaty was signed on December 24, 1814. The United States did not gain any concessions from the treaty
but could boast that it had survived a war against the strongest power in the world. Following the signing of
the treaty, Adams traveled to Paris, where he witnessed first-hand the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Days"] Hundred Days of Napoleon's
restoration.[58]
In May 1815, Adams learned that President Madison had appointed
him as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_the_United_Kingdom"] U.S. ambassador to Britain.[59] With the aid of Clay and
Gallatin, Adams negotiated a limited trade agreement with Britain.
Following the conclusion of the trade agreement, much of Adams's
time as ambassador was spent helping stranded American sailors
and prisoners of war.[60] In pursuit of national unity, newly elected
president [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe"] James Monroe decided a Northerner would be optimal for
the position of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State"] Secretary of State, and he chose the respected and
experienced Adams for the role.[61] Having spent several years in
Europe, Adams returned to the United States in August 1817.[60]
Secretary of State (1817–1825)
Adams served as Secretary of State during Monroe's eight-year
presidency, from 1817 to 1825. Many of his successes as secretary,
such as the convention of 1818 with the United Kingdom, the 
Painting of John Quincy Adams by
 Thomas Sully, 1824
Transcontinental Treaty with Spain, and the Monroe Doctrine, were
not preplanned strategies but responses to unexpected events.
Adams wanted to delay American recognition of the newly independent republics of Latin America to
avoid the risk of war with Spain and its European allies. However, Andrew Jackson's military campaign in
Florida and Henry Clay's threats in Congress forced Spain to cut a deal, which Adams negotiated
successfully. Biographer James Lewis says, "He managed to play the cards that he had been dealt – cards
that he very clearly had not wanted – in ways that forced the Spanish cabinet to recognize the weakness of
its own hand".[62] Apart from the Monroe doctrine, his last four years as Secretary of State were less
successful because he was preoccupied with his presidential campaign and refused to make compromises
with other countries that might have weakened his candidacy; the result was a small-scale trade war but a
successful election to the White House.

Taking office in the aftermath of the War of 1812, Adams thought that the country had been fortunate in
avoiding territorial losses, and he prioritized avoiding another war with a European power, particularly
Britain.[63] He also sought to avoid exacerbating sectional tensions, which had been a major issue for the
country during the War of 1812.[64][c] One of the major challenges confronting Adams was how to respond
to the power vacuum in Latin America that arose from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"] Spain's weakness following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsular_War"] Peninsular War.[66]
In addition to his foreign policy role, Adams held several domestic duties, including overseeing the 1820
 Census and writing an extensive report on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weights_and_measures"] weights and measures.[67] The weights and measures report, a
particular passion of Adams', provided an extensive historical perspective on the topic and advocated for
adoption of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system"] metric system.[68]
 Monroe and Adams agreed on most major foreign policy issues: both favored neutrality in Latin American
independence wars, peace with the United Kingdom, rejection of a trade agreement with the French, and
peaceful expansion into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire"] Spanish Empire's North American territories.[69] The president and his
secretary of state developed a strong working relationship, and while Adams often influenced Monroe's
policies, he respected that Monroe made the final decisions on major issues.[70] Monroe met regularly with
his five-person cabinet, which initially consisted of Adams, Secretary of the Treasury [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Crawford"] William H. Crawford,
Secretary of War [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Calhoun"] John C. Calhoun, Secretary of the Navy [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Williams_Crowninshield"] Benjamin Crowninshield, and Attorney General
 William Wirt.[71] Adams developed a strong respect for Calhoun but believed that Crawford was unduly
focused on succeeding Monroe in 1824.[72]
During his time as ambassador to Britain, Adams
had begun negotiations over several contentious
issues that had not been solved by the War of
1812 or the Treaty of Ghent. In 1817, the two
countries agreed to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush%E2%80%93Bagot_Treaty"] Rush–Bagot Treaty, which
limited naval armaments on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes"] Great Lakes.
Negotiations between the two powers continued,
resulting in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_1818"] Treaty of 1818, which defined the
 Canada–United States border west of the Great
Lakes. The boundary was set at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/49th_parallel_north"] 49th parallel
to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains"] Rocky Mountains, while the territory to the
 west of the mountains, known as Oregon
Country, would be jointly occupied. The
 agreement marked a watershed moment in United
Kingdom–United States relations, as the United
States focused on its southern and western
borders and British concerns about American
expansionism subsided.[73] 
In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs_Treaty"] Adams–Onís Treaty, the United States acquired
 Florida and set the western border of the 1803 Louisiana
Purchase.
Adams–Onís Treaty
When Adams took office, Spanish possessions bordered the United States to the south and west. To the
south, Spain retained control of Florida, which the U.S. had long sought to purchase. Spain struggled to
control the Indian tribes active in Florida, and some of those tribes raided United States territory. To the
west, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Spain"] New Spain bordered the territory acquired by the United States in the Louisiana Purchase, but no
clear boundary had been established between United States and Spanish territory.[63] After taking office,
Adams began negotiations with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_de_On%C3%ADs"] Luis de Onís, the Spanish minister to the United States, for the purchase of
Florida and the settlement of a border between the United States and New Spain. The negotiations were
interrupted by an escalation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole_Wars"] Seminole War, and in December 1818, Monroe ordered General
 Andrew Jackson to enter Florida and retaliate against [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole"] Seminoles that had raided Georgia. Exceeding his
orders, Jackson captured the Spanish outposts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Marks,_Florida"] St. Marks and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensacola,_Florida"] Pensacola and executed two Englishmen.
Page 9
While Jackson's actions outraged the rest of the cabinet, Adams defended them as necessary to the
country's self-defense, and he eventually convinced Monroe and most of the cabinet to support Jackson.[74]
Adams informed Spain that its failure to police its own territory had compelled Jackson to act, and he
advised Spain to either secure the region or sell it to the United States.[75] The British, meanwhile, declined
to risk their recent rapprochement with the United States, and did not make a major diplomatic issue out of
Jackson's execution of two British nationals.[76]
Negotiations between Spain and the United States continued, and Spain agreed to cede Florida. The
determination of the western boundary of the United States proved more difficult. American expansionists
favored setting the border at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande"] Rio Grande, but Spain, intent on protecting its colony of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Spain"] Mexico from
American encroachment, insisted on setting the boundary at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabine_River_(Texas%E2%80%93Louisiana)"] Sabine River. At Monroe's direction,
Adams agreed to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabine_River_(Texas%E2%80%93Louisiana)"] Sabine River boundary, but he insisted that Spain cede its claims on Oregon
Country.[77] Adams was deeply interested in establishing American control over the Oregon Country,
partly because he believed that control of that region would spur trade with Asia. The acquisition of
Spanish claims to the Pacific Northwest also allowed the Monroe administration to pair the acquisition of
Florida, which was chiefly sought by Southerners, with territorial gains favored primarily by those in the
North.[78] After extended negotiations, Spain and the United States agreed to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs_Treaty"] Adams–Onís Treaty,
which was ratified in February 1821.[74] Adams was deeply proud of the treaty, though he privately was
concerned by the potential expansion of slavery into the newly acquired territories.[79] In 1824, the Monroe
administration would strengthen US claims to Oregon by ratifying the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-American_Treaty_of_1824"] Russo-American Treaty of 1824,
which established [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_America"] Russian Alaska's southern border at 54°40′ north.[80]
Monroe Doctrine
As the Spanish Empire continued to fracture during Monroe's second term, Adams, Monroe and Clay
became increasingly concerned that the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Alliance"] Holy Alliance" of Prussia, Austria, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"] Russia would seek to
bring Spain's erstwhile colonies under their control, to the point of even contemplating a Holy Alliance of
their own to defend democracy. In his 1821 Fourth of July address, Adams addressed this issue, noting a
shared "chain of sympathy" between the U.S. and Latin America, but arguing for neutrality rather than a
Holy Alliance.[81] In 1822, following the conclusion of the Adams–Onís Treaty, the Monroe administration
recognized the independence of several Latin American countries, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina"] Argentina and Mexico. In
1823, British Foreign Secretary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Canning"] George Canning suggested that the United States and Britain should work
together to preserve the independence of these fledgling republics. The cabinet debated whether to accept
the offer, but Adams opposed it. Instead, Adams urged Monroe to publicly declare the United States'
opposition to any European attempt to colonize or re-take control of territory in the Americas, while also
 committing the United States to neutrality in European affairs. In his December 1823 annual message to
Congress, Monroe laid out the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine"] Monroe Doctrine, which was largely built upon Adams's ideas.[82] In
issuing the Monroe Doctrine, the United States displayed a new level of assertiveness in international
relations, as the doctrine represented the country's first claim to a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere_of_influence"] sphere of influence. It also marked the
country's shift in psychological orientation away from Europe and towards the Americas. Debates over
foreign policy would no longer center on relations with Britain and France, but instead focus on western
expansion and relations with Native Americans.[83] The doctrine became one of the foundational principles
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_U.S._foreign_policy"] U.S. foreign policy.[82]
1824 presidential election
Immediately upon becoming Secretary of State, Adams emerged as one of Monroe's most likely successors,
as the last three presidents had all served in the role before taking office. As the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1824_United_States_presidential_election"] 1824 election approached,
Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun (who later dropped out of the race), and William H. Crawford appeared to be
 Adams's primary competition to succeed Monroe.[84] Crawford favored state sovereignty and a strict
Page 10
 constructionist view of the Constitution, while Clay, Calhoun, and
Adams embraced federally funded [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_improvements"] internal improvements, high
tariffs, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States"] Second Bank of the United States, which was also
known as the national bank.[85] Because the Federalist Party had
all but collapsed after the War of 1812, all the major presidential
candidates were members of the Democratic-Republican Party.[86]
Adams felt that his own election as president would vindicate his
father, while also allowing him to pursue an ambitious domestic
policy. Though he lacked the charisma of his competitors, Adams
was widely respected and benefited from the lack of other
prominent Northern political leaders.[87]
Adams's top choice for the role of vice president was General
Andrew Jackson; Adams noted that "the Vice-Presidency was a  1824 presidential election results
station in which [Jackson] could hang no one, and in which he
would need to quarrel with no one".[88] However, as the 1824 election approached, Jackson jumped into
the race for president, and Calhoun ended up receiving the Vice-presidential support of Adams
supporters.[86] While the other candidates based their candidacies on their long tenure as congressmen,
ambassadors, or members of the cabinet, Jackson's appeal rested on his military service, especially in the
 Battle of New Orleans.[89] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_nominating_caucus"] congressional nominating caucus had decided upon previous Democratic-
Republican presidential nominees, but it had become largely discredited by 1824. Candidates were instead
nominated by state legislatures or nominating conventions, and Adams received the endorsement of the
New England legislatures.[90] The regional strength of each candidate played an important role in the
election; Adams was popular in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England"] New England, Clay and Jackson were strong in the West, and Jackson and
Crawford competed for the South.[91]
In the 1824 presidential election, Jackson
won a plurality in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)"] Electoral College,
taking 99 of the 261 electoral votes, while

Adams won 84, Crawford won 41, and
Clay took 37. Calhoun, meanwhile, won
a majority of the electoral votes for vice
president.[91] Adams nearly swept the
electoral votes of New England and won
 a majority of the electoral votes in New
York, but he won just six electoral votes
from the slave states. Most of Jackson's
support came from slave-holding states,
but he also won [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey"] New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, and some electoral votes
from the Northwest.[92] As no candidate

 election under the terms of the Twelfth Total: 13 (54%)  Total: 7 (29%)  Total: 4 (17%)
Amendment. The House would decide
among the top three electoral vote winners, with each state's delegation having one vote; thus, unlike his
three rivals, Clay was not eligible to be elected by the House.[91]
Adams knew that his own victory in the contingent election would require the support of Clay, who
wielded immense influence in the House of Representatives.[93] Though they were quite different in
temperament and had clashed in the past, Adams and Clay shared similar views on national issues. By
contrast, Clay viewed Jackson as a dangerous demagogue, and he was unwilling to support Crawford due
Page 11
to the latter's health issues.[94] Adams and Clay met before the contingent election, and Clay agreed to
support Adams in the election.[95] Adams also met with Federalists such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Webster"] Daniel Webster, promising that
he would not deny governmental positions to members of their party.[96] On February 9, 1825, Adams won
the contingent election on the first ballot, taking 13 of the 24 state delegations. Adams won the House
delegations of all the states in which he or Clay had won a majority of the electoral votes, as well as the
delegations of Illinois, Louisiana, and Maryland.[95] Adams's victory made him the first child of a president
to serve as president himself.[d] After the election, many of Jackson's supporters claimed that Adams and
Clay had reached a "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupt_Bargain"] Corrupt Bargain" whereby Adams promised Clay the position of Secretary of State in
return for Clay's support.[95]
Presidency (1825–1829)
Inauguration
Adams was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_John_Quincy_Adams"] inaugurated on March 4, 1825, becoming the first son of a former United States president to
 himself become president, a feat only repeated 176 years later by George W. Bush, son of George H. W.
Bush. He took the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office_of_the_president_of_the_United_States#Use_of_Bibles"] oath of office on a book of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_law"] constitutional law, instead of the more traditional Bible.[97]
In his inaugural address, he adopted a post-partisan tone, promising that he would avoid party-building and
politically motivated appointments. He also proposed an elaborate program of "internal improvements":
roads, ports, and canals. Though some were worried about the constitutionality of such federal projects,
Adams argued that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxing_and_Spending_Clause"] General Welfare Clause provided for broad constitutional authority. He promised
that he would ask Congress to authorize many such projects.[98]
Administration
Adams presided over a harmonious and productive cabinet that he
met with on a weekly basis.[99] Like Monroe, Adams sought a
geographically balanced cabinet that would represent the various
party factions, and he asked the members of the Monroe cabinet to
 remain in place for his own administration.[100] Samuel L.
Southard of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey"] New Jersey stayed on as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Navy"] Secretary of the Navy,
 William Wirt kept his post of Attorney General,[101] and John
McLean of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio"] Ohio continued to serve as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postmaster_General"] Postmaster General, an
important position that was not part of the cabinet.[102] Adams's
first choices for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War"] Secretary of War and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury"] Secretary of the Treasury
were Andrew Jackson and William Crawford, but each declined to
serve in the administration. Adams instead selected [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Barbour"] James Barbour
 of Virginia, a prominent supporter of Crawford, to lead the War
Department. Leadership of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury"] Treasury Department went to
 Richard Rush of Pennsylvania, who would become a prominent
advocate of internal improvements and protective tariffs within the
 administration.[103] Adams chose Henry Clay as Secretary of
State, angering those who believed that Clay had offered his
support in the 1824 election for the most prestigious position in the
cabinet.[104] Though Clay would later regret accepting the position
since it reinforced the "Corrupt Bargain" accusation, Clay's
strength in the West and interest in foreign policy made him a
natural choice for the top cabinet position.[105]

Domestic affairs
Ambitious agenda
In his 1825 annual message to Congress,[106] Adams presented a comprehensive and ambitious agenda. He
called for major investments in internal improvements as well as the creation of a national university, a
naval academy, and a national astronomical observatory. Noting the healthy status of the treasury and the
possibility for more revenue via land sales, Adams argued for the completion of several projects that were
in various stages of construction or planning, including a road from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."] Washington, D.C. to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans"] New Orleans.[107]
He also proposed the establishment of a Department of the Interior as a new cabinet-level department that
would preside over these internal improvements.[108] Adams hoped to fund these measures primarily
through Western land sales, rather than increased taxes or public debt.[85] The domestic agenda of Adams
and Clay, which would come to be known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_System_(economic_plan)"] American System, was designed to unite disparate
regional interests in the promotion of a thriving national economy.[109]
Adams's programs faced opposition from various quarters. Many disagreed with his broad interpretation of
the constitution and preferred that power be concentrated in state governments rather than the federal
government. Others disliked interference from any level of government and were opposed to central
planning.[110] Some in the South feared that Adams was secretly an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States"] abolitionist and that he sought to
subordinate the states to the federal government.[111] Most of the president's proposals were defeated in
Congress. Adams's ideas for a national university, a national observatory, and the establishment of a
uniform system of weights and measures never received congressional votes.[112] His proposal for the
creation of a naval academy won the approval of the Senate but was defeated in the House; opponents
objected to the naval academy's cost and worried that the establishment of such an institution would
 "produce degeneracy and corruption of the public morality".[113] Adams's proposal to establish a national
bankruptcy law was also defeated.[112]
Unlike other aspects of his domestic agenda, Adams won congressional approval for several ambitious
infrastructure projects.[114] Between 1824 and 1828, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers"] United States Army Corps of Engineers
conducted surveys for a bevy of potential roads, canals, railroads, and improvements in river navigation.
Adams presided over major repairs and further construction on the National Road, and shortly after he left
office the National Road extended from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland,_Maryland"] Cumberland, Maryland, to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanesville,_Ohio"] Zanesville, Ohio.[115] The Adams
administration also saw the beginning of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesapeake_and_Ohio_Canal"] Chesapeake and Ohio Canal; the construction of the
 Chesapeake & Delaware Canal and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_and_Portland_Canal"] Louisville and Portland Canal around the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falls_of_the_Ohio"] Falls of the Ohio; the
connection of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes"] Great Lakes to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_River"] Ohio River system in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio"] Ohio and Indiana; and the enlargement and
rebuilding of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismal_Swamp_Canal"] Dismal Swamp Canal in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina"] North Carolina.[116] Additionally, the first passenger railroad in
the United States, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad"] Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, was constructed during Adams's presidency. Though
many of these projects were undertaken by private actors, the government often provided money or land to
aid the completion of such projects.[117]
Formation of political parties
In the immediate aftermath of the 1825 contingent election, Jackson was gracious to Adams.[118]
Nevertheless, Adams's appointment of Clay rankled Jackson, who received a flood of letters encouraging
him to run. In 1825, Jackson accepted the presidential nomination of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee"] Tennessee legislature for the 1828
election.[119] Though he had been close to Adams during Monroe's presidency, Vice President Calhoun
was also politically alienated from the president by the appointment of Clay, since that appointment
established Clay as the natural heir to Adams.[120] Adams's ambitious December 1825 annual message to
Congress further galvanized the opposition, with important figures such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Preston_Blair"] Francis Preston Blair of
Page 13
 Kentucky and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hart_Benton_(politician)"] Thomas Hart Benton of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"] Missouri breaking with the Adams
 administration.[121] By the end of the first session of the 19th United
States Congress, an anti-Adams congressional coalition consisting of
Jacksonians (led by Benton and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Lawson_White"] Hugh Lawson White), Crawfordites (led
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren"] Martin Van Buren and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Macon"] Nathaniel Macon), and Calhounites (led by
 Robert Y. Hayne and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_McDuffie"] George McDuffie) had emerged.[122] Aside from
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Everett"] Clay, Adams lacked strong supporters outside of the North, and Edward
Everett, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Taylor_(politician)"] John Taylor, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Webster"] Daniel Webster served as his strongest
advocates in Congress.[123] Supporters of Adams began calling
General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson"] Andrew Jackson, 
themselves [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Republicans"] National Republicans, while supporters of Jackson began
calling themselves Democrats.[124] In the press, they were often described
as "Adams Men" and "Jackson Men".[125]
Adams's opponent in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1824_United_States_presidential_election"] 1824
 and 1828 United States
presidential elections 
In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_elections,_1826"] 1826 elections, Adams's opponents picked up seats throughout the
country, as allies of Adams failed to coordinate among themselves.[126]
 Andrew Stevenson, a Jackson supporter, replaced John Taylor, an Adams
supporter, as Speaker of the House.[127] As Adams himself noted, the
United States had never seen a Congress that was firmly under the control
of political opponents of the president.[128] After the elections, Van Buren and Calhoun agreed to throw
their support behind Jackson in 1828, with Van Buren bringing along many of Crawford's supporters.[129]
Though Jackson did not articulate a detailed political platform in the same way that Adams did, his
coalition united in opposition to Adams's reliance on government planning.[130] Adams, meanwhile, clung
to the hope of a non-partisan nation, and he refused to make full use of the power of patronage to build up
his own party structure.[131]
Tariff of 1828
During the first half of his administration, Adams avoided taking a
strong stand on tariffs, partly because he wanted to avoid alienating
his allies in the South and New England.[132] After Jacksonians
took power in 1827, they devised a tariff bill designed to appeal to
Western states while instituting high rates on imported materials
important to the economy of New England. It is unclear whether
Van Buren, who shepherded the bill through Congress, meant for
the bill to pass, or if he had deliberately designed it to force Adams
 and his allies to oppose it.[133] Regardless, Adams signed the Tariff
of 1828, which became known as the "Tariff of Abominations" by
opponents. Adams was denounced in the South, and he received
little credit for the tariff in the North.[134]
Indian policy  Painting of Quincy Adams by
Charles Osgood, 1828
Adams sought the gradual assimilation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States"] Native Americans via
consensual agreements, a priority shared by few whites in the
1820s. Yet Adams was also deeply committed to the westward expansion of the United States. Settlers on
the frontier, constantly seeking to move westward, cried for a more expansionist policy that disregarded the
concerns of Native Americans. Early in his term, Adams suspended the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Indian_Springs_(1825)"] Treaty of Indian Springs after
learning that the Governor of Georgia, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Troup"] George Troup, had forced the treaty on the Muscogee.[135] Adams
signed a new treaty with the Muscogee in January 1826 that allowed the Muscogee to stay but ceded most
of their land to Georgia. Troup refused to accept its terms and authorized all Georgian citizens to evict the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscogee"]
Page 14
Muscogee.[136] A showdown between Georgia and the federal government was only averted after the
Muscogee agreed to a third treaty.[137] Though many saw Troup as unreasonable in his dealings with the
federal government and the Native Americans, the administration's handling of the incident alienated those
in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_South"] Deep South who favored immediate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_removal"] Indian removal.[138]
Foreign affairs
Trade and claims 
One of the major foreign policy goals of the Adams administration was
the expansion of American trade.[139] His administration reached
 reciprocity treaties with a number of nations, including Denmark, Prussia,
and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Republic_of_Central_America"] Federal Republic of Central America. The administration also
reached commercial agreements with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hawaii"] Kingdom of Hawaii and the
 Kingdom of Tahiti.[140] Agreements with Denmark and Sweden opened
their colonies to American trade, but Adams was especially focused on
opening trade with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_West_Indies"] British West Indies. The United States had reached
a commercial agreement with Britain in 1815, but that agreement
excluded British possessions in the Western Hemisphere. In response to
United States pressure, the British had begun to allow a limited amount of
Quincy Adams appointed American imports to the West Indies in 1823, but United States leaders
 Henry Clay as Secretary of
State 
continued to seek an end to Britain's protective [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Preference"] Imperial Preference
 system.[141] In 1825, Britain banned United States trade with the British
West Indies, dealing a blow to Adams's prestige.[142] The Adams
administration negotiated extensively with the British to lift this ban, but
the two sides could not reach an agreement.[143] Despite the loss of trade with the British West Indies, the
other commercial agreements secured by Adams helped expand the overall volume of United States
exports.[144]
Latin America
Aside from an unsuccessful attempt to purchase [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Texas"] Texas from Mexico, President Adams did not seek to
expand into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America"] Latin America or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"] North America.[145] Adams and Clay instead sought engagement with Latin
America to prevent it from falling under the British Empire's economic influence.[146] As part of this goal,
the administration favored sending a United States delegation to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Panama"] Congress of Panama, an 1826
conference of New World republics organized by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar"] Simón Bolívar.[147] Clay and Adams hoped that the
conference would inaugurate a "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Neighbor_policy"] Good Neighborhood Policy" among the independent states of the
Americas.[148] However, the funding for a delegation and the confirmation of delegation nominees became
entangled in a political battle over Adams's domestic policies, with opponents such as Van Buren impeding
the confirmation of a delegation.[110] While Van Buren saw the Panama Congress as an unwelcome
deviation from the more [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_non-interventionism"] isolationist foreign policy established by President Washington,[148] many
Southerners opposed involvement with any conference attended by delegates from Haiti, a republic that
had been established through a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution"] slave revolt.[149] Though the United States delegation finally won
confirmation from the Senate, it never reached the Congress of Panama due to the Senate's delay.[150]
1828 presidential election
Page 15
The Jacksonians formed an effective party apparatus that adopted
many modern campaign techniques. Rather than focusing on
issues, they emphasized Jackson's popularity and the supposed
corruption of Adams and the federal government. Jackson himself
described the campaign as a "struggle between the virtue of the
people and executive patronage".[151] Adams, meanwhile, refused
to adapt to the new reality of political campaigns, and he avoided
public functions and refused to invest in pro-administration tools
such as newspapers.[152] In early 1827, Jackson was publicly
accused of having encouraged his wife, Rachel, to desert her first
husband.[153] In response, followers of Jackson attacked Adams's
personal life, and the campaign turned increasingly nasty.[154] The
Jacksonian press portrayed Adams as an out-of-touch elitist,[155]
while pro-Adams newspapers attacked Jackson's past involvement 
1828 presidential election results
in various duels and scuffles, portraying him as too emotional and
impetuous for the presidency. Though Adams and Clay had hoped that the campaign would focus on the
American System, it was instead dominated by the personalities of Jackson and Adams.[156]
Vice President Calhoun joined Jackson's ticket, while Adams turned to Secretary of the Treasury Richard
Rush as his running mate.[157] The 1828 election thus marked the first time in United States history that a
presidential ticket composed of two Northerners faced off against a presidential ticket composed of two
Southerners.[158] In the election, Jackson won 178 of the 261 electoral votes and just under 56% of the
popular vote.[159] Jackson won 50.3% of the popular vote in the free states, but 72.6% of the vote in the
slave states.[160] No future presidential candidate would match Jackson's proportion of the popular vote
until [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt"] Theodore Roosevelt's 1904 campaign, while Adams's loss made him the second one-term president,
after his own father.[159] By 1828, only two states did not hold a popular vote for president, and the
number of votes in the 1828 election was triple that in the 1824 election. This increase in votes was due not
only to the recent wave of democratization, but also because of increased interest in elections and the
growing ability of the parties to mobilize voters.[161] Adams did not attend Jackson's inauguration, making
him one of only four presidents who finished their terms but skipped the event.[162]
Later congressional career (1830–1848)
Jackson administration, 1830–1836
Adams considered permanently retiring from public life after his 1828 defeat, and he was deeply hurt by
the suicide of his son, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Adams"] George Washington Adams, in 1829.[163] He was appalled by many of the Jackson
administration's actions, including its embrace of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoils_system"] spoils system[164] and the prosecution of his close
friend, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury"] Treasury Auditor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Watkins"] Tobias Watkins, for embezzlement.[165] Though they had once maintained a
cordial relationship, Adams and Jackson each came to loathe the other in the decades after the 1828
election.[166] Adams grew bored with his retirement and still felt that his career was unfinished, so he ran
for and won a seat in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"] United States House of Representatives in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections,_1830"] 1830 elections.[167] His election
went against the generally held opinion, shared by his own wife and youngest son, that former presidents
should not run for public office.[168] Nonetheless, he would win election to nine terms, serving from 1831
 until his death in 1848.[1] Adams and Andrew Johnson are the only former presidents to serve in
Congress.[169] After winning election, Adams became affiliated with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Masonic_Party"] Anti-Masonic Party, partly
because the National Republican Party's leadership in Massachusetts included many of the former
Page 16
Federalists that Adams had clashed with earlier in his career. The
Anti-Masonic Party originated as a  movement against
Freemasonry, but it developed into the country's first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_party_(United_States)"] third party
and embraced a general program of anti-elitism.[170]
Adams expected a light workload when he returned to Washington
at 64 years old, but Speaker [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Stevenson"] Andrew Stevenson selected Adams
chair of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Energy_and_Commerce"] Committee on Commerce and Manufactures.[171]
Though he identified as a member of the Anti-Masonic Party,
Congress was broadly polarized into allies of Jackson and
opponents of Jackson, and Adams generally aligned with the latter
camp.[172] Stevenson, an ally of Jackson, expected that the
committee chairmanship would keep Adams busy defending the
tariff even while the Jacksonian majority on the committee would
prevent Adams from accruing any real power.[173] As chair of the
committee charged with writing tariff laws, Adams became an
important player in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullification_crisis"] Nullification crisis, which stemmed largely
 from Southern objections to the high rates imposed by the Tariff of
 1828. South Carolina leaders argued that states could nullify federal 
Daguerreotype of Quincy Adams by
Philip Haas, 1843
laws, and they announced that they would bar the federal
government from enforcing the tariff in their state.[174] Adams helped pass the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_1832"] Tariff of 1832, which
lowered rates, but not enough to mollify the South Carolina nullifiers. The crisis ended when Clay and
Calhoun agreed to another tariff bill, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_1833"] Tariff of 1833, that furthered lower tariff rates. Adams was
appalled by the Nullification Crisis's outcome, as he felt that the Southern states had unfairly benefited from
challenging federal law.[175] After the crisis, Adams was convinced that Southerners exercised undue
influence over the federal government through their control of Jackson's Democratic Party.[176]
In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1833_Massachusetts_gubernatorial_election"] 1833 Massachusetts gubernatorial election, the Anti-Masonic Party nominated Adams in a four-way
race between Adams, the National Republican candidate, the Democratic candidate, and a candidate of the
 Working Men's Party. The National Republican candidate, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Davis_(Massachusetts_governor)"] John Davis, won 40% of the vote, while Adams
finished in second place with 29%. Because no candidate won a majority of the vote, the state legislature
decided the election. Rather than seek election by the legislature, Adams withdrew his name from
contention, and the legislature selected Davis.[177] Adams was nearly elected to the Senate in 1835 by a
coalition of Anti-Masons and National Republicans, but his support for Jackson in a minor foreign policy
matter annoyed National Republican leaders enough that they dropped their support for his candidacy.[178]
After 1835, Adams never again sought higher office, focusing instead on his service in the House of
Representatives.[179]
Van Buren, Harrison and Tyler administrations, 1837–1843
In the mid-1830s, the Anti-Masonic Party, the National Republicans, and other groups opposed to Jackson
coalesced into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)"] Whig Party.[180] In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1836_United_States_presidential_election"] 1836 presidential election Democrats put forward Martin Van
Buren, while the Whigs fielded multiple presidential candidates. Because he disdained all the major party
contenders for president, Adams did not take part in the campaign; Van Buren won the election.[181]
Nonetheless, Adams became aligned with the Whig Party in Congress.[182] Adams generally opposed the
initiatives of President Van Buren, long a political adversary, though they maintained a cordial public
relationship.[183]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Texas"] Republic of Texas won its independence from Mexico in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Revolution"] Texas Revolution of 1835–1836. Texas
had largely been settled by Americans from the Southern United States, and many of those settlers owned
slaves despite an 1829 Mexican law that abolished slavery. Many in the United States and Texas thus
Page 17
favored the admission of Texas into the union as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_states_and_free_states"] slave state.
Adams considered the issue of Texas to be "a question of far
deeper root and more overshadowing branches than any or all
others that agitate the country", and he emerged as one of the
leading congressional opponents of annexation. When he served as
secretary of state, Adams had sought to acquire Texas, but he
argued that, because Mexico had abolished slavery, the acquisition
of Texas would transform the region from a free territory into a
slave state. He also feared that the annexation of Texas would
encourage Southern expansionists to pursue other potential slave
states, including Cuba. Adams's firm stance may have played a role
in discouraging Van Buren from pushing for the annexation of
Texas during his presidency.[184]
Whig nominee [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison"] William Henry Harrison defeated Van Buren in the
 1840 presidential election, and the Whigs gained control of both Portrait of Quincy Adams by William
houses of Congress for the first time. Despite his low regard for Hudson, 1844
Harrison as a person, Adams was enthusiastic about the new Whig
administration and the end of the long-standing Democratic
dominance of the federal government.[185] However, Harrison died in April 1841 and was succeeded by
Vice President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyler"] John Tyler, a Southerner who, unlike Adams, Henry Clay, and many other prominent
Whigs, did not embrace the American System. Adams saw Tyler as an agent of "the slave-driving,
Virginia, Jeffersonian school, principled against all improvement". After Tyler vetoed a bill to restore the
national bank, Whig congressmen expelled Tyler from the party. Adams was appointed chairman of a
special committee that explored impeaching Tyler, and Adams presented a scathing report of Tyler that
argued that his actions warranted impeachment. The impeachment process did not move forward, though,
because the Whigs did not believe that the Senate would vote to remove Tyler from office.[186]
Opposition to the Mexican-American War,
1844–1848
Tyler made the annexation of Texas the main foreign policy priority
of the later stages of his administration.[187] He attempted to win
ratification of an annexation treaty in 1844, but, to Adams's surprise
and relief, the Senate rejected the treaty.[188] The annexation of
Texas became the central issue of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1844_United_States_presidential_election"] 1844 presidential election,
 and Southerners blocked the nomination of Van Buren at the 1844
Democratic National Convention due to the latter's opposition to
annexation; the party instead nominated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_K._Polk"] James K. Polk, an acolyte
of Andrew Jackson.[189] Though he once again did not take part in
the campaigning, Adams was deeply disappointed that Polk
defeated his old ally, Henry Clay, in the 1844 election. He
attributed the outcome of the election partly to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Party_(United_States,_1840)"] Liberty Party, a
small, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States"] abolitionist third party that may have siphoned votes from 
John Quincy Adams, c. 1840s,
Unknown author
Clay in the crucial state of New York.[190] After the election, Tyler,
whose term would end in March 1845, once again submitted an annexation treaty to Congress.[e] Adams
strongly attacked the treaty, arguing that the annexation of Texas would involve the United States in "a war
for slavery".  Despite Adams's opposition, both houses of Congress approved the treaty, with most
Democrats voting for annexation and most Whigs voting against it. Texas thus joined the United States as a
slave state in 1845.[192]
Page 18
Adams had served with James K. Polk in the House of Representatives, and Adams loathed the new
president, seeing him as another expansionist, pro-slavery Southern Democrat.[193] Adams favored the
annexation of the entirety of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Country"] Oregon Country, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_boundary_dispute"] disputed region occupied by both the United States and
Britain, and was disappointed when President Polk signed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Treaty"] Oregon Treaty, which divided the land
between the two claimants at the 49th parallel.[194] Polk's expansionist aims centered instead on the
Mexican province of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alta_California"] Alta California, and he attempted to buy the province from Mexico. The Mexican
government refused to sell California or recognize the independence and subsequent American annexation
of Texas. Polk deployed a military detachment led by General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary_Taylor"] Zachary Taylor to back up his assertion that
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande"] Rio Grande constituted the Southern border of both Texas and the United States. After Taylor's forces
clashed with Mexican soldiers north of the Rio Grande, Polk asked for a declaration of war in early 1846,
asserting that Mexico had invaded American territory. Though some Whigs questioned whether Mexico
had started an aggressive war, both houses of Congress declared war, with the House voting 174-to-14 to
approve the declaration. One of the 14 dissenting votes was Adams, who believed that Polk was seeking to
wage an offensive to expand slavery.[195] After the start of the war, he supported the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmot_Proviso"] Wilmot Proviso, an
unsuccessful legislative proposal that would have banned slavery in any territory ceded by Mexico.[196]
After 1846, ill health increasingly affected Adams, but he continued to oppose the Mexican–American War
until his death in 1848.[197]
Anti-slavery movement
In the 1830s, slavery emerged as an increasingly polarizing issue in the
United States.[198] A longtime opponent of slavery, Adams used his new
role in Congress to fight it, and he became the most prominent national
leader opposing slavery.[199] After one of his reelection victories, he said
that he must "bring about a day prophesied when slavery and war shall be
banished from the face of the Earth". He wrote in his private journal in
1820:[200]
 BEP engraved portrait of
Adams as president 
The discussion of this [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Compromise"] Missouri question has betrayed the
secret of their souls. In the abstract they admit that slavery is
an evil, they disclaim it, and cast it all upon the shoulder of
Great Britain. But when probed to the quick upon it, they
show at the bottom of their souls pride and vainglory in their
condition of masterdom. They look down upon the simplicity
of a Yankee's manners, because he has no habits of
overbearing like theirs and cannot treat negroes like dogs. It
is among the evils of slavery that it taints the very sources of
moral principle. It establishes false estimates of virtue and
vice: for what can be more false and heartless than this
doctrine which makes the first and holiest rights of humanity
to depend upon the color of the skin?
In 1836, partially in response to Adams's consistent presentation of citizen petitions requesting the abolition
of slavery in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia"] District of Columbia, the House of Representatives imposed a "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gag_rule_(United_States)"] gag rule" that immediately
 tabled any petitions about slavery. Democrats and Southern Whigs favored the rule, but Northern Whigs,
like Adams, opposed it.[201] In late 1836, Adams began a campaign to ridicule slave owners and the gag
rule. He frequently attempted to present anti-slavery petitions, often in ways that provoked strong reactions
from Southern representatives.[202] Though the gag rule remained in place,[203] the discussion ignited by
Page 19
his actions and the attempts of others to quiet him raised questions of the right to petition, the right to
legislative debate, and the morality of slavery. Adams fought actively against the gag rule for another seven
years, eventually moving the resolution that led to its repeal in 1844.[204]
In 1841, at the request of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Tappan"] Lewis Tappan and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Gray_Loring"] Ellis Gray Loring,
Adams joined the case of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._The_Amistad"] United States v. The Amistad. Adams
went before the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States"] Supreme Court on behalf of African slaves who
had revolted and seized the Spanish ship Amistad. Adams appeared
on February 24, 1841, and spoke for four hours. His argument
succeeded: the Court ruled that the Africans were free and they
returned to their homes.[205]
Smithsonian Institution
Adams also became a leading force for the promotion of science. In
1829, British scientist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Smithson"] James Smithson died, and he left his fortune
for the "increase and diffusion of knowledge". In Smithson's will,
he stated that should his nephew, Henry James Hungerford, die
without heirs, the Smithson estate would go to the government of
the United States to create an "Establishment for the increase and
diffusion of Knowledge among men".  After the nephew died

Portrait Gallery by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Caleb_Bingham"] George Bingham

without heirs in 1835, President Andrew Jackson informed
 Congress of the bequest, which amounted to about US$500,000 (US$75 million in 2008 dollars after
inflation). Adams realized that this might allow the United States to realize his dream of building a national
institution of science and learning. Adams thus became Congress's primary supporter of the future
 Smithsonian Institution.[206]
The money was invested in shaky state bonds, which quickly defaulted. After heated debate in Congress,
Adams successfully argued to restore the lost funds with interest.[207] Though Congress wanted to use the
money for other purposes, Adams successfully persuaded Congress to preserve the money for an institution
of science and learning. Congress also debated whether the federal government had the authority to accept
the gift, though with Adams leading the initiative, Congress accepted the legacy bequeathed to the nation
and pledged the faith of the United States to the charitable trust on July 1, 1836.[208] Partly due to Adams's
efforts, Congress voted to establish the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution"] Smithsonian Institution in 1846. A nonpolitical board of regents was
established to lead the institution, which included a museum, art gallery, library, and laboratory.[209]
Death 
In mid-November 1846, the 78-year-old former president suffered a
stroke that left him partially paralyzed. After a few months of rest, he
made a full recovery and resumed his duties in Congress. When Adams
entered the House chamber on February 13, 1847, everyone "stood up
and applauded".[210]
On February 21, 1848, the House of Representatives was discussing the
Adams's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenotaph"] cenotaph at the  matter of honoring [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army"] United States Army officers who served in the
Congressional Cemetery Mexican–American War. Adams had been a vehement critic of the war,
and as Congressmen rose up to say, "Aye!" in favor of the measure, he
instead yelled, "No!"[211] He rose to answer a question put forth by
Speaker of the House [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Charles_Winthrop"] Robert Charles Winthrop.[212] Immediately thereafter, Adams collapsed, having
Page 20
suffered a massive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemorrhage"] cerebral hemorrhage.[213] Two days later, on February 23, he died at 7:20 p.m. with his
wife at his side in the Speaker's Room inside the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol"] Capitol Building in Washington, D.C.; his only living
child, Charles Francis, did not arrive in time to see his father alive. His last words were "This is the last of
Earth. I am content".[212] Among those present for his death was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln"] Abraham Lincoln, then a freshman
representative from Illinois.[214]
His original interment was temporary, in the public vault at the
 Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Later, he was
interred in the family burial ground in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy,_Massachusetts"] Quincy, Massachusetts,
across from the (Unitarian) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_First_Parish_Church"] United First Parish Church, called
 Hancock Cemetery. After Louisa's death in 1852, his son had his
parents re-interred in the expanded family crypt in the United First
Parish Church across the street, next to John and Abigail. Both
tombs are viewable by the public. Adams's original tomb at
Hancock Cemetery is still there and marked simply "J.Q.
Adams".[215]

Church
Adams and Louisa had three sons and a daughter. Their daughter,
Louisa, was born in 1811 but died in 1812.[216] They named their first son [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Adams"] George Washington Adams
(1801–1829) after the first president. This decision upset Adams's mother, and, by her account, his father as
well.[217] Both George and their second son, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_II"] John (1803–1834), led troubled lives and died in early
adulthood.[218][219] George, who had long suffered from alcoholism, died in 1829 after going overboard
on a steamboat; it is not clear whether he fell or purposely jumped from the boat.[220] John, who ran an
unprofitable flour and grist mill owned by his father, died of an unknown illness in 1834.[221] Adams's
youngest son, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Francis_Adams_Sr."] Charles Francis Adams Sr., was an important leader of the "Conscience Whigs", a Northern,
anti-slavery faction of the Whig Party.[197] Charles served as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Soil_Party"] Free Soil Party's vice presidential
 candidate in the 1848 presidential election and later became a prominent member of the Republican
Party.[222]
Personality
Adams's personality and political beliefs were much like his father's.[223]
He always preferred solitary reading to social engagements, and he was
repeatedly persuaded to stay in public service by others. Historian Paul
Nagel states that, like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln"] Abraham Lincoln after him, Adams often suffered
from depression, for which he sought treatment in early years. Adams
thought his depression was due to the high expectations demanded of him
by his father and mother. Throughout his life, he felt inadequate and
socially awkward because of his depression, and was constantly bothered
by his physical appearance.[223] He was closer to his father, with whom
he spent much of his early life with abroad, than he was to his mother. In  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Dollar"] Presidential Dollar of John
his youth, while the American Revolution raged on, Adams heard from Quincy Adams
his mother about his father's work and the substantial risks he took to
support it. As a result, he developed a deep respect for his father.[223] In
contrast, Adams had a rocky relationship with his mother, due to her high expectations of him, and her fear
that her children would follow in the footsteps of her brother, who died of alcoholism.[223] His biographer,
Nagel, concludes that his mother's disapproval of Louisa Johnson motivated him to marry Johnson in 1797,
despite Adams's reservations that Johnson, like his mother, had a forceful personality.[223]
Page 21
Though Adams wore a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wig"] powdered wig in his youth,[224] he abandoned this fashion and became the first
president to adopt a short haircut instead of long hair tied in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(hairstyle)"] queue and to regularly wear long [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trousers"] trousers
instead of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culottes"] knee breeches.[225][226] It has been suggested that John Quincy Adams had the highest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient"] I.Q. of
any U.S. president.[227][228] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Simonton"] Dean Simonton, a professor of psychology at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Davis"] UC Davis, estimated his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient"] I.Q.
score at 165.[229] He reportedly spoke eight foreign languages (Latin, Greek, French, German, Spanish,
Italian, Dutch, and Russian).[230]
Legacy
Historical reputation
Adams is widely regarded as one of the most effective diplomats
 and secretaries of state in American history,[231][232] but scholars
generally rank him as an average president.[233][234] Adams is
remembered as a man eminently qualified for the presidency, yet
hopelessly weakened in his presidential leadership potential
because of the 1824 election. Most importantly, Adams is
remembered as a poor politician in an era when politics had begun
to matter more. He spoke of trying to serve as a man above the
"baneful weed of party strife" at the precise moment in history
when the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Party_System"] Second Party System was emerging with nearly
 revolutionary force.[169] Biographer and historian William J.
Cooper Jr. comments that Adams "does not loom large in the
American imagination",  but that he has received more public
attention since the late 20th century due to his anti-slavery stances.
Cooper writes that Adams was the first "major public figure" to
publicly question whether the United States could remain united so
long as the institution of slavery persisted.[231] Historian Daniel 
 Official portrait of Adams by George

Walker Howe writes that Adams's "intellectual ability and courage
were above reproach, and his wisdom in perceiving the national
interest has stood the test of time".[235] Historians have often included Adams among the leading
conservatives of his day.[236][237][238][239] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Kirk"] Russell Kirk sees Adams as a flawed conservative and
imprudent in opposing slavery.[237] He has also been praised as a strong prose stylist, with James Parker
describing him as one of the "three authentically muddy-eyed and pained-by-subjectivity writers" that the
White House has harbored, along with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln"] Abraham Lincoln and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama"] Barack Obama.[240]
Memorials
 John Quincy Adams Birthplace is now part of Adams National
Historical Park and open to the public. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_House_(Harvard_University)"] Adams House, one of
twelve undergraduate residential Houses at Harvard University, is
named for John Adams, John Quincy Adams, and other members
of the Adams family associated with Harvard.[241] John Quincy
Adams tower, located in the Southwest residential area of the
 University of Massachusetts Amherst, is named for the
 president.[242] In 1870, Charles Francis built the first presidential
library in the United States, to honor his father. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_National_Historical_Park#Stone_Library"] Stone Library 
Peacefield - John Quincy Adam's
Home
Page 22
includes over 14,000 books written in twelve languages. The library is located at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacefield"] Peacefield (the "Old
House") at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_National_Historical_Park"] Adams National Historical Park in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy,_Massachusetts"] Quincy, Massachusetts.
An [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_Memorial"] Adams Memorial has been proposed in Washington, D.C., honoring Adams and his wife, son, father,
mother, and other members of their family.
Adams's middle name of Quincy has been used by several locations in the United States, including the
town of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy,_Illinois"] Quincy, Illinois. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_County,_Illinois"] Adams County, Illinois and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_County,_Indiana"] Adams County, Indiana are also named after Adams.
 Adams County, Iowa, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_County,_Wisconsin"] Adams County, Wisconsin, were each named for either John Adams or John
Quincy Adams.
Some sources contend that in 1843 Adams sat for the earliest
confirmed photograph of a United States president, although others
maintain that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison"] William Henry Harrison had posed even earlier for his
portrait, in 1841.[243] The original [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype"] daguerreotype is in the
 collection of the National Portrait Gallery of the Smithsonian
Institution.[244]
Film and television
Adams occasionally is featured in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media"] mass media. In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS"] PBS
miniseries [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adams_Chronicles"] The Adams Chronicles (1976),  he was portrayed by
 David Birney, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Daniels"] William Daniels, Marcel Trenchard, Steven Grover
and Mark Winkworth. He was also portrayed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Hopkins"] Anthony Hopkins

Notes
a. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy,_Massachusetts"] The Quincy family name was pronounced /ˈkwɪnzi/, as in the name of Quincy,
Massachusetts (then called Braintree), where Adams was born. All of the other Quincy place
names are locally [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈkwɪnsi/. Though not accurate, this pronunciation is also commonly used
for Adams's middle name.[2]
b. When Adams took office as president in 1825, Louisa became the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady"] First Lady born
outside of the United States. In 2017, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump"] Melania Trump became the second First Lady born
outside of the United States.[27]
c. Adams had been especially concerned by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartford_Convention"] Hartford Convention, which had been called
by anti-war Federalists to discuss their grievances against the Madison administration.[65]
Page 23
d. In 2001, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush"] George W. Bush would become the second child of a president to serve as
president.
e. Tyler had initially sent the treaty to the Senate; the Constitution provides that a two-thirds
vote of the Senate is required to ratify any treaty. After the 1844 election, Tyler asked
Congress to approve the treaty via [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_resolution"] joint resolution, which would require a simple majority
vote in both houses of Congress.[191]
