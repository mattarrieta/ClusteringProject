Andrew Jackson
Andrew Jackson (March 15, 1767 – June 8, 1845)
was an American lawyer, general, and statesman who
served as the 7th [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"] president of the United States from
1829 to 1837. Before being elected to the presidency,
 Jackson gained fame as a general in the United States
 Army and served in both houses of the U.S.
Congress. An expansionist president, Jackson sought
to advance the rights of the "common man"[1] against
a "corrupt aristocracy"[2] and to preserve the Union. 
Andrew Jackson
Born in the colonial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxhaws"] Carolinas in the decade before
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War"] American Revolutionary War, Jackson became a
 frontier lawyer and married Rachel Donelson
 Robards. He served briefly in the United States House
of Representatives and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Senate"] United States Senate,
representing Tennessee. After resigning, he served as
a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_justices_of_the_Tennessee_Supreme_Court"] justice on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Supreme_Court"] Tennessee Supreme Court from 1798
until 1804. Jackson purchased a property later known
as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hermitage_(Nashville,_Tennessee)"] The Hermitage, and became a  wealthy,
slaveowning planter. In 1801, he was appointed
colonel of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_State_Guard"] Tennessee militia and was elected its
commander the following year. He led troops during
 the Creek War of 1813–1814, winning the Battle of
 Horseshoe Bend. The subsequent Treaty of Fort
Jackson required the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscogee"] Creek surrender of vast lands in
present-day [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama"] Alabama and Georgia. In the concurrent
 war against the British, Jackson's victory in 1815 at
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_New_Orleans"] Battle of New Orleans made him a national hero.
 Jackson then led U.S. forces in the First Seminole
War, which led to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs_Treaty"] annexation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"] Florida from
Spain. Jackson briefly served as Florida's  first
territorial governor before returning to the Senate. He
ran for president in 1824, winning a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_(voting)"] plurality of the
popular and electoral vote. As no candidate won an
electoral majority, the House of Representatives
elected [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams"] John Quincy Adams in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingent_election"] contingent election.
In reaction to the alleged "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupt_bargain"] corrupt bargain" between
Adams and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay"] Henry Clay and the ambitious agenda of
President Adams, Jackson's supporters founded the
 Democratic Party.
Jackson ran again in 1828, defeating Adams in a
landslide. Jackson faced the threat of secession by
 South Carolina over what opponents called the "Tariff
of Abominations". The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullification_Crisis"] crisis was defused when the

tariff was amended, and Jackson [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Bill"] threatened the use of
military force if South Carolina attempted to secede.
In Congress, Henry Clay led the effort to reauthorize
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States"] Second Bank of the United States. Jackson,
regarding the Bank as a corrupt institution that
benefited the wealthy at the expense of ordinary
Americans, vetoed the renewal of its charter. After a
lengthy struggle, Jackson and his allies thoroughly
dismantled the Bank. In 1835, Jackson became the
only president to completely pay off the national debt,
fulfilling a longtime goal. While Jackson pursued
numerous reforms designed to eliminate waste and
corruption, his presidency marked the beginning of
the ascendancy of the party "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoils_system"] spoils system" in
 American politics. In 1830, Jackson signed the Indian
Removal Act, which [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_removal"] forcibly removed most members
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Civilized_Tribes"] major tribes of the Southeast to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Territory"] Indian Territory;
 these removals were subsequently known as the Trail
of Tears. The relocation process dispossessed these
nations of their land and resulted in widespread death
and disease. Jackson opposed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States"] abolitionist
movement, which grew stronger in his second term.
In foreign affairs, Jackson's administration concluded
 a "most favored nation" treaty with the United
Kingdom, settled claims of damages against France
from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars"] Napoleonic Wars, and recognized the
 Republic of Texas. In January 1835, he survived the
first assassination attempt on a sitting president.
In his retirement, Jackson remained active in
Democratic Party politics, supporting the presidencies
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren"] Martin Van Buren and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_K._Polk"] James K. Polk. Though
fearful of its effects on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States"] slavery debate, Jackson
advocated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Texas"] annexation of Texas, which was
accomplished shortly before his death. Jackson has
been widely revered in the United States as an
advocate for democracy and the common man. Many
of his actions proved divisive, garnering both fervent
support and strong opposition from many in the
country. His reputation has suffered since the 1970s,
largely due to his anti-abolitionist views and policy of
the forcible removal of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States"] Native Americans from their
ancestral homelands. However, surveys of historians
and scholars have [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States"] ranked Jackson favorably among
U.S. presidents.

Early life and education
Andrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waxhaws"] Waxhaws region of the Carolinas. His parents were
 Scots-Irish colonists Andrew Jackson and his wife Elizabeth Hutchinson, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterians"] Presbyterians who had emigrated
from Ulster, Ireland, two years earlier.[3][4] Jackson's father was born in Carrickfergus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Antrim"] County Antrim,
 around 1738.[5] Jackson's parental ancestors crossed into Northern Ireland from Scotland after the Battle of
the Boyne in 1690.[6]
When they migrated to North America in 1765, Jackson's parents brought two children with them from
Ireland, Hugh (born 1763) and Robert (born 1764).[7] The family probably landed in Philadelphia. Most
likely they traveled overland through the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains"] Appalachian Mountains to the Scots-Irish community in the
Waxhaws, straddling the border between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina"] North and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina"] South Carolina.[8] Jackson's father died in February
1767 at the age of 29, in a logging accident while clearing land, three weeks before his son Andrew was
born.[7] Jackson, his mother, and his brothers lived with Jackson's aunt and uncle in the Waxhaws region.[9]
Jackson's exact birthplace is unclear because of a lack of knowledge of his mother's actions immediately
following her husband's funeral.[10] The area was so remote that the border between North and South
Carolina had not been officially surveyed.[11] In 1824, Jackson wrote a letter saying he had been born on
the plantation of his uncle James Crawford in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster_County,_South_Carolina"] Lancaster County, South Carolina.[10] Jackson may have
claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_1824"] Tariff of 1824,
which he opposed. In the mid-1850s, second-hand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a
different uncle's home in North Carolina.[11][12] As a young boy, Jackson was easily offended and was
considered something of a bully. He was, however, also said to have taken a group of younger and weaker
boys under his wing and been kind to them.[13]
Revolutionary War service
 During the Revolutionary War, Jackson's eldest brother, Hugh, died from heat exhaustion after the Battle of
Stono Ferry on June 20, 1779.[14] Anti-British sentiment intensified following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Waxhaws"] Waxhaws Massacre on
May 29, 1780. Jackson's mother encouraged him and his elder brother Robert to attend the local militia
 drills.[15] Soon, they began to help the militia as couriers.[16] They served under Colonel William
Richardson Davie at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hanging_Rock"] Battle of Hanging Rock on August 6.[15] Andrew and Robert were captured by
the British in April 1781[16][17] while staying at the home of the Crawford family. When Andrew refused
to clean the boots of a British officer, the officer slashed at the youth with a sword, leaving him with scars
Page 5
on his left hand and head, as well as an intense hatred for the
British. Robert also refused to do as commanded and was struck
with the sword.[18] The two brothers were held as prisoners,
contracted smallpox, and nearly starved to death in captivity.[19]
Later that year, their mother Elizabeth secured the brothers' release.
She then began to walk both boys back to their home in the
Waxhaws, a distance of some 40 miles (64 km). Both were in very
poor health. Robert, who was far worse, rode on the only horse
they had, while Andrew walked behind them. In the final two
hours of the journey, a torrential downpour began which worsened
the effects of the smallpox. Within two days of arriving back home,
Robert was dead and Andrew in mortal danger.[20][21] After

nursing Andrew back to health, Elizabeth volunteered to nurse
American [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war"] prisoners of war on board two British ships in the
 Charleston harbor, where there had been an outbreak of cholera. In November, she died from the disease
and was buried in an unmarked grave. Andrew became an orphan at age 14. He blamed the British
personally for the loss of his brothers and mother.[22]
Early career
Legal career and marriage
After the Revolutionary War, Jackson received a sporadic education in a local Waxhaw school.[23] On bad
terms with much of his extended family, he boarded with several different people.[24] In 1781, he worked
for a time as a saddle-maker, and eventually taught school. He apparently prospered in neither
profession.[25] In 1784, he left the Waxhaws region for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury,_North_Carolina"] Salisbury, North Carolina, where he [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_law"] studied law
 under attorney Spruce Macay.[26] With the help of various lawyers, he was able to learn enough to qualify
for the bar. In September 1787, Jackson was admitted to the North Carolina bar.[24] Shortly thereafter, his
friend [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McNairy"] John McNairy helped him get appointed to a vacant prosecutor position in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_District,_North_Carolina"] Western District of
North Carolina, which would later become the state of Tennessee. During his travel west, Jackson bought
his first slave, a woman who was older than him. In 1788, having been offended by fellow lawyer
 Waightstill Avery, Jackson fought his first duel. The duel ended with both men firing into the air, having
made a secret agreement to do so before the engagement.[27][28]
Jackson moved to the small frontier town of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee"] Nashville in 1788, where he lived as a boarder with Rachel
Stockly Donelson, the widow of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Donelson"] John Donelson. Here Jackson became acquainted with their daughter,
 Rachel Donelson Robards. The younger Rachel was in an unhappy marriage with Captain Lewis Robards;
he was subject to fits of jealous rage.[29] The two were separated in 1790. According to Jackson, he
married Rachel after hearing that Robards had obtained a divorce. Her divorce had not been made final,
making Rachel's marriage to Jackson [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigamy"] bigamous and therefore invalid. After the divorce was officially
completed, Rachel and Jackson remarried in 1794.[30] To complicate matters further, evidence shows that
Rachel had been living with Jackson and referred to herself as Mrs. Jackson before the petition for divorce
was ever made.[31] It was not uncommon on the frontier for relationships to be formed and dissolved
unofficially, as long as they were recognized by the community.[32]
Land speculation and early public career
Page 6
In 1794, Jackson formed a partnership with fellow lawyer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Overton_(judge)"] John Overton, dealing in claims for land
reserved by treaty for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee"] Cherokee and Chickasaw.[33] Like many of their contemporaries, they dealt in
such claims although the land was in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_territory"] Indian territory. Most of the transactions involved grants made under a
 'land grab' act of 1783 that briefly opened Indian lands west of the Appalachians within North Carolina to
 claim by that state's residents. He was one of the three original investors who founded Memphis,
Tennessee, in 1819.[34]
After moving to Nashville, Jackson became a protege of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blount"] William Blount, a friend of the Donelsons and one
of the most powerful men in the territory. Jackson became attorney general in 1791, and he won election as
a delegate to the Tennessee [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_meeting)"] constitutional convention in 1796.[27] When Tennessee achieved statehood that
year, he was elected its only [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"] U.S. Representative. He was a member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party"] Democratic-Republican Party,
the dominant party in Tennessee.[35] As a representative, Jackson staunchly advocated for the rights of
Tennesseans against Native American tribal interests. He strongly opposed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Treaty"] Jay Treaty and criticized
 George Washington for allegedly removing Democratic-Republicans from public office. Jackson joined
several other Democratic-Republican congressmen in voting against a resolution of thanks for Washington,
a vote that would later haunt him when he sought the presidency.[36] In 1797, the state legislature elected
him as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate"] U.S. senator. Jackson seldom participated in debate and found the job dissatisfying. He pronounced
himself "disgusted with the administration" of President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams"] John Adams and resigned the following year
without explanation.[37] Upon returning home, with strong support from western Tennessee, he was elected
to serve as a judge of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Supreme_Court"] Tennessee Supreme Court[38] at an annual salary of $600.[39] Jackson's service as
a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and good decision-
making.[40] Jackson resigned the judgeship in 1804. His official reason for resigning was ill health. He had
been suffering financially from poor land ventures, and so it is also possible that he wanted to return full-
time to his business interests.[41]
After arriving in Tennessee, Jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the Tennessee militia.[42] In
1802, while serving on the Tennessee Supreme Court, he declared his candidacy for major general, or
commander, of the Tennessee militia, a position voted on by the officers. At that time, most free men were
members of the militia. The organizations, intended to be called up in case of armed conflicts, resembled
large social clubs. Jackson saw it as a way to advance his stature.[43] With strong support from western
Tennessee, he tied with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sevier"] John Sevier with seventeen votes. Sevier was a popular Revolutionary War veteran
and former governor, the recognized leader of politics in eastern Tennessee. On February 5, Governor
 Archibald Roane broke the tie in Jackson's favor.[44] Jackson had also presented Roane with evidence of
land fraud against Sevier. Subsequently, in 1803, when Sevier announced his intention to regain the
governorship, Roane released the evidence. Jackson then published a newspaper article accusing Sevier of
fraud and bribery. Sevier insulted Jackson in public, and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter.
Despite the charges leveled against Sevier, he defeated Roane and continued to serve as governor until
1809.[45]
Planting career and controversy
In addition to his legal and political career, Jackson prospered as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planter_(American_South)"] planter and merchant. He built a home
and the first general store in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallatin,_Tennessee"] Gallatin, Tennessee, in 1803. The next year, he acquired [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hermitage_(Nashville,_Tennessee)"] The Hermitage, a
640-acre (259 ha) plantation in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_County,_Tennessee"] Davidson County, near Nashville. He later added 360 acres (146 ha) to the
plantation, which eventually totaled 1,050 acres (425 ha).  The primary crop was cotton. Like most
successful American planters at the time, Jackson's plantation depended on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States"] slave labor. The cotton
cultivated at the Hermitage was planted and picked by slaves. The Hermitage was quite profitable; Jackson
began with nine slaves, owned as many as 44 by 1820, and later up to 150, placing him among the planter
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coahoma_County,_Mississippi"] elite. Jackson also co-owned with his son Andrew Jackson Jr. the Halcyon plantation in Coahoma County,
Mississippi, which housed 51 slaves at the time of his death.[47] Throughout his lifetime, Jackson owned
over 300 slaves.[48]
Page 7
Men, women, and child slaves were owned by Jackson on three
sections of the Hermitage plantation. Slaves lived in extended
family units of between five and ten persons and were quartered in
400 square feet (37 m2) cabins made either of brick or logs. The
size and quality of the Hermitage slave quarters exceeded the
standards of the time. To help slaves acquire food, Jackson supplied
them with guns, knives, and fishing equipment. At times he paid
his slaves with money and coins to trade in local markets. Jackson
permitted slaves to be whipped if he believed his slaves' offenses
were severe enough.[48] At various times he posted advertisements
for fugitive slaves who had escaped from his plantation. In an 1804
advertisement, Jackson offered "ten dollars extra, for every hundred
lashes any person will give him, to the amount of three
hundred".[49] Jackson expressed concern for the slaves' treatment,
attempted to keep slave families together, and urged his overseers to
treat them with humanity. He believed in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paternalism"] paternalistic idea of
slavery, which claimed that slave ownership was morally
acceptable as long as owners served as paternal figures for slaves,
offering food, shelter, and other necessities.[50][51]
The controversy surrounding his marriage to Rachel remained a
sore point for Jackson, who deeply resented attacks on his wife's
honor. By May 1806, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickinson_(historical_figure)"] Charles Dickinson, who, like Jackson, raced 
Notice of reward offered by Jackson
for return of an enslaved man[46]
horses, had published an attack on Jackson in the local newspaper,
and it resulted in a written challenge from Jackson to a duel. Since Dickinson was considered an expert
shot, Jackson determined it would be best to let Dickinson turn and fire first, hoping that his aim might be
spoiled in his quickness; Jackson would wait and take careful aim at Dickinson. Dickinson did fire first,
hitting Jackson in the chest. The bullet that struck Jackson was so close to his heart that it could not be
removed. Under the rules of dueling, Dickinson had to remain still as Jackson took aim and shot and killed
him. Jackson's behavior in the duel outraged many in Tennessee, who called it a brutal, cold-blooded
killing and saddled Jackson with a reputation as a violent, vengeful man. He became a social outcast.[52]
After the Sevier affair and the duel, Jackson was looking for a way to salvage his reputation. He chose to
align himself with former vice president [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr"] Aaron Burr. Burr's political career ended after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr%E2%80%93Hamilton_duel"] killing of
 Alexander Hamilton in a duel in 1804; in 1805 he set out on a tour of what was then the western United
States.[53] Burr was extremely well received by the people of Tennessee, and stayed for five days at the
Hermitage.[54] Burr's true intentions are not known with certainty. He seems to have been [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr_conspiracy"] planning a
military operation to conquer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Florida"] Spanish Florida and drive the Spanish from Texas.[55] To many westerners
like Jackson, the promise seemed enticing.[56] Western American settlers had long held bitter feelings
towards Spain due to territorial disputes and their persistent failure to stop Indians living in Spanish territory
from raiding American settlements.[57] On October 4, 1806, Jackson addressed the Tennessee militia,
declaring that the men should be "at a moment's warning ready to march."[58] On the same day, he wrote to
 James Winchester, proclaiming that the United States "can conquer not only the Floridas [at that time there
was an East Florida and a West Florida.], but all Spanish North America." He continued:
I have a hope (Should there be a call) that at least, two thousand Volunteers can be lead into
the field at a short notice—That number commanded by firm officers and men of enterprise—I
think could look into Santafee and Maxico—give freedom and commerce to those provinces
and establish peace, and a permanent barier against the inroads and attacks of forreign powers
on our interior—which will be the case so long as Spain holds that large country on our
borders.[59]
Page 8
Jackson agreed to provide boats and other provisions for the expedition.[60] However, on November 10, he
learned from a military captain that Burr's plans apparently included seizure of New Orleans, then part of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Territory"] Louisiana Territory of the United States, and incorporating it, along with lands won from the Spanish,
into a new empire. He was further outraged when he learned from the same man of the involvement of
Brigadier General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wilkinson"] James Wilkinson, whom he deeply disliked, in the plan.[61] Jackson acted cautiously at
first, but wrote letters to public officials, including President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"] Thomas Jefferson, vaguely warning them
about the scheme. In December, Jefferson, a political opponent of Burr, issued a proclamation declaring that
a treasonous plot was underway in the West and calling for the arrest of the perpetrators. Jackson, safe from
arrest because of his extensive paper trail, organized the militia. Burr was soon captured, and the men were
sent home.[62] Jackson traveled to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia"] Richmond, Virginia, to testify on Burr's behalf in trial. The defense team
decided against placing him on the witness stand, fearing his remarks were too provocative. Burr was
acquitted of treason, despite Jefferson's efforts to have him convicted. Jackson endorsed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe"] James Monroe for
president in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1808_United_States_presidential_election"] 1808 against [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison. The latter was part of the Jeffersonian wing of the Democratic-
Republican Party.[63] Jackson lived relatively quietly at the Hermitage in the years after the Burr trial,
eventually accumulating 640 acres of land.[64]
Military career
War of 1812
Creek campaign and treaty
Leading up to 1812, the United States found itself increasingly
drawn into international conflict. Formal hostilities with Spain or
France never materialized, but tensions with Britain increased for a
number of reasons. Among these was the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny"] desire of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_hawk"] many
Americans for more land, particularly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_under_British_rule"] British Canada and Florida,
the latter still controlled by Spain, Britain's European ally.[65] On
 June 18, 1812, Congress officially declared war on the United
 Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, beginning the War of
1812.[66] Jackson responded enthusiastically, sending a letter to
Washington offering 2,500 volunteers.[67] However, the men were
not called up for many months. Biographer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_V._Remini"] Robert V. Remini
claims that Jackson saw the apparent slight as payback by the
Madison administration for his support of Burr and Monroe.
Meanwhile, the United States military repeatedly suffered
devastating defeats on the battlefield.[68]
On January 10, 1813, Jackson led an army of 2,071 volunteers[69]

General Wilkinson, who commanded Federal forces in New
Orleans. Lacking adequate provisions, Wilkinson ordered Jackson
to halt in Natchez, then part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Territory"] Mississippi Territory, and await further orders. Jackson reluctantly
obeyed.[73] The newly appointed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War"] Secretary of War, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Armstrong_Jr."] John Armstrong Jr., sent a letter to Jackson dated
February 6 ordering him to dismiss his forces and to turn over his supplies to Wilkinson.[74] In reply to
Armstrong on March 15, Jackson defended the character and readiness of his men, and promised to turn
over his supplies. He also promised, instead of dismissing the troops without provisions in Natchez, to

Jackson and his officers turned over their horses to the sick.[76] He paid for provisions for the men out of
his own pocket.[77] The soldiers began referring to their commander as "Hickory," after a hickory nut,
because of his toughness, and Jackson became known as "Old Hickory".[78] After about a month long
march, the army finally arrived in Nashville. His actions earned him respect and praise from the people of
Tennessee.[79] Jackson faced financial ruin, until his former aide-de-camp [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hart_Benton_(politician)"] Thomas Benton persuaded
Armstrong to order the army to pay the expenses Jackson had incurred.[80] On June 14, Jackson served as
a second in a duel on behalf of his junior officer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Carroll_(Tennessee_politician)"] William Carroll against Jesse Benton, the brother of
Thomas. On September 3, Jackson and his top cavalry officer, Brigadier General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coffee"] John Coffee, were
involved in a street brawl with the Benton brothers. Jackson was severely wounded by Jesse with a
gunshot to the shoulder.[81][82] 
On August 30, 1813, a group of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscogee"] Muscogee (or Creek) called the
 Red Sticks, so named because they painted their war clubs red,
perpetrated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Mims_massacre"] Fort Mims massacre in which hundreds of white
American settlers and non-Red Stick Creeks were slaughtered. The
Red Sticks, led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Weatherford"] William Weatherford (also called Red Eagle)
 and Peter McQueen, had broken away from the rest of the Creek
Confederacy, which wanted peace with the United States. They
were allied with Tecumseh, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawnee"] Shawnee chief who had launched
 Tecumseh's War against the United States, and who was fighting
alongside the British. The resulting conflict became known as the
 Creek War.[71][83]
Jackson, with 2,500 American soldiers, was ordered to crush the

 still in a sling from fighting the Bentons. Jackson established Fort
Strother as a supply base. On November 3, Coffee defeated a band
of Red Sticks at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tallushatchee"] Battle of Tallushatchee.[84] Coming to the
relief of friendly Creeks besieged by Red Sticks, Jackson won
another decisive victory at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Talladega"] Battle of Talladega.[85] In the winter, Jackson, encamped at Fort Strother,
faced a severe shortage of troops due to the expiration of enlistments and chronic desertions. He sent
Coffee with the cavalry (which abandoned him) back to Tennessee to secure more enlistments. Jackson
decided to combine his force with that of the Georgia militia, and marched to meet the Georgia troops.
From January 22–24, 1814, while on their way, the Tennessee militia and allied Muscogee were attacked
by the Red Sticks at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Emuckfaw_and_Enotachopo_Creek"] Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek. Jackson's troops repelled the
attackers, but outnumbered, were forced to withdraw to Fort Strother.[86] Jackson, now with over 2,000
troops, marched most of his army south to confront the Red Sticks at a fortress they had constructed at a
bend in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallapoosa_River"] Tallapoosa River. Jackson, together with Lower Creek and Cherokee allies and enjoying an
advantage of more than 2 to 1, engaged them on March 27 at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Horseshoe_Bend_(1814)"] Battle of Horseshoe Bend. An initial
artillery barrage did little damage to the well-constructed fort. A subsequent Infantry charge, in addition to
an assault by Coffee's cavalry and diversions caused by the allied Creeks, overwhelmed the Red Sticks.[87]
The campaign ended three weeks later with Red Eagle's surrender, although some Red Sticks such as
McQueen fled to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Florida"] East Florida.[88] On June 8, Jackson accepted a commission as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadier_general_(United_States)"] brigadier general in the
 United States Army, and 10 days later became a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)"] major general, in command of the Seventh Military
Division.[89] Subsequently, Jackson, with Madison's approval, imposed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Fort_Jackson"] Treaty of Fort Jackson. The
treaty required the Muscogee, including those who had not joined the Red Sticks, to surrender 23 million
acres (8,093,713 ha) of land to the United States.[88] Most of the Creeks bitterly acquiesced.[90] Though in
ill-health from dysentery, Jackson then turned his attention to defeating Spanish and British forces. Jackson
accused the Spanish of arming the Red Sticks and of violating the terms of their neutrality by allowing
Page 10
British soldiers into the Floridas.[91] The first charge was true,[92]
while the second ignored the fact that it was Jackson's threats to
invade Florida which had caused them to seek British
protection.[93] In the November 7 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Pensacola_(1814)"] Battle of Pensacola, Jackson
defeated the relatively small British and Spanish forces in a short
skirmish. Shortly thereafter, the Spanish surrendered and the
remaining British withdrew. Weeks later, Jackson learned that the
British were planning an attack on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans"] New Orleans, which sat on the
mouth of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River"] Mississippi River and held immense strategic and
commercial value. Jackson abandoned Pensacola to the Spanish,
placed a force in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama"] Mobile, Alabama, to guard against a possible
invasion there, and rushed the rest of his forces west to defend New
Orleans.[94]
The Creeks coined their own name for Jackson, Jacksa Chula
Harjo or "Jackson, old and fierce."[95]
Battle of New Orleans 
 General Andrew Jackson by John
Wesley Jarvis, c. 1819
After arriving in New Orleans on December 1, 1814,[96] Jackson
instituted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law"] martial law in the city, as he worried about the loyalty of
the city's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Creole_people"] Creole and Spanish inhabitants. At the same time, he
formed an alliance with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Lafitte"] Jean Lafitte's smugglers, and formed
military units consisting of African-Americans and Muscogees,[97]
in addition to recruiting volunteers in the city. Jackson received
some criticism for paying white and non-white volunteers the same
salary.[98] These forces, along with U.S. Army regulars and
volunteers from surrounding states, joined with Jackson's force in
defending New Orleans. The approaching British force, led by
 Admiral Alexander Cochrane and later General Edward
Pakenham, consisted of over 10,000 soldiers, many of whom had
served in the Napoleonic Wars.[97] Jackson had only about 5,000
men, most of whom were inexperienced and poorly trained.[99]

The British arrived on the east bank of the Mississippi River on the
morning of December 23. That evening, Jackson attacked the British and temporarily drove them
back.[100] On January 8, 1815, the British launched a major frontal assault against Jackson's defenses. An
initial artillery barrage by the British did little damage to the well-constructed American defenses. Once the
morning fog had cleared, the British launched a frontal assault, and their troops made easy targets for the
Americans protected by their parapets. Despite managing to temporarily drive back the American right
flank, the overall attack ended in disaster.[101] For the battle on January 8, Jackson admitted to only 71 total
casualties. Of these, 13 men were killed, 39 wounded, and 19 missing or captured. The British admitted
2,037 casualties. Of these, 291 men were killed (including Pakenham), 1,262 wounded, and 484 missing or
captured.[102] After the battle, the British retreated from the area, and open hostilities ended shortly
thereafter when word spread that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Ghent"] Treaty of Ghent had been signed in Europe that December. Coming in
the waning days of the war, Jackson's victory made him a national hero, as the country celebrated the end
of what many called the "Second American Revolution" against the British.[103] By a Congressional
 resolution on February 27, 1815, Jackson was given the Thanks of Congress and awarded a Congressional
Gold Medal.[38]
Page 11
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville"] Alexis de Tocqueville ("underwhelmed" by Jackson according to a
2001 commentator) later wrote in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_in_America"] Democracy in America that
Jackson "was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained
there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained,
twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans."[104] Some
have claimed that, because the war was already ended by the
preliminary signing of the Treaty of Ghent, Jackson's victory at
New Orleans was without importance aside from making him a
celebrated figure. However, the Spanish, who had sold the
Louisiana Territory to France, disputed France's right to sell it to the
United States through the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase"] Louisiana Purchase in 1803.[105] In April
1815, Spain, assuming that the British had won at New Orleans,
asked for the return of the Louisiana Territory. Spanish
representatives claimed to have been assured that they would
receive the land back.[106] Furthermore, Article IX of the Treaty of
Ghent stipulated that the United States must return land taken from
the Creeks to their original owners, essentially undoing the Treaty
of Fort Jackson. Thanks to Jackson's victory at New Orleans, the
American government felt that it could safely ignore that provision
and it kept the lands that Jackson had acquired.[105]
Enforced martial law in New Orleans 
Jackson at the Battle of New
Orleans, painted by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sully"] Thomas Sully in
1845 from an earlier portrait he had
completed from life in 1824
Jackson, still not knowing for certain of the treaty's signing, refused
to lift martial law in the city. Citizens, local politicians, and some of
Jackson's troops expressed growing displeasure. When some of the
Creoles under Jackson's service, registering as French citizens with
the French consul Louis de Toussard, asked to be discharged based
on their foreign nationality, Jackson ordered all Frenchmen,
including Toussard, to depart to no less than 120 miles from the
limits of New Orleans.[107] State senator Louis Louaillier wrote an
anonymous piece in the New Orleans newspaper challenging
Jackson's refusal to release the militia after the British ceded the
field of battle. Jackson attempted to find the author and, after
Louiallier admitted to having written the piece, he imprisoned
 him.[108] In March, after U.S. District Court Judge Dominic A.
Hall signed a writ of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus"] habeas corpus on behalf of Louaillier,
Jackson ordered [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_of_Dominic_Hall_and_Louis_Louaillier"] Hall's arrest.[109] A military court ordered

Louiallier's release, but Jackson kept him in prison. He released
Hall four miles from the city, which marked the limits of his jurisdiction.[110] Jackson also ordered the
execution of six members of the militia who had attempted to leave. Their deaths were not well publicized
until the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin_Handbills"] Coffin Handbills were circulated during his 1828 presidential campaign.[111] On March 13, news
officially reached the city that the peace treaty had been signed and ratified. Jackson immediately lifted
martial law, released Louaillier from prison, and allowed the return of those he had exiled. Hall
subsequently brought Jackson to trial on charges of contempt of court, and fined him $1,000.[112]
First Seminole War
Page 12
Following the war, Jackson remained in command of troops on the
southern border of the U.S. He conducted business from the
Hermitage.[113] He signed treaties with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee"] Cherokee and
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickasaw"] Chickasaw which gained for the United States large parts of
Tennessee and Kentucky.[114] The treaty with the Chickasaw,
finally agreed to later in the year, is commonly known as the
 Jackson Purchase.[34]
Jackson would soon find himself embroiled in another conflict in
the Floridas. Several Native American tribes, collectively known as
the Seminole, straddled the border between the U.S. and Florida.
The Seminole, in alliance with escaped slaves, frequently raided
Georgia settlements before retreating back into Florida. These
skirmishes continually escalated into the conflict now known as the
 First Seminole War.[115] In 1816, Jackson led a detachment into
Florida and at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Negro_Fort"] Battle of Negro Fort destroyed the fort, killing
most of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Gadsden"] fugitive slaves defending it and a smaller number of
allied Choctaw.[116] Jackson was then ordered by President
Monroe in December 1817 to lead a campaign in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"] Georgia against
the Seminole and Creek. Jackson was again charged with 
Teracotta bust of General Jackson
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rush_(sculptor)"] William Rush, 1819
preventing Florida from becoming a refuge for runaway slaves,
after Spain promised freedom to fugitive slaves. Critics later alleged
that Jackson exceeded orders in his Florida actions. His orders from President Monroe were to "terminate
the conflict."[117] Jackson believed the best way to do this was to seize Florida from Spain once and for all.
Before departing, Jackson wrote to Monroe, "Let it be signified to me through any channel ... that the
possession of the Floridas would be desirable to the United States, and in sixty days it will be
accomplished."[118]
Jackson invaded Florida on March 15, 1818, capturing Pensacola. He crushed Seminole and Spanish
resistance in the region and captured two British agents, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbuthnot_and_Ambrister_incident"] Robert Ambrister and Alexander Arbuthnot, who
had been working with the Seminole. After a brief trial, Jackson executed both of them, causing a
diplomatic incident with the British. Jackson's actions polarized Monroe's cabinet, some of whom argued
that Jackson had gone against Monroe's orders and violated the Constitution, since the United States had
not [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war_by_the_United_States"] declared war upon Spain. He was defended by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State"] Secretary of State [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams"] John Quincy Adams. Adams thought
that Jackson's conquest of Florida would force Spain to finally sell the province, and Spain did indeed sell
Florida to the United States in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs_Treaty"] Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819. A congressional investigation exonerated
Jackson, but he was deeply angered by the criticism he received, particularly from Speaker of the House
 Henry Clay. After the ratification of the Adams–Onís Treaty in 1821, Jackson resigned from the army and
briefly served as the territorial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Florida"] Governor of Florida before returning to Tennessee.[119]
Presidential aspirations
Election of 1824
In the spring of 1822, Jackson suffered a physical breakdown. His body had two bullets lodged in it, and
he had grown exhausted from years of hard military campaigning. He regularly coughed up blood, and his
entire body shook. Jackson feared that he was on the brink of death. After several months of rest, he
recovered.[120] During his convalescence, Jackson's thoughts increasingly turned to national affairs. He
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States"] obsessed over rampant corruption in the Monroe administration and grew to detest the Second Bank of the
United States, blaming it for causing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1819"] Panic of 1819 by contracting credit.[121]
Page 13
Jackson turned down an offer to run for governor of his home state,
but accepted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Overton_(judge)"] John Overton's plan to have the legislature nominate
him for president.[122] On July 22, 1822, he was officially
nominated by the Tennessee legislature.[123] Jackson had come to
dislike Secretary of the Treasury [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Crawford"] William H. Crawford, who had
been the most vocal critic of Jackson in Monroe's cabinet, and he
hoped to prevent Tennessee's electoral votes from going to
Crawford. Yet Jackson's  nomination garnered a welcoming
response even outside of Tennessee, as many Americans
appreciated his attacks on banks. The Panic of 1819 had devastated
the fortunes of many, and banks and politicians seen as supportive
of banks were unpopular. With his growing political viability,
Jackson emerged as one of the five major presidential candidates,
 along with Crawford, Adams, Clay, and Secretary of War John C.
Calhoun. During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_Good_Feelings"] Era of Good Feelings, the Federalist Party had
 Jackson in 1824, painted by Thomas faded away, and all five presidential contenders were members of
Sully  the Democratic-Republican Party. Jackson's campaign promoted
him as a defender of the common people, as well as the one
candidate who could rise above sectional divisions. On the major
issues of the day, most prominently the tariff, Jackson expressed centrist beliefs, and opponents accused
him of obfuscating his positions. At the forefront of Jackson's campaign was combatting corruption.
Jackson vowed to restore honesty in government and to scale back its excesses.[124] As a war hero,
Jackson was popular with ordinary people, and he benefited from the expansion of suffrage among white
males that followed the conclusion of the War of 1812.[125]
In 1823, Jackson reluctantly allowed his name to be placed in contention for one of Tennessee's U.S.
Senate seats. The move was independently orchestrated by his advisors [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Berkeley_Lewis"] William Berkeley Lewis and U.S.
senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Eaton_(politician)"] John Eaton in order to defeat incumbent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams_(Tennessee_politician)"] John Williams, who openly opposed his presidential
candidacy. The legislature narrowly elected him.[126][127] His return, after 24 years, 11 months, 3 days out
of office, marks the second longest gap in service to the chamber in history.[128] Although Jackson was
 reluctant to serve once more in the Senate, he was appointed chairman of the Committee on Military
Affairs.[129] Eaton wrote to Rachel that Jackson as a senator was "in harmony and good understanding
with every body," including Thomas Hart Benton, now a senator from Missouri, with whom Jackson had
fought in 1813.[130] Meanwhile, Jackson himself did little active campaigning for the presidency, as was
customary. Eaton updated an already-written biography of him in preparation for the campaign and, along
with others, wrote letters to newspapers praising Jackson's record and past conduct.[131]
 Democratic-Republican presidential nominees had historically been chosen by informal Congressional
nominating caucuses, but this method had become unpopular. In 1824, most of the Democratic-
Republicans in Congress boycotted the caucus. Those who attended backed Crawford for president and
 Albert Gallatin for vice president. A Pennsylvania convention nominated Jackson for president a month
later, stating that the irregular caucus ignored the "voice of the people" in the "vain hope that the American
people might be thus deceived into a belief that he [Crawford] was the regular democratic candidate."[132]
Gallatin criticized Jackson as "an honest man and the idol of the worshipers of military glory, but from
incapacity, military habits, and habitual disregard of laws and constitutional provisions, altogether unfit for
the office."[133] After Jackson won the Pennsylvania nomination, Calhoun dropped out of the presidential
race and successfully sought the vice presidency instead.[134]
In the presidential election, Jackson won a plurality of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)"] electoral vote, taking states in the South, West,
and Mid-Atlantic. He was the only candidate to win states outside of his regional base, as Adams
dominated New England, Clay took three western states, and Crawford won Virginia and Georgia. Jackson
won a plurality of the popular vote, taking 42 percent, although not all states held a popular vote for the
Page 14
presidency. He won 99 electoral votes, more than any other candidate, but still short of 131, which he
needed for a true majority. With no candidate having won a majority of the electoral votes, the House of
Representatives held a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingent_election"] contingent election under the terms of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] Twelfth Amendment. The amendment
specifies that only the top three electoral vote-winners are eligible to be elected by the House, so Clay was
eliminated from contention. Jackson believed that he was likely to win this contingent election, as Crawford
and Adams lacked Jackson's national appeal, and Crawford had had a debilitating stroke that made many
doubt his physical fitness for the presidency. Clay, who as Speaker of the House presided over the election,
saw Jackson as a dangerous demagogue who might topple the republic in favor of his own leadership. He
threw his support behind Adams, who shared Clay's support for federally funded [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_improvement"] internal improvements
such as roads and canals. With Clay's backing, Adams won the contingent election on the first ballot.
Furious supporters of Jackson accused Clay and Adams of having reached a "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupt_bargain"] corrupt bargain" after Adams
appointed Clay as his Secretary of State.[135] "So you see," Jackson growled, "the Judas of the West has
closed the contract and receive the thirty pieces of silver. [H]is end will be the same."[136] After the
Congressional session concluded, Jackson resigned his Senate seat and returned to Tennessee.[137]
Election of 1828 and death of Rachel Jackson
Almost immediately, opposition arose to the Adams
presidency.[138] Jackson opposed Adams's plan to involve the
U.S. in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama"] Panama's quest for independence, writing, "The
moment we engage in confederations, or alliances with any
nation, we may from that time date the down fall of our
republic." Adams damaged his standing in his first annual
message to Congress, when he argued that Congress must not
give the world the impression "that we are palsied by the will
of our constituents."[139]
Jackson was nominated for president by the Tennessee
legislature in October 1825, more than three years before the
1828 election. It was the earliest such nomination in
presidential history, and it attested to the fact that Jackson's  1828 election results
supporters began the 1828 campaign almost as soon as the
1824 campaign ended. Adams's presidency foundered, as his
ambitious agenda faced defeat in a new era of mass politics. Critics led by Jackson attacked Adams's
policies as a dangerous expansion of Federal power. New York Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren"] Martin Van Buren, who had been a
prominent supporter of Crawford in 1824, emerged as one of the strongest opponents of Adams's policies,
and he settled on Jackson as his preferred candidate in 1828. Van Buren was joined by Vice President
Calhoun, who opposed much of Adams's agenda on states' rights grounds. Van Buren and other Jackson
allies established numerous pro-Jackson newspapers and clubs around the country, while Jackson avoided
campaigning but made himself available to visitors at his Hermitage plantation. In the election, Jackson
won a commanding 56 percent of the popular vote and 68 percent of the electoral vote. The election
marked the definitive end of the one-party Era of Good Feelings, as Jackson's supporters coalesced into the
 Democratic Party and Adams's followers became known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Republican_Party"] National Republicans.[140] In the large
Scots-Irish community that was especially numerous in the rural South and Southwest, Jackson was a
favorite.[141]
The campaign was heavily personal. As was the custom at the time, neither candidate personally
campaigned, but their political followers organized campaign events. Both candidates were rhetorically
attacked in the press. Jackson was labelled a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_trader"] slave trader who bought and sold slaves and moved them
about in defiance of higher standards of slaveholder behavior.[142] A series of pamphlets known as the
 Coffin Handbills were published to attack Jackson, one of which revealed his order to execute soldiers at
Page 15
New Orleans.[111][143] Another accused him of engaging in cannibalism by eating the bodies of American
Indians killed in battle,[144] while still another labeled his mother a "common prostitute" and stated that
Jackson's father was a "mulatto man."[145]
Rachel Jackson was also a frequent target of attacks, and was widely accused of bigamy, a reference to the
controversial situation of her marriage with Jackson.[146] Jackson's campaigners fired back by claiming that
 while serving as Minister to Russia, Adams had procured a young girl to serve as a prostitute for Emperor
Alexander I. They also stated that Adams had a billiard table in the White House and that he had charged
the government for it.[147]
Rachel had been under extreme stress during the election, and often struggled while Jackson was away.
She began experiencing significant physical stress during the election season. Jackson described her
symptoms as "excruciating pain in the left shoulder, arm, and breast." After struggling for three days,
Rachel finally died of a heart attack on December 22, 1828, three weeks after her husband's victory in the
election (which began on October 31 and ended on December 2) and 10 weeks before Jackson took office
as president. A distraught Jackson had to be pulled from her so the undertaker could prepare the body.[148]
He felt that the abuse from Adams's supporters had hastened her death and never forgave him. Rachel was
buried at the Hermitage on Christmas Eve. "May God Almighty forgive her murderers, as I know she
forgave them," Jackson swore at her funeral. "I never can."[149]
Presidency (1829–1837)
Philosophy
Jackson's name has been associated with Jacksonian democracy or
the shift and expansion of democracy with the passing of some
political power from established elites to ordinary voters based in
political parties. "The Age of Jackson" shaped the national agenda
and American politics.[150] Jackson's philosophy as president was
similar to that of Jefferson, advocating [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States"] republican values held by
the Revolutionary generation. Jackson took a moral tone, with the
belief that agrarian sympathies, and strong states rights with a
limited federal government, would produce less corruption.[151] He
feared that monied and business interests would corrupt republican
values. When South Carolina opposed the tariff law, he took a
strong line in favor of nationalism and against secession.[152]
Jackson believed in the ability of the people to "arrive at right
conclusions."[153] They had the right not only to elect but to
"instruct their agents & representatives."[154] Office holders should

 either obey the popular will or resign.[151] He rejected the view of a powerful and independent Supreme
Court with binding decisions, arguing that "the Congress, the Executive, and the Court must each or itself
be guided by its own opinions of the Constitution."[155] Jackson thought that Supreme Court justices
should be made to stand for election, and believed in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_constructionism"] strict constructionism as the best way to ensure
democratic rule.[156] He called for term limits on presidents and the abolition of the Electoral College.[157]
According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_V._Remini"] Robert V. Remini, Jackson "was far ahead of his times–and maybe even further than this
country can ever achieve."[158]
Inauguration
Page 16
Jackson departed from the Hermitage on January 19 and arrived in Washington on February 11. He then set
about choosing his cabinet members.[159] Jackson chose Van Buren as expected for Secretary of State,
 Eaton of Tennessee as Secretary of War, Samuel D. Ingham of Pennsylvania as Secretary of Treasury, John
Branch of North Carolina as Secretary of Navy, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Berrien"] John M. Berrien of Georgia as Attorney General, and
 William T. Barry of Kentucky as Postmaster General. Jackson's first choice of cabinet proved to be
unsuccessful, full of bitter partisanship and gossip.[160] Jackson blamed Adams in part for what was said
about Rachel during the campaign, and refused to meet him after arriving in Washington. Therefore,
Adams chose not to attend the inauguration.[161]
On March 4, 1829, Andrew Jackson became the first United States president-elect to take the oath of office
on the East Portico of the U.S. Capitol.[162] In his inaugural speech, Jackson promised to respect the
sovereign powers of states and the constitutional limits of the presidency. He also promised to pursue
"reform" by removing power from "unfaithful or incompetent hands." At the conclusion of the ceremony,
Jackson invited the public to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"] White House, where his supporters held a raucous party. Thousands of
spectators overwhelmed the White House staff, and minor damage was caused to fixtures and furnishings.
Jackson's populism earned him the nickname "King Mob."[163]
Reforms, rotation of offices, and spoils system
In an effort to purge the government of corruption, Jackson launched presidential investigations into all
executive Cabinet offices and departments. He believed appointees should be hired on merit and withdrew
many candidates he believed were lax in their handling of monies.[164] He believed that the federal
government had been corrupted and that he had received a mandate from the American people to purge
such corruption. Jackson's investigations uncovered enormous fraud in the federal government, and
 numerous officials were removed from office and indicted on corruption, including personal friend of John
Quincy Adams and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury"] Treasury Fourth Auditor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Watkins"] Tobias Watkins.[165][166] In the first year of Jackson's
presidency, his investigations uncovered $280,000 stolen from the Treasury, and the Department of the
Navy was saved $1 million.[166] He asked Congress to reform embezzlement laws, reduce fraudulent
applications for federal pensions, pass revenue laws to prevent evasion of custom duties, and pass laws to
improve government accounting. Jackson's Postmaster General Barry resigned after a Congressional
investigation into the postal service revealed mismanagement of mail services, collusion and favoritism in
awarding lucrative contracts, as well as failure to audit accounts and supervise contract performances.
Jackson replaced Barry with Treasury Auditor and prominent Kitchen Cabinet member [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Kendall"] Amos Kendall,
who went on to implement reforms in the Post Office Department.[167]
Jackson repeatedly called for the abolition of the Electoral College by constitutional amendment in his
annual messages to Congress as president.[168][169] In his third annual message to Congress, he expressed
the view "I have heretofore recommended amendments of the Federal Constitution giving the election of
President and Vice-President to the people and limiting the service of the former to a single term. So
important do I consider these changes in our fundamental law that I can not, in accordance with my sense
of duty, omit to press them upon the consideration of a new Congress."[157]
Although he was unable to implement these goals, Jackson's time in office did see a variety of other
reforms. He supported an act in July 1836 that enabled widows of Revolutionary War soldiers who met
certain criteria to receive their husbands' pensions.[170] In 1836, Jackson established the ten-hour day in
national shipyards.[171]
Jackson enforced the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenure_of_Office_Act_(1820)"] Tenure of Office Act, signed by President Monroe in 1820, that limited appointed
office tenure and authorized the president to remove and appoint political party associates. Jackson believed
that a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_limits_in_the_United_States"] rotation in office was a democratic reform preventing hereditary officeholding and made civil service
responsible to the popular will.[172] Jackson declared that rotation of appointments in political office was "a
Page 17
 BEP engraved portrait of Jackson as
president 
leading principle in the republican creed."[168] Jackson noted, "In
a country where offices are created solely for the benefit of the
people no one man has any more intrinsic right to official station
than another."[173] Jackson believed that rotating political
appointments would prevent the development of a corrupt
bureaucracy. The number of federal office holders removed by
Jackson were exaggerated by his opponents; Jackson rotated only
about 20% of federal office holders during his first term, some for
dereliction of duty rather than political purposes.[174] Jackson,
nonetheless, used his presidential power to award loyal
Democrats by granting them federal office appointments.
Jackson's  approach incorporated patriotism for country as
qualification for holding office. Having appointed a soldier who
had lost his leg fighting on the battlefield to postmaster, Jackson
stated, "[i]f he lost his leg fighting for his country, that is ...
enough for me."[175]
Jackson's theory regarding rotation of office generated what
would later be called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoils_system"] spoils system.[172] The political realities of Washington sometimes forced Jackson
to make partisan appointments despite his personal reservations.[176] Supervision of bureaus and
departments whose operations were outside of Washington (such as the New York Customs House; the
Postal Service; the Departments of Navy and War; and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, whose budget had
increased enormously in the previous two decades) proved to be difficult.[177] Remini writes that because
"friendship, politics, and geography constituted the President's total criteria for appointments, most of his
appointments were predictably substandard."[178]
Petticoat affair
Jackson devoted a considerable amount of his presidential time during his early years in office responding
to what came to be known as the "Petticoat affair" or "Eaton affair."[179] Washington gossip circulated
among Jackson's cabinet members and their wives, including Calhoun's wife [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floride_Calhoun"] Floride Calhoun, concerning
Secretary of War Eaton and his wife [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_O%27Neill_Eaton"] Peggy Eaton. Salacious rumors held that Peggy, as a barmaid in her
father's tavern, had been sexually promiscuous or had even been a prostitute.[180] Controversy also ensued
because Peggy had married soon after her previous husband's death, and it was alleged that she and her
husband had engaged in an adulterous affair while her previous husband was still living.[181] Petticoat
politics emerged when the wives of cabinet members, led by Mrs. Calhoun, refused to socialize with the
Eatons. Allowing a prostitute in the official family was unthinkable—but Jackson refused to believe the
rumors, telling his Cabinet that "She is as chaste as a virgin!"[180] Jackson believed that the dishonorable
people were the rumormongers, who in essence questioned and dishonored Jackson himself by, in
attempting to drive the Eatons out, daring to tell him who he could and could not have in his cabinet.
Jackson was also reminded of the attacks that were made against his wife. These memories increased his
dedication to defending Peggy Eaton.[182]
Meanwhile, the cabinet wives insisted that the interests and honor of all American women was at stake.
They believed a responsible woman should never accord a man sexual favors without the assurance that
 went with marriage. A woman who broke that code was dishonorable and unacceptable. Historian Daniel
Walker Howe notes that this was the feminist spirit that in the next decade shaped the woman's rights
movement. Secretary of State Martin Van Buren, a widower, was already forming a coalition against
Calhoun. He could now see his main chance to strike hard; he took the side of Jackson and Eaton.[183]
Page 18
In the spring of 1831, Jackson, at Van Buren's suggestion, demanded the resignations of all the cabinet
members except Barry. Van Buren himself resigned to avoid the appearance of bias. In 1832, Jackson
nominated Van Buren to be Minister to Great Britain. Calhoun blocked the nomination with a tie-breaking
vote against it, claiming the defeated nomination would "... kill him [Van Buren] dead, sir, kill him dead.
He will never kick, sir, never kick."[184] Van Buren continued to serve as an important adviser to Jackson
and was placed on the ticket for vice president in the 1832 election, making him Jackson's heir-
apparent.[134] The Petticoat affair led to the development of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_Cabinet"] Kitchen Cabinet. The Kitchen Cabinet
emerged as an unofficial group of advisors to the president. Its existence was partially rooted in Jackson's
difficulties with his official cabinet, even after the purging.[185]
Indian removal policy
Throughout his eight years in office, Jackson made about 70
treaties with American Indian tribes both in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Southwest"] South and in
the Northwest.[186] Jackson's  presidency marked the
beginning of a policy of Indian removal.[184] Jackson
himself sometimes participated in the treaty negotiating
process, though other times he left the negotiations to his
subordinates. The southern tribes included the Choctaw,
Creek, Chickasaw, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole"] Seminole and the Cherokee. The
northwest tribes included the Chippewa, Ottawa, and the
Potawatomi.[187]
Relations between Indians and whites increasingly grew
tense and sometimes violent as a result of territorial
conflicts.[184] Previous presidents had at times supported
removal or attempts to "civilize" Native people,[188] but 
Jackson's Indian Removal Act and
subsequent treaties resulted in the forced
removal of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Civilized_Tribes"] major tribes of the Southeast
from their traditional territories, many along
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears"] Trail of Tears.
generally let the problem play itself out with minimal
intervention. But by Jackson's time, a growing popular and
political movement developed wanting action on the issue, and out of this came policy decisions to relocate
certain Indian populations. Jackson, never known for timidity, became an advocate for this relocation policy
in what many historians consider the most controversial aspect of his presidency.[184]
In his First Annual Message to Congress, Jackson advocated land west of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River"] Mississippi River be set aside
for Indian tribes. On May 26, 1830, Congress passed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Removal_Act"] Indian Removal Act, which Jackson signed into
law two days later. The Act authorized the president to negotiate treaties to buy tribal lands in the east in
exchange for lands farther west, outside of existing state borders.[186] The act specifically pertained to the
 Five Civilized Tribes in the South, the conditions being that they could either move west or stay and obey
state law, effectively relinquishing their sovereignty.[189]
Jackson, Eaton, and General Coffee negotiated with the Chickasaw, who quickly agreed to move.[190]
Jackson put Eaton and Coffee in charge of negotiating with the Choctaw. Lacking Jackson's skills at
negotiation, they simply bribed various leaders in order to gain their agreement. The tactics worked, and
with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Dancing_Rabbit_Creek"] Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, the Choctaw were required to move. The removal of the
Choctaw took place in the winter of 1831 and 1832, and was wrought with misery and suffering.[191] The
Seminole, despite the signing of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Payne%27s_Landing"] Treaty of Payne's Landing in 1832,[192] refused to move. In December
1835, this dispute began the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Seminole_War"] Second Seminole War. The war lasted over six years, finally ending in
1842.[187] Members of the Creek Nation had signed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Cusseta"] Treaty of Cusseta in 1832, allowing the Creek to
either sell or retain their land.[193] Conflict later erupted between the Creek who remained and the white
Page 19
settlers, leading to a second [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creek_War_of_1836"] Creek War.[194] A common complaint
amongst the tribes was that the men who had signed the treaties did
not represent the whole tribe.[187][194]
The state of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)"] Georgia became involved in a dispute with the
Cherokee, culminating in the 1832 Supreme Court decision in
 Worcester v. Georgia. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States"] Chief Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall"] John Marshall, writing for the
court, ruled that Georgia could not forbid whites from entering
tribal lands, as it had attempted to do with two missionaries
supposedly stirring up resistance amongst the tribespeople.[195]
Jackson is frequently attributed the following response: "John
Marshall has made his decision, now let him enforce it." The quote,
apparently indicating Jackson's dismissive view of the courts, was
attributed to Jackson by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Greeley"] Horace Greeley, who cited as his source
Portrait of Jackson by Earl, 1830 
Representative [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_N._Briggs"] George N. Briggs. Remini argues that Jackson did
not say it because, while it "certainly sounds like Jackson...[t]here
 was nothing for him to enforce." This is because a writ of habeas
corpus had never been issued for the missionaries.[196] The Court also did not ask [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_marshal"] federal marshals to carry
out the decision, as had become standard.[197]
A group of Cherokees led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ridge"] John Ridge negotiated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_New_Echota"] Treaty of New Echota. Ridge was not a widely
recognized leader of the Cherokee, and this document was rejected by some as illegitimate.[198] Another
faction, led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ross_(Cherokee_chief)"] John Ross, unsuccessfully petitioned to protest the proposed removal.[199] The Cherokee
largely considered themselves independent, and not subject to the laws of the United States or Georgia.[200]
The treaty was enforced by Jackson's successor, Van Buren. Subsequently, as many as 4,000 out of 18,000
Cherokee died on the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears"] Trail of Tears" in 1838.[201]
More than 45,000 people were relocated, primarily to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_territory"] Indian territory in present-day [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma"] Oklahoma during
Jackson's administration, though [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Band_of_Cherokee_Indians"] some Cherokee people walked back afterwards, and others evaded
removal by migrating into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smoky_Mountains"] Great Smoky Mountains.[202] Another conflict during the Jackson
administration was the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk_War"] Black Hawk War in 1832 after a group of Indians crossed into U.S. territory.[203]
Nullification crisis
In 1828, Congress had approved the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_Abominations"] Tariff of Abominations", which set the tariff at a historically high
rate. Southern planters, who sold their cotton on the world market, strongly opposed this tariff, which they
saw as favoring northern interests. The South now had to pay more for goods it did not produce locally;
and other countries would have more difficulty affording southern cotton. The issue came to a head during
Jackson's presidency, resulting in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullification_Crisis"] Nullification Crisis, in which South Carolina threatened disunion.[204]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Exposition_and_Protest"] South Carolina Exposition and Protest of 1828, secretly written by Calhoun, asserted that their state
had the right to "nullify"—declare void—the tariff legislation of 1828. Although Jackson sympathized with
the South in the tariff debate, he also vigorously supported a strong union, with effective powers for the
central government. Jackson attempted to face down Calhoun over the issue, which developed into a bitter
rivalry between the two men. One incident came at the April 13, 1830, Jefferson Day dinner, involving
after-dinner toasts. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hayne"] Robert Hayne began by toasting to "The Union of the States, and the Sovereignty of the
States." Jackson then rose, and in a booming voice added "Our federal Union: It must be preserved!" – a
clear challenge to Calhoun. Calhoun clarified his position by responding "The Union: Next to our Liberty,
the most dear!"[205]
Page 20
In May 1830, Jackson discovered that Calhoun had asked President Monroe to censure Jackson for his
invasion of Spanish Florida in 1818 while Calhoun was serving as Secretary of War. Calhoun's and
Jackson's relationship deteriorated further. By February 1831, the break between Calhoun and Jackson was
final. Responding to inaccurate press reports about the feud, Calhoun had published letters between him
and Jackson detailing the conflict in the United States Telegraph. Jackson and Calhoun began an angry
correspondence which lasted until Jackson stopped it in July.[134] The Telegraph, edited by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duff_Green"] Duff Green,
initially supported Jackson. After it sided with Calhoun on nullification, Jackson needed a new organ for
the administration. He enlisted the help of longtime supporter [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Preston_Blair"] Francis Preston Blair, who in November
1830 established a newspaper known as the Washington Globe, which from then on served as the primary
mouthpiece of the Democratic Party.[206]
Jackson supported a revision to tariff rates known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_1832"] Tariff of 1832. It was designed to placate the
nullifiers by lowering tariff rates. Written by Treasury Secretary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_McLane"] Louis McLane, the bill lowered duties from
45% to 27%. In May, Representative John Quincy Adams introduced a slightly revised version of the bill,
which Jackson accepted. It passed Congress on July 9 and was signed by the president on July 14. The bill
failed to satisfy extremists on either side.[207] On November 24, the South Carolina legislature nullified
both the Tariff of 1832 and the Tariff of 1828.[208] In response, Jackson sent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy"] U.S. Navy warships to
 Charleston harbor, and threatened to hang any man who worked to support nullification or secession.[209]
On December 28, 1832, Calhoun resigned as vice president, after having been elected to the U.S.
Senate.[210][b] This was part of a strategy whereby Calhoun, with less than three months remaining on his
vice presidential term, would replace [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Y._Hayne"] Robert Y. Hayne in the Senate, and he would then become governor
of South Carolina. Hayne had often struggled to defend nullification on the floor of the Senate, especially
against fierce criticism from Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Webster"] Daniel Webster of Massachusetts.[212]
Also that December, Jackson issued a resounding proclamation against the "nullifiers," stating that he
considered "the power to annul a law of the United States, assumed by one State, incompatible with the
existence of the Union, contradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized by its spirit,
inconsistent with every principle on which it was founded, and destructive of the great object for which it
was formed." South Carolina, the president declared, stood on "the brink of insurrection and treason," and
he appealed to the people of the state to reassert their allegiance to that Union for which their ancestors had
fought. Jackson also denied the right of secession: "The Constitution ... forms a government not a league ...
To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States are not a
nation."[213] Jackson tended to personalize the controversy, frequently characterizing nullification as a
conspiracy between disappointed and bitter men whose ambitions had been thwarted.[214]
Jackson asked Congress to pass a "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_Bill"] Force Bill" explicitly authorizing the use of military force to enforce the
tariff. It was introduced by Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Grundy"] Felix Grundy of Tennessee, and was quickly attacked by Calhoun as
"military despotism."[215] At the same time, Calhoun and Clay began to work on a new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_1833"] compromise tariff.
A bill sponsored by the administration had been introduced by Representative [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulian_C._Verplanck"] Gulian C. Verplanck of New
York, but it lowered rates more sharply than Clay and other protectionists desired. Clay managed to get
Calhoun to agree to a bill with higher rates in exchange for Clay's opposition to Jackson's military threats
and, perhaps, with the hope that he could win some Southern votes in his next bid for the presidency.[216]
The Compromise Tariff passed on March 1, 1833.[217] The Force Bill passed the same day. Calhoun, Clay,
 and several others marched out of the chamber in opposition, the only dissenting vote coming from John
Tyler of Virginia.[218] The new tariff was opposed by Webster, who argued that it essentially surrendered to
South Carolina's demands.[219] Jackson, despite his anger over the scrapping of the Verplanck bill and the
new alliance between Clay and Calhoun, saw it as an efficient way to end the crisis. He signed both bills
on March 2, starting with the Force Bill.[220] The South Carolina Convention then met and rescinded its
nullification ordinance, but in a final show of defiance, nullified the Force Bill.[217] On May 1, Jackson
wrote, "the tariff was only the pretext, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession_in_the_United_States"] disunion and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America"] southern confederacy the real object. The next
pretext will be the negro, or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery_in_the_United_States"] slavery question."[217]
Page 21
Foreign affairs
Addressing the subject of foreign affairs in his First Annual
Address to Congress, Jackson declared it to be his "settled purpose
to ask nothing that is not clearly right and to submit to nothing that
is wrong."[168]
When Jackson took office, spoliation claims, or compensation
demands for the capture of American ships and sailors, dating from
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon"] Napoleonic era, caused strained relations between the U.S. and
French governments. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Navy"] French Navy had captured and sent
American ships to Spanish ports while holding their crews captive
forcing them to labor without any charges or judicial rules.
According to Secretary of State [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren"] Martin Van Buren, relations
between the U.S. and France were "hopeless."[221] Jackson's
Minister to France, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cabell_Rives"] William C. Rives, through diplomacy was able
to convince the French government to sign a reparations treaty on
July 4, 1831, that would award the U.S. ₣ 25,000,000 ($5,000,000)
in damages.[222] The French government became delinquent in
payment due to internal financial and political difficulties. The
French king [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Philippe_I"] Louis Philippe I and his ministers blamed the French

Chamber of Deputies. By 1834, the non-payment of reparations by
 the French government drew Jackson's ire and he became impatient. In his December 1834 State of the
Union address, Jackson sternly reprimanded the French government for non-payment, stating the federal
government was "wholly disappointed" by the French, and demanded Congress authorize trade reprisals
against France.[223] Feeling insulted by Jackson's words, the French people began pressuring their
government not to pay the indemnity until Jackson had apologized for his remarks.[224] In his December
1835 State of the Union Address, Jackson refused to apologize, stating he had a good opinion of the
French people and his intentions were peaceful. Jackson described in lengthy and minute detail the history
of events surrounding the treaty and his belief that the French government was purposely stalling payment.
The French accepted Jackson's statements as sincere and in February 1836, reparations were paid.[225]
In addition to France, the Jackson administration successfully settled spoliation claims with Denmark,
Portugal, and Spain. Jackson's state department was active and successful at making trade agreements with
Russia, Spain, Turkey, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland"] United Kingdom, and Siam. Under the treaty with the United Kingdom,
American trade was reopened in the West Indies. The trade agreement with Siam was America's first treaty
between the United States and an Asiatic country. As a result, American exports increased 75% while
imports increased 250%.[225]
Jackson's attempt to purchase Texas from Mexico for $5,000,000 failed. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charg%C3%A9_d%27affaires"] chargé d'affaires in Mexico,
Colonel Anthony Butler, suggested that the U.S. take Texas over militarily, but Jackson refused. Butler was
later replaced toward the end of Jackson's presidency. In 1835, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Revolution"] Texas Revolution began when pro-
slavery American settlers in Texas fought the Mexican government for Texan independence. By May 1836,
they had routed the Mexican military, establishing an independent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Texas"] Republic of Texas. The new Texas
government legalized slavery and demanded recognition from President Jackson and annexation into the
United States. Jackson was hesitant in recognizing Texas, unconvinced that the new republic could
maintain independence from Mexico, and not wanting to make Texas an anti-slavery issue during the 1836
election. The strategy worked; the Democratic Party and national loyalties were held intact, and Van Buren
 was elected president. Jackson formally recognized the Republic of Texas, nominating Alcée Louis la
Branche as chargé d'affaires on the last full day of his presidency, March 3, 1837.[225]
Page 22
Jackson failed in his efforts to open trade with China and Japan and was unsuccessful at thwarting the
United Kingdom's presence and power in South America.[225]
Bank veto and election of 1832
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1832_United_States_presidential_election"] 1832 presidential election demonstrated the rapid development
and organization of political parties during this time period. The
Democratic Party's first national convention, held in Baltimore,
nominated Jackson's choice for vice president, Van Buren. The
National Republican Party, who had held their first convention in
Baltimore earlier in December 1831, nominated Henry Clay, now a
senator from Kentucky, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sergeant_(politician)"] John Sergeant of Pennsylvania.[226]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Masonic_Party"] Anti-Masonic Party emerged by capitalizing on opposition to
Freemasonry, which existed primarily in New England, after the
disappearance and possible murder of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morgan_(anti-Mason)"] William Morgan.[227] The
party, which had earlier held its convention also in Baltimore in
 September 1831, nominated William Wirt of Maryland and Amos
Ellmaker of Pennsylvania. Clay was, like Jackson, a Mason, and so
some anti-Jacksonians who would have supported the National
Republican Party supported Wirt instead.[228] 
1832 election results
In 1816, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States"] Second Bank of the United States was chartered by President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison to restore the
United States economy devastated by the War of 1812.[229] Monroe had appointed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Biddle_(banker)"] Nicholas Biddle as the
Bank's executive.[230] Jackson believed that the Bank was a fundamentally corrupt monopoly. Its stock
was mostly held by foreigners, he insisted, and it exerted an unfair amount of control over the political
system. Jackson used the issue to promote his democratic values, believing the Bank was being run
exclusively for the wealthy. Jackson stated the Bank made "the rich richer and the potent more
powerful."[230] He accused it of making loans with the intent of influencing elections.[231] In his address to
Congress in 1830, Jackson called for a substitute for the Bank that would have no private stockholders and
no ability to lend or purchase land. Its only power would be to issue bills of exchange.[232] The address
touched off fiery debate in the Senate. Thomas Hart Benton, now a strong supporter of the president
despite the brawl years earlier, gave a speech excoriating the Bank and calling for debate on its recharter.
Webster led a motion to narrowly defeat the resolution. Shortly afterward, the Globe announced that
Jackson would stand for reelection.[233]
Despite his misgivings about the Bank, Jackson supported a plan proposed in late 1831 by his moderately
pro-Bank Treasury Secretary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_McLane"] Louis McLane, who was secretly working with Biddle, to recharter a
reformed version of the Bank in a way that would free up funds which would in turn be used to strengthen
the military or pay off the nation's debt. This would be done, in part, through the sale of government stock
in the Bank. Over the objections of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General"] Attorney General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_B._Taney"] Roger B. Taney, an irreconcilable opponent of the
Bank, he allowed McLane to publish a Treasury Report which essentially recommended rechartering the
Bank.[234]
Clay hoped to make the Bank an issue in the election, so as to accuse Jackson of going beyond his powers
if he vetoed a recharter bill. He and Webster urged Biddle to immediately apply for recharter rather than
wait to reach a compromise with the administration.[235] Biddle received advice to the contrary from
moderate Democrats such as McLane and William Lewis, who argued that Biddle should wait because
Jackson would likely veto the recharter bill. On January 6, 1832, Biddle submitted to Congress a renewal
of the Bank's charter without any of the proposed reforms.[236] The submission came four years before the
original 20-year charter was to end. Biddle's recharter bill passed the Senate on June 11 and the House on
July 3, 1832.[230] Jackson determined to veto it. Many moderate Democrats, including McLane, were
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wirt_(Attorney_General)"]
Page 23
appalled by the perceived arrogance of the bill and supported his
decision. When Van Buren met Jackson on July 4, Jackson
declared, "The Bank, Mr. Van Buren, is trying to kill me. But I will
kill it."[237] Jackson vetoed the bill on July 10. The veto message
was crafted primarily by Taney, Kendall, and Jackson's nephew
and advisor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson_Donelson"] Andrew Jackson Donelson. It attacked the Bank as an
agent of inequality that supported only the wealthy.[238] The veto
was considered "one of the strongest and most controversial"
presidential statements[239] and "a brilliant political manifesto."[240]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Republican_Party"] National Republican Party immediately made Jackson's veto of
the Bank a political issue.[228] Jackson's political opponents
castigated the veto as "the very slang of the leveller and
demagogue," claiming Jackson was using class warfare to gain
support from the common man.[230] 
1833 Democratic cartoon shows
Jackson destroying the "Devil's
Bank"
At Biddle's direction, the Bank poured thousands of dollars into a campaign to defeat Jackson, seemingly
confirming Jackson's view that it interfered in the political process.[241] Jackson successfully portrayed his
veto as a defense of the common man against governmental tyranny. Clay proved to be no match for
Jackson's ability to resonate with the people and the Democratic Party's strong political networks.
Democratic newspapers, parades, barbecues, and rallies increased Jackson's popularity.[242] Jackson
himself made numerous public appearances on his return trip from Tennessee to Washington, D.C. He won
the election by a landslide, receiving 54 percent of the popular vote and 219 electoral votes. Clay received
37 percent of the popular vote and 49 electoral votes. Wirt received only eight percent of the popular vote
and seven electoral votes while the Anti-Masonic Party eventually declined.[243] Jackson believed the solid
victory was a popular mandate for his veto of the Bank's recharter and his continued warfare on the Bank's
control over the national economy.[244]
Removal of deposits and censure
In 1833, Jackson attempted to begin removing federal deposits from the bank, whose money-lending
functions were taken over by the legions of local and state banks that materialized across America, thus
drastically increasing credit and speculation.[245] Jackson's moves were greatly controversial. He removed
 McLane from the Treasury Department, having him serve instead as Secretary of State, replacing Edward
Livingston. He replaced McLane with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Duane"] William J. Duane.[246] In September, he fired Duane for refusing to
remove the deposits. Signalling his intent to continue battling the Bank, he replaced Duane with Taney.[247]
Under Taney, the deposits began to be removed.[245] They were placed in a variety of state banks which
were friendly to the administration's policies, known to critics as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_banks"] pet banks.[248] Biddle responded by
stockpiling the Bank's reserves and contracting credit, thus causing interest rates to rise and bringing about
a financial panic. The moves were intended to force Jackson into a compromise. "Nothing but the evidence
of suffering abroad will produce any effect in Congress," he wrote. At first, Biddle's strategy was
successful, putting enormous pressure on Jackson.[249] But Jackson handled the situation well. When
people came to him complaining, he referred them to Biddle, saying that he was the man who had "all the
money."[250] Jackson's  approach worked. Biddle's  strategy backfired, increasing anti-Bank
sentiment.[251][252]
 In 1834, those who disagreed with Jackson's expansion of executive power united and formed the Whig
Party, calling Jackson "King Andrew I," and named their party after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whigs_(British_political_party)"] English Whigs who [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorious_Revolution"] opposed
seventeenth century British monarchy.[253] A movement emerged among Whigs in the Senate to censure
Jackson. The censure was a political maneuver spearheaded by Clay, which served only to perpetuate the
animosity between him and Jackson.[254] Jackson called Clay "reckless and as full of fury as a drunken
Page 24
man in a brothel."[255] On March 28, the Senate voted to censure Jackson 26–20.[256] It also rejected
Taney as Treasury Secretary.[257] The House however, led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Ways_and_Means"] Ways and Means Committee chairman
 James K. Polk, declared on April 4 that the Bank "ought not to be rechartered" and that the depositions
"ought not to be restored." It voted to continue allowing pet banks to be places of deposit and voted even
more overwhelmingly to investigate whether the Bank had deliberately instigated the panic. Jackson called
the passage of these resolutions a "glorious triumph." It essentially sealed the Bank's demise.[258] The
 Democrats later suffered a temporary setback. Polk ran for Speaker of the House to replace Andrew
Stevenson. After Southerners discovered his connection to Van Buren, he was defeated by fellow-
Tennessean [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bell_(Tennessee_politician)"] John Bell, a Democrat-turned-Whig who opposed Jackson's removal policy.[259]
Payment of US national debt
The national economy following the withdrawal of the remaining funds from the Bank was booming and
the federal government through duty revenues and sale of public lands was able to pay all bills. On January
1, 1835, Jackson paid off the entire national debt, the only time in U.S. history that has been
accomplished.[260][261] The objective had been reached in part through Jackson's reforms aimed at
eliminating the misuse of funds and through his vetoes of legislation which he deemed extravagant.[262] In
December 1835, Polk defeated Bell in a rematch and was elected Speaker.[263] Finally, on January 16,
1837, when the Jacksonians had a majority in the Senate, the censure was expunged after years of effort by
Jackson supporters.[254] The expunction movement was led, ironically, by Benton.[264]
In 1836, in response to increased land speculation, Jackson issued the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specie_Circular"] Specie Circular, an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)"] executive order
that required buyers of government lands to pay in "specie" (gold or silver coins). The result was high
 demand for specie, which many banks could not meet in exchange for their notes, contributing to the Panic
of 1837.[265] The White House Van Buren biography notes, "Basically the trouble was the 19th-century
cyclical economy of 'boom and bust,'  which was following its regular pattern, but Jackson's financial
measures contributed to the crash. His destruction of the Second Bank of the United States had removed
restrictions upon the inflationary practices of some state banks; wild speculation in lands, based on easy
bank credit, had swept the West. To end this speculation, Jackson in 1836 had issued a Specie
Circular ..."[266]
Attack and assassination attempt
The first recorded physical attack on a U.S. president was directed
at Jackson. He had ordered the dismissal of Robert B. Randolph
from the navy for embezzlement. On May 6, 1833, Jackson sailed
on USS Cygnet to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredericksburg,_Virginia"] Fredericksburg, Virginia, where he was to lay
 the cornerstone on a monument near the grave of Mary Ball
Washington, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"] George Washington's mother. During a stopover near
Alexandria, Randolph appeared and struck the president. He fled
the scene chased by several members of Jackson's party, including
the writer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Irving"] Washington Irving. Jackson declined to press charges.[23] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lawrence_(failed_assassin)"] Richard Lawrence's attempt on
Jackson's life, as depicted in an
On January 30, 1835, what is believed to be the first attempt to kill 1835 etching
a sitting president of the United States occurred just outside the
 United States Capitol. When Jackson was leaving through the East
Portico after the funeral of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina"] South Carolina Representative [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_R._Davis"] Warren R. Davis, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lawrence_(failed_assassin)"] Richard Lawrence, an
unemployed house painter from England, aimed a pistol at Jackson, which misfired. Lawrence then pulled
out a second pistol, which also misfired. Historians believe the humid weather contributed to the double
Page 25
 misfiring.[267] Jackson, infuriated, attacked Lawrence with his cane, until others present, including Davy
Crockett, fearing that the president would beat Lawrence to a pulp, intervened to restrain and disarm
Lawrence.[268][269]
Lawrence offered a variety of explanations for the attempted shooting. He blamed Jackson for the loss of
his job. He claimed that with the president dead, "money would be more plenty," (a reference to Jackson's
struggle with the Bank of the United States) and that he "could not rise until the President fell." Finally,
Lawrence told his interrogators that he was a deposed English king—specifically, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_III_of_England"] Richard III, dead since
1485—and that Jackson was his clerk.[270] He was deemed insane and was institutionalized at the
 Government Hospital for the Insane in Washington, D.C.[271][272]
Afterwards, the pistols were tested and retested. Each time they performed perfectly. Many believed that
Jackson had been protected by the same [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_providence"] Providence that also protected their young nation. The incident
became a part of Jacksonian mythos. Jackson initially suspected that a number of his political enemies
might have orchestrated the attempt on his life. His suspicions were never proven.[273]
Reaction to anti-slavery tracts
During the summer of 1835, Northern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism"] abolitionists began sending anti-slavery tracts through the postal
system into the South.[274] Pro-slavery Southerners demanded that the postal service ban distribution of the
materials, which were deemed "incendiary," and some began to riot. Jackson wanted sectional peace, and
desired to placate Southerners ahead of the 1836 election.[275] He fiercely disliked the abolitionists, whom
he believed were, by instituting sectional jealousies, attempting to destroy the Union.[276] Jackson also did
not want to condone open insurrection. He supported the solution of Postmaster General Amos Kendall,
which gave Southern postmasters discretionary powers to either send or detain the anti-slavery tracts.[275]
That December, Jackson called on Congress to prohibit the circulation through the South of "incendiary
publications intended to instigate the slaves to insurrection."[277]
U.S. exploring expedition
Jackson initially opposed any federal exploratory scientific
expeditions during his first term in office.[278] The last scientific
federally funded expeditions took place from 1817 to 1823, led by
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Harriman_Long"] Stephen H. Harriman west of the Mississippi. Jackson's
predecessor, President Adams, attempted to launch a scientific
oceanic exploration in 1828, but Congress was unwilling to fund
the effort. When Jackson assumed office in 1829 he pocketed
Adams' expedition plans. Eventually, wanting to establish his
 presidential legacy, similar to Jefferson and the Lewis and Clark
Expedition, Jackson sponsored scientific exploration during his
second term. On May 18, 1836, Jackson signed a law creating and
funding the oceanic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Exploring_Expedition"] United States Exploring Expedition. Jackson 
 USS Porpoise, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brig"] brig ship laid down

put Secretary of the Navy [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahlon_Dickerson"] Mahlon Dickerson in charge, to
assemble suitable ships, officers, and scientific staff for the
expedition; with a planned launch before Jackson's term of office expired. Dickerson proved unfit for the
task, preparations stalled and the expedition was not launched until 1838, during the presidency of Van
Buren.[278] One [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brig"] brig ship, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Porpoise_(1836)"] USS  Porpoise, later used in the expedition; having been commissioned by
 Secretary Dickerson in May 1836, circumnavigated the world and explored and mapped the Southern
Ocean, confirming the existence of the continent of Antarctica.[279]

Panic of 1837
In spite of economic success following Jackson's vetoes and war
against the Bank, reckless speculation in land and railroads
eventually caused the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1837"] Panic of 1837.[280] Contributing factors
included Jackson's veto of the Second National Bank renewal
charter in 1832 and subsequent transfer of federal monies to state
banks in 1833 that caused western banks to relax their lending
standards. Two other Jacksonian acts in 1836 contributed to the
Panic of 1837: the Specie Circular, which mandated western lands
only be purchased by money backed by gold and silver, and the
Deposit and Distribution Act, which transferred federal monies
from eastern to western state banks and in turn led to a speculation

frenzy by banks. Jackson's Specie Circular, albeit designed to
reduce speculation and stabilize the economy, left many investors
unable to afford to pay loans in gold and silver. The same year there was a downturn in Great Britain's
economy that stopped investment in the United States. As a result, the U.S. economy went into a
depression, banks became insolvent, the national debt (previously paid off) increased, business failures
rose, cotton prices dropped, and unemployment dramatically increased.[280] The depression that followed
lasted for four years until 1841, when the economy began to rebound.[260][281]

Judicial appointments
Jackson appointed six justices to the Supreme Court.[283] Most were undistinguished. His first appointee,
 John McLean, had been nominated in Barry's place after Barry had agreed to become postmaster
general.[284] McLean "turned Whig and forever schemed to win" the presidency. His next two appointees–
 Henry Baldwin and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Moore_Wayne"] James Moore Wayne–disagreed with Jackson on some points but were poorly regarded
even by Jackson's enemies.[178] In reward for his services, Jackson nominated Taney to the Court to fill a
vacancy in January 1835, but the nomination failed to win Senate approval.[284] Chief Justice Marshall
 died in 1835, leaving two vacancies on the court. Jackson nominated Taney for Chief Justice and Philip P.
Barbour for associate justice. Both were confirmed by the new Senate.[285] Taney served as chief justice
until 1864, presiding over a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taney_Court"] court that upheld many of the precedents set by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Court"] Marshall Court.[286] He
 was regarded with respect over the course of his career on the bench, but his opinion in Dred Scott v.
Sandford largely overshadows his other accomplishments.[287] On the last full day of his presidency,
Jackson nominated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Catron"] John Catron, who was confirmed.[288]
States admitted to the Union
Two new states were admitted into the Union during Jackson's presidency: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas"] Arkansas (June 15, 1836)[289]
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan"] Michigan (January 26, 1837).[290] Both states increased Democratic power in Congress and helped
Van Buren win the presidency in 1836. This was in keeping with the tradition that new states would
support the party which had done the most to admit them.[291]
Later life and death (1837–1845)
Page 28
In 1837, after serving two terms as
president, Jackson was replaced by his
chosen successor Martin Van Buren and
retired to the Hermitage. He immediately
began putting it in order as it had been
poorly managed in his absence by his
adopted son, Andrew Jackson Jr.
Although he experienced ill health,
Jackson remained highly influential in
both national and state politics.[292] He
was a firm advocate of the federal union Two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daguerreotype"] daguerreotypes of Jackson, 1844–45, Unknown photographer
of the states and rejected any talk of
secession, insisting, "I will die with the
Union."[293] Blamed for causing the Panic of 1837, he was unpopular in his early retirement. Jackson
continued to denounce the "perfidy and treachery" of banks and urged his successor, Van Buren, to
repudiate the Specie Circular as president.[292]
As a solution to the panic, he supported an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Treasury"] Independent Treasury system, which was designed to hold the
 money balances of the government in the form of gold or silver and would be restricted from printing paper
money so as to prevent further inflation.[294] A coalition of conservative Democrats and Whigs opposed
the bill, and it was not passed until 1840. During the delay, no effective remedy had been implemented for
the depression. Van Buren grew deeply unpopular. A unified Whig Party nominated popular war hero
 William Henry Harrison and former Jacksonian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyler"] John Tyler in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1840_United_States_presidential_election"] 1840 presidential election. The Whigs'
campaign style in many ways mimicked that of the Democrats when Jackson ran. They depicted Van
Buren as an aristocrat who did not care for the concerns of ordinary Americans, while glorifying Harrison's
military record and portraying him as a man of the people. Jackson campaigned heavily for Van Buren in
 Tennessee.[295] He favored the nomination of Polk for vice president at the 1840 Democratic National
Convention over controversial incumbent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mentor_Johnson"] Richard Mentor Johnson. No nominee was chosen, and the party
chose to leave the decision up to individual state electors.[296]
Harrison won the election, and the Whigs captured majorities in both houses of Congress. "The democracy
of the United States has been shamefully beaten",  Jackson wrote to Van Buren, "but I trust, not
conquered."[297] Harrison died only a month into his term, and was replaced by Tyler. Jackson was
encouraged because Tyler had a strong independent streak and was not bound by party lines.[298] Tyler
quickly incurred the wrath of the Whigs in 1841 when he vetoed two Whig-sponsored bills to establish a
new national bank, bringing satisfaction to Jackson and other Democrats.[299] After the second veto,
Tyler's entire cabinet, with the exception of Webster, resigned.[300]
Jackson strongly favored the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Texas"] annexation of Texas, a feat he had been unable to accomplish during his own
presidency. While Jackson still feared that annexation would stir up anti-slavery sentiment, his belief that
the British would use Texas as a base to threaten the United States overrode his other concerns.[301] He
also insisted that Texas was part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase"] Louisiana Purchase and therefore rightfully belonged to the United
States.[302] At the request of Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Walker"] Robert J. Walker of Mississippi, acting on behalf of the Tyler
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Houston"] administration, which also supported annexation, Jackson wrote several letters to Texas president Sam
Houston, urging him to wait for the Senate to approve annexation and explaining how much being a part of
the United States would benefit Texas.[303] Initially prior to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1844_United_States_presidential_election"] 1844 election, Jackson again supported Van
Buren for president and Polk for vice president. A treaty of annexation was signed by Tyler on April 12,
1844, and submitted to the Senate. When a letter from Secretary of State Calhoun to British Ambassador
 Richard Pakenham linking annexation to slavery was made public, anti-annexation sentiment exploded in
the North and the bill failed to be ratified. Van Buren decided to write the "Hamlet letter," opposing
annexation. This effectively extinguished any support that Van Buren might previously have enjoyed in the
Page 29
South.[304] The Whig nominee, Henry Clay, also opposed annexation, and Jackson recognized the need for
the Democrats to nominate a candidate who supported it and could therefore gain the support of the South.
If the plan failed, Jackson warned, Texas would not join the Union and would potentially fall victim to a
Mexican invasion supported by the British.[305]
Jackson met with Polk, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Armstrong_(1792%E2%80%931854)"] Robert Armstrong, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson_Donelson"] Andrew Jackson Donelson in his study. He then pointed
directly at a startled Polk, telling him that, as a man from the southwest and a supporter of annexation, he
would be the perfect candidate. Polk called the scheme "utterly abortive", but agreed to go along with
it.[306] At the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1844_Democratic_National_Convention"] 1844 Democratic National Convention, Polk emerged as the party's nominee after Van Buren
failed to win the required two-thirds majority of delegates. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_M._Dallas"] George M. Dallas was selected for vice
president. Jackson convinced Tyler to drop his plans of running for re-election as an independent by
promising, as Tyler requested, to welcome the President and his allies back into the Democratic Party and
by instructing Blair to stop criticizing the President.[307] Polk won the election, defeating Clay.[301] A bill
of annexation was passed by Congress in February and signed by Tyler on March 1.[308]
Jackson's age and illness eventually overcame him. On June 8, 1845, he was surrounded by family and
friends at his deathbed. Jackson, startled by their sobbing, said, "What is the matter with my dear children?
Have I alarmed you? Oh, do not cry. Be good children and we will all meet in Heaven."[309] He died
immediately after at the age of 78 of chronic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropsy"] dropsy and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"] heart failure.[310][309] According to a newspaper
account from the Boon Lick Times, "[he] fainted whilst being removed from his chair to the bed ... but he
subsequently revived ... Gen. Jackson died at the Hermitage at 6 p.m. on Sunday the 8th instant. ... When
the messenger finally came, the old soldier, patriot and Christian was looking out for his approach. He is
gone, but his memory lives, and will continue to live."[311] In his will, Jackson left his entire estate to
Andrew Jackson Jr. except for specifically enumerated items that were left to various friends and family
members.[312]
Personal life
Family
Different children were taken care of and lived with the Jackson
family at one time or another. These included the two Creek
children the Jacksons called Charly or Charley[313] and
Theodore.[314][315] The Jacksons had two boys they considered as
adopted — Andrew Jackson Jr., the son of Rachel's brother Severn
Donelson, and Lyncoya, a Creek orphan adopted by Jackson after
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tallushatchee"] Battle of Tallushatchee. Lyncoya died of tuberculosis on July 1,
1828, at the age of sixteen.[316][315] 
Mezzotint after a Daguerreotype of
The Jacksons also acted as guardians for eight other children. John Jackson by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Brady"] Mathew Brady, April 15,
 Samuel Donelson, Daniel Smith Donelson, and Andrew Jackson 1845
Donelson were the sons of Rachel's brother Samuel Donelson, who
died in 1804. Andrew Jackson Hutchings was Rachel's orphaned
grand nephew. Caroline Butler, Eliza Butler, Edward Butler, and Anthony Butler were the orphaned
children of Edward Butler, a family friend. They came to live with the Jacksons after the death of their
father.[317]
The widower Jackson invited Rachel's niece [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Donelson"] Emily Donelson to serve as hostess at the White House. Emily
was married to Andrew Jackson Donelson, who acted as Jackson's private secretary and in 1856 ran for
vice president on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_Nothing"] American Party ticket. The relationship between the president and Emily became
Page 30
strained during the Petticoat affair, and the two became estranged for over a year. They eventually
reconciled and she resumed her duties as White House hostess. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Yorke_Jackson"] Sarah Yorke Jackson, the wife of Andrew
Jackson Jr., became co-hostess of the White House in 1834. It was the only time in history when two
women simultaneously acted as unofficial First Lady. Sarah took over all hostess duties after Emily died
from tuberculosis in 1836. Jackson used [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_Raps"] Rip Raps as a retreat.[318]
Temperament
Jackson's quick temper was notorious. Biographer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._W._Brands"] H. W. Brands
notes that his opponents were terrified of his temper: "Observers
likened him to a volcano, and only the most intrepid or recklessly
curious cared to see it erupt. ... His close associates all had stories
of his blood-curdling oaths, his summoning of the Almighty to
loose His wrath upon some miscreant, typically followed by his
own vow to hang the villain or blow him to perdition. Given his
record—in duels, brawls, mutiny trials, and summary hearings—
listeners had to take his vows seriously."[319]
On the last day of his presidency, Jackson admitted that he had but
two regrets, that he "had been unable to shoot Henry Clay or to
hang John C. Calhoun."[320] On his deathbed, he was once again
quoted as regretting that he had not hanged Calhoun for treason.
"My country would have sustained me in the act, and his fate
would have been a warning to traitors in all time to come," he
said.[321] Remini expresses the opinion that Jackson was typically
in control of his temper, and that he used his anger, along with his
fearsome reputation, as a tool to get what he wanted.[322]

Physical appearance
Jackson was a lean figure, standing at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall, and weighing between 130 and 140
pounds (59 and 64 kg) on average. Jackson also had an unruly shock of red hair, which had completely
grayed by the time he became president at age 61. He had penetrating deep blue eyes. Jackson was one of
the more sickly presidents, suffering from chronic headaches, abdominal pains, and a hacking cough. Much
of his trouble was caused by a musket ball in his lung that was never removed, that often brought up blood
and sometimes made his whole body shake.[120]
Religious faith
In 1838, Jackson became an official member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Presbyterian_Church_(Nashville)"] First Presbyterian Church in Nashville.[323] Both his
mother and his wife had been devout Presbyterians all their lives, but Jackson himself had postponed
officially entering the church in order to avoid accusations that he had joined only for political reasons.[324]
Freemasonry
Jackson was a Freemason, initiated at Harmony Lodge No. 1 in Tennessee. He was elected [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Master_(Masonic)"] Grand Master
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Lodge_of_Tennessee"] Grand Lodge of Tennessee in 1822 and 1823.[325] During the 1832 presidential election, Jackson
faced opposition from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Masonic_Party"] Anti-Masonic Party. He was the only U.S. president to have served as Grand
Page 31
Master of a state's Grand Lodge until [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman"] Harry S. Truman in 1945. His
Masonic apron is on display in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_State_Museum"] Tennessee State Museum. An obelisk
and bronze Masonic plaque decorate his tomb at the
Hermitage.[326][327][328]
Legacy
Historical reputation
Jackson remains one of the most studied and controversial figures in
American history. Historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Grier_Sellers"] Charles Grier Sellers says, "Andrew Jackson's
masterful personality was enough by itself to make him one of the most 
Andrew Jackson as Grand
Master of Tennessee, 1822
controversial figures ever to stride across the American stage." There has
never been universal agreement on Jackson's legacy, for "his opponents
have ever been his most bitter enemies, and his friends almost his worshippers."[329] He was always a
fierce partisan, with many friends and many enemies. He has been lauded as the champion of the common
man, while criticized for his treatment of Indians and for other matters.[330] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Parton"] James Parton was the first man
after Jackson's death to write a full biography of him. Trying to sum up the contradictions in his subject, he
wrote:
Andrew Jackson, I am given to understand, was a patriot and a traitor. He was one of the
greatest generals, and wholly ignorant of the art of war. A brilliant writer, elegant, eloquent,
without being able to compose a correct sentence or spell words of four syllables. The first of
statesmen, he never devised, he never framed, a measure. He was the most candid of men, and
was capable of the most profound dissimulation. A most law-defying law-obeying citizen. A
stickler for discipline, he never hesitated to disobey his superior. A democratic autocrat. An
urbane savage. An atrocious saint.[331]
Jackson was criticized by his contemporary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville"] Alexis de Tocqueville in his 1835 book [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_in_America"] Democracy in America
for flattering the dominant ideas of his time, including the mistrust over the federal power, for sometimes
enforcing his view by force and disrespect towards the institutions and the law:
Far from wishing to extend the Federal power, the President belongs to the party which is
desirous of limiting that power to the clear and precise letter of the Constitution, and which
never puts a construction upon that act favorable to the government of the Union; far from
standing forth as the champion of centralization, General Jackson is the agent of the state
jealousies; and he was placed in his lofty station by the passions that are most opposed to the
central government. It is by perpetually flattering these passions that he maintains his station
and his popularity. General Jackson is the slave of the majority: he yields to its wishes, its
propensities, and its demands—say, rather, anticipates and forestalls them. ...General Jackson
stoops to gain the favor of the majority; but when he feels that his popularity is secure, he
overthrows all obstacles in the pursuit of the objects which the community approves or of
those which it does not regard with jealousy. Supported by a power that his predecessors never
had, he tramples on his personal enemies, whenever they cross his path, with a facility without
example; he takes upon himself the responsibility of measures that no one before him would
have ventured to attempt. He even treats the national representatives with a disdain
approaching to insult; he puts his veto on the laws of Congress and frequently neglects even to
reply to that powerful body. He is a favorite who sometimes treats his master roughly.

In the 20th century, Jackson was the subject of multiple highly
favorable biographies. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_M._Schlesinger_Jr."] Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.'s Age of Jackson
(1945) depicts Jackson as a man of the people battling inequality
and upper-class tyranny.[332] From the 1970s to the 1980s, Robert
Remini published a three-volume biography of Jackson followed
by an abridged one-volume study. Remini paints a generally
favorable portrait of Jackson.[333] He contends that Jacksonian
democracy "stretches the concept of democracy about as far as it
can go and still remain workable. ... As such it has inspired much
of the dynamic and dramatic events of the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries in American history—Populism, Progressivism, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal"] New
 and Fair Deals, and the programs of the New Frontier and Great
Society."[334] To Remini, Jackson serves as "the embodiment of
the new American ... This new man was no longer British. He no
longer wore the queue and silk pants. He wore trousers, and he had
stopped speaking with a British accent."[333] Other 20th-century
writers such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hofstadter"] Richard Hofstadter and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bray_Hammond"] Bray Hammond depict
Jackson as an advocate of the sort of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez-faire"] laissez-faire capitalism that
benefits the rich and oppresses the poor.[332]

Jackson's initiatives to deal with the conflicts between Native
American people and European-American settlers has been a source of controversy. Starting around 1970,
Jackson came under attack from some historians on this issue. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Zinn"] Howard Zinn called him "the most
aggressive enemy of the Indians in early American history" and "exterminator of Indians."[335][336]
Conversely, in 1969, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Paul_Prucha"] Francis Paul Prucha argued that Jackson's removal of the Five Civilized Tribes from
the extremely hostile white environment in the Old South to Oklahoma probably saved their very
existence.[337] While Remini regards the removal of Indians as a tragedy, he also maintains that if not for
Jackson's policies, the Southeastern tribes would have been annihilated, similar to the Yamasee, Mahican,
and Narragansett.[338][339][c] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_J._Birzer"] Bradley J. Birzer argues that Jackson was not a racist and that he thought of
Indians as inherently equal to whites, even if he also believed that Indian civilization "lagged behind". He
believed that the whites frequently mistreated the Indians and that the Indian removal served the interests of
both the Indians and the white settlers who would otherwise come into conflict with each other.[340]
Jackson has long been honored, along with Thomas Jefferson, in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson%E2%80%93Jackson_Day"] Jefferson–Jackson Day fundraising
dinners held by state Democratic Party organizations to honor the two men whom the party regards as its
founders. However, because both Jefferson and Jackson were slave owners, as well as because of Jackson's
Indian removal policies, many state party organizations have renamed the dinners.[341][342]
Brands argues that Jackson's reputation suffered since the 1960s as his actions towards Indians and African
Americans received new attention. After the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement"] civil rights movement, Brand writes, "his unrepentant
ownership of slaves marked him as one to be censured rather than praised." Further, "By the turn of the
present [21st] century, it was scarcely an exaggeration to say that the one thing American schoolchildren
learned about Jackson was that he was the author of the Trail of Tears." Brands notes that he was often
hailed during his lifetime as the "second George Washington" because, while Washington had fought for
independence, Jackson confirmed it at New Orleans and made the United States a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power"] great power. Over time,
while the Revolution has maintained a strong presence in the public conscience, memory of the War of
Page 33
1812, including the Battle of New Orleans, has sharply declined. Brands writes that this is because once
America had become a military power, "it was easy to think that America had been destined for this role
from the beginning."[343]
Still, Jackson's performance in office compared to other presidents has generally been ranked in the top half
in public opinion polling. His position in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-SPAN"] C-SPAN's poll dropped from 13th in 2009, to 18th in 2017, and
to 22nd in 2021.[344][345]
Portrayal on banknotes and stamps
Jackson [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_on_currency#Andrew_Jackson"] has appeared on U.S. banknotes as far back as 1869, and
extending into the 21st century. His image has appeared on the $5,
$10, $20, and $10,000 note. Most recently, his image has appeared
on the U.S. $20 Federal reserve note beginning in 1928.[346] In
2016, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury"] Treasury Secretary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Lew"] Jack Lew announced his goal that by
2020 an image of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Tubman"] Harriet Tubman would replace Jackson's
depiction on the front side of the $20 banknote, and that an image
of Jackson would be placed on the reverse side, though the final
decision will be made by his successors.[347] 
Jackson portrait on obverse $20 bill
Jackson has appeared on several postage stamps. He first appeared on an 1863 two-cent stamp, which is
commonly referred to by collectors as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Jack_(stamp)"] Black Jack due to the large [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_painting"] portraiture of Jackson on its face
printed in pitch black.[348] During the American Civil War, the Confederate government issued two
 Confederate postage stamps bearing Jackson's portrait, one a 2-cent red stamp and the other a 2-cent green
stamp, both issued in 1863.[349]
Memorials
Numerous counties and cities are named after him, including the cities of
Jacksonville in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida"] Florida and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_North_Carolina"] North Carolina; the cities of Jackson in
Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee; the city of
Andrew in Iowa; Jackson County in Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan,
Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Oregon; and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Parish,_Louisiana"] Jackson Parish in
Louisiana.[350]
Memorials to Jackson include a set of four identical [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrian_statue"] equestrian statues by
 the sculptor Clark Mills: in Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.; in Jackson
 Square, New Orleans; in Nashville on the grounds of the Tennessee State
Capitol; and in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida"] Jacksonville, Florida.[351] Other equestrian statues of
Jackson have been erected elsewhere, as in the State Capitol grounds in
 Raleigh, North Carolina. That statue controversially identifies him as one of  The tomb of Andrew and
the "presidents North Carolina gave the nation," and he is featured
alongside James Polk and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Johnson"] Andrew Johnson, both U.S. presidents born in
 North Carolina.[352] There is a bust of Andrew Jackson in Plaza Ferdinand 
 Rachel Jackson located at
The Hermitage
VII in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensacola,_Florida"] Pensacola, Florida, where he became the first governor of the
 Florida Territory in 1821.[353] There is also a 1928 bronze sculpture of Andrew Jackson by Belle Kinney
 Scholz and Leopold Scholz in the U.S. Capitol Building as part of the National Statuary Hall
Collection.[354]

Popular culture depictions
Jackson and his wife Rachel were the main subjects of a 1951 historical novel by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Stone"] Irving Stone, The
President's Lady, which told the story of their lives up until Rachel's death. The novel was the basis for the
 1953 film of the same name starring [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton_Heston"] Charlton Heston as Jackson and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Hayward"] Susan Hayward as Rachel.[355][356]
 Jackson has been a supporting character in a number of historical films and television productions. Lionel
Barrymore played Jackson in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gorgeous_Hussy"] The Gorgeous Hussy (1936), a fictionalized biography of Peggy Eaton
starring [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford"] Joan Crawford.[357] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buccaneer_(1938_film)"] The Buccaneer (1938), depicting the Battle of New Orleans, included Hugh
Sothern as Jackson,[358] and was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Buccaneer_(1958_film)"] remade in 1958 with Heston again playing Jackson.[359]Brian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Donlevy"] Donlevy

some episodes of the 1976 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS"] PBS [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries"] miniseries [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adams_Chronicles"] The Adams Chronicles.[361]
Jackson is the protagonist of the comedic historic rock musical [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Bloody_Andrew_Jackson"] Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson (2008) with
music and lyrics by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Friedman_(composer)"] Michael Friedman and book by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Timbers"] Alex Timbers.[362]
 In 1959, Jimmy Driftwood wrote the song "The Battle of New Orleans," which mentions Jackson. Johnny
Horton recorded it that same year.[363]

Notes
a. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] Vice President Calhoun resigned from office. As this was prior to the adoption of the Twenty-
fifth Amendment in 1967, a vacancy in the office of vice president was not filled until the next
ensuing election and inauguration.
b. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession"] Hugh Lawson White, President pro tempore of the Senate, was first in line in the United
States presidential line of succession between December 28, 1832, and March 4, 1833.[211]
c. Remini's footnote - Chapter 20, Footnote 61 (Page 574) - states: "Everyone knows what
happened to the Yemassees, Mohicans, and Narragansetts. They are gone, wiped out. ...
President Jackson and his Democratic friends warned the Cherokees and the other
southern tribes that extinction would be their fate if they refused to remove. ... Andrew
Jackson was right after all. But what a price to pay."[338]
