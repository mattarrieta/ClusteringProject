George Washington
George Washington (February 22, 1732[b]   –
December 14, 1799) was an American military officer,
statesman, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States"] Founding Father who served as the 1st
 president of the United States from 1789 to 1797.
Appointed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Congress"] Continental Congress as commander
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army"] Continental Army, Washington led the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)"] Patriot
forces to victory in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War"] American Revolutionary War
 and served as the president of the Constitutional
 Convention of 1787, which created the Constitution of
the United States and the American federal government.
Washington has been called the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_of_the_Nation"] Father of the Nation"
for his manifold leadership in the formative days of the
country.[10] 
George Washington
Washington's first public office was serving as the
official [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"] surveyor of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culpeper_County,_Virginia"] Culpeper County, Virginia from
1749 to 1750. Subsequently, he received his initial
military training (as well as a command with the
 Virginia Regiment) during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War"] French and Indian War.
He was later elected to the Virginia [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Burgesses"] House of Burgesses
and was named a delegate to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Congress"] Continental Congress.
Here he was appointed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_General_of_the_United_States_Army"] Commanding General of the
 Continental Army. With this title, he commanded
American forces (allied with France) in the defeat and
surrender of the British at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown"] Siege of Yorktown during
 the American Revolutionary War. He resigned his
commission after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)"] Treaty of Paris was signed in
1783.
Washington played an indispensable role in adopting
and ratifying the Constitution of the United States. He
 was then twice elected president by the Electoral
College unanimously. As president, he implemented a
strong, well-financed national government while
remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry between cabinet
members [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"] Thomas Jefferson and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton.
 During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy
of neutrality while sanctioning the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Treaty"] Jay Treaty. He set
enduring precedents for the office of president,
including the title "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(government_title)#In_the_United_States"] Mr. President",  and swearing the
 Oath of Office on the Bible. His [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington%27s_Farewell_Address"] Farewell Address is
widely regarded as a  pre-eminent statement on
republicanism.

 Washington was a slave owner who had a complicated
relationship with slavery. During his lifetime he
controlled a cumulative total of over 577 slaves, who
were forced to work on his farms and wherever he
lived, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_House_(Philadelphia)"] President's House in Philadelphia.
As president, he signed laws passed by Congress that
both protected and curtailed slavery. His will said that
one of his slaves, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lee_(valet)"] William Lee, should be freed upon his
death and that the other 123 slaves must work for his
wife and be freed on her death. She freed them during
her lifetime to remove the incentive for hastening her
death.[11][12]
He endeavored to assimilate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States"] Native Americans into the
 Anglo-American culture. However, he waged military
campaigns against hostile Native American nations
 during the Revolutionary War and the Northwest Indian
War. He was a member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglicanism"] Anglican Church and the
Freemasons, and he urged broad religious freedom in
his roles as general and president. Upon his death, he
was eulogized by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Lee_III"] Henry "Light-Horse Harry" Lee as
"first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his
countrymen".[13]
Washington has been [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_memorials_to_George_Washington"] memorialized by monuments, a
 federal holiday, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_depictions_of_George_Washington"] various media depictions, geographical
 locations, including the national capital, the State of
Washington, stamps, and currency, and many scholars
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States"] and ordinary Americans alike rank him among the
greatest U.S. presidents. In 1976 Washington was
 posthumously promoted to the rank of General of the
Armies of the United States, the highest rank in the
United States Army.

Early life (1732–1752) 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_family"] Washington family was a wealthy Virginia [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planter_class"] planter family that
 had made its fortune through land speculation and the cultivation of
tobacco.[14] Washington's  great-grandfather [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Washington"] John Washington
 emigrated in 1656[15] from Sulgrave, Northamptonshire, England,
to the English [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Virginia"] colony of Virginia where he accumulated 5,000
acres (2,000 ha) of land, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Hunting_Creek"] Little Hunting Creek on the
 Potomac River.[16] George Washington was born on February 22,
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry_Farm"] Ferry Farm, the residence of the
Washington family on the
Rappahannock River 
1732,[b] at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Birthplace_National_Monument"] Popes Creek in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westmoreland_County,_Virginia"] Westmoreland County, in the British
colony of Virginia,[17] and was the first of six children of
 Augustine and Mary Ball Washington.[18] His father was a justice
of the peace and a prominent public figure who had four additional
children from his first marriage to Jane Butler.[19] The family
moved to Little Hunting Creek in 1735. In 1738, they moved to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry_Farm"] Ferry Farm near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredericksburg,_Virginia"] Fredericksburg, Virginia
on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rappahannock_River"] Rappahannock River. When Augustine died in 1743, Washington inherited Ferry Farm and ten
slaves; his older half-brother [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Washington_(1718%E2%80%931752)"] Lawrence inherited Little Hunting Creek and renamed it [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Vernon"] Mount Vernon.
Washington did not have the formal education his elder brothers received at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appleby_Grammar_School"] Appleby Grammar School in
England, but did attend the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Church"] Lower Church School in Hartfield. He learned mathematics, trigonometry, and
land [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveying"] surveying and became a talented draftsman and map-maker. By early adulthood, he was writing with
"considerable force" and "precision";[20] however, his writing displayed little wit or humor. In pursuit of
admiration, status, and power, he tended to attribute his shortcomings and failures to someone else's
ineffectuality.[21]
Washington often visited Mount Vernon and Belvoir, the plantation that belonged to Lawrence's father-in-
law [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fairfax"] William Fairfax. Fairfax became Washington's patron and surrogate father, and Washington spent a
month in 1748 with a team surveying Fairfax's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenandoah_Valley"] Shenandoah Valley property.[22] The following year he
received a surveyor's license from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_William_%26_Mary"] College of William & Mary when he was 17 years old.[c] Even
though Washington had not served the customary apprenticeship, Fairfax appointed him surveyor of
 Culpeper County, Virginia, and he appeared in Culpeper County to take his oath of office July 20,
1749.[23] He subsequently familiarized himself with the frontier region, and though he resigned from the
job in 1750, he continued to do surveys west of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Mountains"] Blue Ridge Mountains.[24] By 1752 he had bought
almost 1,500 acres (600 ha) in the Valley and owned 2,315 acres (937 ha).[25]
In 1751, Washington made his only trip abroad when he accompanied Lawrence to Barbados, hoping the
climate would cure his brother's tuberculosis.[26] Washington contracted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox"] smallpox during that trip, which
immunized him and left his face slightly scarred.[27] Lawrence died in 1752, and Washington leased Mount
Vernon from his widow Anne; he inherited it outright after her death in 1761.[28]
Colonial military career (1752–1758)
Lawrence Washington's service as adjutant general of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_militia"] Virginia militia inspired his half-brother George
to seek a commission. Virginia's lieutenant governor, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Dinwiddie"] Robert Dinwiddie, appointed George Washington as a
major and commander of one of the four militia districts. The British and French were competing for
control of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_River"] Ohio Valley. While the British were constructing forts along the Ohio River, the French were
doing the same—constructing forts between the Ohio River and Lake Erie.[29]
Page 5
In October 1753, Dinwiddie appointed Washington as a special envoy. He had sent George to demand
French forces to vacate land that was being claimed by the British.[d] Washington was also appointed to
make peace with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroquois_Confederacy"] Iroquois Confederacy, and to gather further intelligence about the French forces.[31]
Washington met with Half-King Tanacharison, and other Iroquois chiefs, at Logstown, and gathered
information about the numbers and locations of the French forts, as well as intelligence concerning
 individuals taken prisoner by the French. Washington was given the nickname Conotocaurius (town
destroyer or devourer of villages) by Tanacharison. The nickname had previously been given to his great-
grandfather [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Washington"] John Washington in the late seventeenth century by the Susquehannock.[32][33]
Washington's party reached the Ohio River in November 1753, and were intercepted by a French patrol.
The party was escorted to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Le_Boeuf"] Fort Le Boeuf, where Washington was received in a friendly manner. He
delivered the British demand to vacate to the French commander [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Legardeur_de_Saint-Pierre"] Saint-Pierre, but the French refused to
leave. Saint-Pierre gave Washington his official answer in a sealed envelope after a few days' delay, as well
as food and extra winter clothing for his party's journey back to Virginia.[34] Washington completed the
precarious mission in 77 days, in difficult winter conditions, achieving a measure of distinction when his
report was published in Virginia and in London.[35]
French and Indian War
In February 1754, Dinwiddie promoted Washington to lieutenant colonel and second-in-command of the
300-strong Virginia Regiment, with orders to confront French forces at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_State_Park"] Forks of the Ohio.[36]
Washington set out for the Forks with half the regiment in April and soon learned a French force of 1,000
had begun construction of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Duquesne"] Fort Duquesne there. In May, having set up a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Necessity_National_Battlefield"] defensive position at Great
Meadows, he learned that the French had made camp seven miles (11 km) away; he decided to take the
offensive.[37] 
The French detachment proved to be only about fifty men, so
Washington advanced on May 28 with a small force of
Virginians and Indian allies to ambush them.[38][e] What took
place, known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jumonville_Glen"] Battle of Jumonville Glen or the
"Jumonville affair", was disputed, and French forces were killed
 outright with muskets and hatchets. French commander Joseph
Coulon de Jumonville, who carried a diplomatic message for the
Lieutenant Colonel Washington holds
night council at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Necessity"] Fort Necessity 
British to evacuate, was killed. French forces found Jumonville
and some of his men dead and scalped and assumed Washington
was responsible.[40] Washington blamed his translator for not
communicating the French intentions.[41] Dinwiddie
congratulated Washington for his victory over the French.[42]
 This incident ignited the French and Indian War, which later became part of the larger Seven Years'
War.[43]
The full Virginia Regiment joined Washington at Fort Necessity the following month with news that he had
been promoted to command of the regiment and colonel upon the regimental commander's death. The
 regiment was reinforced by an independent company of a hundred South Carolinians led by Captain James
Mackay, whose royal commission outranked that of Washington, and a conflict of command ensued. On
July 3, a French force attacked with 900 men, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Necessity"] ensuing battle ended in Washington's surrender.[44]
In the aftermath, Colonel [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Innes_(North_Carolina)"] James Innes took command of intercolonial forces, the Virginia Regiment was
divided, and Washington was offered a captaincy which he refused, with the resignation of his
commission.[45]
Page 6
In 1755, Washington served voluntarily as an aide to General
 Edward Braddock, who led a British [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braddock_Expedition"] expedition to expel the
French from Fort Duquesne and the Ohio Country.[46] On
Washington's recommendation, Braddock split the army into one
main column and a lightly equipped "flying column".[47] Suffering
from a severe case of dysentery, Washington was left behind, and
when he rejoined Braddock at Monongahela the French and their
Indian allies [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Monongahela"] ambushed the divided army. Two-thirds of the British
Washington the Soldier: Lieutenant
Colonel Washington on horseback
during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Monongahela"] Battle of the Monongahela
(oil, Reǵnier, 1834) 
force became casualties, including the mortally wounded
Braddock. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas
Gage, Washington, still very ill, rallied the survivors and formed a
rear guard, allowing the remnants of the force to disengage and
retreat.[48] During the engagement, he had two horses shot from
under him, and his hat and coat were bullet-pierced.[49] His
conduct under fire redeemed his reputation among critics of his command in the Battle of Fort
Necessity,[50] but he was not included by the succeeding commander (Colonel Thomas Dunbar) in
planning subsequent operations.[51]
The Virginia Regiment was reconstituted in August 1755, and Dinwiddie appointed Washington its
commander, again with the rank of colonel. Washington clashed over seniority almost immediately, this
time with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dagworthy"] John Dagworthy, another captain of superior royal rank, who commanded a detachment of
Marylanders at the regiment's headquarters in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Cumberland_(Maryland)"] Fort Cumberland.[52] Washington, impatient for an offensive
against Fort Duquesne, was convinced Braddock would have granted him a royal commission and pressed
his case in February 1756 with Braddock's successor, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shirley"] William Shirley, and again in January 1757 with
Shirley's successor, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Campbell,_4th_Earl_of_Loudoun"] Lord Loudoun. Shirley ruled in Washington's favor only in the matter of Dagworthy;
Loudoun humiliated Washington, refused him a royal commission and agreed only to relieve him of the
responsibility of manning Fort Cumberland.[53]
In 1758, the Virginia Regiment was assigned to the British [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes_Expedition"] Forbes Expedition to capture Fort
Duquesne.[54][f] Washington disagreed with General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_(British_Army_officer)"] John Forbes' tactics and chosen route.[56] Forbes
nevertheless made Washington a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brevet_(military)"] brevet brigadier general and gave him command of one of the three
brigades that would assault the fort. The French abandoned the fort and the valley before the assault was
launched; Washington saw only a friendly fire incident which left 14 dead and 26 injured. The war lasted
another four years, and Washington resigned his commission and returned to Mount Vernon.[57]
Under Washington, the Virginia Regiment had defended 300 miles (480 km) of frontier against twenty
Indian attacks in ten months.[58] He increased the professionalism of the regiment as it increased from 300
to 1,000 men, and Virginia's frontier population suffered less than other colonies. Some historians have said
this was Washington's "only unqualified success" during the war.[59] Though he failed to realize a royal
commission, he did gain self-confidence, leadership skills, and invaluable knowledge of British military
tactics. The destructive competition Washington witnessed among colonial politicians fostered his later
support of a strong central government.[60]
Marriage, civilian, and political life (1755–1775)
On January 6, 1759, Washington, at age 26, married [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Washington"] Martha Dandridge Custis, the 27-year-old widow of
wealthy plantation owner [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Parke_Custis"] Daniel Parke Custis. The marriage took place at Martha's estate; she was
intelligent, gracious, and experienced in managing a planter's estate, and the couple created a happy
marriage.[61] They raised [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Parke_Custis"] John Parke Custis (Jacky) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_%22Patsy%22_Parke_Custis"] Martha "Patsy" Parke Custis, children from her
 previous marriage, and later Jacky's children Eleanor Parke Custis (Nelly) and George Washington Parke
Custis (Washy). Washington's 1751 bout with smallpox is thought to have rendered him sterile, though it is
Page 7
equally likely that "Martha may have sustained injury during the birth of
Patsy, her final child, making additional births impossible."[62] The
couple lamented not having any children together.[63][g] They moved to
Mount Vernon, near Alexandria, where he took up life as a planter of
tobacco and wheat and emerged as a political figure.[66]
The marriage gave Washington control over Martha's one-third [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dower"] dower
interest in the 18,000-acre (7,300 ha) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Parke_Custis#Estate"] Custis estate, and he managed the
remaining two-thirds for Martha's children; the estate also included 84
slaves. He became one of Virginia's wealthiest men, which increased his
social standing.[67]
At Washington's urging, Governor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norborne_Berkeley,_4th_Baron_Botetourt"] Lord Botetourt fulfilled Dinwiddie's
1754 promise of land bounties to all-volunteer militia during the French
and Indian War.[68] In late 1770, Washington inspected the lands in the
 Ohio and Great Kanawha regions, and he engaged surveyor William 
Colonel George Washington,
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Willson_Peale"] Charles Willson Peale,
1772
Crawford to subdivide it. Crawford allotted 23,200 acres (9,400 ha) to
Washington; Washington told the veterans that their land was hilly and unsuitable for farming, and he
agreed to purchase 20,147 acres (8,153 ha), leaving some feeling they had been duped.[69] He also doubled
the size of Mount Vernon to 6,500 acres (2,600 ha) and increased its slave population to more than a
hundred by 1775.[70]
Washington's political activities included supporting the candidacy of his friend [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_William_Fairfax"] George William Fairfax in
his 1755 bid to represent the region in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_House_of_Burgesses"] Virginia House of Burgesses. This support led to a dispute which
resulted in a physical altercation between Washington and another Virginia planter, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Payne_(sheriff)"] William Payne.
Washington defused the situation, including ordering officers from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Regiment"] Virginia Regiment to stand down.
Washington apologized to Payne the following day at a tavern. Payne had been expecting to be challenged
to a duel.[71][72][73]
As a respected military hero and large landowner, Washington held local offices and was elected to the
Virginia provincial legislature, representing Frederick County in the House of Burgesses for seven years
beginning in 1758.[70] He plied the voters with beer, brandy, and other beverages, although he was absent
while serving on the Forbes Expedition.[74] He won the election with roughly 40 percent of the vote,
defeating three other candidates with the help of several local supporters. He rarely spoke in his early
legislative career, but he became a prominent critic of Britain's taxation policy and mercantilist policies
towards the American colonies starting in the 1760s.[75]
By occupation, Washington was a planter, and he imported luxuries and other goods from England, paying
for them by exporting tobacco.[76] His profligate spending combined with low tobacco prices left him
£1,800 in debt by 1764, prompting him to diversify his holdings.[77] In 1765, because of erosion and other
soil problems, he changed Mount Vernon's primary cash crop from tobacco to wheat and expanded
operations to include corn [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington%27s_Gristmill"] flour milling and fishing.[78] Washington also took time for leisure with fox
hunting, fishing, dances, theater, cards, backgammon, and billiards.[79]
Washington soon was counted among the political and social elite in Virginia. From 1768 to 1775, he
invited some 2,000 guests to his Mount Vernon estate, mostly those whom he considered people of rank,
and was known to be exceptionally cordial toward his guests.[80] He became more politically active in
1769, presenting legislation in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_General_Assembly"] Virginia Assembly to establish an embargo on goods from Great
Britain.[81]

Washington's step-daughter Patsy Custis suffered from epileptic attacks
from age 12, and she died in his arms in 1773. The following day, he wrote
to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burwell_Bassett"] Burwell Bassett: "It is easier to conceive, than to describe, the distress of
this Family".[82] He canceled all business activity and remained with
Martha every night for three months.[83]
Opposition to British Parliament and Crown
 Washington played a central role before and during the American
Revolution. His disdain for the British military had begun when he was
passed over for promotion into the Regular Army. Opposed to taxes
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_representation"] imposed by the British Parliament on the Colonies without proper
 representation,[84] he and other colonists were also angered by the Royal
Proclamation of 1763 which banned American settlement west of the
 Allegheny Mountains and protected the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_fur_trade"] British fur trade.[85] 
Martha Washington based
 on a 1757 portrait by John
Wollaston
Washington believed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_Act_1765"] Stamp Act of 1765 was an "Act of Oppression",
and he celebrated its repeal the following year.[h] In March 1766, Parliament passed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaratory_Act"] Declaratory Act
asserting that Parliamentary law superseded colonial law.[87] In the late 1760s, the interference of the
British Crown in American lucrative western land speculation spurred on the American Revolution.[88]
Washington himself was a prosperous land speculator, and in 1767, he encouraged "adventures" to acquire
backcountry western lands.[88] Washington helped lead widespread protests against the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townshend_Acts"] Townshend Acts
passed by Parliament in 1767, and he introduced a proposal in May 1769 drafted by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason"] George Mason which
called Virginians to boycott British goods; the Acts were mostly repealed in 1770.[89]
Parliament sought to punish Massachusetts colonists for their role in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party"] Boston Tea Party in 1774 by
passing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intolerable_Acts"] Coercive Acts, which Washington referred to as "an invasion of our rights and privileges".[90]
He said Americans must not submit to acts of tyranny since "custom and use shall make us as tame and
abject slaves, as the blacks we rule over with such arbitrary sway".[91] That July, he and George Mason
drafted a list of resolutions for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_County,_Virginia"] Fairfax County committee which Washington chaired, and the committee
adopted the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfax_Resolves"] Fairfax Resolves calling for a Continental Congress, and an end to the slave trade.[92] On
August 1, Washington attended the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Conventions"] First Virginia Convention, where he was selected as a delegate to the
 First Continental Congress, September 5 to October 26, 1774, which he also attended.[93] As tensions rose
 in 1774, he helped train county militias in Virginia and organized enforcement of the Continental
Association boycott of British goods instituted by the Congress.[94]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War"] American Revolutionary War began on April 19, 1775, with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord"] Battles of Lexington and Concord
and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Boston"] Siege of Boston.[95] The colonists were divided over breaking away from British rule and split into
two factions: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)"] Patriots who rejected British rule, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalist_(American_Revolution)"] Loyalists who desired to remain subject to the King.[96]
General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Gage"] Thomas Gage was commander of British forces in America at the beginning of the war.[97] Upon
hearing the shocking news of the onset of war, Washington was "sobered and dismayed",[98] and he hastily
departed Mount Vernon on May 4, 1775, to join the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress"] Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia.[99]
Commander in chief (1775–1783)
 Congress created the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army"] Continental Army on June 14, 1775, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Adams"] Samuel and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams"] John Adams nominated
Washington to become its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief"] commander-in-chief. Washington was chosen over [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hancock"] John Hancock because of his
military experience and the belief that a Virginian would better unite the colonies. He was considered an
incisive leader who kept his "ambition in check".[100] He was unanimously elected commander in chief by
Congress the next day.[101]
Page 9
Washington appeared before Congress in uniform and gave an acceptance
speech on June 16, declining a salary—though he was later reimbursed
expenses. He was commissioned on June 19 and was roundly praised by
Congressional delegates, including John Adams, who proclaimed that he
was the man best suited to lead and unite the colonies.[102][103] Congress
appointed Washington "General & Commander in chief of the army of the
 United Colonies and of all the forces raised or to be raised by them", and
instructed him to take charge of the siege of Boston on June 22, 1775.[104]
 Congress chose his primary staff officers, including Major General Artemas
Ward, Adjutant General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Gates"] Horatio Gates, Major General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lee_(general)"] Charles Lee, Major
 General Philip Schuyler, Major General Nathanael Greene, Colonel Henry
Knox, and Colonel [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton.[105] Washington was impressed
by Colonel [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Arnold"] Benedict Arnold and gave him responsibility for launching an
invasion of Canada. He also engaged French and Indian War compatriot
Brigadier General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Morgan"] Daniel Morgan. Henry Knox impressed Adams with
ordnance knowledge, and Washington promoted him to colonel and chief
of artillery.[106] 
General Washington,
Commander of the
 Continental Army by Charles
Willson Peale (1776)
At the start of the war, Washington opposed the recruiting of blacks, both free and enslaved, into the
Continental Army. After his appointment, Washington banned their enlistment. The British saw an
opportunity to divide the colonies, and the colonial governor of Virginia issued [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunmore%27s_Proclamation"] a proclamation, which
promised freedom to slaves if they joined the British.[107] Desperate for manpower by late 1777,
Washington relented and overturned his ban.[108] By the end of the war, around one-tenth of Washington's
army were blacks.[109] Following the British surrender, Washington sought to enforce terms of the
preliminary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)"] Treaty of Paris (1783) by reclaiming slaves freed by the British and returning them to servitude.
He arranged to make this request to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Carleton,_1st_Baron_Dorchester"] Sir Guy Carleton on May 6, 1783. Instead, Carleton issued 3,000
freedom certificates and all former slaves in New York City were able to leave before the city was
evacuated by the British in late November 1783.[110]
After the war Washington became the target of accusations made by General Lee involving his alleged
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Goddard_(publisher)"] questionable conduct as Commander in Chief during the war that were published by patriot-printer William
Goddard. Goddard in a letter of May 30, 1785, had informed Washington of Lee's request to publish his
account and assured him that he "...took the liberty to suppress such expressions as appeared to be the
ebullitions of a disappointed & irritated mind ...". Washington replied, telling Goddard to print what he saw
fit, and to let "... the impartial & dispassionate world," draw their own conclusions.[111][112]
Siege of Boston 
Early in 1775, in response to the growing rebellious movement,
London sent British troops, commanded by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Gage"] General Thomas Gage,
to occupy Boston. They set up fortifications about the city, making
it impervious to attack. Various local militias surrounded the city
and effectively trapped the British, resulting in a standoff.[113]
Washington taking command of the
Continental Army, just before the
siege. 
As Washington headed for Boston, word of his march preceded
him, and he was greeted everywhere; gradually, he became a
symbol of the Patriot cause.[114][i] Upon arrival on July 2, 1775,
two weeks after the Patriot defeat at nearby [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bunker_Hill"] Bunker Hill, he set up
his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts"] Cambridge, Massachusetts headquarters and inspected the new
army there, only to find an undisciplined and badly outfitted militia.[115] After consultation, he initiated
Page 10
 Benjamin Franklin's suggested reforms—drilling the soldiers and imposing strict discipline, floggings, and
incarceration.[116] Washington ordered his officers to identify the skills of recruits to ensure military
effectiveness, while removing incompetent officers.[117] He petitioned Gage, his former superior, to release
captured Patriot officers from prison and treat them humanely.[118] In October 1775, King [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III"] George III
declared that the colonies were in open rebellion and relieved General Gage of command for incompetence,
replacing him with General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Howe,_5th_Viscount_Howe"] William Howe.[119]
The Continental Army, further diminished by expiring short-term enlistments, and by January 1776 reduced
by half to 9,600 men, had to be supplemented with the militia, and was joined by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_train_of_artillery"] Knox with heavy artillery
captured from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Fort_Ticonderoga"] Fort Ticonderoga.[120] When the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_River"] Charles River froze over, Washington was eager to cross
and storm Boston, but General Gates and others were opposed to untrained militia striking well-garrisoned
fortifications. Washington reluctantly agreed to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification_of_Dorchester_Heights"] secure the Dorchester Heights, 100 feet above Boston, in an
attempt to force the British out of the city.[121] On March 9, under cover of darkness, Washington's troops
brought up Knox's big guns and bombarded British ships in Boston harbor. On [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evacuation_Day_(Massachusetts)"] March 17, 9,000 British
troops and Loyalists began a chaotic ten-day evacuation of Boston aboard 120 ships. Soon after,
Washington entered the city with 500 men, with explicit orders not to plunder the city. He ordered
 variolation against smallpox to great effect, as he did later in Morristown, New Jersey.[122] He refrained
from exerting military authority in Boston, leaving civilian matters in the hands of local authorities.[123][j]
Invasion of Quebec (1775)
The Invasion of Quebec (June 1775 – October 1776, French: Invasion du Québec) was the first major
military initiative by the newly formed Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. On June
27, 1775, Congress authorized General Philip Schuyler to investigate, and, if it seemed appropriate, begin
an invasion. Benedict Arnold, passed over for its command, went to Boston and convinced General
George Washington to send a supporting force to Quebec City under his command. The objective of the
campaign was to seize the Province of Quebec (part of modern-day Canada) from Great Britain, and
persuade French-speaking Canadiens to join the revolution on the side of the Thirteen Colonies. One
expedition left Fort Ticonderoga under Richard Montgomery, besieged and captured Fort St. Johns, and
very nearly captured British General Guy Carleton when taking Montreal. The other expedition, under
Benedict Arnold, left Cambridge, Massachusetts and traveled with great difficulty through the wilderness
of Maine to Quebec City. The two forces joined there, but they were defeated at the Battle of Quebec in
December 1775.
Battle of Long Island
Washington then proceeded to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City"] New York City, arriving on April
13, 1776, and began constructing fortifications to thwart the
expected British attack. He ordered his occupying forces to treat
civilians and their property with respect, to avoid the abuses which
Bostonian citizens suffered at the hands of British troops during
their occupation.[125] A plot to assassinate or capture him was
discovered and thwarted, resulting in the arrest of 98 people
 involved or complicit (56 of which were from Long Island (Kings
(Brooklyn) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens"] Queens counties), including the Loyalist Mayor of
 New York David Mathews.[126] Washington's bodyguard, Thomas
Hickey, was hanged for mutiny and sedition.[127] General Howe 
Battle of Long Island
 Alonzo Chappel (1858)
transported his resupplied army, with the British fleet, from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halifax,_Nova_Scotia"] Halifax
to New York, knowing the city was key to securing the continent. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Germain,_1st_Viscount_Sackville"] George Germain, who ran the British
war effort in England, believed it could be won with one "decisive blow".[128] The British forces,
Page 11
including more than a hundred ships and thousands of troops, began arriving on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island"] Staten Island on July 2 to
lay siege to the city.[129] After the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence"] Declaration of Independence was adopted on July 4, Washington
informed his troops in his general orders of July 9 that Congress had declared the united colonies to be
"free and independent states".[130]
Howe's troop strength totaled 32,000 regulars and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_(soldier)"] Hessians auxiliaries, and Washington's consisted of
 23,000, mostly raw recruits and militia.[131] In August, Howe landed 20,000 troops at Gravesend,
Brooklyn, and approached Washington's fortifications, as George III proclaimed the rebellious American
colonists to be traitors.[132] Washington, opposing his generals, chose to fight, based upon inaccurate
information that Howe's army had only 8,000-plus troops.[133] In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Island"] Battle of Long Island, Howe
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_and_New_Jersey_campaign"] assaulted Washington's flank and inflicted 1,500 Patriot casualties, the British suffering 400.[134]
Washington retreated, instructing General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Heath"] William Heath to acquisition river craft in the area. On August
30, General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Alexander,_Lord_Stirling"] William Alexander held off the British and gave cover while the army crossed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_River"] East River
under darkness to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan"] Manhattan Island without loss of life or materiel, although Alexander was captured.[135]
Howe, emboldened by his Long Island victory, dispatched Washington as "George Washington, Esq." in
futility to negotiate peace. Washington declined, demanding to be addressed with diplomatic protocol, as
 general and fellow belligerent, not as a "rebel", lest his men are hanged as such if captured.[136] The Royal
Navy bombarded the unstable earthworks on lower Manhattan Island.[137] Washington, with misgivings,
heeded the advice of Generals Greene and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Putnam"] Putnam to defend [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Washington_(Manhattan)"] Fort Washington. They were unable to hold it,
 and Washington abandoned it despite General Lee's objections, as his army retired north to the White
Plains.[138] Howe's pursuit forced Washington to retreat across the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River"] Hudson River to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lee_Historic_Park"] Fort Lee to avoid
encirclement. Howe landed his troops on Manhattan in November and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fort_Washington"] captured Fort Washington, inflicting
high casualties on the Americans. Washington was responsible for delaying the retreat, though he blamed
Congress and General Greene. Loyalists in New York considered Howe a liberator and spread a rumor that
Washington had set fire to the city.[139] Patriot morale reached its lowest when Lee was captured.[140] Now
reduced to 5,400 troops, Washington's army retreated through [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_New_Jersey"] New Jersey, and Howe broke off pursuit,
delaying his advance on Philadelphia, and set up winter quarters in New York.[141]
Crossing the Delaware, Trenton, and Princeton
Washington crossed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_River"] Delaware River into Pennsylvania, where
Lee's replacement [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sullivan_(general)"] John Sullivan joined him with 2,000 more
troops.[143] The future of the Continental Army was in doubt for
lack of supplies, a harsh winter, expiring enlistments, and
desertions. Washington was disappointed that many New Jersey
residents were Loyalists or skeptical about the prospect of
independence.[144]
Howe split up his British Army and posted a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_(soldier)"] Hessian garrison at
 Trenton to hold western New Jersey and the east shore of the 
 Washington Crossing the Delaware,
 Emanuel Leutze (1851)[k]
Delaware,[145] but the army appeared complacent, and Washington
and his generals devised a surprise attack on the Hessians at Trenton, which he codenamed "Victory or
Death".[146] The army was to cross the Delaware River to Trenton in three divisions: one led by
 Washington (2,400 troops),  another by General James Ewing (700),  and the third by Colonel John
Cadwalader (1,500). The force was to then split, with Washington taking the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennington,_New_Jersey"] Pennington Road and General
Sullivan traveling south on the river's edge.[147]
Washington first ordered a 60-mile search for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_boat"] Durham boats to transport his army, and he ordered the
destruction of vessels that could be used by the British.[148] Washington [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington%27s_crossing_of_the_Delaware_River"] crossed the Delaware River on
 Christmas night,[149] December 25, 1776, while he personally risked capture staking out the Jersey
Page 12
shoreline. His men followed across the ice-obstructed river in sleet
and snow from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McConkey%27s_Ferry"] McConkey's Ferry, with 40 men per vessel. The
wind churned up the waters, and they were pelted with hail, but by
3:00 a.m. on December 26, they made it across with no losses.[150]
Henry Knox was delayed, managing frightened horses and about
18 field guns on flat-bottomed ferries. Cadwalader and Ewing
failed to cross due to the ice and heavy currents, and awaiting
Washington doubted his planned attack on Trenton. Once Knox
arrived, Washington proceeded to Trenton to take only his troops
against the Hessians, rather than risk being spotted returning his
army to Pennsylvania.[151] 
 The Passage of the Delaware, by
 Thomas Sully, 1819 (Museum of
Fine Arts, Boston)
The troops spotted Hessian positions a mile from Trenton, so
Washington split his force into two columns, rallying his men:
"Soldiers keep by your officers. For God's sake, keep by your officers." The two columns were separated
at the Birmingham crossroads. General Nathanael Greene's column took the upper Ferry Road, led by
Washington, and General John Sullivan's column advanced on River Road. ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Battle_of_Trenton.Dean.USMA.edu.history.gif"] See map.)[152] The Americans
marched in sleet and snowfall. Many were shoeless with bloodied feet, and two died of exposure.
Meanwhile, Hessian Commander [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Rall"] Johann Rall was held up at the home of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Hunt"] Abraham Hunt, of Trenton, who
had placated Rall and some of his officers with plenty of food and drink into the late hours of the evening
and morning. At sunrise, Washington, aided by Major General Knox and artillery, led his men in a surprise
attack on an unsuspecting Rall. The Hessians had 22 killed, including Colonel Rall, 83 wounded, and 850
captured with supplies.[153]
Washington retreated across the Delaware River to Pennsylvania
 and returned to New Jersey on January 3, 1777, launching an
attack on British regulars at Princeton, with 40 Americans killed or
wounded and 273 British killed or captured.[154] American
Generals [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Mercer"] Hugh Mercer and John Cadwalader were being driven
back by the British when Mercer was mortally wounded, then
Washington arrived and led the men in a counterattack which
advanced to within 30 yards (27 m) of the British line.[155]
Some British troops retreated after a brief stand, while others took
refuge in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassau_Hall"] Nassau Hall, which became the target of Colonel
 Alexander Hamilton's cannons. Washington's troops charged, the

by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Trumbull"] John Trumbull
British surrendered in less than an hour, and 194 soldiers laid down
their arms.[156] Howe retreated to New York City where his army remained inactive until early the next
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morristown,_New_Jersey"] year.[157] Washington's depleted Continental Army took up winter headquarters in Morristown, New
Jersey while disrupting British supply lines and expelling them from parts of New Jersey. Washington later
said the British could have successfully counterattacked his encampment before his troops were dug in.[158]
The victories at Trenton and Princeton by Washington revived Patriot morale and changed the course of the
war. [149]
The British still controlled New York, and many Patriot soldiers did not re-enlist or deserted after the harsh
winter campaign. Congress instituted greater rewards for re-enlisting and punishments for desertion to
effect greater troop numbers.[159] Strategically, Washington's victories were pivotal for the Revolution and
quashed the British strategy of showing overwhelming force followed by offering generous terms.[160] In
February 1777, word reached London of the American victories at Trenton and Princeton, and the British
realized the Patriots were in a position to demand unconditional independence.[161]

Brandywine, Germantown, and Saratoga
 In July 1777, British General John Burgoyne led the Saratoga campaign south from Quebec through Lake
Champlain and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Fort_Ticonderoga_(1777)"] recaptured Fort Ticonderoga intending to divide [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England"] New England, including control of the
 Hudson River. However, General Howe in British-occupied New York blundered, taking his army south to
Philadelphia rather than up the Hudson River to join Burgoyne near Albany.[162] Meanwhile, Washington
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_du_Motier,_Marquis_de_Lafayette"] Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette rushed to Philadelphia to engage Howe and were shocked to
learn of Burgoyne's progress in upstate New York, where the Patriots were led by General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Schuyler"] Philip Schuyler
 and successor Horatio Gates. Washington's army of less experienced men were defeated in the pitched
battles at Philadelphia.[163]
Howe outmaneuvered Washington at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Brandywine"] Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, and marched
unopposed into the nation's capital at Philadelphia. A Patriot [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Germantown"] attack failed against the British at
 Germantown in October. Major General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Conway"] Thomas Conway prompted some members of Congress (referred
to as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_Cabal"] Conway Cabal) to consider removing Washington from command because of the losses incurred
at Philadelphia. Washington's supporters resisted, and the matter was finally dropped after much
deliberation.[164] Once the plot was exposed, Conway wrote an apology to Washington, resigned, and
returned to France.[165]
Washington was concerned with Howe's movements during the Saratoga campaign to the north, and he
was also aware that Burgoyne was moving south toward Saratoga from Quebec. Washington took some
risks to support Gates' army, sending reinforcements north with Generals [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Arnold"] Benedict Arnold, his most
 aggressive field commander, and Benjamin Lincoln. On October 7, 1777, Burgoyne tried to take Bemis
Heights but was isolated from support by Howe. He was forced to retreat to Saratoga and ultimately
surrendered after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Saratoga"] Battles of Saratoga. As Washington suspected, Gates' victory emboldened his
critics.[166] Biographer John Alden maintains, "It was inevitable that the defeats of Washington's forces and
the concurrent victory of the forces in upper New York should be compared." The admiration for
Washington was waning, including little credit from John Adams.[167] British commander Howe resigned
in May 1778, left America forever, and was replaced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clinton_(British_Army_officer,_born_1730)"] Sir Henry Clinton.[168]
Valley Forge and Monmouth
 Washington's army of 11,000 went into winter quarters at Valley
Forge north of Philadelphia in December 1777. They suffered
between 2,000 and 3,000 deaths in the extreme cold over six
months, mostly from disease and lack of food, clothing, and
shelter.[169] Meanwhile, the British were comfortably quartered in
Philadelphia, paying for supplies in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling"] pounds sterling, while
Washington struggled with a devalued [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_American_currency"] American paper currency.
Washington and Lafayette at Valley 
The woodlands were soon exhausted of game, and by February,
lowered morale and increased desertions ensued.[170]
Forge, by John Ward Dunsmore
(1907) 
Washington made repeated petitions to the Continental Congress
for provisions. He received a congressional delegation to check the
Army's conditions and expressed the urgency of the situation,
proclaiming: "Something must be done. Important alterations must
be made." He recommended that Congress expedite supplies, and Congress agreed to strengthen and fund
the army's supply lines by reorganizing the commissary department. By late February, supplies began
arriving.[124]
Page 14
Baron [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_von_Steuben"] Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben's incessant drilling soon
transformed Washington's recruits into a disciplined fighting
force,[171] and the revitalized army emerged from Valley Forge
early the following year.[172] Washington promoted Von Steuben to
Major General and made him chief of staff.[173]
In early 1778, the French responded to Burgoyne's defeat and
entered into a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Alliance_(1778)"] Treaty of Alliance with the Americans. The
Continental Congress ratified the treaty in May, which amounted to
a French declaration of war against Britain.[174]  Washington Rallying the Troops at
Monmouth, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Leutze"] Emanuel Leutze (1851–
The British evacuated Philadelphia for New York that June and 1854)
Washington summoned a war council of American and French
Generals. He chose a partial attack on the retreating British at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Monmouth"] Battle of Monmouth; the British were
commanded by Howe's successor General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clinton_(British_Army_officer,_born_1730)"] Henry Clinton. Generals [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lee_(general)"] Charles Lee and Lafayette moved with
4,000 men, without Washington's knowledge, and bungled their first attack on June 28. Washington
relieved Lee and achieved a draw after an expansive battle. At nightfall, the British continued their retreat
to New York, and Washington moved his army outside the city.[175] Monmouth was Washington's last
battle in the North; he valued the safety of his army more than towns with little value to the British.[176]
West Point espionage
Washington became "America's first spymaster" by designing an espionage system against the British.[177]
In 1778, Major [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Tallmadge"] Benjamin Tallmadge formed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culper_Ring"] Culper Ring at Washington's direction to covertly collect
information about the British in New York.[178] Washington had disregarded incidents of disloyalty by
 Benedict Arnold, who had distinguished himself in many battles.[179]
During mid-1780, Arnold began supplying British spymaster [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Andr%C3%A9"] John André with sensitive information
intended to compromise Washington and capture [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Point,_New_York"] West Point, a key American defensive position on the
 Hudson River.[180] Historians have noted as possible reasons for Arnold's defection to be his anger at
losing promotions to junior officers, or repeated slights from Congress. He was also deeply in debt,
 profiteering from the war, and disappointed by Washington's lack of support during his eventual court-
martial.[181]
Arnold repeatedly asked for command of West Point, and
Washington finally agreed in August.[182] Arnold met André on
September 21, giving him plans to take over the garrison.[183]
Militia forces captured André and discovered the plans, but Arnold
escaped to New York.[184] Washington recalled the commanders
positioned under Arnold at key points around the fort to prevent
any complicity, but he did not suspect Arnold's wife Peggy.
Washington assumed personal command at West Point and
reorganized its defenses.[185] André's trial for espionage ended in a
death sentence, and Washington offered to return him to the British
in exchange for Arnold, but [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clinton_(British_Army_officer,_born_1730)"] Clinton refused. André was hanged on
October 2, 1780, despite his last request being to face a firing
squad, to deter other spies.[186]

Southern theater and Yorktown

In late 1778, General Clinton shipped 3,000 troops from New York to
Georgia and launched a Southern invasion against Savannah, reinforced by
2,000 British and Loyalist troops. They repelled an attack by Patriots and
 French naval forces, which bolstered the British war effort.[187]
 In June 1778, Iroquois warriors joined with Loyalist rangers led by Walter
Butler and killed more than 200 frontiersmen in June, laying waste to the
 Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania.[188] In mid-1779, in response to this and
other attacks on New England towns, Washington ordered General John
Sullivan to lead an expedition to force the Iroquois out of New York by
effecting "the total destruction and devastation" of their villages and by
taking their women and children hostage.[189][190] The expedition
systematically destroyed Iroquois villages and food stocks, and forced at
least 5,036 Iroquois to flee to British Canada. The campaign directly killed
 a few hundred Iroquois, but according to anthropologist Anthony F. C.
Wallace, the net effect of the campaign was to reduce the Iroquois by half, 
French King [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XVI_of_France"] Louis XVI allied
with Washington and Patriot
American colonists
who became unable to support themselves or survive the harsh winter of
1779–1780. Rhiannon Koehler estimates that as many as 5,500 Iroquois,
around 55.5% of the population, may have perished as a result of the campaign, which some historians
have described as genocidal.[191][192]
Washington's troops went into quarters at Morristown, New Jersey during the winter of 1779–1780 and
suffered their worst winter of the war, with temperatures well below freezing. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Harbor"] New York Harbor was
frozen over, snow and ice covered the ground for weeks, and the troops again lacked provisions.[193]
Clinton assembled 12,500 troops and attacked [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina"] Charlestown, South Carolina in January 1780, defeating
General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Lincoln"] Benjamin Lincoln who had only 5,100 Continental troops.[194] The British went on to occupy the
 South Carolina [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_(United_States)"] Piedmont in June, with no Patriot resistance. Clinton returned to New York and left 8,000
troops commanded by General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cornwallis,_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis"] Charles Cornwallis.[195] Congress replaced Lincoln with Horatio Gates; he
failed in South Carolina and was replaced by Washington's choice of Nathaniel Greene, but the British
already had the South in their grasp. Washington was reinvigorated, however, when Lafayette returned
from France with more ships, men, and supplies,[196] and 5,000 veteran French troops led by Marshal
 Rochambeau arrived at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport,_Rhode_Island"] Newport, Rhode Island in July 1780.[197] French naval forces then landed, led by
Admiral Grasse, and Washington encouraged Rochambeau to move his fleet south to launch a joint land
and naval attack on Arnold's troops.[198]
Washington's army went into winter quarters at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Windsor,_New_York"] New Windsor, New York in December 1780, and
Washington urged Congress and state officials to expedite provisions in hopes that the army would not
"continue to struggle under the same difficulties they have hitherto endured".[199] On March 1, 1781,
Congress ratified the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation"] Articles of Confederation, but the government that took effect on March 2 did not
have the power to levy taxes, and it loosely held the states together.[200]
General Clinton sent Benedict Arnold, now a British Brigadier General with 1,700 troops, to Virginia to
capture [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth,_Virginia"] Portsmouth and conduct raids on Patriot forces from there; Washington responded by sending
Lafayette south to counter Arnold's efforts.[201] Washington initially hoped to bring the fight to New York,
drawing off British forces from Virginia and ending the war there, but Rochambeau advised Grasse that
 Cornwallis in Virginia was the better target. Grasse's fleet arrived off the Virginia coast, and Washington
saw the advantage. He made a feint towards Clinton in New York, then headed south to Virginia.[202]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown"] Siege of Yorktown was a decisive Allied victory by the combined forces of the Continental Army
commanded by General Washington, the French Army commanded by the General Comte de
Rochambeau, and the French Navy commanded by Admiral [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Joseph_Paul_de_Grasse"] de Grasse, in the defeat of Cornwallis' British
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Joseph_Paul_de_Grasse"]
Page 16
forces. On August 19, the march to Yorktown led by Washington
 and Rochambeau began, which is known now as the "celebrated
march".[203] Washington was in command of an army of 7,800
Frenchmen, 3,100 militia, and 8,000 Continentals. Not well
experienced in siege warfare, Washington often referred to the
judgment of General Rochambeau and used his advice about how
to proceed; however, Rochambeau never challenged Washington's
authority as the battle's commanding officer.[204]
By late September, Patriot-French forces surrounded Yorktown,
trapped the British army, and prevented British reinforcements from
Clinton in the North, while the French navy emerged victorious at 
 Siege of Yorktown, Generals
Washington and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Donatien_de_Vimeur,_comte_de_Rochambeau"] Rochambeau give
last orders before the attack
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Chesapeake"] Battle of the Chesapeake. The final American offensive was
begun with a shot fired by Washington.[205] The siege ended with a British surrender on October 19, 1781;
over 7,000 British soldiers were made [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war"] prisoners of war, in the last major land battle of the American
Revolutionary War.[206] Washington negotiated the terms of surrender for two days, and the official signing
 ceremony took place on October 19; Cornwallis claimed illness and was absent, sending General Charles
O'Hara as his proxy.[207] As a gesture of goodwill, Washington held a dinner for the American, French,
and British generals, all of whom fraternized on friendly terms and identified with one another as members
of the same professional military caste.[208]
After the surrender at Yorktown, a situation developed that threatened relations between the newly
independent America and Britain.[209] Following a series of retributive executions between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)"] Patriots and
Loyalists, Washington, on May 18, 1782, wrote in a letter to General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Hazen"] Moses Hazen[210] that a British
captain would be executed in retaliation for the execution of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Huddy"] Joshua Huddy, a popular Patriot leader, who
was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging"] hanged at the direction of the Loyalist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lippincott_(Loyalist)"] Richard Lippincott. Washington wanted Lippincott himself to be
executed but was rebuffed.[211] Subsequently, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Charles_Asgill,_2nd_Baronet"] Charles Asgill was chosen instead, by a drawing of lots
from a hat. This was a violation of the 14th article of the Yorktown Articles of Capitulation, which
protected prisoners of war from acts of retaliation.[210][212] Later, Washington's feelings on matters
changed and in a letter of November 13, 1782, to Asgill, he acknowledged Asgill's letter and situation,
expressing his desire not to see any harm come to him.[213] After much consideration between the
 Continental Congress, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton, Washington, and appeals from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XVI_of_France"] French Crown, Asgill was
finally released,[214] where Washington issued Asgill a pass that allowed his passage to New
York.[215][210]
Demobilization and resignation
 General George Washington
 Resigning His Commission, by John
Trumbull, 1824 
When peace negotiations began in April 1782, both the British and
French began gradually evacuating their forces.[216] The American
treasury was empty, unpaid, and mutinous soldiers forced the
adjournment of Congress, and Washington dispelled unrest by
suppressing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newburgh_Conspiracy"] Newburgh Conspiracy in March 1783; Congress
promised officers a five-year bonus.[217] Washington submitted an
account of $450,000 in expenses which he had advanced to the
army. The account was settled, though it was allegedly vague about
large sums and included expenses his wife had incurred through
visits to his headquarters.[218]
 The following month, a Congressional committee led by Alexander
Hamilton began adapting the army for peacetime. In August 1783, Washington gave the Army's
perspective to the committee in his Sentiments on a Peace Establishment.[219] He advised Congress to
Page 17
keep a standing army, create a "national militia" of separate state units, and establish a navy and a national
military academy.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)"] Treaty of Paris was signed on September 3, 1783, and Great Britain officially recognized the
independence of the United States. Washington then disbanded his army, giving a farewell address to his
 soldiers on November 2.[220] During this time, Washington oversaw the evacuation of British forces in
New York and was greeted by parades and celebrations. There he announced that Colonel Henry Knox
had been promoted commander-in-chief.[221] Washington and Governor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clinton_(vice_president)"] George Clinton took formal
possession of the city on November 25.[222]
 In early December 1783, Washington bade farewell to his officers at Fraunces Tavern and resigned as
commander-in-chief soon thereafter, refuting Loyalist predictions that he would not relinquish his military
command.[223] In a final appearance in uniform, he gave a statement to the Congress: "I consider it an
indispensable duty to close this last solemn act of my official life, by commending the interests of our
dearest country to the protection of Almighty God, and those who have the superintendence of them, to his
holy keeping."[224] Washington's resignation was acclaimed at home and abroad and showed a skeptical
world that the new republic would not degenerate into chaos.[225][l]
The same month, Washington was appointed president-general of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_the_Cincinnati"] Society of the Cincinnati, a newly
established hereditary fraternity of Revolutionary War officers. He served in this capacity for the remainder
of his life.[227][m]

1784, and he received a constant stream of visitors wishing to pay their respects to
him at Mount Vernon.[231]
 Washington reactivated his interests in the Great Dismal Swamp and Potomac
canal projects begun before the war, though neither paid him any dividends, and
he undertook a 34-day, 680-mile (1090 km) trip to check on his land holdings in
the Ohio Country.[232] He oversaw the completion of the remodeling work at
Mount Vernon, which transformed his residence into the mansion that survives to
this day—although his financial situation was not strong. Creditors paid him in
depreciated wartime currency, and he owed significant amounts in taxes and
wages. Mount Vernon had made no profit during his absence, and he saw
persistently poor crop yields due to pestilence and poor weather. His estate
recorded its eleventh year running at a deficit in 1787, and there was little prospect
of improvement.[233] Washington undertook a new landscaping plan and
succeeded in cultivating a range of fast-growing trees and shrubs that were native
to North America.[234] He also began [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_husbandry"] breeding [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule"] mules after having been gifted a
Spanish [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey"] jack by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Charles_III_of_Spain"] King Charles III of Spain in 1784. There were few mules in the
United States at that time, and he believed that properly bred mules would
revolutionize [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture"] agriculture and transportation.[235]

Constitutional Convention of 1787  Lafayette
February 1,
Before returning to private life in June  1784[229]
1783, Washington called for a strong
union. Though he was concerned that he
might be criticized for meddling in civil matters, he sent a circular
letter to all the states, maintaining that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation"] Articles of Confederation
was no more than "a rope of sand" linking the states. He believed
the nation was on the verge of "anarchy and confusion",  was
vulnerable to foreign intervention, and that a national constitution
would unify the states under a strong central government.[236]
When [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays%27_Rebellion"] Shays' Rebellion erupted in Massachusetts on August 29,
1786, over taxation, Washington was further convinced that a
 Shays' Rebellion confirmed for
Washington the need to overhaul the
Articles of Confederation. 
national constitution was needed.[237] Some nationalists feared that
the new republic had descended into lawlessness, and they met
together on September 11, 1786, at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis_Convention_(1786)"] Annapolis to ask Congress to
revise the Articles of Confederation. One of their biggest efforts,
however, was getting Washington to attend.[238] Congress agreed
to a Constitutional Convention to be held in Philadelphia in Spring 1787, and each state was to send
delegates.[239]
On December 4, 1786, Washington was chosen to lead the Virginia delegation, but he declined on
 December 21. He had concerns about the legality of the convention and consulted James Madison, Henry
Knox, and others. They persuaded him to attend it, however, as his presence might induce reluctant states
to send delegates and smooth the way for the ratification process.[240] On March 28, Washington told
Governor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Randolph"] Edmund Randolph that he would attend the convention but made it clear that he was urged to
attend.[241]
Washington arrived in Philadelphia on May 9, 1787,
though a quorum was not attained until Friday, May 25.
Benjamin Franklin nominated Washington to preside over
the convention, and he was unanimously elected to serve
as president general.[242] The convention's  state-
mandated purpose was to revise the Articles of
Confederation with "all such alterations and further
provisions" required to improve them, and the new
government would be established when the resulting
document was "duly confirmed by the several
states".[243] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Randolph"] Governor Edmund Randolph of Virginia
introduced Madison's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Plan"] Virginia Plan on May 27, the third
day of the convention. It called for an entirely new
constitution and a sovereign national government, which
Washington highly recommended.[244] 
 Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the
United States by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Chandler_Christy"] Howard Chandler Christy,

Washington wrote [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton on July 10: "I almost despair of seeing a favorable issue to the
proceedings of our convention and do therefore repent having had any agency in the business."[245]
Nevertheless, he lent his prestige to the goodwill and work of the other delegates. He unsuccessfully
lobbied many to support ratification of the Constitution, such as anti-federalist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Henry"] Patrick Henry; Washington
told him "the adoption of it under the present circumstances of the Union is in my opinion desirable" and
declared the alternative would be anarchy.[246] Washington and Madison then spent four days at Mount
Vernon evaluating the new government's transition.[247]
Page 19
Chancellor of William & Mary
In 1788, the Board of Visitors of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_William_%26_Mary"] College of William & Mary decided to re-establish the position of
Chancellor, and elected Washington to the office on January 18.[248] The College Rector Samuel Griffin
wrote to Washington inviting him to the post, and in a letter dated April 30, 1788, Washington accepted the
position of the 14th [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_College_of_William_%26_Mary"] Chancellor of the College of William & Mary.[248][249] He continued to serve in the
post through his presidency until his death on December 14, 1799.[248]
First presidential election
The delegates to the Convention anticipated a Washington presidency and left it to him to define the office
once elected.[245][n] The state electors under the Constitution voted for the president on February 4, 1789,
and Washington suspected that most republicans had not voted for him.[251] The mandated March 4 date
passed without a Congressional quorum to count the votes, but a quorum was reached on April 5. The
votes were tallied the next day,[252] and Congressional Secretary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Thomson"] Charles Thomson was sent to Mount
Vernon to tell Washington he had been elected president. Washington won the majority of every state's
electoral votes; John Adams received the next highest number of votes and therefore became vice
president.[253] Washington had "anxious and painful sensations" about leaving the "domestic felicity" of
Mount Vernon, but departed for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City"] New York City on April 16 to be inaugurated.[254]
Presidency (1789–1797)
 Washington was inaugurated on April 30, 1789, taking the oath of
office at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Hall"] Federal Hall in New York City.[255][o] His coach was led by
militia and a marching band and followed by statesmen and foreign
dignitaries in an inaugural parade, with a crowd of 10,000.[257]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Inaugural_Bible"] Chancellor Robert R. Livingston administered the oath, using a Bible
provided by the Masons, after which the militia fired a 13-gun
salute.[258] Washington read a speech in the Senate Chamber, asking
"that Almighty Being who rules over the universe, who presides in the
councils of nations—and whose providential aids can supply every
human defect, consecrate the liberties and happiness of the people of
the United States".[259] Though he wished to serve without a salary,
President George Washington, 
Congress insisted adamantly that he accept it, later providing
Washington $25,000 per year to defray costs of the presidency.[260]
Gilbert Stuart (1795) 
Washington wrote to James Madison: "As the first of everything in our
situation will serve to establish a precedent, it is devoutly wished on
my part that these precedents be fixed on true principles."[261] To that end, he preferred the title "Mr.
President" over more majestic names proposed by the Senate, including "His Excellency" and "His
Highness the President".[262] His executive precedents included the inaugural address, messages to
Congress, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States"] cabinet form of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States"] executive branch.[263]
Washington had planned to resign after his first term, but the political strife in the nation convinced him he
should remain in office.[264] He was an able administrator and a judge of talent and character, and he
regularly talked with department heads to get their advice.[265] He tolerated opposing views, despite fears
that a democratic system would lead to political violence, and he conducted a smooth transition of power to
Page 20
his successor.[266] He remained non-partisan throughout his presidency and opposed the divisiveness of
political parties, but he favored a strong central government, was sympathetic to a Federalist form of
government, and leery of the Republican opposition.[267]
Washington dealt with major problems. The old [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation_Period"] Confederation lacked the powers to handle its workload
and had weak leadership, no executive, a small bureaucracy of clerks, a large debt, worthless paper money,
and no power to establish taxes.[268] He had the task of assembling an executive department and relied on
 Tobias Lear for advice selecting its officers.[269] Great Britain refused to relinquish its forts in the American
West,[268] and Barbary pirates preyed on American merchant ships in the Mediterranean at a time when the
United States did not even have a navy.[270]
Cabinet and executive departments
Congress created executive departments in 1789, including the
 State Department in July, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_War"] Department of War in August, and
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury"] Treasury Department in September. Washington appointed
 fellow Virginian Edmund Randolph as Attorney General, Samuel
Osgood as Postmaster General, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"] Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of
State, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Knox"] Henry Knox as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War"] Secretary of War. Finally, he appointed
 Alexander Hamilton as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury"] Secretary of the Treasury. Washington's
cabinet became a consulting and advisory body, not mandated by
the Constitution.[271]
Washington's cabinet members formed rival parties with sharply
opposing views, most fiercely illustrated between Hamilton and
Jefferson.[272] Washington restricted cabinet discussions to topics
of his choosing, without participating in the debate. He
occasionally requested cabinet opinions in writing and expected
department heads to agreeably carry out his decisions.[268]
Domestic issues
Washington was apolitical and opposed the formation of parties,
suspecting that conflict would undermine republicanism.[273] He
exercised great restraint in using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_vetoes"] his veto power, writing that "I
give my Signature to many Bills with which my Judgment is at
variance…."[274]
 His closest advisors formed two factions, portending the First Party
System. Secretary of the Treasury [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton formed the
 Federalist Party to promote national credit and a financially
powerful nation. Secretary of State [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"] Thomas Jefferson opposed
Hamilton's agenda and founded the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party"] Jeffersonian Republicans.
Washington favored Hamilton's agenda, however, and it ultimately
went into effect—resulting in bitter controversy.[275]

benefits, and humbly to implore His protection and favor." He spent that day fasting and visiting debtors in
prison to provide them with food and beer.[276]

African Americans
In response to two antislavery petitions that were presented to Congress in 1790, slaveholders in Georgia
and South Carolina objected and threatened to "blow the trumpet of civil war". Washington and Congress
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_Acts_of_1792"] responded with a series of racist measures: naturalized citizenship was denied to black immigrants; blacks
were barred from serving in state militias; the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Territory"] Southwest Territory that would soon become the state of
Tennessee was permitted to maintain slavery; and two more slave states were admitted (Kentucky in 1792,
and Tennessee in 1796). On February 12, 1793, Washington signed into law the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1793"] Fugitive Slave Act, which
overrode state laws and courts, allowing agents to cross state lines to capture and return escaped slaves.[277]
Many free blacks in the north decried the law believing it would allow bounty hunting and the kidnappings
of blacks.[278] The Fugitive Slave Act gave effect to the Constitution's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Clause"] Fugitive Slave Clause, and the Act
was passed overwhelmingly in Congress (e.g. the vote was 48 to 7 in the House).[279]
 On the anti-slavery side of the ledger, in 1789 Washington signed a reenactment of the Northwest
Ordinance which had freed all slaves brought after 1787 into a vast expanse of federal territory north of the
 Ohio River, except for slaves escaping from slave states.[280][281] That 1787 law lapsed when the new
U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1789.[282] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_Trade_Act_of_1794"] Slave Trade Act of 1794, which sharply limited American
involvement in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade"] Atlantic slave trade, was also signed by Washington. [283] And, Congress acted on
February 18, 1791, to admit the free state of Vermont into the Union as the 14th state as of March 4,
1791.[284]
National Bank
The President's House in
Philadelphia was Washington's
residence from 1790 to 1797
customs duties and excise taxes.[287] 
Washington's first term was largely devoted to economic concerns,
in which Hamilton had devised various plans to address
matters.[285] The establishment of public credit became a primary
challenge for the federal government.[286] Hamilton submitted a
report to a deadlocked Congress, and he, Madison, and Jefferson
reached the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1790"] Compromise of 1790 in which Jefferson agreed to
Hamilton's debt proposals in exchange for moving the nation's
capital temporarily to Philadelphia and then south near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_(Washington,_D.C.)"] Georgetown
on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River"] Potomac River.[275] The terms were legislated in the
 Funding Act of 1790 and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residence_Act"] Residence Act, both of which
Washington signed into law. Congress authorized the assumption
and payment of the nation's debts, with funding provided by
 Hamilton created controversy among Cabinet members by advocating establishing the First Bank of the
United States. Madison and Jefferson objected, but the bank easily passed Congress. Jefferson and
 Randolph insisted that the new bank was beyond the authority granted by the constitution, as Hamilton
believed. Washington sided with Hamilton and signed the legislation on February 25, and the rift became
openly hostile between Hamilton and Jefferson.[288]
The nation's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1792"] first financial crisis occurred in March 1792. Hamilton's Federalists exploited large loans to
gain control of U.S. debt securities, causing a run on the national bank;[289] the markets returned to normal
by mid-April.[290] Jefferson believed Hamilton was part of the scheme, despite Hamilton's efforts to
ameliorate, and Washington again found himself in the middle of a feud.[291]
Jefferson–Hamilton feud
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Philadelphia_Presidents_house.jpg"]
Page 22
Jefferson and Hamilton adopted diametrically
opposed political principles. Hamilton believed in a
strong national government requiring a national bank
and foreign loans to function, while Jefferson
believed the states and the farm element should
primarily direct the government; he also resented the
idea of banks and foreign loans. To Washington's
dismay, the two men persistently entered into disputes
and infighting.[292] Hamilton demanded that
Jefferson resign if he could not support Washington,
and Jefferson told Washington that Hamilton's fiscal
system would lead to the overthrow of the
Republic.[293] Washington urged them to call a truce
for the nation's sake, but they ignored him.[294] 
Jefferson and Hamilton
 Thomas Jefferson [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton
Washington reversed his decision to retire after his
first term to minimize party strife, but the feud continued after his re-election.[293] Jefferson's political
actions, his support of Freneau's National Gazette,[295] and his attempt to undermine Hamilton nearly led
Washington to dismiss him from the cabinet; Jefferson ultimately resigned his position in December 1793,
and Washington forsook him from that time on.[296]
The feud led to the well-defined Federalist and Republican parties, and party affiliation became necessary
for election to Congress by 1794.[297] Washington remained aloof from congressional attacks on Hamilton,
but he did not publicly protect him, either. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Reynolds_affair"] Hamilton–Reynolds sex scandal opened Hamilton to
disgrace, but Washington continued to hold him in "very high esteem" as the dominant force in establishing
federal law and government.[298]
Whiskey Rebellion
In March 1791, at Hamilton's urging, with support from Madison, Congress imposed an excise tax on
distilled spirits to help curtail the national debt, which took effect in July.[299] Grain farmers strongly
protested in Pennsylvania's frontier districts; they argued that they were unrepresented and were
shouldering too much of the debt, comparing their situation to excessive British taxation before the
Revolutionary War. On August 2, Washington assembled his cabinet to discuss how to deal with the
situation. Unlike Washington, who had reservations about using force, Hamilton had long waited for such a
situation and was eager to suppress the rebellion by using federal authority and force.[300] Not wanting to
involve the federal government if possible, Washington called on Pennsylvania state officials to take the
initiative, but they declined to take military action. On August 7, Washington issued his first proclamation
for calling up state militias. After appealing for peace, he reminded the protestors that, unlike the rule of the
British crown, the Federal law was issued by state-elected representatives.[301]
Threats and violence against tax collectors, however, escalated into defiance against federal authority in
1794 and gave rise to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion"] Whiskey Rebellion. Washington issued a final proclamation on September 25,
threatening the use of military force to no avail.[301] The federal army was not up to the task, so
Washington invoked the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia_Acts_of_1792"] Militia Act of 1792 to summon state militias.[302] Governors sent troops, initially
commanded by Washington, who gave the command to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Lee_III"] Light-Horse Harry Lee to lead them into the
rebellious districts. They took 150 prisoners, and the remaining rebels dispersed without further fighting.
Two of the prisoners were condemned to death, but Washington exercised his Constitutional authority for
the first time and pardoned them.[303]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:T_Jefferson_by_Charles_Willson_Peale_1791_2.jpg"]
Page 23
Washington's forceful action demonstrated that the new government could protect itself and its tax
collectors. This represented the first use of federal military force against the states and citizens,[304] and
remains the only time an incumbent president has commanded troops in the field. Washington justified his
action against "certain self-created societies",  which he regarded as "subversive organizations" that
threatened the national union. He did not dispute their right to protest, but he insisted that their dissent must
not violate federal law. Congress agreed and extended their congratulations to him; only Madison and
Jefferson expressed indifference.[305]
Foreign affairs 
In April 1792, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars"] French Revolutionary Wars began between Great Britain
and France, and Washington declared America's  neutrality. The
revolutionary government of France sent diplomat [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond-Charles_Gen%C3%AAt"] Citizen Genêt to
America, and he was welcomed with great enthusiasm. He created a
network of new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Societies"] Democratic-Republican Societies promoting France's
interests, but Washington denounced them and demanded that the French
recall Genêt.[306] The National Assembly of France granted Washington
honorary French citizenship on August 26, 1792, during the early stages of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution"] French Revolution.[307] Hamilton formulated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Treaty"] Jay Treaty to
normalize trade relations with Great Britain while removing them from
 John Jay, negotiator of the
 Jay Treaty 
western forts, and also to resolve financial debts remaining from the
Revolution.[308] Chief Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay"] John Jay acted as Washington's negotiator
and signed the treaty on November 19, 1794; critical Jeffersonians,
however, supported France. Washington deliberated, then supported the
treaty because it avoided war with Britain,[309] but was disappointed that
its provisions favored Britain.[310] He mobilized public opinion and secured ratification in the Senate[311]
but faced frequent public criticism.[312]
The British agreed to abandon their forts around the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes"] Great Lakes, and the United States modified the
boundary with Canada. The government liquidated numerous pre-Revolutionary debts, and the British
opened the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_West_Indies"] British West Indies to American trade. The treaty secured peace with Britain and a decade of
prosperous trade. Jefferson claimed that it angered France and "invited rather than avoided" war.[313]
Relations with France deteriorated afterward, leaving succeeding president [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams"] John Adams with prospective
war.[314] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe"] James Monroe was the American Minister to France, but Washington recalled him for his
opposition to the Treaty. The French refused to accept his replacement [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cotesworth_Pinckney"] Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, and
the French Directory declared the authority to seize American ships two days before Washington's term
ended.[315]
Native American affairs
 Ron Chernow describes Washington as always trying to be even-handed in dealing with the Natives. He
states that Washington hoped they would abandon their itinerant hunting life and adapt to fixed agricultural
communities in the manner of white settlers. He also maintains that Washington never advocated outright
confiscation of tribal land or the forcible removal of tribes and that he berated American settlers who
abused natives, admitting that he held out no hope for pacific relations with the natives as long as "frontier
settlers entertain the opinion that there is not the same crime (or indeed no crime at all) in killing a native as
in killing a white man."[316]
Page 24
By contrast, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_G._Calloway"] Colin G. Calloway writes that "Washington had a lifelong
obsession with getting Indian land, either for himself or for his nation, and
initiated policies and campaigns that had devastating effects in Indian
country."[317] "The growth of the nation," Galloway has stated,
"demanded the dispossession of Indian people. Washington hoped the
process could be bloodless and that Indian people would give up their
lands for a "fair" price and move away. But if Indians refused and
resisted, as they often did, he felt he had no choice but to "extirpate" them
and that the expeditions he sent to destroy Indian towns were therefore
entirely justified."[318]
 Seneca chief [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Jacket"] Red Jacket was
Washington's peace emissary
 with the Northwestern
Confederacy. 
During the Fall of 1789, Washington had to contend with the British
refusing to evacuate their forts in the Northwest frontier and their
 concerted efforts to incite hostile Indian tribes to attack [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Americans"] American
settlers.[319][p] The Northwest tribes under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_people"] Miami chief [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Turtle"] Little Turtle allied
with the British Army to resist American expansion, and killed 1,500
settlers between 1783 and 1790.[320]
As documented by Harless (2018),  Washington declared that "The
Government of the United States are determined that their Administration
of Indian Affairs shall be directed entirely by the great principles of Justice and humanity",[321] and
provided that treaties should negotiate their land interests.[321] The administration regarded powerful tribes
as foreign nations, and Washington even smoked a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_pipe"] peace pipe and drank wine with them at the
 Philadelphia presidential house.[322] He made numerous attempts to conciliate them;[323] he equated killing
indigenous peoples with killing whites and sought to integrate them into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Americans"] European American culture.[324]
Secretary of War [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Knox"] Henry Knox also attempted to encourage agriculture among the tribes.[323]
In the Southwest, negotiations failed between federal commissioners and raiding Indian tribes seeking
retribution. Washington invited [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscogee"] Creek Chief [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_McGillivray"] Alexander McGillivray and 24 leading chiefs to New York to
 negotiate a treaty and treated them like foreign dignitaries. Knox and McGillivray concluded the Treaty of
New York on August 7, 1790, in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Hall"] Federal Hall, which provided the tribes with agricultural supplies and
McGillivray with a rank of Brigadier General Army and a salary of $1,500.[325]
In 1790, Washington sent Brigadier General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Harmar"] Josiah Harmar to
pacify the Northwest tribes, but Little Turtle routed him twice and
forced him to withdraw.[326] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_Confederacy"] Northwestern Confederacy of
tribes used guerrilla tactics and were an effective force against the
sparsely manned American Army. Washington sent Major General
 Arthur St. Clair from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Washington_(Ohio)"] Fort Washington on an expedition to restore
peace in the territory in 1791. On November 4, St. Clair's forces
were ambushed and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Clair%27s_defeat"] soundly defeated by tribal forces with few
survivors,[327] despite Washington's warning of surprise attacks.
Washington was outraged over what he viewed to be excessive
Native American brutality and execution of captives, including
women and children.[328] 
Battle of Fallen Timbers by R. F.
Zogbaum, 1896. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Country"] Ohio Country
was ceded to America in its
aftermath.
St. Clair resigned his commission, and Washington replaced him
with the Revolutionary War hero General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Wayne"] Anthony Wayne. From 1792 to 1793, Wayne instructed his
troops on Native American warfare tactics and instilled discipline which was lacking under St. Clair.[329] In
August 1794, Washington sent Wayne into tribal territory with authority to drive them out by burning their
Page 25
villages and crops in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maumee,_Ohio"] Maumee Valley.[330] On August 24, the American army under Wayne's leadership
defeated the western confederacy at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fallen_Timbers"] Battle of Fallen Timbers, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Greenville"] Treaty of Greenville in August
1795 opened up two-thirds of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Country"] Ohio Country for American settlement.[331]
Second term
Originally, Washington had planned to retire after his first term, while many Americans could not imagine
anyone else taking his place.[332] After nearly four years as president, and dealing with the infighting in his
own cabinet and with partisan critics, Washington showed little enthusiasm in running for a second term,
while Martha also wanted him not to run.[333] James Madison urged him not to retire, that his absence
would only allow the dangerous political rift in his cabinet and the House to worsen. Jefferson also pleaded
with him not to retire and agreed to drop his attacks on Hamilton, or he would also retire if Washington
did.[334] Hamilton maintained that Washington's absence would be "deplored as the greatest evil" to the
country at this time.[335] Washington's close nephew George Augustine Washington, his manager at Mount
Vernon, was critically ill and had to be replaced, further increasing Washington's desire to retire and return
to Mount Vernon.[336]
When the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1792_United_States_presidential_election"] election of 1792 neared, Washington did not publicly announce his presidential candidacy. Still,
he silently consented to run to prevent a further political-personal rift in his cabinet. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College"] Electoral College
unanimously elected him president on February 13, 1793, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams"] John Adams as vice president by a vote of
77 to 50.[324] Washington, with nominal fanfare, arrived alone at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_Washington"] his inauguration in his carriage. Sworn
 into office by Associate Justice William Cushing on March 4, 1793, in the Senate Chamber of Congress
Hall in Philadelphia, Washington gave a brief address and then immediately retired to his Philadelphia
presidential house, weary of office and in poor health.[337]
On April 22, 1793, during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution"] French Revolution, Washington
issued his famous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_Neutrality"] Neutrality Proclamation and was resolved to
pursue "a conduct friendly and impartial toward the belligerent
Powers" while he warned Americans not to intervene in the
international conflict. [338] Although Washington recognized
France's revolutionary government, he would eventually ask
French minister to America [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond-Charles_Gen%C3%AAt"] Citizen Genêt be recalled over the
Citizen Genêt Affair.[339] Genêt was a diplomatic troublemaker
who was openly hostile toward Washington's neutrality policy. He
procured four American ships as privateers to strike at Spanish
forces (British allies) in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"] Florida while organizing militias to strike at
other British possessions. However, his efforts failed to draw
America into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars"] foreign campaigns during Washington's 
 USS Constitution: Commissioned
and named by President Washington
in 1794
presidency.[340] On July 31, 1793, Jefferson submitted his
resignation from Washington's cabinet.[341] Washington signed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Act_of_1794"] Naval Act of 1794 and commissioned
the first six federal frigates to combat [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_pirates"] Barbary pirates.[342]
In January 1795, Hamilton, who desired more income for his family, resigned office and was replaced by
Washington appointment [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Wolcott_Jr."] Oliver Wolcott, Jr. Washington and Hamilton remained friends. However,
Washington's relationship with his Secretary of War Henry Knox deteriorated. Knox resigned office on the
rumor he profited from construction contracts on U.S. Frigates.[343]
In the final months of his presidency, Washington was assailed by his political foes and a partisan press
who accused him of being ambitious and greedy, while he argued that he had taken no salary during the
war and had risked his life in battle. He regarded the press as a disuniting, "diabolical" force of falsehoods,
sentiments that he expressed in his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington%27s_Farewell_Address"] Farewell Address.[344] At the end of his second term, Washington
Page 26
retired for personal and political reasons, dismayed with personal attacks, and to ensure that a truly
contested presidential election could be held. He did not feel bound to a two-term limit, but his retirement
set a significant precedent. Washington is often credited with setting the principle of a two-term presidency,
but it was Thomas Jefferson who first refused to run for a third term on political grounds.[345]
Farewell Address
In 1796, Washington declined to run for a third term of office,
believing his death in office would create an image of a lifetime
appointment. The precedent of a two-term limit was created by his
retirement from office.[346] In May 1792, in anticipation of his
retirement, Washington instructed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison to prepare a
"[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valedictorian"] valedictory address", an initial draft of which was entitled the
"Farewell Address".[347] In May 1796, Washington sent the
manuscript to his Secretary of Treasury [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton who
did an extensive rewrite, while Washington provided final
 edits.[348] On September 19, 1796, David Claypoole's American
Daily Advertiser published the final version of the address.[349] 
 Washington's Farewell Address
(September 19, 1796)
Washington stressed that national identity was paramount, while a united America would safeguard
freedom and prosperity. He warned the nation of three eminent dangers: regionalism, partisanship, and
foreign entanglements, and said the "name of AMERICAN, which belongs to you, in your national
capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism, more than any appellation derived from local
discriminations."[350] Washington called for men to move beyond partisanship for the common good,
stressing that the United States must concentrate on its own interests. He warned against foreign alliances
and their influence in domestic affairs, and bitter partisanship and the dangers of political parties.[351] He
counseled friendship and commerce with all nations, but advised against involvement in European
wars.[352] He stressed the importance of religion, asserting that "religion and morality are indispensable
supports" in a republic.[353] Washington's address favored Hamilton's Federalist ideology and economic
policies.[354]
Washington closed the address by reflecting on his legacy:
Though in reviewing the incidents of my Administration I am unconscious of intentional error,
I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed
many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the
evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my country will never
cease to view them with indulgence, and that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its
service with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as
myself must soon be to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_14"] mansions of rest.[355]
After initial publication, many Republicans, including Madison, criticized the Address and believed it was
an anti-French campaign document. Madison believed Washington was strongly pro-British. Madison also
was suspicious of who authored the Address.[356]
In 1839, Washington biographer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Sparks"] Jared Sparks maintained that Washington's "... Farewell Address was
 printed and published with the laws, by order of the legislatures, as an evidence of the value they attached
 to its political precepts, and of their affection for its author."[357] In 1972, Washington scholar James
Page 27
 Flexner referred to the Farewell Address as receiving as much acclaim as Thomas Jefferson's Declaration
of Independence and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln"] Abraham Lincoln's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettysburg_Address"] Gettysburg Address.[358] In 2010, historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Chernow"] Ron Chernow
reported the Farewell Address proved to be one of the most influential statements on Republicanism.[359]
Post-presidency (1797–1799)
Retirement
Washington retired to Mount Vernon in March 1797 and devoted time to his plantations and other business
interests, including his distillery.[360] His plantation operations were only minimally profitable,[46] and his
lands in the west (Piedmont) were under Indian attacks and yielded little income, with the squatters there
refusing to pay rent. He attempted to sell these but without success.[361] He became an even more
 committed Federalist. He vocally supported the Alien and Sedition Acts and convinced Federalist John
Marshall to run for Congress to weaken the Jeffersonian hold on Virginia.[362]
Washington grew restless in retirement, prompted by tensions with France, and he wrote to Secretary of
 War James McHenry offering to organize President Adams' army.[363] In a continuation of the French
Revolutionary Wars, French privateers began seizing American ships in 1798, and relations deteriorated
with France and led to the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-War"] Quasi-War". Without consulting Washington, Adams nominated him for a
lieutenant general commission on July 4, 1798, and the position of commander-in-chief of the armies.[364]
Washington chose to accept, replacing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wilkinson"] James Wilkinson,[365] and he served as the commanding general
from July 13, 1798, until his death 17 months later. He participated in planning for a provisional army, but
he avoided involvement in details. In advising McHenry of potential officers for the army, he appeared to
make a complete break with Jefferson's Democratic-Republicans: "you could as soon scrub the blackamoor
white, as to change the principles of a profest Democrat; and that he will leave nothing unattempted to
overturn the government of this country."[366] Washington delegated the active leadership of the army to
Hamilton, a major general. No army invaded the United States during this period, and Washington did not
assume a field command.[367]
Washington was known to be rich because of the well-known "glorified façade of wealth and grandeur" at
Mount Vernon,[368] but nearly all his wealth was in the form of land and slaves rather than ready cash. To
supplement his income, he erected a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:George_Washington%27s_Distillery.JPG"] distillery for substantial whiskey production.[369] Historians estimate
that the estate was worth about $1 million in 1799 dollars,[370] equivalent to $15,967,000 in 2021. He
bought land parcels to spur development around the new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."] Federal City named in his honor, and he sold
individual lots to middle-income investors rather than multiple lots to large investors, believing they would
more likely commit to making improvements.[371]
Final days and death
On December 12, 1799, Washington inspected his farms on horseback. He returned home late and had
guests over for dinner. He had a sore throat the next day but was well enough to mark trees for cutting.
That evening, he complained of chest congestion but was still cheerful.[372] On Saturday, he awoke to an
inflamed throat and difficulty breathing, so he ordered estate overseer George Rawlins to remove nearly a
 pint of his blood; bloodletting was a common practice of the time. His family summoned Doctors James
Craik, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavus_Richard_Brown"] Gustavus Richard Brown, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisha_C._Dick"] Elisha C. Dick.[373] ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thornton"] Dr. William Thornton arrived some hours after
Washington died.)[374]
Page 28
Dr. Brown thought Washington had quinsy; Dr. Dick thought the
condition was a more serious "violent inflammation of the
throat".[375] They continued the process of bloodletting to
approximately five pints, and Washington's condition deteriorated
further. Dr. Dick proposed a tracheotomy, but the others were not
familiar with that procedure and therefore disapproved.[376]
Washington instructed Brown and Dick to leave the room, while he
assured Craik, "Doctor, I die hard, but I am not afraid to go."[377]
Washington on his Deathbed
 Junius Brutus Stearns 1799 
Washington's death came more swiftly than expected.[378] On his
deathbed, he instructed his private secretary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Lear"] Tobias Lear to wait
three days before his burial, out of fear of being entombed
alive.[379] According to Lear, he died peacefully between 10 and 11 p.m. on December 14, 1799, with
Martha seated at the foot of his bed. His last words were "'Tis well", from his conversation with Lear about
his burial. He was 67.[380]
Congress immediately adjourned for the day upon news of Washington's
death, and the Speaker's chair was shrouded in black the next morning.[381]
The funeral was held four days after his death on December 18, 1799, at
Mount Vernon, where his body was interred. Cavalry and foot soldiers led
the procession, and six colonels served as the pallbearers. The Mount
Vernon funeral service was restricted mostly to family and friends.[382]
Reverend Thomas Davis read the funeral service by the vault with a brief
address, followed by a ceremony performed by various members of
Washington's Masonic lodge in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia"] Alexandria, Virginia.[383] Congress chose
 Light-Horse Harry Lee to deliver the eulogy. Word of his death traveled
slowly; church bells rang in the cities, and many places of business
closed.[384] People worldwide admired Washington and were saddened by
his death, and memorial processions were held in major cities of the United
States. Martha wore a black mourning cape for one year, and she burned
their correspondence to protect their privacy. Only five letters between the
couple are known to have survived: two from Martha to George and three
from him to her.[385]

The diagnosis of Washington's illness and the immediate cause of his death have been subjects of debate
since the day he died. The published account of Drs. Craik and Brown[q] stated that his symptoms had
been consistent with cynanche trachealis (tracheal inflammation), a term of that period used to describe
severe inflammation of the upper windpipe, including quinsy. Accusations have persisted since
Washington's death concerning medical malpractice, with some believing he had been bled to death.[376]
Various modern medical authors have speculated that he died from a severe case of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiglottitis"] epiglottitis complicated
 by the given treatments, most notably the massive blood loss which almost certainly caused hypovolemic
shock.[387][r]
Burial, net worth, and aftermath
Washington was buried in the old Washington family vault at Mount Vernon, situated on a grassy slope
overspread with willow, juniper, cypress, and chestnut trees. It contained the remains of his brother
Lawrence and other family members, but the decrepit brick vault needed repair, prompting Washington to
leave instructions in his will for the construction of a new vault.[384] Washington's estate at the time of his
Page 29
death was worth an estimated $780,000 in 1799, approximately
equivalent to $17.82 million in 2021.[391] Washington's peak net
worth was $587.0 million, including his 300 slaves.[392]
Washington held title to more than 65,000 acres of land in 37
different locations.[88]
In 1830, a disgruntled ex-employee of the estate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_theft_of_George_Washington%27s_skull"] attempted to steal
what he thought was Washington's  skull, prompting the
construction of a more secure vault.[393] The next year, the new
vault was constructed at Mount Vernon to receive the remains of
George and Martha and other relatives.[394] In 1832, a joint
Congressional committee debated moving his body from Mount
Vernon to a crypt in the Capitol. The crypt had been built by
architect [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bulfinch"] Charles Bulfinch in the 1820s during the reconstruction of
the burned-out capital, after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_Washington"] Burning of Washington by the
British during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812"] War of 1812. Southern opposition was intense,
antagonized by an ever-growing rift between North and South;
many were concerned that Washington's remains could end up on
"a shore foreign to his native soil" if the country became divided,
and Washington's remains stayed in Mount Vernon.[395]

On October 7, 1837, Washington's remains were placed, still in the original lead coffin, within a marble
sarcophagus designed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Strickland_(architect)"] William Strickland and constructed by John Struthers earlier that year.[396] The
sarcophagus was sealed and encased with planks, and an outer vault was constructed around it.[397] The
outer vault has the sarcophagi of both George and Martha Washington; the inner vault has the remains of
other Washington family members and relatives.[394]
Personal life
Washington was somewhat reserved in personality, but he generally
had a strong presence among others. He made speeches and
announcements when required, but he was not a noted orator or
debater.[399] He was taller than most of his contemporaries;[400]
accounts of his height vary from 6 ft (1.83 m) to 6 ft 3.5 in (1.92 m)
tall,[80][401] he weighed between 210–220 pounds (95–100 kg) as
an adult,[402][403] and he was known for his great strength.[404] He
had grey-blue eyes and long reddish-brown hair which he wore
curled, powdered and tied in a queue in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1775%E2%80%931795_in_Western_fashion#Men's_fashion"] fashion of the day.[405]
He had a rugged and dominating presence, which garnered respect
from his peers.

teeth, which he wore during his presidency, made using a variety of
materials including both animal and human teeth, but wood was not
used despite common lore.[406] These dental problems left him in constant pain, for which he took
laudanum.[407] As a public figure, he relied upon the strict confidence of his dentist.[408]
Washington was a talented equestrian early in life. He collected thoroughbreds at Mount Vernon, and his
two favorite horses were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blueskin_(horse)"] Blueskin and Nelson.[409] Fellow Virginian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"] Thomas Jefferson said Washington
was "the best horseman of his age and the most graceful figure that could be seen on horseback";[410] he
Page 30
also hunted foxes, deer, ducks, and other game.[411] He was an
excellent dancer and attended the theater frequently. He drank in
moderation but was morally opposed to excessive drinking,
smoking tobacco, gambling, and profanity.[412]
Religion and Freemasonry
 Washington was descended from Anglican minister Lawrence
Washington (his great-great-grandfather), whose troubles with the
 Church of England may have prompted his heirs to emigrate to
America.[413] Washington was baptized as an infant in April 1732
and became a devoted member of the Church of England (the
Anglican Church).[414] He served more than 20 years as a
 vestryman and churchwarden for Fairfax Parish and Truro Parish,
Virginia.[415] He privately prayed and read the Bible daily, and he
publicly encouraged people and the nation to pray.[416] He may
have taken communion on a regular basis prior to the
Revolutionary War, but he did not do so following the war, for
which he was admonished by Pastor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Abercrombie_(Episcopal_priest)"] James Abercrombie.[417] 
George Washington's bookplate with
 the Coat of arms of the Washington
family
Washington believed in a "wise, inscrutable, and irresistible" Creator God
who was active in the Universe, contrary to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism"] deistic thought.[413] He
referred to God by the Enlightenment terms [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_providence"] Providence, the Creator, or the
Almighty, and also as the Divine Author or the Supreme Being.[418] He
believed in a divine power who watched over battlefields, was involved in
the outcome of war, was protecting his life, and was involved in American
politics—and specifically in the creation of the United States.[419][s]
Modern historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Chernow"] Ron Chernow has posited that Washington avoided
evangelistic Christianity or hellfire-and-brimstone speech along with
communion and anything inclined to "flaunt his religiosity". Chernow has
also said Washington "never used his religion as a device for partisan
purposes or in official undertakings".[421] No mention of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus"] Jesus Christ
appears in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Papers"] his private correspondence, and such references are rare in his
public writings.[422] He frequently quoted from the Bible or paraphrased it,
and often referred to the Anglican [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Common_Prayer"] Book of Common Prayer.[423] There is
debate on whether he is best classed as a Christian or a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theistic_rationalism"] theistic rationalist—
or both.[424] 
George Washington as
Master of his Lodge, 1793
Washington emphasized religious toleration in a nation with numerous denominations and religions. He
publicly attended services of different Christian denominations and prohibited anti-Catholic celebrations in
the Army.[425] He engaged workers at Mount Vernon without regard for religious belief or affiliation.
While president, he acknowledged major religious sects and gave speeches on religious toleration.[426] He
was distinctly rooted in the ideas, values, and modes of thinking of the Enlightenment,[427] but he harbored
no contempt of organized Christianity and its clergy, "being no bigot myself to any mode of worship".[427]
In 1793, speaking to members of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Church_(Swedenborgian)"] New Church in Baltimore, Washington proclaimed, "We have
abundant reason to rejoice that in this Land the light of truth and reason has triumphed over the power of
bigotry and superstition."[428]
Page 31
 Freemasonry was a widely accepted institution in the late 18th century, known for advocating moral
teachings.[429] Washington was attracted to the Masons' dedication to the Enlightenment principles of
rationality, reason, and brotherhood. The American Masonic lodges did not share the anti-clerical
perspective of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticlericalism_and_Freemasonry"] controversial European lodges.[430] A Masonic lodge was established in Fredericksburg
in September 1752, and Washington was initiated two months later at the age of 20 as one of its first
Entered Apprentices. Within a year, he progressed through its ranks to become a Master Mason.[431]
Washington had high regard for the Masonic Order, but his personal lodge attendance was sporadic. In
 1777, a convention of Virginia lodges asked him to be the Grand Master of the newly established Grand
Lodge of Virginia, but he declined due to his commitments leading the Continental Army. After 1782, he
frequently corresponded with Masonic lodges and members,[432] and he was listed as Master in the
Virginia charter of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington_Masonic_National_Memorial"] Alexandria Lodge No. 22 in 1788.[433]
Slavery
In Washington's lifetime, slavery was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery_in_Virginia"] deeply ingrained in
the economic and social fabric of Virginia.[434][435]
Slavery was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_colonial_history_of_the_United_States"] legal in all of the Thirteen Colonies prior to
the American Revolution.[436]
Washington's slaves
 Washington owned and rented enslaved African
Americans, and during his lifetime over 577 slaves lived
and worked at Mount Vernon.[437][438] He acquired them Washington as Farmer at Mount Vernon
through inheritance, gaining control of 84 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowry"] dower slaves [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junius_Brutus_Stearns"] Junius Brutus Stearns, 1851
upon his marriage to Martha, and purchased at least 71
slaves between 1752 and 1773.[439] From 1786 he rented
slaves, at his death he was renting 41.[440][437] His early views on slavery were no different from any
Virginia [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planter_class"] planter of the time.[441] From the 1760s his attitudes underwent a slow evolution. The first doubts
were prompted by his transition from tobacco to grain crops, which left him with a costly surplus of slaves,
causing him to question the system's economic efficiency.[442] His growing disillusionment with the
institution was spurred by the principles of the American Revolution and revolutionary friends such as
Lafayette and Hamilton.[443] Most historians agree the Revolution was central to the evolution of
Washington's attitudes on slavery;[444] "After 1783", Kenneth Morgan writes, "...[Washington] began to
express inner tensions about the problem of slavery more frequently, though always in private..."[445]
The many contemporary reports of slave treatment at Mount Vernon are varied and conflicting.[446]
Historian Kenneth Morgan (2000) maintains that Washington was frugal on spending for clothes and
bedding for his slaves, and only provided them with just enough food, and that he maintained strict control
over his slaves, instructing his overseers to keep them working hard from dawn to dusk year-round.[447]
However, historian Dorothy Twohig (2001) said: "Food, clothing, and housing seem to have been at least
adequate".[448] Washington faced growing debts involved with the costs of supporting slaves. He held an
"engrained sense of racial superiority" towards African Americans but harbored no ill feelings toward
them.[449] Some enslaved families worked at different locations on the plantation but were allowed to visit
one another on their days off.[450] Washington's slaves received two hours off for meals during the
workday and were given time off on Sundays and religious holidays.[451]
Page 32
Some accounts report that Washington opposed flogging but at times sanctioned its use, generally as a last
resort, on both men and women slaves.[452] Washington used both reward and punishment to encourage
discipline and productivity in his slaves. He tried appealing to an individual's sense of pride, gave better
blankets and clothing to the "most deserving", and motivated his slaves with cash rewards. He believed
"watchfulness and admonition" to be often better deterrents against transgressions but would punish those
who "will not do their duty by fair means".  Punishment ranged in severity from demotion back to
fieldwork, through whipping and beatings, to permanent separation from friends and family by sale.
Historian Ron Chernow maintains that overseers were required to warn slaves before resorting to the lash
and required Washington's written permission before whipping, though his extended absences did not
always permit this.[453] Washington remained dependent on slave labor to work his farms and negotiated
the purchase of more slaves in 1786 and 1787.[454]
Washington brought several of his slaves with him and his family to the
federal capital during his presidency. When the capital moved from New
York City to Philadelphia in 1791, the president began rotating his slave
household staff periodically between the capital and Mount Vernon.
 This was done deliberately to circumvent Pennsylvania's Slavery
Abolition Act, which, in part, automatically freed any slave who moved
to the state and lived there for more than six months.[455] In May 1796,
Martha's personal and favorite slave [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oney_Judge"] Oney Judge escaped to Portsmouth.
At Martha's behest, Washington attempted to capture Ona, using a
Treasury agent, but this effort failed. In February 1797, Washington's
personal slave [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_Posey"] Hercules escaped to Philadelphia and was never
found.[456]  Runaway advertisement for
 Oney Judge, enslaved servant
In February 1786, Washington took a census of Mount Vernon and
recorded 224 slaves.[457] By 1799, slaves at Mount Vernon totaled 317, 
in Washington's presidential
household
including 143 children.[458] Washington owned 124 slaves, leased 40,
and held 153 for his wife's dower interest.[459] Washington supported many slaves who were too young or
too old to work, greatly increasing Mount Vernon's slave population and causing the plantation to operate at
a loss.[460]
Abolition and manumission
Based on his letters, diary, documents, accounts from colleagues, employees, friends, and visitors,
Washington slowly developed a cautious sympathy toward [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States"] abolitionism that eventually ended with his will
 freeing his military/war valet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lee_(valet)"] Billy Lee, and then subsequently freeing the rest of his personally-owned
slaves outright upon Martha's death.[461] As president, he remained publicly silent on the topic of slavery,
believing it was a nationally divisive issue which could destroy the union.[462]
During the American Revolutionary War, Washington began to change his views on slavery.[436] In a 1778
letter to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lund_Washington"] Lund Washington, he made clear his desire "to get quit of Negroes" when discussing the exchange
of slaves for the land he wanted to buy.[463] The next year, Washington stated his intention not to separate
enslaved families as a result of "a change of masters".[464] During the 1780s, Washington privately
expressed his support for the gradual emancipation of slaves.[465] Between 1783 and 1786, he gave moral
support to a plan proposed by Lafayette to purchase land and free slaves to work on it, but declined to
participate in the experiment.[448] Washington privately expressed support for emancipation to prominent
Methodists [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Coke_(bishop)"] Thomas Coke and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Asbury"] Francis Asbury in 1785 but declined to sign their petition.[466] In personal
correspondence the next year, he made clear his desire to see the institution of slavery ended by a gradual
Page 33
legislative process, a view that correlated with the mainstream antislavery literature published in the 1780s
that Washington possessed.[467] He significantly reduced his purchases of slaves after the war but
continued to acquire them in small numbers.[468]
In 1788, Washington declined a suggestion from a leading French
abolitionist, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Pierre_Brissot"] Jacques Brissot, to establish an abolitionist society in
Virginia, stating that although he supported the idea, the time was not yet
right to confront the issue.[469] The historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wiencek"] Henry Wiencek (2003)
believes, based on a remark that appears in the notebook of his biographer
 David Humphreys, that Washington considered making a public
statement by freeing his slaves on the eve of his presidency in 1789.[470]
The historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_D._Morgan"] Philip D. Morgan (2005) disagrees, believing the remark
was a "private expression of remorse" at his inability to free his
slaves.[471] Other historians agree with Morgan that Washington was
In 1794, Washington privately
expressed to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Lear"] Tobias Lear, his
secretary, that he found

slavery.[472] Washington never responded to any of the antislavery
petitions he received, and the subject was not mentioned in either his last
address to Congress or his Farewell Address.[473]
slavery to be repugnant. The first clear indication that Washington seriously intended to free his
slaves appears in a letter written to his secretary, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Lear"] Tobias Lear, in
1794.[474] Washington instructed Lear to find buyers for his land in
western Virginia, explaining in a private coda that he was doing so "to liberate a certain species of property
which I possess, very repugnantly to my own feelings".[475] The plan, along with others Washington
considered in 1795 and 1796, could not be realized because he failed to find buyers for his land, his
reluctance to break up slave families, and the refusal of the Custis heirs to help prevent such separations by
freeing their dower slaves at the same time.[476]
On July 9, 1799, Washington finished making his last will; the longest provision concerned slavery. All his
slaves were to be freed after the death of his wife, Martha. Washington said he did not free them
immediately because his slaves intermarried with his wife's dower slaves. He forbade their sale or
transportation out of Virginia. His will provided that old and young freed people be taken care of
indefinitely; younger ones were to be taught to read and write and placed in suitable occupations.[477]
Washington freed more than 160 slaves, including about 25 he had acquired from his wife's brother
 Bartholomew Dandridge in payment of a debt.[478] He was among the few large slave-holding Virginians
during the Revolutionary Era who emancipated their slaves.[479]
On January 1, 1801, one year after George Washington's death, Martha Washington signed an order to free
his slaves. Many of them, having never strayed far from Mount Vernon, were naturally reluctant to try their
luck elsewhere; others refused to abandon spouses or children still held as dower slaves (the Custis
estate)[480] and also stayed with or near Martha. Following George Washington's instructions in his will,
funds were used to feed and clothe the young, aged, and infirm slaves until the early 1830s.[481]
Historical reputation and legacy
Washington's legacy endures as one of the most influential in American history since he served as
 commander-in-chief of the Continental Army, a hero of the Revolution, and the first president of the United
States. Various historians maintain that he also was a dominant factor in America's founding, the
 Revolutionary War, and the Constitutional Convention.[482] Revolutionary War comrade Light-Horse
Harry Lee [URL: "https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Father_of_His_Country"] eulogized him as "First in war—first in peace—and first in the hearts of his countrymen".[483]
Lee's words became the hallmark by which Washington's reputation was impressed upon the American
Page 34
memory, with some biographers regarding him as the great exemplar of
republicanism. He set many precedents for the national government and
the presidency in particular, and he was called the "Father of His
Country" as early as 1778.[484][t]
In 1879, Congress proclaimed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents%27_Day"] Washington's Birthday to be a federal
holiday.[486] Twentieth-century biographer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Southall_Freeman"] Douglas Southall Freeman
concluded, "The great big thing stamped across that man is character."
Modern historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hackett_Fischer"] David Hackett Fischer has expanded upon Freeman's
assessment, defining Washington's character as "integrity, self-discipline,
courage, absolute honesty, resolve, and decision, but also forbearance,
decency, and respect for others".[487]
Washington became an international symbol for liberation and nationalism
as the leader of the first successful revolution against a colonial empire.

The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party"] Federalists made him the symbol of their party, but the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party"] Jeffersonians

a member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences"] American Academy of Arts and Sciences on
January 31, 1781, before he had even begun his presidency.[489]
He was posthumously appointed to the grade of General of the
Armies of the United States during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bicentennial"] United States Bicentennial
to ensure he would never be outranked; this was accomplished by
the congressional joint resolution [URL: "https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Public_Law_94-479"] Public Law 94-479 passed on
January 19, 1976, with an effective appointment date of July 4,

promoted to the rank of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_of_the_Armies_of_the_United_States"] General of the Armies.[493]  A drawing from a Japanese

attempted to humanize Washington, making him look less stern,
and to inspire "patriotism and morality" and to foster "enduring myths", such as Washington's refusal to lie
about damaging his father's cherry tree.[495] Weems' accounts have never been proven or disproven.[496]
Historian John Ferling, however, maintains that Washington remains the only founder and president ever to
be referred to as "godlike", and points out that his character has been the most scrutinized by historians,
past and present.[497] Historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_S._Wood"] Gordon S. Wood concludes that "the greatest act of his life, the one that
gave him his greatest fame, was his resignation as commander-in-chief of the American forces."[498]
Chernow suggests that Washington was "burdened by public life" and divided by "unacknowledged
ambition mingled with self-doubt".[499] A 1993 review of presidential polls and surveys consistently
ranked Washington number 4, 3, or 2 among presidents.[500] A 2018 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_College_Research_Institute"] Siena College Research Institute
survey ranked him number 1 among presidents.[501]
In the 21st century, Washington's reputation has been critically scrutinized. Along with various other
Founding Fathers, he has been condemned for holding enslaved human beings. Though he expressed the
desire to see the abolition of slavery come through legislation, he did not initiate or support any initiatives
for bringing about its end. This has led to calls from some activists to remove his name from public
buildings and his statue from public spaces.[502][503] Nonetheless, Washington maintains his place among
the highest-ranked U.S. Presidents, listed second (after Lincoln) in a 2021 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-SPAN"] C-SPAN poll.[504]

multiple doses of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury(I)_chloride"] calomel (a cathartic or purgative) and extensive bloodletting.
s. The Constitution came under attack in Pennsylvania, and Washington wrote to Richard
Peters, "It would seem from the public Gazettes that the minority in your State are preparing
for another attack of the now adopted Government; how formidable it may be, I know not. But
that Providence which has hitherto smiled on the honest endeavours of the well meaning
part of the People of this Country will not, I trust, withdraw its support from them at this
crisis."[420]
t. The earliest known image in which Washington is identified as the Father of His Country is
 in the frontispiece of a 1779 German-language almanac, with calculations by David
Rittenhouse and published by Francis Bailey in Lancaster County Pennsylvania. Der Gantz
Neue Verbesserte Nord-Americanische Calendar has a personification of Fame holding a
trumpet to her lips juxtaposed with an image of Washington and the words "Der Landes
Vater" ("the father of the country" or "the father of the land").[485]
u. In Portraits & Biographical Sketches of the United States Army's Senior Officer,[491] William
Gardner Bell states that Washington was recalled to military service from his retirement in
1798, and "Congress passed legislation that would have made him General of the Armies of
the United States, but his services were not required in the field, and the appointment was
not made until the Bicentennial in 1976 when it was bestowed posthumously as a
commemorative honor." In 1976, President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford"] Gerald Ford specified that Washington would
"rank first among all officers of the Army, past and present".[492]
