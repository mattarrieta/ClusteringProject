John Adams
John Adams (October 30, 1735[a] – July 4, 1826) was an
 American statesman, attorney, diplomat, writer, and Founding
Father who served as the 2nd [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"] president of the United States from
1797 to 1801. Before [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_John_Adams"] his presidency, he was a leader of the
 American Revolution that achieved independence from Great
Britain and during the war, served as a diplomat in Europe. He
was twice elected [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president_of_the_United_States"] vice president of the United States, serving
from 1789 to 1797 in a prestigious role with little power. Adams
was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with many
 important contemporaries, including his wife and adviser Abigail
Adams as well as his friend and rival [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"] Thomas Jefferson. 
John Adams
A lawyer and political activist prior to the Revolution, Adams
 was devoted to the right to counsel and presumption of
innocence. He defied anti-British sentiment and successfully
defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the
 Boston Massacre. Adams was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_Massachusetts_Bay"] Massachusetts delegate to the
 Continental Congress and became a leader of the revolution. He
assisted Jefferson in drafting the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence"] Declaration of Independence in
 1776. As a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate a peace
treaty with Great Britain and secured vital governmental loans.
Adams was the primary author of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Constitution"] Massachusetts Constitution
in 1780, which influenced the United States constitution, as did
his essay [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughts_on_Government"] Thoughts on Government.
Adams was elected to two terms as vice president under
President George Washington and was elected as the United
States' second president in 1796. He was the only president
elected under the banner of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party"] Federalist Party. During his
single term, Adams encountered fierce criticism from the
 Jeffersonian Republicans and from some in his own Federalist
Party, led by his rival [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton. Adams signed the
controversial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts"] Alien and Sedition Acts and built up the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army"] Army and
 Navy in the undeclared naval war (called the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-War"] Quasi-War") with
France. During his term, he became the first president to reside
in the executive mansion now known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"] White House.
In his bid for reelection, opposition from Federalists and
accusations of despotism from Jeffersonians led to Adams losing
to his vice president and former friend Jefferson, and he retired
to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed his friendship with
Jefferson by initiating a correspondence that lasted fourteen
years. He and his wife generated a family of politicians,
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_political_family"] diplomats, and historians now referred to as the Adams political
family, which includes their son [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams"] John Quincy Adams, the sixth
president of the United States. John Adams died on July 4, 1826

Childhood
 Adams's birthplace now in Quincy,
Massachusetts
England, around 1638.[7] 
John Adams was born on October 30, 1735 (October 19, 1735,
 Old Style, Julian calendar),  to John Adams Sr. and Susanna
Boylston. He had two younger brothers: Peter (1738–1823) and
 Elihu (1741–1775).[5] Adams was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_Birthplace"] born on the family farm in
Braintree, Massachusetts.[6][b] His mother was from a leading
medical family of present-day [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookline,_Massachusetts"] Brookline, Massachusetts. His father
was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deacon"] deacon in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregationalism_in_the_United_States"] Congregational Church, a farmer, a
cordwainer, and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant"] lieutenant in the militia.[7] John Sr. served as a
 selectman (town councilman) and supervised the building of
schools and roads. Adams often praised his father and recalled their
 close relationship.[8] Adams's  great-great-grandfather Henry
Adams immigrated to Massachusetts from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braintree,_Essex"] Braintree, Essex,
Though raised in modest surroundings, Adams felt pressured to live up to his heritage. His family was
descended from Puritans, whose strict religious doctrines had profoundly shaped New England's culture,
laws, and traditions. By the time of John Adams's birth, Puritan tenets such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predestination"] predestination had waned
and many of their severe practices moderated, but Adams still "considered them bearers of freedom, a cause
that still had a holy urgency".[9] Adams recalled that his parents "held every Species of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertine"] Libertinage in ...
Contempt and horror", and detailed "pictures of disgrace, or baseness and of Ruin" resulting from any
Page 4
debauchery.[5] Adams later noted that "As a child I enjoyed perhaps the greatest of blessings that can be
bestowed upon men – that of a mother who was anxious and capable to form the characters of her
children."[10]
 Adams, as the eldest child, was compelled to obtain a formal education. This began at age six at a dame
school for boys and girls, conducted at a teacher's home, and was centered upon [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Primer"] The New England Primer.
Shortly thereafter, Adams attended Braintree Latin School under Joseph Cleverly, where studies included
Latin, rhetoric, logic, and arithmetic. Adams's early education included incidents of truancy, a dislike for his
master, and a desire to become a farmer. All discussion on the matter ended with his father's command that
he remain in school: "You shall comply with my desires." Deacon Adams hired a new schoolmaster named
Joseph Marsh, and his son responded positively.[11]
College education and adulthood
At age sixteen, Adams entered [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College"] Harvard College in 1751, studying under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Mayhew"] Joseph Mayhew.[12] As an adult,
Adams was a keen scholar, studying the works of ancient writers such as Thucydides, Plato, Cicero, and
 Tacitus in their original languages.[13] Though his father expected him to be a minister,[14] after his 1755
graduation with an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Arts"] A.B. degree, he taught school temporarily in Worcester, while pondering his permanent
vocation. In the next four years, he began to seek prestige, craving "Honour or Reputation" and "more
defference from [his] fellows", and was determined to be "a great Man". He decided to become a lawyer to
further those ends, writing his father that he found among lawyers "noble and gallant achievements" but,
among the clergy, the "pretended sanctity of some absolute dunces". His aspirations conflicted with his
Puritanism, though, prompting reservations about his self-described "trumpery" and failure to share the
"happiness of [his] fellow men".[15]
As the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War"] French and Indian War began in 1754, Adams, aged nineteen, began to struggle with his
responsibility in the conflict as many of his contemporaries joined the war for money. Adams later said, "I
longed more ardently to be a Soldier than I ever did to be a Lawyer", recognizing that he was the first of his
family to "[degenerate] from the virtues of the house so far as not to have been an officer in the militia".[16]
Law practice and marriage
In 1756, Adams began [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_law"] reading law under
James Putnam, a  leading lawyer in
Worcester.[17] In 1758, he earned an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts"] A.M. from
Harvard,[18] and in 1759 was admitted to the
bar.[19] He developed an early habit of writing
about events and impressions of men in his
diary; this included [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Otis_Jr."] James Otis Jr.'s 1761 legal
argument challenging the legality of British
 writs of assistance, allowing the British to
search a home without notice or reason. Otis's
argument inspired Adams to the cause of the
 American colonies.[20] 
 Abigail Smith Adams – 1766 John Adams – 1766 portrait
A group of Boston businessmen had been 
portrait by Benjamin Blyth also by Blyth
appalled at the writs of assistance that the
crown had started issuing to clamp down on colonial smuggling. Writs of assistance were not only search
warrants without any limits, they also required local sheriffs, and even local citizens, to assist in breaking
into colonists' houses or lend whatever assistance customs officials desired.[21][22][23] The outraged
Page 5
businessmen engaged lawyer James Otis Jr. to challenge writs of assistance in court. Otis gave the speech
of his life, making references to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_Carta"] Magna Carta, classical allusions, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_law"] natural law, and the colonists' "rights
as Englishmen".[21][24][25][23]
The court ruled against the merchants. However, the case lit the fire that became the American Revolution.
Otis's arguments were published in the colonies, and stirred widespread support for colonial rights. As a
young lawyer, John Adams was observing the case in the packed courtroom, and was moved by Otis's
performance and legal arguments. Adams later said that "Then and there the child Independence was
born."[26][25][23][27]
In 1763, Adams explored various aspects of political theory in seven essays written for Boston newspapers.
He offered them anonymously, under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nom_de_plume"] nom de plume "Humphrey Ploughjogger", and in them ridiculed
the selfish thirst for power he perceived among the Massachusetts colonial elite.[28] Adams was initially
less well known than his older cousin [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Adams"] Samuel Adams, but his influence emerged from his work as a
constitutional lawyer, his analysis of history, and his dedication to republicanism. Adams often found his
own irascible nature a constraint in his political career.[14]
In the late 1750s, Adams fell in love with Hannah Quincy; while they were alone, he was poised to
 propose but was interrupted by friends, and the moment was lost. In 1759, he met 15-year-old Abigail
Smith, his third cousin,[29] through his friend Richard Cranch, who was courting Abigail's older sister.
Adams initially was not impressed with Abigail and her two sisters, writing that they were not "fond, nor
frank, nor candid".[30] In time, he grew close to Abigail and they were married on October 25, 1764,
despite the opposition of Abigail's haughty mother. They shared a love of books and kindred personalities
that proved honest in their praise and criticism of each other. After his father's death in 1761, Adams had
inherited a 91⁄2-acre (3.8 ha) farm and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams_Birthplace"] a house where they lived until 1783.[31][32] John and Abigail had six
children: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail_Adams_Smith"] Abigail "Nabby" in 1765,[33] future president [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams"] John Quincy Adams in 1767,[34] Susanna in 1768,
 Charles in 1770, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Boylston_Adams_(1772%E2%80%931832)"] Thomas in 1772,[35] and Elizabeth in 1777.[36] Susanna died when she was one year
old,[35] while Elizabeth was stillborn.[36] All three of his sons became lawyers. Charles and Thomas were
unsuccessful, became alcoholics, and died before old age, while John Quincy excelled and launched a
career in politics. Adams's writings are devoid of his feelings about the sons' fates.[37]
Career before the Revolution
Opponent of Stamp Act
Adams rose to prominence leading widespread opposition to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_Act_1765"] Stamp Act of 1765. The Act was imposed
by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain"] British Parliament without consulting the American legislatures. It required payment of a direct tax
by the colonies for stamped documents,[38][39] and was designed to pay for the costs of Britain's war with
France. Power of enforcement was given to British [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_admiralty_court"] vice admiralty courts, rather than [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law"] common law
courts.[40][39] These Admiralty courts acted without juries and were greatly disliked.[38] The Act was
despised for both its monetary cost and implementation without colonial consent, and encountered violent
resistance, preventing its enforcement.[40] Adams authored the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braintree_Instructions"] Braintree Instructions" in 1765, in the form
of a letter sent to the representatives of Braintree in the Massachusetts legislature. In it, he explained that the
Act should be opposed since it denied two fundamental rights guaranteed to all Englishmen (and which all
free men deserved): rights to be taxed only by consent and to be tried by a jury of one's peers. The
instructions were a succinct and forthright defense of colonial rights and liberties, and served as a model for
other towns' instructions.[41]
Page 6
Adams also reprised his pen name "Humphrey Ploughjogger" in opposition to the Stamp Act in August of
that year. Included were four articles to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Gazette"] Boston Gazette. The articles were republished in The London
Chronicle in 1768 as True Sentiments of America, also known as A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal
Law. He also spoke in December before the governor and council, pronouncing the Stamp Act invalid in
the absence of Massachusetts representation at Parliament.[42][43] He noted that many protests were
sparked by a popular sermon of Boston minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Mayhew"] Jonathan Mayhew, invoking [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_to_the_Romans"] Romans 13 to justify
insurrection.[44] While Adams took a strong stand against the Act in writing, he rebuffed attempts by
Samuel Adams, a leader in the popular protest movements, to involve him in mob actions and public
demonstrations.[45] In 1766, a town meeting of Braintree elected Adams as a selectman.[46]
With the repeal of the Stamp Act in early 1766, tensions with Britain temporarily eased.[47] Putting politics
aside, Adams moved his family to Boston in April 1768 to focus on his law practice. The family rented a
clapboard house on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brattle_Street_(Boston)"] Brattle Street that was known locally as the "White House". He, Abigail, and the
children lived there for a year, then moved to Cold Lane; still, later, they moved again to a larger house in
Brattle Square in the center of the city.[34] With the death of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Gridley"] Jeremiah Gridley and the mental collapse of
Otis, Adams became Boston's most prominent lawyer.[46]
Counsel for the British: Boston Massacre
Britain's passage of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townshend_Acts"] Townshend Acts in 1767 revived tensions,
and an increase in mob violence led the British to dispatch more
troops to the colonies.[48] On March 5, 1770, when a lone British
sentry was accosted by a mob of citizens, eight of his fellow
 soldiers reinforced him, and the crowd around them grew to several
hundred. The soldiers were struck with snowballs, ice, and stones,
and in the chaos the soldiers opened fire, killing five civilians,
bringing about the infamous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Massacre"] Boston Massacre. The accused
soldiers were arrested on charges of murder. When no other
attorneys would come to their defense, Adams was impelled to do
so despite the risk to his reputation – he believed no person should
be denied the right to counsel and a fair trial. The trials were
delayed so that passions could cool.[49] 
Boston Massacre of 1770 by Alonzo
Chappel
The week-long trial of the commander, Captain [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Preston_(British_Army_officer)"] Thomas Preston, began on October 24 and ended in his
acquittal, because it was impossible to prove that he had ordered his soldiers to fire.[50] The remaining
soldiers were tried in December when Adams made his legendary argument regarding jury decisions:
"Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion,
they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence."[51] He added, "It is more important that innocence be
protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot
all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen
will say, 'whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,' and if
such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security
whatsoever." Adams won an acquittal for six of the soldiers. Two, who had fired directly into the crowd,
were convicted of manslaughter. Adams was paid a small sum by his clients.[31]
According to biographer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Ferling"] John E. Ferling, during [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voir_dire"] jury selection Adams "expertly exercised his right to
challenge individual jurors and contrived what amounted to a packed jury. Not only were several jurors
closely tied through business arrangements to the British army, but five ultimately became Loyalist exiles."
While Adams's defence was helped by a weak prosecution, he also "performed brilliantly."[52] Ferling
Page 7
surmises that Adams was encouraged to take the case in exchange for political office; one of Boston's seats
opened three months later in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_General_Court"] Massachusetts legislature, and Adams was the town's first choice to fill the
vacancy.[53]
The prosperity of his law practice increased from this exposure, as did the demands on his time. In 1771,
Adams moved his family to Braintree but kept his office in Boston. He noted on the day of the family's
move, "Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my
Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning – I am in it at 9 at night. ... In the Evening, I can be alone at my
Office, and no where else." After some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and
"vulgar" Braintree as a home for his family – in August 1772, he moved them back to Boston. He
purchased a large brick house on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_Street_(Boston)"] Queen Street, not far from his office.[54] In 1774, Adams and Abigail
returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained
their permanent Massachusetts home.[55]
Becoming a revolutionary
Adams, who had been among the more conservative of the Founders, persistently held that while British
actions against the colonies had been wrong and misguided, open insurrection was unwarranted and
peaceful petition with the ultimate view of remaining part of Great Britain was a better alternative.[56] His
ideas began to change around 1772, as the British Crown assumed payment of the salaries of Governor
 Thomas Hutchinson and his judges instead of the Massachusetts legislature. Adams wrote in the Gazette
that these measures would destroy judicial independence and place the colonial government in closer
subjugation to the Crown. After discontent among members of the legislature, Hutchinson delivered a
speech warning that Parliament's powers over the colonies were absolute and that any resistance was
 illegal. Subsequently, John Adams, Samuel, and Joseph Hawley drafted a resolution adopted by the House
of Representatives threatening independence as an alternative to tyranny. The resolution argued that the
colonists had never been under the sovereignty of Parliament. Their original charter, as well as their
allegiance, was exclusive to the King.[57]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Tea_Party"] Boston Tea Party, a historic demonstration against the British [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company"] East India Company's tea monopoly over
American merchants, took place on December 16, 1773. The British schooner Dartmouth, loaded with tea
to be traded subject to the new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Act"] Tea Act, had previously dropped anchor in Boston harbor. By 9:00 PM, the
work of the protesters was done – they had demolished 342 chests of tea worth about ten thousand pounds.
The Dartmouth owners briefly retained Adams as legal counsel regarding their liability for the destroyed
shipment. Adams applauded the destruction of the tea, calling it the "grandest Event" in the history of the
colonial protest movement,[58] and writing in his diary that the dutied tea's destruction was an "absolutely
and indispensably" necessary action.[59]
Continental Congress
Member of Continental Congress
In 1774, at the instigation of John's cousin [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Adams"] Samuel Adams, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Continental_Congress"] First Continental Congress was convened in
response to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intolerable_Acts"] Intolerable Acts, a series of deeply unpopular measures intended to punish Massachusetts,
centralize authority in Britain, and prevent rebellion in other colonies. Four delegates were chosen by the
Massachusetts legislature, including John Adams, who agreed to attend,[60] despite an emotional plea from
his friend Attorney General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Sewall"] Jonathan Sewall not to.[61]
Page 8
Shortly after he arrived in Philadelphia, Adams was
placed on the 23-member Grand Committee tasked
with drafting a letter of grievances to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom"] King George III.
The members of the committee soon split into
conservative and radical factions.[62] Although the
Massachusetts delegation was largely passive, Adams
criticized conservatives such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Galloway"] Joseph Galloway,
 James Duane, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Oliver_(loyalist)"] Peter Oliver who advocated a
conciliatory policy towards the British or felt that the
colonies had a duty to remain loyal to Britain, although
his views at the time did align with those of
conservative [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dickinson_(Pennsylvania_and_Delaware)"] John Dickinson. Adams sought the repeal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Trumbull"] John Trumbull's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_Independence_(Trumbull)"] Declaration of Independence
of objectionable policies, but at this early stage he
continued to see benefits in maintaining the ties with
Britain.[63] He renewed his push for the right to a jury
trial.[64] He complained of what he considered the 
depicts the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Five"] Committee of Five presenting its draft
to Congress. Adams is depicted in the center with
his hand on his hip.
pretentiousness of the other delegates, writing to
Abigail, "I believe if it was moved and seconded that We should come to a Resolution that Three and two
make five We should be entertained with Logick and Rhetorick, Law, History, Politicks and Mathematicks,
concerning the Subject for two whole Days, and then We should pass the Resolution unanimously in the
Affirmative."[65] Adams ultimately helped engineer a compromise between the conservatives and the
radicals.[66] The Congress disbanded in October after sending the final petition to the King and showing its
displeasure with the Intolerable Acts by endorsing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffolk_Resolves"] Suffolk Resolves.[67]
Adams's absence from home was hard on Abigail, who was left alone to care for the family. She still
encouraged her husband in his task, writing: "You cannot be, I know, nor do I wish to see you an inactive
Spectator, but if the Sword be drawn I bid adieu to all domestick felicity, and look forward to that Country
where there is neither wars nor rumors of War in a firm belief that thro the mercy of its King we shall both
rejoice there together."[68]
News of the opening hostilities with the British at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord"] Battles of Lexington and Concord made Adams hope
that independence would soon become a reality. Three days after the battle, he rode into a militia camp and,
while reflecting positively on the high spirits of the men, was distressed by their poor condition and lack of
discipline.[69] A month later, Adams returned to Philadelphia for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress"] Second Continental Congress as the
leader of the Massachusetts delegation.[70] He moved cautiously at first, noting that the Congress was
divided between Loyalists, those favoring independence, and those hesitant to take any position.[71] He
became convinced that Congress was moving in the proper direction – away from Great Britain. Publicly,
Adams supported "reconciliation if practicable," but privately agreed with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin"] Benjamin Franklin's confidential
observation that independence was inevitable.[72]
In June 1775, with a view of promoting union among the colonies against Great Britain, he nominated
 George Washington of Virginia as commander-in-chief of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army"] army then assembled around Boston.[73] He
praised Washington's "skill and experience" as well as his "excellent universal character."[74] Adams
opposed various attempts, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Branch_Petition"] Olive Branch Petition, aimed at trying to find peace between the
colonies and Great Britain.[75] Invoking the already-long list of British actions against the colonies, he
wrote, "In my opinion Powder and Artillery are the most efficacious, Sure, and infallibly conciliatory
Measures We can adopt."[76] After his failure to prevent the petition from being enacted, he wrote a private
letter derisively referring to Dickinson as a "piddling genius." The letter was intercepted and published in
Loyalist newspapers. The well-respected Dickinson refused to greet Adams and he was for a time largely
ostracized.[77] Ferling writes, "By the fall of 1775 no one in Congress labored more ardently than Adams
to hasten the day when America would be separate from Great Britain."[72] In October 1775, Adams was
Page 9
appointed the chief judge of the Massachusetts Superior Court, but he never served, and resigned in
 February 1777.[73] In response to queries from other delegates, Adams wrote the 1776 pamphlet Thoughts
on Government, which laid out an influential framework for republican constitutions.[78]
Independence
Throughout the first half of 1776, Adams grew increasingly impatient with what he perceived to be the
slow pace of declaring independence.[79] He kept busy on the floor of the Congress, helping push through
a plan to outfit armed ships to launch raids on enemy vessels. Later in the year, he drafted the first set of
regulations to govern the provisional navy.[80] Adams drafted the preamble to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_resolution"] Lee resolution of
colleague [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Henry_Lee"] Richard Henry Lee.[81] He developed a rapport with Delegate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"] Thomas Jefferson of Virginia,
who had been slower to support independence but by early 1776 agreed that it was necessary.[82] On June
7, 1776, Adams [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_(parliamentary_procedure)"] seconded the Lee resolution, which stated, "These colonies are, and of right ought to be,
free and independent states."[83] 
Prior to independence being declared, Adams organized and
selected a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Five"] Committee of Five charged with drafting a
 Declaration of Independence. He chose himself, Jefferson,
 Benjamin Franklin, Robert R. Livingston and Roger
Sherman.[84] Jefferson thought Adams should write the
document, but Adams persuaded the committee to choose
Jefferson. Many years later, Adams recorded his exchange with
Jefferson: Jefferson asked, "Why will you not? You ought to do
it." To which Adams responded, "I will not – reasons enough."
The Assembly Room in Philadelphia's  Jefferson replied, "What can be your reasons?" and Adams
 Independence Hall, where the Second responded, "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian
Continental Congress adopted the  ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason second, I
Declaration of Independence am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much
otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I
can." "Well," said Jefferson, "if you are decided, I will do as
well as I can."[85] The Committee left no minutes, and the drafting process itself remains uncertain.
Accounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, although frequently cited, are often
contradictory.[86] Although the first draft was written primarily by Jefferson, Adams assumed a major role
in its completion.[87] On July 1, the resolution was debated in Congress. It was expected to pass, but
opponents such as Dickinson made a strong effort to oppose it anyhow. Jefferson, a poor debater, remained
silent while Adams argued for its adoption.[88] Many years later, Jefferson hailed Adams as "the pillar of
[the Declaration's] support on the floor of Congress, [its] ablest advocate and defender against the
multifarious assaults it encountered."[89] After editing the document further, Congress approved it on July
2. Twelve colonies voted in the affirmative, while New York abstained. Dickinson was absent.[90] On July
3, Adams wrote to Abigail that "yesterday was decided the greatest question which was ever debated in
America, and a greater perhaps never was nor will be decided among men." He predicted that "[t]he
second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epoch in the history of America," and would be
commemorated annually with great festivities.[91]
During the congress, Adams sat on ninety committees, chairing twenty-five, an unmatched workload
among the congressmen. As [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Rush"] Benjamin Rush reported, he was acknowledged "to be the first man in the
House."[92] In June, Adams became head of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_War_and_Ordnance"] Board of War and Ordnance, charged with keeping an
accurate record of the officers in the army and their ranks, the disposition of troops throughout the colonies,
and ammunition.[93] He was referred to as a "one man war department," working up to eighteen-hour days
and mastering the details of raising, equipping and fielding an army under civilian control.[94] As chairman
Page 10
of the Board, Adams functioned as a de facto Secretary of War. He kept extensive correspondences with a
wide range of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army"] Continental Army officers concerning supplies, munitions, and tactics. Adams emphasized to
them the role of discipline in keeping an army orderly.[95] He also authored the "Plan of Treaties," laying
out the Congress's requirements for a treaty with France.[94] He was worn out by the rigor of his duties and
longed to return home. His finances were unsteady, and the money that he received as a delegate failed
even to cover his own necessary expenses. However, the crisis caused by the defeat of the American
soldiers kept him at his post.[96]
 After defeating the Continental Army at the Battle of Long Island on August 27, British Admiral Richard
Howe determined that a strategic advantage was at hand, and requested that Congress send representatives
to negotiate peace. A delegation consisting of Adams, Franklin, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Rutledge"] Edward Rutledge met with Howe at
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staten_Island_Peace_Conference"] Staten Island Peace Conference on September 11.[97][98] Howe's authority was premised on the states'
submission, so the parties found no common ground. When Lord Howe stated he could view the American
delegates only as British subjects, Adams replied, "Your lordship may consider me in what light you please,
... except that of a British subject."[99] Adams learned many years later that his name was on a list of people
specifically excluded from Howe's pardon-granting authority.[100] Adams was unimpressed with Howe
and predicted American success.[101] He was able to return home to Braintree in October before leaving in
January 1777 to resume his duties in Congress.[102]
Diplomatic service
Commissioner to France
Adams advocated in Congress that independence was necessary to establish trade, and conversely, trade
was essential for the attainment of independence; he specifically urged negotiation of a commercial treaty
with France. He was then appointed, along with Franklin, Dickinson, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison_V"] Benjamin Harrison of Virginia and
Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, "to prepare a plan of treaties to be proposed to foreign powers." While
Jefferson was laboring over the Declaration of Independence, Adams worked on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_Treaty"] Model Treaty. The
Model Treaty authorized a commercial agreement with France but contained no provisions for formal
recognition or military assistance. There were provisions for what constituted French territory. The treaty
adhered to the provision that "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_navigation"] free ships make free goods," allowing neutral nations to trade reciprocally
while exempting an agreed-upon list of contraband. By late 1777, America's finances were in tatters, and
that September a British army had [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Brandywine"] defeated General Washington and captured Philadelphia. More
Americans came to determine that mere commercial ties between the U.S. and France would not be
enough, and that military assistance would be needed to end the war. The defeat of the British at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Saratoga"] Saratoga
was expected to help induce France to agree to an alliance.[103]
In November, Adams learned that he was to be named commissioner to France, replacing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silas_Deane"] Silas Deane and
joining Franklin and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Lee_(diplomat)"] Arthur Lee in Paris to negotiate an alliance with the hesitant French. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lovell_(Continental_Congress)"] James Lovell
invoked Adams's "inflexible integrity" and the need to have a youthful man who could counterbalance
Franklin's advanced age. On November 27, Adams accepted, wasting no time. He wrote to Lovell that he
"should have wanted no motives or arguments" for his acceptance if he "could be sure that the public
would be benefited by it." Abigail was left in Massachusetts to manage their home, but it was agreed that
10-year-old John Quincy would go with Adams, for the experience was "of inestimable value" to his
 maturation.[104] On February 17, Adams set sail aboard the frigate Boston, commanded by Captain Samuel
Tucker.[105] The trip was stormy and treacherous. Lightning injured 19 sailors and killed one. The ship was
pursued by several British vessels, with Adams taking up arms to help capture one. A cannon malfunction
killed one of the crew and injured five others. On April 1, the Boston arrived in France, where Adams
learned that France had agreed to an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Alliance_(1778)"] alliance with the United States on February 6.[106] Adams was
annoyed by the other two commissioners: Lee, whom he thought paranoid and cynical, and the popular and
Page 11
influential Franklin, whom he found lethargic and overly deferential and accommodating to the
French.[107] He assumed a less visible role but helped manage the delegation's finances and record-
keeping.[108] Frustrated by the perceived lack of commitment on the part of the French, Adams wrote a
letter to French foreign minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Gravier,_comte_de_Vergennes"] Vergennes in December, arguing for French naval support in North
America. Franklin toned down the letter, but Vergennes still ignored it.[109] In September 1778, Congress
increased Franklin's powers by naming him [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_plenipotentiary"] minister plenipotentiary to France while Lee was sent to Spain.
Adams received no instructions. Frustrated by the apparent slight, he departed France with his son John
Quincy on March 8, 1779.[110] On August 2, they arrived in Braintree.[111]
In late 1779, Adams was appointed as the sole minister charged with
negotiations to establish a commercial treaty with Britain and end the
war.[112] Following the conclusion of the Massachusetts constitutional
convention, he departed for France in November[113] aboard the
French frigate Sensible – accompanied by his sons John Quincy and 9-
 year-old Charles.[114] A leak in the ship forced it to land in Ferrol,
Spain, and Adams and his party spent six weeks travelling overland
until they reached Paris.[115] Constant disagreement between Lee and
Franklin eventually resulted in Adams assuming the role of tie-breaker
in almost all votes on commission business. He increased his
usefulness by mastering the French language. Lee was eventually
recalled. Adams closely supervised his sons' education while writing
to Abigail about once every ten days.[116]
Adams frequently clashed with
 Benjamin Franklin over how to
manage French relations. 
In contrast to Franklin, Adams viewed the Franco-American alliance
pessimistically. The French, he believed, were involved for their own
self-interest, and he grew frustrated by what he saw as their
sluggishness in providing substantial aid to the Revolution. The
French, Adams wrote, meant to keep their hands "above our chin to prevent us from drowning, but not to
lift our heads out of water."[117] In March 1780, Congress, trying to curb inflation, voted to devalue the
dollar. Vergennes summoned Adams for a meeting. In a letter sent in June, he insisted that any fluctuation
of the dollar value without an exception for French merchants was unacceptable and requested that Adams
write to Congress asking it to "retrace its steps." Adams bluntly defended the decision, not only claiming
that the French merchants were doing better than Vergennes implied but voicing other grievances he had
with the French. The alliance had been made over two years before. During that period, an army under the
 comte de Rochambeau had been sent to assist Washington, but it had yet to do anything of significance and
America was expecting French warships. These were needed, Adams wrote, to contain the British armies
in the port cities and contend with the powerful British Navy. However, the French Navy had been sent not
to the United States but to the West Indies to protect French interests there. France, Adams believed,
needed to commit itself more fully to the alliance. Vergennes responded that he would deal only with
Franklin, who sent a letter back to Congress critical of Adams.[118] Adams then left France of his own
accord.[119]
Ambassador to the Dutch Republic
In mid-1780, Adams traveled to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Republic"] Dutch Republic. One of the few other existing republics at the time,
Adams thought it might be sympathetic to the American cause. Securing a Dutch loan could increase
American independence from France and pressure Britain into peace. At first, Adams had no official status,
but in July he was formally given permission to negotiate for a loan and took up residence in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam"] Amsterdam in
August. Adams was originally optimistic and greatly enjoyed the city, but soon became disappointed. The
Dutch, fearing British retaliation, refused to meet Adams. Before he had arrived, the British found out
about secret aid the Dutch had sent to the Americans, the British authorized reprisals against their ships,
Page 12
which only increased their apprehension. Word had also reached Europe of American battlefield defeats.
After five months of not meeting with a single Dutch official, Adams in early 1781 pronounced Amsterdam
"the capital of the reign of Mammon."[120] He was finally invited to present his credentials as ambassador
to the Dutch government at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague"] The Hague on April 19, 1781, but they did not promise any assistance. In the
meantime, Adams thwarted an attempt by neutral European powers to mediate the war without consulting
the United States.[121] In July, Adams consented to the departure of both of his sons; John Quincy went
with Adams's secretary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Dana"] Francis Dana to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg"] Saint Petersburg as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language"] French interpreter, in an effort to seek
 recognition from Russia, and a homesick Charles returned home with Adams's friend Benjamin
Waterhouse.[122] In August, shortly after being removed from his position of sole head of peace treaty
negotiations, Adams fell seriously ill in "a major nervous breakdown."[123] That November, he learned that
American and French troops had decisively defeated the British at Yorktown. The victory was in large part
due to the assistance of the French Navy, which vindicated Adams's stand for increased naval
assistance.[124]
News of the American triumph at Yorktown convulsed Europe. In January 1782, after recovering, Adams
arrived at The Hague to demand that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_General_of_the_Netherlands"] States General of the Netherlands answer his petitions. His efforts
stalled, and he took his cause to the people, successfully capitalizing on popular pro-American sentiment to
push the States General towards recognizing the U.S. Several provinces began recognizing American
independence. On April 19, the States General in The Hague formally recognized American independence
and acknowledged Adams as ambassador.[125] On June 11, with the aid of the Dutch [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriottentijd"] Patriotten leader
 Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol, Adams negotiated a loan of five million guilders. In October, he
negotiated with the Dutch a treaty of amity and commerce.[126] The house that Adams bought during this
stay in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"] Netherlands became the first American embassy on foreign soil.[127]
Treaty of Paris
After negotiating the loan with the Dutch, Adams was re-
appointed as the American commissioner to negotiate the
war-ending treaty, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)"] Treaty of Paris. Vergennes and
 France's minister to the United States, Anne-César de La
Luzerne, disapproved of Adams, so Franklin, Thomas
Jefferson, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay"] John Jay, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Laurens"] Henry Laurens were appointed
to collaborate with Adams, although Jefferson did not
initially go to Europe and Laurens was posted to the
Dutch Republic following his imprisonment in the Tower
of London.[128]
In the final negotiations, securing fishing rights off
 Newfoundland and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Breton_Island"] Cape Breton Island proved both very
important and very difficult. In response to very strict 
 Treaty of Paris by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_West"] Benjamin West (Adams in
front).
restrictions proposed by the British, Adams insisted that
not only should American fishermen be allowed to travel as close to shore as desired, but that they should
be allowed to cure their fish on the shores of Newfoundland.[129] This, and other statements, prompted
Vergennes to secretly inform the British that France did not feel compelled to "sustain [these] pretentious
ambitions." Overruling Franklin and distrustful of Vergennes, Jay and Adams decided not to consult with
France, instead dealing directly with the British.[130] During these negotiations, Adams mentioned to the
British that his proposed fishing terms were more generous than those offered by France in 1778 and that
accepting would foster goodwill between Britain and the United States while putting pressure on France.
Britain agreed, and the two sides worked out other provisions afterward. Vergennes was angered when he
learned from Franklin of the American duplicity, but did not demand renegotiation. He was surprised at
how much the Americans could extract. The independent negotiations allowed the French to plead
Page 13
innocence to their Spanish allies, whose demands for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibraltar"] Gibraltar might have caused significant
problems.[131] On September 3, 1783, the treaty was signed and American independence was
recognized.[132]
Ambassador to Great Britain
Adams was appointed the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ambassadors_of_the_United_States_to_the_United_Kingdom"] American ambassador to Great Britain in 1785. When a counterpart
assumed that Adams had family in England, Adams replied, "Neither my father or mother, grandfather or
grandmother, great grandfather or great grandmother, nor any other relation that I know of, or care a
farthing for, has been in England these one hundred and fifty years; so that you see I have not one drop of
blood in my veins but what is American."[133]
Adams – 1785 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mather_Brown"] Mather Brown Portrait 
After arriving in London from Paris, Adams had his first audience
with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_George_III"] King George III on June 1, which he meticulously recorded in
a letter to Foreign Minister Jay the next day. The pair's exchange
was respectful; Adams promised to do all that he could to restore
friendship and cordiality "between People who, tho Seperated [[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic"] sic]
by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same
Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood," and the King
agreed to "receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly
Dispositions of the United States." The King added that although
"he had been the last to consent" to American independence, he
wanted Adams to know that he had always done what he thought
was right. Towards its end, he startled Adams by commenting that
"There is an Opinion, among Some People, that you are not the
most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France."
Adams replied, "That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to
your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country." To
this King George responded, "An honest Man will never have any
other."[134]
Adams was joined by Abigail while in London. Suffering the hostility of the King's courtiers, they escaped
when they could by seeking out [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Price"] Richard Price, minister of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newington_Green_Unitarian_Church"] Newington Green Unitarian Church and
instigator of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_Controversy"] debate over the Revolution within Britain.[135] Adams corresponded with his sons John
Quincy and Charles, both of whom were at Harvard, cautioning the former against the "smell of the
midnight lamp" while admonishing the latter to devote sufficient time to study.[136] Jefferson visited Adams
in 1786 while serving as Minister to France; the two toured the countryside and saw many British historical
sites.[137] While in London, he briefly met his old friend [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Sewall"] Jonathan Sewall, but the two discovered that they
had grown too far apart to renew their friendship. Adams considered Sewall one of the war's casualties, and
Sewall critiqued him as an ambassador:
His abilities are undoubtedly equal to the mechanical parts of his business as ambassador, but
this is not enough. He cannot dance, drink, game, flatter, promise, dress, swear with the
gentlemen, and small talk and flirt with the ladies; in short, he has none of those essential arts
or ornaments which constitute a courtier. There are thousands who, with a tenth of his
understanding and without a spark of his honesty, would distance him infinitely in any court in
Europe.[138]
Page 14
 While in London Adams wrote his three-volume A Defense of the Constitutions of Government of the
United States of America. It was a response to those he had met in Europe who criticized the government
systems of the American states.[139]
Adams's tenure in Britain was complicated by both countries failing to follow their treaty obligations. The
American states had been delinquent in paying debts owed to British merchants, and in response, the
British refused to vacate forts in the northwest as promised. Adams's attempts to resolve this dispute failed,
and he was often frustrated by a lack of news of progress from home.[140] The news he received of tumult
at home, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays%27_Rebellion"] Shays' Rebellion, heightened his anxiety. He then asked Jay to be relieved;[141] in 1788,
he took his leave of George III, who engaged Adams in polite and formal conversation, promising to
uphold his end of the treaty once America did the same.[142] Adams then went to The Hague to take formal
leave of his ambassadorship there and to secure refinancing from the Dutch, allowing the United States to
meet obligations on earlier loans.[143]
Vice presidency (1789–1797)
Election
On June 17, Adams arrived back in Massachusetts to a triumphant welcome. He returned to farming life in
the months after. The nation's first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1788%E2%80%9389_United_States_presidential_election"] presidential election was soon to take place. Because George
Washington was widely expected to win the presidency, many felt that the vice presidency should go to a
northerner. Although he made no public comments on the matter, Adams was the primary contender.[144]
Each state's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)"] presidential electors gathered on February 4, 1789, to cast their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_3:_Electors"] two votes for the president. The
person with the most votes would be president and the second would become vice president.[145] Adams
received 34 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College"] electoral college votes in the election, second place behind George Washington, who was a
unanimous choice with 69 votes. As a result, Washington became the nation's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States"] first president, and Adams
became its first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_vice_presidents_of_the_United_States"] vice president. Adams finished well ahead of all others except Washington, but was still
offended by Washington receiving more than twice as many votes.[146] In an effort to ensure that Adams
did not accidentally become president and that Washington would have an overwhelming victory,
 Alexander Hamilton convinced at least 7 of the 69 electors not to cast their vote for Adams. After finding
out about the manipulation but not Hamilton's role in it, Adams wrote to Benjamin Rush asking whether "Is
not my election to this office, in the dark and scurvy manner in which it was done, a curse rather than a
blessing?"[146][147]
Although his term started on March 4, 1789, Adams did not begin serving as Vice President of the United
States until April 21, because he did not arrive in New York in time.[148][149]
Tenure
The sole constitutionally prescribed responsibility of the vice president is to preside over the Senate, where
he can cast a tie-breaking vote.[150] Early in his term, Adams became deeply involved in a lengthy Senate
controversy over the official titles for the president and executive officers of the new government. Although
the House agreed that the president should be addressed simply as "George Washington, President of the
United States", the Senate debated the issue at some length. Adams favored the adoption of the style of
Highness (as well as the title of Protector of Their [the United States'] Liberties) for the president.[151]
Some senators favored a variant of Highness or the lesser Excellency."[152] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Federalism"] Anti-federalists in the Senate
objected to the monarchical sound of them all; Jefferson described them as "superlatively ridiculous."[153]
 They argued that these "distinctions," as Adams called them, violated the Constitution's prohibition on titles
of nobility. Adams said that the distinctions were necessary because the highest office of the United States
Page 15
must be marked with "dignity and splendor" to command respect. He
was widely derided for his combative nature and stubbornness,
especially as he actively debated and lectured the senators. "For forty
 minutes he harangued us from the chair," wrote Senator William
Maclay of Pennsylvania. Maclay became Adams's fiercest opponent
and repeatedly expressed personal contempt for him in both public and
private. He likened Adams to "a monkey just put into breeches."[154]
 Ralph Izard suggested that Adams be referred to by the title "His
Rotundity," a joke which soon became popular.[155] On May 14, the
Senate decided that the title of "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._President_(title)"] Mr. President" would be used.[156]
Privately, Adams conceded that his vice presidency had begun poorly
and that perhaps he had been out of the country too long to know the
sentiment of the people. Washington quietly expressed his displeasure
with the fuss and rarely consulted Adams.[157] 
 Portrait of Adams by John
As vice president, Adams largely Trumbull, 1793
sided with the Washington
administration and the emerging
 Federalist Party. He supported Washington's  policies against
 opposition from anti-Federalists and Republicans. He cast 31 tie-
breaking votes, all in support of the administration, and more than any
other vice president.[158] He voted against a bill sponsored by Maclay
that would have required Senate consent for the removal of executive
branch officials who had been confirmed by the Senate.[159] In 1790,
Jefferson, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison, and Hamilton struck a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1790"] bargain guaranteeing
Republican support for Hamilton's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funding_Act_of_1790"] debt assumption plan in exchange

rarely consulted Vice President
Adams, who often felt  Adams played a minor role in politics as vice president. He attended
marginalized and overshadowed
by Washington's prestige. 
few [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_Washington#Cabinet"] cabinet meetings, and the President sought his counsel
infrequently.[150] While Adams brought energy and dedication to the
office,[161] by mid-1789 he had already found it "not quite adapted to
my character ... too inactive, and mechanical."[162] He wrote, "My
country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man
contrived or his imagination conceived."[163] Adams's initial behavior in the Senate made him a target for
critics of the Washington administration. Toward the end of his first term, he grew accustomed to assuming
a marginal role, and rarely intervened in debate.[164] Adams never questioned Washington's courage or
patriotism, but Washington did join Franklin and others as the object of Adams's ire or envy. "The History
of our Revolution will be one continued lie," Adams declared. "... The essence of the whole will be that Dr.
Franklin's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_rod#America"] electrical Rod smote the Earth and out sprung General Washington. That Franklin electrified him
with his Rod – and henceforth these two conducted all the Policy, Negotiations, Legislatures and War."[165]
Adams won reelection with little difficulty in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1792_United_States_presidential_election"] 1792 with 77 votes. His strongest challenger, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clinton_(vice_president)"] George Clinton,
had 50.[166]
On July 14, 1789, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution"] French Revolution began. Republicans were jubilant. Adams at first expressed
cautious optimism, but soon began denouncing the revolutionaries as barbarous and tyrannical.[167]
Washington eventually consulted Adams more often, but not until near the end of his administration, by
which point distinguished cabinet members Hamilton, Jefferson, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Randolph"] Edmund Randolph had all

resigned.[168] The British had been raiding American trading vessels, and John Jay was sent to London to
negotiate an end to hostilities. When he returned in 1795 with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Treaty"] peace treaty on terms unfavorable to the
United States, Adams urged Washington to sign it to prevent war. Washington chose to do so, igniting
protests and riots. He was accused of surrendering American honor to a tyrannical monarchy and of turning
his back on the French Republic.[169] John Adams predicted in a letter to Abigail that ratification would
deeply divide the nation.[170]
Election of 1796
The election of 1796 was the first contested American
presidential election.[171] Twice, George Washington had been
elected to office unanimously but, during his presidency, deep
philosophical differences between the two leading figures in
the administration – Alexander Hamilton and Thomas
Jefferson – had caused a rift, leading to the founding of the
Federalist and Republican parties.[172] When Washington
announced that he would not be a candidate for a third term,
an intense [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(political)"] partisan struggle for control of Congress and the
presidency began.[173]
As in the previous two presidential elections, no candidates 1796 presidential election results
were put forward for voters to choose between in 1796. The
Constitution provided for the selection of electors who would
then choose a president.[174] In seven states voters chose the presidential electors. In the remaining nine
states, they were chosen by the state's legislature.[175] The clear Republican favorite was Jefferson.[176]
Adams was the Federalist frontrunner.[174] The Republicans held a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_nominating_caucus"] congressional nominating caucus and
named Jefferson and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr"] Aaron Burr as their presidential choices.[177] Jefferson at first declined the
nomination, but he agreed to run a few weeks later. Federalist members of Congress held an informal
nominating caucus and named Adams and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pinckney"] Thomas Pinckney as their candidates.[176][178] The campaign
was, for the most part, confined to newspaper attacks, pamphlets, and political rallies;[174] of the four
contenders, only Burr actively campaigned. The practice of not campaigning for office would remain for
many decades.[175] Adams stated that he wanted to stay out of what he called the "silly and wicked game"
of electioneering.[179]
As the campaign progressed, fears grew among Hamilton and his supporters that Adams was too vain,
opinionated, unpredictable and stubborn to follow their directions.[180] Indeed, Adams felt largely left out
of Washington's administration and did not consider himself a strong member of the Federalist Party. He
had remarked that Hamilton's economic program, centered around banks, would "swindle" the poor and
unleash the "gangrene of avarice."[181] Desiring "a more pliant president than Adams," Hamilton
maneuvered to tip the election to Pinckney. He coerced South Carolina Federalist electors, pledged to vote
for "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favorite_son"] favorite son" Pinckney, to scatter their second votes among candidates other than Adams. Hamilton's
scheme was undone when several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England"] New England state electors heard of it and agreed not to vote for
Pinckney.[182] Adams wrote shortly after the election that Hamilton was a "proud Spirited, conceited,
aspiring Mortal always pretending to Morality, with as debauched Morals as old Franklin who is more his
Model than any one I know."[183] Throughout his life, Adams made highly critical statements about
Hamilton. He made derogatory references to his womanizing, real or alleged, and slurred him as the
"[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_peoples"] Creole bastard."[184]
Page 17
In the end, Adams won the presidency by a narrow margin, receiving 71 electoral votes to 68 for Jefferson,
who became the vice president; Pinckney finished in third with 59 votes, and Burr came in fourth with 30.
The balance of the Electoral College votes were dispersed among nine other candidates.[185] This is the
only election to date in which a president and vice president were elected from opposing tickets.[186]
Presidency (1797–1801)
Inauguration
Adams was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_John_Adams"] sworn into office as the nation's second president on
March 4, 1797, by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States"] Chief Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Ellsworth"] Oliver Ellsworth. As president, he
followed Washington's lead in using the presidency to exemplify
republican values and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_virtue"] civic virtue, and his service was free of
scandal.[187] Adams spent much of his term at his Massachusetts
home Peacefield, preferring the quietness of domestic life to  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President%27s_House_(Philadelphia)"] President's House, Philadelphia.
business at the capital. He ignored the political patronage and
office-seekers which other officeholders utilized.[188] 
Adams occupied this Philadelphia
mansion from March 1797 to May
1800.
Historians debate his decision to retain the members of
Washington's cabinet in light of the cabinet's loyalty to Hamilton.
The "Hamiltonians who surround him," Jefferson soon remarked, "are only a little less hostile to him than
to me."[189] Although aware of Hamilton's influence, Adams was convinced that their retention ensured a
smoother succession.[190] Adams maintained the economic programs of Hamilton, who regularly consulted
with key cabinet members, especially the powerful Treasury Secretary, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Wolcott_Jr."] Oliver Wolcott Jr.[191] Adams was
in other respects quite independent of his cabinet, often making decisions despite opposition from it.[192]
Hamilton had grown accustomed to being regularly consulted by Washington. Shortly after Adams was
inaugurated, Hamilton sent him a detailed letter filled with policy suggestions for the new administration.
Adams dismissively ignored it.[193]
Failed peace commission and XYZ affair
Historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Ellis"] Joseph Ellis writes that "[t]he Adams presidency was
destined to be dominated by a single question of American policy
to an extent seldom if ever encountered by any succeeding
occupant of the office." That question was whether to make war
 with France or find peace.[194] In Europe, Britain and France were
at war as a result of the French Revolution. Hamilton and the
Federalists favored the British monarchy against what they
perceived to be the political and anti-religious radicalism of the A political cartoon depicts the XYZ
French Revolution, while Jefferson and the Republicans, with their
firm opposition to monarchy, strongly supported France.[195] The 
Affair – America is a female being
plundered by Frenchmen. (1798)
French had supported Jefferson for president and became even
more belligerent at his loss.[196] When Adams entered office, he
decided to continue Washington's policy of staying out of the war. Because of the Jay Treaty, the French
saw America as Britain's junior partner and began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with
the British. Most Americans were still pro-French due to France's assistance during the Revolution, the
perceived humiliation of the Jay Treaty, and their desire to support a republic against the British monarchy,
and would not tolerate war with France.[197]
Page 18
On May 16, 1797, Adams gave a speech to the House and Senate in which he called for increasing defense
capabilities in case of war with France.[198] He announced that he would send a peace commission to
France but simultaneously called for a military buildup to counter any potential French threat. The speech
was well received by the Federalists. Adams was depicted as an eagle holding an olive branch in one talon
and the "emblems of defense" in the other. The Republicans were outraged, for Adams not only had failed
to express support for the cause of the French Republic but appeared to be calling for war against it.[199]
 Sentiments changed with the XYZ Affair. The peace commission that Adams appointed consisted of John
Marshall, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cotesworth_Pinckney"] Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbridge_Gerry"] Elbridge Gerry.[200] Jefferson met four times with Joseph
Letombe, the French consul in Philadelphia. Letombe wrote to Paris stating that Jefferson had told him that
it was in France's best interest to treat the American ministers civilly but "then drag out the negotiations at
length" to arrive at most favorable solution. According to Letombe, Jefferson called Adams "vain,
suspicious, and stubborn."[201] When the envoys arrived in October, they were kept waiting for several
days, and then granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister Talleyrand. The diplomats
were then met by three of Talleyrand's agents. The French emissaries (later code-named, X, Y, and Z)
refused to conduct negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand
personally, and another to the Republic of France.[200] Supposedly this was to make up for offenses given
to France by Adams in his speech.[202] The Americans refused to negotiate on such terms.[203] Marshall
and Pinckney returned home, while Gerry remained.[204]
News of the disastrous peace mission arrived in the form of a memorandum from Marshall on March 4,
1798. Adams, not wanting to incite violent impulses among the populace, announced that the mission had
failed without providing details.[205] He also sent a message to Congress asking for a renewal of the
nation's defenses. The Republicans frustrated the President's defense measures. Suspecting that he might be
hiding material favorable to France, Republicans in the House, with the support of Federalists who had
heard rumors of what was contained in the messages and were happy to assist the Republicans, voted
overwhelmingly to demand that Adams release the papers. Once they were released, the Republicans,
 according to Abigail, were "struck dumb."[206] Benjamin Franklin Bache, editor of the Philadelphia
Aurora, blamed Adams's aggression as the cause of the disaster. Among the general public, the effects were
very different. The affair substantially weakened popular American support of France. Adams reached the
height of his popularity as many in the country called for full-scale war against the French.[207]
Alien and Sedition Acts
Despite the XYZ Affair, Republican opposition persisted. Federalists accused the French and their
associated immigrants of provoking civil unrest. In an attempt to quell the outcry, the Federalists introduced,
and the Congress passed, a series of laws collectively referred to as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts"] Alien and Sedition Acts, which
 were signed by Adams in June 1798.[208] Congress specifically passed four measures – the Naturalization
Act, the Alien Friends Act, the Alien Enemies Act and the Sedition Act. All came within a period of two
weeks, in what Jefferson called an "unguarded passion." The Alien Friends Act, Alien Enemies Act, and
Naturalization Acts targeted immigrants, specifically French, by giving the president greater deportation
authority and increasing citizenship requirements. The Sedition Act made it a crime to publish "false,
scandalous, and malicious writing" against the government or its officials.[209] Adams had not promoted
any of these acts, but was urged to sign them by his wife and cabinet. He eventually agreed and signed the
bills into law.[210]
The administration initiated fourteen or more indictments under the Sedition Act, as well as suits against
five of the six most prominent Republican newspapers. The majority of the legal actions began in 1798 and
1799, and went to trial on the eve of the 1800 presidential election. Other historians have cited evidence
that the Alien and Sedition Acts were rarely enforced, namely: 1) only 10 convictions under the Sedition
Act have been identified; 2) Adams never signed a deportation order; and 3) the sources of expressed furor
Page 19
over the acts were Republicans. The Acts allowed for the prosecution
 of many who opposed the Federalists.[211] Congressman Matthew
Lyon of Vermont was sentenced to four months in jail for criticizing
the president.[212] Adams resisted Pickering's attempts to deport aliens,
although many left on their own, largely in response to the hostile
environment.[213] Republicans were outraged. Jefferson, disgusted by
the acts, wrote nothing publicly but partnered with Madison to secretly
draft the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_and_Virginia_Resolutions"] Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions. Jefferson, writing for
Kentucky, wrote that states had the "natural right" to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullification_(U.S._Constitution)"] nullify any acts
they deemed unconstitutional. Writing to Madison, he speculated that
as a last resort the states might have to "sever ourselves from the union
we so much value."[214] Federalists reacted bitterly to the resolutions,
which were to have far more lasting implications for the country than
the Alien and Sedition Acts. Still, the acts Adams signed into law
energized and unified the Republican Party while doing little to unite
the Federalists.[215] 
Thomas Jefferson, Adams's vice
president, attempted to

New York Harbor. An increase in attacks on sea marked the beginning
of the undeclared naval war known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-War"] Quasi-War.[216] Adams
knew that America would be unable to win a major conflict, both because of its internal divisions and
because France at the time was dominating the fight in most of Europe. He pursued a strategy whereby
America harassed French ships in an effort sufficient to stem the French assaults on American interests.[217]
In May, shortly after the attack in New York, Congress created a separate Navy Department. The prospect
of a French invasion of the U.S. mainland led for calls to build up the army. Hamilton and other "High
Federalists" were particularly adamant that a large army be called up, in spite of a common fear, particularly
among Republicans, that large standing armies were subversive to liberty. In May, a "provisional" army of
10,000 soldiers was authorized by Congress. In July, Congress created twelve infantry regiments and
provided for six cavalry companies. These numbers exceeded Adams's requests but fell short of
Hamilton's.[218]
Adams was pressured by Federalists to appoint Hamilton, who had served as Washington's aide-de-camp
during the Revolution, to command the army.[219] Distrustful of Hamilton and fearing a plot to subvert his
administration, Adams appointed Washington to command without consulting him. Washington was
surprised, and as a condition of his acceptance demanded that he be permitted to appoint his own
subordinates. He wished to have [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Knox"] Henry Knox as second-in-command, followed by Hamilton, and then
Charles Pinckney.[220] On June 2, Hamilton wrote to Washington stating that he would not serve unless he
was made Inspector General and second-in-command.[221] Washington conceded that Hamilton, despite
holding a rank lower than that of Knox and Pinckney, had, by serving on his staff, more opportunity to
comprehend the whole military scene, and should therefore outrank them. Adams sent Secretary of War
McHenry to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Vernon"] Mount Vernon to convince Washington to accept the post. McHenry put forth his opinion that
Washington would not serve unless permitted to choose his own officers.[222] Adams had intended to
appoint Republicans Burr and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Muhlenberg"] Frederick Muhlenberg to make the army appear bipartisan. Washington's list
consisted entirely of Federalists.[223] Adams relented and agreed to submit to the Senate the names of
Hamilton, Pinckney, and Knox, in that order, although final decisions of rank would be reserved to
Adams.[222] Knox refused to serve under these conditions. Adams firmly intended to give to Hamilton the
lowest possible rank, while Washington and many other Federalists insisted that the order in which the
names had been submitted to the Senate must determine seniority. On September 21, Adams received a
Page 20
letter from McHenry relaying a statement from Washington threatening to resign if Hamilton were not made
second-in-command.[224] Adams knew of the backlash that he would receive from Federalists should he
continue his course, and he was forced to capitulate despite bitter resentment against many of his fellow
Federalists.[225] The severe illness of Abigail, whom Adams feared was near death, exacerbated his
suffering and frustration.[224] 
It quickly became apparent that due to Washington's advanced age,
Hamilton was the army's de facto commander. He exerted effective
control over the War Department, taking over supplies for the
 army.[226] Meanwhile, Adams built up the Navy, adding six fast,
powerful frigates, most notably the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Constitution"] USS Constitution.[227]
The Quasi-War continued, but there was a noticeable decline in
war fever beginning in the fall once news arrived of the French
defeat at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Nile"] Battle of the Nile, which many Americans hoped
would make them more disposed to negotiate.[228] In October,
Adams heard from Gerry in Paris that the French wanted to make
peace and would properly receive an American delegation. That

defenses. The speech angered both Federalists, including Hamilton,
many of whom had wanted a request for a declaration of war, and
Republicans.[229] Hamilton secretly promoted a plan, already
rejected by Adams, in which American and British troops would
combine to seize [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Florida"] Spanish Florida and Louisiana, ostensibly to deter
a possible French invasion. Hamilton's critics, including Abigail,
saw in his military buildups the signs of an aspiring military dictator.[230]
On February 18, 1799, Adams surprised many by nominating diplomat [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Vans_Murray"] William Vans Murray on a peace
mission to France. The decision was made without consulting his cabinet or even Abigail, who nonetheless
upon hearing of it described it as a "master stroke." To placate Republicans, he nominated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Henry"] Patrick Henry
and Ellsworth to accompany Murray and the Senate immediately approved them on March 3. Henry
declined the nomination and Adams chose [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Richardson_Davie"] William Richardson Davie to replace him.[231] Hamilton
strongly criticized the decision, as did Adams's cabinet members, who maintained frequent communication
with him. Adams again questioned the loyalty of those men but did not remove them.[192] To the
annoyance of many, Adams spent a full seven months – March to September – of 1799 in Peacefield,
finally returning to Trenton, where the government had set up temporary quarters due to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_fever"] yellow fever
epidemic, after a letter arrived from Talleyrand confirming Gerry's statement that American ministers would
be received. Adams then decided to send the commissioners to France.[232] Adams arrived back in Trenton
on October 10.[233] Shortly after, Hamilton, in a breach of military protocol, arrived uninvited at the city to
speak with the president, urging him not to send the peace commissioners but instead to ally with Britain,
which he viewed to be the stronger party, to restore the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Bourbon"] Bourbons to France. "I heard him with perfect good
humor, though never in my life did I hear a man talk more like a fool," Adams said. He regarded
Hamilton's idea as chimerical and far-fetched. On November 15, the commissioners set sail for Paris.[234]
Fries's Rebellion
To pay for the military buildup of the Quasi-War, Adams and his Federalist allies enacted the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_tax"] Direct Tax of
1798. Direct taxation by the federal government was widely unpopular, and the government's revenue
under Washington had mostly come from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise_tax"] excise taxes and tariffs. Though Washington had maintained a
balanced budget with the help of a growing economy, increased military expenditures threatened to cause
Page 21
major budget deficits, and the Federalists developed a taxation plan to meet the need for increased
government revenue. The Direct Tax of 1798 instituted a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_tax"] progressive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax"] land value tax of up to 1% of the
value of a property. Taxpayers in eastern Pennsylvania resisted federal tax collectors, and in March 1799
the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out. Led by Revolutionary War veteran [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fries"] John Fries, rural German-
speaking farmers protested what they saw as a threat to their liberties. They intimidated tax collectors, who
often found themselves unable to go about their business.[235] The disturbance was quickly ended with
Hamilton leading the army to restore peace.[236]
Fries and two other leaders were arrested, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to hang. They appealed to
Adams requesting a pardon. The cabinet unanimously advised Adams to refuse, but he instead granted the
pardon, using as justification the argument that the men had instigated a mere riot as opposed to a
rebellion.[237] In his pamphlet attacking Adams before the election, Hamilton wrote that "it was impossible
to commit a greater error."[238]
Federalist divisions and peace
On May 5, 1800, Adams's frustrations with the Hamilton wing of
the party exploded during a meeting with McHenry, a Hamilton
loyalist who was universally regarded, even by Hamilton, as an
inept Secretary of War. Adams accused him of subservience to
Hamilton and declared that he would rather serve as Jefferson's
vice president or minister at The Hague than be beholden to
Hamilton for the presidency. McHenry offered to resign at once,
and Adams accepted. On May 10, he asked Pickering to resign.
Pickering refused and was summarily dismissed. Adams named
John Marshall as Secretary of State and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Dexter"] Samuel Dexter as Secretary
of War.[239][240] In 1799, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon"] Napoleon took over as head of the
French government in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_of_18_Brumaire"] Coup of 18 Brumaire and declared the
French Revolution over.[241] News of this event increased Adams's
desire to disband the provisional army, which, with Washington
now dead, was commanded only by Hamilton.[242] His moves to
end the army after the departures of McHenry and Pickering were
met with little opposition.[243] Rather than allow Adams to receive
the credit, Federalists joined with Republicans in voting to disband
the army in mid-1800.[242] 
 BEP engraved portrait of Adams as

Napoleon, determining that further conflict was pointless, signaled his readiness for friendly relations. By
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_of_1800"] Convention of 1800, the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and to allow for the peaceful
transfer of non-military goods to an enemy of the nation. On January 23, 1801, the Senate voted 16–14 in
favor of the treaty, four votes short of the necessary two thirds. Some Federalists, including Hamilton,
urged that the Senate vote in favor of the treaty with reservations. A new proposal was then drawn up
demanding that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Alliance_(1778)"] Treaty of Alliance of 1778 be superseded and that France pay for its damages to
American property. On February 3, the treaty with the reservations passed 22–9 and was signed by
Adams.[244][c] News of the peace treaty did not arrive in the United States until after the election, too late to
sway the results.[246]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Chernow"] As president, Adams proudly avoided war, but deeply split his party in the process. Historian Ron
Chernow writes that "the threat of Jacobinism" was the one thing that united the Federalist Party, and that
Adams's elimination of it unwittingly contributed to the party's demise.[247]
Page 22
Establishing government institutions and move to Washington
 Adams's leadership on naval defense has sometimes led him to be called the "father of the American
Navy."[248][249] In July 1798, he signed into law [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Act_for_the_relief_of_sick_and_disabled_seamen"] An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen, which
authorized the establishment of a government-operated marine hospital service.[250] In 1800, he signed the
law establishing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress"] Library of Congress.[251]
Adams made his first official visit to the nation's new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seat_of_government"] seat of government in early June 1800. Amid the
"raw and unfinished" cityscape, the President found the public buildings "in a much greater forwardness of
completion than expected."[252] He moved into the nearly completed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"] President's Mansion (later known as
the White House) on November 1. Abigail arrived a few weeks later. Upon arriving, Adams wrote to her,
"Before I end my letter, I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that shall
hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof."[253] The Senate of the
 7th Congress met for the first time in the new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol"] Congress House (later known as the Capitol building) on
November 17, 1800. On November 22, Adams delivered his fourth [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union_Address"] State of the Union Address to a joint
session of Congress in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Supreme_Court_Chamber"] Old Supreme Court Chamber.[254] This would be the last annual message any
president would personally deliver to Congress for the next 113 years.[255]
Election of 1800
With the Federalist Party deeply split over his negotiations
with France, and the opposition Republican Party enraged
over the Alien and Sedition Acts and the expansion of the
military, Adams faced a daunting reelection campaign in
1800.[175] The Federalist congressmen caucused in the spring
 of 1800 and nominated Adams and Charles Cotesworth
Pinckney. The Republicans nominated Jefferson and Burr,
their candidates in the previous election.[256]
The campaign was bitter and characterized by malicious
insults by partisan presses on both sides. Federalists claimed
that the Republicans were the enemies of "all who love order, 1800 presidential election results
peace, virtue, and religion." They were said to be libertines
and dangerous radicals who favored states' rights over the
Union and would instigate anarchy and civil war. Jefferson's rumored [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Hemings"] affairs with slaves were used against
him. Republicans in turn accused Federalists of subverting republican principles through punitive federal
laws and of favoring Britain and the other coalition countries in their war with France to promote
aristocratic, anti-republican values. Jefferson was portrayed as an apostle of liberty and man of the people,
 while Adams was labelled a monarchist. He was accused of insanity and marital infidelity.[257] James T.
Callender, a Republican propagandist secretly financed by Jefferson, degraded Adams's character and
accused him of attempting to make war with France. Callender was arrested and jailed under the Sedition
Act, which only further inflamed Republican passions.[258]
Opposition from the Federalist Party was at times equally intense. Some, including Pickering, accused
Adams of colluding with Jefferson so that he would end up either president or vice president.[259] Hamilton
was hard at work, attempting to sabotage the president's reelection. Planning an indictment of Adams's
character, he requested and received private documents from both the ousted cabinet secretaries and
Wolcott.[260] The letter was intended for only a few Federalist electors. Upon seeing a draft, several
Federalists urged Hamilton not to send it. Wolcott wrote that "the poor old man" could do himself in
without Hamilton's assistance. Hamilton did not heed their advice.[261] On October 24, he sent a pamphlet
Page 23
strongly attacking Adams's policies and character. Hamilton denounced the "precipitate nomination" of
Murray, the pardoning of Fries, and the firing of Pickering. He included a fair share of personal insults,
vilifying the president's "disgusting egotism" and "ungovernable temper." Adams, he concluded, was
"emotionally unstable, given to impulsive and irrational decisions, unable to coexist with his closest
advisers, and generally unfit to be president."[238] Strangely, it ended by saying that the electors should
support Adams and Pinckney equally.[262] Thanks to Burr, who had covertly obtained a copy, the pamphlet
became public knowledge and was distributed throughout the country by Republicans, who rejoiced in
what it contained.[263] The pamphlet destroyed the Federalist Party, ended Hamilton's political career, and
helped ensure Adams's already-likely defeat.[262]
When the electoral votes were counted, Adams finished in third place with 65 votes, and Pinckney came in
fourth with 64 votes. Jefferson and Burr tied for first place with 73 votes each. Because of the tie, the
election devolved upon the House of Representatives, with each state having one vote and a supermajority
required for victory. On February 17, 1801 – on the 36th ballot – Jefferson was elected by a vote of 10 to 4
(two states abstained).[175][185] It is noteworthy that Hamilton's scheme, although it made the Federalists
appear divided and therefore helped Jefferson win, failed in its overall attempt to woo Federalist electors
away from Adams.[264][d]
To compound the agony of his defeat, Adams's son Charles, a long-time alcoholic, died on November 30.
Anxious to rejoin Abigail, who had already left for Massachusetts, Adams departed the White House in the
predawn hours of March 4, 1801, and did not attend [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_inauguration_of_Thomas_Jefferson"] Jefferson's inauguration.[267][268] Including him, only
five out-going presidents (having served a full term) have not attended their successors' inaugurations.[269]
The complications arising out of the 1796 and 1800 elections prompted Congress and the states to refine
 the process whereby the Electoral College elects a president and a vice president through the 12th
Amendment, which became a part of the Constitution in 1804.[270]

due to ill health in 1800, it
fell to Adams to appoint the Court's fourth Chief Justice. At the
time, it was not yet certain whether Jefferson or Burr would win the
election. Regardless, Adams believed that the choice should be
someone "in the full vigor of middle age" who could counter what John Marshall, 4th Chief Justice of
might be a long line of successive Republican presidents. Adams the U.S. Supreme Court and one of
chose his Secretary of State John Marshall.[272] He, along with Adams's few dependable allies
Stoddert, was one of Adams's few trusted cabinet members, and
was among the first to greet him when he arrived at the White
House.[262] Adams signed his commission on January 31 and the Senate approved it immediately.[273]
Marshall's long tenure left a lasting influence on the Court. He maintained a carefully reasoned nationalistic
interpretation of the Constitution and established the judicial branch as the equal of the executive and
legislative branches.[274]
After the Federalists lost control of both houses of Congress along with the White House in the election of
1800, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lame-duck_session"] lame-duck session of the 6th Congress in February 1801 approved a judiciary act, commonly
known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Judges_Act"] Midnight Judges Act, which created a set of federal appeals courts between the district courts
and the Supreme Court. Adams filled the vacancies created in this statute by appointing a series of judges,
whom his opponents called the "Midnight Judges," just days before his term expired. Most of these judges
 lost their posts when the 7th Congress, with a solid Republican majority, approved the Judiciary Act of
1802, abolishing the newly created courts.[275]
Post-presidency (1801–1826)
Initial years
Adams resumed farming at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacefield"] Peacefield in the town of Quincy and began work on an autobiography. The
work had numerous gaps and was eventually abandoned and left unedited.[276] Most of Adams's attention
was focused on farm work.[277] He regularly worked around the farm but mostly left manual labor to hired
hands.[278] His frugal lifestyle and presidential salary had left him with a considerable fortune by 1801. In
1803, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird,_Savage_%26_Bird"] Bird, Savage & Bird, the bank holding his cash reserves of about $13,000 collapsed.[279] John
Quincy resolved the crisis by buying his properties in Weymouth and Quincy, including Peacefield, for
$12,800.[277] During his first four years of retirement, Adams made little effort to contact others, but
eventually resumed contact with old acquaintances such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Waterhouse"] Benjamin Waterhouse and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Rush"] Benjamin Rush.[280]
Page 25
Adams generally stayed quiet on public matters. He did not publicly denounce Jefferson's actions as
president, believing that "instead of opposing Systematically any Administration, running down their
Characters and opposing all their Measures right or wrong, We ought to Support every Administration as
far as We can in Justice."[281][282] When a disgruntled James Callender, angry at not being appointed to an
office, turned on the President by revealing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Hemings"] Sally Hemings affair, Adams said nothing.[283] John
Quincy was elected to the Senate in 1803. Shortly thereafter, both he and his father crossed party lines to
support Jefferson's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase"] Louisiana Purchase.[284] The only major political incident involving Adams during the
Jefferson years was a dispute with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_Otis_Warren"] Mercy Otis Warren in 1806. Warren, an old friend, had written a history
of the American Revolution attacking Adams for his "partiality for monarchy" and "pride of talents and
much ambition." A tempestuous correspondence ensued between her and Adams. In time, their friendship
healed.[285] Adams did privately criticize the President over his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embargo_Act_of_1807"] Embargo Act,[282] despite the fact that
John Quincy voted for it.[286] John Quincy resigned from the Senate in 1808 after the Federalist-controlled
State Senate refused to nominate him for a second term. After the Federalists denounced John Quincy as no
longer being of their party, Adams wrote to him that he himself had long since "abdicated and disclaimed
the name and character and attributes of that sect."[4]
After Jefferson's retirement from public life in 1809, Adams became more vocal. He published a three-year
marathon of letters in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Patriot_(newspaper)"] Boston Patriot newspaper, refuting line-by-line Hamilton's 1800 pamphlet. The
initial piece was written shortly after his return from Peacefield and "had gathered dust for eight years."
Adams had decided to shelve it over fears that it could negatively impact John Quincy should he ever seek
office. Although Hamilton had died in 1804 in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr%E2%80%93Hamilton_duel"] a duel with Aaron Burr, Adams felt the need to vindicate his
character against his charges. With his son having broken from the Federalist Party and joined the
Republicans, he felt he could safely do so without threatening his political career.[287] Adams supported the
 War of 1812. Having worried over the rise of sectionalism, he celebrated the growth of a "national
character" that accompanied it.[288] Adams supported [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison for reelection to the presidency in
1812.[289]
Daughter [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail_Adams_Smith"] Abigail ("Nabby") was married to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressman"] Representative [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stephens_Smith"] William Stephens Smith, but she returned to
her parents' home after the failure of the marriage; she died of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"] breast cancer in 1813.[290]
Correspondence with Jefferson
In early 1801, Adams sent Thomas Jefferson a brief note after returning to Quincy wishing him a happy
and prosperous presidency. Jefferson failed to respond, and they did not speak again for nearly 12 years. In
1804, Abigail, unbeknownst to her husband, wrote to Jefferson to express her condolences upon the death
of his daughter Polly, who had stayed with the Adamses in London in 1787. This initiated a brief
correspondence between the two which quickly descended into political rancor. Jefferson terminated it by
not replying to Abigail's fourth letter. Aside from that, by 1812 there had been no communication between
Monticello, the home of Jefferson, and Peacefield since Adams left office.[291]
In early 1812, Adams reconciled with Jefferson. The previous year had been tragic for Adams; his brother-
in-law and friend Richard Cranch had died along with his widow Mary, and Nabby had been diagnosed
with breast cancer. These events mellowed Adams and caused him to soften his outlook.[287] Their mutual
friend Benjamin Rush, a fellow signer of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence"] Declaration of Independence who had been corresponding
with both, encouraged them to reach out to each other. On New Year's Day, Adams sent a brief, friendly
note to Jefferson to accompany a two-volume collection of lectures on rhetoric by John Quincy Adams.
Jefferson replied immediately with a cordial letter, and the two men revived their friendship, which they
sustained by mail. The correspondence that they resumed in 1812 lasted the rest of their lives, and has been
hailed as among their great legacies of American literature. Their letters represent an insight into both the
period and the minds of the two revolutionary leaders and presidents. The missives lasted fourteen years,
and consisted of 158 letters – 109 from Adams and 49 from Jefferson.[292]
Page 26
Early on, Adams repeatedly tried to turn the correspondence to a
discussion of their actions in the political arena.[293] Jefferson
refused to oblige him, saying that "nothing new can be added by
you or me to what has been said by others and will be said in every
age."[294] Adams made one more attempt, writing that "You and I
ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each
other."[295] Still, Jefferson declined to engage Adams in this sort of
discussion. Adams accepted this, and the correspondence turned to
other matters, particularly philosophy and their daily habits.[296][e]
As the two men became older, the letters grew fewer and further
between. There was also important information that each man kept
to himself. Jefferson said nothing about his construction of a new
house, domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial
situation, while Adams did not mention the troublesome behavior
of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer and become an
alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at
Peacefield.[299]

Last years and death
Abigail died of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid"] typhoid on October 28, 1818, at their Quincy home, Peacefield.[300] The year 1824 was
filled with excitement in America, featuring a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1824_United_States_presidential_election"] four-way presidential contest that included John Quincy. The
 Marquis de Lafayette toured the country and met with Adams, who greatly enjoyed Lafayette's visit to
Peacefield.[301] Adams was delighted by the election of John Quincy to the presidency. The results became
official in February 1825 after a deadlock was decided in the House of Representatives. He remarked, "No
man who ever held the office of President would congratulate a friend on obtaining it."[302]
Less than a month before his death, Adams issued a statement
about the destiny of the United States, which historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joy_Hakim"] Joy Hakim
characterized as a warning for his fellow citizens: "My best wishes,
in the joys, and festivities, and the solemn services of that day on
which will be completed the fiftieth year from its birth, of the
independence of the United States: a memorable epoch in the
annals of the human race, destined in future history to form the
brightest or the blackest page, according to the use or the abuse of
those political institutions by which they shall, in time to come, be
shaped by the human mind."[303] 
Tombs of John and Abigail Adams
On July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the
Declaration of Independence, Adams died at Peacefield at
approximately 6:20 pm.[304] His last words included an

Adams was the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_by_age"] longest-lived US president until [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan"] Ronald Reagan surpassed him in 2001.[307]

Political writings
Page 27
Thoughts on Government
During the First Continental Congress, Adams was sometimes
solicited for his views on government. While recognizing its
importance, Adams had privately criticized [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine"] Thomas Paine's 1776
pamphlet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Sense_(pamphlet)"] Common Sense, which attacked all forms of monarchy,
even constitutional monarchy of the sort advocated by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke"] John Locke.
It supported a unicameral legislature and a weak executive elected
by the legislature. According to Adams, the author had "a better
hand at pulling down than building."[309] He believed that the
views expressed in the pamphlet were "so democratical, without
any restraint or even an attempt at any equilibrium or counter poise,
that it must produce confusion and every evil work."[310] What
Paine advocated was a radical democracy with the views of the
majority neither checked nor counterbalanced. This was
incompatible with the system of checks and balances that
conservatives like Adams would implement.[311] Some delegates
urged Adams to commit his views to paper. He did so in separate
letters to these colleagues. So impressed was Richard Henry Lee
that, with Adams's consent, he had the most comprehensive letter
printed. Published anonymously in April 1776, it was titled
 Thoughts on Government and styled as "a Letter from a Gentleman
to his Friend." Many historians agree that none of Adams's other
compositions rivaled the enduring influence of this pamphlet.[78] 
Peacefield - John Adams' Home
Adams advised that the form of government should be chosen to
attain the desired ends – the happiness and virtue of the greatest
number of people. He wrote that, "There is no good government
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_Kingdom"] but what is republican. That the only valuable part of the British
constitution is so because the very definition of a republic is an
empire of laws, and not of men."  The treatise defended [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoughts_on_Government"] Thoughts on Government (1776)
bicameralism, for "a single assembly is liable to all the vices, follies
and frailties of an individual."[312] Adams suggested that there
should be a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers"] separation of powers between the executive, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial"] judicial and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative"] legislative branches, and
further recommended that if a continental government were to be formed then it "should sacredly be
confined" to certain [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_powers"] enumerated powers. Thoughts on Government was referenced in every state-
 constitution writing hall. Adams used the letter to attack opponents of independence. He claimed that John
Dickinson's fear of republicanism was responsible for his refusal to support independence, and wrote that
opposition from Southern planters was rooted in fear that their aristocratic slaveholding status would be
endangered by it.[78]
Massachusetts Constitution
 After returning from his first mission to France in 1779, Adams was elected to the Massachusetts
Constitutional Convention with the purpose of establishing a new constitution for Massachusetts. He served
on a committee of three, also including Samuel Adams and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bowdoin"] James Bowdoin, to draft the constitution. The
task of writing it fell primarily to John Adams. The resulting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Massachusetts"] Constitution of Massachusetts was approved
in 1780. It was the first constitution written by a special committee, then ratified by the people; and was the
first to feature a bicameral legislature. Included were a distinct executive – though restrained by an
executive council – with a qualified (two-thirds) veto, and an independent judicial branch. The judges were
given lifetime appointments, allowed to "hold their offices during good behavior."[313]
Page 28
The Constitution affirmed the "duty" of the individual to worship the "Supreme Being," and that he had the
right to do so without molestation "in the manner most agreeable to the dictates of his own
conscience."[314] It established a system of public education that would provide free schooling for three
years to the children of all citizens.[315] Adams was a strong believer in good education as one of the pillars
of the Enlightenment. He believed that people "in a State of Ignorance" were more easily enslaved while
those "enlightened with knowledge" would be better able to protect their liberties.[316] Adams became one
of the founders of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences"] American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.[317]
Defence of the Constitutions
Adams's preoccupation with political and governmental affairs – which caused considerable separation
from his wife and children – had a distinct familial context, which he articulated in 1780: "I must study
Politicks and War that my sons may have the liberty to study Mathematicks and Philosophy. My sons ought
to study Geography, natural History, Naval Architecture, navigation, Commerce and Agriculture, in order
to give their children a right to study Painting, Poetry, Musick, Architecture, Statuary, Tapestry, and
Porcelaine."[318]
While in London, Adams learned of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)"] convention being planned to amend the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation"] Articles of Confederation. In
January 1787, he published a work entitled A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United
States.[319] The pamphlet repudiated the views of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Robert_Jacques_Turgot,_Baron_de_Laune"] Turgot and other European writers as to the viciousness
of state government frameworks. He suggested that "the rich, the well-born and the able" should be set
apart from other men in a senate – that would prevent them from dominating the lower house. Adams's
Defence is described as an articulation of the theory of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_government"] mixed government. Adams contended that social
classes exist in every political society, and that a good government must accept that reality. For centuries,
dating back to Aristotle, a mixed regime balancing monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy – that is, the
king, the nobles, and the people – was required to preserve order and liberty.[320]
Historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_S._Wood"] Gordon S. Wood has maintained that Adams's political philosophy had become irrelevant by the
time the Federal Constitution was ratified. By then, American political thought, transformed by more than a
decade of vigorous debate as well as formative experiential pressures, had abandoned the classical
perception of politics as a mirror of social estates. Americans' new understanding of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_sovereignty"] popular sovereignty
was that the citizenry were the sole possessors of power in the nation. Representatives in the government
enjoyed mere portions of the people's power and only for a limited time. Adams was thought to have
overlooked this evolution and revealed his continued attachment to the older version of politics.[321] Yet
Wood was accused of ignoring Adams's peculiar definition of the term "republic," and his support for a
constitution ratified by the people.[322]
On [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers"] separation of powers, Adams wrote that, "Power must be opposed to power, and interest to
interest."[323] This sentiment was later echoed by James Madison's statement that, "[a]mbition must be
made to counteract ambition," in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._51"] Federalist No. 51, explaining the separation of powers established under
the new Constitution.[323][324] Adams believed that human beings were naturally desirous of furthering
their own ambitions, and a single democratically elected house, if left unchecked, would be subject to this
error, and therefore needed to be checked by an upper house and an executive. He wrote that a strong
executive would defend the people's liberties against "aristocrats" attempting to take it away.[325]
Adams first saw the new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution"] United States Constitution in late 1787. To Jefferson, he wrote that he read it
"with great satisfaction." Adams expressed regret that the president would be unable to make appointments
without [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate"] Senate approval and over the absence of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights"] Bill of Rights. "Should not such a thing have preceded
the model?" he asked.[326]
Page 29
Political philosophy and views
Slavery
Adams never owned a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States"] slave and declined on principle to use slave labor, saying, "I have, through my
whole life, held the practice of slavery in such abhorrence, that I have never owned a negro or any other
slave, though I have lived for many years in times, when the practice was not disgraceful, when the best
men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character, and when it has cost me thousands of
dollars for the labor and subsistence of free men, which I might have saved by the purchase of negroes at
times when they were very cheap."[327] Before the war, he occasionally represented slaves in suits for their
freedom.[328] Adams generally tried to keep the issue out of national politics, because of the anticipated
Southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence. He spoke out in 1777
against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts, saying that the issue was presently too divisive, and so
the legislation should "sleep for a time." He also was against use of black soldiers in the Revolution due to
opposition from Southerners.[329] Slavery was abolished in Massachusetts about 1780, when it was
forbidden by implication in the Declaration of Rights that John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts
Constitution.[330] Abigail Adams vocally opposed slavery.[331]
Accusations of monarchism
Throughout his lifetime Adams expressed controversial and shifting views regarding the virtues of
monarchical and hereditary political institutions.[332] At times he conveyed substantial support for these
approaches, suggesting for example that "hereditary monarchy or aristocracy" are the "only institutions that
can possibly preserve the laws and liberties of the people."[333] Yet at other times he distanced himself from
such ideas, calling himself "a mortal and irreconcilable enemy to Monarchy" and "no friend to hereditary
limited monarchy in America."[153] Such denials did not assuage his critics, and Adams was often accused
of being a monarchist.[334] Historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton_Rossiter"] Clinton Rossiter portrays Adams not as a monarchist but a
revolutionary conservative who sought to balance republicanism with the stability of monarchy to create
"ordered liberty."[335] His 1790 Discourses on Davila published in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazette_of_the_United_States"] Gazette of the United States warned
once again of the dangers of unbridled democracy.[336]
Many attacks on Adams were scurrilous, including suggestions that he was planning to "crown himself
king" and "grooming John Quincy as heir to the throne."[334] Peter Shaw has argued that: "[T]he inevitable
attacks on Adams, crude as they were, stumbled on a truth that he did not admit to himself. He was leaning
toward monarchy and aristocracy (as distinct from kings and aristocrats) ... Decidedly, sometime after he
became vice-president, Adams concluded that the United States would have to adopt a hereditary
legislature and a monarch ... and he outlined a plan by which state conventions would appoint hereditary
senators while a national one appointed a president for life."[337] In contrast to such notions, Adams
asserted in a letter to Thomas Jefferson:
If you suppose that I have ever had a design or desire of attempting to introduce a government
of King, Lords and Commons, or in other words an hereditary Executive, or an hereditary
Senate, either into the government of the United States, or that of any individual state, in this
country, you are wholly mistaken. There is not such a thought expressed or intimated in any
public writing or private letter of mine, and I may safely challenge all of mankind to produce
such a passage and quote the chapter and verse.[338]
Page 30
According to Luke Mayville, Adams synthesized two strands of thought: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science"] practical study of past and present
governments, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Enlightenment"] Scottish Enlightenment thinking concerning individual desires expressed in politics.[339]
Adams's conclusion was that the great danger was that an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy"] oligarchy of the wealthy would take hold to the
detriment of equality. To counter that danger, the power of the wealthy needed to be channeled by
institutions, and checked by a strong executive.[339][325]
Religious views
Adams was raised a Congregationalist, since his ancestors were
Puritans. According to biographer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McCullough"] David McCullough, "as his
family and friends knew, Adams was both a devout Christian, and
an independent thinker, and he saw no conflict in that."[341] In a
letter to Rush, Adams credited religion with the success of his
ancestors since their migration to the New World.[342] He believed
that regular church service was beneficial to man's moral sense.
Everett (1966) concludes that "Adams strove for a religion based
on a common sense sort of reasonableness" and maintained that
religion must change and evolve toward perfection.[343] Fielding
(1940) argues that Adams's beliefs synthesized Puritan, deist, and
 humanist concepts. Adams at one point said that Christianity had
originally been revelatory, but was being misinterpreted in the
service of superstition, fraud, and unscrupulous power.[344] 
John Adams by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Stuart"] Gilbert Stuart (1823).
This portrait was the last made of
Adams, done at the request of John
Quincy.[340]
Frazer (2004) notes that while he shared many perspectives with
deists and often used deistic terminology, "Adams clearly was not a
deist. Deism rejected any and all supernatural activity and intervention by God; consequently, deists did not
believe in miracles or God's providence. ... Adams did believe in miracles, providence, and, to a certain
extent, the Bible as revelation."[345] Frazer argues that Adams's "theistic rationalism, like that of the other
Founders, was a sort of middle ground between Protestantism and deism."[346] In 1796, Adams denounced
 Thomas Paine's deistic criticisms of Christianity in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Reason"] The Age of Reason, saying, "The Christian religion is,
above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom,
virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will."[347]
But historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_S._Wood"] Gordon S. Wood (2017) writes, "Although both Jefferson and Adams denied the miracles of
the Bible and the divinity of Christ, Adams always retained a respect for the religiosity of people that
Jefferson never had; in fact, Jefferson tended in private company to mock religious feelings."[348]
In his retirement years, Adams moved away from some of the Puritan sentiments of his youth and closer to
more mainstream Enlightenment religious ideals. He blamed institutional Christianity for causing much
suffering but continued to be an active Christian while maintaining that religion was necessary for society.
He became a Unitarian, rejecting the divinity of Jesus.[349]
Legacy
Historical reputation
Franklin summed up what many thought of Adams when he said, "He means well for his country, is
always an honest man, often a wise one, but sometimes, and in some things, absolutely out of his
senses."[350] Adams came to be seen as someone with a long, distinguished, and honorable career in public
Page 31
service, and a man of great patriotism and integrity, but whose vanity, stubbornness, and cantankerousness
often got him into unnecessary trouble. Adams strongly felt that he would be forgotten and
underappreciated by history. These feelings often manifested themselves through envy and verbal attacks
on other Founders.[165][351]
Historian George Herring argues that Adams was the most independent-minded of the Founders.[352]
Though he formally aligned with the Federalists, he was somewhat a party unto himself, at times
disagreeing with the Federalists as much as he did the Republicans.[353] He was often described as
"prickly", but his tenacity was fed by decisions made in the face of universal opposition.[352] Adams was
often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as he admitted in his old age: "[As President] I
refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed. And I
must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore."[354] Stubbornness was seen as one of his
defining traits, a fact for which Adams made no apology. "Thanks to God that he gave me stubbornness
when I know I am right," he wrote.[355] His resolve to advance peace with France while maintaining a
posture of defense reduced his popularity and contributed to his defeat for reelection.[356] Most historians
applaud him for avoiding an all-out war with France during his presidency. His signing of the Alien and
Sedition Acts is almost always condemned.[357]
According to Ferling, Adams's political philosophy fell "out of step" with the way that the country was
heading. The country tended further away from Adams's emphasis on order and the rule of law and
towards the Jeffersonian vision of liberty and weak central government. In the years following his
retirement from public life, as first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffersonian_democracy"] Jeffersonianism and then [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonian_democracy"] Jacksonian democracy grew to dominate
American politics, Adams was largely forgotten.[358] When his name was mentioned, it was typically not
in a favorable way. In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1840_United_States_presidential_election"] 1840 presidential election, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)"] Whig candidate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison"] William Henry Harrison was attacked
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"] Democrats on the false allegation that he had once been a supporter of John Adams.[359] Adams was
eventually subject to criticism from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States%27_rights"] states' rights advocates. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_A._Pollard"] Edward A. Pollard, a strong supporter of the
 Confederacy during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"] American Civil War, singled out Adams, writing:
The first President from the North, John Adams, asserted and essayed to put into practice the
supremacy of the "National" power over the states and the citizens thereof. He was sustained
in his attempted usurpations by all the New England states and by a powerful public sentiment
in each of the Middle States. The "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_constructionism"] strict constructionists" of the Constitution were not slow in
raising the standard of opposition against a pernicious error.[360]
In the 21st century, Adams remains less well known than many of America's other Founding Fathers, in
accordance with his predictions. McCullough argued that "[t]he problem with Adams is that most
Americans know nothing about him." Todd Leopold of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN"] CNN wrote in 2001 that Adams is "remembered as
that guy who served a single term as president between Washington and Jefferson, and as a short, vain,
somewhat rotund man whose stature seems to have been dwarfed by his lanky colleagues."[361] He has
always been seen, Ferling says, as "honest and dedicated", but despite his lengthy career in public service,
Adams is still overshadowed by the dramatic military and political achievements and strong personalities of
his contemporaries.[362] Gilbert Chinard, in his 1933 biography of Adams, described the man as "staunch,
honest, stubborn and somewhat narrow."[363] In his two-volume 1962 biography, Page Smith lauds Adams
for his fight against radicals such as Thomas Paine, whose promised reforms portended anarchy and misery.
Ferling, in his 1992 biography, writes that "Adams was his own worst enemy." He criticizes him for his
"pettiness ... jealousy, and vanity", and faults him for his frequent separations from his wife and children.
He praises Adams for his willingness to acknowledge his deficiencies and for striving to overcome them. In
1976, Peter Shaw published The Character of John Adams. Ferling believes that the man who emerges is
one "perpetually at war with himself",  whose desire for fame and recognition leads to charges of
vanity.[364]
Page 32
In 2001, David McCullough published a biography of the president entitled [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_(book)"] John Adams. McCullough
lauds Adams for consistency and honesty, "plays down or explains away" his more controversial actions,
such as the dispute over presidential titles and the predawn flight from the White House, and criticizes his
friend and rival, Jefferson. The book sold very well and was very favorably received and, along with the
Ferling biography, contributed to a rapid resurgence in Adams's reputation.[365] In 2008, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_(miniseries)"] miniseries was
released based on the McCullough biography, featuring [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Giamatti"] Paul Giamatti as Adams.[366]
In memoriam
Adams is commemorated as the namesake of various counties, buildings, and other items.[251][367][368]
One example is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_Building"] John Adams Building of the Library of Congress, an institution whose existence
Adams had signed into law.[251]
While Adams is honored on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_to_the_56_Signers_of_the_Declaration_of_Independence"] Memorial to the 56 Signers of the Declaration of Independence in
Washington D.C.,[369] he does not have an individual monument dedicated to him in the city.[370]
Although a family inclusive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_Memorial"] Adams Memorial was authorized in 2001, it awaits funding and 10 appointees
to the 12-person committee. According to McCullough, "Popular symbolism has not been very generous
toward Adams. There is no memorial, no statue ... in his honor in our nation's capital, and to me that is
absolutely inexcusable. It's long past time when we should recognize what he did, and who he was."[371]
Explanatory notes
a. Old style: October 19, 1735
b. The site of the Adams house is now in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quincy,_Massachusetts"] Quincy, Massachusetts, which was separated from
Braintree and organized as a new town in 1792.
c. Jefferson, after entering office, approved a negotiated end to the 1778 alliance, freeing the
United States of foreign entanglements, while excusing France from paying indemnities.[245]
d. Ferling attributes Adams's defeat to five factors: the stronger organization of the
Republicans; Federalist disunity; the controversy surrounding the Alien and Sedition Acts;
the popularity of Jefferson in the South; and the effective politicking of Burr in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)"] New York.[265]
Adams wrote, "No party that ever existed knew itself so little or so vainly overrated its own
influence and popularity as ours. None ever understood so ill the causes of its own power, or
so wantonly destroyed them."[266] Stephen G. Kurtz argues that Hamilton and his supporters
were primarily responsible for the destruction of the Federalist Party. They viewed the party
as a personal tool and played into the hands of the Jeffersonians by building up a large
standing army and creating a feud with Adams.[226] Chernow writes that Hamilton believed
that by eliminating Adams, he could eventually pick up the pieces of the ruined Federalist
Party and lead it back to dominance: "Better to purge Adams and let Jefferson govern for a
while than to water down the party's ideological purity with compromises."[264]
e. The two men discussed "natural aristocracy." Jefferson said, "The natural aristocracy I
consider as the most precious gift of nature for the instruction, the trusts, and government of
society. And indeed it would have been inconsistent in creation to have formed man for the
social state, and not to have provided virtue and wisdom enough to manage the concerns of
society. May we not even say that the form of government is best which provides most
effectually for a pure selection of these natural [aristocrats] into the offices of
government?"[297] Adams wondered if it ever would be so clear who these people were,
"Your distinction between natural and artificial aristocracy does not appear to me well
founded. Birth and wealth are conferred on some men as imperiously by nature, as genius,
strength, or beauty. ... When aristocracies are established by human laws and honour,
wealth, and power are made hereditary by municipal laws and political institutions, then I
Page 33
acknowledge artificial aristocracy to commence." It would always be true, Adams argued,
that fate would bestow influence on some men for reasons other than wisdom and virtue. A
good government had to account for that reality.[298]
