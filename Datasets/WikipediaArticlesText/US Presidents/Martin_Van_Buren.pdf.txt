Martin Van Buren ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /væn ˈbjʊərən/ [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key"] van BYURE-ən; born
 Maarten van Buren (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈmaːrtə(ɱ) vɑm
ˈbyːrə(n)]  ); December 5, 1782 – July 24, 1862) was an
 American lawyer and statesman who served as the 8th president
of the United States from 1837 to 1841. A founder of the
 Democratic Party, he had previously served as the 9th governor
of New York, the 10th [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_secretary_of_state"] United States secretary of state, and the
8th [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States"] vice president of the United States. Later in his life, Van
Buren emerged as an elder statesman and an important anti-
 slavery leader who led the Free Soil Party ticket in the 1848
presidential election. 
Martin Van Buren
Van Buren was born in Kinderhook, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)"] New York, where most
residents were of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people"] Dutch descent and spoke [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language"] Dutch as their
primary language. He was the first president to have been born
after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution"] American Revolution — in which his father served as
a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)"] patriot — and is the only president to have spoken English as
a second language. Trained as a lawyer, he entered politics as a
member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party"] Democratic-Republican Party, won a seat in the
 New York State Senate, and was elected to the United States
Senate in 1821. As the leader of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucktails"] Bucktails faction, Van
Buren emerged as the most influential politician from New
York in the 1820s and established a political machine known as
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_Regency"] Albany Regency.
Following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1824_United_States_presidential_election"] 1824 presidential election, Van Buren sought to
re-establish a two-party system with partisan differences based
on ideology rather than personalities or sectional differences; he
supported Jackson's candidacy in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1828_United_States_presidential_election"] 1828 presidential election
with this goal in mind. He ran successfully for governor of New
York to support Jackson's campaign, but resigned shortly after
Jackson was inaugurated so that he could accept appointment as
Jackson's secretary of state. In his cabinet position, Van Buren
became a key Jackson advisor, and built the organizational
structure for the coalescing Democratic Party. He ultimately
resigned to help resolve the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petticoat_affair"] Petticoat affair, and briefly served
as the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom. At Jackson's
behest, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1832_Democratic_National_Convention"] 1832 Democratic National Convention nominated
Van Buren for vice president of the United States, and he took
 office after the Democratic ticket won the 1832 presidential
election.
With Jackson's strong support and the organizational strength of
the Democratic Party, Van Buren successfully ran for president
in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1836_United_States_presidential_election"] 1836 presidential election, defeating several Whig
opponents. However, his popularity soon eroded with his

response to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1837"] Panic of 1837, which centered on his
 Independent Treasury system, a plan under which the federal
government of the United States would store its funds in vaults
rather than in banks; more conservative Democrats and Whigs
in Congress ultimately delayed his plan from being
implemented until 1840. His presidency was further marred by
the costly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Seminole_War"] Second Seminole War (a result of continuing
Jackson's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_removal"] Indian removal policy); and his refusal to admit Texas
to the Union as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_states_and_free_states"] slave state as an attempt to avoid heightened
sectional tensions. In 1840, Van Buren lost his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1840_United_States_presidential_election"] re-election bid to
 William Henry Harrison, the nominee of the anti-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonian_democracy"] Jacksonian
 Whig Party.
Van Buren was initially the leading candidate for the
Democratic Party's nomination again in 1844, but his continued
opposition to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_annexation"] annexation of Texas angered Southern
Democrats, leading to the nomination of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_K._Polk"] James K. Polk instead.
Van Buren was the newly formed Free Soil Party's presidential
nominee in 1848, and his candidacy helped Whig nominee
 Zachary Taylor defeat Democrat [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Cass"] Lewis Cass. Van Buren
returned to the Democratic Party after 1848, but grew
increasingly opposed to slavery, and became one of the party's
outspoken abolitionists. He supported the policies of President
 Abraham Lincoln, a Republican, during the American Civil
War. He died in Kinderhook in July 1862, aged 79.
In historical rankings, historians and political scientists often
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States"] rank Van Buren as an average or below-average U.S. president,
due to his handling of the Panic of 1837. However, Van Buren
is largely remembered today as a leader in the formation of the
 two-party system in the United States.

His father, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Van_Buren_(I)"] Abraham Van Buren, was a descendant of Cornelis Maessen, a
native of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buurmalsen"] Buurmalsen, Netherlands who had emigrated to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Netherland"] New Netherland
in 1631 and purchased a plot of land on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Island"] Manhattan Island.[5][6] Van Buren
was the first U.S President without any [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_peoples"] British ancestry. [7] Abraham Van
Buren had been a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)"] Patriot during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution"] American Revolution,[8][9] and he later
joined the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party"] Democratic-Republican Party.[10] He owned an inn and tavern
in Kinderhook and served as Kinderhook's town clerk for several years. In
 1776, he married Maria Hoes (or Goes) Van Alen (1746-1818) in the town
of Kinderhook, also of Dutch extraction and the widow of Johannes Van
Alen (1744-c. 1773).  She had three children from her first marriage,
including future U.S. Representative [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_I._Van_Alen"] James I. Van Alen. Her second
marriage produced five children, of which Martin was the third.[11]

Buren's first name,
"Maarten" 
Van Buren received a basic education at the village schoolhouse, and
 briefly studied Latin at the Kinderhook Academy and at Washington
Seminary in Claverack.[12][13] Van Buren was raised speaking primarily
Dutch and learned English while attending school;[14] he is the only
President whose first language was not English.[15] Also during his
childhood, Van Buren learned at his father's inn how to interact with people from varied ethnic, income,
and societal groups, which he used to his advantage as a political organizer.[16] His formal education ended
in 1796, when he began reading law at the office of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Silvester_(1734%E2%80%931808)"] Peter Silvester and his son Francis.[17]
Van Buren, at 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m) tall, was small in stature, and affectionately nicknamed "Little
Van".[18] When he began his legal studies he wore rough, homespun clothing,[19] causing the Silvesters to
admonish him to pay greater heed to his clothing and personal appearance as an aspiring lawyer. He
accepted their advice, and subsequently emulated the Silvesters' clothing, appearance, bearing, and
conduct.[20][21] The lessons he learned from the Silvesters were reflected in his career as a lawyer and
politician, in which Van Buren was known for his amiability and fastidious appearance.[22] Despite
Kinderhook's strong affiliation with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party"] Federalist Party, of which the Silvesters were also strong
supporters, Van Buren adopted his father's Democratic-Republican leanings.[23] The Silvesters and
Democratic-Republican political figure [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Peter_Van_Ness"] John Peter Van Ness suggested that Van Buren's political leanings
constrained him to complete his education with a Democratic-Republican attorney, so he spent a final year
of apprenticeship in the New York City office of John Van Ness's brother [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_P._Van_Ness"] William P. Van Ness, a political
lieutenant of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr"] Aaron Burr.[24] Van Ness introduced Van Buren to the intricacies of New York state politics,
 and Van Buren observed Burr's battles for control of the state Democratic-Republican party against George
 Clinton and Robert R. Livingston.[25] He returned to Kinderhook in 1803, after his admission to the New
York bar.[26]
Van Buren married [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Van_Buren"] Hannah Hoes (or Goes) in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catskill,_New_York"] Catskill, New York, on February 21, 1807. She was his
childhood sweetheart, and a daughter of his maternal first cousin, Johannes Dircksen Hoes.[27] She grew
up in Valatie, and like Van Buren her home life was primarily Dutch; she spoke Dutch as her first language,
and spoke English with a marked accent.[28] The couple had five children, four of whom lived to
adulthood: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Van_Buren"] Abraham (1807–1873), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Van_Buren"] John (1810–1866), Martin Jr. (1812–1855), Winfield Scott (born and
died in 1814),  and Smith Thompson (1817–1876).[29] Hannah contracted tuberculosis, and died in
Kinderhook on February 5, 1819, at age 35.[30] Van Buren never remarried.[31]
Early political career
Page 5
Upon returning to Kinderhook in 1803, Van Buren formed a law
partnership with his half-brother, James Van Alen, and became financially
secure enough to increase his focus on politics.[32] Van Buren had been
active in politics from age 18, if not before. In 1801, he attended a
 Democratic-Republican Party convention in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy,_New_York"] Troy, New York, where he
worked successfully to secure for John Peter Van Ness the party
nomination in a special election for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York%27s_6th_congressional_district"] 6th Congressional District seat.[33]
Upon returning to Kinderhook, Van Buren broke with the Burr faction,
becoming an ally of both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeWitt_Clinton"] DeWitt Clinton and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_D._Tompkins"] Daniel D. Tompkins. After
the faction led by Clinton and Tompkins dominated the 1807 elections,
Van Buren was appointed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probate_court"] Surrogate of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_County,_New_York"] Columbia County, New York.[34]
Seeking a better base for his political and legal career, Van Buren and his
family moved to the town of Hudson, the seat of Columbia County, in
1808.[35] Van Buren's legal practice continued to flourish, and he traveled
all over the state to represent various clients.[36] 
 Hannah Van Buren
 In 1812, Van Buren won his party's nomination for a seat in the New
York State Senate. Though several Democratic-Republicans, including
John Peter Van Ness, joined with the Federalists to oppose his candidacy,
Van Buren won election to the state senate in mid-1812.[37] Later in the
year, the United States entered the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812"] War of 1812 against Great Britain,
 while Clinton launched an unsuccessful bid to defeat President James
Madison in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1812_United_States_presidential_election"] 1812 presidential election. After the election, Van Buren
became suspicious that Clinton was working with the Federalist Party,
and he broke from his former political ally.[38]
During the War of 1812, Van Buren worked with Clinton, Governor
Tompkins, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrose_Spencer"] Ambrose Spencer to support the Madison administration's
prosecution of the war.[39] In addition, he was a special judge advocate
appointed to serve as a prosecutor of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hull"] William Hull during Hull's court-
martial following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Detroit"] surrender of Detroit.[40][41] Anticipating another
military campaign, he collaborated with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winfield_Scott"] Winfield Scott on ways to 
Painting of Van Buren by
Daniel Dickinson, c. 1820s
reorganize the New York Militia in the winter of 1814–1815, but the end
of the war halted their work in early 1815.[42] Van Buren was so favorably impressed by Scott that he
named his fourth son after him.[43] Van Buren's strong support for the war boosted his standing, and in
1815, he was elected to the position of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Attorney_General"] New York Attorney General. Van Buren moved from Hudson to the
state capital of Albany, where he established a legal partnership with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin_Butler_(lawyer)"] Benjamin Butler,[44] and shared a
house with political ally [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Skinner"] Roger Skinner.[45] In 1816, Van Buren won re-election to the state senate, and he
would continue to simultaneously serve as both state senator and as the state's attorney general.[46] In 1819,
he played an active part in prosecuting the accused murderers of Richard Jennings, the first murder-for-hire
case in the state of New York.[47]
Albany regency
After Tompkins was elected as vice president in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1816_United_States_presidential_election"] 1816 presidential election, Clinton defeated Van
Buren's preferred candidate, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Buell_Porter"] Peter Buell Porter, in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_gubernatorial_election,_1817"] 1817 New York gubernatorial election.[48] Clinton
threw his influence behind the construction of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_Canal"] Erie Canal, an ambitious project designed to connect
 Lake Erie to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean"] Atlantic Ocean.[49] Though many of Van Buren's allies urged him to block Clinton's Erie
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hannah_van_buren_2.jpg"]
Page 6
Canal bill, Van Buren believed that the canal would benefit the state. His support for the bill helped it win
approval from the New York legislature.[50] Despite his support for the Erie Canal, Van Buren became the
leader of an anti-Clintonian faction in New York known as the "Bucktails".[51]
The Bucktails succeeded in emphasizing party loyalty and used it to capture and control many patronage
posts throughout New York. Through his use of patronage, loyal newspapers, and connections with local
party officials and leaders, Van Buren established what became known as the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_Regency"] Albany Regency", a
 political machine that emerged as an important factor in New York politics.[52] The Regency relied on a
coalition of small farmers, but also enjoyed support from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammany_Hall"] Tammany Hall machine in New York City.[53]
During this era, Van Buren largely determined Tammany Hall's political policy for New York's
Democratic-Republicans.[54]
A New York state referendum that expanded state voting rights to all white men in 1821, and which further
increased the power of Tammany Hall, was guided by Van Buren.[55] Although Governor Clinton
remained in office until late 1822, Van Buren emerged as the leader of the state's Democratic-Republicans
after the 1820 elections.[56] Van Buren was a member of the 1820 state [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_convention_(political_meeting)"] constitutional convention, where he
favored expanded voting rights, but opposed universal suffrage and tried to maintain property requirements
for voting.[57]
Entry into national politics
 In February 1821, the state legislature elected Van Buren to represent New York in the United States
Senate.[58] Van Buren arrived in Washington during the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_Good_Feelings"] Era of Good Feelings", a period in which partisan
distinctions at the national level had faded.[59] Van Buren quickly became a prominent figure in
 Washington, D.C., befriending Secretary of the Treasury [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Crawford"] William H. Crawford, among others.[60] Though
not an exceptional orator, Van Buren frequently spoke on the Senate floor, usually after extensively
researching the subject at hand. Despite his commitments as a father and state party leader, Van Buren
remained closely engaged in his legislative duties, and during his time in the Senate he served as the
chairman of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Finance"] Senate Finance Committee and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary"] Senate Judiciary Committee.[61] As he gained renown,
Van Buren earned monikers like "Little Magician" and "Sly Fox".[62]
Van Buren chose to back Crawford over [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams"] John Quincy Adams, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson"] Andrew Jackson, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay"] Henry Clay in the
 presidential election of 1824.[63] Crawford shared Van Buren's affinity for Jeffersonian principles of states'
rights and limited government, and Van Buren believed that Crawford was the ideal figure to lead a
coalition of New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia's "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Junto"] Richmond Junto".[64] Van Buren's support for
Crawford aroused strong opposition in New York in the form of the People's party, which drew support
from Clintonians, Federalists, and others opposed to Van Buren.[65] Nonetheless, Van Buren helped
Crawford win the Democratic-Republican party's presidential nomination at the February 1824
 congressional nominating caucus.[66] The other Democratic-Republican candidates in the race refused to
accept the poorly attended caucus's decision, and as the Federalist Party had all but ceased to function as a
national party, the 1824 campaign became a competition among four candidates of the same party. Though
Crawford suffered a severe [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke"] stroke that left him in poor health, Van Buren continued to support his chosen
candidate.[67] Van Buren met with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"] Thomas Jefferson in May 1824 in an attempt to bolster Crawford's
candidacy, and though he was unsuccessful in gaining a public endorsement for Crawford, he nonetheless
cherished the chance to meet with his political hero.[68]
The 1824 elections dealt a severe blow to the Albany Regency, as Clinton returned to the governorship
with the support of the People's party. By the time the state legislature convened to choose the state's
 presidential electors, results from other states had made it clear that no individual would win a majority of
the electoral vote, necessitating a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingent_election"] contingent election in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"] United States House of Representatives.[69]
While Adams and Jackson finished in the top three and were eligible for selection in the contingent
Page 7
election, New York's electors would help determine whether Clay or Crawford would finish third.[70]
Though most of the state's electoral votes went to Adams, Crawford won one more electoral vote than Clay
in the state, and Clay's defeat in Louisiana left Crawford in third place.[71] With Crawford still in the
running, Van Buren lobbied members of the House to support him.[72] He hoped to engineer a Crawford
victory on the second ballot of the contingent election, but Adams won on the first ballot with the help of
Clay and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Van_Rensselaer"] Stephen Van Rensselaer, a Congressman from New York. Despite his close ties with Van Buren,
Van Rensselaer cast his vote for Adams, thus giving Adams a narrow majority of New York's delegation
and a victory in the contingent election.[73]
After the House contest, Van Buren shrewdly kept out of the controversy which followed, and began
looking forward to 1828. Jackson was angered to see the presidency go to Adams despite having won
more popular votes than he had, and he eagerly looked forward to a rematch.[74] Jackson's supporters
accused Adams and Clay of having made a "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupt_bargain"] corrupt bargain" in which Clay helped Adams win the
contingent election in return for Clay's appointment as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State"] Secretary of State.[75] Van Buren was always
courteous in his treatment of opponents and showed no bitterness toward either Adams or Clay, and he
voted to confirm Clay's nomination to the cabinet.[76] At the same time, Van Buren opposed the Adams-
Clay plans for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_improvements"] internal improvements like roads and canals and declined to support U.S. participation in the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Panama"] Congress of Panama.[77] Van Buren considered Adams's proposals to represent a return to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Hamiltonian
economic model favored by Federalists, which he strongly opposed.[78] Despite his opposition to Adams's
public policies, Van Buren easily secured re-election in his divided home state in 1827.[79]
1828 elections
Van Buren's overarching goal at the national level was to restore a two-party system with party cleavages
based on philosophical differences, and he viewed the old divide between Federalists and Democratic-
Republicans as beneficial to the nation.[80] Van Buren believed that these national parties helped ensure that
elections were decided on national, rather than sectional or local, issues; as he put it, "party attachment in
former times furnished a complete antidote for sectional prejudices". After the 1824 election, Van Buren
was initially somewhat skeptical of Jackson, who had not taken strong positions on most policy issues.
 Nonetheless, he settled on Jackson as the one candidate who could beat Adams in the 1828 presidential
election, and he worked to bring Crawford's former backers into line behind Jackson.
He also forged alliances with other members of Congress opposed to Adams, including Vice President
 John C. Calhoun, Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hart_Benton_(politician)"] Thomas Hart Benton, and Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Randolph_of_Roanoke"] John Randolph.[81] Seeking to solidify his
 standing in New York and bolster Jackson's campaign, Van Buren helped arrange the passage of the Tariff
of 1828, which opponents labeled as the "Tariff of Abominations". The tariff satisfied many who sought
 protection from foreign competition, but angered Southern cotton interests and New Englanders.[82]
Because Van Buren believed that the South would never support Adams, and New England would never
support Jackson, he was willing to alienate both regions through passage of the tariff.[83]
Meanwhile, Clinton's death from a heart attack in 1828 dramatically shook up the politics of Van Buren's
home state, while the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Masonic_Party"] Anti-Masonic Party emerged as an increasingly important factor.[84] After some initial
reluctance, Van Buren chose to run for Governor of New York in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_gubernatorial_election,_1828"] 1828 election.[85] Hoping that a
Jackson victory would lead to his elevation to Secretary of State or Secretary of the Treasury, Van Buren
chose [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enos_T._Throop"] Enos T. Throop as his running mate and preferred successor.[86] Van Buren's candidacy was aided
by the split between supporters of Adams, who had adopted the label of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Republicans"] National Republicans, and the
Anti-Masonic Party.[87]
Reflecting his public association with Jackson, Van Buren accepted the gubernatorial nomination on a
ticket that called itself "Jacksonian-Democrat".[88] He campaigned on local as well as national issues,
emphasizing his opposition to the policies of the Adams administration.[89] Van Buren ran ahead of
Page 8
Jackson, winning the state by 30,000 votes compared to a margin of 5,000 for Jackson.[90] Nationally,
Jackson defeated Adams by a wide margin, winning nearly every state outside of New England.[91] After
the election, Van Buren resigned from the Senate to start his term as governor, which began on January 1,
1829.[92] While his term as governor was short, he did manage to pass the Bank Safety Fund Law, an early
form of deposit insurance, through the legislature.[93] He also appointed several key supporters, including
 William L. Marcy and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silas_Wright"] Silas Wright, to important state positions.[94]
Jackson administration (1829–1837)
Secretary of State
In February 1829, Jackson wrote to Van Buren to ask him to become
Secretary of State.[95] Van Buren quickly agreed, and he resigned as
governor the following month; his tenure of forty-three days is the
shortest of any Governor of New York.[96] No serious diplomatic
crises arose during Van Buren's tenure as Secretary of State, but he
achieved several notable successes, such as settling long-standing
claims against France and winning reparations for property that had
been seized during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars"] Napoleonic Wars. He reached an agreement
with the British to open trade with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_West_Indies"] British West Indies colonies and
concluded a treaty with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire"] Ottoman Empire that gained American
merchants access to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea"] Black Sea. Items on which he did not achieve
success included settling the Maine-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick"] New Brunswick boundary dispute
 with Great Britain, gaining settlement of the U.S. claim to the Oregon
Country, concluding a commercial treaty with Russia, and persuading
 Mexico to sell Texas.[97][98]
In addition to his foreign policy duties, Van Buren quickly emerged as
an important advisor to Jackson on major domestic issues like the tariff 
Mrs [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floride_Calhoun"] Floride Calhoun, a leader of
the "petticoats"
and internal improvements.[99] The Secretary of State was
instrumental in convincing Jackson to issue the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maysville_Road_veto"] Maysville Road veto, which both reaffirmed limited
government principles and also helped prevent the construction of infrastructure projects that could
potentially compete with New York's Erie Canal.[100] He also became involved in a power struggle with
Calhoun over appointments and other issues, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petticoat_Affair"] Petticoat Affair.[101] The Petticoat Affair arose
because [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Eaton"] Peggy Eaton, wife of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War"] Secretary of War [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_H._Eaton"] John H. Eaton, was ostracized by the other cabinet wives
due to the circumstances of her marriage.[102][103]
Led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floride_Calhoun"] Floride Calhoun, wife of Vice President John Calhoun, the other cabinet wives refused to pay
courtesy calls to the Eatons, receive them as visitors, or invite them to social events.[104] As a widower,
Van Buren was unaffected by the position of the cabinet wives.[105] Van Buren initially sought to mend the
divide in the cabinet, but most of the leading citizens in Washington continued to snub the Eatons.[106]
Jackson was close to Eaton, and he came to the conclusion that the allegations against Eaton arose from a
plot against his administration led by Henry Clay.[107] The Petticoat Affair, combined with a contentious
debate over the tariff and Calhoun's decade-old criticisms of Jackson's actions in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Seminole_War"] First Seminole War,
contributed to a split between Jackson and Calhoun.[108] As the debate over the tariff and the proposed
ability of South Carolina to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullification_(U.S._Constitution)"] nullify federal law consumed Washington, Van Buren increasingly emerged as
Jackson's likely successor.[109]
Page 9
The Petticoat affair was finally resolved when Van Buren offered to resign. In April 1831, Jackson
accepted and reorganized his cabinet by asking for the resignations of the anti-Eaton cabinet members.[110]
Postmaster General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_T._Barry"] William T. Barry, who had sided with the Eatons in the Petticoat Affair, was the lone
cabinet member to remain in office.[111] The cabinet reorganization removed Calhoun's allies from the
Jackson administration, and Van Buren had a major role in shaping the new cabinet.[112] After leaving
office, Van Buren continued to play a part in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_Cabinet"] Kitchen Cabinet, Jackson's informal circle of
advisors.[113]
Ambassador to Britain and vice-presidency
In August 1831, Jackson gave Van Buren a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recess_appointment"] recess appointment as the
 ambassador to Britain, and Van Buren arrived in London in
September.[114] He was cordially received, but in February 1832, he
learned that the Senate had rejected his nomination.[115] The rejection of
Van Buren was essentially the work of Calhoun.[116] When the vote on
Van Buren's nomination was taken, enough pro-Calhoun Jacksonians
refrained from voting to produce a tie, which allowed Calhoun to cast the
deciding vote against Van Buren.[117]
Calhoun was elated, convinced that he had ended Van Buren's career. "It
A painting of Van Buren by
 Francis Alexander, c. 1830 
will kill him dead, sir, kill him dead. He will never kick, sir, never kick",
Calhoun exclaimed to a friend.[118] Calhoun's move backfired; by
making Van Buren appear the victim of petty politics, Calhoun raised Van
Buren in both Jackson's regard and the esteem of others in the Democratic
Party. Far from ending Van Buren's career, Calhoun's action gave greater
impetus to Van Buren's candidacy for vice president.[119]
Seeking to ensure that Van Buren would replace Calhoun as his running mate, Jackson had arranged for a
national convention of his supporters.[120] The May 1832 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1832_Democratic_National_Convention"] Democratic National Convention subsequently
nominated Van Buren to serve as the party's vice presidential nominee.[121] Van Buren won the nomination
over [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_P._Barbour"] Philip P. Barbour (Calhoun's favored candidate) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Mentor_Johnson"] Richard Mentor Johnson due to the support of
Jackson and the strength of the Albany Regency.[122] Upon Van Buren's return from Europe in July 1832,
 he became involved in the Bank War, a struggle over the renewal of the charter of the Second Bank of the
United States.[123]
Van Buren had long been distrustful of banks, and he viewed the Bank as an extension of the Hamiltonian
economic program, so he supported Jackson's veto of the Bank's re-charter.[124] Henry Clay, the
presidential nominee of the National Republicans, made the struggle over the Bank the key issue of the
 presidential election of 1832.[125] The Jackson–Van Buren ticket won the 1832 election by a landslide,[126]
and Van Buren took office as vice president in March 1833.[127] During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullification_Crisis"] Nullification Crisis, Van Buren
counseled Jackson to pursue a policy of conciliation with South Carolina leaders.[128] He played little
direct role in the passage of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_1833"] Tariff of 1833, but he quietly hoped that the tariff would help bring an end
to the Nullification Crisis, which it did.[129]
As Vice President, Van Buren continued to be one of Jackson's primary advisors and confidants, and
accompanied Jackson on his tour of the northeastern United States in 1833.[130] Jackson's struggle with the
Second Bank of the United States continued, as the president sought to remove federal funds from the
Bank.[131] Though initially apprehensive of the removal due to congressional support for the Bank, Van
Buren eventually came to support Jackson's policy.[132] He also helped undermine a fledgling alliance
between Jackson and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Webster"] Daniel Webster, a senator from Massachusetts who could have potentially threatened
Page 10
Van Buren's project to create two parties separated by policy differences rather than personalities.[133]
During Jackson's second term, the president's supporters began to refer to themselves as members of the
Democratic Party. Meanwhile, those opposed to Jackson, including Clay's National Republicans, followers
 of Calhoun and Webster, and many members of the Anti-Masonic Party, coalesced into the Whig
Party.[134]
Presidential election of 1836
President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson"] Andrew Jackson declined to seek another term in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1836_United_States_presidential_election"] 1836 presidential election, but he remained
influential within the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Democratic_Party"] Democratic Party as his second term came to an end. Jackson was determined to help
elect Van Buren in 1836 so that the latter could continue the Jackson administration's policies. The two men
—the charismatic "Old Hickory" and the efficient "Sly Fox"—had entirely different personalities but had
become an effective team in eight years in office together.[135] With Jackson's support, Van Buren won the
presidential nomination of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1835_Democratic_National_Convention"] 1835 Democratic National Convention without opposition.[136] Two names
were put forward for the vice-presidential nomination: Representative [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_M._Johnson"] Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky,
and former Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Cabell_Rives"] William Cabell Rives of Virginia. Southern Democrats, and Van Buren himself,
strongly preferred Rives. Jackson, on the other hand, strongly preferred Johnson. Again, Jackson's
considerable influence prevailed, and Johnson received the required two-thirds vote after New York
Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silas_Wright"] Silas Wright prevailed upon non-delegate Edward Rucker to cast the 15 votes of the absent
Tennessee delegation in Johnson's favor.[137][136]
Van Buren's competitors in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1836_United_States_presidential_election"] election of 1836 were three
members of the Whig Party, which remained a loose coalition
bound by mutual opposition to Jackson's anti-bank policies.
Lacking the party unity or organizational strength to field a
single ticket or define a single platform,[137] the Whigs ran
several regional candidates in hopes of sending the election to
the House of Representatives.[138] The three candidates were
 Hugh Lawson White of Tennessee, Daniel Webster of
Massachusetts, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison"] William Henry Harrison of Indiana.
Besides endorsing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_improvements"] internal improvements and a national bank,
the Whigs tried to tie Democrats to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States"] abolitionism and sectional
tension, and attacked Jackson for "acts of aggression and
usurpation of power".[139]
Southern voters represented the biggest potential impediment 1836 electoral vote results
to Van Buren's quest for the presidency, as many were
apprehensive at the prospect of a Northern president.[140] Van
Buren moved to obtain their support by assuring them that he opposed abolitionism and supported
maintaining slavery in states where it already existed.[141] To demonstrate consistency regarding his
opinions on slavery, Van Buren cast the tie-breaking Senate vote for a bill to subject abolitionist mail to
state laws, thus ensuring that its circulation would be prohibited in the South.[142] Van Buren considered
slavery to be immoral but sanctioned by the Constitution.[143]
Van Buren won the election with 764,198 popular votes, 50.9% of the total, and 170 electoral votes.
 Harrison led the Whigs with 73 electoral votes, White receiving 26, and Webster 14.[139] Willie Person
Mangum received South Carolina's 11 electoral votes, which were awarded by the state legislature.[144]
Van Buren's victory resulted from a combination of his attractive political and personal qualities, Jackson's
popularity and endorsement, the organizational power of the Democratic Party, and the inability of the
Whig Party to muster an effective candidate and campaign.[145] Virginia's presidential electors voted for
Page 11
Van Buren for president, but voted for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Smith_(South_Carolina_senator)"] William Smith for vice president, leaving Johnson one electoral vote
short of election.[146] In accordance with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] Twelfth Amendment, the Senate elected Johnson vice
president in a contingent vote.[147]
The election of 1836 marked an important turning point in American political history because it saw the
establishment of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Party_System"] Second Party System. In the early 1830s, the political party structure was still
changing, rapidly, and factional and personal leaders continued to play a major role in politics. By the end
of the campaign of 1836, the new party system was almost complete, as nearly every faction had been
absorbed by either the Democrats or the Whigs.[148]
Presidency (1837–1841)
Cabinet
Van Buren retained much of Jackson's cabinet and lower-level
appointees, as he hoped that the retention of Jackson's appointees
would stop Whig momentum in the South and restore confidence
in the Democrats as a party of sectional unity.[149] The cabinet
holdovers represented the different regions of the country:
Secretary of the Treasury [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Woodbury"] Levi Woodbury came from New
England, Attorney General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_F._Butler"] Benjamin F. Butler and Secretary of
the Navy [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahlon_Dickerson"] Mahlon Dickerson hailed from mid-Atlantic states,
Secretary of State [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forsyth_(Georgia)"] John Forsyth represented the South, and
Postmaster General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Kendall"] Amos Kendall of Kentucky represented the
West.
For the lone open position of Secretary of War, Van Buren first
approached William Cabell Rives, who had sought the vice
presidency in 1836. After Rives declined to join the cabinet, Van
Buren appointed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Roberts_Poinsett"] Joel Roberts Poinsett, a South Carolinian who
had opposed secession during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullification_Crisis"] Nullification Crisis. Van Buren's
 cabinet choices were criticized by Pennsylvanians such as James
Buchanan, who argued that their state deserved a cabinet position
as well as some Democrats who argued that Van Buren should
have used his patronage powers to augment his power. However,
Van Buren saw value in avoiding contentious patronage battles,
and his decision to retain Jackson's cabinet made it clear that he
intended to continue the policies of his predecessor. Additionally,
Van Buren had helped select Jackson's cabinet appointees and
enjoyed strong working relationships with them.[150]

president to reserve judgment and protect his prerogative for making final decisions. These open
discussions gave cabinet members a sense of participation and made them feel part of a functioning entity,
Page 12
rather than isolated executive agents.[151] Van Buren was closely involved in foreign affairs and matters
pertaining to the Treasury Department; but the Post Office, War Department, and Navy Department had
significant autonomy under their respective cabinet secretaries.[152]
Panic of 1837 
When Van Buren entered office,
the nation's economic health had
taken a turn for the worse and the
prosperity of the early 1830s was
over. Two months into his
presidency, on May 10, 1837,
some important state banks in
New York, running out of hard
currency reserves, refused to
convert paper money into gold or
silver, and other financial

institutions throughout the nation
quickly followed suit. This
 financial crisis would become
known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1837"] Panic of 1837.[153]
The Panic was followed by a five-year [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(economics)"] depression in which banks
failed and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment"] unemployment reached record highs.[154]

comments approvingly
Van Buren blamed the economic collapse on greedy American and foreign business and financial
institutions, as well as the over-extension of credit by U.S. banks. Whig leaders in Congress blamed the
Democrats, along with Andrew Jackson's economic policies,[153] specifically his 1836 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specie_Circular"] Specie Circular.
Cries of "rescind the circular!" went up and former president Jackson sent word to Van Buren asking him
not to rescind the order, believing that it had to be given enough time to work. Others, like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Biddle_(banker)"] Nicholas Biddle,
believed that Jackson's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_War#Jackson's_dismantling_of_the_BUS"] dismantling of the Bank of the United States was directly responsible for the
irresponsible creation of paper money by the state banks which had precipitated this panic.[155] The Panic
of 1837 loomed large over the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_elections,_1838"] 1838 election cycle, as the carryover effects of the economic downturn led
to Whig gains in both the U.S. House and Senate. The state elections in 1837 and 1838 were also
disastrous for the Democrats,[156] and the partial economic recovery in 1838 was offset by a second
commercial crisis later that year.[157]
To address the crisis, the Whigs proposed rechartering the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_central_banking_in_the_United_States"] national bank. The president countered by
proposing the establishment of an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Treasury"] independent U.S. treasury, which he contended would take the politics
out of the nation's money supply. Under the plan, the government would hold its money in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_money_(policy)"] gold or silver,
and would be restricted from printing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknote"] paper money at will; both measures were designed to prevent
inflation.[158] The plan would permanently separate the government from private banks by storing
government funds in government vaults rather than in private banks.[159] Van Buren announced his
proposal in September 1837,[153] but an alliance of conservative Democrats and Whigs prevented it from
becoming law until 1840.[160] As the debate continued, conservative Democrats like Rives defected to the
Whig Party, which itself grew more unified in its opposition to Van Buren.[161] The Whigs would abolish
the Independent Treasury system in 1841, but it was revived in 1846, and remained in place until the
passage of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Act"] Federal Reserve Act in 1913.[162] More important for Van Buren's immediate future, the
depression would be a major issue in his upcoming re-election campaign.[153]
Indian removal
Page 13
Federal policy under Jackson had sought to move Indian tribes to lands west of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River"] Mississippi River
through the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Removal_Act_of_1830"] Indian Removal Act of 1830, and the federal government negotiated 19 treaties with Indian
tribes during Van Buren's presidency.[163] The 1835 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_New_Echota"] Treaty of New Echota signed by government officials
and representatives of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee"] Cherokee tribe had established terms under which the Cherokees ceded their
territory in the southeast and agreed to move west to Oklahoma. In 1838, Van Buren directed General
 Winfield Scott to forcibly move all those who had not yet complied with the treaty.[164]
The Cherokees were herded violently into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_camp"] internment camps where they were kept for the summer of 1838.
The actual transportation west was delayed by intense heat and drought, but in the fall, the Cherokee
reluctantly agreed to transport themselves west.[165][166] Some 20,000 people were relocated against their
will during the Cherokee removal, part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears"] Trail of Tears.[167] Notably, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson"] Ralph Waldo Emerson, who
would go on to become America's foremost man of letters, wrote Van Buren [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson%27s_letter_to_Martin_Van_Buren"] a letter protesting his treatment
of the Cherokee.[168]
The administration also contended with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole"] Seminole Indians, who
 engaged the army in a prolonged conflict known as the Second
Seminole War.[163] Before he left office, Jackson put General
 Thomas Jesup in command of all military troops in Florida to force
Seminole emigration to the West.[169] Forts were established
throughout the Indian territory, and mobile columns of soldiers
scoured the countryside, and many Seminoles offered to surrender,
including Chief Micanopy. The Seminoles slowly gathered for
emigration near Tampa, but in June they fled the detention camps,
driven off by disease and the presence of slave catchers hoping to
capture [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Seminole"] Black Seminoles.[170][171]

In December 1837, Jesup began a massive offensive, culminating
in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Lake_Okeechobee"] Battle of Lake Okeechobee, and the war entered a new phase of attrition.[170] During this time, the
government realized that it would be almost impossible to drive the remaining Seminoles from Florida, so
Van Buren sent General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Macomb_(general)"] Alexander Macomb to negotiate peace with them. It was the only time that an
Indian tribe had forced the government to sue for peace. An agreement was reached allowing the
Seminoles to remain in southwest Florida, but the peace was shattered in July 1839 and was not restored
until 1842, after Van Buren had left office.[170][172]
Texas
 Just before leaving office in March 1837, Andrew Jackson extended diplomatic recognition to the Republic
of Texas, which had won independence from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"] Mexico in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Revolution"] Texas Revolution. By suggesting the prospect
of quick annexation, Jackson raised the danger of war with Mexico and heightened sectional tensions at
home. New England abolitionists charged that there was a "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_Power"] slaveholding conspiracy to acquire Texas", and
 Daniel Webster eloquently denounced annexation.[173] Many Southern leaders, meanwhile, strongly
desired the expansion of slave-holding territory in the United States.[174]
Boldly reversing Jackson's policies, Van Buren sought peace abroad and harmony at home. He proposed a
diplomatic solution to a long-standing financial dispute between American citizens and the Mexican
government, rejecting Jackson's threat to settle it by force.[173] Likewise, when the Texas minister at
Washington, D.C.,  proposed annexation to the administration in August 1837, he was told that the
proposition could not be entertained. Constitutional scruples and fear of war with Mexico were the reasons
given for the rejection,[175] but concern that it would precipitate a clash over the extension of slavery
undoubtedly influenced Van Buren and continued to be the chief obstacle to annexation.[176] Northern and
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation"]

Southern Democrats followed an unspoken rule: Northerners helped quash anti-slavery proposals and
Southerners refrained from agitating for the annexation of Texas.[174] Texas withdrew the annexation offer
in 1838.[175]

British subjects in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Canada"] Lower Canada (now Quebec) and
 Upper Canada (now Ontario) rose in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebellion"] rebellion in 1837
 and 1838, protesting their lack of responsible
government. While the initial insurrection in Upper
Canada ended quickly (following the December 1837
 Battle of Montgomery's Tavern), many of the rebels
fled across the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_River"] Niagara River into New York, and
Canadian leader [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lyon_Mackenzie"] William Lyon Mackenzie began
recruiting volunteers in Buffalo.[177] Mackenzie
declared the establishment of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Canada"] Republic of Canada
and put into motion a plan whereby volunteers would
invade Upper Canada from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Island"] Navy Island on the
Canadian side of the Niagara River. Several hundred 
"Destruction of the Caroline", illustration by John
Charles Dent (1881)
volunteers traveled to Navy Island in the weeks that
 followed. They procured the steamboat Caroline to deliver supplies to Navy Island from Fort
Schlosser.[177] Seeking to deter an imminent invasion, British forces crossed to the American bank of the
river in late December 1837, and they burned and sank the Caroline. In the melee, one American was
killed and others were wounded.[178]
Considerable sentiment arose within the United States to declare war, and a British ship was burned in
revenge.[179] Van Buren, looking to avoid a war with Great Britain, sent General Winfield Scott to the
 Canada–United States border with large discretionary powers for its protection and its peace.[180] Scott
impressed upon American citizens the need for a peaceful resolution to the crisis, and made it clear that the
U.S. government would not support adventuresome Americans attacking the British. Also, in early
January 1838, the president proclaimed U.S. neutrality in the Canadian independence issue,[181] a
declaration which Congress endorsed by passing a neutrality law designed to discourage the participation
of American citizens in foreign conflicts.[179]
During the Canadian rebellions, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Duncombe_(Upper_Canada_Rebellion)"] Charles Duncombe and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Nelson_(insurrectionist)"] Robert Nelson helped foment a largely American
militia, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunters%27_Lodges"] Hunters' Lodge/[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A8res_chasseurs"] Frères chasseurs. This militia carried out several attacks in Upper Canada
between December 1837 and December 1838, collectively known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_War"] Patriot War. The administration
followed through on its enforcement of the Neutrality Act, encouraged the prosecution of filibusters, and
actively deterred U.S. citizens from subversive activities abroad. In the long term, Van Buren's opposition
 to the Patriot War contributed to the construction of healthy Anglo-American and Canada–United States
relations in the 20th century; it also led, more immediately, to a backlash among citizens regarding the
seeming overreach of federal authority,[182] which hurt congressional Democrats in the 1838 midterm
elections.
A new crisis surfaced in late 1838, in the disputed territory on the Maine–[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Brunswick"] New Brunswick frontier, where
Americans were settling on long-disputed land claimed by the United States and Great Britain.[183] Jackson
had been willing to drop American claims to the region in return for other concessions, but Maine was
unwilling to drop its claims to the disputed territory. The British considered possession of the area vital to
the defense of Canada.[184] Both American and New Brunswick [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumberjack"] lumberjacks cut timber in the disputed
territory during the winter of 1838–1839. On December 29, New Brunswick lumbermen were spotted
cutting down trees on an American estate near the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aroostook_River"] Aroostook River.[179]
Page 15
After American woodcutters rushed to stand guard, a shouting match, known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Caribou"] Battle of Caribou,
ensued. Tensions quickly boiled over into a near war with both Maine and New Brunswick arresting each
other's citizens. The crisis seemed ready to turn into an armed conflict.[185] British troops began to gather
along the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John_River_(Bay_of_Fundy)"] Saint John River. Governor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fairfield"] John Fairfield mobilized the state militia to confront the British in the
disputed territory[186] and several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockhouse"] forts were constructed.[187] The American press clamored for war;
"Maine and her soil, or BLOOD!" screamed one editorial. "Let the sword be drawn and the scabbard
thrown away!" In June, Congress authorized 50,000 troops and a $10 million budget[188] in the event
foreign military troops crossed into United States territory.
Van Buren was unwilling to go to war over the disputed territory, though he assured Maine that he would
 respond to any attacks by the British.[189] To settle the crisis, Van Buren met with the British minister to the
United States, and Van Buren and the minister agreed to resolve the border issue diplomatically.[186] Van
Buren also sent General Scott to the northern border area, both to show military resolve, and more
importantly, to lower the tensions. Scott successfully convinced all sides to submit the border issue to
 arbitration. The border dispute was put to rest a few years later, with the signing of the 1842 Webster–
Ashburton Treaty.[179][181]
Amistad case
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._The_Amistad"] Amistad case was a freedom suit that involved international issues and parties, as well as United States
law, resulting from the rebellion of Africans on board the Spanish schooner [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Amistad"] La Amistad in 1839.[190] Van
Buren viewed abolitionism as the greatest threat to the nation's unity, and he resisted the slightest
interference with slavery in the states where it existed.[191] His administration supported the Spanish
government's demand that the ship and its cargo (including the Africans) be turned over to them.[192] A
federal district court judge ruled that the Africans were legally free and should be transported home, but
Van Buren's administration appealed the case to the Supreme Court.
In February 1840, former president [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams"] John Quincy Adams argued passionately for the Africans' right to
freedom, and Attorney General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_D._Gilpin"] Henry D. Gilpin presented the government's case. In March 1841, the
Supreme Court issued its final verdict: the Amistad Africans were free people and should be allowed to
return home.[193] The unique nature of the case heightened public interest in the saga, including the
participation of former president Adams, Africans testifying in federal court, and their representation by
prominent lawyers. The Amistad case drew attention to the personal tragedies of slavery and attracted new
support for the growing abolition movement in the North. It also transformed the courts into the principal
forum for a national debate on the legal foundations of slavery.[194]
Judicial appointments
Van Buren appointed two Associate Justices to the Supreme Court:[195] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McKinley"] John McKinley, confirmed
September 25, 1837, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Vivian_Daniel"] Peter Vivian Daniel, confirmed March 2, 1841. He also appointed eight other
federal judges, all to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court"] United States district courts.[196]
White House hostess
For the first half of his presidency, Van Buren, who had been a widower for many years, did not have a
specific person to act as White House hostess at administration social events, but tried to assume such duties
himself. When his eldest son [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Van_Buren"] Abraham Van Buren married [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelica_Singleton_Van_Buren"] Angelica Singleton in 1838, he quickly acted to
 install his daughter-in-law as his hostess. She solicited the advice of her distant relative, Dolley
Madison,[197] who had moved back to Washington after her [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] husband's death,[198] and soon the president's
Page 16
parties livened up. After the 1839 New Year's Eve reception, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Post"] The Boston Post raved: "[Angelica Van
Buren is a] lady of rare accomplishments, very modest yet perfectly easy and graceful in her manners and
free and vivacious in her conversation ... universally admired."[197]
As the nation endured a deep [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_depression"] economic depression, Angelica Van Buren's receiving style at receptions was
influenced by her heavy reading about European court life (and her naive delight in being received as the
Queen of the United States when she visited the royal courts of England and France after her marriage).
Newspaper coverage of this, and the claim that she intended to re-landscape the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lawn_(White_House)"] White House grounds to
resemble the royal gardens of Europe, was used in a political attack on her father-in-law by a Pennsylvania
Whig Congressman [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ogle_(politician)"] Charles Ogle. He referred obliquely to her as part of the presidential "household" in his
famous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Spoon_Oration"] Gold Spoon Oration. The attack was delivered in Congress and the depiction of the president as
living a royal lifestyle was a primary factor in his defeat for re-election.[199]
Presidential election of 1840
Van Buren easily won renomination for a second term at the
 1840 Democratic National Convention, but he and his party
faced a difficult [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1840_United_States_presidential_election"] election in 1840. Van Buren's presidency had
been a difficult affair, with the U.S. economy mired in a severe
downturn, and other divisive issues, such as slavery, western
expansion, and tensions with Great Britain, providing
opportunities for Van Buren's political opponents—including
some of his fellow Democrats—to criticize his actions.[145]
Although Van Buren's renomination was never in doubt,
Democratic strategists began to question the wisdom of
keeping Johnson on the ticket. Even former president Jackson
conceded that Johnson was a liability and insisted on former
House Speaker [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_K._Polk"] James K. Polk of Tennessee as Van Buren's
new running mate. Van Buren was reluctant to drop Johnson,
who was popular with workers and radicals in the North[200] 
1840 electoral vote results
and added military experience to the ticket, which might prove
important against likely Whig nominee [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Harrison"] William Henry Harrison.[137] Rather than re-nominating Johnson,
the Democratic convention decided to allow state Democratic Party leaders to select the vice-presidential
candidates for their states.[201]
Van Buren hoped that the Whigs would nominate Clay for president, which would allow Van Buren to cast
the 1840 campaign as a clash between Van Buren's Independent Treasury system and Clay's support for a
national bank. However, rather than nominating longtime party spokesmen like Clay and Daniel Webster,
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1839_Whig_National_Convention"] 1839 Whig National Convention nominated Harrison, who had served in various governmental
positions during his career and had earned fame for his military leadership in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tippecanoe"] Battle of Tippecanoe and
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812"] War of 1812. Whig leaders like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Seward"] William Seward and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaddeus_Stevens"] Thaddeus Stevens believed that Harrison's war
record would effectively counter the popular appeals of the Democratic Party. For vice president, the Whigs
nominated former Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyler"] John Tyler of Virginia. Clay was deeply disappointed by his defeat at the
convention, but he nonetheless threw his support behind Harrison.[202]
Whigs presented Harrison as the antithesis of the president, whom they derided as ineffective, corrupt, and
effete.[145] Whigs also depicted Van Buren as an aristocrat living in high style in the White House, while
they used images of Harrison in a log cabin sipping cider to convince voters that he was a man of the
people.[203] They threw such jabs as "Van, Van, is a used-up man" and "Martin Van Ruin" and ridiculed
him in newspapers and cartoons.[204] Issues of policy were not absent from the campaign; the Whigs
derided the alleged executive overreaches of Jackson and Van Buren, while also calling for a national bank
Page 17
and higher tariffs.[205] Democrats attempted to campaign on the Independent Treasury system, but the onset
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation"] deflation undercut these arguments.[206] The enthusiasm for "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tippecanoe_and_Tyler_Too"] Tippecanoe and Tyler Too", coupled with
the country's severe economic crisis, made it impossible for Van Buren to win a second term.[203] Harrison
won by a popular vote of 1,275,612 to 1,130,033, and an electoral vote margin of 234 to 60.[139] An
astonishing 80% of eligible voters went to the polls on election day.[145] Van Buren actually won more
votes than he had in 1836, but the Whig success in attracting new voters more than canceled out
Democratic gains.[207] Additionally, Whigs won majorities for the first time in both the House of
Representatives and the Senate.[137]
Post-presidency (1841–1862)
Election of 1844
On the expiration of his term, Van Buren returned to his estate of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindenwald"] Lindenwald in Kinderhook.[208] He
continued to closely watch political developments, including the battle between Clay and President Tyler,
who took office after Harrison's death in April 1841.[209] Though undecided on another presidential run,
Van Buren made several moves calculated to maintain his support, including a trip to the South and West
during which he met with Jackson, former Speaker of the House [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_K._Polk"] James K. Polk, and others.[210] President
Tyler, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Buchanan"] James Buchanan, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Woodbury"] Levi Woodbury, and others loomed as potential challengers for the
1844 Democratic nomination, but it was Calhoun who posed the most formidable obstacle.[211]
Van Buren remained silent on major public issues like the debate over the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_1842"] Tariff of 1842, hoping to arrange
for the appearance of a draft movement for his presidential candidacy.[212] President John Tyler made the
annexation of Texas his chief foreign policy goal, and many Democrats, particularly in the South, were
anxious to quickly complete the annexation of Texas.[213] After an explosion on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Princeton_(1843)"] USS Princeton killed
Secretary of State [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_P._Upshur"] Abel P. Upshur in February 1844, Tyler brought Calhoun into his cabinet to direct
foreign affairs.[214] Like Tyler, Calhoun pursued the annexation of Texas to upend the presidential race and
to extend slavery into new territories.[215]
Shortly after taking office, Secretary of State Calhoun negotiated an annexation treaty between the United
States and Texas.[216] Van Buren had hoped he would not have to take a public stand on annexation, but as
the Texas question came to dominate U.S. politics, he decided to make his views on the issue public.[217]
Though he believed that his public acceptance of annexation would likely help him win the 1844
Democratic nomination, Van Buren thought that annexation would inevitably lead to an unjust war with
Mexico.[218] In a public letter published shortly after Henry Clay also announced his opposition to the
annexation treaty, Van Buren articulated his views on the Texas question.[219]
Van Buren's opposition to immediate annexation cost him the support of many pro-slavery Democrats.[220]
In the weeks before the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1844_Democratic_National_Convention"] 1844 Democratic National Convention, Van Buren's supporters anticipated that he
would win a majority of the delegates on the first presidential ballot, but would not be able to win the
support of the required two-thirds of delegates.[221] Van Buren's supporters attempted to prevent the
adoption of the two-thirds rule, but several Northern delegates joined with Southern delegates in
implementing the two-thirds rule for the 1844 convention.[222] Van Buren won 146 of the 266 votes on the
first presidential ballot, with only 12 of his votes coming from Southern states.[213]
Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Cass"] Lewis Cass won much of the remaining vote, and he gradually picked up support on subsequent
ballots until the convention adjourned for the day.[223] When the convention reconvened and held another
ballot, James K. Polk, who shared many of Van Buren's views but favored immediate annexation, won
44 votes.[224] On the ninth and final ballot of the convention, Van Buren's supporters withdrew the former
Page 18
president's name from consideration, and Polk won the Democratic presidential nomination.[225] Although
angered that his opponents had denied him in the nomination, Van Buren endorsed Polk in the interest of
party unity.[226] He also convinced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silas_Wright"] Silas Wright to run for Governor of New York so that the popular
Wright could help boost Polk in the state.[227] Wright narrowly defeated Whig nominee [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millard_Fillmore"] Millard Fillmore in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_state_election,_1844"] 1844 gubernatorial election, and Wright's victory in the state helped Polk narrowly defeat Henry Clay in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1844_United_States_presidential_election"] 1844 presidential election.[228]
After taking office, Polk used [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bancroft"] George Bancroft as an intermediary to offer Van Buren the ambassadorship
to London. Van Buren declined, partly because he was upset with Polk over the treatment the Van Buren
delegates had received at the 1844 convention, and partly because he was content in his retirement.[229]
Polk also consulted Van Buren in the formation of his cabinet, but offended Van Buren by offering to
appoint a New Yorker only to the lesser post of Secretary of War, rather than as Secretary of State or
Secretary of the Treasury.[230] Other patronage decisions also angered Van Buren and Wright, and they
became permanently alienated from the Polk administration.[231]
Election of 1848
Though he had previously helped maintain a balance between the
 Barnburners and Hunkers, the two factions of the New York Democratic
Party, Van Buren moved closer to the Barnburners after the 1844
Democratic National Convention.[232] The split in the state party
worsened during Polk's presidency, as his administration lavished
patronage on the Hunkers.[233] In his retirement, Van Buren also grew
increasingly opposed to slavery.[234]
As the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War"] Mexican–American War brought the debate over slavery in the
territories to the forefront of American politics, Van Buren published an
anti-slavery manifesto. In it, he refuted the notion that Congress did not
have the power to regulate slavery in the territories, and argued the
 Founding Fathers had favored the eventual [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States"] abolition of slavery.[235] The
document, which became known as the "Barnburner Manifesto," was
edited at Van Buren's request by John Van Buren and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Tilden"] Samuel Tilden,
both of whom were leaders of the Barnburner faction.[236] After the 
 Daguerreotype of Van Buren
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Brady"] Mathew Brady, c. 1849–50
publication of the Barnburner Manifesto, many Barnburners urged the
 former president to seek his old office in the 1848 presidential election.[237] The 1848 Democratic National
Convention seated competing Barnburner and Hunker delegations from New York, but the Barnburners
walked out of the convention when Lewis Cass, who opposed congressional regulation of slavery in the
territories, was nominated on the fourth ballot.[238]
In response to the nomination of Cass, the Barnburners began to organize as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_party_(United_States)"] third party. At a convention
held in June 1848, in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_New_York"] Utica, New York, the Barnburners nominated Van Buren for president.[239] Though
reluctant to bolt from the Democratic Party, Van Buren accepted the nomination to show the power of the
 anti-slavery movement, help defeat Cass, and weaken the Hunkers.[240] At a convention held in Buffalo,
New York in August 1848, a group of anti-slavery Democrats, Whigs, and members of the abolitionist
 Liberty Party met in the first national convention of what became known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Soil_Party"] Free Soil Party.[241]
The convention unanimously nominated Van Buren, and chose [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Francis_Adams_Sr."] Charles Francis Adams as Van Buren's
running mate. In a public message accepting the nomination, Van Buren gave his full support for the
 Wilmot Proviso, a proposed law that would ban slavery in all territories acquired from Mexico in the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Martin_Van_Buren_daguerreotype_by_Mathew_Brady_circa_1849_-_edit_1.jpg"]
Page 19
Mexican–American War.[241] Anti-slavery Whig orator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Webster"] Daniel Webster, in his "Marshfield Speech,"
expressed skepticism, in terms that may have influenced Whig voters, about the sincerity of Van Buren's
espousal of the anti-slavery cause:
In Mr. Van Buren's anti-slavery professions, Mr. Webster had no confidence. He said
pleasantly, but significantly, that "if he and Mr. Van Buren should meet under the Free-soil
flag, the latter with his accustomed good-nature would laugh." He added, with a touch of
characteristic humor, "that the leader of the Free-spoil party suddenly becoming the leader of
the Free-soil party is a joke to shake his sides and mine."[242]
Van Buren won no electoral votes, but finished second to Whig nominee [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary_Taylor"] Zachary Taylor in New York,
taking enough votes from Cass to give the state—and perhaps the election—to Taylor.[243] Nationwide,
Van Buren won 10.1% of the popular vote, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_third_party_performances_in_United_States_presidential_elections"] strongest showing by a third-party presidential nominee up
to that point in U.S. history.
Retirement
Van Buren never sought public office again after the 1848 election, but he
continued to closely follow national politics. He was deeply troubled by
 the stirrings of secessionism in the South and welcomed the Compromise
of 1850 as a necessary conciliatory measure despite his opposition to the
 Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.[244] Van Buren also worked on a history of
American political parties and embarked on a tour of Europe, becoming
the first former American head of state to visit Britain.[245] Though still
concerned about slavery, Van Buren and his followers returned to the
Democratic fold, partly out of the fear that a continuing Democratic split
would help the Whig Party.[246] He also attempted to reconcile the
Barnburners and the Hunkers, with mixed results.[247]
Van Buren supported [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Pierce"] Franklin Pierce for president in 1852,[248] James
Buchanan in 1856,[249] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Douglas"] Stephen A. Douglas in 1860.[250] Van Buren 
 Daguerreotype of Martin Van
Buren, circa 1855
viewed the fledgling [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_Nothing"] Know Nothing movement with contempt and felt
that the anti-slavery [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"] Republican Party exacerbated sectional tensions.[251] He considered Chief Justice
 Roger Taney's ruling in the 1857 case of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford"] Dred Scott v. Sandford to be a "grievous mistake" since it
overturned the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Compromise"] Missouri Compromise.[252] He believed that the Buchanan administration handled the issue
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_Kansas"] Bleeding Kansas poorly, and saw the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecompton_Constitution"] Lecompton Constitution as a sop to Southern extremists.[253]
After the election of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln"] Abraham Lincoln and the secession of several Southern states in 1860, Van Buren
unsuccessfully sought to call a constitutional convention.[250] In April 1861, former president Pierce wrote
to the other living former presidents and asked them to consider meeting to use their stature and influence to
propose a negotiated end to the war. Pierce asked Van Buren to use his role as the senior living ex-president
to issue a formal call. Van Buren's reply suggested that Buchanan should be the one to call the meeting,
since he was the former president who had served most recently, or that Pierce should issue the call himself
if he strongly believed in the merit of his proposal. Neither Buchanan nor Pierce was willing to make
Pierce's proposal public, and nothing more resulted from it.[254] Once the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"] American Civil War began, Van
Buren made public his support for the Union.[255]
Death
Page 20
Van Buren's health began to fail later in 1861, and he was bedridden with
 pneumonia during the fall and winter of 1861–1862.[256] He died of
bronchial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma"] asthma and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"] heart failure at his Lindenwald estate at 2:00 a.m.
 on July 24, 1862, at 79.[257] He is buried in the Kinderhook Reformed
Dutch Church Cemetery, as are his wife Hannah, his parents, and his son
Martin Van Buren Jr.[258]
Van Buren outlived all four of his immediate successors: Harrison, Tyler,
Polk, and Taylor.[259] In addition, he saw more successors ascend to the
presidency than anyone else (eight),  living to see Abraham Lincoln
elected as the 16th President before his death.[260]

Van Buren's most lasting achievement was as a political organizer who built the Democratic Party and
guided it to dominance in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Party_System"] Second Party System,[261] and historians have come to regard Van Buren as
integral to the development of the American political system.[29] According to historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_V._Remini"] Robert V. Remini:
Van Buren's creative contribution to the political development of the nation was enormous, and
as such he earned his way to the presidency. After gaining control of New York's Republican
Party he organized the Albany Regency to run the state in his absence while he pursued a
national career in Washington. The Regency was a governing consul in Albany consisting of a
group of politically astute and highly intelligent men. He was one of the first statewide political
machines in the country was success resulted from its professional use of patronage, the
legislative caucus, and the official party newspaper.....[In Washington] he labored to bring
about the reorganization of the Republican Party through an alliance between what he called
"the planters of the South and the plain Republicans of the North."...  [His Democratic]
emphasized the importance of building popular majorities and it perfected political techniques
which would appeal to the masses....Heretofore parties were regarded as evils to be tolerated;
Van Buren argued that the party system was the most sensible and intelligent way the affairs of
the nation could be democratically conducted, a viewpoint that eventually won national
approval.[262]
However, his presidency is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States"] considered to be average, at best, by historians. He was blamed for the Panic of
1837 and defeated for reelection.[29] His tenure was dominated by the economic conditions caused by the
panic, and historians have split on the adequacy of the Independent Treasury as a response.[263] Some
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recarving_Rushmore"] historians disagree with these negative assessments. For example, Ivan Eland in his book Recarving
Rushmore, ranked Van Buren as the third greatest president in American history.[264][265] He argues that
 Van Buren allowed the market to readjust fairly quickly after the Panic of 1837, reduced government
spending, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_budget"] balanced the budget, and avoided potential wars with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"] Canada and Mexico.[264][265] Historian
Jeffrey Rogers Hummel states that Van Buren was America's greatest president, arguing that "historians
have grossly underrated his many remarkable accomplishments in the face of heavy odds".[266]
Several writers have portrayed Van Buren as among the nation's most obscure presidents. As noted in a
2014 Time magazine article on the "Top 10 Forgettable Presidents":
Page 21
Making himself nearly disappear completely from the history
books was probably not the trick the "Little Magician"
Martin Van Buren had in mind, but his was the first truly
forgettable American presidency.[267]

Popular culture 
Gubernatorial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait"] portrait of Martin
 Van Buren by Daniel
Huntington in The Civil War
Cartoons
During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_United_States_presidential_election"] 1988 presidential campaign, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush"] George H. W. Bush, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University"] Yale University graduate and member of the
 Skull and Bones secret society, was attempting to become the first incumbent vice president to win election
to the presidency since Van Buren. In the comic strip [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doonesbury"] Doonesbury, artist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Trudeau"] Garry Trudeau depicted members
of Skull and Bones as attempting to rob Van Buren's grave, apparently intending to use the relics in a ritual
that would aid Bush in the election.[270][271]
Currency
Martin Van Buren appeared in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_dollar_coins"] Presidential dollar coins series in 2008.[272] The U.S. Mint has also
made commemorative silver medals for Van Buren, released for sale on February 1, 2021.[273][274]
Film and TV
Van Buren is portrayed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Hawthorne"] Nigel Hawthorne in the 1997 film [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amistad_(film)"] Amistad. The film depicts the legal battle
surrounding the status of slaves who in 1839 rebelled against their transporters on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Amistad"] La Amistad slave
ship.[275]
On the television show [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld"] Seinfeld, the episode "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Van_Buren_Boys"] The Van Buren Boys" is about a fictional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_gang"] street gang that
admires Van Buren and bases its rituals and symbols on him, including the hand sign of eight fingers
pointing up.[276]
In an episode of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees_(TV_series)"] The Monkees, "Dance, Monkee, Dance", a dance instruction studio offers free lessons to
anyone who can answer the question, "Who was the eighth President of the United States?" Martin Van
Buren, portrayed by Stephen Coit, appears at the studio to claim the prize.[277]
Music
At least two bands have incorporated Van Buren as part of their name: the Illinois-based The Van Buren
Boys and The Van Burens from Quincy, Massachusetts.[278][279]

Notes
a. The "mistletoe" nickname was inspired by the fact that mistletoe is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitic_plant"] parasitic plant which
attaches itself to a host tree to survive. Comparing Van Buren to mistletoe implied that he
advanced politically only through his connection to the "Old Hickory" tree, which
represented Andrew Jackson. This idea was common in Whig propaganda pieces, and also
seen in political comics such as The Rejected Minister, where Van Buren is shown being
carried into office by Jackson.
