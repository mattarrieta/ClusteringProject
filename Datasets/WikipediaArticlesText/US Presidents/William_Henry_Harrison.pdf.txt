William Henry Harrison
William Henry Harrison (February 9, 1773 – April 4,
1841) was an American military officer and politician who
served as the 9th [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"] president of the United States. Harrison
died just 31 days after his inauguration in 1841, and had the
shortest presidency in U.S. history. He was also the first
 U.S president to die in office, and a brief constitutional
crisis resulted as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_line_of_succession"] presidential succession was not then fully
defined in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution"] United States Constitution. Harrison was the
 last president born as a British subject in the Thirteen
 Colonies and was the paternal grandfather of Benjamin
Harrison, the 23rd president of the United States. 
William Henry Harrison
Harrison was born in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_City_County,_Virginia"] Charles City County, Virginia, a son
 of Benjamin Harrison V, who was a Founding Father of the
United States. During his early military career, Harrison
participated in the 1794 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fallen_Timbers"] Battle of Fallen Timbers, an
 American military victory that ended the Northwest Indian
 War. Later, he led a military force against Tecumseh's
confederacy at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Tippecanoe"] Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, where he
earned the nickname "Old Tippecanoe." He was promoted
to major general in the Army during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812"] War of 1812, and
 led American infantry and cavalry to victory at the Battle of
the Thames in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Canada"] Upper Canada.
Harrison's  political career began in 1798, with an
appointment as Secretary of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territory"] Northwest Territory; in
1799 he was elected as the territory's non-voting delegate in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives"] U.S. House of Representatives. He became governor of
the newly established [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Territory"] Indiana Territory in 1801 and
negotiated multiple treaties with American Indian tribes,
with the nation acquiring millions of acres. After the War of
1812, he moved to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio"] Ohio where he was elected to represent
the state's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio%27s_1st_congressional_district"] 1st district in the U.S. House in 1816. In 1824, he
was elected to the U.S. Senate, though his Senate term was
cut short by his appointment as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plenipotentiary"] Minister Plenipotentiary to
 Gran Colombia in 1828.
Harrison returned to private life in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bend,_Ohio"] North Bend, Ohio until
he was nominated as one of several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)"] Whig Party nominees
for president in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1836_United_States_presidential_election"] 1836 presidential election; he was
defeated by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"] Democratic vice president [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren"] Martin Van Buren.
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyler"] Four years later, the party nominated him again, with John
Tyler as his running mate, under the campaign slogan

Just three weeks after his inauguration, Harrison fell ill and
died days later. After resolution of an ambiguity in the
constitution regarding succession to the powers and duties
of the office, Tyler became president. At 68, Harrison was
the oldest person to assume the U.S. presidency until
 Ronald Reagan was elected in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980_United_States_presidential_election"] 1980 at 69. Though he is
often omitted in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States"] historical presidential rankings due to his
brief tenure, he is remembered for his Indian entreaties, and
also his inventive election campaign tactics.

Early life and education
 Harrison was the seventh and youngest child of Benjamin
Harrison V and Elizabeth (Bassett) Harrison, born on
February 9, 1773, at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Plantation"] Berkeley Plantation, the home of the
 Harrison family of Virginia on the James River in Charles
City County.[2] This was a prominent political family of
English descent whose ancestors had been in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"] Virginia since
the 1630s;[3] he became the last American president not
born as an American citizen.[4] His father was a Virginia
 planter, who served as a delegate to the Continental
 Congress (1774–1777) and who signed the Declaration of
Independence.[3] His father also served in the Virginia
legislature and as the fifth governor of Virginia (1781–
 1784) in the years during and after the American
 Revolutionary War.[3] Harrison's  older brother Carter
Bassett Harrison represented Virginia in the House of
Representatives (1793–1799).[5] William Henry often
referred to himself as a "child of the revolution," as indeed
he was, having grown up in a home just thirty miles from
where Washington won the war against the British in the
 Battle of Yorktown.[6]

Harrison was tutored at home until age 14 when he
attended [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampden%E2%80%93Sydney_College"] Hampden–Sydney College, a Presbyterian college
in Virginia.[3][7] He studied there for three years, receiving
a classical education that included Latin, Greek, French,
logic, and debate.[8][9] His Episcopalian father removed
him from the college, possibly for religious reasons, and
 after brief stays at an academy in Southampton County,
Virginia, and with his elder brother [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison_VI"] Benjamin in Richmond,
he went to Philadelphia in 1790.[10]

medical schooling, which he had also discovered he didn't
prefer.[6] He therefore withdrew from medical school, though school archives record him as a "non-
graduate alumnus of Penn's medical school class of 1793."[11] With the influence of his father's friend,
Governor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Lee_III"] Henry Lee III, he embarked upon a military career.[12]
Early military career
On August 16, 1791, within 24 hours of meeting Lee, Harrison, age 18, was commissioned as an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensign_(rank)#United_States"] ensign in
the Army and assigned to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_American_Regiment"] First American Regiment.[13] He was initially assigned to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Washington_(Ohio)"] Fort Washington,
 Cincinnati in the Northwest Territory where the army was engaged in the ongoing Northwest Indian
Page 4
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Indian_War"] War.[14] Biographer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_W._Freehling"] William W. Freehling says that young Harrison, in his first military act, rounded up
about eighty thrill-seekers and troublemakers off Philadelphia's streets, talked them into signing enlistment
papers, and marched them to Fort Washington.[6]
Harrison was promoted to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_lieutenant_(United_States)"] lieutenant after Major General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Wayne"] "Mad Anthony" Wayne took command of the
western army in 1792, following a disastrous defeat under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_St._Clair"] Arthur St. Clair.[13] In 1793, he became
Wayne's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aide-de-camp"] aide-de-camp and acquired the skills to command an army on the frontier;[7] he participated in
Wayne's decisive victory at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fallen_Timbers"] Battle of Fallen Timbers on August 20, 1794, which ended the Northwest
Indian War.[15] He received the following commendation from Wayne for his role in the battle: "I must add
the name of my faithful and gallant Aide-de-camp…Lieutenant Harrison, who…rendered the most essential
service by communicating my orders in every direction…conduct and bravery exciting the troops to press
for victory."[6] Harrison was a signatory of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Greenville"] Treaty of Greenville (1795), as witness to Wayne, the
principal negotiator for the U.S.[13] Under the terms of the treaty, a coalition of Indians ceded a portion of
their lands to the federal government, opening two-thirds of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio"] Ohio to settlement.[16][17]
At his mother's death in 1793, Harrison inherited a portion of his family's Virginia estate, including
approximately 3,000 acres (12 km2) of land and several slaves. He was serving in the Army at the time and
sold the land to his brother.[18] Harrison was promoted to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-3)"] captain in May 1797 and resigned from the Army
on June 1, 1798.[19]
Marriage and family
Harrison met [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Harrison"] Anna Tuthill Symmes of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bend,_Ohio"] North Bend, Ohio in 1795 when he was 22. She was a daughter of
Anna Tuthill and Judge [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cleves_Symmes"] John Cleves Symmes, who served as a colonel in the Revolutionary War and as a
representative to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_the_Confederation"] Congress of the Confederation.[20] Harrison asked the judge for permission to marry
Anna but was refused, so the couple waited until Symmes left on business. They then eloped and were
married on November 25, 1795, at the North Bend home of Stephen Wood, treasurer of the Northwest
Territory.[21] They honeymooned at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Washington_(Cincinnati,_Ohio)"] Fort Washington, since Harrison was still on military duty.[22] Judge
Symmes confronted him two weeks later at a farewell dinner for General Wayne, sternly demanding to
know how he intended to support a family. Harrison responded, "by my sword, and my own right arm,
sir."[23] The match was advantageous for Harrison, as he eventually exploited his father-in-law's
connections with land speculators, which facilitated his departure from the army.[6] Judge Symmes' doubts
about him persisted, as he wrote to a friend, "He can neither bleed, plead, nor preach, and if he could plow
I should be satisfied."[6] Matters eventually became cordial with the father-in-law, who later sold the
Harrisons 160 acres (65 ha) of land in North Bend, which enabled Harrison to build a home and start a
farm.[22]
The Harrisons had ten children: Elizabeth Bassett (1796–1846), John Cleves Symmes (1798–1830), Lucy
Singleton (1800–1826), William Henry Jr. (1802–1838), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Scott_Harrison"] John Scott (1804–1878) father of future U.S.
president [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Harrison"] Benjamin Harrison,[24] Benjamin (1806–1840),  Mary Symmes (1809–1842),  Carter Bassett
(1811–1839), Anna Tuthill (1813–1865), and James Findlay (1814–1817).[25] Anna was frequently in poor
health during the marriage, primarily because of her many pregnancies, yet she outlived William by 23
 years, dying on February 25, 1864, at 88.[8][26] Professor Kenneth R. Janken, in his biography of Walter
Francis White, claims that Harrison had six children by an enslaved African-American woman named
Dilsia. The assertion is based upon the White family's oral history but is not otherwise documented.[27]
Political career
Page 5
Harrison began his political career when he temporarily resigned from the military on June 1, 1798, and
campaigned among his friends and family for a post in the Northwest Territorial government.[13] His close
friend [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Pickering"] Timothy Pickering was serving as Secretary of State, and along with Judge Symmes’ influence, he
was recommended to replace [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winthrop_Sargent"] Winthrop Sargent, the outgoing territorial secretary.[6] President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams"] John Adams
appointed Harrison to the position in July 1798.[13] The work of recording the activities of the territory was
tedious, and he soon became bored, and sought a position in the U. S. Congress.[28]
U.S. Congress 
Harrison had many friends in the eastern aristocracy and quickly
gained a reputation among them as a frontier leader. He ran a
successful horse-breeding enterprise that won him acclaim
throughout the Northwest Territory.[13] Congress had legislated a
territorial policy that led to high land costs, a primary concern for
settlers in the Territory; Harrison became their champion to lower
those prices. The Northwest Territory's population reached a
sufficient number to have a congressional delegate in October
1799, and Harrison ran for election.[31] He campaigned to
encourage further migration to the territory, which eventually led to
statehood.[32]

House of Representatives from the
 Northwest Territory, c. 1800 by
 Charles Balthazar Julien Févret de
Saint-Mémin.[29][30] 
and served in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_United_States_Congress"] Sixth United States Congress from March 4,
1799, to May 14, 1800.[1][33] He had no authority to vote on
legislative bills, but he was permitted to serve on a committee, to
submit legislation, and to engage in debate.[34] He became
chairman of the Committee on Public Lands and promoted the
Land Act of 1800, which made it easier to buy Northwest Territory
land in smaller tracts at a lower cost.[31] Freeholders were permitted to buy smaller lots with a down
payment of only five percent, and this became an important factor in the Territory's rapid population
growth.[35]
Harrison was also instrumental in arranging the division of the Territory into two sections.[31] The eastern
section continued to be known as the Northwest Territory and consisted of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio"] Ohio and eastern Michigan; the
western section was named the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Territory"] Indiana Territory and consisted of Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, a portion of
western Michigan, and the eastern portion of Minnesota. The two new territories were formally established
by law in 1800.[36]
On May 13, 1800, President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams"] John Adams appointed Harrison as the governor of the Indiana Territory,
based on his ties to the west and his apparent neutral political stances.[37] He served in this capacity for
twelve years.[38] His governorship was confirmed by the Senate and he resigned from Congress to become
the first Indiana territorial governor in 1801.[31][39]
Indiana territorial governor
Harrison began his duties on January 10, 1801, at Vincennes, the capital of the Indiana Territory.[40]
Presidents [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"] Thomas Jefferson and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison were both members of the Democratic-Republican Party,
and they reappointed him as governor in 1803, 1806, and 1809.[31] Harrison was in 1804 also assigned to
Page 6
administer the civilian government of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Louisiana"] District of Louisiana. He conducted the district's affairs for five
 weeks until the Louisiana Territory was formally established on July 4, 1805, and Brigadier General James
Wilkinson assumed the duties of governor.[41]
In 1805, Harrison built a plantation-style home near Vincennes that he named Grouseland, in tribute to the
birds on the property.[20] The 26-room home was one of the first brick structures in the territory;[42] and it
served as a center of social and political life in the territory during his tenure as governor.[43] Harrison
founded a university at Vincennes in 1801, which was incorporated as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincennes_University"] Vincennes University on November
29, 1806.[44] The territorial capital was eventually moved to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corydon,_Indiana"] Corydon in 1813, and Harrison built a second
home at nearby [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Spring"] Harrison Valley.[45]
Harrison's primary responsibility was to obtain title to Indian lands that would allow future settlement and
increase the territory's population, a requirement for statehood. He was also eager to expand the territory for
personal reasons, as his political fortunes were tied to Indiana's eventual statehood.[6] While benefiting from
land speculation on his own behalf, and acquiring two milling operations, he was credited as a good
administrator, with significant improvements in roads and other infrastructure.[6]
When Harrison was reappointed as the Indiana territorial governor on February 8, 1803, he was given
expanded authority to negotiate and conclude treaties with the Indians.[31] The 1804 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_St._Louis_(1804)"] Treaty of St. Louis
with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quashquame"] Quashquame required the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauk_people"] Sauk and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meskwaki"] Meskwaki tribes to cede much of western Illinois and parts of
Missouri. Many of the Sauk resented the loss of lands, especially their leader [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk_(Sauk_leader)"] Black Hawk.[46] Harrison
thought that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Grouseland"] Treaty of Grouseland (1805) appeased some of the Indians, but tensions remained high
along the frontier.[47] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Fort_Wayne_(1809)"] Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809) raised new tensions when Harrison purchased more
than 2.5 million acres (10,000 km2) from the Potawatomi, Delaware, Miami, and Eel River tribes. Some
Indians disputed the authority of the tribes joining in the treaty.[48] Harrison was also able to conduct
matters unquestioned by the government, as the administration changed hands from Jefferson to
Madison.[6]
He pursued the treaty process aggressively, offering large subsidies to the tribes and their leaders, so as to
gain political favor with Jefferson before his departure.[49] Biographer Freehling asserts that the Indians
perceived the ownership of land was as common to all, just as the air that is breathed. In 1805, Harrison
succeeded in acquiring for the nation as many as 51,000,000 acres from the Indians, after plying five of
their chiefs with alcohol, for no more than a penny per 200 acres, and comprising two-thirds of Illinois and
sizable chunks of Wisconsin and Missouri.[6]
In addition to resulting tensions with the Indians, Harrison's pro-slavery position made him unpopular with
the Indiana Territory's abolitionists, as he tried in vain to encourage slavery in the territory. In 1803, he had
lobbied Congress to temporarily suspend for ten years Article VI of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Ordinance"] Northwest Ordinance prohibiting
slavery in the Indiana Territory.[50] Though Harrison asserted that the suspension was necessary to promote
settlement and make the territory economically viable and ready for statehood, the proposal failed.[51]
Lacking the suspension of Article VI, in 1807 the territorial legislature, with Harrison's support, enacted
laws that authorized indentured servitude and gave masters authority to determine the length of service.[52]
President Jefferson, primary author of the Northwest Ordinance, made a secret compact with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lemen"] James Lemen
to defeat the nascent pro-slavery movement supported by Harrison.[53] He donated $100 to encourage
Lemen with abolition and other good works, and later another $20 to help fund the church known as
Bethel Baptist Church.[53] In Indiana, the planting of the anti-slavery church led to citizens signing a
petition and organizing politically to defeat Harrison's efforts to legalize slavery in the territory.[53]
The Indiana Territory held elections to the legislature's upper and lower houses for the first time in 1809.
Harrison found himself at odds with the legislature after the abolitionists came to power, and the eastern
portion of the Indiana Territory grew to include a large anti-slavery population.[41] The Territory's general
Page 7
assembly convened in 1810, and its anti-slavery faction immediately repealed the indenturing laws
previously enacted.[54] After 1809, the Indiana legislature assumed more authority and the territory
advanced toward statehood.
Army general
Tecumseh and Tippecanoe
Indian resistance to American expansion came to a head, with the leadership of Shawnee brothers
 Tecumseh and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenskwatawa"] Tenskwatawa ("The Prophet"), in a conflict that became known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tecumseh%27s_War"] Tecumseh's War.[55]
Tenskwatawa convinced the tribes that they would be protected by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Spirit"] Great Spirit and no harm could
befall them if they rose up against the settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white
traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing,
muskets, and especially whiskey.[55] Harrison received word of the resistance through spies he had placed
within the tribes, and asked Madison to fund military preparations. Madison drug his feet, and Harrison
attempted to negoitiate, sending a letter to Tecumseh saying, "Our Blue Coats (U.S. Army soldiers) are
more numerous than you can count, and our hunting shirts (volunteer militiamen) are like the leaves of the
forests or the grains of sand on the Wabash."[6]
In August 1810, Tecumseh led 400 warriors down the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabash_River"] Wabash River to
meet with Harrison in Vincennes. They were dressed in war paint, and their
sudden appearance at first frightened the soldiers at Vincennes.[56] The
leaders of the group were escorted to Grouseland, where they met
Harrison. Tecumseh berated the condescending Harrison repeatedly, and
insisted that the Fort Wayne Treaty was illegitimate, arguing that one tribe
could not sell land without the approval of the other tribes. He asked
Harrison to nullify it and warned that Americans should not attempt to
settle the lands sold in the treaty.[6] Tecumseh informed Harrison that he
had threatened to kill the chiefs who signed the treaty if they carried out its
terms and that his confederation of tribes was growing rapidly.[57] Harrison
said that the individual tribes were the owners of the land and could sell it
as they wished. He rejected Tecumseh's claim that all the Indians formed
one nation and said that each tribe could have separate relations with the
United States if they chose to do so. Harrison argued that the Great Spirit
would have made all the tribes speak one language if they were to be one
nation.[57] 
1915 depiction of
Tecumseh, believed to be
copying an 1808 sketch
Tecumseh launched an "impassioned rebuttal," in the words of one historian, but Harrison was unable to
understand his language.[57] Tecumseh then began shouting at Harrison and called him a liar.[6] A
Shawnee friendly to Harrison cocked his pistol from the sidelines to alert Harrison that Tecumseh's speech
was leading to trouble, and some witnesses reported that Tecumseh was encouraging the warriors to kill
Harrison. Many of them began to pull their weapons, representing a substantial threat to Harrison and the
town, which held a population of only 1,000. Harrison drew his sword, and Tecumseh's warriors backed
down when the officers presented their firearms in his defense.[57] Chief [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamac"] Winamac was friendly to
Harrison, and he countered Tecumseh's arguments, telling the warriors that they should return home in
peace since they had come in peace. Before leaving, Tecumseh informed Harrison that he would seek an
alliance with the British if the Fort Wayne Treaty was not nullified.[58] After the meeting, Tecumseh
journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tecumseh%27s_Confederacy"] confederation to battle the
United States.[59]

Harrison was concerned that Tecumseh's actions would endanger the statehood of Indiana, as well as his
political future, leaving it "the haunt of a few wretched savages."[6] Tecumseh was traveling in 1811,
leaving Tenskwatawa in charge of Indian forces. Harrison saw a window of opportunity in Tecumseh's
absence, and advised Secretary of War [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Eustis"] William Eustis to present a show of force to the Indian
confederation.[60] Despite being 13 years removed from military action, Harrison convinced Madison and
Eustis to allow him to assume command.[6] He led an army north with 950 men to intimidate the Shawnee
 into making peace, but the tribes launched a surprise attack early on November 7 in the Battle of
Tippecanoe.[61] Harrison countered and defeated the tribal forces at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophetstown_State_Park"] Prophetstown next to the Wabash and
 Tippecanoe Rivers; the battle became famous and he was hailed as a national hero. Although his troops had
suffered 62 dead and 126 wounded during the battle and the Shawnee just 150 casualties, the Shawnee
prophet's vision of spiritual protection had been shattered. Tenskwatawa and his forces fled to Canada, and
their campaign to unite the tribes of the region to reject assimilation failed.[62][63]
When reporting to Secretary Eustis, Harrison had informed him of the battle near the Tippecanoe River and
that he had anticipated an attack. A first dispatch had not been clear which side had won the conflict, and
the secretary interpreted it as a defeat until the follow-up dispatch clarified the situation.[64] When no
second attack came, the Shawnee defeat had become more certain. Eustis demanded to know why Harrison
had not taken adequate precautions in fortifying his camp against the initial attack, and Harrison said that he
had considered the position strong enough. The dispute was the catalyst of a disagreement between
Harrison and the Department of War, which continued into the War of 1812.[65] Freehling says that
Harrison's rusty skills resulted in his troops setting campfires the night before the battle, exposing their
position to a surprise attack and casualties.[6]
The press did not cover the battle at first, until one Ohio paper misinterpreted Harrison's first dispatch to
mean that he was defeated.[66] By December, however, most major American papers carried stories on the
battle victory, and public outrage grew over the Shawnee.[67] Americans blamed the British for inciting the
tribes to violence and supplying them with firearms, and Congress passed resolutions condemning the
British for interfering in American domestic affairs. Congress declared war on June 18, 1812, and Harrison
left Vincennes to seek a military appointment.[68]
War of 1812
The outbreak of war with the British in 1812 led to continued conflict with
Indians in the Northwest. Harrison briefly served as a major general in the
 Kentucky militia until the government commissioned him on September 17
to command the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Northwest_(United_States)"] Army of the Northwest.[68] He received federal military
pay for his service, and he also collected a territorial governor's salary from
September until December 28, when he formally resigned as governor and
continued his military service. Authors Gugin and St. Clair claim the
resignation was forced upon him.[68] Harrison was succeeded by John
Gibson as acting governor of the territory.[68]
 The Americans suffered a defeat in the siege of Detroit. General James
Winchester offered Harrison the rank of brigadier general, but Harrison
wanted sole command of the army. President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison removed
Winchester from command in September, and Harrison became commander
of the fresh recruits.[68] He received orders to retake Detroit and boost
morale, but he initially held back, unwilling to press the war northward.[6]
The British and their Indian allies greatly outnumbered Harrison's troops,
so Harrison constructed a defensive position during the winter along the
 Maumee River in northwest Ohio. He named it [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Meigs"] Fort Meigs in honor of

army north to battle. He won victories in the Indiana Territory as well as Ohio and recaptured Detroit
before invading Upper [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"] Canada (Ontario). His army defeated the British, and Tecumseh was killed, on
October 5, 1813, at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Thames"] Battle of the Thames. It was considered to be one of the great American victories in
the war, second only to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_New_Orleans"] Battle of New Orleans, and secured a national reputation for Harrison.[69][6]
In 1814, Secretary of War [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Armstrong_Jr."] John Armstrong divided the command of the army, assigning Harrison to an
outlying post and giving control of the front to one of Harrison's subordinates.[70] Armstrong and Harrison
had disagreed over the lack of coordination and effectiveness in the invasion of Canada, and Harrison
resigned from the army in May.[71][72] After the war ended, Congress investigated Harrison's resignation
and determined that Armstrong had mistreated him during his military campaign and that his resignation
was justified. Congress awarded Harrison a gold medal for his services during the war.[73]
Harrison and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Territory"] Michigan Territory's Governor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Cass"] Lewis Cass were responsible for negotiating the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Greenville_(1814)"] peace treaty
with the Indians.[74] President Madison appointed Harrison in June 1815 to help in negotiating a second
treaty with the Indians that became known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Springwells"] Treaty of Springwells, in which the tribes ceded a large
tract of land in the west, providing additional land for American purchase and settlement.[33]
Postwar life
Ohio politician and diplomat
Harrison resigned from the army in 1814, shortly before the
conclusion of the War of 1812, and returned to his family and farm in
 North Bend, Ohio.[6] Freehling claims that his expenses then well
exceeded his means and he fell into debt, that Harrison chose
"celebrity over duty," as he sought the adulation found at parties in
New York, Washington, and Philadelphia, and that he became an
office seeker.[6] He was elected in 1816 to complete [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McLean"] John McLean's
 term in the House of Representatives, representing Ohio's 1st
congressional district until 1819. He attempted to secure the post as
Secretary of War under President Monroe in 1817 but lost out to
 John C. Calhoun. He was also passed over for a diplomatic post to
Russia.[6] He was elected to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Senate"] Ohio State Senate in 1819 and
served until 1821, having lost the election for Ohio governor in
1820.[33] He ran in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1822_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Ohio"] 1822 election for the United States House of
Representatives, but lost to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_W._Gazlay"] James W. Gazlay.[6][75] He was elected
to the U.S. Senate in 1824, and was an Ohio presidential elector in
1820 for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe"] James Monroe[76] and for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay"] Henry Clay in 1824.[77] 
Poster lauding Harrison's
accomplishments
Harrison was appointed in 1828 as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_plenipotentiary"] minister plenipotentiary to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Colombia"] Gran Colombia, so he resigned from
Congress and served in his new post until March 8, 1829.[78] He arrived in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogot%C3%A1"] Bogotá on December 22, 1828,
and found the condition of Colombia saddening. He reported to the Secretary of State that the country was
on the edge of anarchy, and that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%B3n_Bol%C3%ADvar"] Simón Bolívar was about to become a military dictator.[78] He wrote a
letter of polite rebuke to Bolívar, stating that "the strongest of all governments is that which is most free"
and calling on Bolívar to encourage the development of democracy. In response, Bolívar wrote that the
United States "seem destined by Providence to plague America with torments in the name of freedom," a
sentiment that achieved fame in Latin America.[78]
Page 10
Freehling indicates Harrison's missteps in Columbia were "bad and frequent," that he failed to properly
maintain a position of neutrality in Columbian affairs, by publicly opposing Bolivar, and that Columbia
sought his removal. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson"] Andrew Jackson took office in March 1829, and recalled Harrison in order to make his
own appointment to the position.[6] Biographer James Hall claims that Harrison found in Columbia a
military despotism and that, "his liberal opinions, his stern republican integrity, and the plain simplicity of
his dress and manners, contrasted too strongly with the arbitrary opinions and ostentatious behaviour of the
public officers, to allow him to be long a favourite with those who had usurped the power of that
government. They feared that the people would perceive the difference between a real and a pretended
patriot, and commenced a series of persecutions against our minister, which rendered his situation extremely
irksome.”[79] A very similar sentiment of the situation is related by biographer Samuel Burr.
Harrison, after leaving his post but while still in the country, wrote his roughly ten-page letter to Bolivar,
which is reproduced in full in both the Hall and Burr biographies. It left the former struck by Harrison's
"deeply imbued principles of liberty." Burr describes the letter as "replete with wisdom, goodness, and
patriotism…and the purest of principles."[79][80]
Private citizen
Harrison returned to the United States and his North Bend farm, living in relative privacy after nearly four
decades of government service. He had accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime, and he lived
on his savings, a small pension, and the income produced by his farm. Burr references M. Chavalier, who
encountered Harrison in Cincinnati at this time, and described Harrison as "poor, with a numerous family,
abandoned by the Federal government, yet vigorous with independent thinking."[81]
Local supporters had come to Harrison's relief, by appointing him [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerk_of_Courts"] Clerk of Courts for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_County,_Ohio"] Hamilton County,
where he worked from 1836 until 1840.[82] Chevalier remarked, "His friends back east talk of making him
President, while here we make him clerk of an inferior court."[81] He also cultivated corn and established a
distillery to produce whiskey, but closed it after he became disturbed by the effects of alcohol on its
consumers. In an address to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_County,_Ohio"] Hamilton County Agricultural Board in 1831, he said that he had sinned in
making whiskey and hoped that others would learn from his mistake and stop the production of liquors.[83]
About this time, he met abolitionist and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_Railroad"] Underground Railroad conductor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_DeBaptiste"] George DeBaptiste who lived in
nearby Madison, and the two became friends. Harrison wrote at the time, "we might look forward to a day
when a North American sun would not look down upon a slave."[84] DeBaptiste became his valet, and
later White House steward.[85]
Burr closes his account of Harrison by describing an event, denied by some of his friends—a reception
given the general at Philadelphia, in 1836. According to Burr, "Thousands and tens of thousands crowded
Chesnut street wharf upon his arrival, and greeted him with continual cheering as he landed. He stepped
into the barouche but the crowd pressed forward so impetuously, that the horses became frightened and
reared frequently. A rush was made to unharness the animals when the General spoke to several of them
and endeavored to prevent it; but the team was soon unmanageable, and it became necessary to take them
off. A rope was brought, and attached to the carriage, by which the people drew it to the Marshall House.
This act was the spontaneous burst of ten thousand grateful hearts. Pennsylvanians fought under the hero,
and they loved him. We speak particularly on this point, because we were eyewitnesses of all that
passed."[86]
1836 presidential campaign
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Indiana"]
Page 11
Harrison was the western Whig candidate for president in 1836, one of four regional Whig party
candidates. The others were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Webster"] Daniel Webster, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Lawson_White"] Hugh L. White, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_P._Mangum"] Willie P. Mangum. More than one Whig
candidate emerged in an effort to defeat the incumbent Vice President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren"] Martin Van Buren, who was the
popular Jackson-chosen Democrat.[87] The Democrats charged that, by running several candidates, the
Whigs sought to prevent a Van Buren victory in the electoral college, and force the election into the
House.[88] In any case the plan, if there was one, failed. In the end, Harrison came in second, and carried
nine of the twenty-six states in the Union.[87][88][89]
Harrison ran in all the non-slave states except Massachusetts, and in the slave states of Delaware,
 Maryland, and Kentucky. White ran in the remaining slave states except for South Carolina. Daniel
Webster ran in Massachusetts, and Mangum in South Carolina.[90] Van Buren won the election with 170
electoral votes.[88] A swing of just over 4,000 votes in Pennsylvania would have given that state's 30
electoral votes to Harrison and the election would have been decided in the House of
Representatives.[91][88][89]
1840 presidential campaign
Harrison faced incumbent Van Buren as the sole Whig candidate in the
1840 election. The Whigs saw in Harrison a born southerner and war
hero, who would contrast well with the aloof, uncaring, and aristocratic
Van Buren.[87] He was chosen over more controversial members of the
party, such as Clay and Webster; his campaign highlighted his military
 record and focused on the weak U.S. economy caused by the Panic of
1837.[92]
The Whigs blamed Van Buren for the economic problems and
nicknamed him "Van Ruin."[92] The Democrats, in turn, ridiculed the
elder Harrison by calling him "Granny Harrison, the petticoat general,"  1840 Electoral Vote Map
because he resigned from the army before the War of 1812 ended. They
noted for the voters what Harrison's name would be when spelled
 backwards: "No Sirrah". They cast him as a provincial, out-of-touch old man who would rather "sit in his
log cabin drinking hard cider" than attend to the administration of the country. This strategy backfired when
Harrison and running mate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyler"] John Tyler adopted the log cabin and hard cider as campaign symbols. Their
campaign used the symbols on banners and posters and created bottles of hard cider shaped like log cabins,
all to connect the candidates to the "common man."[93] Freehling relates that, "One bitter pro-Van Buren
paper lamented after his defeat, 'We have been sung down, lied down and drunk down.' In one sentence,
this described the new American political process."[94]
Harrison came from a wealthy, slaveholding Virginia family, yet his campaign promoted him as a humble
frontiersman in the style popularized by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson"] Andrew Jackson, while presenting Van Buren as a wealthy
elitist.[93] A memorable example was the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Spoon_Oration"] Gold Spoon Oration that Pennsylvania's Whig representative
 Charles Ogle delivered in the House, ridiculing Van Buren's elegant White House lifestyle and lavish
spending.[95] The Whigs invented a chant in which people would spit tobacco juice as they chanted "wirt-
wirt," and this also exhibited the difference between candidates from the time of the election:[87]
Old Tip he wore a homespun coat, he had no ruffled shirt: wirt-wirt,
But Matt he has the golden plate, and he's a little squirt: wirt-wirt!
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ElectoralCollege1840.svg"]
Page 12
The Whigs boasted of Harrison's military record and his reputation as the hero of the Battle of Tippecanoe.
The campaign slogan "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tippecanoe_and_Tyler_too"] Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too" became one of the most famous in American
politics.[96] While Van Buren campaigned from the White House, Harrison was on the campaign trail,
entertaining with his impressions of Indian war whoops, and took people's minds off the nation's economic
troubles. In June 1840, a Harrison rally at the site of the Tippecanoe battle drew 60,000 people.[87] The
Village of North Bend, Ohio as well as the alumni of Ohio State University claim that the state's use of the
nickname "Buckeyes" began with Harrison's campaign message.[97][98] Voter turnout shot to a spectacular
80%, 20 points higher than the previous election.[94] Harrison won a landslide victory in the Electoral
College, 234 electoral votes to Van Buren's 60. The popular vote margin was much closer, at fewer than
150,000 votes, though he carried nineteen of the twenty-six states.[96][99]
Presidency (1841)
Inauguration
When Harrison came to Washington, he wanted to show that he was
still the steadfast hero of Tippecanoe and that he was a better educated
and more thoughtful man than the backwoods caricature portrayed in
the campaign. He [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_William_Henry_Harrison"] took the oath of office on Thursday, March 4, 1841, a
cold and wet day.[100] He braved the chilly weather and chose not to
wear an overcoat or a hat, rode on horseback to the grand ceremony,
and then delivered the longest inaugural address in American
history[100] at 8,445 words. It took him nearly two hours to read,
although his friend and fellow Whig [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Webster"] Daniel Webster had edited it for
length.[101] Freehling opines that speeches like this were actually
common at the time, and that its irony was rich, as Harrison, "a lifelong
office seeker, elected by deeply partisan politics, criticized both."[102] 
Painting by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Gallatin_Hoit"] Albert Gallatin Hoit,
The inaugural address was a detailed statement of the Whig agenda, a  1840
repudiation of Jackson's and Van Buren's policies, and the first and only
formal articulation by Harrison of his approach to the presidency.[102]
The address began with Harrison's sincere regard for the trust being placed in him:
However strong may be my present purpose to realize the expectations of a magnanimous and
confiding people, I too well understand the dangerous temptations to which I shall be exposed
from the magnitude of the power which it has been the pleasure of the people to commit to my
hands not to place my chief confidence upon the aid of that Almighty Power which has
hitherto protected me and enabled me to bring to favorable issues other important but still
greatly inferior trusts heretofore confided to me by my country.[103]
Harrison promised to re-establish the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States"] Bank of the United States and extend its capacity for credit by issuing
paper currency in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay"] Henry Clay's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_System_(economic_plan)"] American system.[100] He intended to rely on the judgment of Congress in
 legislative matters, using his veto power only if an act were unconstitutional, and to reverse Jackson's spoils
system of executive patronage.[102] He promised to use patronage to create a qualified staff, not to enhance
his own standing in government, and under no circumstance would he run for a second term. He
condemned the financial excesses of the prior administration and pledged not to interfere with
congressional financial policy. All in all, Harrison committed to a weak presidency, deferring to "the First
Branch," the Congress, in keeping with Whig principles.[102][101]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:William_Henry_Harrison.jpg"]
Page 13
He addressed the nation's already hotly debated issue of slavery. As a slaveholder himself, he agreed with
the right of states to control the matter:
"The lines, too, separating powers to be exercised by the citizens of one state from those of
another seem to be so distinctly drawn as to leave no room for misunderstanding…The attempt
of those of one state to control the domestic institutions of another can only result in feelings of
distrust and jealousy, the certain harbingers of disunion, violence, and civil war, and the
ultimate destruction of our free institutions."[103]
As he was about to conclude his remarks, Harrison incorporated his reliance upon the country's freedom of
religion while taking pains to present himself as part of the religious mainstream rather than a dissenter or
member of a minority faith:
I deem the present occasion sufficiently important and solemn to justify me in expressing to my
fellow-citizens a profound reverence for the Christian religion and a thorough conviction that
sound morals, religious liberty, and a just sense of religious responsibility are essentially
connected with all true and lasting happiness; and to that good Being who has blessed us by
the gifts of civil and religious freedom, who watched over and prospered the labors of our
fathers and has hitherto preserved to us institutions far exceeding in excellence those of any
other people, let us unite in fervently commending every interest of our beloved country in all
future time.[103]
Following the speech, he rode through the streets in the inaugural parade,[100] stood in a three-hour
receiving line at the White House, and attended three inaugural balls that evening,[104] including one at
Carusi's Saloon entitled the "Tippecanoe" ball with 1,000 guests who had paid $10 per person (equal to
$312 in 2021).[105]
The press of patronage
Clay was a leader of the Whigs and a powerful legislator, as well as a frustrated presidential candidate in his
own right, and he expected to have substantial influence in the Harrison administration. He ignored his own
platform plank of overturning the "spoils" system and attempted to influence Harrison's actions before and
during his brief presidency, especially in putting forth his own preferences for Cabinet offices and other
presidential appointments. Harrison rebuffed his aggression, saying, "Mr. Clay, you forget that I am the
President."[106] The dispute escalated when Harrison named as Secretary of State [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Webster"] Daniel Webster, Clay's
arch-rival for control of the Whig Party. Harrison also appeared to give Webster's supporters some highly
coveted patronage positions. His sole concession to Clay was to name his protégé [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_J._Crittenden"] John J. Crittenden to the
post of Attorney General. Despite this, the contretemps continued until the president's death.[107]
Clay was not the only one who hoped to benefit from Harrison's
election. Hordes of office applicants came to the White House,
which was then open to any who wanted a meeting with the
president. Most of Harrison's business during his month-long
presidency involved extensive social obligations and receiving
visitors at the White House. He was advised to have an
administration in place before the inauguration but declined,

wanting to focus on the festivities. As such, job seekers awaited
him at all hours and filled the Executive Mansion, with no process
for organizing and vetting them.[100]
Harrison wrote in a letter dated March 10, "I am so much harassed
by the multitude that calls upon me that I can give no proper
attention to any business of my own."[108] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service"] U.S. Marshal of the
 District of Columbia Alexander Hunter recalled an incident in
which Harrison was besieged by office seekers who were
preventing him from getting to a cabinet meeting; when his pleas
for their consideration were ignored, Harrison finally "accepted
their petitions, which filled his arms and pockets."[109] Another
anecdote of the time recounted that the halls were so full one
afternoon that in order to get from one room to the next, Harrison
had to be helped out a window, walked the length of the White
House exterior, and then helped in through another window.[109]

Harrison took seriously his pledge to reform executive appointments, visiting each of the six cabinet
departments to observe its operations and issuing through Webster an order that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electioneering"] electioneering by
employees would be considered grounds for dismissal.[100] He resisted pressure from other Whigs over
partisan patronage. A group arrived in his office on March 16 to demand the removal of all Democrats from
any appointed office, and Harrison proclaimed, "So help me God, I will resign my office before I can be
 guilty of such an iniquity!"[110] His own cabinet attempted to countermand his appointment of John
Chambers as Governor of the Iowa Territory in favor of Webster's friend [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wilson_II_(New_Hampshire_politician)"] James Wilson. Webster attempted
to press this decision at a March 25 cabinet meeting, and Harrison asked him to read aloud a handwritten
note, which said simply "William Henry Harrison, President of the United States." Harrison then stood and
declared: "William Henry Harrison, President of the United States, tells you, gentlemen, that, by God, John
Chambers shall be governor of Iowa!"[111]
Harrison's only other official decision of consequence was whether to call Congress into a special session.
He and Clay had disagreed over the necessity of such a session, and Harrison's cabinet proved evenly
divided, so the president initially vetoed the idea. Clay pressed him on the special session on March 13, but
Harrison rebuffed him and told him not to visit the White House again, to address him only in writing.[112]
A few days later, however, Treasury Secretary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Ewing"] Thomas Ewing reported to Harrison that federal funds were
in such trouble that the government could not continue to operate until Congress' regularly scheduled
session in December; Harrison thus relented, and proclaimed the special session on March 17, in the
interests of "the condition of the revenue and finance of the country." The session would have begun on
May 31 as scheduled if Harrison had lived.[113][114]
Death and funeral
On Wednesday, March 24, 1841, Harrison took his daily morning walk to local markets, without a coat or
hat. Despite being caught in a sudden rainstorm, he did not change his wet clothes upon return to the White
House.[115] On Friday, March 26, Harrison became ill with cold-like symptoms and sent for his doctor,
Thomas Miller, though he told the doctor he felt better after having taken medication for "fatigue and
mental anxiety."[115] The next day, Saturday, the doctor was called again, and arrived to find Harrison in
bed with a "severe chill," after taking another early morning walk. Miller applied mustard plaster to his
stomach and gave him a mild laxative, and he felt better that afternoon.[115] At 4:00 a.m. Sunday, March
28, Harrison developed severe pain in the side and the doctor initiated bloodletting; the procedure was
terminated when there was a drop in his pulse rate. Miller also applied heated cups to the president's skin to
enhance blood flow.[115] The doctor then gave him castor oil and medicines to induce vomiting, and
Page 15
diagnosed him with pneumonia in the right
lung.[115] A team of doctors was called in
Monday, March 29, and they confirmed right
lower lobe pneumonia.[116] Harrison was then
administered laudanum, opium, and camphor,
along with wine and brandy.[117]
No official announcements were made
concerning Harrison's illness, which fueled public
speculation and concern the longer he remained
out of public view.[116] Washington society had
noticed his uncharacteristic absence from church
on Sunday.[109] Conflicting and unconfirmed
newspaper reports were based on leaks by people
with contacts in the White House.[115] A 
An illustration depicting the death of Harrison, April 4,
1841
Washington paper reported on Thursday, April 1,
that Harrison's health was decidedly better. In
fact, Harrison's condition had seriously weakened, and Cabinet members and family were summoned to the
White House—his wife Anna had remained in Ohio due to her own illness.[115] According to papers in
Washington on Friday, Harrison had rallied, despite a Baltimore Sun report that his condition was of a
"more dangerous character."[115] A reporter for the New York Commercial indicated that, "...the country's
people were deeply distressed and many of them in tears.”[115]
In the evening of Saturday, April 3, Harrison developed severe diarrhea and became delirious, and at
 8:30 p.m. he uttered his last words, to his attending doctor, assumed to be for Vice President John
Tyler:[115] "Sir, I wish you to understand the true principles of the government. I wish them carried out. I
ask nothing more."[118] Harrison died at 12:30 a.m. on April 4, 1841, Palm Sunday, nine days after
becoming ill and exactly one month after taking the oath of office;[115] he was the first president to die in
office.[116] Anna was still in Ohio packing for the trip to Washington when she learned of her loss.[119]
The prevailing theory at the time was that his illness had been caused by the bad weather at his
inauguration three weeks earlier. [120] Jane McHugh and Philip A. Mackowiak did an analysis in Clinical
Infectious Diseases (2014), examining Miller's notes and records showing that the White House water
supply was downstream of public sewage, and they concluded that he likely died of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septic_shock"] septic shock due to
"enteric fever" ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_fever"] typhoid or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratyphoid_fever"] paratyphoid fever).[121][122]
A 30-day period of mourning commenced following the president's death. The White House hosted various
public ceremonies, modeled after European royal funeral practices. An invitation-only funeral service was
also held on April 7 in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Room"] East Room of the White House, after which Harrison's coffin was brought to
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Northup"] Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C. where it was placed in the Public Vault.[123] Solomon
Northup gave an account of the procession in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Years_a_Slave"] Twelve Years a Slave:
The next day there was a great pageant in Washington. The roar of cannon and the tolling of
bells filled the air, while many houses were shrouded with crape, and the streets were black
with people. As the day advanced, the procession made its appearance, coming slowly through
the Avenue, carriage after carriage, in long succession, while thousands upon thousands
followed on foot—all moving to the sound of melancholy music. They were bearing the dead
body of Harrison to the grave…. I remember distinctly how the window glass would break
and rattle to the ground, after each report of the cannon they were firing in the burial
ground.[124]
Page 16
That June, Harrison's body was transported by train and river barge to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bend,_Ohio"] North Bend, Ohio, and he was
 buried on July 7 at the summit of Mt. Nebo, which is now the William Henry Harrison Tomb State
Memorial.[125]
Impact of death
 Harrison's death called attention to an ambiguity in Article II,
 Section 1, Clause 6 of the Constitution regarding succession to the
presidency. The Constitution clearly provided for the vice president
to take over the "Powers and Duties of the said Office" in the event
of a president's removal, death, resignation, or inability, but it was
unclear whether the vice president formally became president of the
United States, or simply temporarily assumed the powers and duties
of that office, in a case of succession.[126] 
The William Henry Harrison Memorial
Harrison's cabinet insisted that Tyler was "Vice President acting as  in North Bend, Ohio
President." Tyler was resolute in his claim to the title of President
and in his determination to exercise the full powers of the
presidency.[127] The cabinet consulted with Chief Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Taney"] Roger Taney and decided that, if Tyler took the
presidential oath of office, he would assume the office of president. Tyler obliged and was sworn into office
on April 6, 1841. Congress convened in May and, after a short period of debate in both houses, passed a
resolution, which confirmed Tyler as president for the remainder of Harrison's term.[128] The precedent that
he set in 1841 was followed on seven occasions when an incumbent president died, and it was written into
the Constitution in 1967 through Section One of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] Twenty-fifth Amendment.[129]
Legacy
Historical reputation
Among Harrison's most enduring legacies is the series of treaties that he
negotiated and signed with Indian leaders during his tenure as the Indiana
territorial governor.[8] As part of the treaty negotiations, the tribes ceded
large tracts of land in the west which provided additional acreage for
purchase and settlement by the nation.[33][130]
Harrison's long-term impact on American politics includes his campaigning
methods, which laid the foundation for modern presidential campaign
tactics.[131] Harrison died nearly penniless, and Congress voted his wife
Anna a presidential widow's pension of $25,000,[132] one year of
Harrison's salary (equivalent to about $657,000 in 2021).[133] She also
received the right to mail letters free of charge.[134]

 Tippecanoe County
Courthouse, Lafayette,
Indiana
Freehling refers to Harrison as "the most dominant figure in the evolution of the Northwest territories into
the Upper Midwest today."[135] Harrison, age 68 at the time of his inauguration, was the oldest person to
assume the U.S. presidency, a distinction he held until 1981, when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan"] Ronald Reagan was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_inauguration_of_Ronald_Reagan"] inaugurated at age
69.[136]
Page 17
Harrison's son [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Scott_Harrison"] John Scott Harrison represented Ohio in the House of Representatives between 1853 and
1857.[137] Harrison's grandson Benjamin Harrison of Indiana served as the 23rd president from 1889 to
1893, making William and Benjamin Harrison the only grandparent-grandchild pair of presidents.[138]
Honors and tributes
Several monuments and memorial statues have been erected in tribute to Harrison. There are public statues
 of him in downtown Indianapolis,[139] Cincinnati's  Piatt Park,[140] the Tippecanoe County
Courthouse,[141] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_County,_Indiana"] Harrison County, Indiana,[142] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_County,_Indiana"] Owen County, Indiana.[143] Numerous counties and
towns also bear his name.
The Village of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bend,_Ohio"] North Bend, Ohio, honors Harrison every year with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade"] parade to celebrate his birthday.[144]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gen._William_Henry_Harrison_Headquarters"] Gen. William Henry Harrison Headquarters in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklinton_(Columbus,_Ohio)"] Franklinton, Ohio commemorates Harrison. The house
was his military headquarters from 1813 to 1814.[145] On February 19, 2009, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Mint"] U.S. Mint released the
ninth coin in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_$1_Coin_Program"] Presidential $1 Coin Program, bearing Harrison's likeness.[146][147]
