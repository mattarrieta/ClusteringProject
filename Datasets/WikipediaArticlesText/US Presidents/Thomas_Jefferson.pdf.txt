Thomas Jefferson
Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743[a] – July 4, 1826) was an
American statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher,
 and Founding Father who served as the 3rd president of the
United States from 1801 to 1809. He was previously the
second [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president_of_the_United_States"] vice president of the United States under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams"] John Adams
 and the first United States secretary of state under George
 Washington. The principal author of the Declaration of
Independence, Jefferson was a proponent of democracy,
 republicanism, and individual rights, motivating American
colonists to break from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain"] Kingdom of Great Britain and form
a new nation; he produced formative documents and decisions
at both the state and national levels. 
Thomas Jefferson
During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution"] American Revolution, Jefferson represented
 Virginia in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Congress"] Continental Congress that adopted the
Declaration of Independence. As a Virginia legislator, he
drafted a state law for religious freedom. He served as the
second [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia"] Governor of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, during the
 Revolutionary War. In 1785, Jefferson was appointed the
United States Minister to France, and subsequently, the nation's
first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State"] secretary of state under President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"] George Washington
from 1790 to 1793. Jefferson and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison organized
 the Democratic-Republican Party to oppose the Federalist
Party during the formation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Party_System"] First Party System. With
 Madison, he anonymously wrote the provocative Kentucky
and Virginia Resolutions in 1798 and 1799, which sought to
 strengthen states' rights by nullifying the federal Alien and
Sedition Acts.
Jefferson and Federalist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams"] John Adams became friends as well as
political rivals, serving in the Continental Congress and
 drafting the Declaration of Independence together. In the 1796
presidential election between the two, Jefferson came in
second, which according to electoral procedure at the time,
made him vice president to Adams. Jefferson challenged
Adams again in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1800_United_States_presidential_election"] 1800 and won the presidency. After his term
in office, Jefferson eventually reconciled with Adams and they
shared a correspondence that lasted fourteen years.
As president, Jefferson pursued the nation's shipping and trade
interests against [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_pirates"] Barbary pirates and aggressive British trade
policies. Starting in 1803, he promoted a western expansionist
policy with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase"] Louisiana Purchase which doubled the nation's
claimed land area. To make room for settlement, Jefferson
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Territory"] began the process of Indian tribal removal from the newly
acquired territory. As a result of peace negotiations with

 France, his administration reduced military forces. He was re-
elected in 1804, but his second term was beset with difficulties
 at home, including the trial of former vice president Aaron
Burr. In 1807, American foreign trade was diminished when
Jefferson implemented the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embargo_Act_of_1807"] Embargo Act in response to British
threats to U.S. shipping. The same year, Jefferson signed the
 Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves.
Jefferson, while primarily a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantations_in_the_American_South#Plantation_owner"] plantation owner, lawyer, and
politician, mastered many disciplines, ranging from surveying
and mathematics to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horticulture"] horticulture and mechanics. He was also an
architect in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_architecture"] classical tradition. Jefferson's keen interest in
 religion and philosophy led to his presidency of the American
Philosophical Society; he shunned organized religion but was
influenced by Christianity, Epicureanism,[1] and deism.
Jefferson rejected [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_fundamentalism"] fundamental Christianity, denying Christ's
divinity. A philologist, Jefferson knew several languages. He
was a prolific letter writer and corresponded with many
 prominent people, including Edward Carrington, John Taylor
 of Caroline and James Madison. Among his books is Notes on
the State of Virginia (1785),  considered perhaps the most
important American book published before 1800.[10] Jefferson
championed the ideals, values, and teachings of the
Enlightenment.
 Over the course of his life, Jefferson owned more than 600
slaves. Since Jefferson's time, controversy has revolved around
his relationship with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Hemings"] Sally Hemings, a mixed-race enslaved
woman and his late [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Jefferson"] wife's half-sister.[11] According to 1998
DNA testing of Jefferson's  and Hemings' descendants,
combined with documentary and statistical evidence and oral
history, Jefferson fathered at least six children with Hemings,
including four that survived to adulthood.[12] Evidence
suggests that Jefferson started the relationship with Hemings
when they were in Paris, some time after she arrived there at
the age of 14 or 15, when Jefferson was 44. By the time she
returned to the United States at 16 or 17, she was pregnant.[13]
After retiring from public office, Jefferson founded the
 University of Virginia. He and John Adams both died on July
4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)"] U.S. independence.
Presidential scholars and historians generally praise Jefferson's
public achievements, including his advocacy of religious
freedom and tolerance in Virginia. Historians also admire
 President Jefferson's peaceful acquisition of the Louisiana
Territory from France without war or controversy, in addition
to the success of his ambitious [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition"] Lewis and Clark Expedition.
Though modern historians are critical of his involvement with
slavery, Jefferson is overwhelmingly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States"] ranked as one of the
greatest presidents in American history.

Thomas Jefferson was born on April 13, 1743 (April 2, 1743, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates"] Old Style, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar"] Julian calendar), at the family's
 Shadwell Plantation in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Virginia"] Colony of Virginia, the third of ten children.[14] He was of English, and possibly
Welsh, descent and was born a British subject.[15] His father [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jefferson"] Peter Jefferson was a planter and surveyor
who died when Jefferson was fourteen; his mother was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Randolph_Jefferson"] Jane Randolph.[b] Peter Jefferson moved his family
to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckahoe_(plantation)"] Tuckahoe Plantation in 1745 upon the death of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_III_(son_of_Thomas)"] William Randolph III, the plantation's owner and
Jefferson's friend, who in his will had named Peter guardian of Randolph's children. The Jeffersons
returned to Shadwell in 1752, where Peter died in 1757; his estate was divided between his sons Thomas
and Randolph.[17] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvie_Sr."] John Harvie Sr. then became Thomas' guardian.[18] In 1753 he attended the wedding of
his uncle Field Jefferson to Mary Allen Hunt, who became a close friend and early mentor.[19] Thomas
inherited approximately 5,000 acres (2,000 ha; 7.8 sq mi) of land, including Monticello, and assumed full
authority over his property at age 21.[20]
Education, early family life
Jefferson began his education together with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph_family_of_Virginia"] Randolph children by tutors at Tuckahoe.[21] Thomas'
father Peter was self-taught, regretted not having a formal education, and entered Thomas into an English
school at age five. In 1752, at age nine, he attended a local school run by a Scottish Presbyterian minister
and also began studying the natural world, which he grew to love. At this time he began studying Latin,
Greek, and French, while also learning to ride horses. Thomas also read books from his father's modest
library.[22] He was taught from 1758 to 1760 by the Reverend [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Maury"] James Maury near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordonsville,_Virginia"] Gordonsville, Virginia,
where he studied history, science, and the classics while boarding with Maury's family.[23][22] Jefferson
then came to know and befriended various American Indians, including the famous Cherokee chief
Page 5
 Ontasseté,  who often stopped at Shadwell to visit on their way to
Williamsburg to trade.[24][25] During the two years Jefferson was with the
 Maury family, he traveled to Williamsburg and was a guest of Colonel
Dandridge, father of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Washington"] Martha Washington. In Williamsburg the young
Jefferson met and came to admire [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Henry"] Patrick Henry, eight years his senior, and
shared a common interest in violin playing.[26]
 Jefferson entered the College of
 William & Mary in Williamsburg,
Virginia at age 16 and studied
mathematics, metaphysics, and
 philosophy with Professor William 
Thomas Jefferson's Coat of
Arms
Small. Under Small's  tutelage,
Jefferson encountered the ideas of the British Empiricists, including
 John Locke, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon"] Francis Bacon, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton"] Isaac Newton. Small introduced
Wren Building, College of William &
Mary where Jefferson studied 
Jefferson to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wythe"] George Wythe and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fauquier"] Francis Fauquier. Small, Wythe,
and Fauquier recognized Jefferson as a man of exceptional ability
and included him in their inner circle, where he became a regular
member of their Friday dinner parties where politics and
philosophy were discussed. Jefferson later wrote that he "heard more common good sense, more rational &
philosophical conversations than in all the rest of my life".[27] During his first year at the college he was
given more to parties and dancing and was not very frugal with his expenditures; in his second year,
regretting that he had squandered away much time and money, he dedicated himself to fifteen hours of
study a day.[28] Jefferson improved his French and Greek and his skill at the violin. He graduated two years
after starting in 1762. He [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_law"] read the law under Wythe's tutelage to obtain his law license while working as a
 law clerk in his office.[29] He also read a wide variety of English classics and political works.[30] Jefferson
was well-read in a broad variety of subjects, which along with law and philosophy, included history, natural
law, natural religion, ethics, and several areas in science, including agriculture. Overall, he drew very
deeply on the philosophers. During the years of study under the watchful eye of Wythe, Jefferson authored
a survey of his extensive readings in his Commonplace Book.[31] Wythe was so impressed with Jefferson
that he later bequeathed his entire library to him.[32]
The year 1765 was an eventful one in Jefferson's family. In July, his sister Martha married his close friend
and college companion [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dabney_Carr"] Dabney Carr, which greatly pleased Jefferson. In October, he mourned his sister
Jane's unexpected death at age 25 and wrote a farewell epitaph in Latin.[33] Jefferson treasured his books
and amassed three libraries in his lifetime. The first, a library of 200 volumes started in his youth which
included books inherited from his father and left to him by George Wythe,[34] was destroyed when his
Shadwell home burned in a 1770 fire. Nevertheless, he had replenished his collection with 1,250 titles by
1773, and it grew to almost 6,500 volumes by 1814.[35] He organized his wide variety of books into three
broad categories corresponding with elements of the human mind: memory, reason, and imagination.[36]
After the British burned the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress"] Library of Congress during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_Washington"] Burning of Washington, he sold this second
library to the U.S. government to jumpstart the Library of Congress collection, for the price of $23,950.
Jefferson used a portion of the money secured by the sale to pay off some of his large debt, remitting
$10,500 to William Short and $4,870 to John Barnes of Georgetown. However, he soon resumed collecting
for his personal library, writing to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams"] John Adams, "I cannot live without books."[37][38] He began to construct
a new library of his personal favorites and by the time of his death a decade later it had grown to almost
2,000 volumes.[39]
Lawyer and House of Burgesses
Page 6
Jefferson was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1767, and lived with
 his mother at Shadwell.[40] Jefferson also represented Albemarle
County as a delegate in the Virginia [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Burgesses"] House of Burgesses from 1769
until 1775.[41] He pursued reforms to slavery, offering legislation in
1769 to allow masters to control emancipation of slaves, taking
discretion away from the royal governor and General Court. He
persuaded his cousin [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Bland"] Richard Bland to spearhead the legislation's
passage, but the reaction was strongly negative.[42]
Jefferson took seven cases for freedom-seeking slaves[43] and
waived his fee for one client, who claimed that he should be freed
before the statutory age of thirty-one required for emancipation in
 cases with inter-racial grandparents.[44] He invoked the Natural 
House of Burgesses in Williamsburg,
Virginia, where Jefferson served
1769–1775
Law to argue, "everyone comes into the world with a right to his
own person and using it at his own will ... This is what is called personal liberty, and is given him by the
author of nature, because it is necessary for his own sustenance." The judge cut him off and ruled against
his client. As a consolation, Jefferson gave his client some money, conceivably used to aid his escape
shortly thereafter.[44] He later incorporated this sentiment into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence"] Declaration of Independence.[45] He also
took on 68 cases for the General Court of Virginia in 1767, in addition to three notable cases: Howell v.
Netherland (1770), Bolling v. Bolling (1771), and Blair v. Blair (1772).[46]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain"] British parliament passed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intolerable_Acts"] Intolerable Acts in 1774, and Jefferson wrote a resolution calling for a
"Day of Fasting and Prayer" in protest, as well as a boycott of all British goods. His resolution was later
expanded into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Summary_View_of_the_Rights_of_British_America"] A Summary View of the Rights of British America, in which he argued that people have the
right to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-governing_colony"] govern themselves.[47]
Monticello, marriage, and family
In 1768, Jefferson began constructing his primary residence
Monticello (Italian for "Little Mountain") on a hilltop overlooking
his 5,000-acre (20 km2; 7.8 sq mi) plantation.[c] He spent most of
his adult life designing Monticello as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect"] architect and was quoted as
saying, "Architecture is my delight, and putting up, and pulling
down, one of my favorite amusements."[49] Construction was done
Jefferson's home [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monticello"] Monticello in 
mostly by local masons and carpenters, assisted by Jefferson's
slaves.[50]
Virginia 
He moved into the South Pavilion in 1770. Turning Monticello into
a neoclassical masterpiece in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladian_architecture"] Palladian style was his perennial
project.[51] On January 1, 1772, Jefferson married his third cousin[52] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Jefferson"] Martha Wayles Skelton, the 23-year-
old widow of Bathurst Skelton, and she moved into the South Pavilion.[53][54] She was a frequent hostess
for Jefferson and managed the large household. Biographer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumas_Malone"] Dumas Malone described the marriage as the
happiest period of Jefferson's life.[55] Martha read widely, did fine needlework, and was a skilled pianist;
Jefferson often accompanied her on the violin or cello.[56] During their ten years of marriage, Martha bore
six children: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Jefferson_Randolph"] Martha "Patsy" (1772–1836); Jane (1774–1775); a son who lived for only a few weeks in
1777; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jefferson_Eppes"] Mary "Polly" (1778–1804); Lucy Elizabeth (1780–1781); and another Lucy Elizabeth (1782–
1784).[57][d] Only Martha and Mary survived to adulthood.[60]
Martha's father John Wayles died in 1773, and the couple inherited 135 slaves, 11,000 acres (45 km2;
17 sq mi), and the estate's debts. The debts took Jefferson years to satisfy, contributing to his financial
problems.[53]
Page 7
Martha later suffered from ill health, including diabetes, and frequent
childbirth further weakened her. Her mother had died young, and Martha
lived with two stepmothers as a girl. A few months after the birth of her
last child, she died on September 6, 1782, with Jefferson at her bedside.
Shortly before her death, Martha made Jefferson promise never to marry
again, telling him that she could not bear to have another mother raise her
children.[61] Jefferson was grief-stricken by her death, relentlessly pacing
back and forth, nearly to the point of exhaustion. He emerged after three
weeks, taking long rambling rides on secluded roads with his daughter
Martha, by her description "a solitary witness to many a violent burst of
grief".[60][62]
After working as secretary of state (1790–93), he returned to Monticello
and initiated a remodeling based on the architectural concepts which he
had acquired in Europe. The work continued throughout most of his
presidency and was completed in 1809.[63][64]

Revolutionary War
Declaration of Independence
Jefferson was the primary author of the Declaration of
Independence. The document's social and political ideals were
proposed by Jefferson before the inauguration of Washington.[65]
 At age 33, he was one of the youngest delegates to the Second
Continental Congress beginning in 1775 at the outbreak of the
 American Revolutionary War, where a formal declaration of
independence from Britain was overwhelmingly favored.[66]
Jefferson chose his words for the Declaration in June 1775, shortly
after the war had begun, where the idea of independence from
Britain had long since become popular among the colonies. He was
inspired by the Enlightenment ideals of the sanctity of the
individual, as well as by the writings of Locke and
Montesquieu.[67]

He sought out John Adams, an emerging leader of the
Congress.[68] They became close friends and Adams supported
Jefferson's appointment to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Five"] Committee of Five formed to draft a
declaration of independence in furtherance of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Resolution"] Lee Resolution
passed by the Congress, which declared the United Colonies independent. The committee initially thought
that Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson.[e]
Jefferson consulted with other committee members over the next seventeen days and drew on his proposed
draft of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Virginia"] Virginia Constitution, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason"] George Mason's draft of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Declaration_of_Rights"] Virginia Declaration of Rights, and other
sources.[70] The other committee members made some changes, and a final draft was presented to Congress
on June 28, 1776.[71]
The declaration was introduced on Friday, June 28, and Congress began debate over its contents on
Monday, July 1,[71] resulting in the omission of a fourth of the text,[72] including a passage critical of King
George III and "Jefferson's anti-slavery clause".[73][74] Jefferson resented the changes, but he did not speak
Page 8
publicly about the revisions.[f] On July 4, 1776, the Congress [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification#United_States"] ratified the Declaration, and delegates signed
it on August 2; in doing so, they were committing an act of treason against the Crown.[76] Jefferson's
preamble is regarded as an enduring statement of human rights, and the phrase "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal"] all men are created equal"
has been called "one of the best-known sentences in the English language" containing "the most potent and
consequential words in American history".[73][77]
Virginia state legislator and governor
At the start of the Revolution, Jefferson was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_(United_States)"] colonel and was
named commander of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albemarle_County,_Virginia"] Albemarle County Militia on
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_House_of_Delegates"] September 26, 1775.[78] He was then elected to the Virginia
House of Delegates for Albemarle County in September 1776,
when finalizing a state constitution was a priority.[79][80]For
nearly three years, he assisted with the constitution and was
especially proud of his Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom,
which forbade state support of religious institutions or
enforcement of religious doctrine.[81] The bill failed to pass, as
did his legislation to disestablish the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglican_Church"] Anglican Church, but both
were later revived by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison.[82] 
 Governor's Palace, Governor
Jefferson's residence in Williamsburg
In 1778, Jefferson was given the task of revising the state's laws. He drafted 126 bills in three years,
including laws to streamline the judicial system. Jefferson's proposed statutes provided for general
education, which he considered the basis of "republican government".[79] He had become alarmed that
Virginia's powerful landed gentry were becoming a hereditary aristocracy. He took the lead in abolishing
what he called "feudal and unnatural distinctions." He targeted laws such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entail"] entail and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture"] primogeniture by
which the oldest son inherited all the land. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee_tail"] entail laws made it perpetual: the one who inherited the land
could not sell it, but had to bequeath it to his oldest son. As a result, increasingly large plantations, worked
by white tenant farmers and by black slaves, gained in size and wealth and political power in the eastern
("Tidewater") tobacco areas.[83] During the Revolutionary era, all such laws were repealed by the states
that had them.[84]
Jefferson was elected [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia"] governor for one-year terms in 1779 and 1780.[85] He transferred the state capital
from Williamsburg to Richmond, and introduced measures for public education, religious freedom, and
revision of inheritance laws.[86]
During General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Arnold"] Benedict Arnold's 1781 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_of_Richmond"] invasion of Virginia, Jefferson escaped Richmond just ahead of
the British forces, and the city being razed by Arnold's men.[87][88] Jefferson sent an emergency dispatch to
Colonel [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampson_Mathews"] Sampson Mathews, whose militia was traveling nearby, to thwart Arnold's efforts.[89][90] During
this time, Jefferson was living with friends in the surrounding counties of Richmond. One of these friends
was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fleming_(judge)"] William Fleming, a college friend of his. Jefferson stayed at least one night at his plantation
 Summerville in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesterfield_County,_Virginia"] Chesterfield County.[91] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cornwallis,_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis"] General Charles Cornwallis that spring dispatched a cavalry force
led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banastre_Tarleton"] Banastre Tarleton to capture Jefferson and members of the Assembly at Monticello, but [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Jouett"] Jack Jouett
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_militia"] Virginia militia thwarted the British plan. Jefferson escaped to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poplar_Forest"] Poplar Forest, his plantation to the
west.[92] When the General Assembly reconvened in June 1781, it conducted an inquiry into Jefferson's
actions which eventually concluded that Jefferson had acted with honor—but he was not re-elected.[93]
In April of the same year, his daughter Lucy died at age one. A second daughter of that name was born the
following year, but she died at age three.[94]

Page 9
In 1782, Jefferson refused a partnership offer by North Carolina Governor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abner_Nash"] Abner Nash, in a profiteering
land scheme sale of confiscated Loyalist lands.[95] Unlike other Founders, in the pursuit of land, Jefferson
 was content with his Monticello estate and the land he owned in the vicinity of Virginia's Shenandoah
Valley. Jefferson wanted Monticello to be an intellectual gathering place for his friends [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison and
 James Monroe.[96]
Notes on the State of Virginia
Jefferson received a letter of inquiry in 1780 about the geography, history, and government of Virginia from
French diplomat [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Barb%C3%A9-Marbois"] François Barbé-Marbois, who was gathering data on the United States. Jefferson included
his written responses in a book, Notes on the State of Virginia (1785).[97] He compiled the book over five
years, including reviews of scientific knowledge, Virginia's history, politics, laws, culture, and
geography.[98] The book explores what constitutes a good society, using Virginia as an exemplar. Jefferson
included extensive data about the state's natural resources and economy and wrote at length about slavery,
miscegenation, and his belief that blacks and whites could not live together as free people in one society
because of justified resentments of the enslaved.[99] He also wrote of his views on the American Indian and
considered them as equals in body and mind to European settlers.[100][101]
 Notes was first published in 1785 in French and appeared in English in 1787.[102] Biographer George
Tucker considered the work "surprising in the extent of the information which a single individual had been
thus able to acquire, as to the physical features of the state",[103] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_D._Peterson"] Merrill D. Peterson described it as an
accomplishment for which all Americans should be grateful.[104]
Member of Congress
The United States formed a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_the_Confederation"] Congress of the Confederation
following victory in the Revolutionary War and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)"] peace treaty with
Great Britain in 1783, to which Jefferson was appointed as a
Virginia delegate. He was a member of the committee setting
foreign exchange rates and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_for_Establishing_Uniformity_in_the_Coinage,_Weights,_and_Measures_of_the_United_States"] recommended an American currency
based on the decimal system which was adopted.[105] He advised
the formation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_the_States"] Committee of the States to fill the power
vacuum when Congress was in recess.[106] The Committee met
when Congress adjourned, but disagreements rendered it
dysfunctional.[107] 
Independence Hall Assembly Room
where Jefferson served in Congress
In the Congress's 1783–84 session, Jefferson acted as chairman of
committees to establish a viable system of government for the new Republic and to propose a policy for the
settlement of the western territories. Jefferson was the principal author of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Ordinance_of_1784"] Land Ordinance of 1784,
 whereby Virginia ceded to the national government the vast area that it claimed northwest of the Ohio
River. He insisted that this territory should not be used as colonial territory by any of the thirteen states, but
that it should be divided into sections that could become states. He plotted borders for nine new states in
their initial stages and wrote an ordinance banning slavery in all the nation's territories. Congress made
extensive revisions, including rejection of the ban on slavery.[108][109] The provisions banning slavery
were known later as the "Jefferson Proviso;" they were modified and implemented three years later in the
 Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and became the law for the entire Northwest.[108]
Minister to France
Page 10
 In 1784, Jefferson was sent by the Congress of the
Confederation[g] to join Benjamin Franklin and John Adams in
Paris as Minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plenipotentiary"] Plenipotentiary for Negotiating Treaties of Amity
and Commerce with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain"] Great Britain, Russia, Austria, Prussia,
Denmark, Saxony, Hamburg, Spain, Portugal, Naples, Sardinia,
 The Papal States, Venice, Genoa, Tuscany, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Porte"] Sublime Porte,
Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli.[110] Some believed that the
recently widowed Jefferson was depressed and that the assignment
would distract him from his wife's death.[111] With his young
daughter Patsy and two servants, he departed in July 1784, arriving
in Paris the next month.[112][113] Less than a year later he was
assigned the additional duty of succeeding Franklin as Minister to
France. French foreign minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Gravier,_comte_de_Vergennes"] Count de Vergennes commented,
"You replace Monsieur Franklin, I hear." Jefferson replied, "I
succeed. No man can replace him."[114] During his five years in
Portrait of Thomas Jefferson while in
 London in 1786 at 44 by Mather 
 Paris, Jefferson played a leading role in shaping the foreign policy
of the United States.[115]
Brown 
Jefferson had Patsy educated at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentemont_Abbey"] Pentemont Abbey. In 1786, he
met and fell in love with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Cosway"] Maria Cosway, an accomplished—and
married—Italian-English musician of 27. They saw each other frequently over a period of six weeks. She
returned to Great Britain, but they maintained a lifelong correspondence.[116]
Jefferson sent for his youngest surviving child, nine-year-old Polly, in June 1787, who was accompanied
on her voyage by a young slave from Monticello, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Hemings"] Sally Hemings. Jefferson had taken her older brother
 James Hemings to Paris as part of his domestic staff and had him trained in French cuisine.[117] According
to Sally's son, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Hemings"] Madison Hemings, the 16-year-old Sally and Jefferson began a sexual relationship in Paris,
where she became pregnant.[118] According to his account, Hemings agreed to return to the United States
only after Jefferson promised to free her children when they came of age.[118]
 While in France, Jefferson became a regular companion of the Marquis de Lafayette, a French hero of the
American Revolutionary War, and Jefferson used his influence to procure trade agreements with
 France.[119][120] As the French Revolution began, Jefferson allowed his Paris residence, the Hôtel de
Langeac, to be used for meetings by Lafayette and other republicans. He was in Paris during the storming
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen"] of the Bastille[121] and consulted with Lafayette while the latter drafted the Declaration of the Rights of
Man and of the Citizen.[122] Jefferson often found his mail opened by postmasters, so he invented his own
enciphering device, the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_disk"] Wheel Cipher"; he wrote important communications in code for the rest of his
career.[123][h] Jefferson left Paris for America in September 1789, intending to return soon; however,
President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"] George Washington appointed him the country's first secretary of state, forcing him to remain in
the nation's capital.[124] Jefferson remained a firm supporter of the French Revolution while opposing its
more violent elements.[125]
Secretary of State
 Soon after returning from France, Jefferson accepted Washington's invitation to serve as secretary of
state.[126] Pressing issues at this time were the national debt and the permanent location of the capital.
 Jefferson opposed a national debt, preferring that each state retire its own, in contrast to Secretary of the
Treasury [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton, who desired consolidation of various states' debts by the federal
government.[127] Hamilton also had bold plans to establish the national credit and a national bank, but
Jefferson strenuously opposed this and attempted to undermine his agenda, which nearly led Washington to
dismiss him from his cabinet. Jefferson later left the cabinet voluntarily.[128]
Page 11
The second major issue was the capital's permanent location. Hamilton
favored a capital close to the major commercial centers of the
Northeast, while Washington, Jefferson, and other agrarians wanted it
 located to the south.[129] After lengthy deadlock, the Compromise of
1790 was struck, permanently locating the capital on the Potomac
River, and the federal government assumed the war debts of all
thirteen states.[129]
While serving in the government in Philadelphia, Jefferson and
 political protegee Congressman James Madison founded the National
Gazette in 1791, along with poet and writer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Freneau"] Phillip Freneau, in an
effort to counter Hamilton's Federalist policies, which Hamilton was
 promoting through the influential Federalist newspaper the Gazette of
the United States. The National Gazette made particular criticism of
the policies promoted by Hamilton, often through anonymous essays
signed by the pen name Brutus at Jefferson's urging, which were
actually written by Madison.[130] In the Spring of 1791, Jefferson and
Madison took a vacation to Vermont. Jefferson had been suffering
from migraines and he was tired of Hamilton in-fighting.[131]

In May 1792, Jefferson was alarmed at the political rivalries taking shape; he wrote to Washington, urging
him to run for re-election that year as a unifying influence.[132] He urged the president to rally the citizenry
to a party that would defend democracy against the corrupting influence of banks and monied interests, as
 espoused by the Federalists. Historians recognize this letter as the earliest delineation of Democratic-
Republican Party principles.[133] Jefferson, Madison, and other Democratic-Republican organizers favored
 states' rights and local control and opposed federal concentration of power, whereas Hamilton sought more
power for the federal government.[134]
Jefferson supported France against Britain when the two nations fought in 1793, though his arguments in
the Cabinet were undercut by French Revolutionary envoy [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmond-Charles_Gen%C3%AAt"] Edmond-Charles Genêt's open scorn for
President Washington.[135] In his discussions with British Minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hammond_(diplomat)"] George Hammond, Jefferson tried
unsuccessfully to persuade the British to vacate their posts in the Northwest and to compensate the U.S. for
slaves whom the British had freed at the end of the war. Seeking a return to private life, Jefferson resigned
the cabinet position in December 1793, perhaps to bolster his political influence from outside the
administration.[136]
After the Washington administration negotiated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Treaty"] Jay Treaty with Great Britain (1794), Jefferson saw a
cause around which to rally his party and organized a national opposition from Monticello.[137] The treaty,
designed by Hamilton, aimed to reduce tensions and increase trade. Jefferson warned that it would increase
British influence and subvert republicanism, calling it "the boldest act [Hamilton and Jay] ever ventured on
to undermine the government".[138] The Treaty passed, but it expired in 1805 during Jefferson's
administration and was not renewed. Jefferson continued his pro-French stance; during the violence of the
 Reign of Terror, he declined to disavow the revolution: "To back away from France would be to undermine
the cause of republicanism in America."[139]
Election of 1796 and vice presidency
In the presidential campaign of 1796, Jefferson lost the electoral college vote to Federalist John Adams by
71–68 and was thus elected vice president. As presiding officer of the Senate, he assumed a more passive
role than his predecessor John Adams. He allowed the Senate to freely conduct debates and confined his
participation to procedural issues, which he called an "honorable and easy" role.[140] Jefferson had
Page 12
previously studied parliamentary law and procedure for 40 years,
making him unusually well qualified to serve as presiding officer.
In 1800, he published his assembled notes on Senate procedure as
 A Manual of Parliamentary Practice.[141] Jefferson would cast
only three [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tie-breaking_votes_cast_by_vice_presidents_of_the_United_States"] tie-breaking votes in the Senate.
Jefferson held four confidential talks with French consul Joseph
Létombe in the spring of 1797 where he attacked Adams,
predicting that his rival would serve only one term. He also
encouraged France to invade England, and advised Létombe to
stall any American envoys sent to Paris by instructing him to "listen
to them and then drag out the negotiations at length and mollify
them by the urbanity of the proceedings."[142] This toughened the
tone that the French government adopted toward the Adams
administration. After Adams's initial peace envoys were rebuffed,
Jefferson and his supporters lobbied for the release of papers related
to the incident, called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XYZ_Affair"] XYZ Affair after the letters used to
disguise the identities of the French officials involved.[143]
However, the tactic backfired when it was revealed that French
officials had demanded bribes, rallying public support against
France. The U.S. began an undeclared naval war with France
known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-War"] Quasi-War.[144] 
1796 election results
During the Adams presidency, the Federalists rebuilt the military,
levied new taxes, and enacted the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts"] Alien and Sedition Acts.
Jefferson believed that these laws were intended to suppress
Democratic-Republicans, rather than prosecute enemy aliens, and
considered them unconstitutional.[145] To rally opposition, he and
 James Madison anonymously wrote the Kentucky and Virginia 
Jefferson in 1799 at 57, painted by
Charles Peale Polk
Resolutions, declaring that the federal government had no right to
exercise powers not specifically delegated to it by the states.[146]
The resolutions followed the "interposition" approach of Madison, in which states may shield their citizens
from federal laws that they deem unconstitutional. Jefferson advocated nullification, allowing states to
invalidate federal laws altogether.[147][i] Jefferson warned that, "unless arrested at the threshold", the Alien
and Sedition Acts would "necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood".[149]
Historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Chernow"] Ron Chernow claims that "the theoretical damage of the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions was
deep and lasting, and was a recipe for disunion", contributing to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"] American Civil War as well as later
events.[150] Washington was so appalled by the resolutions that he told Patrick Henry that, if
"systematically and pertinaciously pursued",  the resolutions would "dissolve the union or produce
coercion."[151]
Jefferson had always admired Washington's leadership skills but felt that his Federalist party was leading
the country in the wrong direction. Jefferson thought it wise not to attend his funeral in 1799 because of
acute differences with Washington while serving as secretary of state, and remained at Monticello.[152]
Election of 1800
In the 1800 presidential election, Jefferson contended once more against Federalist John Adams. Adams's
campaign was weakened by unpopular taxes and vicious Federalist infighting over his actions in the Quasi-
War.[153] Democratic-Republicans pointed to the Alien and Sedition Acts and accused the Federalists of
Page 13
being secret pro-Britain monarchists, while Federalists charged that
Jefferson was a godless libertine in thrall to the French.[154]
Historian Joyce Appleby said the election was "one of the most
acrimonious in the annals of American history".[155]
The Democratic-Republicans ultimately won more electoral college
votes, though without the votes of the extra electors that resulted
from the addition of three-fifths of the South's slaves to the
population calculation, Jefferson would not have defeated John
 Adams.[156] Jefferson and his vice-presidential candidate Aaron
Burr unexpectedly received an equal total. Because of the tie, the 1800 election results
election was decided by the Federalist-dominated House of
Representatives.[157][j] Hamilton lobbied Federalist representatives
on Jefferson's behalf, believing him a lesser political evil than Burr. On February 17, 1801, after thirty-six
ballots, the House elected Jefferson president and Burr vice president. Jefferson became the second
incumbent vice president to be elected president.[158]
The win was marked by Democratic-Republican celebrations throughout the country.[159] Some of
Jefferson's opponents argued that he owed his victory over Adams to the South's inflated number of
electors, due to counting slaves as a partial population under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-Fifths_Compromise"] Three-Fifths Compromise.[160] Others
alleged that Jefferson secured [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Bayard_(elder)"] James Asheton Bayard's tie-breaking electoral vote by guaranteeing the
retention of various Federalist posts in the government.[158] Jefferson disputed the allegation, and the
historical record is inconclusive.[161]
 The transition proceeded smoothly, marking a watershed in American history. As historian Gordon S.
 Wood writes, "it was one of the first popular elections in modern history that resulted in the peaceful
transfer of power from one 'party' to another."[158]
Presidency (1801–1809)
Jefferson was sworn in by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States"] Chief Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall"] John Marshall at the new
Capitol in Washington, D.C. on March 4, 1801. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_inauguration_of_Thomas_Jefferson"] His inauguration
was not attended by outgoing President Adams. In contrast to his
predecessors, Jefferson exhibited a dislike of formal etiquette; he
arrived alone on horseback without escort, dressed plainly[162] and,
after dismounting, retired his own horse to the nearby stable.[163]
His inaugural address struck a note of reconciliation, declaring,
"We have been called by different names brethren of the same
principle. We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists."[164]
Ideologically, Jefferson stressed "equal and exact justice to all
men",  minority rights, and freedom of speech, religion, and
press.[165] He said that a free and democratic government was "the
strongest government on earth."[165] He nominated moderate
Republicans to his cabinet: James Madison as secretary of state,
 Henry Dearborn as secretary of war, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Lincoln_Sr."] Levi Lincoln as attorney
General, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smith_(Cabinet_member)"] Robert Smith as secretary of the navy.[166] 
President Thomas Jefferson
Peale 1805 Reproduction
Jefferson needed a hostess when ladies were present at the White
House. His wife, Martha, had died in 1782. Jefferson's two daughters, Martha Jefferson Randolph and
 Maria Jefferson Eppes, occasionally served in that role.[167] On May 27, 1801, Jefferson asked Dolley
Madison, wife of his long-time friend James Madison, to be the permanent White House hostess. She
Page 14
accepted, realizing the diplomatic importance of the position. She was also in charge of the completion of
the White House mansion. Dolley served as White House hostess for the rest of Jefferson's two terms and
then eight more years as First Lady to President James Madison, Jefferson's successor.[167] Historians have
speculated that Martha Jefferson would have been an elegant First Lady on par with Martha
Washington.[168] Although she died before her husband took office, Martha Jefferson is sometimes
considered a First Lady.[169]
Financial affairs
Upon assuming office, he first confronted an $83 million national debt.[170] He began dismantling
Hamilton's Federalist fiscal system with help from Secretary of the Treasury [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Gallatin"] Albert Gallatin.[166] Jefferson's
administration eliminated the whiskey excise and other taxes after closing "unnecessary offices" and cutting
"useless establishments and expenses".[171][172] They attempted to disassemble the national bank and its
effect of increasing national debt, but were dissuaded by Gallatin.[173] Jefferson shrank the Navy, deeming
it unnecessary in peacetime.[174] Instead, he incorporated a fleet of inexpensive gunboats used only for
defense with the idea that they would not provoke foreign hostilities.[171] After two terms, he had lowered
the national debt from $83 million to $57 million.[170]
Domestic affairs
Jefferson pardoned several of those imprisoned under the Alien and Sedition Acts.[175] Congressional
Republicans repealed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Judges_Act"] Judiciary Act of 1801, which removed nearly all of Adams's "midnight judges"
 from office. A subsequent appointment battle led to the Supreme Court's landmark decision in Marbury v.
 Madison, asserting judicial review over executive branch actions.[176] Jefferson appointed three Supreme
Court justices: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Johnson_(judge)"] William Johnson (1804),  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Brockholst_Livingston"] Henry Brockholst Livingston (1807),  and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Todd"] Thomas Todd
(1807).[177]
Jefferson strongly felt the need for a national military university, producing an officer engineering corps for
a national defense based on the advancement of the sciences, rather than having to rely on foreign sources
for top grade engineers with questionable loyalty.[178] He signed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Peace_Establishment_Act"] Military Peace Establishment Act on
March 16, 1802, thus founding the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Military_Academy"] United States Military Academy at West Point. The Act documented in
29 sections a new set of laws and limits for the military. Jefferson was also hoping to bring reform to the
Executive branch, replacing Federalists and active opponents throughout the officer corps to promote
Republican values.[179]
Jefferson took great interest in the Library of Congress, which had been established in 1800. He often
recommended books to acquire. In 1802, an act of Congress authorized President Jefferson to name the first
Librarian of Congress and gave itself the power to establish library rules and regulations. This act also
granted the president and vice president the right to use the library.[180]
Foreign affairs (1801–1805)
First Barbary War
American merchant ships had been protected from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_Coast"] Barbary Coast pirates by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy"] Royal Navy when the
states were British colonies.[181] After independence, however, pirates often captured U.S. merchant ships,
pillaged cargoes, and enslaved or held crew members for ransom. Jefferson had opposed paying tribute to
the Barbary States since 1785.[182] In March 1786, he and John Adams went to London to negotiate with
Page 15
Tripoli's  envoy, ambassador Sidi Haji
Abdrahaman (or Sidi Haji Abdul Rahman
Adja).[183] In 1801, he authorized a U.S.
Navy fleet under Commodore [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dale"] Richard Dale
to make a  show of force in the
Mediterranean, the first American naval
squadron to cross the Atlantic.[184]
Following the fleet's first engagement, he
successfully asked Congress for a declaration
of war.[184] The subsequent "First Barbary
War" was the first foreign war fought by the
U.S.[185] 
Barbary Coast of North Africa 1806. Left is Morocco at
Gibraltar, center is Tunis, and right is Tripoli.
 Pasha of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripoli"] Tripoli [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_Karamanli"] Yusuf Karamanli captured the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Philadelphia_(1799)"] USS Philadelphia,
so Jefferson authorized [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Eaton_(soldier)"] William Eaton, the U.S. Consul to Tunis, to
lead a force to restore the pasha's older brother to the throne.[187]
The American navy forced Tunis and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers"] Algiers into breaking their
alliance with Tripoli. Jefferson ordered five separate naval
bombardments of Tripoli, leading the pasha to sign a treaty that
restored peace in the Mediterranean.[188] This victory proved only
temporary, but according to Wood, "many Americans celebrated it
as a vindication of their policy of spreading free trade around the
world and as a great victory for liberty over tyranny."[189]
Louisiana Purchase
Spain [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Treaty_of_San_Ildefonso"] ceded ownership of the Louisiana territory in 1800 to the
more predominant France. Jefferson was greatly concerned that
 Napoleon's broad interests in the vast territory would threaten the
security of the continent and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River"] Mississippi River shipping. He wrote
that the cession "works most sorely on the U.S. It completely
reverses all the political relations of the U.S."[190] In 1802, he

with Napoleon to purchase [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans"] New Orleans and adjacent coastal areas
from France.[191] In early 1803, Jefferson offered Napoleon nearly
$10 million for 40,000 square miles (100,000 square kilometers) of
tropical territory.[192] 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Tripoli"] Treaty of Peace and Friendship

size of the United States.[192] U.S. negotiators seized this unique
opportunity and accepted the offer and signed the treaty on April
30, 1803.[170] Word of the unexpected purchase did not reach Jefferson until July 3, 1803.[170] He
unknowingly acquired the most fertile tract of land of its size on Earth, making the new country self-
sufficient in food and other resources. The sale also significantly curtailed the European presence in North
America, removing obstacles to U.S. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_the_United_States"] westward expansion.[193]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%87%D8%AF%D8%A9_%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%B3.pdf"]
Page 16
Most thought that this was an exceptional opportunity, despite Republican reservations about the
Constitutional authority of the federal government to acquire land.[194] Jefferson initially thought that a
Constitutional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Senate_changes"] amendment was necessary to purchase and govern the new territory; but he later changed his
mind, fearing that this would give cause to oppose the purchase, and he, therefore, urged a speedy debate
and ratification.[195] On October 20, 1803, the Senate ratified the purchase treaty by a vote of 24–7.[196]
After the purchase, Jefferson preserved the region's Spanish legal code and instituted a gradual approach
for integrating settlers into American democracy. He believed that a period of federal rule would be
necessary while Louisianians adjusted to their new nation.[197][k] Historians have differed in their
assessments regarding the constitutional implications of the sale,[199] but they typically hail the Louisiana
acquisition as a major accomplishment. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Jackson_Turner"] Frederick Jackson Turner called the purchase the most formative
event in American history.[193]
Lewis and Clark expedition (1803–1806)
Jefferson anticipated further westward settlements due to the
Louisiana Purchase and arranged for the exploration and mapping
of the uncharted territory. He sought to establish a U.S. claim ahead
 of competing European interests and to find the rumored Northwest
Passage.[200] Jefferson and others were influenced by exploration
accounts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine-Simon_Le_Page_du_Pratz"] Le Page du Pratz in Louisiana (1763) and Captain
 James Cook in the Pacific (1784),[201] and they persuaded
Congress in 1804 to fund an expedition to explore and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lewis_and_Clark_Expidition_Map.jpg"] map the
newly acquired territory to the Pacific Ocean.[202] 
Corps of Discovery, October 1805
Jefferson appointed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meriwether_Lewis"] Meriwether Lewis and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Clark"] William Clark to be (by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Marion_Russell"] Charles Marion Russell, 1905)
leaders of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corps_of_Discovery"] Corps of Discovery (1803–1806).[203] In the months
leading up to the expedition, Jefferson tutored Lewis in the sciences
of mapping, botany, natural history, mineralogy, and astronomy and navigation, giving him unlimited
access to his library at Monticello, which included the largest collection of books in the world on the
subject of the geography and natural history of the North American continent, along with an impressive
collection of maps.[204]
The expedition lasted from May 1804 to September 1806 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition"] (see Timeline) and obtained a wealth of scientific
and geographic knowledge, including knowledge of many Indian tribes.[205]
Other expeditions
 In addition to the Corps of Discovery, Jefferson organized three other western expeditions: the William
 Dunbar and George Hunter expedition on the Ouachita River (1804–1805), the Thomas Freeman and Peter
Custis expedition (1806) on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_of_the_South"] Red River, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_Expedition"] Zebulon Pike Expedition (1806–1807) into the Rocky
Mountains and the Southwest. All three produced valuable information about the American frontier.[206]
Indian affairs
Jefferson's experiences with the American Indians began during his boyhood in Virginia and extended
through his political career and into his retirement. He refuted the contemporary notion that Indians were
inferior people and maintained that they were equal in body and mind to people of European descent.[207]
Page 17
As governor of Virginia during the Revolutionary War, Jefferson
recommended moving the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherokee"] Cherokee and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawnee"] Shawnee tribes, who had allied
with the British, to west of the Mississippi River. But when he took office
as president, he quickly took measures to avert another major conflict, as
American and Indian societies were in collision and the British were
inciting Indian tribes from Canada.[208][209] In Georgia, he stipulated that
the state would release its legal claims for lands to its west in exchange for
military support in expelling the Cherokee from Georgia. This facilitated
his policy of western expansion, to "advance compactly as we
multiply".[210]
In keeping with his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment"] Enlightenment thinking, President Jefferson adopted
an assimilation policy toward American Indians known as his
"civilization program" which included securing peaceful U.S. – Indian
treaty alliances and encouraging agriculture. Jefferson advocated that
Indian tribes should make federal purchases by credit holding their lands

policies.
as collateral for repayment. Various tribes accepted Jefferson's policies,
including the Shawnees led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hoof"] Black Hoof, the Creek, and the Cherokees. However, some Shawnees
broke off from Black Hoof, led by Tecumseh, and opposed Jefferson's assimilation policies.[211]
Historian Bernard Sheehan argues that Jefferson believed that assimilation was best for American Indians;
second best was removal to the west. He felt that the worst outcome of the cultural and resources conflict
between American citizens and American Indians would be their attacking the whites.[209] Jefferson told
Secretary of War General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dearborn"] Henry Dearborn (Indian affairs were then under the War Department), "If we are
constrained to lift the hatchet against any tribe, we will never lay it down until that tribe is exterminated or
driven beyond the Mississippi."[212] Miller agrees that Jefferson believed that Indians should assimilate to
American customs and agriculture. Historians such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_S._Onuf"] Peter S. Onuf and Merrill D. Peterson argue that
Jefferson's actual Indian policies did little to promote assimilation and were a pretext to seize lands.[213]
Re-election in 1804 and second term
Jefferson's successful first term occasioned his re-nomination for
president by the Republican party, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clinton_(vice_president)"] George Clinton replacing
 Burr as his running mate.[214] The Federalist party ran Charles
Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina, John Adams's vice-
presidential candidate in the 1800 election. The Jefferson-Clinton
ticket won overwhelmingly in the electoral college vote, by 162 to
14, promoting their achievement of a strong economy, lower taxes,
and the Louisiana Purchase.[214]
In March 1806, a split developed in the Republican party, led by
fellow Virginian and former Republican ally [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Randolph_of_Roanoke"] John Randolph who
viciously accused President Jefferson on the floor of the House of
moving too far in the Federalist direction. In so doing, Randolph 1804 Electoral College vote
permanently set himself apart [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertium_quids"] politically from Jefferson. Jefferson
and Madison had backed resolutions to limit or ban British imports
in retaliation for British seizures of American shipping. Also, in 1808, Jefferson was the first president to
propose a broad Federal plan to build roads and canals across several states, asking for $20 million, further
alarming Randolph and believers of limited government.[215]
Page 18
Jefferson's popularity further suffered in his second term due to his response to wars in Europe. Positive
relations with Great Britain had diminished, due partly to the antipathy between Jefferson and British
diplomat [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Merry"] Anthony Merry. After Napoleon's decisive victory at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Austerlitz"] Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, Napoleon
became more aggressive in his negotiations over trading rights, which American efforts failed to counter.
Jefferson then led the enactment of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embargo_Act_of_1807"] Embargo Act of 1807, directed at both France and Great Britain.
This triggered economic chaos in the U.S. and was strongly criticized at the time, resulting in Jefferson
having to abandon the policy a year later.[216]
During the revolutionary era, the states abolished the international slave trade, but South Carolina reopened
it. In his annual message of December 1806, Jefferson denounced the "violations of human rights"
attending the international slave trade, calling on the newly elected Congress to criminalize it immediately.
In 1807, Congress passed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_Prohibiting_Importation_of_Slaves"] Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves, which Jefferson signed.[217][218] The
act established severe punishment against the international slave trade, although it did not address the issue
domestically.[219]
In Haiti, Jefferson's neutrality had allowed arms to enable the slave independence movement during its
Revolution, and blocked attempts to assist Napoleon, who was defeated there in 1803.[220] But he refused
official recognition of the country during his second term, in deference to southern complaints about the
racial violence against slave-holders; it was eventually extended to Haiti in 1862.[221]
Domestically, Jefferson's grandson James Madison Randolph became the first child born in the White
House in 1806.[222]
Controversies
Burr conspiracy and trial 
Following the 1801 electoral deadlock, Jefferson's relationship with his
vice president, former New York Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr"] Aaron Burr, rapidly eroded.
Jefferson suspected Burr of seeking the presidency for himself, while
Burr was angered by Jefferson's refusal to appoint some of his supporters
to federal office. Burr was dropped from the Republican ticket in 1804.
The same year, Burr was soundly defeated in his bid to be elected New
York governor. During the campaign, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton publicly made
callous remarks regarding Burr's moral character.[223] Subsequently, Burr
challenged Hamilton to a duel, mortally wounding him on July 11, 1804.
Burr was indicted for Hamilton's murder in New York and New Jersey,
causing him to flee to Georgia, although he remained President of the
1802 portrait of Aaron Burr by
 John Vanderlyn 
Senate during Supreme Court Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Chase"] Samuel Chase's impeachment
trial.[224] Both indictments quietly died and Burr was not prosecuted.[225]
Also during the election, certain New England separatists approached
Burr, desiring a New England federation and intimating that he would be
their leader.[226] However, nothing came of the plot, since Burr had lost
the election and his reputation was ruined after killing Hamilton.[226] In August 1804, Burr contacted
British Minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Merry"] Anthony Merry offering to cede U.S. western territory in return for money and British
ships.[227]
Page 19
After leaving office in April 1805, Burr traveled west and conspired with Louisiana Territory governor
 James Wilkinson, beginning a large-scale recruitment for a military expedition.[228] Other plotters included
Ohio Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smith_(Ohio_Senator)"] John Smith and an Irishman named [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harman_Blennerhassett"] Harmon Blennerhassett.[228] Burr discussed a number of
plots—seizing control of Mexico or Spanish Florida, or forming a secessionist state in New Orleans or the
Western U.S. Historians remain unclear as to his true goal.[229][l]
In the fall of 1806, Burr launched a military flotilla carrying about 60 men down the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_River"] Ohio River. Wilkinson
renounced the plot, apparently from self-interested motives; he reported Burr's expedition to Jefferson, who
immediately ordered Burr's arrest.[228][231][232] On February 13, 1807, Burr was captured in Louisiana's
Bayou Pierre wilderness and sent to Virginia to be tried for treason.[227]
Burr's 1807 conspiracy trial became a national issue.[233] Jefferson attempted to preemptively influence the
verdict by telling Congress that Burr's guilt was "beyond question", but the case came before his longtime
political foe [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall"] John Marshall, who dismissed the treason charge. Burr's legal team at one stage subpoenaed
Jefferson, but Jefferson refused to testify, making the first argument for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_privilege"] executive privilege. Instead,
Jefferson provided relevant legal documents.[234] After a three-month trial, the jury found Burr not guilty,
while Jefferson denounced his acquittal.[232][235][m][236] Jefferson subsequently removed Wilkinson as
territorial governor but retained him in the U.S. military. Historian James N. Banner criticized Jefferson for
continuing to trust Wilkinson, a "faithless plotter".[232]
General Wilkinson misconduct
Commanding General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wilkinson"] James Wilkinson was a holdover of the Washington and Adams administrations.
Wilkinson was rumored to be a "skillful and unscrupolous plotter". In 1804, Wilkinson received 12,000
pesos from the Spanish for information on American boundary plans.[237] Wilkinson also received
advances on his salary and payments on claims submitted to Secretary of War [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dearborn"] Henry Dearborn. This
damaging information apparently was unknown to Jefferson. In 1805, Jefferson trusted Wilkinson and
appointed him Louisiana Territory governor, admiring Wilkinson's work ethic. In January 1806 Jefferson
received information from Kentucky U.S. Attorney Joseph Davies that Wilkinson was on the Spanish
payroll. Jefferson took no action against Wilkinson, there being, at the time, a lack of evidence against
Wilkinson.[238] An investigation by the House in December 1807 exonerated Wilkinson.[239] In 1808, a
military court looked into Wilkinson but lacked evidence to charge Wilkinson. Jefferson retained Wilkinson
in the Army and he was passed on by Jefferson to Jefferson's successor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison.[240] Evidence
found in Spanish archives in the twentieth century proved Wilkinson was, in fact, on the Spanish
payroll.[237]
Foreign Affairs (1805–1809)
Attempted annexation of Florida
In the aftermath of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase"] Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson attempted to annex [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_West_Florida"] West Florida from Spain, a nation
under the control of Emperor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon"] Napoleon and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_French_Empire"] French Empire after 1804. In his annual message to
Congress, on December 3, 1805, Jefferson railed against Spain over Florida border depredations.[241][242]
A few days later Jefferson secretly requested a two million dollar expenditure to purchase Florida.
Representative and floor leader [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Randolph_of_Roanoke"] John Randolph, however, opposed annexation and was upset over
Jefferson's secrecy on the matter, and believed the money would land in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffers"] coffers of Napoleon.[243][242]
The Two Million Dollar bill passed only after Jefferson successfully maneuvered to replace Randolph with
 Barnabas Bidwell as floor leader.[243][242] This aroused suspicion of Jefferson and charges of undue
executive influence over Congress. Jefferson signed the bill into law in February 1806. Six weeks later the
Page 20
law was made public. The two million dollars was to be given to France as payment, in turn, to put
pressure on Spain to permit the annexation of Florida by the United States. France, however, was in no
mood to allow Spain to give up Florida and refused the offer. Florida remained under the control of
Spain.[244][242] The failed venture damaged Jefferson's reputation among his supporters.[245][242]
Chesapeake–Leopard affair and Embargo Act
The British conducted seizures of American shipping
to search for British deserters from 1806 to 1807;
American citizens were thus impressed into the British
naval service. In 1806, Jefferson issued a call for a
boycott of British goods; on April 18, Congress passed
the Non-Importation Acts, but they were never
enforced. Later that year, Jefferson asked James
Monroe and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pinkney"] William Pinkney to negotiate with Great
Britain to end the harassment of American shipping, HMS Leopard (right) firing upon USS Chesapeake
though Britain showed no signs of improving
relations. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe%E2%80%93Pinkney_Treaty"] Monroe–Pinkney Treaty was finalized
but lacked any provisions to end the British policies, and Jefferson refused to submit it to the Senate for
ratification.[246]
The British ship [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Leopard_(1790)"] HMS Leopard fired upon the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Chesapeake_(1799)"] USS Chesapeake off the Virginia coast in June 1807, and
Jefferson prepared for war.[247] He issued a proclamation banning armed British ships from U.S. waters.
He presumed unilateral authority to call on the states to prepare 100,000 militia and ordered the purchase of
arms, ammunition, and supplies, writing, "The laws of necessity, of self-preservation, of saving our country
when in danger, are of higher obligation [than strict observance of written laws]". The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Revenge_(1806)"] USS Revenge was
dispatched to demand an explanation from the British government; it also was fired upon. Jefferson called
for a special session of Congress in October to enact an embargo or alternatively to consider war.[248]
In December, news arrived that Napoleon had extended the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Decree"] Berlin Decree, globally banning British
imports. In Britain, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom"] King George III ordered redoubling efforts at impressment, including American sailors.
But the war fever of the summer faded; Congress had no appetite to prepare the U.S. for war. Jefferson
asked for and received the Embargo Act, an alternative that allowed the U.S. more time to build up
defensive works, militias, and naval forces. Later historians have seen irony in Jefferson's assertion of such
federal power. Meacham claims that the Embargo Act was a projection of power which surpassed the Alien
and Sedition Acts, and R. B. Bernstein writes that Jefferson "was pursuing policies resembling those he
had cited in 1776 as grounds for independence and revolution".[249]
Secretary of State James Madison supported the embargo with equal vigor to Jefferson,[250] while Treasury
Secretary Gallatin opposed it, due to its indefinite time frame and the risk that it posed to the policy of
American neutrality.[251] The U.S. economy suffered, criticism grew, and opponents began evading the
embargo. Instead of retreating, Jefferson sent federal agents to secretly track down smugglers and
violators.[252] Three acts were passed in Congress during 1807 and 1808, called the Supplementary, the
Additional, and the Enforcement acts.[247] The government could not prevent American vessels from
trading with the European belligerents once they had left American ports, although the embargo triggered a
devastating decline in exports.[247]
Most historians consider Jefferson's embargo to have been ineffective and harmful to American
interests.[253] Appleby describes the strategy as Jefferson's "least effective policy", and Joseph Ellis calls it
"an unadulterated calamity".[254] Others, however, portray it as an innovative, nonviolent measure which
aided France in its war with Britain while preserving American neutrality.[255] Jefferson believed that the
Page 21
failure of the embargo was due to selfish traders and merchants
showing a lack of "republican virtue." He maintained that, had the
embargo been widely observed, it would have avoided war in
1812.[256]
In December 1807, Jefferson announced his intention not to seek a
third term. He turned his attention increasingly to Monticello during
the last year of his presidency, giving Madison and Gallatin almost
total control of affairs.[257] Shortly before leaving office in March
1809, Jefferson signed the repeal of the Embargo. In its place, the
 Non-Intercourse Act was passed, but it proved no more
effective.[247] The day before Madison was inaugurated as his
successor, Jefferson said that he felt like "a prisoner, released from
his chains".[258]

Following his retirement from the presidency, Jefferson continued
his pursuit of educational interests; he sold his vast collection of
books to the Library of Congress, and founded and built the
University of Virginia.[259] Jefferson continued to correspond with
many of the country's leaders (including his two protégées who
succeeded him as president), and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine"] Monroe Doctrine bears a
strong resemblance to solicited advice that Jefferson gave to
Monroe in 1823.[260] As he settled into private life at Monticello,
Jefferson developed a daily routine of rising early. He would spend
several hours writing letters, with which he was often deluged. In
the midday, he would often inspect the plantation on horseback. In
the evenings, his family enjoyed leisure time in the gardens; late at
night, Jefferson would retire to bed with a book.[261] However, his
routine was often interrupted by uninvited visitors and tourists
eager to see the icon in his final days, turning Monticello into "a
virtual hotel".[262]  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Stuart"] Portrait of Jefferson by Gilbert
Stuart, 1821.
University of Virginia
Jefferson envisioned a university free of church influences where
students could specialize in many new areas not offered at other
colleges. He believed that education engendered a stable society,
which should provide publicly funded schools accessible to
students from all social strata, based solely on ability.[263] He
initially proposed his University in a letter to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Priestley"] Joseph Priestley in
1800[264] and, in 1819, the 76-year-old Jefferson founded the
University of Virginia. He organized the state legislative campaign
for its charter and, with the assistance of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Bacon_(1785%E2%80%931866)"] Edmund Bacon, 
The University of Virginia,
Jefferson's "Academical Village"
purchased the location. He was the principal designer of the
buildings, planned the university's curriculum, and served as the first rector upon its opening in 1825.[265]
Jefferson was a strong disciple of Greek and Roman architectural styles, which he believed to be most
representative of American democracy. Each academic unit, called a pavilion, was designed with a two-
story temple front, while the library "Rotunda" was modeled on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome"] Roman Pantheon. Jefferson referred to
the university's grounds as the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lawn"] Academical Village," and he reflected his educational ideas in its layout.
The ten pavilions included classrooms and faculty residences; they formed a quadrangle and were
connected by colonnades, behind which stood the students' rows of rooms. Gardens and vegetable plots
were placed behind the pavilions and were surrounded by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crinkle_crankle_wall"] serpentine walls, affirming the importance of the
agrarian lifestyle.[266] The university had a library rather than a church at its center, emphasizing its secular
nature—a controversial aspect at the time.[267]
When Jefferson died in 1826, James Madison replaced him as rector.[268] Jefferson bequeathed most of his
library to the university.[269] Only one other ex-president has founded a university, namely [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millard_Fillmore"] Millard Fillmore
who founded the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_at_Buffalo"] University at Buffalo.
Reconciliation with Adams
Jefferson and John Adams had been good friends in the first decades of their political careers, serving
together in the Continental Congress in the 1770s and in Europe in the 1780s. The Federalist/Republican
split of the 1790s divided them, however, and Adams felt betrayed by Jefferson's sponsorship of partisan
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lawn_UVa_Rotunda_Pavilions_II_and_IV.jpg"]
Page 23
attacks, such as those of James Callender. Jefferson, on the other
hand, was angered at Adams for his appointment of "midnight
judges".[270] The two men did not communicate directly for more
than a decade after Jefferson succeeded Adams as president.[271] A
brief correspondence took place between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail_Adams"] Abigail Adams and
Jefferson after Jefferson's daughter Polly died in 1804, in an
attempt at reconciliation unknown to Adams. However, an
exchange of letters resumed open hostilities between Adams and
Jefferson.[270]
As early as 1809, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Rush"] Benjamin Rush, signer of the Declaration of
Independence, desired that Jefferson and Adams reconcile and
began to prod the two through correspondence to re-establish
contact.[270] In 1812, Adams wrote a short New Year's greeting to
Jefferson, prompted earlier by Rush, to which Jefferson warmly
responded. Thus began what historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McCullough"] David McCullough calls
"one of the most extraordinary correspondences in American
history".[272] Over the next fourteen years, the former presidents

exchanged 158 letters discussing their political differences,
justifying their respective roles in events, and debating the revolution's import to the world.[273] When
Adams died, his last words included an acknowledgment of his longtime friend and rival: "Thomas
Jefferson survives", unaware that Jefferson had died several hours before.[274][275]
Autobiography
In 1821, at the age of 77, Jefferson began writing his autobiography, in order to "state some recollections of
dates and facts concerning myself".[276] He focused on the struggles and achievements he experienced
until July 29, 1790, where the narrative stopped short.[277] He excluded his youth, emphasizing the
revolutionary era. He related that his ancestors came from Wales to America in the early 17th century and
settled in the western frontier of the Virginia colony, which influenced his zeal for individual and state
rights. Jefferson described his father as uneducated, but with a "strong mind and sound judgement". His
enrollment in the College of William and Mary and election to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia in
1775 were included.[276]
He also expressed opposition to the idea of a privileged [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy"] aristocracy made up of large landowning families
partial to the King, and instead promoted "the aristocracy of virtue and talent, which nature has wisely
provided for the direction of the interests of society, & scattered with equal hand through all its conditions,
was deemed essential to a well-ordered republic".[276]
Jefferson gave his insight into people, politics, and events.[276] The work is primarily concerned with the
Declaration and reforming the government of Virginia. He used notes, letters, and documents to tell many
of the stories within the autobiography. He suggested that this history was so rich that his personal affairs
were better overlooked, but he incorporated a self-analysis using the Declaration and other patriotism.[278]
Greek War of Independence
Thomas Jefferson was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philhellene"] philhellene who sympathized with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_War_of_Independence"] Greek War of Independence.[279][280] He
has been described as the most influential of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States"] Founding Fathers who supported the Greek
cause,[280][281] viewing it as similar to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution"] American Revolution.[282] By 1823, Jefferson was exchanging
ideas with Greek scholar [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamantios_Korais"] Adamantios Korais.[280] Jefferson advised Korais on building the political system
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gilbert_Stuart,_Abigail_Smith_Adams_(Mrs._John_Adams),_1800-1815,_NGA_42934.jpg"]
Page 24
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"] Greece by using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism"] classical liberalism and examples from the American governmental system, ultimately
 prescribing a government akin to that of a U.S. State.[283] He also suggested the application of a classical
education system for the newly founded [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Hellenic_Republic"] First Hellenic Republic, where public education would be made
available and pupils would be taught history, Latin, and Greek.[284] Jefferson's philosophical instructions
were welcomed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_people"] Greek people.[284] Korais became one of the designers of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_constitution"] Greek constitution
and urged his associates to study Jefferson's works and other literature from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution"] American Revolution.[284]
Lafayette's visit
In the summer of 1824, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_du_Motier,_Marquis_de_Lafayette"] Marquis de Lafayette accepted an invitation
from President James Monroe to visit the country. Jefferson and Lafayette
 had not seen each other since 1789. After visits to New York, New
England, and Washington, Lafayette arrived at Monticello on November
4.[265]
Jefferson's grandson [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_Randolph"] Randolph was present and recorded the reunion: "As
they approached each other, their uncertain gait quickened itself into a
shuffling run, and exclaiming, 'Ah Jefferson!'  'Ah Lafayette!', they burst
into tears as they fell into each other's arms." Jefferson and Lafayette then
retired to the house to reminisce.[285] The next morning Jefferson,
Lafayette, and James Madison attended a tour and banquet at the
University of Virginia. Jefferson had someone else read a speech he had
prepared for Lafayette, as his voice was weak and could not carry. This
was his last public presentation. After an 11-day visit, Lafayette bid
Jefferson goodbye and departed Monticello.[286]

Representatives
Jefferson's approximately $100,000 of debt weighed heavily on his mind in
his final months, as it became increasingly clear that he would have little to
leave to his heirs. In February 1826, he successfully applied to the General
Assembly to hold a public lottery as a fundraiser.[287] His health began to
deteriorate in July 1825, due to a combination of rheumatism from arm and
wrist injuries, as well as intestinal and urinary disorders[265] and, by June
1826, he was confined to bed.[287] On July 3, Jefferson was overcome by
fever and declined an invitation to Washington to attend an anniversary
celebration of the Declaration.[288]
During the last hours of his life, he was accompanied by family members
Jefferson's gravesite 
and friends. Jefferson died on July 4 at 12:50 p.m. at age 83, the same day
as the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. His last
recorded words were "No, doctor, nothing more," refusing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laudanum"] laudanum from
his physician, but his final significant words are often cited as "Is it the
Fourth?" or "This is the Fourth."[289] When [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams"] John Adams died later that same day, his last words included
an acknowledgment of his longtime friend and rival: "Thomas Jefferson survives," though Adams was
unaware that Jefferson had died several hours before.[290][291][292][293] The sitting president was Adams's
son, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams"] John Quincy Adams, and he called the coincidence of their deaths on the nation's anniversary "visible
and palpable remarks of Divine Favor."[294]
Page 25
Shortly after Jefferson had died, attendants found a gold locket on a chain around his neck, where it had
rested for more than 40 years, containing a small faded blue ribbon that tied a lock of his wife Martha's
brown hair.[295]
Jefferson's remains were buried at Monticello, under an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitaph"] epitaph that he wrote:
HERE WAS BURIED THOMAS JEFFERSON, AUTHOR OF THE DECLARATION OF
AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE, OF THE STATUTE OF VIRGINIA FOR RELIGIOUS
FREEDOM, AND FATHER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.[296]
In his advanced years, Jefferson became increasingly concerned that people understand the principles in,
and the people responsible for writing, the Declaration of Independence, and he continually defended
himself as its author. He considered the document one of his greatest life achievements, in addition to
authoring the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Virginia_for_Religious_Freedom"] Statute of Virginia for Religious Freedom and his founding of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia"] University of Virginia.
Plainly absent from his epitaph were his political roles, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"] President of the United States.[297]
Jefferson died deeply in debt, unable to pass on his estate freely to his heirs.[298] He gave instructions in his
will for disposal of his assets,[299] including the freeing of Sally Hemings's children;[300] but his estate,
possessions, and slaves were sold at public auctions starting in 1827.[301] In 1831, Monticello was sold by
 Martha Jefferson Randolph and the other heirs.[302]
Political, social, and religious views
Jefferson subscribed to the political ideals expounded by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke"] John Locke, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon"] Francis Bacon, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton"] Isaac Newton,
whom he considered the three greatest men who ever lived.[4][5] He was also influenced by the writings of
Gibbon, Hume, Robertson, Bolingbroke, Montesquieu, and Voltaire.[6] Jefferson thought that the
independent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeoman#United_States"] yeoman and agrarian life were ideals of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States"] republican virtues. He distrusted cities and financiers,
favored decentralized government power, and believed that the tyranny that had plagued the common man
in Europe was due to corrupt political establishments and monarchies. He supported efforts to disestablish
 the Church of England,[303] wrote the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and he pressed for a wall of
separation between church and state.[304] The Republicans under Jefferson were strongly influenced by the
 18th-century British Whig Party, which believed in limited government.[305] His Democratic-Republican
 Party became dominant in early American politics, and his views became known as Jeffersonian
democracy.[306][307]
Society and government
Jefferson wrote letters and speeches prolifically, and these show him to be conversant and well read in the
philosophical literature of his day and of antiquity. However, since Jefferson did not produce a formal work
on philosophy, scholars, in general, do not take him seriously as a philosopher. Nonetheless, Jefferson left
behind a "rich philosophical legacy" in his presidential messages, letters to philosophically minded people,
and his public papers.[308]
According to Jefferson's philosophy, citizens have "certain inalienable rights" and "rightful liberty is
unobstructed action according to our will, within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others."[309]
A staunch advocate of the jury system to protect people's liberties, he proclaimed in 1801, "I consider [trial
by jury] as the only anchor yet imagined by man, by which a government can be held to the principles of its
constitution."[310]Jeffersonian government not only prohibited individuals in society from infringing on the
 liberty of others, but also restrained itself from diminishing individual liberty as a protection against tyranny
Page 26
 from the majority.[311] Initially, Jefferson favored restricted voting to those who could actually have the free
exercise of their reason by escaping any corrupting dependence on others. He advocated enfranchising a
majority of Virginians, seeking to expand suffrage to include "yeoman farmers" who owned their own land
while excluding tenant farmers, city day laborers, vagrants, most Amerindians, and women.[312]
He was convinced that individual liberties were the fruit of political equality, which were threatened by
arbitrary government.[313] Excesses of democracy in his view were caused by institutional corruption rather
than human nature. He was less suspicious of a working democracy than many contemporaries.[312] As
president, Jefferson feared that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism_in_the_United_States"] Federalist system enacted by Washington and Adams had encouraged
corrupting patronage and dependence. He tried to restore a balance between the state and federal
governments more nearly reflecting the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation"] Articles of Confederation, seeking to reinforce state prerogatives
where his party was in a majority.[312]
Jefferson was steeped in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whigs_(British_political_party)"] British Whig tradition of the oppressed majority set against a repeatedly
unresponsive court party in the Parliament. He justified small outbreaks of rebellion as necessary to get
monarchial regimes to amend oppressive measures compromising popular liberties. In a republican regime
ruled by the majority, he acknowledged "it will often be exercised when wrong."[314] But "the remedy is to
set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them."[315] As Jefferson saw his party triumph in two terms of
his presidency and launch into a third term under James Madison, his view of the U.S. as a continental
republic and an "empire of liberty" grew more upbeat. On departing the presidency in 1809, he described
America as "trusted with the destines of this solitary republic of the world, the only monument of human
rights, and the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self-government."[316]
Democracy
Jefferson considered democracy to be the expression of society and
promoted national self-determination, cultural uniformity, and
education of all males of the commonwealth.[317] He supported
public education and a free press as essential components of a
democratic nation.[318]
After resigning as secretary of state in 1795, Jefferson focused on
the electoral bases of the Republicans and Federalists. The
"Republican" classification for which he advocated included "the
entire body of landholders" everywhere and "the body of laborers"
without land.[319] Republicans united behind Jefferson as vice
president, with the election of 1796 expanding democracy
nationwide at grassroots levels.[320] Jefferson promoted Republican
candidates for local offices.[321]
Beginning with Jefferson's electioneering for the "revolution of
1800," his political efforts were based on egalitarian appeals.[322]
In his later years, he referred to the 1800 election "as real a
revolution in the principles of our government as that of '76 was in
its form," one "not effected indeed by the sword ... but by the ...
suffrage of the people."[323] Voter participation grew during

compared to the Federalist Era, with turnout of about 67,000 in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1800_United_States_presidential_election"] 1800 rising to about 143,000 in 1804.[324]
Page 27
At the onset of the Revolution, Jefferson accepted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Blackstone"] William Blackstone's argument that property ownership
would sufficiently empower voters' independent judgement, but he sought to further expand suffrage by
land distribution to the poor.[325] In the heat of the Revolutionary Era and afterward, several states
expanded voter eligibility from landed gentry to all propertied male, tax-paying citizens with Jefferson's
support.[326] In retirement, he gradually became critical of his home state for violating "the principle of
equal political rights"—the social right of universal male suffrage.[327] He sought a "general suffrage" of all
taxpayers and militia-men, and equal representation by population in the General Assembly to correct
preferential treatment of the slave-holding regions.[328]
Religion
Baptized in his youth, Jefferson became a governing member of
his local [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_(United_States)"] Episcopal Church in Charlottesville, which he later
attended with his daughters.[329] Jefferson, however, spurned
metaphysical claims of Christianity.[330] Influenced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism"] Deist
authors during his college years, Jefferson abandoned
"orthodox" [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity"] Christianity after his review of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament"] New Testament
teachings.[331][332] Jefferson has sometimes been portrayed as a
follower of the liberal religious strand of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism"] Deism that values
reason over revelation.[333] Nonetheless, in 1803, Jefferson
asserted, "I am Christian, in the only sense in which [Jesus]
wished any one to be."[218] 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Bible"] Jefferson Bible featuring only the
words of Jesus from the evangelists, in
parallel Greek, Latin, French and English
Jefferson later defined being a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians"] Christian as one who followed
the simple teachings of Jesus. Influenced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Priestley"] Joseph Priestly,[333]
Jefferson selected [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament"] New Testament passages of Jesus' teachings into a
private work he called The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth,
known today as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Bible"] Jefferson Bible,  never published during his
lifetime.[334][335] Jefferson believed that Jesus' message had been
obscured and corrupted by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle"] Paul the Apostle, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Evangelists"] Gospel writers and
 Protestant reformers.[333] Peterson states that Jefferson was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theism"] theist
"whose God was the Creator of the universe ... all the evidences of
nature testified to His perfection; and man could rely on the harmony
and beneficence of His work."[336] In a letter to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams"] John Adams,
Jefferson wrote that what he believed was genuinely Christ's, found in
the Gospels, was "as easily distinguishable as diamonds in a
dunghill".[337] By omitting miracles and the resurrection, Jefferson
made the figure of Jesus more compatible with a worldview based on
reason.[338] 
Jefferson by Gilbert Stuart in
1805
Jefferson was firmly anticlerical, writing in "every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty ... they have
perverted the purest religion ever preached to man into mystery and jargon."[339] The full letter to Horatio
Spatford can be read at the National Archives.[340] Jefferson once supported banning clergy from public
office but later relented.[341] In 1777, he drafted the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Statute_for_Religious_Freedom"] Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Ratified in
1786, it made compelling attendance or contributions to any state-sanctioned religious establishment illegal
and declared that men "shall be free to profess ... their opinions in matters of religion."[342] The Statute is
one of only three accomplishments he chose to have inscribed in the epitaph on his gravestone.[343][344]
Early in 1802, Jefferson wrote to the Danbury Connecticut Baptist Association, "that religion is a matter
Page 28
which lies solely between Man and his God." He interpreted the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] First Amendment as having built "a wall
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state"] separation between Church and State."[345] The phrase 'Separation of Church and State' has been cited
several times by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States"] Supreme Court in its interpretation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause"] Establishment Clause.
Jefferson donated to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bible_Society"] American Bible Society, saying the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Evangelists"] Four Evangelists delivered a "pure and
sublime system of morality" to humanity. He thought Americans would rationally create "Apiarian"
religion, extracting the best traditions of every denomination.[346] And he contributed generously to several
local denominations near Monticello.[347] Acknowledging [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_religion"] organized religion would always be factored
into political life for good or ill, he encouraged reason over supernatural revelation to make inquiries into
religion. He believed in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creator_deity"] creator god, an afterlife, and the sum of religion as loving God and neighbors.
But he also controversially rejected fundamental Christian beliefs, denying the conventional Christian
Trinity, Jesus's divinity as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_God"] Son of God and miracles, the Resurrection of Christ, atonement from sin, and
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin"] original sin.[348][349][350] Jefferson believed that the original sin was a gross injustice and that God did not
condemn all of humanity by the transgression of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_and_Eve"] Adam and Eve in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden"] Garden of Eden.[351]
Jefferson's unorthodox religious beliefs became an important issue in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1800_United_States_presidential_election"] 1800 presidential election.[352]
Federalists attacked him as an atheist. As president, Jefferson countered the accusations by praising religion
in his inaugural address and attending services at the Capitol.[352]
Banks
Jefferson distrusted government banks and opposed public borrowing, which
he thought created long-term debt, bred monopolies, and invited dangerous
speculation as opposed to productive labor.[353] In one letter to Madison, he
argued each generation should curtail all debt within 19 years, and not impose
a long-term debt on subsequent generations.[354]
In 1791, President Washington asked Jefferson, then secretary of state, and
Hamilton, the secretary of the treasury, if the Congress had the authority to
create a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Bank_of_the_United_States"] national bank. While Hamilton believed Congress had the authority,
Jefferson and Madison thought a national bank would ignore the needs of
individuals and farmers, and would violate the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] Tenth Amendment by assuming
powers not granted to the federal government by the states.[355] Hamilton
successfully argued that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_powers"] implied powers given to the federal government in
the Constitution supported the creation of a national bank, among other federal
actions. 
Treasury Secretary
 Alexander Hamilton,
national bank proponent
and Jefferson's
adversary
Jefferson used agrarian resistance to banks and speculators as the first defining principle of an opposition
party, recruiting candidates for Congress on the issue as early as 1792.[356] As president, Jefferson was
persuaded by Secretary of Treasury Albert Gallatin to leave the bank intact but sought to restrain its
influence.[357][n]
Slavery
Jefferson lived in a planter economy largely dependent upon slavery, and as a wealthy landholder, used
slave labor for his household, plantation, and workshops. He first recorded his slaveholding in 1774, when
he counted 41 enslaved people.[359] Over his lifetime he owned about 600 slaves; he inherited about 175
people while most of the remainder were people born on his plantations.[360] Jefferson purchased some
slaves in order to reunite their families. He sold approximately 110 people for economic reasons, primarily
Page 29
slaves from his outlying farms.[360][361] In 1784 when the number
of slaves he owned likely was approximately 200, he began to
divest himself of many slaves and by 1794 he had divested himself
of 161 individuals.[362][o]
Jefferson once said, "My first wish is that the labourers may be well
treated".[360] Jefferson did not work his slaves on Sundays and
Christmas and he allowed them more personal time during the
winter months.[363] Some scholars doubt Jefferson's
benevolence,[364] however, noting cases of excessive slave
whippings in his absence. His nail factory was staffed only by
enslaved children. Many of the enslaved boys became tradesmen.
Burwell Colbert, who started his working life as a child in
Monticello's Nailery, was later promoted to the supervisory position
of butler.[365] 
Jefferson's 1795 Farm Book, page
Jefferson felt slavery was harmful to both slave and master but had 30, lists 163 slaves at Monticello.
reservations about releasing slaves from captivity, and advocated
for gradual emancipation.[366][367][368] In 1779, he proposed
gradual voluntary training and resettlement to the Virginia legislature, and three years later drafted
legislation allowing slaveholders to free their own slaves.[71] In his draft of the Declaration of
Independence, he included a section, stricken by other Southern delegates, criticizing King George III for
supposedly forcing slavery onto the colonies.[369] In 1784, Jefferson proposed the abolition of slavery in all
western U.S. territories, limiting slave importation to 15 years.[370] Congress, however, failed to pass his
proposal by one vote.[370] In 1787, Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance, a partial victory for
Jefferson that terminated slavery in the Northwest Territory. Jefferson freed his slave Robert Hemings in
 1794 and he freed his cook slave James Hemings in 1796.[371] Jefferson freed his runaway slave Harriet
Hemings in 1822.[372] Upon his death in 1826, Jefferson freed five male Hemings slaves in his will.[373]
During his presidency, Jefferson allowed the diffusion of slavery into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Territory"] Louisiana Territory hoping to
prevent slave uprisings in Virginia and to prevent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina"] South Carolina secession.[374] In 1804, in a compromise
on the slavery issue, Jefferson and Congress banned domestic slave trafficking for one year into the
Louisiana Territory.[375] In 1806 he officially called for anti-slavery legislation terminating the import or
export of slaves. Congress passed the law in 1807.[366][376][377]
In 1819, Jefferson strongly opposed a Missouri statehood application amendment that banned domestic
slave importation and freed slaves at the age of 25 on grounds it would destroy the union.[378] In Notes on
the State of Virginia, he created controversy by calling slavery a moral evil for which the nation would
ultimately have to account to God.[379] Jefferson wrote of his "suspicion" that Black people were mentally
and physically inferior to Whites, but argued that they nonetheless had innate human rights.[366][380][381]
He therefore supported colonization plans that would transport freed slaves to another country, such as
 Liberia or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone"] Sierra Leone, though he recognized the impracticability of such proposals.[382]
During his presidency, Jefferson was for the most part publicly silent on the issue of slavery and
emancipation,[383] as the Congressional debate over slavery and its extension caused a dangerous north–
south rift among the states, with talk of a northern confederacy in New England.[384][p] The violent attacks
on white slave owners during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution"] Haitian Revolution due to injustices under slavery supported Jefferson's
fears of a race war, increasing his reservations about promoting emancipation at that time.[366][385] After
numerous attempts and failures to bring about emancipation,[386] Jefferson wrote privately in an 1805 letter
Page 30
to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_A._Burwell"] William A. Burwell, "I have long since given up the expectation of any early provision for the
extinguishment of slavery among us." That same year he also related this idea to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Logan"] George Logan, writing, "I
have most carefully avoided every public act or manifestation on that subject."[387]
Historical assessment
Scholars remain divided on whether Jefferson truly condemned slavery and how he changed.[372][388]
Francis D. Cogliano traces the development of competing emancipationist then revisionist and finally
contextualist interpretations from the 1960s to the present. The emancipationist view, held by the various
scholars at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_Foundation"] Thomas Jefferson Foundation, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_L._Wilson"] Douglas L. Wilson, and others, maintains Jefferson was an
opponent of slavery all his life, noting that he did what he could within the limited range of options
available to him to undermine it, his many attempts at abolition legislation, the manner in which he
provided for slaves, and his advocacy of their more humane treatment.[389][390][391][q] The revisionist
view, advanced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Finkelman"] Paul Finkelman and others, criticizes him for holding slaves, and for acting contrary to
his words. Jefferson never freed most of his slaves, and he remained silent on the issue while he was
president.[383][392] Contextualists such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_J._Ellis"] Joseph J. Ellis emphasize a change in Jefferson's thinking from
his emancipationist views before 1783, noting Jefferson's shift toward public passivity and procrastination
on policy issues related to slavery. Jefferson seemed to yield to public opinion by 1794 as he laid the
groundwork for his first presidential campaign against Adams in 1796.[393]
Historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wiencek"] Henry Wiencek said Jefferson "rationalized an abomination to the point where an absolute moral
reversal was reached and he made slavery fit into America's national enterprise."[394]
On the contrary, historian and biographer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ferling"] John Ferling stated that Jefferson was "zealously committed to
slavery's abolition".[395]
Jefferson–Hemings controversy
Claims that Jefferson fathered Sally Hemings's children have been
debated since 1802. That year [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_T._Callender"] James T. Callender, after being
denied a position as postmaster, alleged Jefferson had taken
Hemings as a concubine and fathered several children with
her.[396] In 1998, a panel of researchers conducted a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-DNA"] Y-DNA study
of living descendants of Jefferson's uncle, Field, and of a
descendant of Hemings's son, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eston_Hemings"] Eston Hemings. The results, released
in November 1998, showed a match with the male Jefferson
line.[397][398] Subsequently, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation
(TJF) formed a nine-member research team of historians to assess
the matter.[398] In January 2000 (revised 2011),[398] the TJF report
concluded that "the DNA study ... indicates a high probability that
Thomas Jefferson fathered Eston Hemings."[398][399][r] The TJF
also concluded that Jefferson likely fathered all of Heming's
children listed at Monticello.[398][s] 
Jefferson depicted as a rooster, and
Hemings as a hen
In July 2017, the TJF announced that archeological excavations at Monticello had revealed what they
believe to have been Sally Hemings's quarters, adjacent to Jefferson's bedroom.[401][402] In 2018, the TJF
said that it considered the issue "a settled historical matter."[403] Since the results of the DNA tests were
made public, the consensus among most historians has been that Jefferson had a sexual relationship with
Sally Hemings and that he was the father of her son Eston Hemings.[404]
Page 31
Still, a minority of scholars maintain the evidence is insufficient to prove Jefferson's paternity conclusively.
Based on DNA and other evidence, they note the possibility that additional Jefferson males, including his
brother Randolph Jefferson and any one of Randolph's four sons, or his cousin, could have fathered Eston
Hemings or Sally Hemings's other children.[405] In 2002, historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_Peterson"] Merrill Peterson said: "in the absence of
direct documentary evidence either proving or refuting the allegation, nothing conclusive can be said about
Jefferson's relations with Sally Hemings."[406] Concerning the 1998 DNA study Peterson said: "the results
of the DNA testing of Jefferson and Hemings descendants provided support for the idea that Jefferson was
the father of at least one of Sally Hemings's children."[407]
After Thomas Jefferson's death, although not formally manumitted, Sally Hemings was allowed by
Jefferson's daughter Martha to live in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia"] Charlottesville as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_negro"] free woman with her two sons until her death in
1835.[408][t] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monticello_Association"] Monticello Association refused to allow Sally Hemings' descendants the right of burial at
Monticello.[410]
Interests and activities
Jefferson was a farmer, obsessed with new crops, soil conditions,
garden designs, and scientific agricultural techniques. His main
cash crop was tobacco, but its price was usually low and it was
rarely profitable. He tried to achieve self-sufficiency with wheat,
vegetables, flax, corn, hogs, sheep, poultry, and cattle to supply his
family, slaves, and employees, but he lived perpetually beyond his
means[411] and was always in debt.[412] 
Virginia State Capitol, designed by
Jefferson (wings added later)
In the field of architecture, Jefferson helped popularize the Neo-
Palladian style in the United States utilizing designs for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_State_Capitol"] Virginia State Capitol, the University of
Virginia, Monticello, and others.[413] Jefferson mastered architecture through [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism"] self-study, using various
 books and classical architectural designs of the day. His primary authority was Andrea Palladio's The Four
Books of Architecture, which outlines the principles of classical design.[414]
He was interested in birds and wine, and was a noted gourmet; he was also a prolific writer and linguist,
and spoke several languages.[415] As a naturalist, he was fascinated by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Bridge_(Virginia)"] Natural Bridge geological
formation, and in 1774 successfully acquired the Bridge by a grant from George III.[416]
American Philosophical Society
Jefferson was a member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Philosophical_Society"] American Philosophical Society for 35 years, beginning in 1780. Through
the society he advanced the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_in_the_Age_of_Enlightenment"] sciences and Enlightenment ideals, emphasizing that knowledge of science
reinforced and extended freedom.[417] His Notes on the State of Virginia was written in part as a
contribution to the society.[418] He became the society's third president on March 3, 1797, a few months
after he was elected Vice President of the United States.[418][419] In accepting, Jefferson stated: "I feel no
qualification for this distinguished post but a sincere zeal for all the objects of our institution and an ardent
desire to see knowledge so disseminated through the mass of mankind that it may at length reach even the
extremes of society, beggars and kings."[417]
Jefferson served as APS president for the next eighteen years, including through both terms of his
presidency.[418] He introduced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meriwether_Lewis"] Meriwether Lewis to the society, where various scientists tutored him in
preparation for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_and_Clark_Expedition"] Lewis and Clark Expedition.[418][420] He resigned on January 20, 1815, but remained
active through correspondence.[421]
Page 32
Linguistics
Jefferson had a lifelong interest in linguistics, and could speak, read, and write in a number of languages,
including French, Greek, Italian, and German. In his early years, he excelled in classical language while at
boarding school[422] where he received a classical education in Greek and Latin.[423] Jefferson later came
to regard the Greek language as the "perfect language" as expressed in its laws and philosophy.[424] While
attending the College of William & Mary, he taught himself Italian.[425] Here Jefferson first became familiar
with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon"] Anglo-Saxon language, especially as it was associated with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Law#Common_law"] English Common law and system of
government and studied the language in a linguistic and philosophical capacity. He owned 17 volumes of
Anglo-Saxon texts and grammar and later wrote an essay on the Anglo-Saxon language.[422]
Jefferson claimed to have taught himself Spanish during his nineteen-day journey to France, using only a
grammar guide and a copy of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Quixote"] Don Quixote.[426] Linguistics played a significant role in how Jefferson
modeled and expressed political and philosophical ideas. He believed that the study of ancient languages
was essential in understanding the roots of modern language.[427] He collected and understood a number of
 American Indian vocabularies and instructed Lewis and Clark to record and collect various Indian
languages during their Expedition.[428] When Jefferson moved from Washington after his presidency, he
packed 50 Native American vocabulary lists in a chest and transported them on a riverboat back to
Monticello along with the rest of his possessions. Somewhere along the journey, a thief stole the heavy
chest, thinking it was full of valuables, but its contents were dumped into the James River when the thief
discovered it was only filled with papers. Subsequently, 30 years of collecting were lost, with only a few
fragments rescued from the muddy banks of the river.[429]
Jefferson was not an outstanding orator and preferred to communicate through writing or remain silent if
possible. Instead of delivering his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union"] State of the Union addresses himself, Jefferson wrote the annual
messages and sent a representative to read them aloud in Congress. This started a tradition that continued
until 1913 when President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson"] Woodrow Wilson (1913–1921) chose to deliver his own State of the Union
address.[430]
Inventions
Jefferson invented many small practical devices and improved contemporary inventions, including a
revolving book-stand and a "Great Clock" powered by the gravitational pull on cannonballs. He improved
the pedometer, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygraph_(duplicating_device)"] polygraph (a device for duplicating writing),[431] and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moldboard_plow"] moldboard plow, an idea he
never patented and gave to posterity.[432] Jefferson can also be credited as the creator of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swivel_chair#Origin"] swivel chair,
the first of which he created and used to write much of the Declaration of Independence.[433]
As Minister to France, Jefferson was impressed by the military standardization program known as the
 Système Gribeauval, and initiated a program as president to develop [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interchangeable_parts"] interchangeable parts for firearms. For
his inventiveness and ingenuity, he received several honorary Doctor of Law degrees.[434]
Legacy
Historical reputation
Jefferson is an icon of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties"] individual liberty, democracy, and republicanism, hailed as the author of the
Declaration of Independence, an architect of the American Revolution, and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath#Renaissance_man"] renaissance man who
promoted science and scholarship.[435] The participatory democracy and expanded suffrage he championed
defined his era and became a standard for later generations.[436] Meacham opined that Jefferson was the
Page 33
most influential figure of the democratic republic in its first half-century, succeeded by presidential
adherents [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe"] James Monroe, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson"] Andrew Jackson, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Van_Buren"] Martin Van Buren.[437] Jefferson is
recognized for having written more than 18,000 letters of political and philosophical substance during his
life, which Francis D. Cogliano describes as "a documentary legacy ... unprecedented in American history
in its size and breadth."[438]
Jefferson's reputation declined during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"] American Civil War, due to his support of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States%27_rights"] states' rights. In the late
19th century, his legacy was widely criticized; conservatives felt that his democratic philosophy had led to
that era's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism"] populist movement, while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States"] Progressives sought a more activist federal government than Jefferson's
philosophy allowed. Both groups saw [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton as vindicated by history, rather than Jefferson,
and President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson"] Woodrow Wilson even described Jefferson as "though a great man, not a great
American".[439]
 In the 1930s, Jefferson was held in higher esteem; President Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933–1945) and New
Deal Democrats celebrated his struggles for "the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commoner"] common man" and reclaimed him as their party's founder.
Jefferson became a symbol of American democracy in the incipient [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War"] Cold War, and the 1940s and 1950s
saw the zenith of his popular reputation.[440] Following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement"] civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s,
Jefferson's slaveholding came under new scrutiny, particularly after DNA testing in the late 1990s
supported allegations that he had fathered multiple children with Sally Hemings.[441]

Noting the huge output of scholarly books on Jefferson in recent years, historian Gordon Wood summarizes
the raging debates about Jefferson's stature: "Although many historians and others are embarrassed about
his contradictions and have sought to knock him off the democratic pedestal ... his position, though shaky,
still seems secure."[442]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siena_Research_Institute"] Siena Research Institute poll of presidential scholars, begun in 1982, has consistently ranked Jefferson
 as one of the five best U.S. presidents,[443] and a 2015 Brookings Institution poll of American Political
Science Association members ranked him as the fifth greatest president.[444]
In 2020, historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Gordon-Reed"] Annette Gordon-Reed said that Jefferson's "vision of equality" did not include all people,
as it primarily excluded both blacks and women. Jefferson believed that Native peoples could be citizens,
as long as they agreed to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation"] assimilate into white society. According to her, Jefferson put little effort into
obtaining freedom for black slaves, as he did for white colonists from Britain. She also said that Jefferson
was doubtful of the intellectual capacity of blacks, compared to whites and also was hesitant to advocate or
examine the equality of women.[445] The assertion in the Declaration of Independence that it was "self-
evident" that "all men are created equal" inspired women, men, blacks, and whites to pursue equality.[445]
Others contend that Jefferson included women as well as men when he wrote that "all men are created
equal" and that he believed in women's natural equality as expressed in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notes_on_the_State_of_Virginia"] Notes on the State of Virginia.[446]

Memorials and honors
Jefferson has been memorialized with buildings,
sculptures, postage, and currency. In the 1920s,
Jefferson, together with George Washington,
 Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln, was
chosen by sculptor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutzon_Borglum"] Gutzon Borglum and approved by
President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Coolidge"] Calvin Coolidge to be depicted in stone at
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rushmore"] Mount Rushmore Memorial.[447]
 The Jefferson Memorial was dedicated in Washington,
D.C. in 1943, on the 200th anniversary of Jefferson's
birth. The interior of the memorial includes a 19-foot
(6 m) statue of Jefferson by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudulph_Evans"] Rudulph Evans and
engravings of passages from Jefferson's writings. Most
prominent are the words inscribed around the 
 Mount Rushmore National Memorial (left to right):
 George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore
Roosevelt, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln"] Abraham Lincoln
monument near the roof: "I have sworn upon the altar
of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man."[448]
In October 2021, in response to lobbying by activists, the New York City Public Design Commission voted
unanimously to remove a statue of the former president from the New York City Council chamber where it
had stood for more than a century.[449] The statue was taken down in November 2021.[450]

Notes
a. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Style_and_New_Style_dates"] Old Style: April 2, 1743
b. Jefferson personally showed little interest in his ancestry; on his father's side, he only knew
of the existence of his grandfather.[15][16] Malone writes that Jefferson vaguely knew that his
grandfather "had a place on the Fluvanna River which he called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowden_Plantation"] Snowden after a mountain
 in Wales near which the Jeffersons were supposed to have once lived".[15] See also Peter
Jefferson#Ancestry.
c. His other properties included Shadwell, Tufton, Lego, Pantops, and his retreat [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poplar_Forest"] Poplar Forest.
He also owned the unimproved mountaintop Montalto, and the Natural Bridge.[48]
d. While the news from Francis Eppes, with whom Lucy was staying, did not reach Jefferson
until 1785, in an undated letter,[58] it is clear that the year of her death was 1784 from another
letter to Jefferson from James Currie dated November 20, 1784.[59]
e. Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson on the question. Jefferson asked, "Why will
you not? You ought to do it." To which Adams responded, "I will not—reasons enough."
Jefferson replied, "What can be your reasons?" and Adams responded, "Reason first, you
are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason
second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason
third, you can write ten times better than I can." "Well," said Jefferson, "if you are decided, I
will do as well as I can." Adams concluded, "Very well. When you have drawn it up, we will
have a meeting."[69]
f. Franklin, seated beside the author, observed him "writhing a little under the acrimonious
criticisms on some of its parts."[75]
g. the immediate successor to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress"] Second Continental Congress
h. [URL: "https://www.loc.gov/item/mjm012583/"] An example can be seen at the Library of Congress website (https://www.loc.gov/item/mjm0

i. Jefferson's Kentucky draft said: "where powers are assumed which have not been
delegated, a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy: that every State has a natural right
in cases not within the compact, (casus non fœderis) to nullify of their own authority all
assumptions of power by others within their limits."[148]
j. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] This electoral process problem was addressed by the Twelfth Amendment to the United
States Constitution in 1804, which provided separate votes for presidential and vice-
presidential candidates.[158]
k. Louisiana nevertheless gained statehood nine years later in 1812.[198]
l. Further complicating matters, Wilkinson was posthumously revealed to have been in the
simultaneous pay of the British, French, and Spanish.[230]
m. Burr then left for Europe and eventually returned to practicing law.
n. The First Bank of the U.S. was eventually abolished in 1811 by a heavily Republican
Congress.[358]
o. The 135 slaves, which included Betty Hemings and her ten children, that Jefferson acquired
from Wayles's estate made him the second-largest slaveowner in Albemarle County with a
total of 187 slaves. The number fluctuated around 200 slaves until 1784 when he began to
give away or sell slaves. By 1794 he had gotten rid of 161 individuals.[362]

if he could persuade New York to go along, but the secession effort failed when Burr lost the
election.
q. For examples of each historian's view, see Wilson, Douglas L., Thomas Jefferson and the
Issue of Character, The Atlantic, November 1992. Finkelman, 1994 "Thomas Jefferson and
Antislavery: The Myth Goes On" and Joseph J. Ellis, 1996, American Sphinx: the character
of Thomas Jefferson
r. The minority report authored by White Wallenborn concluded "the historical evidence is not
substantial enough to confirm nor for that matter to refute his paternity of any of the children
of Sally Hemings. The DNA studies certainly enhance the possibility but ... do not prove
Thomas Jefferson's paternity".[400]
s. Sally Heming's children recorded at Monticello included: "Harriet (born 1795; died in
infancy); Beverly (born 1798); an unnamed daughter (born 1799; died in infancy); Harriet
(born 1801); Madison (born 1805); and Eston (born 1808)".[398]
t. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Gordon-Reed"] Annette Gordon-Reed notes that it would have been legally challenging to free Sally
Hemings, due to Virginia laws mandating the support of older slaves and requiring special
permission for freed slaves to remain within the state.[409]

Founding Fathers, Jefferson was considered a Deist, subscribing to the liberal religious
strand of Deism that values reason over revelation and rejects traditional Christian doctrines,
including the Virgin Birth, original sin and the resurrection of Jesus. While he rejected
orthodoxy, Jefferson was nevertheless a religious man. [...] Influenced by the British
Unitarian Joseph Priestley, Jefferson set his prodigious intellect and energy on the historical
figure at the center of the Christian faith: Jesus of Nazareth. Jefferson became convinced
that Jesus' message had been obscured and corrupted by the apostle Paul, the Gospel
writers and Protestant reformers."
