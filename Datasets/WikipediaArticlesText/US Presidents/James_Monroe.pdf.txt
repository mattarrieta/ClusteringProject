James Monroe ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /mənˈroʊ/ [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key"] mən-ROH; April 28, 1758 – July
4, 1831) was an American statesman, lawyer, diplomat and
 Founding Father who served as the 5th president of the United
 States from 1817 to 1825. A member of the Democratic-
Republican Party, Monroe was the last president of the
 Virginia dynasty and the Republican Generation; his
presidency coincided with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_Good_Feelings"] Era of Good Feelings,
concluding the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Party_System"] First Party System era of American politics. He
is perhaps best known for issuing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine"] Monroe Doctrine, a
policy of opposing European colonialism in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas"] Americas
while effectively asserting U.S. dominance, empire, and
hegemony in the hemisphere. He also served as governor of
Virginia, a member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate"] United States Senate, U.S.
ambassador to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"] France and Britain, the 7th [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State"] Secretary of State,
and the 8th [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_War"] Secretary of War. 
James Monroe
 Born into a slave-owning planter family in Westmoreland
County, Virginia, Monroe served in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army"] Continental Army
during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War"] American Revolutionary War. After studying law
under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"] Thomas Jefferson from 1780 to 1783, he served as a
 delegate in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Congress"] Continental Congress. As a delegate to the
 Virginia Ratifying Convention, Monroe opposed the
ratification of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution"] United States Constitution. In 1790, he won
election to the Senate, where he became a leader of the
Democratic-Republican Party. He left the Senate in 1794 to
serve as President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"] George Washington's ambassador to France
but was recalled by Washington in 1796. Monroe won the
election as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia"] Governor of Virginia in 1799 and strongly
 supported Jefferson's candidacy in the 1800 presidential
election.
As President Jefferson's  special envoy, Monroe helped
negotiate the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase"] Louisiana Purchase, through which the United
States nearly doubled in size. Monroe fell out with his longtime
 friend James Madison after Madison rejected the Monroe–
Pinkney Treaty that Monroe negotiated with Britain. He
unsuccessfully challenged Madison for the Democratic-
Republican nomination in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1808_United_States_presidential_election"] 1808 presidential election, but in
1811 he joined Madison's administration as Secretary of State.
During the later stages of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812"] War of 1812, Monroe
simultaneously served as Madison's Secretary of State and
Secretary of War. His wartime leadership established him as
Madison's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heir_apparent"] heir apparent, and he easily defeated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party"] Federalist
candidate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufus_King"] Rufus King in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1816_United_States_presidential_election"] 1816 presidential election.

 Monroe's presidency was concurrent with the Era of Good
Feelings. The Federalist Party collapsed as a national political
force during his tenure and Monroe was re-elected, virtually
 unopposed, in 1820. As president, Monroe signed the Missouri
Compromise, which admitted Missouri as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_state"] slave state and
banned slavery from territories north of the 36°30′ parallel. In
 foreign affairs, Monroe and Secretary of State John Quincy
Adams favored a policy of conciliation with Britain and a
policy of expansionism against the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Empire"] Spanish Empire. In the
1819 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs_Treaty"] Adams–Onís Treaty with Spain, the United States
 secured Florida and established its western border with New
Spain. In 1823, Monroe announced the United States'
 opposition to any European intervention in the recently
independent countries of the Americas with the Monroe
Doctrine, which became a landmark in American foreign
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Colonization_Society"] policy. Monroe was a member of the American Colonization
Society, which supported the colonization of Africa by freed
slaves, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia"] Liberia's capital of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monrovia"] Monrovia is named in his honor.
Following his retirement in 1825, Monroe was plagued by
 financial difficulties, and died on July 4, 1831, in New York
City — sharing a distinction with Presidents [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams"] John Adams and
 Thomas Jefferson of dying on the anniversary of U.S
independence. He has been [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States"] generally ranked as an above-
average president by historians.

Early life
James Monroe was born April 28, 1758, in his parents' house in a wooded area of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westmoreland_County,_Virginia"] Westmoreland County,
 Virginia. The marked site is one mile from the unincorporated community known today as Monroe Hall,
Virginia. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe_Family_Home_Site"] James Monroe Family Home Site was listed on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places"] National Register of Historic Places in
1979. His father Spence Monroe (1727–1774) was a moderately prosperous planter and slave owner who
also practiced carpentry. His mother Elizabeth Jones (1730–1772) married Spence Monroe in 1752 and
they had five children: Elizabeth, James, Spence, Andrew, and Joseph Jones.[1][2]
His paternal great-great-grandfather Patrick Andrew Monroe emigrated to America from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland"] Scotland in the
mid-17th century, and was part of an ancient Scottish clan known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Munro"] Clan Munro. In 1650 he patented a
large tract of land in Washington Parish, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westmoreland_County,_Virginia"] Westmoreland County, Virginia. Monroe's mother was the
daughter of James Jones, who immigrated from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales"] Wales and settled in nearby [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_George_County,_Virginia"] King George County, Virginia.
Jones was a wealthy architect.[1] Also among James Monroe's ancestors were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Huguenot"] French Huguenot
immigrants, who came to Virginia in 1700.[2]
At age 11, Monroe was enrolled in Campbelltown Academy, the lone school in the county. He attended
this school only 11 weeks a year, as his labor was needed on the farm. During this time, Monroe formed a
lifelong friendship with an older classmate, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall"] John Marshall. Monroe's mother died in 1772, and his father
Page 4
two years later. Though he inherited property, including slaves,
from both of his parents, the 16-year-old Monroe was forced to
withdraw from school to support his younger brothers. His
childless maternal uncle, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Jones_(Virginia)"] Joseph Jones, became a surrogate father to
 Monroe and his siblings. A member of the Virginia House of
 Burgesses, Jones took Monroe to the capital of Williamsburg,
Virginia, and enrolled him in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_William_and_Mary"] College of William and Mary.
Jones also introduced Monroe to important Virginians such as
Marker designating the site of James
 Monroe's birthplace in Monroe Hall,
Virginia 
 Thomas Jefferson, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Henry"] Patrick Henry, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"] George Washington. In
 1774, opposition to the British government grew in the Thirteen
Colonies in reaction to the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intolerable_Acts"] Intolerable Acts", and Virginia sent a
delegation to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Continental_Congress"] First Continental Congress. Monroe became
involved in the opposition to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Murray,_4th_Earl_of_Dunmore"] Lord Dunmore, the colonial governor
of Virginia, and took part in the storming of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor%27s_Palace_(Williamsburg,_Virginia)"] Governor's Palace.[3]
Revolutionary War service
In early 1776, about a year and a half after his enrollment, Monroe dropped out of college and joined the
3rd Virginia Regiment in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army"] Continental Army.[4] As the fledgling army valued literacy in its officers,
Monroe was commissioned with the rank of lieutenant, serving under Captain [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Washington"] William Washington. After
 months of training, Monroe and 700 Virginia infantrymen were called north to serve in the New York and
New Jersey campaign. Shortly after the Virginians arrived, George Washington led the army in a retreat
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City"] New York City into New Jersey and then across the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_River"] Delaware River into Pennsylvania. In late
December, Monroe took part in a surprise attack on a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessian_(soldier)"] Hessian encampment at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Trenton"] Battle of Trenton.
Though the attack was successful, Monroe suffered a severed artery in the battle and nearly died. In the
aftermath, Washington cited Monroe and William Washington for their bravery, and promoted Monroe to
captain. After his wounds healed, Monroe returned to Virginia to recruit his own company of soldiers.[5]
 His participation in the battle was memorialized in John Trumbull's painting The Capture of the Hessians at
Trenton, December 26, 1776 as well as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Leutze"] Emanuel Leutze's 1851 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Crossing_the_Delaware_(1851_painting)"] Washington Crossing the Delaware.[6]
Lacking the wealth to induce soldiers to join his
company, Monroe instead asked his uncle to return
him to the front. Monroe was assigned to the staff of
General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Alexander,_Lord_Stirling"] William Alexander, Lord Stirling. During this
 time he formed a close friendship with the Marquis de
Lafayette, a French volunteer who encouraged him to
view the war as part of a wider struggle against
religious and political tyranny. Monroe served in the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_campaign"] Philadelphia campaign and spent the winter of 1777–
78 at the encampment of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_Forge"] Valley Forge, sharing a log
 hut with Marshall. After serving in the Battle of
Monmouth, the destitute Monroe resigned his
commission in December 1778 and joined his uncle in
Philadelphia. After the British [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_of_Savannah"] captured Savannah, the
Virginia legislature decided to raise four regiments,
and Monroe returned to his native state, hoping to
receive his own command. With letters of
recommendation from Washington, Stirling, and
 Alexander Hamilton, Monroe received a commission
as a lieutenant colonel and was expected to lead one of

the regiments, but recruitment again proved to be a problem. On Jones's advice, Monroe returned to
Williamsburg to study law, becoming a protege of Virginia Governor Thomas Jefferson.[7]
With the British increasingly focusing their operations in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"] Southern colonies, the Virginians moved the
capital to the more defensible city of Richmond, and Monroe accompanied Jefferson to the new capital. As
governor of Virginia, Jefferson held command over its militia, and made Monroe a colonel. Monroe
established a messenger network to coordinate with the Continental Army and other state militias. Still
unable to raise an army due to a lack of interested recruits, Monroe traveled to his home in King George
County, and thus was not present for the British [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_of_Richmond"] raid of Richmond. As both the Continental Army and the
Virginia militia had an abundance of officers, Monroe did not serve during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorktown_campaign"] Yorktown campaign, and,
much to his frustration, did not take part in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown"] Siege of Yorktown.[8] Although [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson"] Andrew Jackson served as
 a courier in a militia unit at age 13, Monroe is regarded as the last U.S. president who was a Revolutionary
War veteran, since he served as an officer of the Continental Army and took part in combat.[9] As a result
of his service, Monroe became a member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_the_Cincinnati"] Society of the Cincinnati.[10][11]
Monroe resumed studying law under Jefferson and continued until 1783.[12][13] He was not particularly
interested in legal theory or practice, but chose to take it up because he thought it offered "the most
immediate rewards" and could ease his path to wealth, social standing, and political influence.[13] Monroe
was admitted to the Virginia bar and practiced in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredericksburg,_Virginia"] Fredericksburg, Virginia.
Marriage and family
On February 16, 1786, Monroe married [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Monroe"] Elizabeth Kortright (1768–
1830) in New York City.[14] She was the daughter of Hannah
Aspinwall Kortright and Laurence Kortright, a wealthy trader and
former British officer. Monroe met her while serving in the
Continental Congress.[15]
After a brief honeymoon on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island,_New_York"] Long Island, New York, the Monroes
returned to New York City to live with her father until Congress
 adjourned. They then moved to Virginia, settling in Charlottesville,
Virginia, in 1789. They bought an estate in Charlottesville known
as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Lawn%E2%80%93Highland"] Ash Lawn–Highland, settling on the property in 1799. The
Monroes had three children.[16]
 Eliza Monroe Hay was born in Fredericksburg, Virginia,
in 1786, and was educated in Paris at the school of
 Madame Campan during the time her father was the  Elizabeth Kortright
United States Ambassador to France. In 1808 she
married [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hay_(Virginia_judge)"] George Hay, a prominent Virginia attorney who
had served as prosecutor in the trial of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr"] Aaron Burr and later as a U.S. District Judge. She
died in 1840.[17]
James Spence Monroe was born in 1799 and died sixteen months later in 1800.[18]
 Maria Hester Monroe (1802–1850) married her cousin [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Gouverneur"] Samuel L. Gouverneur on March 8,
1820, in the White House, the first president's child to marry there.[19][20]
Plantations and slavery
Page 6
Monroe sold his small Virginia plantation in 1783 to enter law and
politics. Although he owned multiple properties over the course of
his lifetime, his plantations were never profitable. Although he
owned much more land and many more slaves, and speculated in
property, he was rarely on site to oversee the operations. Overseers
treated the slaves harshly to force production, but the plantations
barely broke even. Monroe incurred debts by his lavish and
expensive lifestyle and often sold property (including slaves) to pay
them off.[21] The labor of Monroe's many slaves were also used to
support his daughter and son-in-law, along with a ne'er-do-well
brother and his son. 
Oak Hill Mansion
During the course of his presidency, Monroe remained convinced that slavery was wrong and supported
private manumission, but at the same time he insisted that any attempt to promote emancipation would
cause more problems. Monroe believed that slavery had become a permanent part of southern life, and that
it could only be removed on providential terms. Like so many other Upper South slaveholders, Monroe
believed that a central purpose of government was to ensure "domestic tranquility" for all. Like so many
other Upper South planters, he also believed that the central purpose of government was to empower
planters like himself. He feared for public safety in the United States during the era of violent revolution on
two fronts. First, from potential class warfare of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution"] French Revolution in which those of the propertied
classes were summarily purged in mob violence and then preemptive trials, and second, from possible racial
warfare similar to that of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution"] Haitian Revolution in which blacks, whites, then mixed-race inhabitants were
indiscriminately slaughtered as events there unfolded.
Early political career
Virginia politics
Monroe was elected to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_House_of_Delegates"] Virginia House of Delegates in 1782. After serving on Virginia's Executive
Council,[22] he was elected to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_the_Confederation"] Congress of the Confederation in November 1783 and served in
Annapolis until Congress convened in Trenton, New Jersey in June 1784. He had served a total of three
years when he finally retired from that office by the rule of rotation.[23] By that time, the government was
meeting in the temporary capital of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City"] New York City. In 1784, Monroe undertook an extensive trip through
Western New York and Pennsylvania to inspect the conditions in the Northwest. The tour convinced him
that the United States had to pressure Britain to abandon its posts in the region and assert control of the
Northwest.[24] While serving in Congress, Monroe became an advocate for western expansion, and played
 a key role in the writing and passage of the Northwest Ordinance. The ordinance created the Northwest
 Territory, providing for federal administration of the territories West of Pennsylvania and North of the Ohio
River. During this period, Jefferson continued to serve as a mentor to Monroe, and, at Jefferson's
prompting, he befriended another prominent Virginian, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison"] James Madison.[25]
Monroe resigned from Congress in 1786 to focus on his legal career, and he became an attorney for the
state. In 1787, Monroe won election to another term in the Virginia House of Delegates. Though he had
become outspoken in his desire to reform the Articles, he was unable to attend the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States)"] Philadelphia Convention
 due to his work obligations.[26] In 1788, Monroe became a delegate to the Virginia Ratifying
Convention.[27] In Virginia, the struggle over the ratification of the proposed Constitution involved more
than a simple clash between federalists and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-federalists"] anti-federalists. Virginians held a full spectrum of opinions
about the merits of the proposed change in national government. Washington and Madison were leading
supporters; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Henry"] Patrick Henry and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Mason"] George Mason were leading opponents. Those who held the middle ground
in the ideological struggle became the central figures. Led by Monroe and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Pendleton"] Edmund Pendleton, these
Page 7
"federalists who are for amendments" criticized the absence of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_rights"] bill of rights and worried about
surrendering taxation powers to the central government.[28] After Madison reversed himself and promised
to pass a bill of rights, the Virginia convention ratified the constitution by a narrow vote, though Monroe
himself voted against it. Virginia was the tenth state to ratify the Constitution, and all thirteen states
eventually ratified the document.[29]
Senator
Henry and other anti-federalists hoped to elect a Congress that would amend the Constitution to take away
most of the powers it had been granted ("commit suicide on [its] own authority", as Madison put it). Henry
recruited Monroe to run against Madison for a House seat in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_United_States_Congress"] First Congress, and he had the Virginia
legislature [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering_in_the_United_States"] draw a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_district"] congressional district designed to elect Monroe. During the campaign, Madison and
 Monroe often traveled together, and the election did not destroy their friendship. In the election for
Virginia's Fifth District, Madison prevailed over Monroe, taking 1,308 votes compared to Monroe's 972
votes. Following his defeat, Monroe returned to his legal duties and developed his farm in Charlottesville.
After the death of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate"] Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Grayson"] William Grayson in 1790, Virginia legislators elected Monroe to serve the
remainder of Grayson's term.[30]
During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_Washington"] presidency of George Washington, U.S. politics became increasingly polarized between the
supporters of Secretary of State Jefferson and the Federalists, led by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander
Hamilton. Monroe stood firmly with Jefferson in opposing Hamilton's strong central government and
strong executive. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party"] Democratic-Republican Party coalesced around Jefferson and Madison, and Monroe
 became one of the fledgling party's leaders in the Senate. He also helped organize opposition to John
Adams in the 1792 election, though Adams defeated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clinton_(vice_president)"] George Clinton to win re-election as vice
president.[31] As the 1790s progressed, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Wars"] French Revolutionary Wars came to dominate U.S. foreign
policy, with British and French raids both threatening U.S. trade with Europe. Like most other
Jeffersonians, Monroe supported the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution"] French Revolution, but Hamilton's followers tended to sympathize
more with Britain. In 1794, hoping to find a way to avoid war with both countries, Washington appointed
Monroe as his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_France"] minister (ambassador) to France. At the same time, he appointed the anglophile Federalist
 John Jay as his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_the_United_Kingdom"] minister to Britain.[32]
Minister to France
After arriving in France, Monroe addressed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Convention"] National Convention,
receiving a standing ovation for his speech celebrating republicanism. He
experienced several early diplomatic successes, including the protection of
U.S. trade from French attacks. He also used his influence to win the
release of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine"] Thomas Paine and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrienne_de_La_Fayette"] Adrienne de La Fayette, the wife of the
Marquis de Lafayette.[33] Months after Monroe arrived in France, the U.S.
and Great Britain concluded the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Treaty"] Jay Treaty, outraging both the French and
Monroe—not fully informed about the treaty prior to its publication.
Despite the undesirable effects of the Jay Treaty on Franco-American
relations, Monroe won French support for U.S. navigational rights on the
 Mississippi River—the mouth of which was controlled by Spain—and in
1795 the U.S. and Spain signed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinckney%27s_Treaty"] Pinckney's Treaty. The treaty granted the
U.S. limited rights to use the port of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans"] New Orleans.[34]

Washington decided Monroe was inefficient, disruptive, and failed to
safeguard the national interest. He recalled Monroe in November 1796.[35]
Returning to his home in Charlottesville, he resumed his dual careers as a farmer and lawyer.[36] Jefferson
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism"]

and Madison urged Monroe to run for Congress, but Monroe chose to focus on state politics instead.[37]
In 1798 Monroe published A View of the Conduct of the Executive, in the Foreign Affairs of the United
States: Connected with the Mission to the French Republic, During the Years 1794, 5, and 6 . It was a long
defense of his term as Minister to France. He followed the advice of his friend Robert Livingston who
cautioned him to "repress every harsh and acrimonious" comment about Washington. However, he did
complain that too often the U.S. government had been too close to Britain, especially regarding the Jay
Treaty.[38] Washington made notes on this copy, writing, "The truth is, Mr. Monroe was cajoled, flattered,
and made to believe strange things. In return he did, or was disposed to do, whatever was pleasing to that
nation, reluctantly urging the rights of his own."[39]
Confrontations and strife with Alexander Hamilton
In November 1792, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Reynolds_affair"] James Reynolds and Jacob Clingman were arrested for counterfeiting and speculating
 in Revolutionary War veterans' unpaid back wages. Then-Senator Monroe and congressmen Frederick
Muhlenberg and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_B._Venable"] Abraham Venable investigated the charges. They found that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton"] Alexander Hamilton had
been making payments to James Reynolds, and suspected Hamilton was involved in the crimes.[40] They
asked him about it, and Hamilton denied involvement in the financial crimes, but admitted that he'd made
payments to Reynolds, and explained he'd had an affair with Reynolds' wife, Maria. James Reynolds had
found out and was blackmailing him. He offered letters to prove his story. The investigators immediately
dropped the matter, and Monroe promised Hamilton he would keep the matter private.
Jacob Clingman told Maria about the claim she'd had an affair with Hamilton, and she denied it, claiming
the letters had been forged to help cover up the corruption. Clingman went to Monroe about this. Monroe
added that interview to his notes, and sent the entire set to a friend, possibly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"] Thomas Jefferson, for
safekeeping. Unfortunately, the secretary who was involved in managing the notes of the investigation
made copies and gave them to scandal writer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Callender"] James Callender.[41]
Five years later, shortly after Monroe was recalled from France, Callender published accusations against
Hamilton based on those notes. Hamilton and his wife thought this was retaliation on the part of Monroe
for the recall, and confronted him via letter. In a subsequent meeting between the two of them, where
Hamilton had suggested each bring a "second", Hamilton accused Monroe of lying, and challenged him to
a duel. While such challenges were usually hot air, in this case Monroe replied "I am ready, get your
pistols." Their seconds interceded, and an arrangement was made to give Hamilton documentation on what
had occurred with the investigation.
Hamilton was not satisfied with the subsequent explanations, and at the end of an exchange of letters the
two were threatening duels, again. Monroe chose [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr"] Aaron Burr as his second. Burr worked as a negotiator
between the two parties, believing they were both being "childish", and eventually helped settle matters.[42]
Governor of Virginia and diplomat (1799–1802, 1811)
Governor of Virginia
On a party-line vote, the Virginia legislature elected Monroe as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Virginia"] Governor of Virginia in 1799. He would
serve as governor until 1802.[43] The constitution of Virginia endowed the governor with very few powers
aside from commanding the militia when the Assembly called it into action. But Monroe used his stature to
convince legislators to enhance state involvement in transportation and education and to increase training
for the militia. Monroe also began to give [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_State_address"] State of the Commonwealth addresses to the legislature, in which
he highlighted areas in which he believed the legislature should act. Monroe also led an effort to create the
Page 9
state's first penitentiary, and imprisonment replaced other, often harsher, punishments. In 1800, Monroe
called out the state militia to suppress [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel%27s_Rebellion"] Gabriel's Rebellion, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_rebellion"] slave rebellion originating on a plantation six
miles from the capital of Richmond. Gabriel and 27 other enslaved people who participated were all
hanged for treason.[44] As Governor, Monroe secretly worked with President Thomas Jefferson to secure a
location where free and enslaved African Americans suspected of "conspiracy, insurgency, Treason, and
rebellion" would be permanently banished.
Monroe thought that foreign and Federalist elements had created the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi_War"] Quasi War of 1798–1800, and he
strongly supported [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"] Thomas Jefferson's candidacy for president in 1800. Federalists were likewise
suspicious of Monroe, some viewing him at best as a French dupe and at worst a traitor.[45] With the power
to appoint election officials in Virginia, Monroe exercised his influence to help Jefferson win Virginia's
 presidential electors.[46] He also considered using the Virginia militia to force the outcome in favor of
Jefferson.[47] Jefferson won the 1800 election, and he appointed Madison as his Secretary of State. As a
member of Jefferson's party and the leader of the largest state in the country, Monroe emerged as one of
Jefferson's two most likely successors, alongside Madison.[48]
Louisiana Purchase and Minister to Great Britain
Shortly after the end of Monroe's gubernatorial tenure, President Jefferson sent Monroe back to France to
 assist Ambassador Robert R. Livingston in negotiating the Louisiana Purchase. In the 1800 Treaty of San
Ildefonso, France had acquired the territory of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_(New_Spain)"] Louisiana from Spain; at the time, many in the U.S. believed
that France had also acquired [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Florida"] West Florida in the same treaty. The American delegation originally sought to
acquire West Florida and the city of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans"] New Orleans, which controlled the trade of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River"] Mississippi River.
Determined to acquire New Orleans even if it meant war with France, Jefferson also authorized Monroe to
form an alliance with the British if the French refused to sell the city.[49]
Meeting with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Barb%C3%A9-Marbois"] François Barbé-Marbois, the French foreign minister, Monroe and Livingston agreed to
 purchase the entire territory of Louisiana for $15 million; the purchase became known as the Louisiana
Purchase. In agreeing to the purchase, Monroe violated his instructions, which had only allowed $9 million
for the purchase of New Orleans and West Florida. The French did not acknowledge that West Florida
remained in Spanish possession, and the United States would claim that France had sold West Florida to the
United States for several years to come. Though he had not ordered the purchase of the entire territory,
Jefferson strongly supported Monroe's actions, which ensured that the United States would continue to
expand to the West. Overcoming doubts about whether the Constitution authorized the purchase of foreign
territory, Jefferson won congressional approval for the Louisiana Purchase, and the acquisition doubled the
size of the United States. Monroe would travel to Spain in 1805 to try to win the cession of West Florida,
but, with the support of France, Spain refused to consider relinquishing the territory.[50]
After the resignation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rufus_King"] Rufus King, Monroe was appointed as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Ambassador_to_Great_Britain"] ambassador to Great Britain in 1803.
The greatest issue of contention between the United States and Britain was that of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressment"] impressment of U.S.
sailors. Many U.S. merchant ships employed British seamen who had deserted or dodged conscription, and
the British frequently impressed sailors on U.S. ships in hopes of quelling their manpower issues. Many of
the sailors they impressed had never been British subjects, and Monroe was tasked with persuading the
British to stop their practice of impressment. Monroe found little success in this endeavor, partly due to
Jefferson's alienation of the British minister to the United States, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Merry"] Anthony Merry. Rejecting Jefferson's offer
to serve as the first governor of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Territory"] Louisiana Territory, Monroe continued to serve as ambassador to Britain
until 1807.[51]
In 1806 he negotiated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe%E2%80%93Pinkney_Treaty"] Monroe–Pinkney Treaty with Great Britain. It would have extended the Jay
Treaty of 1794 which had expired after ten years. Jefferson had fought the Jay Treaty intensely in 1794–95
because he felt it would allow the British to subvert [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States"] American republicanism. The treaty had produced ten
Page 10
years of peace and highly lucrative trade for American merchants, but Jefferson was still opposed. When
Monroe and the British signed the new treaty in December 1806, Jefferson refused to submit it to the
Senate for ratification. Although the treaty called for ten more years of trade between the United States and
the British Empire and gave American merchants guarantees that would have been good for business,
Jefferson was unhappy that it did not end the hated British practice of impressment, and refused to give up
the potential weapon of commercial warfare against Britain. The president made no attempt to obtain
another treaty, and as a result, the two nations drifted from peace toward the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812"] War of 1812.[52] Monroe was
severely pained by the administration's repudiation of the treaty, and he fell out with Secretary of State
James Madison.[53]
1808 election and the Quids
On his return to Virginia in 1807, Monroe received a warm reception, and many urged him to run in the
 1808 presidential election.[54] After Jefferson refused to submit the Monroe-Pinkney Treaty, Monroe had
come to believe that Jefferson had snubbed the treaty out of the desire to avoid elevating Monroe above
Madison in 1808.[55] Out of deference to Jefferson, Monroe agreed to avoid actively campaigning for the
presidency, but he did not rule out accepting a draft effort.[56] The Democratic-Republican Party was
increasingly factionalized, with "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Republicans"] Old Republicans" or "Quids" denouncing the Jefferson administration for
abandoning what they considered to be true republican principles. The Quids tried to enlist Monroe in their
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party"] cause. The plan was to run Monroe for president in the 1808 election in cooperation with the Federalist
Party, which had a strong base in New England. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Randolph_of_Roanoke"] John Randolph of Roanoke led the Quid effort to stop
Jefferson's choice of Madison. The regular Democratic-Republicans overcame the Quids in the nominating
caucus, kept control of the party in Virginia, and protected Madison's base.[57] Monroe did not publicly
criticize Jefferson or Madison during Madison's campaign against Federalist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cotesworth_Pinckney"] Charles Cotesworth Pinckney,
but he refused to support Madison.[58] Madison defeated Pinckney by a large margin, carrying all but one
state outside of New England. Monroe won 3,400 votes in Virginia, but received little support
elsewhere.[56] After the election Monroe quickly reconciled with Jefferson, but their friendship endured
further strains when Jefferson did not promote Monroe's candidacy to Congress in 1809.[59] Monroe did
not speak with Madison until 1810.[53] Returning to private life, he devoted his attentions to farming at his
Charlottesville estate.[60]
Secretary of State and Secretary of War (1811–1817)
Madison administration
Monroe returned to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was elected to another term as governor in 1811,
but served only four months. In April 1811, Madison appointed Monroe as Secretary of State in hopes of
shoring up the support of the more radical factions of the Democratic-Republicans.[53] Madison also hoped
that Monroe, an experienced diplomat with whom he had once been close friends, would improve upon the
performance of the previous Secretary of State, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Smith_(Cabinet_member)"] Robert Smith. Madison assured Monroe that their
differences regarding the Monroe-Pinkney Treaty had been a misunderstanding, and the two resumed their
friendship.[61] The Senate voted unanimously (30-0) to confirm him. On taking office, Monroe hoped to
negotiate treaties with the British and French to end the attacks on American merchant ships. While the
French agreed to reduce the attacks and release seized American ships, the British were less receptive to
Monroe's demands.[62] Monroe had long worked for peace with the British, but he came to favor war with
Britain, joining with "war hawks" such as Speaker of the House [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay"] Henry Clay. With the support of Monroe
and Clay, Madison asked Congress to declare war upon the British, and Congress complied on June 18,
1812, thus beginning the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812"] War of 1812.[63]
Page 11
 Portrait of Secretary Monroe by John
Vanderlyn, c. 1816 
The war went very badly, and the Madison administration quickly
sought peace, but were rejected by the British.[64] The U.S. Navy
did experience several successes after Monroe convinced Madison
to allow the Navy's ships to set sail rather than remaining in port for
the duration of the war.[65] After the resignation of Secretary of
War [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Eustis"] William Eustis, Madison asked Monroe to serve in dual roles
as Secretary of State and Secretary of War, but opposition from the
Senate limited Monroe to serving as acting Secretary of War until
Brigadier General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Armstrong_Jr."] John Armstrong won Senate confirmation.[66]
Monroe and Armstrong clashed over war policy, and Armstrong
blocked Monroe's hopes of being appointed to lead an invasion of
Canada.[67] As the war dragged on, the British offered to begin
negotiations in Ghent, and the United States sent a delegation led
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams"] John Quincy Adams to conduct negotiations. Monroe allowed
Adams leeway in setting terms, so long as he ended the hostilities
and preserved American neutrality.[68]
When the British burned the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol"] U.S. Capitol and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"] White House on
August 24, 1814, Madison removed Armstrong as Secretary of War and turned to Monroe for help,
appointing him Secretary of War on September 27.[69] Monroe resigned as Secretary of State on October 1,
1814, but no successor was ever appointed and thus from October 1814 to February 28, 1815, Monroe
effectively held both Cabinet posts.[70] Now in command of the war effort, Monroe ordered General
 Andrew Jackson to defend against a likely attack on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans"] New Orleans by the British, and he asked the
governors of nearby states to send their militias to reinforce Jackson. He also called on Congress to draft an
army of 100,000 men, increase compensation to soldiers, and establish a new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_bank"] national bank to ensure
adequate funding for the war effort.[71] Months after Monroe took office as Secretary of War, the war
ended with the signing of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Ghent"] Treaty of Ghent. The treaty resulted in a return to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_ante_bellum"] status quo ante bellum,
and many outstanding issues between the United States and Britain remained. But Americans celebrated
the end of the war as a great victory, partly due to the news of the treaty reaching the United States shortly
after Jackson's victory in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_New_Orleans"] Battle of New Orleans. With the end of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars"] Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the
British also ended the practice of impressment. After the war, Congress authorized the creation of a national
bank in the form of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States"] Second Bank of the United States.[72]
Election of 1816
Monroe decided to seek the presidency in the 1816 election, and his war-time leadership had established
him as Madison's heir apparent. Monroe had strong support from many in the party, but his candidacy was
challenged at the 1816 Democratic-Republican [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_nominating_caucus"] congressional nominating caucus. Secretary of the Treasury
 William H. Crawford had the support of numerous Southern and Western Congressmen, while Governor
 Daniel D. Tompkins was backed by several Congressmen from New York. Crawford appealed especially
to many Democratic-Republicans who were wary of Madison and Monroe's support for the establishment
of the Second Bank of the United States.[73] Despite his substantial backing, Crawford decided to defer to
Monroe on the belief that he could eventually run as Monroe's successor, and Monroe won his party's
nomination. Tompkins won the party's vice presidential nomination. The moribund Federalists nominated
Rufus King as their presidential nominee, but the party offered little opposition following the conclusion of
a popular war that they had opposed. Monroe received 183 of the 217 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)"] electoral votes, winning every state
but Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Delaware.[74] Since he previously served as an officer of the
 Continental Army during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War"] Revolutionary War and as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_delegates_to_the_Continental_Congress"] delegate in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Congress"] Continental Congress, he became
the last president who was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States"] Founding Father.

Presidency (1817–1825)
Domestic affairs
Democratic-Republican Party dominance
Monroe largely ignored old party lines in making federal appointments, which reduced political tensions
and augmented the sense of "oneness" that pervaded the United States. He made two long national tours to
 build national trust. At Boston, a newspaper hailed his 1817 visit as the beginning of an "Era of Good
Feelings". Frequent stops on his tours included ceremonies of welcome and expressions of good-will. The
Federalist Party continued to fade during his administration; it maintained its vitality and organizational
integrity in Delaware and a few localities, but lacked influence in national politics. Lacking serious
opposition, the Democratic-Republican Party's Congressional caucus stopped meeting, and for practical
purposes the party stopped operating.[75]
Administration and cabinet
Monroe appointed a geographically balanced cabinet, through
which he led the executive branch.[76] At Monroe's request,
Crawford continued to serve as Treasury Secretary. Monroe also
chose to retain [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Williams_Crowninshield"] Benjamin Crowninshield of Massachusetts as
Secretary of the Navy and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rush"] Richard Rush of Pennsylvania as
Attorney General. Recognizing Northern discontent at the
continuation of the Virginia dynasty, Monroe chose John Quincy
Adams of Massachusetts as Secretary of State, making Adams the
early favorite to eventually succeed Monroe. An experienced
diplomat, Adams had abandoned the Federalist Party in 1807 in
support of Thomas Jefferson's foreign policy, and Monroe hoped
that the appointment would encourage the defection of more
Federalists. After General Andrew Jackson declined appointment
as Secretary of War, Monroe turned to South Carolina
Congressman [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Calhoun"] John C. Calhoun, leaving the Cabinet without a
prominent Westerner. In late 1817 Rush became the ambassador to
Britain, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wirt_(Attorney_General)"] William Wirt succeeded him as Attorney General.[77]
With the exception of Crowninshield, the rest of Monroe's initial
cabinet appointees remained in place for the remainder of his
presidency.[78]
Missouri Compromise
 In February 1819, a bill to enable the people of the Missouri
Territory to draft a constitution and form a government preliminary
 to admission into the Union came before the House of
 Representatives. During these proceedings, Congressman James
Tallmadge, Jr. of New York "tossed a bombshell into the Era of
Good Feelings"[79] by offering the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallmadge_Amendment"] Tallmadge Amendment, which
prohibited the further introduction of slaves into Missouri and
required that all future children of slave parents therein should be

free at the age of twenty-five years. After three days of rancorous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Southard"] Southard
and sometimes bitter debate, the bill, with Tallmadge's
amendments, passed. The measure then went to the Senate, which rejected both amendments.[80] A
House–Senate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_committee"] conference committee proved unable to resolve the disagreements on the bill, and so the
entire measure failed.[81] The ensuing debates pitted the northern "restrictionists" (antislavery legislators
who wished to bar slavery from the Louisiana territories and prohibit slavery's further expansion) against
southern "anti-restrictionists" (proslavery legislators who rejected any interference by Congress inhibiting
slavery expansion).[82]
During the following session, the House passed a similar bill with an amendment, introduced on January
26, 1820, by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Taylor_(politician)"] John W. Taylor of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)"] New York, allowing Missouri into the union as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_state"] slave state. Initially,
Monroe opposed any compromise that involved restrictions on slavery's expansion in federal territories.
The question had been complicated by the admission in December of Alabama, a slave state, making the
number of slave and free states equal. In addition, there was a bill in passage through the House (January 3,
1820) to admit [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine"] Maine as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_state_(United_States)"] free state.[83] Southern congressmen sought to force northerners to accept
slavery in Missouri by connecting Maine and Missouri statehood. In this plan, endorsed by Monroe, Maine
statehood would be held hostage to slavery in Missouri. In February 1820 the Senate passed a bill for the
admission of Maine with an amendment enabling the people of Missouri to form a state constitution. Before
the bill was returned to the House, a second amendment was adopted on the motion of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_B._Thomas"] Jesse B. Thomas of
Illinois, excluding slavery from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Territory"] Louisiana Territory north of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_36%C2%B030%E2%80%B2_north"] parallel 36°30′ north (the southern
boundary of Missouri), except within the limits of the proposed state of Missouri. The House then approved
 the bill as amended by the Senate.[84]The legislation passed, and became known as "the Missouri
Compromise".  Though Monroe remained firmly opposed to any compromise that restricted slavery
anywhere, he reluctantly signed the Compromise into law (March 6, 1820) only because he believed it was
the least bad alternative for southern slaveholders. The Missouri Compromise temporarily settled the issue
of slavery in the territories.[85]
Internal improvements
As the United States continued to grow, many Americans
advocated a system of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_improvements"] internal improvements to help the country
develop. Federal assistance for such projects evolved slowly and
haphazardly—the product of contentious congressional factions
and an executive branch generally concerned with avoiding
unconstitutional federal intrusions into state affairs.[86] Monroe
believed that the young nation needed an improved infrastructure,
including a  transportation network to grow and thrive
economically, but did not think that the Constitution authorized
Congress to build, maintain, and operate a national transportation
system.[87] Monroe repeatedly urged Congress to pass an
amendment allowing Congress the power to finance internal
improvements, but Congress never acted on his proposal, in part
because many congressmen believed that the Constitution did in
fact authorize the federal financing of internal improvements.[88]
In 1822, Congress passed a bill authorizing the collection of tolls 
 BEP engraved portrait of Monroe as
President
on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland_Road"] Cumberland Road, with the tolls being used to finance
repairs on the road. Adhering to stated position regarding internal
improvements, Monroe vetoed the bill.[88] In an elaborate essay, Monroe set forth his constitutional views
on the subject. Congress might appropriate money, he admitted, but it might not undertake the actual
construction of national works nor assume jurisdiction over them.[89]
Page 14
In 1824, the Supreme Court ruled in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbons_v._Ogden"] Gibbons v. Ogden that the Constitution's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause"] Commerce Clause gave the
federal government the authority to regulate interstate commerce. Shortly thereafter, Congress passed two
important laws that, together, marked the beginning of the federal government's continuous involvement in
civil works. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Survey_Act"] General Survey Act authorized the president to have surveys made of routes for roads and
canals "of national importance, in a commercial or military point of view, or necessary for the transportation
of public mail". The president assigned responsibility for the surveys to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers"] Army Corps of Engineers. The
 second act, passed a month later, appropriated $75,000 to improve navigation on the Ohio and Mississippi
rivers by removing sandbars, snags, and other obstacles. Subsequently, the act was amended to include
other rivers such as the Missouri. This work, too, was given to the Corps of Engineers—the only formally
trained body of engineers in the new republic and, as part of the nation's small army, available to serve the
wishes of Congress and the executive branch.[86]
Panic of 1819
Two years into his presidency, Monroe faced an economic crisis known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_of_1819"] Panic of 1819, the first
major depression to hit the country since the ratification of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution"] Constitution in 1788.[90] The panic stemmed
from declining imports and exports, and sagging agricultural prices[87] as global markets readjusted to
peacetime production and commerce in the aftermath of the War of 1812 and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars"] Napoleonic Wars.[91][92]
The severity of the economic downturn in the U.S. was compounded by excessive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation"] speculation in public
lands,[93][94] fueled by the unrestrained issue of paper money from banks and business concerns.[95][96]
Monroe lacked the power to intervene directly in the economy, as banks were largely regulated by the
states, and he could do little to stem the economic crisis.[97]
Before the onset of the Panic of 1819, some business leaders had called on Congress to increase tariff rates
to address the negative balance of trade and help struggling industries.[98] As the panic spread, Monroe
declined to call a special session of Congress to address the economy. When Congress finally reconvened
in December 1819, Monroe requested an increase in the tariff but declined to recommend specific rates.[99]
Congress would not raise tariff rates until the passage of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_of_1824"] Tariff of 1824.[100] The panic resulted in high
unemployment and an increase in bankruptcies and foreclosures,[87][101] and provoked popular resentment
against banking and business enterprises.[102][103]
Foreign affairs
According to historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_Earl_Weeks&action=edit&redlink=1"] William E. Weeks, "Monroe evolved a comprehensive strategy aimed at expanding
the Union externally while solidifying it internally". He expanded trade and pacified relations with Great
Britain while expanding the United States at the expense of the Spanish Empire, from which he obtained
Florida and the recognition of a border across the continent. Faced with the breakdown of the expansionist
consensus over the question of slavery, the president tried to provide both North and South with guarantees
that future expansion would not tip the balance of power between slave and free states, a system that,
Weeks remarks, did indeed allow the continuation of American expansion for the best of four decades.[104]
Treaties with Britain and Russia
Monroe pursued warmer relations with Britain in the aftermath of the War of 1812.[105] In 1817 the United
States and Britain signed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush%E2%80%93Bagot_Treaty"] Rush–Bagot Treaty, which regulated naval armaments on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes"] Great Lakes and
 Lake Champlain and demilitarized the border between the U.S. and British North America.[106] The Treaty
 of 1818, also with Great Britain, was concluded October 20, 1818, and fixed the present Canada–United
States border from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota"] Minnesota to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains"] Rocky Mountains at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/49th_parallel_north"] 49th parallel. The accords also established a
joint U.S.–British occupation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Country"] Oregon Country for the next ten years.[107] Though they did not solve
Page 15
every outstanding issue between the U.S. and Britain, the treaties allowed for greater trade between the
United States and the British Empire and helped avoid an expensive naval arms race in the Great
Lakes.[105] Late in Monroe's second term, the U.S. concluded the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-American_Treaty_of_1824"] Russo-American Treaty of 1824 with the
 Russian Empire, setting the southern limit of Russian sovereignty on the Pacific coast of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"] North America at
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_54%C2%B040%E2%80%B2_north"] 54°40′ parallel (the present southern tip of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Panhandle"] Alaska Panhandle).[108]
Acquisition of Florida 
Spain had long rejected repeated American efforts to purchase
Florida. But by 1818, Spain was facing a troubling colonial
situation in which the cession of Florida made sense. Spain had
been exhausted by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsular_War"] Peninsular War in Europe and needed to
rebuild its credibility and presence in its colonies. Revolutionaries
in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"] Central America and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"] South America were beginning to demand
independence. Spain was unwilling to invest further in Florida,
encroached on by American settlers, and it worried about the
border between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Spain"] New Spain and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"] United States. With only a
Map showing the results of the
 Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819 
minor military presence in Florida, Spain was not able to restrain
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seminole"] Seminole warriors who routinely crossed the border and raided
American villages and farms, as well as protected southern slave
refugees from slave owners and traders of the southern United
States.[109] The Seminole people were also providing sanctuary for runaway slaves, those of which the
United States wanted back.[110]
In response to Seminole attacks and their provision of aid to escaped slaves, Monroe ordered a military
 expedition to cross into Spanish Florida and attack the Seminoles. In this expedition, led by Andrew
Jackson, the US Army displaced numerous Seminole people from their houses along with burning their
towns. Jackson also seized the Spanish territorial capital of Pensacola. With the capture of Pensacola,
Jackson established de facto American control of the entire territory. While Monroe supported Jackson's
actions, many in Congress harshly criticized what they saw as an undeclared war. With the support of
Secretary of State Adams, Monroe defended Jackson against domestic and international criticism, and the
United States began negotiations with Spain.[111][112][110]
Spain faced revolt in all of its American colonies and could neither govern nor defend Florida. On February
22, 1819, Spain and the United States signed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs_Treaty"] Adams–Onís Treaty, which ceded [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Floridas"] the Floridas in return
for the assumption by the United States of claims of American citizens against Spain to an amount not
exceeding $5,000,000. The treaty also contained a definition of the boundary between Spanish and
American possessions on the North American continent. Beginning at the mouth of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabine_River_(Texas-Louisiana)"] Sabine River the
 line ran along that river to the 32nd parallel, then due north to the Red River, which it followed to the 100th
meridian, due north to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_River"] Arkansas River, and along that river to its source, then north to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42nd_parallel_north"] 42nd parallel,
which it followed to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean"] Pacific Ocean. As the United States renounced all claims to the west and south of
this boundary (Texas), so Spain surrendered any title she had to the Northwest ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Country"] Oregon Country).[113]
Monroe Doctrine
Monroe was deeply sympathetic to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American_wars_of_independence"] Latin American revolutionary movements against Spain. He was
determined that the United States should never repeat the policies of the Washington administration during
the French Revolution, when the nation had failed to demonstrate its sympathy for the aspirations of
peoples seeking to establish republican governments. He did not envisage military involvement in Latin
American affairs, but only the provision of moral support, as he believed that a direct American
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensacola,_Florida"]
Page 16
intervention would provoke other European powers into assisting
Spain.[114] Monroe initially refused to recognize the Latin
American governments due to ongoing negotiations with Spain
over Florida.[115]
In March 1822, Monroe officially recognized the countries of
Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Chile, and Mexico, all of which had
won [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American_wars_of_independence"] independence from Spain.[107] Secretary of State Adams,
under Monroe's supervision, wrote the instructions for the ministers
to these new countries. They declared that the policy of the United
States was to uphold republican institutions and to seek treaties of
commerce on a most-favored-nation basis. The United States
would support inter-American congresses dedicated to the
development of economic and political institutions fundamentally
differing from those prevailing in Europe. Monroe took pride as the
United States was the first nation to extend recognition and to set
an example to the rest of the world for its support of the "cause of
liberty and humanity".[114] 
Portrait of President Monroe by
 Gilbert Stuart, c. 1820-1822
For their part, the British also had a strong interest in ensuring the demise of Spanish colonialism, with all
the trade restrictions [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercantilism"] mercantilism imposed. In October 1823, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rush"] Richard Rush, the American minister in
London, advised that Foreign Secretary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Canning"] George Canning was proposing that the U.S. and Britain issue a
joint declaration to deter any other power from intervening in Central and South America. Adams
vigorously opposed cooperation with Great Britain, contending that a statement of bilateral nature could
limit United States expansion in the future. He also argued that the British were not committed to
recognizing the Latin American republics and must have had imperial motivations themselves.[116]
Two months later, the bilateral statement proposed by the British became a unilateral declaration by the
United States. While Monroe thought that Spain was unlikely to re-establish its colonial empire on its own,
he feared that France or the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Alliance"] Holy Alliance might seek to establish control over the former Spanish
possessions.[117] On December 2, 1823, in his annual message to Congress, Monroe articulated what
became known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine"] Monroe Doctrine. He first reiterated the traditional U.S. policy of neutrality with
regard to European wars and conflicts. He then declared that the United States would not accept the
recolonization of any country by its former European master, though he also avowed non-interference with
existing European colonies in the Americas.[118] Finally, he stated that European countries should no
longer consider the Western Hemisphere open to new colonization, a jab aimed primarily at Russia, which
was attempting to expand its colony on the northern Pacific Coast.[107][114]
Election of 1820
The collapse of the Federalists left Monroe with no organized opposition at the end of his first term, and he
ran for reelection unopposed,[119] the only president other than [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"] Washington to do so. A single elector from
New Hampshire, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Plumer"] William Plumer, cast a vote for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams"] John Quincy Adams, preventing a unanimous vote in the
Electoral College.[119] He did so because he thought Monroe was incompetent. Later in the century, the
story arose that he had cast his dissenting vote so that only George Washington would have the honor of
unanimous election. Plumer never mentioned Washington in his speech explaining his vote to the other
New Hampshire electors.[120]
States admitted to the Union
Page 17
Five new states were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admission_to_the_Union"] admitted to the Union while Monroe was in office:
Mississippi – December 10, 1817[121]
Illinois – December 3, 1818[122]
Alabama – December 14, 1819[123]
Maine – March 15, 1820[124][a]
Missouri – August 10, 1821[126]
Post-presidency (1825–1831)
When his presidency ended
on March 4, 1825, James
 Monroe resided at Monroe
Hill, what is now included
in the grounds of the
 University of Virginia. He
served on the university's
Board of Visitors under
Monroe once owned a farm at the
location of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia"] University of Virginia
in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia"] Charlottesville 
Jefferson and under the
 second rector James
Madison, both former
presidents, almost until his
death. He and his wife
 lived at Oak Hill in Aldie,
Virginia, until Elizabeth's death at age 62 on September 23, 1830.
In August 1825, the Monroes had received [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_de_Lafayette"] Marquis de Lafayette
and President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams"] John Quincy Adams as guests there.[127] 
 Monroe in a 1829 portrait by Chester
Harding
 Monroe incurred many unliquidated debts during his years of public life. He sold off his Highland
Plantation. It is now owned by his alma mater, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_William_and_Mary"] College of William and Mary, which has opened it to
the public as a historic site. Throughout his life, he was financially insolvent, which was exacerbated by his
wife's poor health.[128]
Monroe was elected as a delegate to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Constitutional_Convention_of_1829-1830"] Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1829-1830. He was one of
four delegates elected from the senatorial district made up of his home district of Loudoun and Fairfax
County.[129] In October 1829, he was elected by the convention to serve as the presiding officer, until his
failing health required him to withdraw on December 8, after which [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_P._Barbour"] Philip P. Barbour of Orange County
was elected presiding officer.
 Upon Elizabeth's death in 1830, Monroe moved to 63 Prince Street at Lafayette Place[130] in New York
City to live with his daughter Maria Hester Monroe Gouverneur, who had married [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Gouverneur"] Samuel L. Gouverneur.
Monroe's health began to slowly fail by the end of the 1820s.[131] On July 4, 1831, Monroe died at age 73
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure"] heart failure and tuberculosis, thus becoming the third president to have died on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)"] Independence Day.
His death came 55 years after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence"] United States Declaration of Independence was proclaimed and five
years after the deaths of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson. Monroe was originally buried in New York at
the Gouverneur family's vault in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Marble_Cemetery"] New York City Marble Cemetery. 27 years later, in 1858, his body
 was re-interred at the President's Circle in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. The James Monroe
Tomb is a U.S. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark"] National Historic Landmark.[132]
Page 18
Religious beliefs
"When it comes to Monroe's thoughts on religion," historian Bliss Isely
notes, "less is known than that of any other President." No letters survive in
which he discussed his religious beliefs. Nor did his friends, family or
associates comment on his beliefs. Letters that do survive, such as ones
written after the death of his son, contain no discussion of religion.[133]
Monroe was raised in a family that belonged to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_England"] Church of England
when it was the state church in Virginia before the Revolution. As an adult,
he attended [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America"] Episcopal churches. Some historians see "deistic tendencies" in
his few references to an impersonal God.[134] Unlike Jefferson, Monroe
was rarely attacked as an atheist or infidel. In 1832 James Renwick
Willson, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_Presbyterian_Church_of_North_America"] Reformed Presbyterian minister in Albany, New York, criticized
Monroe for having "lived and died like a second-rate Athenian
philosopher".[135] 
 Monroe's grave at Hollywood
Cemetery
Slavery
Monroe owned dozens of slaves. He took several slaves with him to Washington to serve at the White
House from 1817 to 1825. This was typical of other slaveholders, as Congress did not provide for domestic
staff of the presidents at that time.[136]
As president of Virginia's constitutional convention in the fall of 1829, Monroe reiterated his belief that
slavery was a blight which, even as a British colony, Virginia had attempted to eradicate. "What was the
origin of our slave population?" he rhetorically asked. "The evil commenced when we were in our Colonial
state, but acts were passed by our Colonial Legislature, prohibiting the importation, of more slaves, into the
Colony. These were rejected by the Crown." To the dismay of states' rights proponents, he was willing to
accept the federal government's financial assistance to emancipate and transport freed slaves to other
countries. At the convention, Monroe made his final public statement on slavery, proposing that Virginia
 emancipate and deport its bondsmen with "the aid of the Union".[137]
When Monroe was Governor of Virginia in 1800, hundreds of slaves from Virginia planned to kidnap him,
take Richmond, and negotiate for their freedom. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Prosser"] Gabriel's slave conspiracy was discovered.[138] Monroe
called out the militia; the slave patrols soon captured some slaves accused of involvement. Sidbury says
some trials had a few measures to prevent abuses, such as an appointed attorney, but they were "hardly
'fair'". [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_codes"] Slave codes prevented slaves from being treated like whites, and they were given quick trials without
a jury.[139] Monroe influenced the Executive Council to pardon and sell some slaves instead of hanging
them.[140] Historians say the Virginia courts executed between 26 and 35 slaves. None of the executed
slaves had killed any whites because the uprising had been foiled before it began.[141] An additional 50
slaves charged for their role in the planned rebellion would be spared, as a result of pardons, acquittals, and
commutations. One reason for this was influence of a letter Monroe received from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson"] Thomas Jefferson urging
mercy, telling him "The other states & the world at large will for ever condemn us if we indulge a principle
of revenge, or go one step beyond absolute necessity. They cannot lose sight of the rights of the two parties,
& the object of the unsuccessful one." Only seven of the executions carried out against the rebels occurred
after Monroe received Jefferson's letter.[142]
Monroe was active in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Colonization_Society"] American Colonization Society, which supported the establishment of colonies
outside of the United States for free African-Americans. The society helped send several thousand freed
slaves to the new colony of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia"] Liberia in Africa from 1820 to 1840. Slave owners like Monroe and Andrew
Page 19
Jackson wanted to prevent free blacks from encouraging slaves in the South to rebel. Liberia's capital,
Monrovia, was named after President Monroe.[143]
Legacy
Historical reputation
Polls of historians and political scientists tend to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States"] rank Monroe as an
above average president.[144][145] Monroe presided over a period
in which the United States began to turn away from European
affairs and towards domestic issues. His presidency saw the United
States settle many of its longstanding boundary issues through an
accommodation with Britain and the acquisition of Florida. Monroe
also helped resolve sectional tensions through his support of the
Missouri Compromise and by seeking support from all regions of
the country.[146] Political scientist Fred Greenstein argues that
Monroe was a more effective executive than some of his better-
known predecessors, including Madison and John Adams.[147]

The capital of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia"] Liberia is named [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monrovia"] Monrovia after Monroe; it is the only [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_capitals"] national capital other than
 Washington, D.C. named after a U.S. president. Monroe is the namesake of seventeen Monroe
 counties.[148] Monroe, Maine, Monroe, Michigan, Monroe, Georgia, Monroe, Connecticut, both Monroe
Townships in New Jersey, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Monroe"] Fort Monroe are all named for him. Monroe has been depicted on U.S.
currency and stamps, including a 1954 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service"] United States Postal Service 5¢ [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Issue"] Liberty Issue [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postage_stamp"] postage stamp.
 Monroe was the last U.S. president to wear a powdered wig tied in a queue, a tricorne hat and knee-
breeches according to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1775%E2%80%931795_in_fashion#Men's_fashion"] style of the late 18th century.[149][150] That earned him [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nicknames_of_presidents_of_the_United_States"] the nickname "The Last
Cocked Hat". He was also the last president who was not photographed.[151]
