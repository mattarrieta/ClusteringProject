Cajón
A cajón (Spanish:  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Spanish"] [kaˈxon]; "box", "crate" or "drawer") is a box-shaped
 percussion instrument originally from Peru, played by slapping the front or
rear faces (generally thin plywood) with the hands, fingers, or sometimes
implements such as brushes, mallets, or sticks. Cajones are primarily played
in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Peruvian_music"] Afro-Peruvian music (specifically [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BAsica_criolla"] música criolla), but has made its way
into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamenco"] flamenco as well. The term cajón is also applied to other box drums
used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_American_music"] Latin American music, such as the Cuban [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caj%C3%B3n_de_rumba"] cajón de rumba and the
Mexican [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caj%C3%B3n_de_tapeo"] cajón de tapeo.

Description  Sounds of a cajón in use
Sheets of 13 to 19 mm (1/2 to 3/4 inch) thick wood are generally
used for five sides of the box. A thinner sheet of plywood is nailed on as the sixth side, and acts as the
striking surface or head. The striking surface of the cajón drum is commonly referred to as the tapa.[1] A
 sound hole is cut on the back side. The modern cajón may have rubber feet, and has several screws at the
top for adjusting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussive"] percussive timbre.
Originally the instruments were only wooden boxes, but, thanks to a contribution by Spanish flamenco
exponent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paco_de_Luc%C3%ADa"] Paco de Lucía, now they may have several stretched cords pressed against the top for a buzz-like
effect, resembling a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snare_drum"] snare drum — guitar strings (the original modification), rattles or drum snares may
serve this purpose. Bells may also be installed inside near the cords.
Origins and evolution
The cajón is the most widely used Afro-Peruvian musical instrument since the late 19th century.[2] Slaves
of west and central African origin in the Americas are considered to be the source of the cajón drum.
Currently, the instrument is common in musical performance throughout some of the Americas and Spain.
The cajón was developed during the periods of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery"] slavery in coastal Peru. The instrument reached a peak in
popularity by 1850, and by the end of the 19th century cajón players were experimenting with the design of
Page 2
the instrument by bending some of the planks in the cajón's body to alter
the instrument's patterns of sound vibration.[2] After slavery the cajón was
spread to a much larger audience including Criollos.
Given that the cajón comes from slave musicians in the Spanish colonial
Americas, there are two complementary origin theories for the instrument.
It is possible that the drum is a direct descendant of a number of boxlike
musical instruments from west and central Africa, especially Angola, and
the Antilles. These instruments were adapted by slaves from the Spanish
shipping crates at their disposal. In port cities like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matanzas,_Cuba"] Matanzas, Cuba, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codfish"] codfish
shipping crates and small dresser drawers became similar instruments.[3]
Peruvian musician and ethnomusicologist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susana_Baca"] Susana Baca recounts her
mother's story that the cajón originated as "the box of the people who
carried fruit and worked in the ports," putting it down to play on whenever
they had a moment.[4] Another theory is that slaves used boxes as musical
instruments to subvert Spanish colonial bans on music in predominantly
African areas, essentially disguising their instruments.[3]

While early 20th century versions of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festejo"] festejo appeared to have been
performed without the cajón, especially due to the influence of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per%C3%BA_Negro"] Perú Negro, a musical ensemble founded in
1969, the cajón began to be more important than the guitar and, indeed, became "a new symbol of Peruvian
blackness".[5]
After a short 1977 visit to a diplomat’s party and a TV presentation in Lima along with Peruvian
percussionist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitro_Soto"] Caitro Soto, Spanish [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamenco"] flamenco guitar player [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paco_de_Luc%C3%ADa"] Paco de Lucía brought a cajón to Spain to use it
in his own music, after being impressed by the rhythmic possibilities of the instrument.[4][6] In 2001, the
cajón was declared National Heritage by the Peruvian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Culture"] National Institute of Culture.[7] In 2014, the
 Organization of American States declared the cajón an "Instrument of Peru for the Americas".[8]
Contemporary music
In the 2000s (decade), the cajón is heard extensively in Coastal
Peruvian musical styles[9][10] such as Tondero, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinera"] Zamacueca and
 Peruvian Waltz, Spanish modern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamenco"] Flamenco and certain styles of
modern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Rumba"] Cuban Rumba. The modern cajón is often used to
accompany a solo [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_guitar"] acoustic guitar or piano. The cajón is becoming
rapidly popular in blues, pop, rock, funk, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_music"] world music, jazz, etc.
The cajón is often used as a bass drum by bands instead of a full
drum kit when performing in minimalist settings, as the cajón can
simultaneously serve as both a bass drum and a seat for the
drummer. Though occasionally played by some bands in place of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhr%C3%A1n"] bodhrán, the cajón has not become a popular instrument in the
 folk music of Ireland, where the quieter and higher-pitched
 bodhrán traditional frame drum serves the same purpose, and has a
unique playing style.

Playing styles

The player sits astride the box, tilting it at an angle while striking the head between their knees. The
percussionist can play the sides with the top of their palms and fingers for additional sounds. Some
percussionists attach a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_drum"] bass drum pedal to the instrument, enabling them to play it with a single foot.
The instrument has been played not only with hands, but also with plastic and metal brushes, as used for
 drum kits, for example with the Pen Technique, developed by Patrizio Migliarini, which allows the
musician to play jazz and funky rhythms with a completeness and dynamic richness close to that of a
drums, through the use of metal brushes. Another way of playing the cajón is to use an ordinary bass drum
pedal, thus turning the cajón into an indirect percussion instrument which can be played with the feet. This
enables the player to beat it just like a pedal-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_drum"] bass drum, thus leaving the hands (and one other foot) free to
play other instruments. On the other hand, it also restricts the player's standard cajón-playing position, as
when the cajón is placed on the ground, in the bass drum location, it is hard for the performer to slap it with
her or his hands.
