Slit drum
A slit drum or slit gong is a hollow [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussion_instrument"] percussion instrument. In
spite of the name, it is not a true [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum"] drum but an idiophone, usually
carved or constructed from bamboo or wood into a box with one
or more slits in the top. Most slit drums have one slit, though two
and three slits (cut into the shape of an "H") occur. If the resultant
tongues are different width or thicknesses, the drum will produce
two different pitches. It is used throughout Africa, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"] Southeast Asia,
and Oceania. In Africa such drums, strategically situated for
optimal acoustic transmission (e.g., along a river or valley), have
been used for long-distance communication.[1]
The ends of a slit drum are closed so that the shell becomes the
resonating chamber for the sound [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation"] vibrations created when the
tongues are struck, usually with a mallet. The resonating chamber
increases the volume of the sound produced by the tongue and
presents the sound through an open port. If the resonating chamber
is the correct size for the pitch being produced by the tongue,
which means it has the correct volume of airspace to complete one
full [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_wave"] sound wave for that particular pitch, the instrument will be
more efficient and louder.

 West Province.
The people of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanuatu"] Vanuatu cut a large log with "totem" type carvings on the outer surface and hollow out the
center leaving only a slit down the front. This hollowed out log gives the deep resonance of drums when hit
on the outside with sticks.
