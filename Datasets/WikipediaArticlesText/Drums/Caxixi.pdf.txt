Caxixi
A caxixi (pronounced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Portuguese"] [kaˈʃiʃi]) is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percussion_instrument"] percussion instrument consisting
of a closed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket"] basket with a flat bottom filled with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeds"] seeds or other
small particles. The round bottom is traditionally cut from a dried
gourd. The caxixi is an indirectly struck idiophone. Like the
maraca, it is sounded by shaking. Variations in sound are produced
by varying the angle at which the caxixi is shaken, determining
whether the contents strike the reed basket (softer sound) or the
hard bottom (louder, sharper sound). 
Caxixis
It is found across [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"] Africa and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"] South America, but mainly in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"] Brazil
and Cuba, used in staging the ritual. In Brazil, the smaller-sized
caxixi began to be played alongside the berimbau. The larger sized
caxixi were first used on recordings by Airto Moreira, but it was
Naná Vasconcelos who furthered the use of caxixi for rhythmic
accompaniment and colors.[1] In West Africa, it is used by singers
and often alongside drummers. Natives believed the caxixi to
summon good enchanted spirits and to ward off evil ones.
More modern caxixis are made out of metal and have a more
cutting sound as a result.
