GAUSS (software)
GAUSS is a matrix [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language"] programming language for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"] mathematics and
statistics, developed and marketed by Aptech Systems. Its
primary purpose is the solution of numerical problems in
statistics, econometrics, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-series"] time-series, optimization and 2D- and
3D-visualization. It was first published in 1984 for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS"] MS-DOS and
is available for Linux, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS"] macOS and Windows.[1]

Description
A program for generating GAUSS procedures for computing
algorithmic derivatives.
Solves the general maximum likelihood problem subject to
general constraints on the parameters.
Solves the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming"] nonlinear programming problem subject to general
constraints on the parameters.
Nonlinear [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting"] curve fitting.
Basic sample statistics including means, frequencies and
crosstabs. This application is backwards compatible with
programs written with Descriptive Statistics 3.1.
Basic sample statistics including means, frequencies and
crosstabs. This application is thread-safe and takes advantage of
structures.
A statistical package for estimating [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_choice"] discrete choice and other
models in which the dependent variable is qualitative in some
way.
Comprehensive suite of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_conditional_heteroskedasticity#GARCH"] GARCH (Generalized AutoRegressive
Conditional Heteroskedastic) models for estimating volatility.
Solves small and large scale [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming"] linear programming problems.
 Least squares estimation.
Analysis of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable"] categorical data using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-linear_analysis"] log-linear analysis.
 Maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters of statistical
models.
Solves [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_polynomial_equations"] systems of nonlinear equations having as many equations
as unknowns.
Unconstrained optimization.
Exact ML estimation of VARMAX, VARMA, ARIMAX, ARIMA,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_model"] ECM models subject to general constraints on the
parameters. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panel_data"] Panel data estimation. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_root_test"] Cointegration and unit root
