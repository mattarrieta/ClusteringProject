Analytica (software)
Analytica is a visual software developed by Lumina Decision
Systems for creating, analyzing and communicating quantitative
decision models.[1] It combines hierarchical [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_diagram"] influence diagrams for
visual creation and view of models, intelligent arrays for working
with multidimensional data, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_simulation"] Monte Carlo simulation for analyzing
risk and uncertainty, and optimization, including linear and
nonlinear programming. Its design, especially its influence
diagrams and treatment of uncertainty, is based on ideas from the
field of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis"] decision analysis. As a computer language, it combines a
declarative (non-procedural) structure for referential transparency,
array abstraction, and automatic dependency maintenance for
efficient sequencing of computation.

Hierarchical influence diagrams
Analytica models are organized as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_diagram"] influence diagrams. Variables (and other objects) appear as nodes of
various shapes on a diagram, connected by arrows that provide a visual representation of dependencies.
Analytica influence diagrams may be hierarchical, in which a single module node on a diagram represents
an entire submodel.
Hierarchical influence diagrams in Analytica serve as an organizational tool. Because the visual layout of
an influence diagram matches these natural human abilities both spatially and in the level of abstraction,
people are able to take in more information about a model's structure and organization at a glance than is
possible with less visual paradigms, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadsheet"] spreadsheets and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_expression"] mathematical expressions. Managing the
structure and organization of a large model can be a significant part of the modeling process, but is
substantially aided by the visualization of influence diagrams.
Page 2
Influence diagrams also serve as a tool for communication. Once a quantitative model has been created and
its final results computed, it is often the case that an understanding of how the results are obtained, and how
various assumptions impact the results, is far more important than the specific numbers computed.
Analytica gives users the ability to help target audiences understand these aspects within their models. The
visual representation of an influence diagram quickly communicates an understanding at a level of
abstraction that is normally more appropriate than detailed representations such as mathematical expressions
or cell formulas. When more detail is desired, users can drill down to increasing levels of detail, speeded by
the visual depiction of the model's structure.
The existence of an easily understandable and transparent model supports communication and debate
within an organization, and this effect is one of the primary benefits of quantitative model building. When
all interested parties are able to understand a common model structure, debates and discussions will often
focus more directly on specific assumptions, can cut down on "cross-talk", and therefore lead to more
productive interactions within the organization. The influence diagram serves as a graphical representation
that can help to make models accessible to people at different levels.
Intelligent multidimensional arrays
Analytica uses index objects to track the dimensions of multidimensional arrays. An index object has a
name and a list of elements. When two multidimensional values are combined, for example in an
expression such as
Profit = Revenue − Expenses
where Revenue and Expenses are each multidimensional, Analytica repeats the profit calculation over each
dimension, but recognizes when same dimension occurs in both values and treats it as the same dimension
during the calculation, in a process called intelligent array abstraction.  Unlike most programming
languages, there is no inherent ordering to the dimensions in a multidimensional array. This avoids
duplicated formulas and explicit FOR loops, both common sources of modeling errors. The simplified
expressions made possible by intelligent array abstraction allow the model to be more accessible,
interpretable, and transparent.
Another consequence of intelligent array abstraction is that new dimensions can be introduced or removed
from an existing model, without requiring changes to the model structure or changes to variable definitions.
For example, while creating a model, the model builder might assume a particular variable, for example
 discount_rate, contains a single number. Later, after constructing a model, a user might replace the single
number with a table of numbers, perhaps discount_rate broken down by Country and by
Economic_scenario. These new divisions may reflect the fact that the effective discount rate is not the same
for international divisions of a company, and that different rates are applicable to different hypothetical
scenarios. Analytica automatically propagates these new dimensions to any results that depend upon
discount_rate, so for example, the result for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value"] Net present value will become multidimensional and contain
these new dimensions. In essence, Analytica repeats the same calculation using the discount rate for each
possible combination of Country and Economic_scenario.
This flexibility is important when exploring computation tradeoffs between the level of detail, computation
time, available data, and overall size or dimensionality of parametric spaces. Such adjustments are common
after models have been fully constructed as a way of exploring [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What-if_analysis"] what-if scenarios and overall relationships
between variables.
Uncertainty analysis
Page 3
Incorporating uncertainty into model outputs helps to provide more realistic and informative projections.
Uncertain quantities in Analytica can be specified using a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution"] distribution function. When evaluated,
distributions are sampled using either [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_hypercube_sampling"] Latin hypercube, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_simulation"] Monte Carlo, or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobol_sequence"] Sobol sampling, then the samples
are propagated through the computations to the results. The sampled result distribution and summary
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_distribution_function"] statistics can then be viewed directly (mean, fractile bands, probability density function (PDF), cumulative
 distribution function (CDF)),  Analytica supports collaborative decision analysis and probability
management through the use of the SIPMath(tm) standard.[2][3]
Systems dynamics modeling
 System dynamics is an approach to simulating the behaviour of complex systems over time. It deals with
feedback loops and time delays on the behaviour of the entire system. The Dynamic() function in Analytica
 allows definition of variables with cyclic dependencies, such as feedback loops. It expands the influence
diagram notation, which does not normally allow cycles. At least one link in each cycle includes a time lag,
depicted as a gray influence arrow to distinguish it from standard black arrows without time lags.
As a programming language
Analytica includes a general language of operators and functions for expressing mathematical relationships
among variables. Users can define functions and libraries to extend the language.
Analytica has several features as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language"] programming language designed to make it easy to use for quantitative
 modeling: It is a visual programming language, where users view programs (or "models") as influence
diagrams, which they create and edit visually by adding and linking nodes. It is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming_language"] declarative language,
meaning that a model declares a definition for each variable without specifying an execution sequence as
required by conventional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming_language"] imperative languages. Analytica determines a correct and efficient execution
sequence using the dependency graph. It is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referentially_transparent"] referentially transparent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming_language"] functional language, in that execution
 of functions and variables have no side effects i.e. changing other variables. Analytica is an array
programming language, where operations and functions generalize to work on multidimensional arrays.

History
Analytica's predecessor, called Demos,[83] grew from the research on tools for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_analysis"] policy analysis by Max
Henrion as a PhD student and later professor at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University"] Carnegie Mellon University between 1979 and 1990.
Henrion founded Lumina Decision Systems in 1991 with Brian Arnold. Lumina continued to develop the
software and apply it to environmental and public policy analysis applications. Lumina first released
Analytica as a product in 1996.
