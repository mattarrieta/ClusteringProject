A+ (programming language)
A+ is an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming_language"] array programming language descended from the
 programming language A,[2] which in turn was created to replace
 APL in 1988.[3] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Whitney_(computer_scientist)"] Arthur Whitney developed the A portion of A+,
while other developers at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley"] Morgan Stanley extended it, adding a
graphical user interface and other language features. A+ is a high-
level, interactive, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language"] interpreted language, designed for numerically
intensive applications, especially those found in financial
applications. A+ runs on many [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix"] Unix variants, including Linux. It
 is free and open source software released under a GNU General
Public License.
A+ provides an extended set of functions and operators, a
 graphical user interface with automatic synchronizing of widgets
and variables, asynchronous executing of functions associated with
variables and events, dynamic loading of user compiled
subroutines, and other features. A newer graphical user interface
has not yet been ported to all supported platforms
The A+ language implements the following changes to the APL
language:
an A+ function may have up to nine formal parameters
A+ code statements are separated by semicolons, so a
single statement may be divided into two or more
physical lines
The explicit result of a function or operator is the result
of the last statement executed
A+ implements an object called a dependency, which is
a global variable (the dependent variable) and an
associated definition that is like a function with no
arguments. Values can be explicitly set and referenced
in exactly the same ways as for a global variable, but
they can also be set through the associated definition.
Interactive A+ development is primarily done in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xemacs"] Xemacs
editor, through extensions to the editor. Because A+ code uses the
original APL symbols, displaying A+ requires a font with those
special characters; a font named kapl is provided on the web site
for that purpose.

Influenced
 K
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Whitney_(computer_scientist)"] Arthur Whitney went on to create a proprietary array language named K. Like J, K omits the APL
character set. It lacks some of the perceived complexities of A+, such as the existence of statements and
two different modes of syntax.
