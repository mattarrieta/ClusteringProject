Background
Patel was born on May 15, 1990, in Viramgam, Gujarat, India. By
2015, he was married to Palak, and the couple were traveling
together to visit relatives in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"] United States. Patel was 24 at the
time while Palak was 21.[2]
Murder
On the night of April 12, 2015, Patel and Palak were working a
night shift at a Dunkin' Donuts in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanover,_Maryland"] Hanover, Maryland. The store
was owned by a relative of Patel whom the couple were visiting.
Surveillance footage showed Palak and Patel walking together in
the kitchen at around 9:30 p.m. before disappearing out of view
behind some racks.[3] Moments later, Patel re-emerged without his
wife, turned off an oven, and left the store.[3]
The body of 21-year-old Palak Patel was found later that night.
She had been beaten to death and stabbed multiple times with a
large kitchen knife. Investigators believe the couple had an
argument, with Palak [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deportation"] wanting to return to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"] India and Patel wishing
to remain in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"] U.S. instead.[4]

Aftermath
Customers arriving at the Dunkin' Donuts store grew concerned
when no employees came to serve them. A police officer who
happened to be near the store was approached by concerned
customers and checked out the scene. Upon searching the store the
officer found Palak's body. Police then checked the surveillance
video and realized the killer was Patel, who had vanished. Patel
was not identified as the suspect until over an hour after the
murder, giving him time to escape.[5]
After murdering Palak, Patel fled the store and returned to his
nearby apartment on foot. He took some personal items and then
got a cab to a hotel near an airport in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newark,_New_Jersey"] Newark, New Jersey. The
taxi driver reported that Patel was very calm during the journey.
He checked into a hotel in Newark and was seen on surveillance
video at the counter paying in cash for a room. He checked out the
following morning.[5]

 Patel was last seen on the morning of April 13, 2015, around 10 a.m. at Newark Penn Station in New
Jersey. He took a hotel shuttle to the station and has not been seen since.[6]
Investigation
Authorities believe Patel could have fled the country or could be hiding with relatives. Patel had a visa to
be in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"] U.S., but [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States#Visa_overstay"] it had expired by the time he carried out the murder. A report stated that because of this,
there was no indication he was able to legally leave the country.[4]
An investigation with Palak's family into the murder revealed that the last conversation she had with them
was about wishing to return home to India. This call was made moments before Palak was murdered by her
husband and had been overheard by him. Police believe that Patel murdered his wife for this reason.[5]
Patel has connections in Canada, India, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey"] New Jersey, Kentucky, Georgia, and Illinois. A reward of up to
$100,000 is available for information that leads to his whereabouts.[7]
