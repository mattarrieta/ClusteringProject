Bulbasaur
Bulbasaur[a] is a Grass/Poison-type [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_species"] Pokémon species in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo"] Nintendo
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Freak"] Game Freak's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon"] Pokémon franchise. It is the first in the
 franchise's monster index, called a Pokédex. Designed by Atsuko
Nishida,[1] Bulbasaur debuted in Pocket Monsters: Red and Green
([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue"] Pokémon Red and Blue outside Japan) as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starter_Pok%C3%A9mon"] starter Pokémon.
Since then, it has reappeared in subsequent sequels, spin-off
games, related merchandise, and animated and printed adaptations
of the franchise. 
Bulbasaur
 Pokémon character
Known as the Seed Pokémon, Bulbasaur can survive for days
solely on sunlight. It likes to take a nap in the sunshine. While it
sleeps, the seed on its back catches the rays and uses the energy to
grow. It is a central character in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(anime)"] the Pokémon anime, being one of
 Ash Ketchum's main Pokémon for the first season, and a different
one later being obtained by May. It is featured in various manga,
and is owned by protagonist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_(Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures)"] Red in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures"] Pokémon Adventures
manga. Bulbasaur has been featured in myriad pieces of
merchandise, including toys, key chains, and plush dolls.
Bulbasaur can evolve into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_generation_I_Pok%C3%A9mon"] Ivysaur at level 16, and can further
evolve into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venusaur"] Venusaur at level 32. Venusaur can also evolve into
Mega Venusaur if the player equips it with a Venusaurite, but this
 feature was only first added to the Pokémon games in Pokémon X
and Y.
The fan wiki Bulbapedia, a wiki dedicated solely to the Pokémon
franchise, is named after Bulbasaur.

Conception and design
 Bulbasaur was designed by Atsuko Nishida, one of the character designers for Pocket Monsters Red and
Blue, who based its design on Ivysaur, the mid-evolved form of Bulbasaur.[1] The species first appeared as
one of three [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay_of_Pok%C3%A9mon#Starter_Pok.C3.A9mon"] starter Pokémon the player could choose from at the beginning of the initial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy"] Game Boy games,
 Pokémon Red and Blue, released in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"] Japan in 1996.[2] Its Japanese name, Fushigidane (fu-SHI-gi-DAHN-
eh),  is a combination of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language"] Japanese words for mystery or miracle (fushigi) and seed (tane).[3] In
translating the game for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language"] English speaking audiences, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo"] Nintendo gave the Pokémon "cleverly descriptive
names" related to their appearance or features as a means to make the characters more relatable to American
children; thus Bulbasaur, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau"] portmanteau relating to both its dinosaurian appearance and the large garlic-
shaped bulb on its back.[4] Both the etymology and appearance of Bulbasaur, Ivysaur and Venusaur
convey a transition of this Pokémon from the harmless to the dangerous as it evolves.[5] The idea to feature
Bulbasaur and the other Red and Blue starters in a significant role in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_X_and_Y"] Pokémon X and Y came about a year
and a half into the development of the games. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay_of_Pok%C3%A9mon#Mega_Evolution"] Mega Evolutions for the three Pokémon's final forms
were created, and the designers decided that they should give players an opportunity to receive one of these
Pokémon from Professor Sycamore, the games professor, to see their Mega Evolved form.[6]
Characteristics
Despite their English names, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Sugimori"] Ken Sugimori confirmed that the design of Bulbasaur and its evolutions are
based on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onions"] onions and frogs,[7] albeit identified more with a smaller Dicynodont. In the Pokémon franchise,
Bulbasaur are small, squat [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian"] amphibian and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"] plant Pokémon that move on all four legs, and have blue-green
bodies with darker blue-green spots. As a Bulbasaur undergoes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_evolution"] evolution into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivysaur"] Ivysaur and then later into
Venusaur, the bulb on its back blossoms into a large flower.[8] The seed on a Bulbasaur's back is planted at
birth and then sprouts and grows larger as the Bulbasaur grows.[9] The bulb absorbs sunlight which allows
it to grow, and for this reason, Bulbasaur enjoy soaking up the sun's rays.[10] They can also survive for
days without eating because the bulb stores energy.[11] The distinctive differences of Bulbasaur from other
Pokémon such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diglett"] Diglett are well understood by children and so motivate their play and trading of the
creature.[12]
Appearances
In the video games
 Bulbasaur made its video game debut on February 27, 1996, in the Japanese-language games Pocket
Monsters Red and Green.[13] Along with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charmander"] Charmander and Squirtle, Bulbasaur is a starter Pokémon the
 player can choose from at the beginning of the games.[14] Bulbasaur's dual typing of Grass and Poison type
 (https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/bulbasaur) is in contrast to Charmander's Fire type and Squirtle's Water
type.[14] Bulbasaur is the only starter in Red, Blue, and Green that has a dual typing. Bulbasaur and the
other starters from Red and Blue are replaced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikachu"] Pikachu in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Yellow"] Pokémon Yellow, the only starter available in it.
 Instead, they are obtained throughout the game from several NPCs.[14] In Pokémon FireRed and
LeafGreen, remakes of Red and Blue, Bulbasaur is selectable as a starter Pokémon once again, along with
Charmander and Squirtle. In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_HeartGold_and_SoulSilver"] Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, after obtaining all sixteen badges and
defeating Red, the player can choose to obtain either Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle.[15] You can also
 find them in the Pal Park field in Pokemon Diamond and Pearl, Pokemon Platinum and Pokemon
HeartGold and SoulSilver. In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_X_and_Y"] Pokémon X and Y, players can also choose between Bulbasaur, Charmander,
and Squirtle near the start of the game shortly after having chosen the games' new starter Pokémon. In
 Pokémon Sword and Shield: The Isle Of Armor, you can find one in the Master Dojo.

The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64"] Nintendo 64 spin-off [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Stadium"] Pokémon Stadium, and other spin-offs such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mystery_Dungeon"] Pokémon Mystery Dungeon, give
the player a choice of a Bulbasaur (among fifteen other Pokémon), and in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Snap"] Pokémon Snap, Bulbasaur are
one of the Pokémon that the player can photograph.[2] It also appears in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Puzzle_League"] Pokémon Puzzle League as one of
Ash's Pokémon. Bulbasaur also appears in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_You,_Pikachu!"] Hey You, Pikachu! as a supporting character who lives in the
Ochre Woods and makes the five recipes with Pikachu's help.[16] In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee"] Super Smash Bros. Melee and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl"] Brawl,
 Bulbasaur appears as one of the obtainable trophies.[17][18] Bulbasaur appears in PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's
Adventure as the host of a mini-game called "Daring Dash". In 2016, Bulbasaur was one of the four starter
Pokémon in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go"] Pokémon Go,[19] and appearing also in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Unite"] Pokémon Unite[20] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Pok%C3%A9mon_Snap"] New Pokémon Snap.[21]
In the anime
Scenes from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(anime)"] Pokémon anime have depicted both the characters Ash and May training a Bulbasaur at
different times, with Ash's Bulbasaur garnering more prominence within the storylines.[22][23] Ash's
Bulbasaur has remained with Ash longer than all of his other Pokémon, with the exception of his Pikachu.
Before joining Ash's team, it lives with a girl named Melanie, who takes care of abandoned Pokémon.[22]
Bulbasaur is given to Ash, but it is pessimistic about him. However, its loyalties begin to improve and it
eventually becomes one of Ash's most faithful Pokémon.[22][23] May catches a Bulbasaur while traveling
in a grass-type Pokémon [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_reserve"] nature reserve during her journey in Hoenn. Bulbasaur defends her from the other
grass Pokémon in the forest, who see her as a threat, and when May leaves, Bulbasaur decides to go with
her.[24] She later makes a guest appearance on the series and it is revealed that her Bulbasaur has fully
evolved into a Venusaur.[25]
In the original Japanese version the two Bulbasaur are each played by separate voice actresses, Ash's
Bulbasaur by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megumi_Hayashibara"] Megumi Hayashibara and May's by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyako_It%C5%8D"] Miyako Itō. In the English dub, they are both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting"] voiced by
 Tara Jayne until Michele Knotz took over the job for the ninth season.
In other media
 Bulbasaur is featured in an eclectic range of different Pokémon manga series. In Pokémon: Pikachu Shocks
Back, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon:_Electric_Pikachu_Boogaloo"] Electric Pikachu Boogaloo, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon:_Surf%27s_Up,_Pikachu!"] Surf's Up, Pikachu!, which loosely parallel the storyline of the
anime, Pikachu is separated from Ash temporarily, and travels with a Bulbasaur to a secret Pokémon village
in the mountains. Later, Ash finds Pikachu and catches the Bulbasaur. Bulbasaur accompanies Ash
throughout his journeys in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Islands_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"] Orange Islands, and eventually fights in the final showdown with Drake, the
Orange Crew Supreme Gym Leader. In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Pok%C3%A9mon_Journey"] Magical Pokémon Journey, a character named Pistachio has a
female Bulbasaur (nicknamed Danerina in the Japanese version), who is infatuated by him.[26]
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures"] Pokémon Adventures, a manga based on the plot of the Pokémon Red and Blue games, the character
 Red receives a Bulbasaur from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_characters#Professors"] Professor Oak, which he nicknames Saur.[27] In Chapter 15, "Wartortle
Wars", it evolves into an Ivysaur after battling a wild Mankey.[28] A Bulbasaur owned by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"] Red appeared in
 the first episode of Pokemon Generations. Bulbasaur is the main character of two Pokémon children's
books, Pokémon Tales Volume 3: Bulbasaur's Trouble and Bulbasaur's Bad Day, published in 1999 and
2000 respectively by Sagebrush.[29][30] In Pokémon Tales Volume 3: Bulbasaur's Trouble, Bulbasaur
resolves an argument between two other Pokémon.[30] In Bulbasaur's Bad Day, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meowth"] Meowth traps Bulbasaur
in a pit and it has to outwit Team Rocket (the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist"] antagonists of the Pokémon anime) to escape.[29] Bulbasaur
also appears in the movie [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Pikachu_(film)"] Pokemon: Detective Pikachu, where they helps lead Pikachu for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewtwo"] Mewtwo to
heal.[31] In making the film, a bulldog was used to understand the top-heavy movement of Bulbasaur. Then
puppeteers in London were hired to create 3D puppets of it. Facial expressions and texture details were
added using CGI.[32]

[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(board_game)"] Bulbasaur is set to be featured alongside other iconic Generation I Pokémon in a version of the Labyrinth
board game in 2021.[33]
Promotion and merchandising
Bulbasaur has been featured in varying pieces of merchandise, including toys and plush dolls.[34]
Bulbasaur has been depicted in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_figure"] action figures sold by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasbro"] Hasbro in the United States, while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomy"] Tomy in Japan

Bulbasaur on the reverse side.[41]
 Bulbasaur was also among the eleven Pokémon chosen as Japan's mascots in the 2014 FIFA World
Cup.[42]
Reception and legacy
Bulbasaur has been largely praised by critics for its appearance, especially in the Pokémon anime. Nintendo
World Report's Pedro Hernandez called it his favorite Pokémon, noting that it represented a number of firsts
for him: his first episode of the anime, his first Pokémon, and the first one he saw in 3D. Calling Bulbasaur
the reason he became interested in the Pokémon series, he stated that he was "deeply touched" by how it
refused to evolve in the anime in order to "prove his self-worth as his un-evolved form".[43] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN"] IGN editor
 "Pokémon of the Day Chick" also praised Ash's "attitude-packing Bulbasaur" in the anime,[44] and Official
Nintendo Magazine's John Vekinis attributed his "love of Grass-type Pokémon" to Bulbasaur in spite of the
Grass type's weaknesses.[45]
Chris Plante of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_(website)"] Polygon called Bulbasaur "the best Pokémon all along", citing that series producer and
director [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junichi_Masuda"] Junichi Masuda defended Bulbasaur as the best starter Pokémon, calling it "really cute, as a
character," and "a very Pokémon-like Pokémon" that "kind of exemplifies what Pokémon is for me" due to
its monster and plant combination. Plante called Bulbsaur and its evolutions "comparably dull", but,
nevertheless, stated that they were "the most true to life", as it looked more "leathery and aged" as it got
older in comparison to the other starters.[46] Cass Marshall and Julia Lee of the same publication described
Bulbasaur on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Pikachu_(film)"] Detective Pikachu as "unassuming and sweet," a creature who makes a "lovable friend."[31]
