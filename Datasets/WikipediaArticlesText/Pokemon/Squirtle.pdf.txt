Squirtle
Squirtle[4] ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈskwɜːrtəl/), known as Zenigame ( 
ゼニガメ) in
Japan, is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon"] Pokémon species in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo"] Nintendo and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Freak"] Game Freak's
 Pokémon franchise. It was designed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atsuko_Nishida"] Atsuko Nishida.[1] Its
name was changed from Zenigame to Squirtle during the English
localization of the series in order to give it a "clever and descriptive
name." Its name is composed of squir- from squirt and -tle from
Turtle. In animated appearances, Squirtle is voiced in Japanese by
 Rikako Aikawa and in English localizations by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Stuart"] Eric Stuart, and
later [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michele_Knotz"] Michele Knotz. Squirtle, in the anime, never evolved for
reasons which are never truly explained by the creators.

Design and characteristics
 Squirtle was designed as one of the starter Pokémon of Pocket
Monsters Red and Green by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atsuko_Nishida"] Atsuko Nishida, who based its design
on its final form,[1] a turtle-esque Pokémon that ultimately was
scrapped and replaced with Blastoise.[6] Originally called
"Zenigame" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various
Pokémon species "clever and descriptive names" related to their
appearance or features when translating the game for western
audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to
American children.[7] Squirtle's English name is a portmanteau of
the words "squirt" and "turtle."[8]

Squirtle, known as the Tiny Turtle Pokémon, are turtle Pokémon
with large eyes and chubby cheeks, capable of moving either on
two feet or on all fours. Their skin is a light blue, and they possess
a long, curled tail. When feeling threatened, Squirtle withdraw

their limbs into their brown-orange shells and spray water from Type Water
their mouth with great force, either to attack their opponent or
merely to intimidate it.[9] If attacked anyway, their shells are resilient, and provide excellent protection. It
shelters itself in its shell, then strikes back with spouts of water at every opportunity.[10] Squirtle's shell is
not merely used for protection. The shell's rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minimize
resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.[11] The idea to feature Squirtle and the
other Red and Blue starters in a significant role in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_X_and_Y"] Pokémon X and Y came about a year and a half into the
development of the games. The Mega Evolutions for the three Pokémon's final forms were created, and the
designers decided that they should give players an opportunity to receive one of these Pokémon in order to
see their Mega Evolved form.[12]
Appearances
In the video games
The first video game appearance of Squirtle was in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue"] Pokémon Red and Blue, then appearing on other

the command of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trainer#Super_Smash_Bros._Brawl"] Pokémon Trainer,[17] alongside [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivysaur"] Ivysaur and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charizard"] Charizard which must be switched
 between in order to avoid fatiguing the Pokémon.[17] Squirtle returns as a playable character in Super
Smash Bros. Ultimate for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch"] Nintendo Switch, once again linked with Ivysaur and Charizard, although the
removal of the fatigue mechanic means that an entire match can be played effectively using Squirtle
alone.[18]
In anime
In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(anime)"] animated series, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Ketchum"] Ash Ketchum, Brock, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misty_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"] Misty encounter a gang of five Squirtle known as the
Squirtle Squad in his debut episode "Here Comes the Squirtle Squad!". They first appear as delinquents,
but their interactions with Ash and Co. result in them becoming honorary firefighters of their town. The
leader of the gang, however, chooses to go with Ash and battle for him; throughout Ash's journey through
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanto_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"] Kanto region, it is an invaluable member of Ash's team, and proves its strength without ever evolving.
Eventually, the Squirtle parts ways with Ash in order to lead its old gang, who were suffering a lack of
Page 3
proper guidance. Despite returning to its hometown, Squirtle will happily aid Ash whenever he requests it.
Whenever Squirtle appears he puts on a pair of black pointed sunglasses. Some think he does this because
his Pokédex number is 007 which relates to the movie [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond"] James Bond. Ash's second female companion, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"] May
received her own Squirtle from Professor Oak. May's Squirtle was very young and timid until evolving,
despite being recently born, it quickly grows accustomed to the Pokémon Contests May participates in,
even helping May win some, earning Ribbons as rewards. After May leaves Ash's group, she temporarily
reunites with him in Sinnoh, revealing that many of her Pokémon had now evolved; Squirtle has since
evolved into Wartortle. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Stuart"] Eric Stuart does the voice of Squirtle up until late in Ash's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoenn"] Hoenn adventure;
 Michelle Knotz takes over his role afterwards.
Squirtle is also the main protagonist of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mystery_Dungeon:_Team_Go-Getters_Out_Of_The_Gate!"] Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Team Go-Getters Out Of The Gate!;
this Squirtle actually happens to be a young boy, transformed and sent to a world completely inhabited by
Pokémon.
Squirtle also appeared in the background of the movie [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Detective_Pikachu"] Detective Pikachu.[19]
In other media
Green, the original female protagonist in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures"] Pokémon Adventures, stole a Squirtle from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Oak"] Professor Oak's
laboratory. It was not seen until Chapter 15, "Wartortle Wars", by which point it had evolved into a
Wartortle, nicknamed Turtley, which she used to try and escape from another trainer, Red, chasing her.[20]
In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon:_Pikachu_Shocks_Back"] Pokémon: Pikachu Shocks Back manga, when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikachu"] Pikachu is separated from Ash temporarily it meets a
cynical Squirtle, who believes Ash has abandoned Pikachu. Later, Ash has caught a Squirtle of his own,
which accompanies Ash throughout his journeys in the Orange Islands.
Reception
Since it appeared in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon"] Pokémon series, Squirtle has received generally positive reception. It has been
 featured in several forms of merchandise, including figurines, plush toys, and the Pokémon Trading Card
Game. Squirtle was featured among other Pokémon as part of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King"] Burger King kids' meal cards.[21] Analysts
predicted that Squirtle, along with Pikachu, Bulbasaur, and Charmander, would lead the merchandising of
the Pokémon series.[22] David Caballero of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Rant"] Screen Rant included Squirtle on the 10 cutest water-types
Pokémon.[23] Andrew Webster of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge"] The Verge claimed Squirtle is a best Pokémon of all time.[24] Ryan
Gilliam of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_(website)"] Polygon claimed that Squirtle is the best starter Pokémon which was always the roundest
one.[25] According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)"] Time magazine, Squirtle was considered one of the "more popular" in the original
 series.[7] Boys' Life named Squirtle "one of the five coolest Pokémon from Pokémon FireRed and
LeafGreen",  placing second on their list.[26] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Times-Dispatch"] Richmond Times-Dispatch editor Douglas Durden
commented that Squirtle was a "favourite Pokémon" of the series.[27] Author Patrick Drazen discussed the
anime incarnation and commented that Squirtle asserted its alpha male status by "wearing an even more
outrageous pair of sunglasses" than the other Squirtles in its gang.[28] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Express-News"] San Antonio Express-News editor
Susan Yerkes called Squirtle "disgustingly cute".[29] An editor for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN"] IGN called Squirtle "the best between
Bulbasaur and Charmander", citing how many Pokémon are disadvantageous to Squirtle.[8] IGN editor
"Pokémon of the Day Chick" preferred Squirtle as well, citing how it is the only one of the three that is
only one type when it reaches its final form. However, she commented that Squirtle seems "boring" due to
there being many pure Water types.[30] IGN stated "Leave it to Nintendo to have a cute turtle", further
calling it "cuter than the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_(franchise)"] Mario series [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koopa_Troopas"] Koopa Troopas".[31] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GamesRadar"] GamesRadar editor Brett Elston noted that
while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charizard"] Charizard and Bulbasaur get "big props" from Pokémon players, Squirtle appears to be "more
popular" from people who are not fans of the series, suggesting that its appearance may be a part of it.[32]
 GamesRadar editor Carolyn Gudmundson commented that Squirtle was the "coolest" of the three starting
Page 4
Pokémon in the anime.[33] Author Maria S. Jones called Squirtle "cute and cuddly".[34] IGN ranked it the
46th best Pokémon ever. An author noted that it was "instantly recognisable" to anyone who has been
"around an eight year-old at some point in the last 15 years."[35] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Informer"] Game Informer also included it in its list
of the best Pokémon at #03 (along with Charmander and Bulbasaur). Author O'Dell Harmon noted the
 choice between these three Pokémon as the "most important" one in the series' history.[36] Official
Nintendo Magazine's readers voted it as the second best Water-type Pokémon. Author Thomas East called
it "one of the cutest" and "one of the most popular."[37] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_Gamer"] Pocket Gamer listed and criticize Squirtle as the
worst Pokémon, and stated that Squirtle is just a turtle.[38] Steven Bogos of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Escapist_(magazine)"] The Escapist listed Squirtle as
40th of their favorite Pokémon, describing it as "adorably bad-ass."[39]
Squirtle was among eleven Pokémon chosen as Japan's mascots in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup"] 2014 FIFA World Cup.[40]
