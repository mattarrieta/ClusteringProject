Developed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Freak"] Game Freak
and published by

series began in Japan in

Pikachu was one of several different Pokémon designs conceived
Pikachu as depicted in promotional
artwork for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue"] Pokémon Red and Blue,
its first appearance 
 by Game Freak's character development team. Artist Atsuko
Nishida is credited as the main person behind Pikachu's
design,[6][7] which was later finalized by artist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Sugimori"] Ken Sugimori.[8][9]
(pikapika), a sparkling sound, and 
チュウチュウ 
ピカピカ According to series producer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Tajiri"] Satoshi Tajiri, the name is derived
from a combination of two Japanese onomatopoeia: 
(chūchū), a sound a mouse makes.[10] Despite its name's
origins, however, Nishida based Pikachu's original design, especially its cheeks, on squirrels.[11] Developer
 Junichi Masuda noted Pikachu's name as one of the most difficult to create, due to an effort to make it
appealing to both Japanese and American audiences.[12]
Standing 40 centimetres (1 ft 4 in) tall, Pikachu were the first "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_types"] Electric-type" Pokémon created, their design
intended to revolve around the concept of electricity.[13] They are creatures that have short, yellow fur with
brown markings covering their backs and parts of their lightning bolt-shaped tails. They have black-tipped,
pointed ears and red circular pouches on their cheeks, which can spark with electricity.[14] They attack
primarily by projecting electricity from their bodies at their targets.[15] Within the context of the franchise,
 Pikachu can transform, or "evolve," into a Raichu when exposed to a "Thunder Stone."[16] In Pokémon
 Gold and Silver, "Pichu" was introduced as an evolutionary predecessor to Pikachu.[17] In Pokémon
Diamond and Pearl, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"] gender differences were introduced; since those games, female Pikachu have an
indent at the end of their tails, giving the tail a heart-shaped appearance.
Initially, both Pikachu and fellow Pokémon [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clefairy"] Clefairy were chosen to be lead characters for the franchise
merchandising, with the latter as the primary mascot to make the early [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Pocket_Monsters"] comic book series more "engaging".
 The idea of Pikachu as the mascot of the animated series was suggested by the production company OLM,
Inc., which found that Pikachu was popular amongst schoolchildren and could appeal to both boys and
 girls,[18][10] as well as their mothers. Pikachu resembled a familiar, intimate pet, and yellow is a primary
color and easier for children to recognize from a distance. Additionally, the only other competing yellow
mascot at the time was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh"] Winnie-the-Pooh.[19] Pikachu was originally planned to have a second evolution
called Gorochu, which was intended to be the evolved form of Raichu.[20][21]
Pikachu's design has evolved from its once-pudgy body to having a slimmer waist, straighter spine, and
more defined face and neck; Sugimori has stated these design changes originated in the anime, making
Pikachu easier to animate, and were adopted to the games for consistency.[22] "Fat Pikachu" was revisited
in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Sword_and_Shield"] Pokémon Sword and Shield,  where Pikachu received a Gigantamax Form resembling its original
design.[23][24][25]

In video games
Pikachu has appeared in all [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(video_game_series)"] Pokémon video games, except Black and White, without having to trade.[26]
The game [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Yellow"] Pokémon Yellow features a Pikachu as the only available [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starter_Pok%C3%A9mon"] Starter Pokémon. Based on the
Pikachu from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_(anime)"] Pokémon anime, it refuses to stay in its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9_Ball"] Poké Ball, and instead follows the main character
around on screen. The trainer can speak to it and it displays different reactions depending on how it is
treated.[27][28] Pikachu also received the ability to learn new attacks such as the Electric-type attack,
Thunderbolt, which no other Pokémon could learn naturally.[29]
An event from April 1 to May 5, 2010, allowed players of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_HeartGold_and_SoulSilver"] Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver to access a
route on the Pokéwalker, which solely contained Pikachu which knew attacks that they were not normally
compatible with, Surf and Fly.[30] Both of these attacks can be used outside battles as travel aids. Seven
"Cap" forms of Pikachu, wearing caps belonging to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Ketchum"] Ash Ketchum across different seasons, were released
 across Pokémon Sun and Moon as well as their Ultra versions.[31] These games also released two Z-
Crystals exclusive to Pikachu: Pikanium Z, which upgrades Volt Tackle into Catastropika, and
Pikashunium Z,[32] which upgrades Thunderbolt into 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt when held by a Cap
form of Pikachu.[33]
 Pokémon Let's Go, which is based heavily on Yellow, has Pikachu as a starter in one of its two versions,
with the latter version using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eevee"] Eevee instead.[34] This starter Pikachu has access to several secret techniques
and exclusive moves.[35][36] Finally, in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Sword_and_Shield"] Pokémon Sword and Shield, Pikachu gained access to a special
Gigantamax form which grants it the ability to deal massive damage and paralyze opponents at the same
time.[37]
Aside from the main series, Pikachu stars in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_You,_Pikachu!"] Hey You, Pikachu! for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64"] Nintendo 64; the player interacts

through the various regions of the Pokémon universe. They are accompanied by a group of alternating
friends.
In the first episode, Ash Ketchum, a young boy from Pallet Town, turns 10 years old and acquires his first
Pokémon, a Pikachu, from Professor Oak. At first, Pikachu largely ignores Ash's requests, shocking him
frequently and refusing to be confined to the conventional method of Pokémon transportation, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9_Ball"] Poké Ball.
However, Ash puts himself in danger to defend Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow,[54] then rushes
Pikachu to a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Center"] Pokémon Center. Through Ash's actions, Pikachu warms up to Ash, although Pikachu still

order to win favor from their boss, Giovanni.[55]

Pikachu as the "public face of a phenomenon that has spread from Nintendo's fastest selling video game to

Edition voted Pikachu as the 20th-top video game character of all time.[121]

related media, saying: "it's hard not to be barraged by Pikachu's constant presence if you're a Pokémon fan,
and it sucks."[134]
