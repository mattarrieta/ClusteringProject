Venusaur ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈviːnəˌsɔːr/), known in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"] Japan as Fushigibana (
フシ
ギバナ), is a Grass/Poison-type [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon"] Pokémon species in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo"] Nintendo and
 Game Freak's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon"] Pokémon franchise. Created by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Sugimori"] Ken Sugimori,

 Green, which were localized outside Japan as Pokémon Red and
Blue.[1][2] Despite its English name and resemblance to the extinct
Pareiasaur, its design was confirmed by Ken Sugimori to be based 
 Kenta Miyake (TV
series episode #437)
on a frog.[3] Venusaur was originally named "Fushigibana" in Japanese, which is a combination of the
words fushigi and hana, which mean mystery and flower, respectively. Unlike its pre-evolutions, there is a
difference between male and female Venusaur. The female has a seed in the center of its flower, while the
male lacks it. Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon species "clever and descriptive names" related
to their appearance or features when translating the game for western audiences as a means to make the
characters more relatable to American children.[4] As a result, it was renamed Venusaur, which the gaming
website [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN"] IGN wrote was a combination of "venus" from the plant [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_flytrap"] venus flytrap and "saur" from dinosaur.[5]

Known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed"] Seed Pokémon, Venusaur is the final stage of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbasaur"] Bulbasaur [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_evolution"] evolution tree. The seed on the
back of Bulbasaur bloomed into a huge flower, vaguely resembling a Rafflesia. The flower constantly
draws in sunlight for nutrition, characterized by vivid colors and a soothing aroma, and power, which is
much more substantial in the summer.[6][7] They are always on the move to absorb more sunlight, though
they usually remain quiet and still while absorbing it.[8] After rain, the aroma is much stronger, which
attracts other Pokémon.
 Venusaur was given a Mega Evolution about one and a half years into the development of Pokémon X and
Y. Bulbasaur, along with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charmander"] Charmander and Squirtle, were added to the game in a significant role in order to
allow players to experience its Mega Evolution.[9] When [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Sword_and_Shield:_The_Isle_of_Armor"] Pokémon Sword and Shield: The Isle of Armor
released, Venusaur, along with Blastoise, was given a Gigantamax form. In this Gigantamax form, the
petals of the flower on Venusaur's back have grown, having a wider circumference compared to its regular
or Mega Evolved forms, and with this Gigantamax form, all Grass-type damaging moves Venusaur knows
will become the G-Max Move G-Max Vine Lash, which continuously damages non Grass-type Pokémon
for four turns.
Appearances
In the video games
Venusaur first appeared in the video games [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue"] Pokémon Red and Blue. It served as the mascot for both
 Pokémon LeafGreen and the Japanese exclusive version of Red and Blue titled Pocket Monsters Green. It
evolves from Ivysaur, which evolves from Bulbasaur, one of the three starting Pokémon available to
players in most of the above-mentioned games. It has since appeared in every main Pokémon title since.
 Outside of the main series, Venusaur appears in Pokémon Pinball, Pokémon Trozei!, the Pokémon Mystery
Dungeon titles, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Ranger"] Pokémon Ranger titles, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Rumble"] Pokémon Rumble and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9Park_Wii:_Pikachu%27s_Adventure"] PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure. In
 Super Smash Bros., it appears in the Saffron City stage and attacks anyone that comes within range of it. It
also appears in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_You,_Pikachu!"] Hey You, Pikachu!, where it lives on the Cobalt Coast, saying its name in an echoing voice.
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee"] Super Smash Bros. Melee, Venusaur appears as a Pokémon that can be summoned from a Poké Ball to
attack opponents, as well as a collectible trophy. In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros._Ultimate"] Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Venusaur appears as a
Spirit. If equipped, the fighter will be stronger, but also more vulnerable to fire. Venusaur is one of the
several Pokémon in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_X_and_Y"] Pokémon X and Y that are able to use the Mega Evolution mechanic, becoming Mega
Venusaur.[10]
Venusaur is also available in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Go"] Pokémon Go. In the first few hours of the gameplay tests in the United States,
Australia and New Zealand, Venusaur was the last Pokémon available to be captured.[11] It also appeared
in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokk%C3%A9n_Tournament"] Pokkén Tournament, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Pok%C3%A9mon_Snap"] New Pokémon Snap and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Unite"] Pokémon Unite, where it is available as a reward for
gaining battle experience.[12]
In other media
Venusaur has appeared several times in the anime. In Bulbasaur's Mysterious Garden, a wild one was
leading an evolution ceremony for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulbasaur"] Bulbasaur in Kanto. Another Venusaur was the ruler of a forest in
 Hoenn where grass Pokémon lived. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"] May also had a Bulbasaur that evolved into a Venusaur for Pokémon
contests, as it was done to avoid confusing her Bulbasaur with Ash's own Bulbasaur. Venusaur has also
been owned by Drake of the Orange Crew, an artist called Gan Gogh, Noland the Factory Head and
Spencer the Palace Maven of Hoenn's Battle Frontier, and a business man/guitarist named Jeremy. In the
 Pokémon Adventures manga, the character [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_(Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures)"] Red receives a Bulbasaur from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Oak"] Professor Oak, which he
nicknames Saur.[13] It ultimately evolves into an Ivysaur[14] and In Chapter 33, "The Winged Legends",
Page 3
Red's Ivysaur evolves into a Venusaur to team up with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_(Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures)"] Blue's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charizard"] Charizard and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"] Green's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blastoise"] Blastoise to defeat
 Sabrina's Zapmolcuno (a merged form of Zapdos, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moltres"] Moltres and Articuno) and destroy Team Rocket's
control over Saffron City, splitting the three birds in the process.[15] Venusaur is a piece in Pokémon Battle
Chess, with its moves resembling a rook in conventional chess.
Reception
Venusaur has received positive reception. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_(magazine)"] Complex's Elijah Watson commented, "most of us grew up" with
Venusaur.[16] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GamesRadar"] GamesRadar editor Brett Elston commented that Venusaur "sets the standard for evolutions" -
namely that a Pokémon will start off "cute", and then become an "unsightly beast".[17] He noted, however,
that while "ugly",  Venusaur is also "intimidating".[18] GamesRadar noted Venusaur as Bulbasaur's
"greatest drawback", due to its lack of charm.[19] GamesRadar's Carolyn Gudmundson called it one of her
"favourite" Pokémon due to it being "ugly" and resembling a cat. Another editor commented that the way
its teeth stick resembles the manga cliche of a cat design, while yet another editor commented that he liked
the way how Bulbasaur's flower bloomed as it grows into Ivysaur and then Venusaur.[20] Kevin Slackie of
 Paste listed Venusaur as 21st of the best Pokémon.[21] IGN's Pokémon Chick wrote that since Red and
Blue, the Pokémon Charizard had "slightly surpassed Venusaur in terms of popularity".[22] In a poll
conducted by IGN, it was voted as the "15th best" Pokémon; IGN staff felt that Venusaur paled in
comparison to Charizard and Blastoise due to them being more intimidating.[23] Author Daniel Bischoff
chose to not evolve Bulbasaur into Venusaur and stated that Venusaur "just looked kind of fat."[24] Series
artist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Sugimori"] Ken Sugimori noted that Venusaur, while one of his favorite Pokémon, was his least favourite
Pokémon to draw due to its complex design.[25] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Nintendo_Magazine"] Official Nintendo Magazine's Elizabeth Mo included it on
her list of Pokémon she wants to see given a Mega Evolution.[26] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destructoid"] Destructoid's Steven Hansen felt that
Venusaur's Mega Evolution looked "stupid."[27] An artist RJ Palmer of the film [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Pikachu_(film)"] Detective Pikachu made a
hyper-realistic Venusaur, it was too scary that Venusaur was only put on the background.[28] Ben Skipper
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Business_Times"] International Business Times praised the designs of Venosaur in Pokémon Green.[29]
