in Japan, is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon"] Pokémon species in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo"] Nintendo's and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Freak"] Game Freak's
 Pokémon franchise. Created by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atsuko_Nishida"] Atsuko Nishida,[1] Charmander
first appeared in the video games [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue"] Pokémon Red and Blue and
subsequent sequels, later appearing in various merchandise, spinoff

Charmander
 Pokémon series character
Charmander is one of three 'starter' Pokémon that can be selected
at the beginning of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue"] Pokémon Red and Blue, and their remakes,
 Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen. In the anime, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Ketchum"] Ash acquires a
Charmander early in the series, and it became one of his most used
Pokémon. In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures"] Pokémon Adventures manga, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures_protagonists#Blue"] Blue receives a
Charmander from his grandfather [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Oak"] Professor Oak. Since it appeared
in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon"] Pokémon series, Charmander has received generally positive
 reception. Charmander first appeared in episode 11 of Pokémon
Indigo League ("Charmander – The Stray Pokémon" (The Stray
Pokémon – Hitokage)). In the episode, Charmander is left by its
owner, Damian, and is rescued by Ash and Brock. When Damian
sees how powerful Charmander is, he calls Charmander back.
However, because of Damian's abuse, Charmander chooses to
follow the group that saved its life, and becomes Ash's Pokémon.
In the series, the narrator stated that if a Charmander's tail flame
goes out, it dies. Charmander is used by Ash throughout his
adventures and is seen in special episodes in the future.
Charmander evolves into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_generation_I_Pok%C3%A9mon"] Charmeleon at level 16, who then
evolves into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charizard"] Charizard at level 36, which was originally its last
form. Since the release of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_X_and_Y"] Pokémon X and Y, Charizard can mega
evolve into 2 different types of Mega Charizard, which are Mega
Charizard X or Mega Charizard Y, for the duration of a battle. This
gives it temporary upgraded stats and a major damage bonus.
 Charmander made the cut and in 2019 returned in Pokémon
Sword and Shield.

Design and characteristics
Charmander was designed as a fire Pokémon for the first generation of Pocket Monsters games Red and
Green (which were localized outside Japan as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue"] Pokémon Red and Blue) by Atsuko Nishida, who based its
design on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charizard"] Charizard in such a way that it was difficult to tell it would have evolved into the latter
Pokémon.[1] Originally called "Hitokage" in Japanese, Nintendo decided to give the various Pokémon
species "clever and descriptive names" related to their appearance or features when translating the game for
western audiences as a means to make the characters more relatable to American children.[2] As a result,
the species was renamed "Charmander", a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau"] portmanteau of "char", meaning burnt, and "salamander".[3]
Charmander are small, bipedal lizard-like Pokémon native to Kanto. They have blue eyes, orange skin,
three-clawed toes, yellow bellies, and a single yellow pad covering most of the bottom of each foot. While
the Pokémon Red and Green sprites made by Atsuko Nishida featured only three fingers on each hand, like
 Charmeleon and Charizard, the artwork drawn by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Sugimori"] Ken Sugimori for those games depicted Charmander as
having an additional thumb on each hand. Since [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Black_and_White"] Pokémon Black and White, a new updated artwork was
released in which Charmander has just three fingers on each hand. Said updated design has since been used
consistently in the anime, including the movies and specials like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Origins"] Pokémon Origins, as well as in official
artwork used in merchandise and in plushies, dolls and figurines, accompanying the artwork by Ken
Sugimori as well as the 3D CG models and the artwork derived from those that still feature the four-
fingered hand. Noticeably, the Charmander artwork made by Nishida for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game"] Trading Card Game in 2018
showed Charmander as having just three fingers on each hand.
The end of a Charmander's tail is alight with a flame, and the flame's size reflects both the physical health[4]
and the emotions of the individual.[5] When it rains, steam is said to spout from the tip of its tail.[6] If the
flame were to ever go out, the Charmander would die.[7] When Charmander receives enough [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point"] experience
from battles, it evolves into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charmeleon"] Charmeleon (at level 16 in the video games), and later Charizard. With the help
of the Mega Stone, it can further Mega Evolve into Mega Charizard X/Mega Charizard Y. The idea to
feature Charmander and the other Red and Blue starters in a significant role in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_X_and_Y"] Pokémon X and Y came
about a year and a half into the development of the games. The Mega Evolutions for the three Pokémon's
final forms were created, and the designers decided that they should give players an opportunity to find one
of these Pokémon in order to see their Mega Evolved form.[8]
Appearances
In the video games
Charmander is a starter Pokémon the player can choose from at the beginning of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue"] Pokémon Red and Blue,
and their remakes, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen"] Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen. Charmander and the other starters from Red and Blue
are replaced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikachu"] Pikachu in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Yellow"] Pokémon Yellow, the only starter available in it. Instead, they are each obtained
from certain NPCs.[9] In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_HeartGold_and_SoulSilver"] Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, as a reward from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Oak"] Professor Oak after
defeating the final boss, Red, the player can choose from Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. In
 Pokémon X and Y, players can also choose between Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle near the start of
 the game shortly after having chosen the games' new starter Pokémon.[10] It also appeared in Pokémon
 Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! and Pokémon
Page 3
 Sword and Shield. Outside of the main series, Charmander has appeared in Pokémon Go,[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Sword_and_Shield"] [11] Hey You,
 Pikachu!, Pokémon Snap, Pokémon Puzzle League, the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games, the Pokémon
Ranger games, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Pikachu_(video_game)"] Pokemon: Detective Pikachu, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9Park_Wii:_Pikachu%27s_Adventure"] PokéPark Wii: Pikachu's Adventure, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_UNITE"] Pokémon UNITE,[12]
 New Pokémon Snap,[13] and other Pokémon games.[9] A Pokémon stage in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros."] Super Smash Bros. called
"Saffron City" features an area where various Pokémon pop out to try to attack players; one such Pokémon
is a Charmander that sometimes uses Flamethrower.
In anime
In anime, Ash acquires a Charmander early in the series. Ash's Charmander originally belonged to a trainer
named Damian, who believed it was weak and cruelly abandoned it, telling it to stay on a rocky outcrop
until he "returned." The Pokémon was very loyal to its trainer and risked its life sitting in the rain, waiting
for a trainer who'd never come back to it. Ash, Brock, and Misty had to rush it to a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Center"] Pokémon Center to
keep it alive. Upon seeing Damian's true colors, Charmander joined Ash.[14] It was immediately one of
Ash's most used Pokémon, defeating such opponents as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koga_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"] Koga's Golbat, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erika_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"] Erika's Weepinbell, and helped
capture Ash's Primeape. Charmander evolved into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charmeleon"] Charmeleon after a battle against an army of Exeggutor.
His personality changed drastically, disobeying Ash and fighting only when and how he pleased.[15]
In an anime adaption of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mystery_Dungeon:_Blue_Rescue_Team_and_Red_Rescue_Team"] Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team,  a
Charmander and a female [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chikorita"] Chikorita work alongside a young boy who transformed into a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirtle"] Squirtle in
helping fellow Pokémon.
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_the_Movie:_I_Choose_You!"] Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You! Charmander's behavior and personality are different compared to
what was seen in the anime. In it, Charmander, when evolved into Charmeleon, leaps into Ash's arms for a
hug and subsequently he recognizes Ash's authority, even when battling his former trainer, Cross. When he
evolves into a Charizard, near the end of the film, he stays obedient to Ash and even saves Cross from the
attacks of his Lycanroc.[16]
In other media
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Electric_Tale_of_Pikachu"] the Electric Tale of Pikachu manga, the circumstances in which Ash captures a Charmander appear to be
different. While Damian appears, he was separated from his Charmander because he was injured, not
because he abandoned it. At the end of the chapter, the two reunite. Despite this difference, Ash is still seen
owning a Charmander, whose capture is not shown. Later in the manga, Ash's Charmander reappears as a
Charizard.
In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures"] Pokémon Adventures manga, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Adventures_protagonists#Blue"] Blue receives a Charmander from his grandfather [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Oak"] Professor Oak. The
blue team tried using it against [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mew_(Pok%C3%A9mon)"] Mew but failed and withdrew his Pokémon. It is later shown to have
evolved into a Charmeleon. then a Charizard. Later, in the Gold, Silver & Crystal chapter, Blue team
decides to trade his Charizard with Red team for a Gyarados. Nearing the end of the chapter, the Charizard
 is returned to him for a big battle. In the Pokémon Pocket Monsters manga series, Isamu Akai's rival Kai
Midorikawa, chose Charmander as his starter Pokémon. Kai's Charmander is mischievous and has a rivalry
with Isamu Akai's Clefairy.
In the online phenomenon known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitch_Plays_Pokemon"] Twitch Plays Pokemon, the stream chose Charmander as Red's starter
and named it "ABBBBBBK(", or "Abby" as it was commonly referred to.[17] Abby was vital in defeating
Brock and obtaining the Boulder Badge. Along its journey to Cerulean City, Abby evolved into a
 Charmeleon in the depths of Mt. Moon, securing it as Red's early-game muscle. Abby continued to prove
Page 4
itself by helping Red obtain the Cascade, Thunder, and Rainbow Badges. Unfortunately, during an
unfortunate visit Saffron City's Pokemon Center, Abby was released into the wild and NEVER seen
again.[18]
Charmander appeared in the background of the movie [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Detective_Pikachu"] Detective Pikachu.[19]
Reception
Since it appeared in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon"] Pokémon series, Charmander has received generally positive reception. It has
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game"] appeared in several pieces of merchandise, including figures, plush toys, and the Pokémon Trading Card
Game. It has been noted as a popular [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween"] Halloween costume for the year of 1999.[20] Also in 1999, it was
speculated by analysts that Pokémon species, in particular Charmander and others, would become sought-
after toys.[21]
 IGN readers ranked Charmander at #37 among the best Pokémon ever.[22] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Informer"] Game Informer's O'Dell
Harmon ranked Charmander - along with Bulbasaur and Squirtle - as the "third best" Pokémon. He noted
that the choice between the three was "one of the most important decisions to ever be made in Pokémon
history."[23] Lyra Hale of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mary_Sue"] The Mary Sue claimed that "it got absolutely wild when Charmander was a
healthy dinosaur."[24] GamesTM noted that Charmander was the "worst starting Pokémon" in Red and
Blue.[25] In the book Dragonlore: From the Archives of the Grey School of Wizardry, author Ash Dekirk
described Charmander as a "fire-breathing dragon".[26] Author Loredana Lipperini cited Charmander as a
"popular Pokémon", suggesting that its popularity comes from its fiery tail.[27] Author Mark Jacobson
found the transition from Charmander to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charizard"] Charizard to be "odd", questioning how a "baby" Pokémon can
grow into a "two-hundred-pound monster whose breath can melt boulders."[28] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GamesRadar%2B"] GamesRadar+ commented
that while Charmander seems "pitiful" due to its flame tail, which "burn more brightly depending on his
mood/health", it grows into the "cool-looking Charizard".[29] GamesRadar editor Brett Elston stated that
while it "lacks the nuances" of later similar starting Pokémon, it has "cutesy appeal" to it.[30] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Escapist_(magazine)"] The Escapist
editor John Funk described Charmander as "cute", using its evolution into Charizard as an example of "an
extreme evolutionary change" in the series.[31] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune"] Chicago Tribune editor Darryl E. Owens described
Charmander as "adorable".[32] San Antonio-Express News editor Susan Yerkes described Charmander as
"disgustingly cute".[33] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Ink"] Teen Ink editor Kathryn J. called Charmander her "favorite Pokémon".[34] Allegra
Frank of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_(website)"] Polygon said that Charmander is the best Pokémon of all time.[35] Michael Derosa of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Rant"] Screen Rant
 ranked Charmander as ninth of the most iconic Pokémon from Generation I.[36] Sam Loveridge of Digital
Spy claimed that Charmander is one of the best Pokémon starters, and further stated that not only is
Charmander an adorable starter Pokémon, he's also ridiculously powerful.[37]
Charmander was among eleven Pokémon chosen as Japan's mascots in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup"] 2014 FIFA World Cup.[38]
