Ariane 5
Ariane 5 is a European [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy-lift_launch_vehicle"] heavy-lift space launch vehicle developed and
operated by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arianespace"] Arianespace for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency"] European Space Agency (ESA).  It is
launched from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guiana_Space_Centre"] Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG) in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Guiana"] French Guiana. It has
 been used to deliver payloads into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) or low
Earth orbit (LEO).  The launch vehicle had a streak of 82 consecutive
successful launches between 9 April 2003 and 12 December 2017. Since
2014,[4] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_6"] Ariane 6, a direct successor system, is in development.[5] 
Ariane 5
 The system was designed as an expendable launch system by the Centre
national d'études spatiales (CNES), the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_France"] French government's space agency,
in close cooperation with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Germany"] Germany and other European partners.[6] Despite
not being a direct derivative of its predecessor launch vehicle program, it is
classified as part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_(rocket_family)"] Ariane rocket family. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_Defence_and_Space"] Airbus Defence and Space is
the prime contractor for the vehicles, leading a multi-country consortium of
other European contractors. ESA originally designed Ariane 5 to launch the
 Hermes spaceplane, and thus it is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-rating_certification"] rated for human space launches.
Since its first launch, Ariane 5 has been refined in successive versions: "G",
"G+", "GS", "ECA", and most recently, "ES". The system has a commonly
used dual-launch capability, where up to two large geostationary belt
 communication satellites can be mounted using a SYLDA (Système de
Lancement Double Ariane, "Ariane Double-Launch System") carrier system.
Up to three, somewhat smaller, main satellites are possible depending on size
using SPELTRA (Structure Porteuse Externe Lancement Triple Ariane,
"Ariane Triple-Launch External Carrier Structure"). Up to eight secondary
payloads, usually small experiment packages or minisatellites, can be carried
with an ASAP (Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads) platform.
After the launch of 15 August 2020, Arianespace had already signed the
contracts for the last eight Ariane 5 launches, left to launch before the
transition to the new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_6"] Ariane 6  launcher, according to Daniel
Neuenschwander, director of space transportation at the ESA.[7][5]

Vehicle description
Cryogenic main stage
Ariane 5's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenics"] cryogenic H173 main stage (H158
for Ariane 5G, G+, and GS) is called the
EPC (Étage Principal Cryotechnique —
Cryotechnic Main Stage).  It consists of a
5.4 m (18 ft) diameter by 30.5 m (100 ft) high
 tank with two compartments, one for liquid
oxygen and one for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen"] liquid hydrogen, and a
 Vulcain 2 engine at the base with a vacuum
thrust of 1,390 kN (310,000 lbf). The H173
EPC weighs about 189 t (417,000 lb),
including 175 t (386,000 lb) of propellant.[8]
After the main cryogenic stage runs out of
fuel, it re-enters the atmosphere for an ocean
splashdown.
 Vulcain engine  Solid boosters
Attached to the sides are two P241 (P238 for
Ariane 5G and G+) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_rocket_booster"] solid rocket boosters (SRBs or EAPs from the French
Étages d'Accélération à Poudre), each weighing about 277 t (611,000 lb) full
and delivering a thrust of about 7,080 kN (1,590,000 lbf). They are fueled by
a mix of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_perchlorate"] ammonium perchlorate (68%) and aluminium fuel (18%) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl-terminated_polybutadiene"] HTPB
(14%). They each burn for 130 seconds before being dropped into the ocean.
The SRBs are usually allowed to sink to the bottom of the ocean, but, like the
 Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters, they can be recovered with parachutes,
and this has occasionally been done for post-flight analysis. Unlike Space
Shuttle SRBs, Ariane 5 boosters are not reused. The most recent attempt was
for the first Ariane 5 ECA mission in 2009. One of the two boosters was
successfully recovered and returned to the Guiana Space Center for
analysis.[9] Prior to that mission, the last such recovery and testing was done
in 2003.
The French [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M51_(missile)"] M51 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine-launched_ballistic_missile"] submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) shares a
substantial amount of technology with these boosters.

the government could get to it.[10]
Second stage 
The second stage is on top of the main stage
and below the payload. The original Ariane
— Ariane 5G — used the EPS (Étage à
Propergols Stockables — Storable Propellant
Stage),  which was fueled by
 monomethylhydrazine (MMH) and nitrogen
tetroxide, containing 10,000 kg (22,000 lb) of
 storable propellant. The EPS was
subsequently improved for use on the Ariane
5G+, GS, and ES.
The EPS upper stage is capable of multiple
ignitions, first demonstrated during flight V26
EPS Upper Stage used on
Ariane 5ES 
which was launched on 5 October 2007. This
was purely to test the engine, and occurred
after the payloads had been deployed. The
first operational use of restart capability as
part of a mission came on 9 March 2008, when two burns were made to
deploy the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Transfer_Vehicle"] Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) into a circular parking
orbit, followed by a third burn after ATV deployment to de-orbit the stage.
This procedure was repeated for all subsequent ATV flights.
Ariane 5ECA uses the ESC (Étage Supérieur Cryotechnique — Cryogenic
Upper Stage), which is fueled by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The
ESC uses the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM7B"] HM7B engine previously used in the Ariane 4 third stage. The
propellent load of 14.7 tonne allows the engine to burn for 945 seconds while
providing 6.5 tonne of thrust, The ESC provides roll control during powered
flight and full attitude control during payload separation using hydrogen gas
thrusters. Oxygen gas thrusters allow longitudinal acceleration after engine
cutoff. The flight assembly includes the Vehicle Equipment Bay, with flight
electronics for the entire rocket, and the payload interface and structural
support.[11][12]
Fairing
The payload and all upper stages are covered at launch by a fairing for
aerodynamic stability and protection from heating during supersonic flight
and acoustic loads. It is jettisoned once sufficient altitude has been reached,
typically above 100 km (62 mi). It is made by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RUAG_Space"] Ruag Space and since flight
VA-238 it is composed of 4 panels.[13]

Variant  Description
The original version is dubbed Ariane 5G (Generic) and had a
launch mass of 737 t (1,625,000 lb). Its payload capability to
G  geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) was 6,900 kg (15,200 lb) for a
single satellite or 6,100 kg (13,400 lb) for dual launches. It flew 17
times with one failure and two partial failures.[14]
The Ariane 5G+ had an improved EPS second stage, with a GTO
G+  capacity of 7,100 kg (15,700 lb) for a single payload or 6,300 kg
(13,900 lb) for two. It flew three times in 2004, with no failures.[15]
At the time of the failure of the first Ariane 5ECA flight in 2002, all
Ariane 5 launchers in production were ECA versions. Some of the
ECA cores were modified to use the original Vulcain engine and
tank volumes while the failure was investigated; these vehicles
were designated Ariane 5GS. The GS used the improved EAP
GS 
boosters of the ECA variant and the improved EPS of the G+
variant, but the increased mass of the modified ECA core
compared to the G and G+ core resulted in slightly reduced
payload capacity.[16] Ariane 5GS could carry a single payload of
6,600 kg (14,600 lb) or a dual payload of 5,800 kg (12,800 lb) to
GTO. The Ariane 5GS flew 6 times from 2005 to 2009 with no
failures.[17]
ECA 
The Ariane 5ECA (Evolution Cryotechnique type A), first
successfully flown in 2005, uses an improved Vulcain 2 first-stage
engine with a longer, more efficient nozzle with a more efficient flow
cycle and denser propellant ratio. The new ratio required length
modifications to the first-stage tanks. The EPS second stage was
replaced by the ESC-A (Etage Supérieur Cryogénique-A), which
 has a dry weight of 4,540 kg (10,010 lb) and is powered by an HM-
7B engine burning 14,900 kg (32,800 lb) of cryogenic propellant.
The ESC-A uses the liquid oxygen tank and lower structure from
the Ariane 4's H10 third stage, mated to a new liquid hydrogen
tank. Additionally, the EAP booster casings were lightened with
new welds and carry more propellant. The Ariane 5ECA started with
a GTO launch capacity of 9,100 kg (20,100 lb) for dual payloads or
9,600 kg (21,200 lb) for a single payload.[18] Later batches: PB+
and PC, increased the max payload to GTO to 11,115 kg
(24,504 lb).[3]
The Ariane 5ES (Evolution Storable) has an estimated LEO launch
capacity of 21,000 kg (46,000 lb). It includes all the performance
improvements of Ariane 5ECA core and boosters but replaces the
ESC-A second stage with the restartable EPS used on Ariane 5GS
ES  variants. It was used to launch the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Transfer_Vehicle"] Automated Transfer Vehicle
(ATV) into a 260 km (160 mi) circular low Earth orbit inclined at
 51.6° and has been used 3 times to launch 4 Galileo navigation
satellites at a time directly into their operational orbit.[2] The Ariane
5ES flew 8 times from 2008 to 2018 with no failures.
ME
(cancelled) 
The Ariane 5ME (Mid-life Evolution) was under development until
the end of 2014. The last ESA ministerial council of December
2014 has cut further funding for Ariane 5ME in favour of developing
Ariane 6. Last activities for Ariane 5ME were completed at the end
of 2015. Activities on development of the VINCI upper stage were
transferred to Ariane 6.

The heavier satellite is launched in the upper position on a typical dual-
satellite Ariane 5 launch and is priced higher than the lower satellite,[20] on
the order of €90 million as of 2013.[21][22]
Total launch price of an Ariane 5 – which can transport up to two satellites to
space, one in the "upper" and one in the "lower" positions – was around
€150 million as of January 2015.[22]
Cancelled plans for future developments
Ariane 5 ME
The Ariane 5 ME (Mid-life Evolution) was in development into early 2015,
and was seen as a stopgap between Ariane 5ECA/Ariane 5ES and the new
 Ariane 6. With first flight planned for 2018, it would have become ESA's
principal launcher until the arrival of the new Ariane 6 version. ESA halted
funding for the development of Ariane 5ME in late 2014 to prioritize
development of Ariane 6.[23]
The Ariane 5ME was to use a new upper stage, with increased propellant
volume, powered by the new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinci_(rocket_engine)"] Vinci engine. Unlike the HM-7B engine, it was
to be able to restart several times, allowing for complex orbital maneuvers
such as insertion of two satellites into different orbits, direct insertion into
geosynchronous orbit, planetary exploration missions, and guaranteed upper
stage deorbiting or insertion into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_orbit"] graveyard orbit.[24][25] The launcher was
also to include a lengthened fairing up to 20 m (66 ft) and a new dual launch
system to accommodate larger satellites. Compared to an Ariane 5ECA
model, the payload to GTO was to increase by 15% to 11,500 kg (25,400 lb)
and the cost-per-kilogram of each launch is projected to decline by 20%.[24]
Development
Originally known as the Ariane 5ECB, Ariane 5ME was to have its first
flight in 2006. However, the failure of the first ECA flight in 2002, combined
with a deteriorating satellite industry, caused ESA to cancel development in
2003.[26] Development of the Vinci engine continued, though at a lower
pace. The ESA Council of Ministers agreed to fund development of the new
upper stage in November 2008.[27]
In 2009, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EADS_Astrium"] EADS Astrium was awarded a €200 million contract,[28] and on 10
April 2012 received another €112 million contract to continue development
of the Ariane 5ME [29] with total development effort expected to cost €1
billion.[30]
On 21 November 2012, ESA agreed to continue with the Ariane 5ME to
meet the challenge of lower priced competitors. It was agreed the Vinci upper
stage would also be used as the second stage of a new Ariane 6, and further
commonality would be sought.[25] Ariane 5ME qualification flight was
scheduled for mid-2018, followed by gradual introduction into service.[24]
On 2 December 2014, ESA decided to stop funding the development of
Ariane 5ME and instead focus on Ariane 6, which was expected to have a
lower cost per launch and allow more flexibility in the payloads (using two or
four P120C solid boosters depending on total payload mass).[23]

Solid propellant stage
Work on the Ariane 5 EAP motors has been continued in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega_(launcher)"] Vega
programme. The Vega 1st stage engine – the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P80_(stage)"] P80 engine – is a shorter
derivation of the EAP.[31] The P80 booster casing is made of filament wound
graphite epoxy, much lighter than the current stainless steel casing. A new
composite steerable nozzle has been developed while new thermal insulation
material and a narrower throat improve the expansion ratio and subsequently
the overall performance. Additionally, the nozzle now has electromechanical
actuators which have replaced the heavier hydraulic ones used for thrust
vector control.
These developments will probably later make their way back into the Ariane
programme.[25][32] The incorporation of the ESC-B with the improvements
to the solid motor casing and an uprated Vulcain engine would deliver
27,000 kg (60,000 lb) to LEO. This would be developed for any lunar
missions but the performance of such a design may not be possible if the
higher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Q"] Max-Q for the launch of this launch vehicle poses a constraint on the
mass delivered to orbit.[33]

The design brief of the next generation launch vehicle [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_6"] Ariane 6 called for a
lower-cost and smaller launch vehicle capable of launching a single satellite of
up to 6,500 kg (14,300 lb) to GTO.[34] However, after several permutations
the finalized design was nearly identical in performance to the Ariane 5,[35]
focusing instead on lowering fabrication costs and launch prices.
Initially development of Ariane 6 was projected to cost €3.6 billion.[36] In
2017, the ESA set July 16, 2020 as the deadline for the first flight.[37] In
2021, its first test launch was set in 2022.[38]As of March 2014, Ariane 6 was
projected to be launched for about €70 million per flight or about half of the
Ariane 5 current price.[34]
Notable launches
Ariane 5's first test flight ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_5_Flight_501"] Ariane 5 Flight 501) on 4 June 1996 failed, with the
rocket self-destructing 37 seconds after launch because of a malfunction in the
control software.[39] A data conversion from 64-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit"] bit [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point"] floating point value to 16-
bit [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signedness"] signed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer"] integer value to be stored in a variable representing horizontal bias
caused a processor trap (operand error)[40] because the floating point value
was too large to be represented by a 16-bit signed integer. The software had
been written for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_4"] Ariane 4 where efficiency considerations (the computer
running the software had an 80% maximum workload requirement[40]) led to
four variables being protected with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling"] handler while three others, including the
horizontal bias variable, were left unprotected because it was thought that they
were "physically limited or that there was a large margin of safety".[40] The
software, written in Ada, was included in the Ariane 5 through the reuse of an
entire Ariane 4 subsystem despite the fact that the particular software
containing the bug, which was just a part of the subsystem, was not required
by the Ariane 5 because it has a different preparation sequence than the
Ariane 4.[40]

The second test flight (L502, on 30 October 1997) was a partial failure. The Vulcain nozzle caused a roll problem,
leading to premature shutdown of the core stage. The upper stage operated successfully, but it could not reach the
intended orbit. A subsequent test flight (L503, on 21 October 1998) proved successful and the first commercial launch
(L504) occurred on 10 December 1999 with the launch of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMM-Newton"] XMM-Newton X-ray observatory satellite.
Another partial failure occurred on 12 July 2001, with the delivery of two satellites into an incorrect orbit, at only half
the height of the intended GTO. The ESA [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_(satellite)"] Artemis [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_satellite"] telecommunications satellite was able to reach its intended orbit on
31 January 2003, through the use of its experimental [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_propulsion"] ion propulsion system.
The next launch did not occur until 1 March 2002, when the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envisat"] Envisat [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_satellite"] environmental satellite successfully reached an
orbit of 800 km (500 mi) above the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"] Earth in the 11th launch. At 8,111 kg (17,882 lb), it was the heaviest single
payload until the launch of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne_ATV"] first ATV on 9 March 2008, at 19,360 kg (42,680 lb).
The first launch of the ECA variant on 11 December 2002 ended in failure when a main booster problem caused the
rocket to veer off-course, forcing its self-destruction three minutes into the flight. Its payload of two communications
satellites ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STENTOR_(satellite)"] STENTOR and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Bird_7"] Hot Bird 7), valued at about €630 million, was lost in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean"] Atlantic Ocean. The fault was
determined to have been caused by a leak in coolant pipes allowing the nozzle to overheat. After this failure,
 Arianespace SA delayed the expected January 2003 launch for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_space_probe"] Rosetta mission to 26 February 2004, but this was
again delayed to early March 2004 due to a minor fault in the foam that protects the cryogenic tanks on the Ariane 5.
As of June 2017, the failure of the first ECA launch was the last failure of an Ariane 5; since then, 82 consecutive
 launches have been successful, from April 2003 with the launch of INSAT-3A and Galaxy 12 satellites,[41] to flight
240 in December 2017.
 On 27 September 2003, the last Ariane 5G boosted three satellites (including the first European lunar probe, SMART-
1), in Flight 162. On 18 July 2004, an Ariane 5G+ boosted what was at the time the heaviest telecommunication
satellite ever, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anik_(satellite)"] Anik F2, weighing almost 6,000 kg (13,000 lb).
The first successful launch of the Ariane 5ECA took place on 12 February 2005. The payload consisted of the
 XTAR-EUR military communications satellite, a 'SLOSHSAT' small scientific satellite and a MaqSat B2 payload
 simulator. The launch had been scheduled for October 2004, but additional testing and a military launch (of a Helios
2A observation satellite) delayed the attempt.
On 11 August 2005, the first Ariane 5GS (featuring the Ariane 5ECA's improved solid motors) boosted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaicom_4"] Thaicom 4,
the heaviest telecommunications satellite to date at 6,505 kg (14,341 lb),[42] into orbit.
On 16 November 2005, the third Ariane 5ECA launch (the second successful ECA launch) took place. It carried a
dual payload consisting of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceway-2"] Spaceway F2 for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirecTV"] DirecTV and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telkom-2"] Telkom-2 for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telkom_Indonesia"] PT Telekomunikasi of Indonesia. This was
the launch vehicle's heaviest dual payload to date, at more than 8,000 kg (18,000 lb).
On 27 May 2006, an Ariane 5ECA launch vehicle set a new commercial payload lifting record of 8,200 kg
(18,100 lb). The dual-payload consisted of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaicom_5"] Thaicom 5 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutelsat_113_West_A"] Satmex 6 satellites.[43]
On 4 May 2007, the Ariane 5ECA set another new commercial record, lifting into transfer orbit the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astra_1L"] Astra 1L and
 Galaxy 17 communication satellites with a combined weight of 8,600 kg (19,000 lb), and a total payload weight of
 9,400 kg (20,700 lb).[44] This record was again broken by another Ariane 5ECA, launching the Skynet 5B and Star
One C1 satellites, on 11 November 2007. The total payload weight for this launch was of 9,535 kg (21,021 lb).[45]
On 9 March 2008, the first Ariane 5ES-ATV was launched to deliver the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Transfer_Vehicle"] ATV called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne_ATV"] Jules Verne to the
 International Space Station (ISS). The ATV was the heaviest payload ever launched by a European launch vehicle,
providing supplies to the space station with necessary propellant, water, air and dry cargo. This was the first
operational Ariane mission which involved an engine restart in the upper stage. The ES-ATV Aestus EPS upper stage
was restartable while the ECA HM7-B engine was not.
On 1 July 2009, an Ariane 5ECA launched [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TerreStar-1"] TerreStar-1 (now EchoStar T1), which was then, at 6,910 kg (15,230 lb),
the largest and most massive commercial telecommunication satellite ever built at that time[46] until being overtaken
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstar_19V"] Telstar 19 Vantage, at 7,080 kg (15,610 lb), launched aboard [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9"] Falcon 9. The satellite was launched into a lower-
energy orbit than a usual GTO, with its initial apogee at roughly 17,900 km (11,100 mi).[47]
Page 8
 On 28 October 2010, an Ariane 5ECA launched Eutelsat's W3B (part of its W Series of satellites) and Broadcasting
Satellite System Corporation (B-SAT)'s [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSAT-3b"] BSAT-3b satellites into orbit. But the W3B satellite failed to operate shortly
after the successful launch and was written off as a total loss due to an oxidizer leak in the satellite's main propulsion
system.[48] The BSAT-3b satellite, however, is operating normally.[49]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_flight_VA253"] VA253 launch on 15 August 2020 introduced two small changes that increased lift capacity by about 85 kg
(187 lb); these were a lighter avionics and guidance-equipment bay, and modified pressure vents on the payload
fairing, which were required for the subsequent launch of the James Webb Space Telescope. It also debuted a location
system using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_(satellite_navigation)"] Galileo navigation satellites.[50]
On 25 December 2021, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariane_flight_VA256"] VA256 launched the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope"] James Webb Space Telescope towards a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#L2_point"] Sun–Earth L2 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_orbit"] halo orbit.[51]
The precision of trajectory following launch led to fuel savings credited with potentially doubling the lifetime of the
telescope by leaving more [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine#Rocket_fuel"] hydrazine propellant on-board for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_station-keeping#Lagrange_points"] station-keeping than was expected.[51][52] According to
Rudiger Albat, the program manager for Ariane 5, efforts had been made to select components for this flight that had
performed especially well during pre-flight testing, including "one of the best Vulcain engines that we've ever
built."[52]
GTO payload weight records
 On 22 April 2011, the Ariane 5ECA flight VA-201 broke a commercial record, lifting Yahsat 1A and Intelsat New
Dawn with a total payload weight of 10,064 kg (22,187 lb) to transfer orbit.[53] This record was later broken again
during the launch of Ariane 5ECA flight VA-208 on 2 August 2012, lifting a total of 10,182 kg (22,447 lb) into the
planned geosynchronous transfer orbit,[54] which was broken again 6 months later on flight VA-212 with 10,317 kg
(22,745 lb) sent towards geosynchronous transfer orbit.[55] In June 2016, the GTO record was raised to 10,730 kg
(23,660 lb),[56] on the first rocket in history that carried a satellite dedicated to financial institutions.[57] The payload
 record was pushed a further 5 kg (11 lb), up to 10,735 kg (23,667 lb) on 24 August 2016 with the launch of Intelsat
33e and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelsat_36"] Intelsat 36.[58] On 1 June 2017, the payload record was broken again to 10,865 kg (23,953 lb) carrying
 ViaSat-2 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutelsat"] Eutelsat-172B.[59] In 2021 VA-255 put 11,210 kg into GTO.
VA241 anomaly
On 25 January 2018, an Ariane 5ECA launched [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES-14"] SES-14 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Yah_Satellite_Communications"] Al Yah 3 satellites. About 9 minutes and 28 seconds
after launch, a telemetry loss occurred between the launch vehicle and the ground controllers. It was later confirmed,
about 1 hour and 20 minutes after launch, that both satellites were successfully separated from the upper stage and
were in contact with their respective ground controllers,[60] but that their orbital inclinations were incorrect as the
guidance systems might have been compromised. Therefore, both satellites conducted orbital procedures, extending
commissioning time.[61] SES-14 needed about 8 weeks longer than planned commissioning time, meaning that entry
into service was reported early September instead of July.[62] Nevertheless, SES-14 is still expected to be able to meet
the designed lifetime. This satellite was originally to be launched with more propellant reserve on a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9"] Falcon 9 launch
vehicle since the Falcon 9, in this specific case, was intended to deploy this satellite into a high inclination orbit that
would require more work from the satellite to reach its final geostationary orbit.[63] The Al Yah 3 was also confirmed
healthy after more than 12 hours without further statement, and like SES-14, Al Yah 3's maneuvering plan was also
revised to still fulfill the original mission.[64] As of 16 February 2018, Al Yah 3 was approaching the intended
geostationary orbit, after series of recovery maneuvers had been performed.[65] The investigation showed that invalid
inertial units' azimuth value had sent the vehicle 17° off course but to the intended altitude, they had been programmed
for the standard geostationary transfer orbit of 90° when the payloads were intended to be 70° for this
supersynchronous transfer orbit mission, 20° off norme.[66] This mission anomaly marked the end of 82nd
consecutive success streak since 2003.[67]
