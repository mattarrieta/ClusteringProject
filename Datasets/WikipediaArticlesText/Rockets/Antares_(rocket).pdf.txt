Antares (rocket)
Antares ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ænˈtɑːriːz/), known during early development as Taurus II, is an
 expendable launch system developed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_Sciences_Corporation"] Orbital Sciences Corporation (now
part of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_Grumman"] Northrop Grumman) and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzhnoye_Design_Bureau"] Yuzhnoye Design Bureau to launch the
 Cygnus spacecraft to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station"] International Space Station as part of NASA's COTS
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Resupply_Services"] CRS programs. Able to launch payloads heavier than 8,000 kg
(18,000 lb) into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit"] low Earth orbit, Antares is currently the largest rocket
 operated by Northrop Grumman. Antares launches from the Mid-Atlantic
Regional Spaceport and made its inaugural flight on April 21, 2013.[12] 
Antares
 NASA awarded Orbital a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Orbital_Transportation_Services"] Commercial Orbital Transportation Services
(COTS) Space Act Agreement (SAA) in 2008 to demonstrate delivery of
cargo to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station"] International Space Station. For these COTS missions Orbital
intends to use Antares to launch its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_spacecraft"] Cygnus spacecraft. In addition, Antares
will compete for small-to-medium missions.[13] Originally designated the
 Taurus II, Orbital Sciences renamed the vehicle Antares, after the star of the
same name,[14] on December 12, 2011.
 Out of 16 total launches, Antares has suffered one failure. During the fifth
launch on October 28, 2014, the rocket failed catastrophically, and the vehicle
and payload were destroyed.[15] The rocket's first-stage engines were
identified as the cause for the failure. A different engine was chosen for
subsequent launches, and the rocket had a successful return to flight on
October 17, 2016.
The 2022 military attack on Ukraine by Russia is likely to have an impact on
the future of the rocket.[16]

Development
The NASA COTS award was for US$171 million and Orbital Sciences
expected to invest an additional $150 million, split between $130 million for
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Resupply_Service"] the booster and $20 million for the spacecraft.[17] A Commercial Resupply
Service contract of $1.9 billion for eight flights was awarded in 2008.[18] As
of April 2012, development costs were estimated at $472 million.[2]
In June 2008, it was announced that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Regional_Spaceport"] Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport,
formerly part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallops_Flight_Facility"] Wallops Flight Facility, in Virginia, would be the primary
launch site for the rocket.[19] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Regional_Spaceport_Launch_Pad_0"] Launch pad 0A (LP-0A), previously used for the
failed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conestoga_(rocket)"] Conestoga rocket, would be modified to handle Antares.[20] Wallops
allows launches which reach the International Space Station's orbit as
effectively as those from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral"] Cape Canaveral, Florida, while being less
crowded.[17][21] The first Antares flight launched a  Cygnus mass
simulator.[22]
On December 10, 2009, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliant_Techsystems_Inc."] Alliant Techsystems Inc. (ATK) test-fired their Castor
30 motor for use on the second stage of the Antares rocket.[23] In March
2010, Orbital Sciences and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerojet"] Aerojet completed test firings of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJ-26"] AJ-26
engines. [24] On February 22, 2013, a hot fire test was successfully performed,
the entire first stage being erected on the pad and held down while the engines
fired for 29 seconds.[22]

The Antares 100-series first stage was powered by two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerojet"] Aerojet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NK-33#Antares"] AJ26 engines.
These began as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznetsov_Design_Bureau"] Kuznetsov [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NK-33"] NK-33 engines built in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"] Soviet Union in the late
1960s and early 1970s, 43 of which were purchased by Aerojet in the 1990s.
Twenty of these were refurbished into AJ26 engines for Antares.[26]
Modifications included equipping the engines for gimballing, adding US
electronics, and qualifying the engines to fire for twice as long as designed
and to operate at 108% of their original thrust.[4][24] Together they produced
3,265 kilonewtons (734,000 lbf) of thrust at sea level and 3,630 kN
(816,100 lbf) in vacuum.[9]
 Following the catastrophic failure of an AJ26 during testing at Stennis Space
Center in May 2014 and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_CRS_Orb-3"] Orb-3 launch failure in October 2014, likely
caused by an engine turbopump,[27] the Antares 100-series was retired.
Antares 200 series
Because of concerns over corrosion, aging, and the limited supply of AJ26
 engines, Orbital had selected new first stage engines[24][28] to bid on a second
major long-term contract for cargo resupply of the ISS. After the loss of the
Antares rocket in October 2014, Orbital Sciences announced that the Russian
RD-181—a modified version of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RD-191"] RD-191—would replace the AJ-26 on
the Antares 200-series.[29][30] The first flight of the Antares 230 configuration
using the RD-181 happened on October 17, 2016, carrying the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_OA-5"] Cygnus OA-5
cargo to the ISS.
The Antares 200 and 200+ first stages are powered by two RD-181 engines,
which provide 440 kilonewtons (100,000 lbf) more thrust than the dual AJ26
engines used on the Antares 100. Orbital adapted the existing core stage to
accommodate the increased performance in the 200 Series, allowing Antares
to deliver up to 6,500 kg (14,300 lb) to low Earth orbit.[8] The surplus
performance of the Antares 200-series will allow Orbital to fulfill its ISS
resupply contract in only four additional flights, rather than the five that would
have been required with the Antares 100-series.[31][32][33]
While the 200 series adapted the originally ordered 100 Series stages
([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzhnoye_Design_Office"] Yuzhnoye SDO / Yuzhmash, Zenit derived),[34] it requires under-throttling
the RD-181 engines, which reduces performance.[32]
The Antares was upgraded to the Antares 230+ for the NASA Commercial
Resupply Services 2 contract. NG-12, launched November 2, 2019, was the
first NASA CRS-2 mission to ISS using the 230+ upgrades. The most
significant upgrades were structural changes to the intertank bay (between the
LO2 
and RP-1 tanks) and the forward bay (forward of the LO2
). Additionally,
the company is working on trajectory improvements via a "load-release
autopilot" that will provide greater mass to orbit capability.[35]
Second stage
The second stage is an Orbital ATK [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_(rocket_stage)"] Castor 30-series [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-fuel_rocket"] solid-fuel rocket,
developed as a derivative of the Castor 120 solid motor used as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur-C"] Minotaur-C's
first stage.[36] The first two flights of Antares used a Castor 30A, which was
replaced by the enhanced Castor 30B for subsequent flights. The Castor 30B
produces 293.4 kN (65,960 lbf) average and 395.7 kN (88,960 lbf) maximum

performance, the larger Castor 30XL is available[34] and will be used on ISS
resupply flights to allow Antares to carry the Enhanced Cygnus.[9][37][38]
The Castor 30XL upper stage for Antares 230+ is being optimized for the
CRS-2 contract. The initial design of the Castor 30XL was conservatively
built, and after gaining flight experience it was determined that the structural
component of the motor case could be lightened.[35]

Third stage
Antares offers three optional third stages: the Bi-Propellant Third Stage (BTS), a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_48"] Star 48-based third stage and an
 Orion 38 motor. BTS is derived from Orbital Sciences' GEOStar [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_bus"] spacecraft bus and uses [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_tetroxide"] nitrogen tetroxide and
 hydrazine for propellant; it is intended to precisely place payloads into their final orbits.[7] The Star 48-based stage uses
a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_48"] Star 48BV solid rocket motor and would be used for higher energy orbits.[7] The Orion 38 is used on the Minotaur
and Pegasus rockets as an upper stage.[39]
Fairing
 The 3.9-meter (13 ft) diameter, 9.9-meter (32 ft) high fairing is manufactured by Northrop Grumman of Iuka,
Mississippi, which also builds other composite structures for the vehicle, including the combined fairing adapter,
dodecagon, motor cone, and interstage.[40]
NASA Commercial Resupply Services-2 :
Enhancements
On January 14, 2016, NASA awarded three cargo contracts via CRS-2.
Orbital ATK's Cygnus was one of these contracts.[41]
According to Mark Pieczynski, Orbital ATK Vice President, Flight Systems
Group, "A further improved version [of Antares for CRS-2 contract] is in  Rear exhaust section of the rocket
development which will include: Stage 1 core updates including structural
reinforcements and optimization to accommodate increased loads. (Also)
certain refinements to the RD-181 engines and CASTOR 30XL motor; and Payload accommodations improvements
including a 'pop-top' feature incorporated in the fairing to allow late Cygnus cargo load and optimized fairing adapter
structure".
Previously, it was understood that these planned upgrades from the Antares 230 series would create a vehicle known as
the Antares 300 series. However, when asked specifically about Antares 300 series development, Mr. Pieczynski stated
that Orbital ATK has "not determined to call the upgrades, we are working on, a 300 series. This is still TBD".[42]
In May 2018, the Antares program manager Kurt Eberly indicated that the upgrades will be referred to as Antares
230+.[35]
Configurations and numbering
 The first two test flights used a Castor 30A second stage. All subsequent flights will use either a Castor 30B or Castor
30XL. The rocket's configuration is indicated by a three-digit number and a possible "+" suffix, the first number
representing the first stage, the second the type of second stage, and the third the type of third stage.[37] A + sign added
as suffix (fourth position) signifies performance upgrades to the Antares 230 variant.

Antares A-ONE
Originally scheduled for 2012, the first Antares launch, designated A-ONE[43] was conducted on April 21, 2013,[44]
carrying the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antares_A-ONE#Payloads"] Cygnus Mass Simulator (a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_(spaceflight)"] boilerplate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(spacecraft)"] Cygnus spacecraft) and four [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat"] CubeSats contracted by Spaceflight
Incorporated: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dove_1"] Dove 1 for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_Labs"] Cosmogia Incorporated (now Planet Labs) and three [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhoneSat"] PhoneSat satellites – Alexander,[45]
 Graham and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_(satellite)"] Bell for NASA.[46]
Prior to the launch, a 27-second test firing of the rocket's AJ26 engines was conducted successfully on February 22,
2013, following an attempt on February 13 which was abandoned before ignition.[22]
A-ONE used the Antares 110 configuration, with a Castor 30A second stage and no third stage. The launch took place
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Regional_Spaceport_Launch_Pad_0"] Pad 0A of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Regional_Spaceport"] Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallops_Island"] Wallops Island, Virginia. LP-0A was a former [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conestoga_(rocket)"] Conestoga
launch complex which had only been used once before, in 1995, for the Conestoga's only orbital launch attempt.[11]
Antares became the largest — and first — liquid-fuelled rocket to fly from Wallops Island, as well as the largest rocket
launched by Orbital Sciences.[43]
The first attempt to launch the rocket, on April 17, 2013, was [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scrub#Verb"] scrubbed after an umbilical detached from the rocket's
second stage, and a second attempt on April 20 was scrubbed due to high altitude winds.[47] At the third attempt on
April 21, the rocket lifted off at the beginning of its launch window. The launch window for all three attempts was
three hours beginning at 21:00 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time"] UTC (17:00 EDT), shortening to two hours at the start of the terminal count, and ten
minutes later in the count.[11][48]
Cygnus CRS Orb-3
On October 28, 2014, the attempted launch of an Antares carrying a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(spacecraft)"] Cygnus cargo spacecraft on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_CRS_Orb-3"] Orb-3 resupply
mission failed catastrophically six seconds after liftoff from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Regional_Spaceport"] Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallops_Flight_Facility"] Wallops Flight Facility,
Virginia.[49] An explosion occurred in the thrust section just as the vehicle cleared the tower, and it fell back down onto
the launch pad. The range safety officer sent the destruct command just before impact.[15][50] There were no
injuries.[51] Orbital Sciences reported that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_Regional_Spaceport_Launch_Pad_0"] Launch Pad 0A "escaped significant damage",[50] though initial estimates
for repairs were in the $20 million range.[52] Orbital Sciences formed an anomaly investigation board to investigate the
cause of the incident. They traced it to a failure of the first stage LOX turbopump, but could not find a specific cause.
However, the refurbished NK-33 engines, originally manufactured over 40 years earlier and stored for decades, were
Page 6
suspected as having leaks, corrosion, or
manufacturing defects that had not been
detected.[53] The NASA Accident Investigation
Report was more direct in its failure
assessment.[54] On October 6, 2015, almost one
Video of Cygnus CRS Orb-3 failed
launch. 
year after the accident, Pad 0A was restored to
use. Total repair costs were about $15 million.[55] Pad 0A after the
incident.
Following the failure, Orbital sought to purchase
launch services for its Cygnus spacecraft in order
to satisfy its cargo contract with NASA,[28] and on December 9, 2014, Orbital
 announced that at least one, and possibly two, Cygnus flights would be launched on Atlas V rockets from Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station.[56] As it happened, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_CRS_OA-4"] Cygnus OA-4 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_CRS_OA-6"] Cygnus OA-6 were launched with an Atlas V and
the Antares 230 performed its maiden flight with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_CRS_OA-5"] Cygnus OA-5 in October 2016. One further mission was launched
aboard an Atlas in April 2017 ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_CRS_OA-7"] Cygnus OA-7), fulfilling Orbital's contractual obligations towards NASA. It was
followed by the Antares 230 in regular service with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_CRS_OA-8E"] Cygnus OA-8E in November 2017, with three further missions
scheduled on their extended contract.
