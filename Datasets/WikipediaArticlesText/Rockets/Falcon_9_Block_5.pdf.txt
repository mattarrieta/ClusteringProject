Falcon 9 Block 5
Falcon 9 Block 5 is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_launch_system#Partial_reusable_launch_systems"] partially reusable [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stage-to-orbit"] two-stage-to-orbit
 medium-lift launch vehicle designed and manufactured in the
 United States by SpaceX. It is the fifth version of Falcon 9
Full Thrust,[7][8] powered by SpaceX [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(rocket_engine_family)"] Merlin engines burning
rocket-grade kerosene ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP-1"] RP-1) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen"] liquid oxygen (LOX).
The main changes from Block 3 to Block 5 are higher-thrust
engines and improvements to the landing legs. Numerous
other small changes helped streamline recovery and re-
usability of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falcon_9_first-stage_boosters"] first-stage boosters, increase production rate, and
optimize re-usability. Each Block 5 booster is designed to fly
10 times with only minor attention and up to 100 times with
refurbishment.[9]
In 2018, Falcon 9 Block 5 succeeded the transitional Block 4
version. The maiden flight launched the satellite
 Bangabandhu-1 on May 11, 2018. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_CRS-15"] CRS-15 mission on
June 29, 2018 was the last Block 4 version of Falcon 9 to be
launched. This was the transition to an all-Block 5
fleet.[10][11]

Overview
The Block 5 design changes are principally driven by
upgrades needed for NASA's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Development"] Commercial Crew program
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Space_Launch"] National Security Space Launch requirements. They
include performance upgrades, manufacturing improvements,
and "probably 100 or so changes" to increase the margin for
demanding customers.[13]
In April 2017, SpaceX CEO [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk"] Elon Musk said that Block 5
will feature 7–8% more thrust by uprating the engines (from
176,000 pounds-force (780,000 N) to 190,000 pounds-force 
The Block 5 variant of the Falcon 9
launching Crew Dragon during the
 Demo-2 mission from Kennedy Space
Center on May 30, 2020. The rocket's
distinguishing black thermal-protection
coating on the interstage is discernible.

includes an improved
flight control system
for an optimized
 angle of attack on the
descent, lowering

requirements.
For reusability endurance:
expected to be able to be launched at least 10
times;[14][15] achieved in 2021[16]
up to 100 uses with refurbishment;[15][14][17]
a reusable heat shield protecting the engines and
plumbing at the base of the rocket;
more temperature-resistant cast and machined
 titanium grid fins;[18]
a thermal-protection coating on the first stage to
limit reentry heating damage, including a black
thermal protection layer on the landing legs,
raceway, and interstage;
redesigned and requalified more robust and longer
life valves;
 redesigned composite overwrapped pressure
vessels (COPV 2.0) for helium, to avoid oxygen
freezing inside the structure of the tanks that lead to
rupture.
For rapid reusability:
reduced refurbishment between flights;[15]
a set of retractable landing legs for rapid recovery
and shipping.[19]
the Octaweb structure is bolted together instead of
welded, reducing manufacturing time.[20]

The NASA certification processes of the 2010s specified
seven flights of any launch vehicle without major design
 changes before the vehicle would be NASA-certified for
human spaceflight, and allowed to fly NASA
astronauts.[21][22] The initial Block 5 boosters did not have
