LauncherOne
LauncherOne is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stage-to-orbit"] two-stage [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_launch_vehicle"] orbital launch vehicle developed and flown by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Orbit"] Virgin Orbit that
 began operational flights in 2021, after being in development from 2007 to 2020. It is an air-
 launched rocket, designed to carry smallsat payloads of up to 300 kg (660 lb) into Sun-
synchronous orbit (SSO),[3] following [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_launch"] air launch from a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_ship"] carrier aircraft at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude"] high altitude. The
rocket is carried to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_atmosphere"] upper atmosphere on a modified [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747-400"] Boeing 747-400, named [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Girl_(aircraft)"] Cosmic Girl,
and released over the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean"] Pacific Ocean. Initial work on the program was done by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Galactic"] Virgin Galactic,
another [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Group"] Virgin Group subsidiary, before a separate entity — [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Orbit"] Virgin Orbit — was formed in
2017 to complete development and operate the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_service_provider"] launch service provider business as a separate
entity from the passenger-carrying Virgin Galactic business. 
LauncherOne
The first successful flight was on 17 January 2021, which delivered a payload of 10 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat"] CubeSats
to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit"] low Earth orbit (LEO).[8] Two additional launches also successfully made it to orbit.
LauncherOne was the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_propellant_rocket"] all liquid-fuelled air-launched orbital rocket.[9] A previous test flight
was unsuccessful on 25 May 2020, when the rocket failed to reach space.[10]
From 2007 to 2015, Virgin had intended LauncherOne to be a somewhat smaller vehicle with a
200 kg (440 lb) payload to low Earth orbit. In 2015, Virgin modified the vehicle design to better
target their intended market, and increased the vehicle payload capacity to 300 kg (660 lb)
launched to a 500 km (310 mi) Sun-synchronous orbit, suitable for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat"] CubeSats and small
payloads. Virgin Orbit is targeting a launch price around US$12 million for the rocket.[2]

History
 Virgin Galactic began working on the LauncherOne concept in 2007,[11] and the technical
specifications were first described in some detail in late 2009.[12] The LauncherOne
configuration was proposed to be an expendable, two-stage, liquid-fueled rocket [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_launch_to_orbit"] air-launched
from a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Knight_Two"] White Knight Two carrier aircraft.[13] This would make it a similar configuration to that
used by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_Sciences"] Orbital Sciences' Pegasus, or a smaller version of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_Stratolaunch"] StratoLaunch air-launched rocket
system.
By 2012, several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_spaceflight"] commercial customers had signed early contracts for launches signaling
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_(economics)"] demand-side support for new small commercial-oriented [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_vehicle"] launch vehicles. These included
 GeoOptics, Skybox Imaging, Spaceflight Services, and Planetary Resources. Both Surrey

developing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_bus"] satellite buses "optimized to the design of LauncherOne".[14][15] In October 2012,
Virgin announced that LauncherOne would be designed so that it could place 200 kg (440 lb)
in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit"] Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO).[16] Virgin planned at the time to market the 200 kg (440 lb)
payload delivery to Sun-synchronous orbit for under US$10 million per mission,[14] while the
maximum payload for low Earth orbit (LEO) missions would be somewhat larger at 500 kg
(1,100 lb).[17]
Under plans announced in 2012, the second stage was to be powered by NewtonOne, a 16 kN
(3,600 lbf) thrust engine, and the first stage by a scaled-up version called NewtonTwo, with
211 kN (47,000 lbf) of thrust. Design and construction of the first engines was completed by
2014. NewtonOne was tested up to a full-duration burn of five minutes. NewtonTwo made
several short-duration firings by early 2014.[17] Ultimately, however, neither NewtonOne nor
NewtonTwo would be used on LauncherOne.
In 2015, Virgin Galactic established a 14,000 m2 (150,000 sq ft) research, development, and
manufacturing center for LauncherOne at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach_Airport"] Long Beach Airport.[18] The company reported
in March 2015, that they were on schedule to begin test flights of LauncherOne with its
NewtonThree engine by the end of 2016,[19] but they did not achieve that objective.
On 25 June 2015, the company signed a contract with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneWeb"] OneWeb Ltd. for 39 satellite launches for
its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneWeb_satellite_constellation"] satellite constellation with an option for an additional 100 launches,[20] but in 2018 OneWeb
canceled all but four, prompting a lawsuit from Virgin Orbit.[21] OneWeb filed for bankruptcy
protection in 2020.[22]
News reports in September 2015 indicated that the heavier payload of 200 kg (440 lb) was to
be achieved by longer fuel tanks and use of the recently qualified NewtonThree engine, but this
also meant that the Virgin-developed carrier aircraft [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_White_Knight_Two"] White Knight Two would no longer be able
to lift the rocket to launch altitude, so in December 2015, Virgin announced a change to the
carrier plane for LauncherOne to carry the heavier payload. The carrier aircraft subsequently
was changed to a used Boeing 747-400,[23] Cosmic Girl,  previously operated by Virgin
Galactic's sister company, Virgin Atlantic, and purchased outright by Virgin Group from
 Boeing upon the expiration of that airframe's lease. The 747 will allow a larger LauncherOne to
carry the heavier payloads. The modification work on the company's 747 was expected to be
completed in 2016, to be followed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_spaceflight"] orbital test launches of the rocket in 2017.[24][25][26]
It was further announced in December 2015 that the revised LauncherOne would utilize the
larger NewtonThree rocket engine on the booster stage, with the NewtonFour powering the
 second stage.[24] NewtonThree was to be a 260–335 kN (58,000–75,000 lbf)-thrust engine, and
began [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hot-fire_testing&action=edit&redlink=1"] hot-fire testing by March 2015.[19][27] The NewtonFour engine would power the second
stage. NewtonThree generate 326.8 kN (73,500 lbf) of thrust while NewtonFour deliver
26.5 kN (6,000 lbf) to the second stage and is capable of multiple restarts.[28]

On 2 March 2017, Virgin Galactic announced that its 200-member LauncherOne team was being spun off into a new company called
 Virgin Orbit.[29] A subsidiary company of Virgin Orbit called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vox_Space&action=edit&redlink=1"] Vox Space was created to carry out business which require strict security
requirements.[30][31] As of 2017, the company planned to fly approximately twice a month by 2020.[32]
 In September 2017, the first test flights of LauncherOne were delayed to 2018.[32] By June 2018, the Virgin Orbit captive carry flight
testing campaign for LauncherOne, including a planned [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_test"] drop test of an unfueled rocket, was licensed to begin in July 2018, and could
run for up to six months.[28]
In the event, no LauncherOne test flights occurred in 2018 and were delayed further, to December 2019, with only the carrier aircraft
beginning to fly in 2018. The first three test flights of Cosmic Girl, including the pylon but not the rocket, happened on 23, 25 and 27
August 2018.[33][34] A high-speed taxi test, with a rocket mounted beneath the aircraft, took place in early November 2018.[35] The
aircraft flew its first test flight with both pylon and rocket attached on 18 November 2018.[36][37]
Flights
The maiden flight of LauncherOne took place on 25 May 2020. The flight failed a few seconds after the ignition of the rocket due to a
premature shutdown of the first stage engine, caused by a break in a propellant feed line,[38] and the rocket did not reach space. The
launch failure was attributed to a failure of a high-pressure [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen"] liquid oxygen [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_line"] fuel line in the NewtonThree engine. Due to the failure,
oxygen was no longer supplied to the engine and the flight was terminated. The issue with the fuel line was addressed by strengthening
the broken components.[39][40]

The second launch took place on 17 January 2021, and was the first to successfully reach
orbit.[8] The rocket deployed 10 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CubeSat"] CubeSats for NASA's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_Launch_of_Nanosatellites"] Educational Launch of Nanosatellites
mission (ELaNa 20).[41] Cosmic Girl took off from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Air_and_Space_Port"] Mojave Air and Space Port in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"] California at
18:38 UTC. The aircraft launched the LauncherOne rocket at 19:39 UTC.[9] The launch
occurred at the altitude of 10,700 m (35,100 ft).[42]
On 17 January 2021, both NewtonThree and NewtonFour performed as expected.[41] During
launch, NewtonFour fired twice; once to inject the second stage and the payloads into a transfer
orbit, and again to circularize the orbit.[41][43]
Design 
Cosmic Girl carrying LauncherOne
during the first successful flight in
January 2021.
LauncherOne is a two-stage air-launched vehicle. The rocket has a diameter of 1.6 m (5 ft 3 in)
for the first stage and 1.3 m (4 ft 3 in) for the second stage and payload fairing.[6]
In October 2019, the company announced plans to develop a three-stage variant that would be capable of launching 100 kg (220 lb) to
the Moon, 70 kg (150 lb) to Venus, or 50 kg (110 lb) to Mars.[4]
Engines
LauncherOne will be a two-stage air-launched vehicle using Newton engines, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP-1"] RP-1/[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen"] LOX [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid-propellant_rocket"] liquid rocket engines. The second stage was
to be powered by NewtonOne, a 211 kN (47,000 lbf) thrust engine. It was originally intended that the first stage will be powered by a
scaled-up design of the same basic technology as NewtonOne, called NewtonTwo, with 211.5 kN (47,500 lbf) of thrust. Both engines
have been designed, and as of January 2014 first articles have been built. NewtonOne was tested up to a full-duration burn of five
minutes. NewtonTwo made several short-duration firings by early 2014.[17]
NewtonThree is a 260–335 kN (58,000–75,000 lbf)-thrust engine, and began [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hot-fire_test&action=edit&redlink=1"] hot-fire tests as of March 2015. More recent reports
suggest that a NewtonThree will power the first stage of LauncherOne.[19][44]
2015 redesign: new engines, larger payloads, new carrier aircraft
News reports in September 2015 indicate that the higher payload is to be achieved by longer
fuel tanks and the NewtonThree engine but this will mean that White Knight Two will no longer
be able to lift it to launch altitude. The rocket will be carried to launch altitude by a Boeing
747.[45][46] The revised LauncherOne will utilize both the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Newton_3&action=edit&redlink=1"] Newton 3 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Newton_4&action=edit&redlink=1"] Newton 4 rocket
engines.[24]
In December 2015, Virgin announced a change to the carrier plane for LauncherOne, as well as
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_747"] a substantially-larger design point for the rocket itself. The carrier aircraft will now be a Boeing
747, which will in turn allow a larger LauncherOne to carry heavier payloads than previously
planned. The modification work on the particular Boeing 747 that Virgin has purchased is
expected to be completed in 2016, to be followed by Orbital test launches of the rocket in
2017.[24] 
LauncherOne will be launched from
this former [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Atlantic"] Virgin Atlantic Boeing
747, named Cosmic Girl.
Intended usage
LauncherOne is designed to launch a 300 kg (660 lb) payload to a 500 km (310 mi) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun-synchronous_orbit"] Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO), suitable for
 CubeSats and small payloads.[47][48] Virgin Orbit has also announced the ability of LauncherOne to send payloads into heliocentric
orbit for flybys of Mars, Venus or asteroids.[49]
Launch sites
Virgin Orbit integrate payloads at their headquarters in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California"] Long Beach, California.[3]
LauncherOne is launched from its Cosmic Girl Boeing 747-400 carrier, attached to a pylon on the aircraft's left wing, and released over
the ocean at a location depending on the desired orbital inclination. This process avoids typical delays for ground launches due to
weather and upper-level winds.[3] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Pomerantz"] William Pomerantz of Virgin Orbit has stated that any airport that can support a Boeing 747 may be
used, subject to local legislation.[50]
Page 4
As of 2021, the carrier plane has always lifted off from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Air_and_Space_Port"] Mojave Air and Space Port in
 California, United States. The company also has plans to use other airports such as Kennedy
Space Center in Florida, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newquay_Airport"] Newquay Airport in Cornwall, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"] United Kingdom. Other proposed
 launch sites include Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport in Hawaii, José Aponte de la
