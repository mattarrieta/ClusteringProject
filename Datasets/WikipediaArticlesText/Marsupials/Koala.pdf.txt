Koala
The koala or, inaccurately, koala bear (Phascolarctos cinereus)
is an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arboreal"] arboreal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivorous"] herbivorous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupial"] marsupial native to Australia. It is the
only [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extant_taxon"] extant representative of the family [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phascolarctidae"] Phascolarctidae and its
closest living relatives are the wombats. The koala is found in
coastal areas of the mainland's eastern and southern regions,
 inhabiting Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South
Australia. It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and
large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose.
The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs
4–15 kg (9–33 lb).  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur"] Fur colour ranges from silver grey to
chocolate brown. Koalas from the northern populations are
typically smaller and lighter in colour than their counterparts
further south. These populations possibly are separate
subspecies, but this is disputed.

Koalas typically inhabit open [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus"] Eucalyptus woodland, the leaves
of these trees make up most of their diet. Because this eucalypt
diet has limited nutritional and caloric content, koalas are largely
 sedentary and sleep up to 20 hours a day. They are asocial
animals, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_bond"] bonding exists only between mothers and
dependent offspring. Adult males [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_communication"] communicate with loud
bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. Males mark their
presence with secretions from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scent_gland"] scent glands located on their
chests. Being marsupials, koalas give birth to underdeveloped
young that crawl into their mothers' pouches, where they stay for
the first six to seven months of their lives. These young koalas,
known as joeys, are fully [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaned"] weaned around a year old. Koalas
have few natural predators and parasites, but are threatened by
various pathogens, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydiaceae"] Chlamydiaceae bacteria and the
 koala retrovirus.
Because of its distinctive appearance, the koala is recognised
worldwide as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_of_Australia"] symbol of Australia. They were hunted by
 Indigenous Australians and depicted in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_mythology"] myths and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_art"] cave art for
millennia. The first recorded encounter between a European and
a koala was in 1798, and an image of the animal was published
in 1810 by naturalist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Perry_(naturalist)"] George Perry. Botanist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brown_(Scottish_botanist_from_Montrose)"] Robert Brown
wrote the first detailed scientific [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_description"] description of the koala in 1814,
although his work remained unpublished for 180 years. Popular
artist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gould"] John Gould illustrated and described the koala, introducing
the species to the general British public. Further details about the
animal's biology were revealed in the 19th century by several
English scientists. Koalas are listed as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"] vulnerable species by
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature"] International Union for Conservation of Nature. Among the
many threats to their existence are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction"] habitat destruction caused by
agriculture, urbanisation, droughts and associated bushfires,

Etymology
The word koala comes from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Language"] Dharug gula, meaning no water. Although the vowel 'u' was originally
written in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_orthography"] English orthography as "oo" (in spellings such as coola or koolah — two syllables), later
became "oa" and is now pronounced in three syllables, possibly in error.[4]
 Adopted by white settlers, "koala" became one of several hundred Aboriginal loan words in Australian
English, where it was also commonly referred to as "native bear",[5] later "koala bear", for its supposed
resemblance to a bear.[6] It is also one of several Aboriginal words that made it into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_English"] International English,
alongside e.g. "didgeridoo" and "kangaroo."[6] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"] generic name, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phascolarctos"] Phascolarctos, is derived from the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek"] Greek words phaskolos "pouch" and arktos "bear".  The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_name_(zoology)"] specific name, cinereus,  is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"] Latin for "ash
coloured".[7]

([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo"] kangaroos and wallabies)
and possums.[12] The ancestors of vombatiforms were likely arboreal,[8] and the koala's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineage_(evolution)"] lineage was
possibly the first to branch off around 40 million years ago during the Eocene.[13]
The modern koala is the only [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extant_taxon"] extant member of Phascolarctidae, a family that once included several genera
and species. During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligocene"] Oligocene and Miocene, koalas lived in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest"] rainforests and had less specialised
diets.[14] Some species, such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riversleigh_rainforest_koala"] Riversleigh rainforest koala (Nimiokoala greystanesi) and some species
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perikoala"] Perikoala, were around the same size as the modern koala, while others, such as species of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litokoala"] Litokoala,
Page 4
Reconstructions of the
ancient koalas Nimiokoala
(larger), and Litokoala
(smaller), from the Miocene
Riversleigh Fauna 
were one-half to two-thirds its size.[15] Like the modern species, prehistoric
koalas had well developed ear structures which suggests that long-distance
vocalising and sedentism developed early.[14] During the Miocene, the
Australian continent began drying out, leading to the decline of rainforests
and the spread of open [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus"] Eucalyptus woodlands. The genus Phascolarctos
split from Litokoala in the late Miocene[14][16] and had several adaptations
that allowed it to live on a specialised eucalyptus diet: a shifting of the
 palate towards the front of the skull; larger [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molar_(tooth)"] molars and premolars; smaller
 pterygoid fossa;[14] and a larger [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diastema_(dentistry)"] gap between the molar and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"] incisor
teeth.[17]: 226 
P. cinereus may have emerged as a dwarf form of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_koala"] giant koala
(P. stirtoni). The reduction in the size of large mammals has been seen as a
common phenomenon worldwide during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Pleistocene"] late Pleistocene, and several
Australian mammals, such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_wallaby"] agile wallaby, are traditionally believed to
have resulted from this dwarfing. A 2008 study questions this hypothesis,
noting that P. cinereus and P. stirtoni were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympatry"] sympatric during the middle to
late Pleistocene, and possibly as early as the Pliocene.[18] The fossil record
of the modern koala extends back at least to the middle Pleistocene.[19]
Genetics and variations
Three [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies"] subspecies are recognised: the Queensland koala (Phascolarctos cinereus adustus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldfield_Thomas"] Thomas 1923),
the New South Wales koala (Phascolarctos cinereus cinereus, Goldfuss 1817), and the Victorian koala
(Phascolarctos cinereus victor, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Le_Geyt_Troughton"] Troughton 1935). These forms are distinguished by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelage"] pelage colour and
thickness, body size, and skull shape. The Queensland koala is the smallest of the three, with shorter, silver
fur and a shorter skull. The Victorian koala is the largest, with shaggier, brown fur and a wider
skull.[20]: 7 [21] The boundaries of these variations are based on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia"] state borders, and their status as subspecies
is disputed. A 1999 genetic study suggests that the variations represent differentiated populations with
 limited gene flow between them, and that the three subspecies comprise a single evolutionarily significant
 unit.[21] Other studies have found that koala populations have high levels of inbreeding and low genetic
variation.[22][23] Such low [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"] genetic diversity may have been a characteristic of koala populations since the
late Pleistocene.[24] Rivers and roads have been shown to limit gene flow and contribute to the genetic
 differentiation of southeast Queensland populations.[25] In April 2013, scientists from the Australian
Museum and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_University_of_Technology"] Queensland University of Technology announced they had [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_genome_sequencing"] fully sequenced the koala
genome.[26]
Characteristics and adaptations
The koala is a stocky animal with a large head and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestigiality"] vestigial or non-
existent tail.[10]: 1 [27] It has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in)
and a weight of 4–15 kg (9–33 lb),[27] making it among the largest
arboreal marsupials.[28] Koalas from Victoria are twice as heavy as
those from Queensland.[20]: 7  The species is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"] sexually dimorphic,
with males 50% larger than females. Males are further distinguished
from females by their more curved noses[28] and the presence of
chest glands, which are visible as hairless patches.[20]: 55  As in
most marsupials, the male koala has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupial_penis"] bifurcated penis,[29] and the Scratching and grooming
Page 5
female has two lateral [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagina"] vaginas and two separate uteri.[10]: 3  The male's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penile_sheath"] penile sheath contains naturally
occurring bacteria that play an important role in fertilisation.[30] The female's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pouch_(marsupial)"] pouch opening is tightened by
a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphincter"] sphincter that keeps the young from falling out.[31]
The pelage of the koala is thicker and longer on the back, and shorter on the belly. The ears have thick fur
on both the inside and outside.[28] The back fur colour varies from light grey to chocolate brown.[10]: 1–2 
The belly fur is whitish; on the rump it is dappled whitish, and darker at the back.[27] The koala has the
most effective insulating back fur of any marsupial and is highly resilient to wind and rain, while the belly
fur can reflect solar radiation.[32] The koala's curved, sharp claws are well adapted for climbing trees. The
large forepaws have two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumb#Other_animals_with_opposable_digits"] opposable digits (the first and second, which are opposable to the other three) that
allow them to grasp small branches. On the hindpaws, the second and third digits are fused, a typical
condition for members of the Diprotodontia, and the attached claws (which are still separate) are used for
grooming.[20]: 5  As in humans and other primates, koalas have [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermal_papillae"] friction ridges on their paws.[33] The animal
has a sturdy skeleton and a short, muscular upper body with proportionately long upper limbs that
contribute to its climbing and grasping abilities. Additional climbing strength is achieved with thigh muscles
that attach to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinbone"] shinbone lower than other animals.[2]: 183  The koala has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartilage"] cartilaginous pad at the end of
the spine that may make it more comfortable when it perches in the fork of a tree.[31]
The koala has one of the smallest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-to-body_mass_ratio"] brains in proportion to body weight of
any mammal,[10]: 81  being 60% smaller than that of a typical diprotodont,
weighing only 19.2 g (0.68 oz) on average.[34] The brain's surface is fairly
smooth, typical for a "primitive" animal.[20]: 52  It occupies only 61% of the
 cranial cavity[10]: 81  and is pressed against the inside surface by
 cerebrospinal fluid. The function of this relatively large amount of fluid is
not known, although one possibility is that it acts as a shock absorber,
cushioning the brain if the animal falls from a tree.[20]: 52  The koala's small
brain size may be an adaptation to the energy restrictions imposed by its
diet, which is insufficient to sustain a larger brain.[10]: 81  Because of its
small brain, the koala has a limited ability to perform complex, unfamiliar
behaviours. For example, when presented with plucked leaves on a flat
surface, the animal cannot adapt to the change in its normal feeding routine
and will not eat the leaves.[17]: 234  The koala's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory"] olfactory senses are normal,
Mounted skeleton and it is known to sniff the oils of individual branchlets to assess their
edibility.[10]: 81  Its nose is fairly large and covered in leathery skin. Its
round ears provide it with good hearing,[31] and it has a well-developed
 middle ear.[14] A koala's vision is not well developed,[31] and its relatively small eyes are unusual among
marsupials in that the pupils have vertical slits.[28] Koalas make use of a novel vocal organ to produce low-
pitched sounds (see social spacing, below). Unlike typical mammalian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_cords"] vocal cords, which are folds in the
larynx, these organs are placed in the velum ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_palate"] soft palate) and are called velar vocal cords.[35][36]
The koala has several adaptations for its eucalypt diet, which is of
low nutritive value, of high toxicity, and high in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_fibre"] dietary fibre.[10]: 76 
The animal's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"] dentition consists of the incisors and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek_teeth"] cheek teeth (a
single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated
by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals).
The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to  Teeth of a koala, from left to right:
the premolars to be snipped at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petiole_(botany)"] petiole before being passed to the molars, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premolar"] premolars (dark), diastema,
highly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusp_(dentistry)"] cusped molars, where they are shredded into small
pieces.[20]: 46  Koalas may also store food in their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheek_pouch"] cheek pouches 
canines, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incisor"] incisors
before it is ready to be chewed.[37] The partially worn molars of
middle-aged koalas are optimal for breaking the leaves into small particles, resulting in more efficient
Page 6
stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine,[17]: 231  which digests the eucalyptus leaves
to provide most of the animal's energy.[20]: 47  A koala sometimes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regurgitation_(digestion)"] regurgitates the food into the mouth to be
chewed a second time.[38]
Unlike kangaroos and eucalyptus-eating possums, koalas are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindgut_fermentation"] hindgut fermenters, and their digestive
retention can last for up to 100 hours in the wild, or up to 200 hours in captivity.[20]: 48  This is made
possible by the extraordinary length of their caecum—200 cm (80 in) long and 10 cm (4 in) in diameter—
the largest proportionally of any animal.[2]: 188  Koalas can select which food particles to retain for longer
fermentation and which to pass through. Large particles typically pass through more quickly, as they would
take more time to digest.[20]: 48  While the hindgut is proportionally larger in the koala than in other
herbivores, only 10% of the animal's energy is obtained from fermentation. Since the koala gains a low
amount of energy from its diet, its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate"] metabolic rate is half that of a typical mammal,[10]: 76  although this can
vary between seasons and sexes.[20]: 49  They are able to digest the toxins present in eucalyptus leaves due
to their production of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450"] cytochrome P450, which breaks down these poisons in the liver.[39] The koala
conserves water by passing relatively dry faecal pellets high in undigested fibre, and by storing water in the
caecum.[17]: 231 
Distribution and habitat
The koala's geographic range covers roughly 1,000,000 km2 (390,000 sq mi), and 30 ecoregions.[40] It
extends throughout eastern and southeastern Australia, encompassing northeastern, central and southeastern
Queensland, eastern New South Wales, Victoria, and southeastern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia"] South Australia. The koala was
 reintroduced near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide"] Adelaide and on several islands, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Island"] Kangaroo Island and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Island_(Victoria)"] French Island.[1] The
population on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_Island"] Magnetic Island represents the northern limit of its range.[40] Fossil evidence shows that the
koala's range stretched as far west as southwestern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia"] Western Australia during the late Pleistocene.[20] Koalas
were introduced to Western Australia at Yanchep.[41] They were likely driven to extinction in these areas
by environmental changes and hunting by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians"] Indigenous Australians.[20]: 12–13  In South Australia, koalas
were only known to exist in recent times in the lower South East,[20]: 32  with a remnant population in the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangham_Conservation_Park"] Bangham Forest between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordertown,_South_Australia"] Bordertown and Naracoorte,[42] until introduced to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Lofty_Ranges"] Mount Lofty Ranges in
the 20th-century. Doubts have been cast on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_John_Eyre"] Eyre's identification as koala pelt a girdle being worn by an
Aboriginal man, the only evidence of their existence elsewhere in the State.[43]Koalas can be found in
habitats ranging from relatively open forests to woodlands, and in climates ranging from tropical to cool
temperate.[28] In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-arid_climate"] semi-arid climates, they prefer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparian_habitat"] riparian habitats, where nearby streams and creeks provide
refuge during times of drought and extreme heat.[44]
Ecology and behaviour
Foraging and activities
Koalas are herbivorous, and while most of their diet consists of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalypt"] eucalypt leaves, they can be found in trees
of other genera, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia"] Acacia, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allocasuarina"] Allocasuarina, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callitris"] Callitris, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospermum"] Leptospermum, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melaleuca"] Melaleuca.[10]: 73  Though
the foliage of over 600 species of Eucalyptus is available, the koala shows a strong preference for around
30.[45] They tend to choose species that have a high [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)"] protein content and low proportions of fibre and
lignin.[17]: 231  The most favoured species are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus_microcorys"] Eucalyptus microcorys, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus_tereticornis"] E. tereticornis, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus_camaldulensis"] E. camaldulensis,
which, on average, make up more than 20% of their diet.[46] They will also consume other species in the
genus such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus_ovata"] E. ovata, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus_punctata"] E. punctata, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus_viminalis"] E. viminalis.[47] Despite its reputation as a fussy eater, the koala is
more [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalist_and_specialist_species"] generalist than some other marsupial species, such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_glider"] greater glider. Since eucalypt leaves have a
high water content, the koala does not need to drink often;[10]: 74  its daily water turnover rate ranges from
Page 7
Foraging 
71 to 91 ml/kg of body weight. Although females can meet their
water requirements from eating leaves, larger males require
additional water found on the ground or in tree hollows.[17]: 231 
When feeding, a koala holds onto a branch with hindpaws and one
forepaw while the other forepaw grasps foliage. Small koalas can
move close to the end of a branch, but larger ones stay near the
thicker bases.[10]: 96  Koalas consume up to 400 grams (14 oz) of
leaves a day, spread over four to six feeding sessions.[2]: 187 
Despite their adaptations to a low-energy lifestyle, they have
meagre [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue"] fat reserves and need to feed often.[2]: 189 
Because they get so little energy from their diet, koalas must limit
their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_balance_(biology)#Energy_expenditure"] energy use and sleep or rest 20 hours a day.[10]: 93 [48] They are predominantly active at night and
spend most of their waking hours feeding. They typically eat and sleep in the same tree, possibly for as
long as a day.[20]: 39  On very hot days, a koala may climb down to the coolest part of the tree which is
cooler than the surrounding air. The koala hugs the tree to lose heat without panting.[49][50] On warm days,
a koala may rest with its back against a branch or lie on its stomach or back with its limbs
dangling.[10]: 93–94  During cold, wet periods, it curls itself into a tight ball to conserve energy.[20]: 39  On
windy days, a koala finds a lower, thicker branch on which to rest. While it spends most of the time in the
tree, the animal descends to the ground to move to another tree.[10]: 94  The koala usually grooms itself with
its hindpaws, but sometimes uses its forepaws or mouth.[10]: 97–98 
Social spacing
Koalas are asocial animals and
spend just 15 minutes a day on
 social behaviours. In Victoria, home
ranges are small and have extensive
overlap, while in  central
Queensland they are larger and
overlap less.[10]: 98  Koala society
appears to consist of "residents" and
"transients",  the former being  0:00
mostly adult females and the latter
males. Resident males appear to be
 territorial and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(ethology)"] dominate others with
 their larger body size.[51] Alpha 
Resting  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Pine_Koala_Sanctuary"] A bellowing male in the Lone Pine Koala
Sanctuary
males tend to establish their
territories close to breeding females,
while younger males are subordinate until they mature and reach full size.[2]: 191  Adult males occasionally
venture outside their home ranges; when they do so, dominant ones retain their status.[10]: 99  When a male
enters a new tree, he marks it by rubbing his chest gland against the trunk or a branch; males have
occasionally been observed to dribble urine on the trunk. This scent-marking behaviour probably serves as
communication, and individuals are known to sniff the base of a tree before climbing.[20]: 54–56  Scent
marking is common during aggressive encounters.[52] Chest gland secretions are complex chemical
mixtures—about 40 compounds were identified in one analysis—that vary in composition and
concentration with the season and the age of the individual.[53]
Page 8
Adult males communicate with loud bellows—low pitched sounds that
consist of snore-like inhalations and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_resonance"] resonant exhalations that sound like
growls.[54] These sounds are thought to be generated by unique vocal
organs found in koalas.[35] Because of their low frequency, these bellows
can travel far through air and vegetation.[20]: 56  Koalas may bellow at any
time of the year, particularly during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_breeder"] breeding season, when it serves to
attract females and possibly intimidate other males.[55] They also bellow to
advertise their presence to their neighbours when they enter a new
tree.[20]: 57  These sounds signal the male's actual body size, as well as
exaggerate it;[56] females pay more attention to bellows that originate from
larger males.[57] Female koalas bellow, though more softly, in addition to
making snarls, wails, and screams. These calls are produced when in
distress and when making defensive threats.[54] Young koalas squeak when

in distress. As they get older, the squeak develops into a "squawk"
produced both when in distress and to show aggression. When another
individual climbs over it, a koala makes a low grunt with its mouth closed.
Koalas make numerous facial expressions. When snarling, wailing, or
squawking, the animal curls the upper lip and points its ears forward.
During screams, the lips retract and the ears are drawn back. Females bring their lips forward and raise their
ears when agitated.[10]: 102–05 
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonistic_behaviour"] Agonistic behaviour typically consists of squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each
other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each
other.[10]: 102 [58] In extreme situations, a male may try to displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves
the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and
climb down or to move to the end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by grasping the target by the
shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and
marks the tree.[10]: 101–02  Pregnant and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation"] lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals
that come too close.[58] In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive
behaviour.[2]: 191 
Reproduction and development
Koalas are seasonal breeders, and births take place from the middle of spring through the summer to early
autumn, from October to May. Females in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oestrus"] oestrus tend to hold their heads further back than usual and
commonly display [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremor"] tremors and spasms. However, males do not appear to recognise these signs, and have
been observed to mount non-oestrous females. Because of his much larger size, a male can usually force
himself on a female, mounting her from behind, and in extreme cases, the male may pull the female out of
the tree. A female may scream and vigorously fight off her suitors, but will submit to one that is dominant
or is more familiar. The bellows and screams that accompany matings can attract other males to the scene,
obliging the incumbent to delay mating and fight off the intruders. These fights may allow the female to
assess which is dominant.[20]: 58–60  Older males usually have accumulated scratches, scars, and cuts on the
exposed parts of their noses and on their eyelids.[2]: 192 
The koala's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestation"] gestation period lasts 33–35 days,[59] and a female gives birth to a single [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_(marsupial)"] joey (although twins
occur on occasion). As with all marsupials, the young are born while at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo"] embryonic stage, weighing only
0.5 g (0.02 oz). However, they have relatively well-developed lips, forelimbs, and shoulders, as well as
functioning respiratory, digestive, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_system"] urinary systems. The joey crawls into its mother's pouch to continue
the rest of its development.[20]: 61  Unlike most other marsupials, the koala does not clean her pouch.[2]: 181 
Page 9
A female koala has two teats; the joey attaches itself to one of them and
suckles for the rest of its pouch life.[20]: 61  The koala has one of the lowest
milk energy production rates in relation to body size of any mammal. The
female makes up for this by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation"] lactating for as long as 12 months.[20]: 62  At
seven weeks of age, the joey's head grows longer and becomes
proportionally large, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_pigment"] pigmentation begins to develop, and its sex can be
determined (the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"] scrotum appears in males and the pouch begins to develop
in females). At 13 weeks, the joey weighs around 50 g (1.8 oz) and its head
has doubled in size. The eyes begin to open and fine fur grows on the
forehead, nape, shoulders, and arms. At 26 weeks, the fully furred animal
resembles an adult, and begins to poke its head out of the pouch.[20]: 63 
As the young koala approaches six
months, the mother begins to
prepare it for its eucalyptus diet by
predigesting the leaves, producing a
faecal pap that the joey eats from
her cloaca. The pap is quite
different in composition from
regular faeces, resembling instead

the contents of the caecum, which
has a high concentration of bacteria. Eaten for about a month, the
pap provides a supplementary source of protein at a transition time
from a milk to a leaf diet.[17]: 235  The joey fully emerges from the
pouch for the first time at six or seven months of age, when it
Mother with joey on back 
weighs 300–500 g (11–18 oz). It explores its new surroundings
cautiously, clinging to its mother for support. By nine months, it
weighs over 1 kg (2.2 lb) and develops its adult fur colour. Having
permanently left the pouch, it rides on its mother's back for transportation, learning to climb by grasping
branches.[20]: 65–66  Gradually, it spends more time away from its mother, who becomes pregnant again
after 12 month when the young is now around.2.5 kg (5.5 lb). Her bond with her previous offspring is
permanently severed and she no longer allows it to suckle. Young will continue to live near their mother for
the next 6–12 months.[20]: 66–67 
Females become [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity"] sexually mature at about three years of age and can then become pregnant; in comparison,
males reach sexual maturity when they are about four years old,[60] although they can produce sperm as
early as two years.[20]: 68  While the chest glands can be functional as early as 18 months of age, males do
not begin scent-marking behaviours until they reach sexual maturity.[53] Because the offspring have a long
dependent period, female koalas usually breed in alternate years. Favourable environmental factors, such as
a plentiful supply of high-quality food trees, allow them to reproduce every year.[17]: 236 
Health and mortality
Koalas may live from 13 to 18 years in the wild. While female koalas usually live this long, males may die
sooner because of their more hazardous lives.[20]: 69  Koalas usually survive falls from trees and
immediately climb back up, but injuries and deaths from falls do occur, particularly in inexperienced young
and fighting males.[20]: 72–73  Around six years of age, the koala's chewing teeth begin to wear down and
their chewing efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal will die of
starvation.[61] Koalas have few predators; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingo"] dingos and large [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythonidae"] pythons may prey on them; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_prey"] birds of prey (such
as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerful_owl"] powerful owls and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge-tailed_eagle"] wedge-tailed eagles) are threats to young. Koalas are generally not subject to external
parasites, other than [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick"] ticks in coastal areas. Koalas may also suffer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mange"] mange from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mite"] mite [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcoptes_scabiei"] Sarcoptes scabiei,

infrequently found in the lungs.[62] In a three-year study of almost 600 koalas admitted to the Australian
Zoo Wildlife Hospital in Queensland, 73.8% of the animals were infected with at least one species of the
parasitic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protozoa"] protozoal genus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma"] Trypanosoma, the most common of which was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trypanosoma_irwini"] T. irwini.[63]
Koalas can be subject to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen"] pathogens such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydiaceae"] Chlamydiaceae bacteria,[20]: 74–75  which can cause
keratoconjunctivitis, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection"] urinary tract infection, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_tract_infection"] reproductive tract infection.[10]: 229–30  Such infections are
widespread on the mainland, but absent in some island populations.[20]: 114  The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koala_retrovirus"] koala retrovirus (KoRV)
may cause koala immune deficiency syndrome (KIDS) which is similar to AIDS in humans. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_prevalence"] Prevalence of
KoRV in koala populations suggests a trend spreading from the north to the south of Australia. Northern
populations are completely infected, while some southern populations (including Kangaroo Island) are
free.[64]
The animals are vulnerable to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushfires_in_Australia"] bushfires due to their slow movements and the flammability of eucalypt
trees.[20]: 26  The koala instinctively seeks refuge in the higher branches, where it is vulnerable to intense
heat and flames. Bushfires also fragment the animal's habitat, which restricts their movement and leads to
population decline and loss of genetic diversity.[2]: 209–11  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration"] Dehydration and overheating can also prove
 fatal.[10]: 80  Consequently, the koala is vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Models of climate
change in Australia predict warmer and drier climates, suggesting that the koala's range will shrink in the
east and south to more [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesic_habitat"] mesic habitats.[65]
Human relations
History
The first written reference of the koala was recorded by John Price, servant
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hunter_(Royal_Navy_officer)"] John Hunter, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_South_Wales"] Governor of New South Wales. Price encountered the
 "cullawine" on 26 January 1798, during an expedition to the Blue
Mountains,[66] although his account was not published until nearly a
century later in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Records_of_Australia"] Historical Records of Australia.[2]: 8  In 1802, French-born
explorer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Louis_Barrallier"] Francis Louis Barrallier encountered the animal when his two
Aboriginal guides, returning from a hunt, brought back two koala feet they
were intending to eat. Barrallier preserved the appendages and sent them
and his notes to Hunter's successor, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Gidley_King"] Philip Gidley King, who forwarded
them to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Banks"] Joseph Banks. Similar to Price, Barrallier's notes were not
published until 1897.[2]: 9–10  Reports of the first capture of a live "koolah"

and South American tree-living mammals of genus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradypus"] Bradypus. His disdain for the koala, evident in his
description of the animal, was typical of the prevailing early 19th-century British attitude about the
primitiveness and oddity of Australian fauna:[2]: 40 
... the eye is placed like that of the Sloth, very close to the mouth and nose, which gives it a
clumsy awkward appearance, and void of elegance in the combination ... they have little either
in their character or appearance to interest the Naturalist or Philosopher. As Nature however
provides nothing in vain, we may suppose that even these torpid, senseless creatures are wisely
intended to fill up one of the great links of the chain of animated nature ...[69]

Cultural significance
The koala is well known worldwide and is a major draw for
Australian zoos and wildlife parks. It has been featured in
advertisements, games, cartoons, and as soft toys.[10]: ix  It
benefited the national tourism industry by over an estimated billion
Australian dollars in 1998, a figure that has since grown.[2]: 201  In
1997, half of visitors to Australia, especially those from Korea,
Japan, and Taiwan, sought out zoos and wildlife parks; about 75%
of European and Japanese tourists placed the koala at the top of
their list of animals to see.[2]: 216  According to biologist Stephen
Jackson: "If you were to take a straw poll of the animal most
closely associated with Australia, it's a fair bet that the koala would
come out marginally in front of the kangaroo".[10]: ix  Factors that
contribute to the koala's enduring popularity include its childlike
body proportions and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_bear"] teddy bear-like face.[20]: 3  
Koala souvenir soft toys are popular
with tourists
The koala is featured in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamtime"] Dreamtime stories and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aboriginal_mythology"] mythology of
Indigenous Australians. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tharawal_people"] Tharawal people believed that the
animal helped row the boat that brought them to the
continent.[10]: 21  Another myth tells of how a tribe killed a koala
and used its long intestines to create a bridge for people from other
parts of the world. This narrative highlights the koala's status as a
 game animal and the length of its intestines.[20]: 17  Several stories 
Amy and Oliver the bronze
koalas (by Glenys Lindsay)
tell of how the koala lost its tail. In one, a kangaroo cuts it off to
punish the koala for being lazy and greedy.[10]: 28  Tribes in both Queensland and Victoria regarded the
koala as a wise animal and sought its advice. Bidjara-speaking people credited the koala for turning barren
lands into lush forests.[10]: 41–43  The animal is also depicted in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroglyph"] rock carvings, though not as much as some
other species.[10]: 45–46 
Early European settlers in Australia considered the koala to be a prowling sloth-like animal with a "fierce
and menacing look".[10]: 143  At the beginning of the 20th century, the koala's reputation took a more
positive turn, largely due to its growing popularity and depiction in several widely circulated children's
stories.[2]: 162  It is featured in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethel_Pedley"] Ethel Pedley's 1899 book [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_and_the_Kangaroo"] Dot and the Kangaroo, in which it is portrayed as

koalas.[78][79] The event gave rise to the term "koala diplomacy",[80][81] which then became the Oxford
Word of the Month for December 2016.[82] The term also includes the loan of koalas by the Australian
government to overseas zoos in countries such as Singapore and Japan, as a form of "soft power
diplomacy", in a manner similar to the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panda_diplomacy"] panda diplomacy" practised by China.[83][84]
Conservation issues
The koala was originally classified as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-concern_species"] Least Concern on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List"] Red List, and
reassessed as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"] Vulnerable in 2014.[1] In the Australian Capital Territory,
New South Wales and Queensland, the species was listed under the EPBC
Act in February 2022 as endangered by extinction.[85][86] The described
population was determined in 2012 to be "a species for the purposes of the
EPBC Act 1999" in Federal legislation.[87]
Australian policymakers had declined a 2009 proposal to include the koala
 in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
1999.[19] In 2012, the Australian government listed koala populations in
Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable, because of a 40%
population decline in the former and a 33% decline in the latter. A 2017 
Road sign depicting a koala
and a kangaroo
 WWF report found a 53% decline per generation in Queensland, and a
26% decline in New South Wales.[88] The koala population in South Australia and Victoria and appear to
be abundant; however, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Koala_Foundation"] Australian Koala Foundation (AKF) argued that the exclusion of Victorian
populations from protective measures was based on a misconception that the total koala population was
200,000, whereas they believed in 2012 that it was probably less than 100,000.[89] AKF estimated in 2022
that there could be as few as 43,000 individuals.[90] This is compared with 8 to 10 million at the start of the
20th century.[91][92]

The koala was heavily hunted by European settlers in the early 20th century,[2]: 121–128  largely for its thick,
soft fur. More than two million pelts are estimated to have left Australia by 1924. Pelts were in demand for
use in rugs, coat linings, muffs, and as trimming on women's garments.[2]: 125  The first successful efforts at
conserving the species were initiated by the establishment of Brisbane's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Pine_Koala_Sanctuary"] Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary and
Sydney's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koala_Park_Sanctuary"] Koala Park Sanctuary in the 1920s and 1930s. The owner of the latter park, Noel Burnet, became
the first to successfully breed koalas and earned a reputation as the foremost contemporary authority on the
marsupial.[2]: 157–159 
One of the biggest [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anthropogenic"] anthropogenic threats to the koala is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction"] habitat destruction and fragmentation. In coastal
areas, the main cause of this is urbanisation, while in rural areas, habitat is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_clearing_in_Australia"] cleared for agriculture. Native
forest trees are also taken down to be made into wood products.[20]: 104–107  In 2000, Australia ranked fifth
in the world by deforestation rates, having cleared 564,800 hectares (1,396,000 acres).[10]: 222  The
distribution of the koala has shrunk by more than 50% since European arrival, largely due to fragmentation
of habitat in Queensland.[40] Nevertheless, koalas live in many [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_area"] protected areas.[1]
While urbanisation can pose a threat to koala populations, the animals can survive in urban areas provided
enough trees are present.[93] Urban populations have distinct vulnerabilities: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadkill"] collisions with vehicles and
attacks by domestic dogs.[94] To reduce road deaths, government agencies have been exploring various
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_crossing"] wildlife crossing options,[95][96] such as the use of fencing to channel animals toward an underpass, in
some cases adding a ledge as walkway to an existing culvert.[97][98] Dogs kill about 4,000 animals every
year.[99] Injured koalas are often taken to wildlife hospitals and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_rehabilitation"] rehabilitation centres.[93] In a 30-year
 retrospective study performed at a New South Wales koala rehabilitation centre, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_(medicine)"] trauma (usually resulting
from a motor vehicle accident or dog attack) was found to be the most frequent cause of admission,
followed by symptoms of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlamydia_infection"] Chlamydia infection.[100]
