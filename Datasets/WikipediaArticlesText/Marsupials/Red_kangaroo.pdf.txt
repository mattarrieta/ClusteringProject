Red kangaroo
The red kangaroo (Osphranter rufus[5]) is the largest of all
kangaroos, the largest terrestrial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal"] mammal native to Australia, and
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_mammals#Marsupials_(Marsupialia)"] largest extant marsupial. It is found across mainland
Australia, except for the more fertile areas, such as southern
 Western Australia, the eastern and southeastern coasts, and the
rainforests along the northern coast.

Taxonomy
The initial description of the species by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anselme_Ga%C3%ABtan_Desmarest"] A.G. Desmarest was
published in 1822. The type location was given as an unknown
location west of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains_(New_South_Wales)"] Blue Mountains.The author assigned the
new species to the genus Kangurus. In 1842, Gould reassigned
the species to the genus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osphranter"] Osphranter,[6]a taxon later submerged
as a subgenus of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macropus"] Macropus.[7] A taxonomic restructure in 2015
in Taxonomy of Australian Mammals by Jackson and Groves[8]
promoted Osphranter back to genus level, redefining the red
kangaroo, among others, as species within the genus
Osphranter.[5] This was further supported by genetic analysis in
2019.[9]
Description
This species is a very large kangaroo with long, pointed ears and
 a square shaped muzzle [snout/nose].  They are sexually
dimorphic as the males have short, red-brown fur, fading to pale

then releasing its energy
to propel the animal up
and forward, enabling
the  characteristic
bouncing locomotion.
The males can cover 8–9 m (26.2–29.5 ft) in one leap while
reaching heights of 1.8–3 m (5.9–9.8 ft), though the average is
1.2–1.9 m (3.9–6.2 ft).[10][11]
Males grow up to a head-and-body length of 1.3–1.6 m (4.3–
5.2 ft) with a tail that adds a further 1.2 m (3.9 ft) to the total
length and are referred to by Australians as "Big Reds".[12]
Females are considerably smaller, with a head-and-body length
of 85–105 cm (33–41 in) and tail length of 65–85 cm (26–
33 in).[11][13] Females can weigh from 18 to 40 kg (40 to 88 lb),
while males typically weigh about twice as much at 55 to 90 kg
(121 to 198 lb).[13][14] The average red kangaroo stands
approximately 1.5 m (4.9 ft) tall to the top of the head in upright
posture.[15] Large mature males can stand more than 1.8 m
(5.9 ft) tall, with the largest confirmed one having been around
2.1 m (6.9 ft) tall and weighed 91 kg (201 lb).[14]
The red kangaroo maintains its internal temperature at a point of
homeostasis about 36 °C (97 °F) using a variety of physical,
physiological, and behavioural adaptations. These include
having an insulating layer of fur, being less active and staying in
the shade when temperatures are high, panting, sweating, and
licking its forelimbs.
The red kangaroo's range of vision is approximately 300° (324°
with about 25° overlap), due to the position of its eyes.[16]

The red kangaroo ranges
throughout western and
 central Australia. Its range
encompasses scrubland,
grassland, and desert
habitats. It typically inhabits
open habitats with some
trees for shade.[17] Red

vegetation to survive in an
arid environment. The kangaroo's kidneys efficiently concentrate urine, particularly during summer.[18] Red
kangaroo primarily eat green vegetation, particularly fresh grasses and forbs, and can get enough even
when most plants look brown and dry.[19] One study of kangaroos in Central Australia found that green
grass makes up 75–95% of the diet, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eragrostis"] Eragrostis setifolia dominating at 54%. This grass continues to be
green into the dry season.[20] Kangaroos also primarily consumed this species, along with Enneapogon
avanaceus, in western New South Wales where they comprised much as 21–69% of its diet according to a
study.[21] During dry times, kangaroos search for green plants by staying on open grassland and near
watercourses.[19] While grasses and forbs are preferred, red kangaroos will also eat certain species of
chenopods, like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassia"] Bassia diacantha and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maireana"] Maireana pyramidata, and will even browse shrubs when its
favoured foods are scarce.[19] However, some perennial chenopods, such as round-leaf chenopod [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochia"] Kochia
are avoided even when abundant.[22]
At times, red kangaroos congregate in large numbers; in areas with
much forage, these groups can number as much as 1,500
individuals. Red kangaroos are mostly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular"] crepuscular and nocturnal,
resting in the shade during the day.[23] However, they sometimes
move about during the day. Red kangaroos rely on small saltbushes
or mulga bushes for shelter in extreme heat rather than rocky
outcrops or caves.[19] Grazing takes up most of their daily
activities. Like most kangaroo species, they are mostly sedentary,
staying within a relatively well-defined home range. However,

distances.[19] Kangaroos in New South Wales have weekly home 
 Germany
ranges of 258–560 ha, with the larger areas belonging to adult
males.[24] When forage is poor and rainfall patchy, kangaroos will travel 25–30 km to more favourable
feeding grounds.[21] Another study of kangaroos in central Australia found that most of them stay close to
remaining vegetation but disperse to find fresh plants after it rains.[25] The red kangaroo is too big to be
subject to significant non-human predation. They can use their robust legs and clawed feet to defend
themselves from attackers with kicks and blows. However, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingo"] dingoes and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle"] eagles can kill and eat joeys. Joeys
are thus protected in their mother's pouch. The red kangaroo does have some major predators, like
crocodiles. Extinct predators include the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thylacoleo_carnifex"] marsupial lion, the thylacine, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalania"] Megalania,  and the wonambi.
Kangaroos are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways if threatened by a predator. If pursued into
the water, a kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning"] drown it.[26]
Behaviour
Page 4
Red kangaroos live in groups of 2–4 members. The most common
groups are females and their young.[19] Larger groups can be found
in densely populated areas and females are usually with a male.[27]
Membership of these groups is very flexible, and males (boomers)
are not territorial, fighting only over females (flyers) that come into
heat. Males develop proportionately much larger shoulders and
arms than females.[28] Most agonistic interactions occur between
young males, which engage in ritualised fighting known as boxing.
They usually stand up on their hind limbs and attempt to push their
A mob of red kangaroos at the

opponent off balance by jabbing him or locking forearms. If the
fight escalates, they will begin to kick each other. Using their tail to
support their weight, they deliver kicks with their powerful hind
legs. Compared to other kangaroo species, fights between red
kangaroo males tend to involve more wrestling.[29] Fights establish dominance relationships among males,
and determine who gets access to estrous females.[19] Dominant males make agonistic behaviours and more
sexual behaviours until they are overthrown. Displaced males live alone and avoid close contact with
others.[19]
Reproduction
The red kangaroo breeds all year round. The females have the
unusual ability to delay the birth of their baby until their previous
 joey has left the pouch. This is known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_diapause"] embryonic diapause.
Copulation may last 25 minutes.[29] The red kangaroo has the
typical reproductive system of a kangaroo. The neonate emerges
after only 33 days. Usually only one young is born at a time. It is
blind, hairless, and only a few centimetres long. Its hind legs are Two fighting male red kangaroos
mere stumps; it instead uses its more developed forelegs to climb its
way through the thick fur on its mother's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdomen"] abdomen into the pouch,
which takes about three to five minutes. Once in the pouch, it fastens onto one of the two teats and starts to
feed. Almost immediately, the mother's sexual cycle starts again. Another egg descends into the uterus and
she becomes sexually receptive. Then, if she mates and a second egg is fertilised, its development is
temporarily halted. Meanwhile, the neonate in the pouch grows rapidly. After approximately 190 days, the
baby (called a joey) is sufficiently large and developed to make its full emergence out of the pouch, after
sticking its head out for a few weeks until it eventually feels safe enough to fully emerge. From then on, it
spends increasing time in the outside world and eventually, after around 235 days, it leaves the pouch for
the last time.[30] While the young joey will permanently leave the pouch at around 235 days old, it will
continue to suckle until it reaches about 12 months of age. A doe may first reproduce as early as 18 months
of age and as late as five years during drought, but normally she is two and a half years old before she
begins to breed.[31]
The female red kangaroo is usually permanently [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"] pregnant except on the day she gives birth; however, she
has the ability to freeze the development of an embryo until the previous joey is able to leave the pouch.
This is known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_diapause"] embryonic diapause, and will occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food
sources. The composition of the milk produced by the mother varies according to the needs of the joey. In
addition, red kangaroo mothers may "have up to three generations of offspring simultaneously; a young-at-
foot suckling from an elongated teat, a young in the pouch attached to a second teat and a blastula in
arrested development in the uterus".[29]
Page 5
The red kangaroo has also been observed to engage in
 alloparental care, a behaviour in which a female may adopt
another female's joey. This is a common parenting behaviour
seen in many other animal species like wolves, elephants and
 fathead minnows.[32]
Relationship with humans
The red kangaroo is an abundant species and has even benefited
from the spread of agriculture and creation of man-made
waterholes. However, competition with livestock and rabbits
poses a threat. It is also sometimes shot by farmers as a pest,
although a "destruction permit" is required from the relevant state
government. 
A joey in a pouch at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden_Zoo"] Dresden Zoo

Kangaroos dazzled by headlights or startled by engine noise often
leap in front of vehicles, severely damaging or destroying smaller
or unprotected vehicles. The risk of harm to vehicle occupants is
greatly increased if the windscreen is the point of impact. As a
result, "kangaroo crossing" signs are commonplace in Australia.
Peak times for kangaroo/vehicle crashes are between 5:00 PM and
10:00 PM, in winter, and after extended dry-weather spells.[33]

Commercial use
Like all [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_wildlife"] Australian wildlife, the red kangaroo is protected by legislation, but it is so numerous that there is
regulated harvest of its hide and meat. Hunting permits and commercial harvesting are controlled under
nationally approved management plans, which aim to maintain red kangaroo populations and manage them
as a renewable resource. Harvesting of kangaroos is controversial, particularly due to the animal's
popularity.[31]
In the year 2000, 1,173,242 animals were killed.[34] In 2009 the government put a limit of 1,611,216 for
the number of red kangaroos available for commercial use. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_industry"] kangaroo industry is worth about [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar"] A$270
million each year, and employs over 4000 people.[35]The kangaroos provide meat for both humans and pet
food. Kangaroo meat is very lean with only about 2% fat. Their skins are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_leather"] used for leather.
