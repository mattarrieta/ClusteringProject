Southern hairy-nosed wombat
The southern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus latifrons) is
one of three extant species of wombats. It is found in scattered
 areas of semiarid scrub and mallee from the eastern Nullarbor
Plain to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales"] New South Wales border area. It is the smallest of all
three [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat"] wombat species. The young often do not survive dry
seasons. It is the state animal of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia"] South Australia.[3]
Among the oldest southern hairy-nosed wombats ever
documented were a male and a female from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookfield_Zoo"] Brookfield Zoo just
outside Chicago. Their names were Carver, who lived to be 34,
and his mother, Vicky, who lived to be 24.[4] In South Australia
in 2010, a domesticated wombat named Wally was also reported
as having reached the age of 34.[5] Hamlet, a wombat at the
 Toronto Zoo, similarly died at age 34.[6]

Description
Page 2
The southern hairy-nosed wombat is adapted to digging; it has a
stocky and robust build, flattened claws, and five digits.[8] It is
also plantigrade. The body length ranges from 772 to 934 mm
(30.4 to 36.8 in) with a body mass ranging from 19 to 32 kg (42
to 71 lb).[8] Its short tail is hidden by its fur. The pelage is silky
and is typically greyish or tan in colour. The wombat grooms
itself with its second and third toes, which are fused together,
except at the tips.[9][10] The head is robust and flattened and the
ears are pointed.[11] The snout resembles that of a pig.[9] The
animal gets its name from the hairs that cover its rhinarium.[8]
The wombat's incisors resemble those of rodents, and its molars
are widely spaced by the palate.[9] The teeth keep growing for 
Southern hairy-nosed wombat range
the entirety of the animal's life, which is likely an adaptation to
its harsh diet.[8] Compared to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_wombat"] common wombat, the southern hairy-nosed wombat has a larger
 temporalis muscle and a smaller [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masseter_muscle"] masseter muscle.[12] Also, unlike the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_hairy-nosed_wombat"] northern hairy-nosed wombat, the
southern hairy-nosed wombat's nasal bone is longer than the frontal bone.[8]
Distribution and habitat
Southern hairy-nosed wombats range though Western Australia, southern South Australia, and south-
western New South Wales. They live in semiarid to arid grasslands and woodlands.[11]
Feeding and energy 
Southern hairy-nosed wombats, along with other wombat
species, select native [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_plant"] perennial grasses and sedges, but do
consume [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_ecology#Introduced_species"] introduced pasture species, forbs, and the leaves of
woody shrubs if their favoured food is not available.[13] Much
of the southern hairy-nosed wombat's diet is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Austrostipa_nitida&action=edit&redlink=1"] Austrostipa nitida,
which grows around its warren complex and is trimmed as it
grazes.[13] This creates an area with a higher density of new
green shoots, a sign of delayed growth of individual grass.[9]
The teeth of the wombat are more effective in grinding food
Closeup of wombat lying down 
into small particles than the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_grey_kangaroo"] western grey kangaroo.[9] Its
digestive tract has a tiny [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caecum"] caecum and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colon_(anatomy)"] colon divided into
parts.[13] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior#Anterior_and_posterior"] anterior part is relatively small and serves as the
site for fermentation, while the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior#Anterior_and_posterior"] posterior part is larger and is where water is reabsorbed. The wombat
conserves water by recycling more [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea"] urea to the colon rather than releasing it as urine. Wombats release less
than other herbivorous mammals.[14] As such, the southern hairy-nosed wombat produces very dry faeces,
with water contents as low as 40%.[13]
The harsh environment in which the southern hairy-nosed wombat lives is further reflected in its energetics.
In captivity, their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_metabolic_rate"] standard metabolic rate was found to be 130 kl/kg^0.75 per day, which is very low
 compared to most placental animals and other marsupials.[14][15] They also have the lowest thyroid
hormone levels among mammals.[13] The food wombats eat provides more than enough energy.[14] As
long as enough food is available, the forage consumed by the wombat can support it during late lactation. It
is more effective than a donkey at maintaining its weight on low-quality food.[16]

Burrow system and activities
Southern hairy-nosed wombats dig and live in burrows which they connect into warrens with many
entrances. These warrens are their prime refuges and are shared by up to 10 individuals.[13] A wombat digs
with its fore claws while sitting up.[17] It leaves its new burrow backwards and pushes out soil with all its
paws.[17] The central warren is surrounded by a circle of small, simple burrows 100–150 m from it.[15] The
small burrows along the outer edges is where young wombats go when they are displaced from the central
warren.[13] Wombats may favour a certain burrow and not share it with others. However, there is no
monopolization of burrows.[18] Wombats move between burrows and even warrens. Male wombats are
territorial towards wombats from other warrens, possibly to defend food resources and the warren
refuges.[13] Trails of droppings connect the burrows. The males also mark their territory with anal scent
secretions by rubbing their backs and rumps on objects.[9] Fights between males over territories or mates do
occur and involve bites to the ears, flanks, or rumps.[8] Also, a dominance hierarchy exists among males.[8]
The burrows of a southern hairy-nosed wombat can have air
temperatures around of 14 °C in midwinter to 26 °C in
midsummer, the wombat's preferred thermo-neutral zone,
while the ambient temperatures outside range from down to
around 2 °C in Winter and up to 36 °C or above during
Summer.[19] Warrens can make surface conditions in habitats
of low humidity and high temperatures better for the
wombat.[19] A wombat retires deep in the burrow after
foraging.[15] The next night, the wombat moves to the
entrance to check if conditions are right before emerging
again.[15] In the evening, wombats leave their burrows as the
ambient temperature and burrow temperature are the same. In
the early morning, when the surface temperature is lower, they
retire.[20]

Mating and reproduction
The breeding of the southern hairy-nosed wombat occurs when their favoured food is at its peak growth
rates. Their reproduction relies on the winter rainfall, which germinates the grasses.[9] Between August and
October, when rainfall is sufficient, females enter ovulation and the males' testosterone levels and prostate
gland sizes increase. In years of low rainfall, neither occurs.[13] When breeding, dominance hierarchies
among males are established through aggression.[10] Copulation takes place in the warren, with males
remaining in one burrow and females moving among them. Mating takes place underground and involves
the male mounting the female from behind while she is on her side.[18] The gestation period of the wombat
lasts 22 days and most births occur in October. When a young is born, it climbs into the pouch and clings to
a teat. It stays in the pouch for six months growing to around 0.45 kg, with a light pelage and open
eyes.[13] It soon leaves the pouch and starts grazing at the surface. The young is fully weaned when it is a
year old and reaches full size at the age of three years,[13] which is also when it becomes sexually
mature.[8]
Communication
Southern hairy-nosed wombats use vocalisations and scents for communication. While most
communication between wombats occurs through olfaction and scent-marking, as they do not often
encounter each other directly,[8] they emit rough, coughing noises when they pass each other, and emit a
Page 4
more strident call for alarm.[9]
Conservation status 
The southern hairy-nosed wombat was listed as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_Threatened"] Near Threatened
by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN"] IUCN in 2016, because "many subpopulations are now
 isolated and may be non-viable". It was previously listed as Least
 Concern because "While there are sporadic outbreaks of sarcoptic
mange, competition with introduced herbivores, susceptibility to
drought, and severe fragmentation in parts of its range, the species
has a wide distribution, large population, occurs in a number of
protected areas, and it is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate
Illustration by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Wolf"] Joseph Wolf (1865) required to qualify for listing in a threatened category".[2] Wombats
were hunted by aboriginal people for their meat. However,
capturing a wombat takes considerable time and energy, so they
were not hunted too frequently.[21] The indigenous people of Australia value the wombat culturally and
keep their local wombat populations healthy by hunting wombats in other areas.[21]
Wombats have been considered as agricultural pests by landholders.[22] Their digging can destroy crops
and can increase the risk of livestock breaking their legs by falling through their burrow systems.[23]
Competition between livestock, rabbits, and wombats can lead to overgrazing. Overgrazing and the spread
of invasive weeds in some areas has led to the flora being dominated by annual grass and weed species,
from which wombats cannot get enough of their metabolic needs, resulting in reports of emaciation and
mass starvation.[8][24] The competition from introduced rabbits threatens the survival of wombats.[8]
