Northern hairy-nosed wombat
The northern hairy-nosed wombat (Lasiorhinus krefftii, NHN)
or yaminon is one of three extant species of Australian
 marsupials known as wombats. It is one of the rarest land
 mammals in the world and is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species"] critically endangered. Its historical
range extended across [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales"] New South Wales, Victoria, and
 Queensland as recently as 100 years ago, but it is now restricted
to one place, a 3 km2 (1.2 sq mi) range within the 32 km2
(12 sq mi) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epping_Forest_National_Park"] Epping Forest National Park in Queensland. With the
species threatened by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_dog"] wild dogs, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Government"] Queensland Government
built a 20-kilometre (12 mi)-long predator-proof fence around all
wombat habitat at Epping Forest National Park in 2002.

In 2003, the total population consisted of 113 individuals,
including only around 30 breeding females. After recording an
estimated 230 individuals in 2015, the number was up to over
300 by 2021.

Taxonomy
English naturalist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Owen"] Richard Owen described the species in 1873.
The genus name Lasiorhinus comes from the Latin words lasios,
meaning hairy or shaggy, and rhinus, meaning nose.[4][3] The
widely accepted common name is northern hairy-nosed wombat,
based on the historical range of the species, as well as the fur, or
"whiskers", on its nose. In some older literature, it is referred to
as the Queensland hairy-nosed wombat.[5]

The northern hairy-nosed wombat shares its genus with one
other extant species, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_hairy-nosed_wombat"] southern hairy-nosed wombat, while the
 common wombat is in the genus Vombatus. Both Lasiorhinus
species differ morphologically from the common wombat by
their silkier fur, broader hairy noses, and longer ears.[6]
Description
In general, all species of wombat are heavily built, with large
heads and short, powerful legs. They have strong claws to dig
their burrows, where they live much of the time. It usually takes
about a day for an individual to dig a burrow. 
Northern hairy-nosed wombat range
Northern hairy-nosed wombats have bodies covered in soft, grey fur; the fur on their noses sets them apart
from the common wombat. They have longer, more pointed ears and a much broader muzzle than the other
two species.[7] Individuals can be 35 cm high, up to 1 m long and weigh up to 40 kg. The species exhibits
sexual dimorphism, with females being somewhat larger than males due to the presence of an extra layer of
fat. They are slightly larger than the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_wombat"] common wombat and able to breed somewhat faster (giving birth to
two young every three years on average).
The northern hairy-nosed wombat's nose is very important in its survival because it has very poor eyesight,
so it must detect its food in the dark through smell. Examination of the wombat's digestive tract shows that
the elastic properties of the ends of their large intestines are capable of turning liquid excrement into cubical
scat.[8]
Distribution and habitat
Northern hairy-nosed wombats require deep sandy soils in which to dig their burrows, and a year-round
supply of grass, which is their primary food. These areas usually occur in open [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalypt"] eucalypt woodlands.[3]
At Epping Forest National Park, northern hairy-nosed wombats construct their burrows in deep, sandy soils
on levée banks which were deposited by a creek that no longer flows through the area. They forage in
areas of heavy [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay"] clay soils adjacent to the sandy soils, but do not dig burrows in these areas, which become
waterlogged in the wet seasons. In the park, burrows are often associated with native [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhina"] bauhina trees
(Lysiphyllum hookeri). This tree has a spreading growth form, and its roots probably provide stability for
the extensive burrows dug by the wombats.[3]
The range of the northern hairy-nosed wombat is restricted to about 300 hectares (740 acres) of the Epping
National Forest in east-central Queensland, 120 kilometres (75 mi) north-west of Clermont.[9]
Behaviour
The northern hairy-nosed wombat is nocturnal, living underground in networks of burrows. They avoid
coming above ground during harsh weather, as their burrows maintain a constant humidity and
temperature.[10] They have been known to share burrows with up to 10 individuals, equally divided by sex.
Young are usually born during the wet season, between November and April. When rain is abundant, 50-
80% of the females in the population will breed, giving birth to one offspring at a time. Juveniles stay in
their mothers' pouches for 8 to 9 months, and are weaned at 12 months of age.[11]
Page 3
The fat reserves and low metabolic rate of this species permit northern hairy-nosed wombats to go without
food for several days when food is scarce. Even when they do feed every day, it is only for 6 hours a day in
the winter and 2 hours in the summer, significantly less than a similar-sized kangaroo, which feeds for at
least 18 hours a day. Their diet consists of native grasses: black speargrass ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteropogon_contortus"] Heteropogon contortus), bottle
washer grasses ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneapogon"] Enneapogon spp.),  golden beard grass ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chrysopogon_fallax&action=edit&redlink=1"] Chrysopogon fallax),  and three-awned
grass([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristida"] Aristida spp.), as well as various types of roots. The teeth continue to grow beyond the juvenile
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenchrus_ciliaris"] period, and are worn down by the abrasive grasses they eat.. Its habitat has become infested with African
buffel grass, a grass species introduced for cattle grazing. The grass outcompetes the more nutritional and
native grasses on which the wombat prefers to feed by limiting its quantity, forcing the wombat to travel
further to find the native grasses it prefers, and leading to a reduction in biomass.[12]
Conservation
Status
The conservation status of the northern hairy-nosed wombat is as follows:[3]
 Critically Endangered, per [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN"] IUCN (as of 2021; last assessed 15 June 2015),[2][3]
 Critically Endangered, under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity
Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act);[3] and
 Critically Endangered, under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Conservation_Act_1992"] Nature Conservation Act 1992 (Qld).[3]
On 15 February 2018, the federal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Environment_and_Energy"] Department of the Environment and Energy (DoEE) upgraded the
conservation status from Endangered to Critically Endangered under the EPBC Act to better align with the
International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.[3] Due to its
status under the EPBC Act, it is listed on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_Profile_and_Threats_Database"] Species Profile and Threats Database (SPRAT).[13]
Threats
 Originally there were two main groups of hairy-nosed wombats (the other being the Southern hairy-nosed
wombat, Lasiorhinus latifrons) that were separated by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Gulf"] Spencer Gulf in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia"] South Australia. Both species
experienced a population decline between 1870 and 1920, with the main influences being culling by
agriculturalists, competition for food with introduced and feral species and predation. Threats to the
northern hairy-nosed wombat include small population size, predation, competition for food, disease,
floods, droughts, wildfires, and habitat loss. Its small, highly localised population makes the species
especially vulnerable to natural disasters.[14] Wild dogs are the wombat's primary predator, but the spread of
rabbits and the actions of landowners have also contributed to their decline.[15]
There have been two reports of male northern hairy-nosed wombats contracting a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungal"] fungal infection caused
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmonsia_parva"] Emmonsia parva, a soil [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saprophytic"] saprophytic fungus. It is likely that the northern hairy-nosed wombats are
inhaling the infection from the soil.[16]
Counter-measures
To combat the vulnerability of this species, a number of conservation projects have been put into action in
the 21st century. One example was the construction of a two-metre-high, predator-proof fence around 20-
kilometre (12 mi) of the park in 2000.[3] A second, insurance colony of this species of wombat was
Page 4
 established at Richard Underwood Nature Refuge at Yarran Downs, near Tallon (a small town near St
George) in southern Queensland in 2008. The reserve is surrounded by a predator-proof fence.[17]
In 2006, researchers performed a study to analyse the demography of the northern hairy-nosed wombat, by
using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-sided_tape"] double-sided tape in the burrows to collect hair of the wombats. Through [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_analysis"] DNA analysis, they found
that the ratio of female to male wombats was 1:2.25 in the population of approximately 113 wombats.
These findings allowed researchers to understand the demographics of this species, and opened up further
research to better understand why there is a significant difference in males and females in the wild.[10]
Within Epping Forest National Park, increased attention and funds have been given for wombat research
and population monitoring, fire management, maintenance of the predator-proof fence, general
management, and control of predators and competitors, and elimination of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_plant"] invasive plant species.[18] In
addition, the species recovery plan of 2004 to 2008 included communication and community involvement
in saving the species, and worked to increase the current population in the wild, established other
populations within the wombat's historical range, and worked with zoos to establish a captive husbandry
program. There is also a volunteer caretaker program, that allows volunteers to contribute in monitoring the
population and keeping the predator fence in good repair. In addition, DNA fingerprint identification of
wombat hairs allows research to be conducted without an invasive trapping or radio-tracking program.[19]
Population increases
Due to the combined efforts of these forces, the northern hairy-nosed wombat population has been slowly
making a comeback.[20]
In 2003, the total population consisted of 113 individuals, including only around 30 breeding
females.[21]
In the last census taken in 2013, the estimated population was 196 individuals, with an
additional 9 individuals at the Richard Underwood Nature Refuge at Yarran Downs.[22]
In 2016 the population was estimated to be 250 individuals.[22]
In May 2021, researchers found that the population had increased to over 300 individuals.[9]
