Common wombat
The common wombat (Vombatus ursinus), also known as the
coarse-haired wombat or bare-nosed wombat, is a marsupial,
one of three extant [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"] species of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat"] wombats and the only one in the
 genus Vombatus. The common wombat grows to an average of
98 cm (39 in) long and a weight of 26 kg (57 lb).

The common wombat was first described by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Shaw_(biologist)"] George Shaw in
1800. There are three extant subspecies:
Bass Strait (common) wombat (V. u. ursinus), the
 nominate form, was once found throughout the Bass
Strait Islands, but is now restricted to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Island"] Flinders Island
to the north of Tasmania.[4] Its population was
estimated at 4,000 in 1996 and is listed as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species"] vulnerable
 by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity
Conservation Act 1999 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List"] IUCN Red List.[5][6]

Tasmanian wombat (V. u. tasmaniensis) is found in
Tasmania.[4][7] It is smaller than V. u. hirsutus.[8]
 Hackett's wombat (V. hacketti) is an extinct species of genus
Vombatus,  inhabiting the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Australia"] southwestern part of
Australia.[9][10][11][12] Being around the same size as V. ursinus,
with an average weight of 30 kg, V. hacketti went extinct at the
 end of the Late Pleistocene, in the Quaternary extinction
event.[13][14]
Description
Common wombats are sturdy and built close to the ground.
When fully grown, they can reach between 80 and 130 cm, and
weigh between 17 and 40 kg. The wombats found on Tasmania
and Flinders Island are often [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_dwarfism"] smaller than their mainland
counterparts. It is distinguished from both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairy-nosed_wombat"] hairy-nosed wombats
by its bald nose.

Common wombats are widespread in the cooler and better-watered
parts of southern and eastern Australia, including Tasmania, and in
mountain districts as far north as the south of Queensland, but is
declining in western [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)"] Victoria and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia"] South Australia.
Common wombats can be found at any elevation in the south of their range, but in the north of their range
are only found in higher, more mountainous areas. They may be found in a variety of habitats including
rainforest, eucalyptus forest, woodland, alpine grassland, and coastal areas. In some regions, they have
adapted to farmland and can even be seen grazing in open fields with cattle and sheep.
Behaviour
Common wombats are a solitary, territorial species, with each wombat having an established range in
which it lives and feeds. In this area, they dig a tunnel system, with tunnels ranging from 2 to 20 m in
length, along with many side tunnels. Usually, only one entrance to the burrow exists, although they may
create a smaller one with which to escape.
Recent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Australian_bushfire_season"] bushfires in Australia's Eastern and South Eastern areas showed that burrows are frequently much
longer than originally thought, with some having over 20 entrances and that many wombat burrows were
used by other species including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-wallaby"] rock wallaby and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp_wallaby"] swamp wallaby, to shelter from the bushfires. It
Page 3
was not clear whether this was with the approval of the "owner" or whether sheltering species had found
an unpopulated burrow.
Many wombats can live in the same burrow, and wombats normally live in the same burrow for their whole
lifespan unless the wombat is forced out of the burrow by farmers or other animal species, or unless the
burrow is destroyed. Often nocturnal, the common wombat does come out during the day in cooler
weather, such as in early morning or late afternoon.[15]
Diet
Common wombats are herbivorous, subsisting on grass, snow
tussocks, and other plant materials. Foraging is usually done during
the night. They are the only marsupial in the world whose teeth
constantly grow which allows them to maintain a diet consisting of
mainly native grasses.[15]
Breeding 
A wombat grazing in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Island"] Maria Island,
The common wombat can [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeding_in_the_wild"] breed every two years and produce a  Australia
single joey. The gestation period is about 20–30 days, and the
young remain in the pouch for five months. When leaving the
pouch, they weigh between 3.5 and 6.5 kg (7.7 and 14.3 lb). The joey is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaning"] weaned around 12 to 15 months
of age, and is usually independent at 18 months of age.[15] Wombats have an average lifespan of 15 years
in the wild and 20 years in captivity.
