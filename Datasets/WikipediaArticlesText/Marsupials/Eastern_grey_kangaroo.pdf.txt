Eastern grey kangaroo
The eastern grey kangaroo (Macropus giganteus)  is a
 marsupial found in the eastern third of Australia, with a
population of several million. It is also known as the great grey
kangaroo and the forester kangaroo. Although a big eastern
grey male typically weighs around 66 kg (146 lb) and stands
almost 2 m (6 ft 7 in) tall, the scientific name, Macropus
giganteus (gigantic large-foot), is misleading: the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_kangaroo"] red kangaroo
of the semi-arid inland is larger, weighing up to 90 kg (200 lb).

The eastern grey kangaroo is the second largest and heaviest
living marsupial and native land mammal in Australia. An adult
male will commonly weigh around 50 to 66 kg (110 to 146 lb)
whereas females commonly weigh around 17 to 40 kg (37 to
88 lb). They have a powerful tail that is over 1 m long in adult
males.[4] Large males of this species are more heavily built and
muscled than the lankier red kangaroo and can occasionally
exceed normal dimensions. One of these, shot in eastern
 Tasmania weighed 82 kg (181 lb), with a 2.64 m (8.7 ft) total
length from nose to tail (possibly along the curves). The largest
known specimen, examined by Lydekker, had a weight of 91 kg
(201 lb) and measured 2.92 m (9.6 ft) along the curves. When
the skin of this specimen was measured it had a "flat" length of
2.49 m (8.2 ft).[5]
The eastern grey is easy to recognise: its soft grey coat is
distinctive, and it is usually found in moister, more fertile areas than
the red. Red kangaroos, though sometimes grey-blue in colour,
have a totally different face than eastern grey kangaroos. Red
kangaroos have distinctive markings in black and white beside their
muzzles and along the sides of their face. Eastern grey kangaroos
do not have these markings, and their eyes seem large and wide
open.
Where their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(biology)"] ranges overlap, it is much more difficult to distinguish
between eastern grey and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_grey_kangaroo"] western grey kangaroos, which are
closely related. They have a very similar body and facial structure,
and their muzzles are fully covered with fine hair (though that is not
obvious at a distance, their noses do look noticeably different from
the noses of reds and wallaroos). The eastern grey's colouration is a
light-coloured grey or brownish-grey, with a lighter silver or cream,
sometimes nearly white, belly. The western grey is a dark dusty
brown colour, with more contrast especially around the head.[6]
 Indigenous Australian names include iyirrbir ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uw_Oykangand_language"] Uw Oykangand and
 Uw Olkola) and kucha (Pakanh). The highest ever recorded speed
of any kangaroo was 64 kilometres per hour (40 mph) set by a
large female eastern grey kangaroo.[7]

usually only a short drive to the remaining pockets of near-city bushland where kangaroos can be found
without much difficulty. The eastern grey prefers open grassland with areas of bush for daytime shelter and
mainly inhabits the wetter parts of Australia.[8] It also inhabits [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal"] coastal areas, woodlands, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-tropical"] sub-tropical
forests, mountain forests, and inland scrubs.[8]
Like all kangaroos, it is mainly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal"] nocturnal and crepuscular,[6] and is mostly seen early in the morning, or as
the light starts to fade in the evening.[9] In the middle of the day, kangaroos rest in the cover of the
woodlands and eat there but then come out in the open to feed on the grasslands in large numbers.[6] The
eastern grey kangaroo is predominantly a grazer, eating a wide variety of grasses, whereas some other
species (e.g. the red kangaroo) include significant amounts of shrubs in their diet.
Behaviour
Eastern grey kangaroos are gregarious and form open-membership
groups.[10] The groups contain an average of three individuals.[9]
Smaller groups join together to graze in preferred foraging areas,
and to rest in large groups around the middle of the day.[9] They
exist in a dominance hierarchy and the dominant individuals gain
access to better sources of food and areas of shade.[6] However,
kangaroos are not territorial.Eastern grey kangaroos adjust their
behaviour in relation to the risk of predation with reproductive
females, individuals on the periphery of the group and individuals
in groups far from cover being the most vigilant.[10] Vigilance in
individual kangaroos does not seem to significantly decrease when
the size of the group increases. However, there is a tendency for the
proportion of individuals on the periphery of the group to decline as
group size increases.[10] The open membership of the group allows
more kangaroos to join and thus provide more buffers against
predators.[10]

Females may form strong kinship bonds with their relatives.
Females with living female relatives have a greater chance of
reproducing.[11] Most kangaroo births occur during the summer.[12]
Eastern grey kangaroos are obligate breeders in that they can only
reproduce in one kind of habitat.[13]
The female eastern grey kangaroo is usually permanently [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy"] pregnant

to leave the pouch. This is known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_diapause"] embryonic diapause, and will
occur in times of drought and in areas with poor food sources. The composition of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk"] milk produced by
the mother varies according to the needs of the joey. In addition, the mother is able to produce two different
kinds of milk simultaneously for the newborn and the older joey still in the pouch.Unusually, during a dry
period, males will not produce sperm, and females will only conceive if there has been enough rain to
produce a large quantity of green vegetation.[14] Females take care of the young without any assistance
from the males. The joeys are heavily reliant on their mothers for about 550 days, which is when they are
weaned. Females [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_mature"] sexually mature between 17 and 28 months, while males mature at around 25 months.[8]

Status
It is popularly thought, but not confirmed by evidence,[15][16] that
kangaroo populations have increased significantly since the
European colonisation of Australia because of the increased areas
of grassland (as distinct from forest),  the reduction in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingo"] dingo
numbers, and the availability of artificial watering holes. The
estimated population of the species Australia-wide in 2010 was
11.4 million.[17] In some places the eastern grey is so numerous it
causes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overgrazing"] overgrazing and some individual populations have been
 culled in some parts of Australia (see, for example, the Eden Park
Kangaroo Cull).[18][19][20] Despite the commercial harvest and
some culls, the eastern grey remains common and widespread.
Eastern greys are common in suburban and rural areas where they
have been observed to form larger groups than in natural areas.[21]
It still covers the entire range it occupied when Europeans arrived
in Australia in 1788[22] and it often comes into conflict with
agriculture as it uses the more fertile districts that now carry crops
or exotic pasture grasses, which kangaroos readily eat.[23]
Kangaroo meat has also been considered to replace beef in recent
years, as their soft feet are preferable to hooves in erosion prone
areas.[24]
