Thylacine
The thylacine ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈθaɪləsiːn/ [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key"] THY-lə-seen,[14] or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈθaɪləsaɪn/
 THY-lə-syne,[15] also [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈθaɪləsɪn/)[16] (Thylacinus
cynocephalus) is an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct"] extinct [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivorous_marsupial"] carnivorous marsupial that was
native to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_Australia"] Australian mainland and the islands of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania"] Tasmania
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea"] New Guinea.[17] The last known live animal was
captured in 1930 in Tasmania. It is commonly known as the
Tasmanian tiger (because of its striped lower back) or the
Tasmanian wolf (because of its canid-like characteristics).
Various [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Tasmanians"] Aboriginal Tasmanian names have been recorded,
such as coorinna, kanunnah, cab-berr-one-nen-er, loarinna,
laoonana, can-nen-ner and lagunta,[18][19] while kaparunina

Thylacine[1]
Temporal range: Pleistocene–
Holocene,
The thylacine was relatively shy and nocturnal, with the
general appearance of a medium-to-large-size canid, except
for its stiff tail and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pouch_(marsupial)"] abdominal pouch similar to that of a
kangaroo. Because of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution"] convergent evolution, it displayed an
anatomy and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptations"] adaptations similar to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger"] tiger (Panthera tigris)
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf"] wolf (Canis lupus) of the Northern Hemisphere, such as
dark transverse stripes that radiated from the top of its back,
and a skull shape extremely similar to those of canids, despite
 being unrelated. The thylacine was a formidable apex
predator,[6] though exactly how large its prey animals were is
disputed. Its closest living relatives are the other members of
Dasyuromorphia, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_devil"] Tasmanian devil and quolls.
The thylacine was one of only two marsupials known to have
a pouch in both sexes: the other (still extant) species is the
 water opossum from Central and South America. The pouch
of the male thylacine served as a protective sheath, covering
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupial_reproductive_system"] external reproductive organs.
The thylacine had become [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_extinct"] locally extinct on both New
Guinea and the Australian mainland before [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Australia_before_1901"] British settlement
of the continent, but its last stronghold was on the island of
Tasmania, along with several other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(ecology)"] endemic species,
including the Tasmanian devil. Intensive hunting encouraged
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_(reward)"] bounties is generally blamed for its extinction, but other
contributing factors may have been disease, the introduction
of dogs, and human encroachment into its habitat.

By the time the first European explorers arrived, the animal
was already extinct in mainland Australia and New Guinea,
and rare in Tasmania. Europeans may have encountered it in
Tasmania as far back as 1642, when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Tasman"] Abel Tasman first 
Thylacinus rostralis De Vis,
1893[13]
arrived in Tasmania. His shore party reported seeing the footprints of "wild beasts having claws like a
Tyger".[23] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc-Joseph_Marion_du_Fresne"] Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne, arriving with the Mascarin in 1772, reported seeing a "tiger
Page 3
cat".[24] Positive identification of the thylacine as the animal
encountered cannot be made from this report, since the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_quoll"] tiger quoll
(Dasyurus maculatus) is similarly described.
The first definitive encounter was by French explorers on 13 May
1792, as noted by the naturalist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Labillardi%C3%A8re"] Jacques Labillardière, in his journal
 from the expedition led by d'Entrecasteaux. In 1805, William
Paterson, the Lieutenant Governor of Tasmania, sent a detailed
description for publication in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Gazette"] Sydney Gazette.[25] He also sent a
description of the thylacine in a letter to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Banks"] Joseph Banks, dated 30
March 1805.[26]
The first detailed scientific description was made by Tasmania's
Deputy Surveyor-General, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Prideaux_Robert_Harris"] George Harris, in 1808, five years after
first European settlement of the island.[5][27][28] Harris originally
placed the thylacine in the genus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didelphis"] Didelphis,  which had been
created by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus"] Linnaeus for the American opossums, describing it as
Didelphis cynocephala, the "dog-headed opossum". Recognition
that the Australian marsupials were fundamentally different from
the known mammal genera led to the establishment of the modern
classification scheme, and in 1796, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tienne_Geoffroy_Saint-Hilaire"] Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire created
the genus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasyurus"] Dasyurus where he placed the thylacine in 1810. To

resolve the mixture of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"] Greek and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"] Latin nomenclature, the species
name was altered to cynocephalus. In 1824, it was separated out into its own genus, Thylacinus,  by
Temminck.[29] The common name derives directly from the genus name, originally from the Greek
θύλακος (thýlakos), meaning "pouch" or "sack".[30][a]
Evolution
The modern thylacine probably appeared about 2 million years ago, during
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Pleistocene"] Early Pleistocene. Specimens from the Pliocene-aged Chinchilla Fauna,
described as Thylacinus rostralis by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_De_Vis"] Charles De Vis in 1894, have in the
past been suggested to represent Thylacinus cynocephalus, but have been
shown to either have been curatorial errors, or ambiguous in their specific
attribution.[32][33] The family [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thylacinidae"] Thylacinidae includes at least 12 species in
eight genera,[34] and appears around the late [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligocene"] Oligocene with the small,
plesiomorphic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badjcinus"] Badjcinus turnbulli.[35] Early thylacinids were quoll-sized,
well under 10 kg (22 lb), and probably ate insects and small reptiles and
mammals, although signs of an increasingly-carnivorous diet can be seen as
early as the early [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene"] Miocene in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabulacinus_ridei"] Wabulacinus.[34] Members of the genus
Thylacinus are notable for a dramatic increase in both the expression of
 carnivorous dental traits and in size, with the largest species, Thylacinus
potens and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thylacinus_megiriani"] Thylacinus megiriani both approaching the size of a wolf.[34] In
 Late Pleistocene and early [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene"] Holocene times, the modern thylacine was
widespread (although never numerous) throughout Australia and New
Guinea.[36]
A classic example of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution"] convergent evolution, the thylacine showed many
similarities to the members of the dog family, Canidae, of the Northern
Hemisphere: sharp teeth, powerful jaws, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digitigrade"] raised heels, and the same general
body form. Since the thylacine filled the same [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_niche"] ecological niche in Australia 
The skulls of the thylacine
(left) and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_wolf"] grey wolf
(Canis lupus) are quite
similar, although the species
are not related. Studies
show that the skull shape of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox"] red fox (Vulpes vulpes),
is even closer to that of the
thylacine.[31]
Page 4
and New Guinea as canids did elsewhere, it developed many of the same features. Despite this, as a
marsupial, it is unrelated to any of the Northern Hemisphere [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placentalia"] placental mammal predators.[37]
They are easy to tell from a true dog because of the stripes on the back but the skeleton is
harder to distinguish. Zoology students at Oxford had to identify 100 zoological specimens as
part of the final exam. Word soon got around that, if ever a 'dog' skull was given, it was safe to
identify it as Thylacinus on the grounds that anything as obvious as a dog skull had to be a
catch. Then one year the examiners, to their credit, double bluffed and put in a real dog skull.
The easiest way to tell the difference is by the two prominent holes in the palate bone, which
are characteristic of marsupials generally.[38]

Description
The only recorded species of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thylacinus"] Thylacinus, a genus that superficially
resembles the dogs and foxes of the family Canidae, the animal was
a predatory marsupial that existed on mainland Australia during the
Holocene epoch and observed by Europeans on the island of
Tasmania; the species is known as the Tasmanian tiger for the
striped markings of the pelage. Descriptions of the thylacine come
from preserved specimens, fossil records, skins and skeletal
remains, and black and white photographs and film of the animal
both in captivity and from the field. The thylacine resembled a
large, short-haired dog with a stiff tail which smoothly extended
from the body in a way similar to that of a kangaroo.[37] The
mature thylacine ranged from 100 to 130 cm (39 to 51 in) long,
plus a tail of around 50 to 65 cm (20 to 26 in).[40] Adults stood
about 60 cm (24 in) at the shoulder and on average weighed 12 to
22 kg (26 to 49 lb), though they could range anywhere from 8 to

30 kg (18 to 66 lb).[41] There was slight [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"] sexual dimorphism with the males being larger than females on
average.[42] Males weighed in at around 19.7 kilograms (43 lb), and females weighed in at around 13.7
kilograms (30 lb).[41][43] The skull is noted to be highly convergent on those of canids, most closely
remembling that of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox"] red fox.[44]
Thylacines, uniquely for marsupials, had largely cartilaginous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epipubic"] epipubic bones with a highly reduced
osseous element.[45][46] This has been once considered a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapomorphy"] synapomorphy with sparassodonts,[47] though it
is now thought that both groups reduced their epipubics independently. Its yellow-brown coat featured 15
to 20 distinctive dark stripes across its back, rump and the base of its tail,[48] which earned the animal the
nickname "tiger". The stripes were more pronounced in younger specimens, fading as the animal got
older.[48] One of the stripes extended down the outside of the rear thigh. Its body hair was dense and soft,
up to 15 mm (0.6 in) in length. Colouration varied from light fawn to a dark brown; the belly was cream-
coloured.[49]
Its rounded, erect ears were about 8 cm (3.1 in) long and covered with short fur.[50] The early scientific
studies suggested it possessed an acute sense of smell which enabled it to track prey,[51] but analysis of its
brain structure revealed that its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_bulb"] olfactory bulbs were not well developed. It is likely to have relied on sight
and sound when hunting instead.[48]
The thylacine was able to open its jaws to an unusual extent: up to 80 degrees.[52] This capability can be
seen in part in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fleay"] David Fleay's short black-and-white film sequence of a captive thylacine from 1933. The
jaws were muscular, and had 46 teeth, but studies show the thylacine jaw was too weak to kill
sheep.[50][53][54] The tail vertebrae were fused to a degree, with resulting restriction of full tail movement.
Fusion may have occurred as the animal reached full maturity. The tail tapered towards the tip. In juveniles,
the tip of the tail had a ridge.[55] The female thylacine had a pouch with four teats, but unlike many other
marsupials, the pouch opened to the rear of its body. Males had a scrotal pouch, unique amongst the
Australian marsupials,[56] into which they could withdraw their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"] scrotal sac for protection.[48]
Thylacine footprints could be distinguished from other native or introduced
animals; unlike foxes, cats, dogs, wombats, or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_devil"] Tasmanian devils, thylacines had
a very large rear pad and four obvious front pads, arranged in almost a straight
line.[51] The hindfeet were similar to the forefeet but had four digits rather than
five. Their claws were non-retractable.[48] More detail can be seen in a cast
taken from a freshly dead thylacine. The cast shows the plantar pad in more
detail and shows that the plantar pad is tri-lobal in that it exhibits three
distinctive lobes. It is a single plantar pad divided by three deep grooves. The
distinctive plantar pad shape along with the asymmetrical nature of the foot
makes it quite different from animals such as dogs or foxes. This cast dates back
to the early 1930s and is part of the Museum of Victoria's thylacine
collection.[57] 
The thylacine's
footprint is easy to
distinguish from those
of native and
introduced species.
The thylacine was noted as having a stiff and somewhat awkward gait, making
it unable to run at high speed. It could also perform a bipedal hop, in a fashion
similar to a kangaroo—demonstrated at various times by captive specimens.[48] Guiler speculates that this
was used as an accelerated form of motion when the animal became alarmed.[49] The animal was also able
to balance on its hind legs and stand upright for brief periods.[58]
Observers of the animal in the wild and in captivity noted that it would growl and hiss when agitated, often
accompanied by a threat-yawn. During hunting, it would emit a series of rapidly repeated guttural cough-
like barks (described as "yip-yap", "cay-yip" or "hop-hop-hop"), probably for communication between the
family pack members. It also had a long whining cry, probably for identification at distance, and a low
snuffling noise used for communication between family members.[59] Some observers described it as
Page 6
having a strong and distinctive smell, others described a faint, clean, animal odour, and some no odour at
all. It is possible that the thylacine, like its relative, the Tasmanian devil, gave off an odour when
agitated.[60]
Distribution and habitat
 The thylacine most likely preferred the dry eucalyptus forests, wetlands, and grasslands of mainland
Australia.[51] Indigenous Australian rock paintings indicate that the thylacine lived throughout mainland
Australia and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea"] New Guinea. Proof of the animal's existence in mainland Australia came from a desiccated
carcass that was discovered in a cave in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nullarbor_Plain"] Nullarbor Plain in Western Australia in 1990; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dating"] carbon dating
revealed it to be around 3,300 years old.[61] Recently examined fossilised footprints also suggest historical
distribution of the species on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Island"] Kangaroo Island.[62] The northernmost record of the species is from the
Kiowa rock shelter in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimbu_Province"] Chimbu Province in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea_Highlands"] highlands of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea"] Papua New Guinea, dating to the Early
Holocene, ~10,000-8,500 years Before Present.[63]
In Tasmania it preferred the woodlands of the midlands and coastal heath, which eventually became the
primary focus of British settlers seeking grazing land for their livestock.[64] The striped pattern may have
provided camouflage in woodland conditions,[48] but it may have also served for identification
purposes.[65] The animal had a typical home range of between 40 and 80 km2 (15 and 31 sq mi).[49] It
appears to have kept to its home range without being territorial; groups too large to be a family unit were
sometimes observed together.[66]
Ecology and behaviour
Little is known about the behaviour of the thylacine. A few
observations were made of the animal in captivity, but only limited,
anecdotal evidence exists of the animal's behaviour in the wild.
Most observations were made during the day, whereas the thylacine
was naturally nocturnal. Those observations, made in the twentieth
century, may have been atypical, as they were of a species already
under the stresses that would soon lead to its extinction. Some
behavioural characteristics have been extrapolated from the
behaviour of its close relative, the Tasmanian devil.
The thylacine was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_animal"] nocturnal and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular"] crepuscular hunter, spending the
daylight hours in small caves or hollow tree trunks in a nest of
twigs, bark, or fern fronds. It tended to retreat to the hills and forest
for shelter during the day. and hunted in the open heath at night.
Early observers noted that the animal was typically shy and
secretive, with awareness of the presence of humans and generally
avoiding contact, though it occasionally showed inquisitive
traits.[67] At the time, much stigma existed in regard to its "fierce"
nature; this is likely to be due to its perceived threat to
agriculture.[68]

There is evidence for at least some year-round breeding (cull
records show joeys discovered in the pouch at all times of the year),
although the peak breeding season was in winter and spring.[48]
They would produce up to four joeys per litter (typically two or
three), carrying the young in a pouch for up to three months and
protecting them until they were at least half adult size. Early pouch
young were hairless and blind, but they had their eyes open and
were fully furred by the time they left the pouch.[48] After leaving
the pouch, and until they were developed enough to assist, the
juveniles would remain in the lair while their mother hunted.[69] 
Thylacine family at Beaumaris Zoo in
Hobart, 1910
 Thylacines only once bred successfully in captivity, in Melbourne
Zoo in 1899.[70] Their life expectancy in the wild is estimated to
have been 5 to 7 years, although captive specimens survived up to 9 years.[51]
In 2018, Newton et al. collected and CT-scanned all known preserved thylacine pouch young specimens to
digitally reconstruct its development throughout its entire window of growth in the mother's pouch. This
study revealed new information on the biology of the thylacine, including the growth of its limbs and when
it developed its 'dog-like' appearance. It was found that two of the thylacine young in the Tasmanian
Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG) were misidentified and of another species, reducing the number of
known pouch young specimens to 11 worldwide.[71]
Feeding and diet 
The thylacine was exclusively carnivorous. In captivity, thylacines
had a clear preference for birds (particularly chickens). In the wild,
large ground-dwelling birds (such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_nativehen"] Tasmanian nativehens) may
have been their primary prey, since they are documented to have
hunted a wide range of them, and its comparatively moderate bite
force was more suited to hollow avian bones. During its peak
occupation of the mainland, such prey would have been bountiful,
and studies of their Pliestocene habitat points to a more suitable diet
 consisting of a range of megapodes (such as the Giant
malleefowl)[72] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratite"] ratites (such as the emu),  and possibly
 dromornithids (most of which extinct prior to European settlement).
At the time of European settlement, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_emu"] Tasmanian emu, a
subspecies believed to be smaller than mainland emus, was
1887 illustration of an emu being
chased by two thylacines 
common and widespread and Thylacines were known to prey on
them and share the same habitat.[73] Many early depictions of them
hunting included emu. The large, flightless bird was hunted to
extinction by humans within 30 years of European settlement. The
extinction correlates with a rapid decline in thylacine numbers.[74][75][76] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassowary"] Cassowary species of northern
Australia and New Guinea coexisted with the Thylacine, but had developed strong defenses against
predators;[77] the emu on the other hand was more vulnerable to the Thylacine's adaptions including
endurance hunting and bipedal hop.[76] Dingoes, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feral_dog"] feral dogs and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_fox"] red foxes have all been noted to hunt the
emu on the mainland[78][79] and killings of emus by dogs were noted in Tasmania.[80] European settlers
believed the thylacine to prey upon farmers' sheep and poultry.[81][82] Throughout the 20th century, the
thylacine was often characterised as primarily a blood drinker; according to Robert Paddle, the story's
popularity seems to have originated from a single second-hand account heard by Geoffrey Smith (1881–
1916)[83][84] in a shepherd's hut.[85]
Page 8
There is some controversy over the preferred prey size of the
thylacine. A 2011 study by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_South_Wales"] University of New South Wales
using advanced computer modelling indicated that the thylacine
had surprisingly feeble jaws. Animals usually take prey close to
their own body size, but an adult thylacine of around 30 kilograms
(66 lb) was found to be incapable of handling prey much larger
than 5 kilograms (11 lb). Thus, some researchers believe thylacines
only ate small animals such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandicoot"] bandicoots and possums, putting
 them into direct competition with the Tasmanian devil and the tiger
quoll. Another study in 2020 produced similar results, after
estimating the average thylacine weight as about 17 kilograms
(37 lb) rather than 30 kilograms (66 lb), suggesting that the animal
did indeed hunt much smaller prey.[43] 
Analysis of the skeleton suggests
that, when hunting, the thylacine
relied on stamina rather than speed
in the chase.
However, an earlier study showed that the thylacine had a bite force quotient of 166, similar to that of most
quolls; in modern mammalian predators, such a high bite force is almost always associated with predators
which routinely take prey as large, or larger than, themselves.[86] If the thylacine was indeed specialised for
small prey, this specialisation likely made it susceptible to small disturbances to the ecosystem.[87]
 Analysis of the skeletal frame and observations of the thylacine in captivity suggest the species were pursuit
predators, singling out a prey item and pursuing them until the prey was exhausted. However, trappers
reported it as an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush_predator"] ambush predator.[48] The animal may have hunted in small family groups, with the main
group herding prey in the general direction of an individual waiting in ambush.[27] Although the living grey
wolf is widely seen as the thylacine's counterpart, the thylacine may have been more of an ambush predator
as opposed to a pursuit predator. In fact, the predatory behaviour of the thylacine was probably closer to
ambushing felids than to large pursuit canids. Its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach"] stomach was muscular, and could distend to allow the
animal to eat large amounts of food at one time, probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods
when hunting was unsuccessful and food scarce.[48]
In captivity, thylacines were fed a wide variety of foods, including dead rabbits and wallabies as well as
beef, mutton, horse, and occasionally poultry.[88] There is a report of a captive thylacine which refused to
eat dead wallaby flesh or to kill and eat a live wallaby offered to it, but "ultimately it was persuaded to eat
by having the smell of blood from a freshly killed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallaby"] wallaby put before its nose."[89]
In 2017, Berns and Ashwell published comparative [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_map"] cortical maps of thylacine and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_devil"] Tasmanian devil brains,
showing that the thylacine had a larger, more modularised [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_ganglion"] basal ganglion. The authors associated these
differences with the thylacine's predatory lifestyle.[90] The same year, White, Mitchell and Austin published
a large-scale analysis of thylacine mitochondrial genomes, showing that they had split into Eastern and
Western populations on the mainland prior to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Maximum"] Last Glacial Maximum and had low genetic diversity by
the time of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Australia_(1788%E2%80%931850)#Colonisation"] European arrival.[91]
Relationship with humans
Captivity
By the beginning of the 20th century, the increasing rarity of thylacines led to increased demand for captive
specimens by zoos around the world.[92] Despite the export of breeding pairs, attempts at having thylacines
in captivity were unsuccessful, and the last thylacine outside Australia died at London Zoo in 1931.[93]

Extinction in the Australian mainland
Australia lost more than 90% of its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_megafauna"] megafauna by around 40,000
years ago, with the notable exceptions of several kangaroo species
and the thylacine.[94] A 2010 paper examining this issue showed
that humans were likely to be one of the major factors in the
extinction of many species in Australia although the authors of the
research warned that one-factor explanations might be
oversimplistic.[94] The thylacine itself likely neared extinction
throughout most of its range in mainland Australia by about 2,000
years ago.[4] 
Thylacine rock art at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubirr"] Ubirr
However, reliable accounts of thylacine survival in South Australia
 (though confined to the "thinly settled districts" and Flinders
Ranges) and New South Wales ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains_(New_South_Wales)"] Blue Mountains) exist from as late
as the 1830s, from both indigenous and European sources.[95]
A study proposes that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingo#Impact"] arrival of the dingoes may have led to the
 extinction of the Tasmanian devil, the thylacine, and the Tasmanian
native hen in mainland Australia because the dingo might have
competed with the thylacine and devil in preying on the native hen.
However, the study also proposes that an increase in the human
population that gathered pace around 4,000 years ago may have led
to this.[96]
However, a counter-argument is that the two species were not in  Killed thylacine, 1869
direct competition with one another because the dingo primarily
 hunts during the day, whereas it is thought that the thylacine [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality"] hunted mostly at night. Nonetheless, recent
morphological examinations of dingo and thylacine skulls show that although the dingo had a weaker bite,
its skull could resist greater stresses, allowing it to pull down larger prey than the thylacine. The thylacine
was less versatile in its diet than the omnivorous dingo.[97][98] Their ranges appear to have overlapped
because thylacine [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfossil"] subfossil remains have been discovered near those of dingoes. The adoption of the dingo
as a hunting companion by the indigenous peoples would have put the thylacine under increased
pressure.[96]
A 2013 study suggested that, while dingoes were a contributing factor to the thylacine's demise on the
mainland around 3,000 years ago, larger factors were the intense human population growth and
technological advances and the abrupt change in the climate during the period.[99][100]
Extinction in Tasmania
Although the thylacine was extinct on mainland Australia, it survived into the 1930s on the island state of
Tasmania. At the time of the first European settlement, the heaviest distributions were in the northeast,
northwest and north-midland regions of the state.[64] They were rarely sighted during this time but slowly
began to be credited with numerous attacks on sheep. This led to the establishment of bounty schemes in an
attempt to control their numbers. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Diemen%27s_Land_Company"] Van Diemen's Land Company introduced bounties on the thylacine
from as early as 1830, and between 1888 and 1909 the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Tasmania"] Tasmanian government paid £1 per head for dead
adult thylacines and ten [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shilling"] shillings for pups. In all, they paid out 2,184 bounties, but it is thought that many
more thylacines were killed than were claimed for. Its extinction is popularly attributed to these relentless
efforts by farmers and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_hunter"] bounty hunters.[51][101][102]
Page 10
However, it is likely that multiple factors led to its decline and
eventual extinction, including competition with wild dogs
introduced by European settlers,[103] erosion of its habitat, the
concurrent extinction of prey species, and a distemper-like disease
that affected many captive specimens at the time.[49][104] A study
from 2012 also found that were it not for an epidemiological
influence, the extinction of thylacine would have been at best
prevented, at worst postponed. "The chance of saving the species,
through changing public opinion, and the re-establishment of
captive breeding, could have been possible. But the marsupi-
carnivore disease, with its dramatic effect on individual thylacine
longevity and juvenile mortality, came far too soon, and spread far
too quickly."[105]

Whatever the reason, the animal had become extremely rare in the wild by the late 1920s. Despite the fact
that the thylacine was believed by many to be responsible for attacks on sheep, in 1928 the Tasmanian
Advisory Committee for Native Fauna recommended a reserve similar to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_River_National_Park"] Savage River National Park to
protect any remaining thylacines, with potential sites of suitable habitat including the Arthur-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieman_River"] Pieman area of
western Tasmania.[106]
The last known thylacine to be killed in the wild was shot in 1930 by Wilf Batty, a farmer from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawbanna,_Tasmania"] Mawbanna
in the state's northwest. The animal, believed to have been a male, had been seen around Batty's house for
several weeks.[107][108]
Work in 2012 examined the relationship of the genetic diversity of the thylacines before their extinction.
The results indicated that the last of the thylacines in Tasmania had limited genetic diversity due to their
complete geographic isolation from mainland Australia.[109] Further investigations in 2017 showed
evidence that this decline in genetic diversity started long before the arrival of humans in Australia, possibly
starting as early as 70–120 thousand years ago.[44]

Benjamin and searches
The last captive thylacine, often referred to as Benjamin, lived as an endling; (the known last of its species),
at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobart_Zoo"] Hobart Zoo until its death on the night of September 6, 1936.[112] Its source has long been disputed.
Until recently, Elias Churchill was regularly quoted as being the captor, but there appears to be little
evidence to support this claim. Two more recent candidates are far better placed evidentially as the probable
source – the Kaine capture near Preolenna in 1931[113] and the Delphin capture near Waratah in 1930.[114]
The thylacine died on the night of 6–7 September 1936. It is believed to have died as the result of neglect—
locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters, it was exposed to a rare occurrence of extreme Tasmanian
weather: extreme heat during the day and freezing temperatures at night.[115] This thylacine features in the
last known motion picture footage of a living specimen: 45 seconds of black-and-white footage showing
the thylacine in its enclosure in a clip taken in 1933, by naturalist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fleay"] David Fleay.[116] In the film footage, the
thylacine is seen seated, walking around the perimeter of its enclosure, yawning, sniffing the air, scratching
Page 12
itself (in the same manner as a dog), and lying down. Fleay was
bitten on the buttock whilst shooting the film.[116] In 2021, a
digitally colourised 80-second clip of Fleay's footage of Benjamin
was released by the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia,
to mark National Threatened Species Day. The digital colourisation
process was completed by a Paris-based company, based on
historic primary and secondary descriptions to ensure an as exact
colour match as possible.[117][118]
Benjamin was an endling, and lived
as the last known Tasmanian tiger,
photographed at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobart_Zoo"] Hobart Zoo in 1933. 
Frank Darby, who claimed to have been a keeper at Hobart Zoo,
suggested Benjamin as having been the animal's pet name in a
newspaper article of May 1968. No documentation exists to
suggest that it ever had a pet name, and Alison Reid (de facto
curator at the zoo) and Michael Sharland (publicist for the zoo)
denied that Frank Darby had ever worked at the zoo or that the
name Benjamin was ever used for the animal. Darby also appears
to be the source for the claim that the last thylacine was a male.[119]
Robert Paddle was unable to uncover any records of any Frank
Darby having been employed by Beaumaris/Hobart Zoo during the
time that Reid or her father was in charge and noted several
inconsistencies in the story Darby told during his interview in 1968.
The sex of the last captive thylacine has been a point of debate
The last known thylacine since its death at the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart, Tasmania. In 2011,
photographed at Beaumaris Zoo in  a detailed examination of a single frame from the motion film
1933. A scrotal sac is not visible in  footage confirmed that the thylacine was male. When frame III is
this or any other of the photos or film
taken, leading to the supposition that
Benjamin was a female. However, 
enlarged the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum"] scrotum can be seen; and by enhancing the frame, the
outline of the individual [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testes"] testes is discernable.[120]
photographic analysis in 2011
suggested that Benjamin was male. 
After the thylacine's death,
the zoo expected that it
would soon find a
replacement,[107] and
"Benjamin"'s death was not reported on in the media at the
time.[121] Although there had been a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_movement"] conservation movement
pressing for the thylacine's protection since 1901, driven in part by
the increasing difficulty in obtaining specimens for overseas
collections, political difficulties prevented any form of protection

coming into force until 1936. Official protection of the species by
the Tasmanian government was introduced on 10 July 1936, 59
days before the last known specimen died in captivity.[122]
A thylacine was reportedly shot and photographed at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawbanna,_Tasmania"] Mawbanna in 1938. A 1957 sighting from a
helicopter could not be confirmed on the ground. An animal killed in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Cape"] Sandy Cape at night in 1961 was
tentatively identified as a thylacine.[107] The results of subsequent searches indicated a strong possibility of
the survival of the species in Tasmania into the 1960s. Searches by Dr. Eric Guiler and David Fleay in the
northwest of Tasmania found [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprint"] footprints and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces"] scats that may have belonged to the animal, heard [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_communication"] vocalisations
matching the description of those of the thylacine, and collected anecdotal evidence from people reported
having sighted the animal.
Page 13
Despite the searches, no conclusive evidence was found to point to its continued existence in the wild.[37]
Between 1967 and 1973, zoologist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Griffith"] Jeremy Griffith and dairy farmer James Malley conducted what is
regarded as the most intensive search ever carried out, including exhaustive surveys along Tasmania's west
coast, installation of automatic camera stations, prompt investigations of claimed sightings, and in 1972 the
creation of the Thylacine Expeditionary Research Team with Dr. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Brown"] Bob Brown, which concluded without
finding any evidence of the thylacine's existence.[123]
The thylacine held the status of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species"] endangered species until the 1980s. International standards at the time
stated that an animal could not be declared extinct until 50 years had passed without a confirmed record.
Since no definitive proof of the thylacine's existence in the wild had been obtained for more than 50 years,
it met that official criterion and was declared extinct by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature"] International Union for Conservation of Nature
in 1982[4] and by the Tasmanian government in 1986. The species was removed from Appendix I of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in 2013.[124]
Unconfirmed sightings
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Environment_and_Conservation_(Western_Australia)"] Department of Conservation and Land Management recorded
203 reports of sightings of the thylacine in Western Australia from
1936 to 1998.[67] On the mainland, sightings are most frequently
reported in Southern Victoria.[125]
In 1982, a researcher with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania_Parks_and_Wildlife_Service"] Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service,
Hans Naarding, observed what he believed to be a thylacine for
three minutes during the night at a site near Arthur River in
northwestern Tasmania. The sighting led to an extensive year-long
government-funded search.[126] In 1985, Aboriginal tracker Kevin
Cameron produced five photographs which appear to show a
 digging thylacine, which he stated he took in Western
Australia.[127]

thylacine in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyengana,_Tasmania"] Pyengana region of northeastern Tasmania in the
early hours of the morning. Later searches revealed no trace of the
animal.[128] In 1997, it was reported that locals and missionaries near
 Mount Carstensz in Western New Guinea had sighted thylacines.[129][130]
The locals had apparently known about them for many years but had not
made an official report.[131] In February 2005 Klaus Emmerichs, a German
tourist, claimed to have taken digital photographs of a thylacine he saw
near the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_Mountain-Lake_St_Clair_National_Park"] Lake St Clair National Park, but the authenticity of the
photographs has not been established.[132] The photos were published in
April 2006, fourteen months after the sighting. The photographs, which
showed only the back of the animal, were said by those who studied them
to be inconclusive as evidence of the thylacine's continued existence.[133]
 In light of two detailed sightings around 1983 from the remote Cape York
Peninsula of mainland Australia, scientists led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Laurance"] Bill Laurance announced
plans in 2017 to survey the area for thylacines using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_trap"] camera traps.[134][135] 
Map of reported sightings in
the southwest of Western
Australia
In 2017, 580 camera traps were deployed in North Queensland by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook_University"] James Cook University after two people
– an experienced outdoorsman and a former Park Ranger – reported having seen a thylacine there in the
1980s but being too embarrassed to tell anyone at the time.[136][137]
Page 14
According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Primary_Industries,_Parks,_Water_and_Environment"] Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment, there have been eight
unconfirmed thylacine sighting reports between 2016 and 2019, with the latest unconfirmed visual sighting
on 25 February 2018.[138]
Since the disappearance and effective extinction of the thylacine, speculation and searches for a living
specimen have become a topic of interest to some members of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptozoology"] cryptozoology subculture.[139] The
search for the animal has been the subject of books and articles, with many reported sightings that are
largely regarded as dubious. According to writer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errol_Fuller"] Errol Fuller, the most likely record of the species
persistence was proposed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Athol_Douglas&action=edit&redlink=1"] Athol Douglas in the journal Cryptozoology, where Douglas challenges the
carbon dating of the specimen found at Mundrabilla in South Australia as 4,500 years old; Douglas
proposed instead that the well-preserved thylacine carcass was several months old when discovered. The
dating of the specimen has not been reassessed.[140]
A preliminary 2021 study published by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Brook_(scientist)"] Brook et al.. compiles many of the alleged sightings of thylacines
in Tasmania throughout the 20th century and claims that contrary to beliefs that thylacines went extinct in
the 1930s, the Tasmanian thylacine may have actually lasted throughout the 20th century with a window of
extinction between the 1980s and the present day, with the likely extinction date being between the late
1990s and early 2000s. The study claims that the reason behind the apparent lack of confirmed sightings
during this wide and relatively recent time range is the lack of wide deployment of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_trap"] camera traps (which
have been used to rediscover other elusive carnivores, such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanzibar_leopard"] Zanzibar leopard) in Tasmania until the
early 21st century, by which time the thylacine would be extinct or very nearly so. This study has not yet
been [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review"] peer-reviewed.[141][142]
Rewards
In 1983, the American [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_mogul"] media mogul [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Turner"] Ted Turner offered a $100,000 reward for proof of the continued
existence of the thylacine.[143] A letter sent in response to an inquiry by a thylacine-searcher, Murray
McAllister in 2000, indicated that the offer had been withdrawn.[144] In March 2005, Australian news
magazine [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bulletin_(Australian_periodical)"] The Bulletin, as part of its 125th anniversary celebrations, offered a $1.25 million reward for the
safe capture of a live thylacine. When the offer closed at the end of June 2005, no one had produced any
evidence of the animal's existence. An offer of $1.75 million has subsequently been offered by a Tasmanian
tour operator, Stewart Malcolm.[133] Trapping is illegal under the terms of the thylacine's protection, so any
reward made for its capture is invalid, since a trapping license would not be issued.[143]
Research
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Museum"] Australian Museum in Sydney began a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"] cloning project in
1999.[145] The goal was to use [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"] genetic material from specimens
taken and preserved in the early 20th century to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloning"] clone new
individuals and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-extinction"] restore the species from extinction. Several
molecular biologists have dismissed the project as a public relations
stunt and its chief proponent, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Archer_(paleontologist)"] Mike Archer, received a 2002
nomination for the Australian Skeptics [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_Spoon_Award"] Bent Spoon Award for "the
perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudo-
scientific piffle."[146] 
Specimen in the Oslo museum,

In late 2002, the researchers had some success as they were able to extract replicable [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"] DNA from the
specimens.[147] On 15 February 2005, the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests
showed the DNA retrieved from the specimens had been too badly degraded to be usable.[148][149] In May
2005, Archer, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_South_Wales"] University of New South Wales Dean of Science at the time, former director of the
Page 15
 Australian Museum and evolutionary biologist, announced that the
project was being restarted by a group of interested universities and
a research institute.[133][150]
In 2008, researchers Andrew J. Pask and Marilyn B. Renfree from
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Melbourne"] University of Melbourne and Richard R. Behringer from the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin"] University of Texas at Austin reported that they managed to restore
functionality of a gene [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col2A1"] Col2A1 enhancer obtained from 100-year-

old ethanol-fixed thylacine tissues from museum collections. The
genetic material was found working in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenic"] transgenic mice. The
research enhanced hopes of eventually restoring the population of
thylacines.[151][152] That same year, another group of researchers
successfully sequenced the complete thylacine mitochondrial genome from two museum specimens. Their
success suggests that it may be feasible to sequence the complete thylacine nuclear genome from museum
specimens. Their results were published in the journal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_Research"] Genome Research in 2009.[39]
Mike Archer reported about the possibilities of resurrecting the
 thylacine and the gastric-brooding frog at TED2013.[153] Stewart
Brand spoke at TED2013 about the ethics and possibilities of de-
extinction, and made reference to thylacine in his talk.[154]A draft
 genome sequence of the thylacine was produced by Feigin et al.
(2017) using the DNA extracted from an ethanol-preserved pouch
young specimen provided by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museums_Victoria"] Museums Victoria. The neonatal
development of the thylacine was also reconstructed from Preserved thylacine pouch young
preserved pouch young specimens from several museum
collections.[155] Researchers used the genome to study aspects of 
specimens. Specimen f was found to
belong to a different species of
the thylacine's evolution and natural history, including the genetic
 basis of its convergence with canids, clarifying its evolutionary 
 marsupial (quoll or Tasmanian

relationships with other marsupials and examining changes in its
 population size over time.[156] The genomic basis of the
convergent evolution between the thylacine and grey wolf was further investigated in 2019,[157] with
researchers identifying many [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_DNA"] non-coding genomic regions displaying accelerated rates of evolution, a test
for genetic regions evolving under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_Selection"] Positive Selection. In 2021,[158] researchers further identified a link
between the convergent skull shapes of the thylacine and wolf,[156] and the previously identified genetic
candidates.[157] It was reported that specific groups of skull bones, which develop from a common
population of stem cells called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_crest"] Neural crest cells, showed strong similarity between the thylacine and
wolf[158] and corresponded with the underlying convergent genetic candidates which influence these cells
during development.[157]
Also in 2017, a reference library of 159 micrographic images of thylacine hair was jointly produced by
 CSIRO and Where Light Meets Dark, using scanning electron microscopy, metal-coated scanning electron
microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy and optical light microscopy.[159]In 2018, Rehberg
published a study into the appearance of thylacine stripes using infrared flash camera trap photography.[160]
Research into thylacines relies heavily on specimens held in museums and other institutions across the
 world. The number and distribution of these specimens has been recorded in the International Thylacine
Specimen Database. As of 2022, 756 specimens held in 115 museums and university collections in 23
countries.[161]
Cultural significance
Page 16
In Aboriginal tradition
Few [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Aboriginal"] Tasmanian Aboriginal beliefs about the thylacine have been recorded and preserved. One Nuenonne
myth recorded by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jackson_Cotton&action=edit&redlink=1"] Jackson Cotton tells of a thylacine pup saving Palana, a spirit boy, from an attack by a
giant kangaroo. Palana marked the pup's back with ochre as a mark of its bravery, giving thylacines their
stripes.[162] A constellation, "Wurrawana Corinna" (identified as within or near Gemini), was also created
as a commemoration of this mythic act of bravery.[163][164]
 George Augustus Robinson recorded that while some Aboriginal groups on Tasmania ate thylacines, others
revered the animal and refused to do so.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunwinggu"] Gunwinggu on mainland Australia have preserved both a name for the thylacine (djankerrk) and an
account of its behaviour. A Gunwinggu story tells of two ancestral thylacines hunting a kangaroo by biting
at its tail, and the animals later falling from a cliff into a creek and transforming into fish. The thylacines
transformed into archerfish, hence archerfish have stripes on their tails. Thylacines are also associated with
waterfalls and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Serpent"] Rainbow Serpent.[165]
Akngwelye, an ancestral being from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrernte_people"] Arrernte Dreaming stories, is traditionally interpreted as a dingo,
although there is some consensus that the animal was a thylacine in original tellings of the story.[166]
As a symbol
The best known illustrations of Thylacinus cynocephalus
were those in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gould"] John Gould's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mammals_of_Australia"] The Mammals of Australia
(1845–63), often copied since its publication and the most
frequently reproduced,[167] and given further exposure by
 Cascade Brewery's appropriation for its label in 1987.[168]
The government of Tasmania published a monochromatic
reproduction of the same image in 1934,[169] the author
 Louisa Anne Meredith also copied it for Tasmanian Friends
and Foes (1881).[167]
The thylacine has been used extensively as a symbol of
 Tasmania. The animal is featured on the official Tasmanian
coat of arms.[170] It is used in the official logos for the

81. Based on the lack of reliable first hand accounts, Robert Paddle argues that the predation on
sheep and poultry may have been exaggerated, suggesting the thylacine was used as a
convenient scapegoat for the mismanagement of the sheep farms, and the image of it as a
poultry killer impressed on the public consciousness by a striking photo taken by Henry
Burrell in 1921.
