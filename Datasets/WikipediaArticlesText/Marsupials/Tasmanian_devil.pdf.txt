Tasmanian devil
The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii)  ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palawa_kani"] palawa kani:
purinina)[3] is a  carnivorous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsupial"] marsupial of the family
Dasyuridae. Until recently, it was only found on the island [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia"] state
of Tasmania, but it has been reintroduced to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales"] New South Wales in
 mainland Australia, with a small breeding population. The size
 of a small dog, the Tasmanian devil became the largest
carnivorous marsupial in the world, following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction"] extinction of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thylacine"] thylacine in 1936. It is related to quolls, and distantly related
to the thylacine. It is characterised by its stocky and muscular
build, black fur, pungent odour, extremely loud and disturbing
screech, keen sense of smell, and ferocity when feeding. The
Tasmanian devil's large head and neck allow it to generate
among the strongest bites per unit body mass of any extant
predatory land mammal. It hunts prey and scavenges on carrion.

 Conservation status
Although devils are usually solitary, they sometimes eat and
defecate together in a communal location. Unlike most other
dasyurids, the devil [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation"] thermoregulates effectively, and is active
during the middle of the day without overheating. Despite its
rotund appearance, it is capable of surprising speed and
endurance, and can climb trees and swim across rivers. Devils
are not monogamous. Males fight one another for females, and
guard their partners to prevent female infidelity. Females can
ovulate three times in as many weeks during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_breeder"] mating season,
and 80% of two-year-old females are seen to be pregnant during
the annual mating season.
Females average four breeding seasons in their life, and give
birth to 20 to 30 live young after three weeks' gestation. The
newborn are pink, lack fur, have indistinct facial features, and
weigh around 0.20 g (0.0071 oz) at birth. As there are only four
nipples in the pouch, competition is fierce, and few newborns
survive. The young grow rapidly, and are ejected from the pouch
after around 100 days, weighing roughly 200 g (7.1 oz). The
young become independent after around nine months.

Taxonomy
Believing it to be a type of opossum, naturalist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Prideaux_Robert_Harris"] George Harris wrote the first published description of the
Tasmanian devil in 1807, naming it Didelphis ursina,[4] due to its bearlike characteristics such as the round
ear.[5] He had earlier made a presentation on the topic at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoological_Society_of_London"] Zoological Society of London.[6] However,
that particular binomial name had been given to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_wombat"] common wombat (later reclassified as Vombatus
ursinus) by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Shaw_(biologist)"] George Shaw in 1800, and was hence unavailable.[7] In 1838, a specimen was named
Dasyurus laniarius by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Owen"] Richard Owen,[3] but by 1877 he had relegated it to Sarcophilus. The modern
Tasmanian devil was named Sarcophilus harrisii ("Harris's flesh-lover") by French naturalist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Boitard"] Pierre Boitard
in 1841.[8]
A later revision of the devil's taxonomy, published in 1987, attempted to change the species name to
Sarcophilus laniarius based on mainland fossil records of only a few animals.[9] However, this was not
accepted by the taxonomic community at large; the name S. harrisii has been retained and S. laniarius
relegated to a fossil species.[7] "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beelzebub"] Beelzebub's pup" was an early vernacular name given to it by the explorers
of Tasmania, in reference to a religious figure who is a prince of hell and an assistant of Satan;[6] the
Page 3
explorers first encountered the animal by hearing its far-reaching vocalisations at night.[10] Related names
that were used in the 19th century were Sarcophilus satanicus ("Satanic flesh-lover") and Diabolus ursinus
("bear devil"), all due to early misconceptions of the species as implacably vicious.[6] The Tasmanian devil
(Sarcophilus harrisii) belongs to the family Dasyuridae. The genus Sarcophilus contains two other species,
known only from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene"] Pleistocene fossils: S. laniarius and S. moomaensis. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics"] Phylogenetic analysis shows that the
Tasmanian devil is most closely related to quolls.[11]
According to Pemberton, the possible ancestors of the devil may have needed to climb trees to acquire
food, leading to a growth in size and the hopping gait of many marsupials. He speculated that these
adaptations may have caused the contemporary devil's peculiar gait.[12] The specific lineage of the
Tasmanian devil is theorised to have emerged during the Miocene, molecular evidence suggesting a split
from the ancestors of quolls between 10 and 15 million years ago,[13] when severe climate change came to
bear in Australia, transforming the climate from warm and moist to an arid, dry ice age, resulting in mass
extinctions.[12] As most of their prey died of the cold, only a few carnivores survived, including the
ancestors of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoll"] quoll and thylacine. It is speculated that the devil lineage may have arisen at this time to fill
a niche in the ecosystem, as a scavenger that disposed of carrion left behind by the selective-eating
thylacine.[12] The extinct [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucodon"] Glaucodon ballaratensis of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliocene"] Pliocene age has been dubbed an intermediate
species between the quoll and devil.[14]
Fossil deposits in limestone caves at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naracoorte,_South_Australia"] Naracoorte, South Australia,
dating to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miocene"] Miocene include specimens of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcophilus_laniarius"] S. laniarius, which
were around 15% larger and 50% heavier than modern devils.[15]
Older specimens believed to be 50–70,000 years old were found in
 Darling Downs in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland"] Queensland and in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia"] Western Australia.[16] It is
not clear whether the modern devil evolved from S. laniarius, or
whether they coexisted at the time.[16] Richard Owen argued for
the latter hypothesis in the 19th century, based on fossils found in
1877 in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales"] New South Wales.[16] Large bones attributed to S.
moornaensis have been found in New South Wales,[16] and it has 
A jawbone found in the mainland
 Jenolan Caves
been conjectured that these two extinct larger species may have
hunted and scavenged.[16] It is known that there were several
 genera of thylacine millions of years ago, and that they ranged in size, the smaller being more reliant on
foraging.[17] As the devil and thylacine are similar, the extinction of the co-existing thylacine genera has
been cited as evidence for an analogous history for the devils.[18] It has been speculated that the smaller
size of S. laniarius and S. moornaensis allowed them to adapt to the changing conditions more effectively
and survive longer than the corresponding thylacines.[18] As the extinction of these two species came at a
similar time to human habitation of Australia, hunting by humans and land clearance have been mooted as
possible causes.[19] Critics of this theory point out that as indigenous Australians only developed
 boomerangs and spears for hunting around 10,000 years ago, a critical fall in numbers due to systematic
hunting is unlikely. They also point out that caves inhabited by Aborigines have a low proportion of bones
and rock paintings of devils, and suggest that this is an indication that it was not a large part of indigenous
lifestyle. A scientific report in 1910 claimed that Aborigines preferred the meat of herbivores rather than
carnivores.[20] The other main theory for the extinction was that it was due to the climate change brought
on by the most recent ice age.[19]
Genetics
The Tasmanian devil's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome"] genome was sequenced in 2010 by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellcome_Trust_Sanger_Institute"] Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute.[21] Like all
dasyurids, the devil has 14 chromosomes.[22] Devils have a low [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"] genetic diversity compared to other
Australian marsupials and placental carnivores; this is consistent with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_effect"] founder effect as allelic size ranges
Page 4
were low and nearly continuous throughout all subpopulations
measured. Allelic diversity was measured at 2.7–3.3 in the
subpopulations sampled, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterozygosity"] heterozygosity was in the range
 0.386–0.467.[23] According to a study by Menna Jones, "gene
flow appears extensive up to 50 km (31 mi)", meaning a high
assignment rate to source or close neighbour populations "in
agreement with movement data. At larger scales (150–250 km or  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karyotype"] Karyotype of male Tasmanian devil.
90–200 mi), gene flow is reduced but there is no evidence for
isolation by distance".[23] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster%27s_rule"] Island effects may also have contributed
 to their low genetic diversity. Periods of low population density may also have created moderate population
bottlenecks, reducing genetic diversity.[23] Low genetic diversity is thought to have been a feature in the
Tasmanian devil population since the mid-Holocene.[24] Outbreaks of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_facial_tumour_disease"] devil facial tumour disease (DFTD)
cause an increase in inbreeding.[25] A sub-population of devils in the north-west of the state is genetically
distinct from other devils,[26] but there is some exchange between the two groups.[27]
One strand conformation polymorphism analysis (OSCP) on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_histocompatibility_complex"] major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
 class I domain taken from various locations across Tasmania showed 25 different types, and showed a
different pattern of MHC types in north-western Tasmania to eastern Tasmania. Those devils in the east of
the state have less MHC diversity; 30% are of the same type as the tumour (type 1), and 24% are of type
A.[28] Seven of every ten devils in the east are of type A, D, G or 1, which are linked to DFTD; whereas
only 55% of the western devils fall into these MHC categories. Of the 25 MHC types, 40% are exclusive to
the western devils. Although the north-west population is less genetically diverse overall, it has higher
MHC gene diversity, which allows them to mount an immune response to DFTD. According to this
research, mixing the devils may increase the chance of disease.[28] Of the fifteen different regions in
Tasmania surveyed in this research, six were in the eastern half of the island. In the eastern half, Epping
Forest had only two different types, 75% being type O. In the Buckland-Nugent area, only three types were
present, and there were an average of 5.33 different types per location. In contrast, in the west, Cape Sorell
yielded three types, and Togari North-Christmas Hills yielded six, but the other seven sites all had at least
eight MHC types, and West Pencil Pine had 15 types. There was an average of 10.11 MHC types per site
in the west.[28] Recent research has suggested that the wild population of devils are rapidly evolving a
resistance to DFTD.[29]
Description
The Tasmanian devil is the largest surviving carnivorous marsupial.
It has a squat, thick build, with a large head and a tail which is
about half its body length. Unusually for a marsupial, its forelegs
are slightly longer than its hind legs, and devils can run up to
13 km/h (8.1 mph) for short distances. The fur is usually black,
often with irregular white patches on the chest and rump (although
approximately 16% of wild devils do not have white
patches).[30][31] These markings suggest that the devil is most
active at dawn and dusk, and they are thought to draw biting
attacks toward less important areas of the body, as fighting between
devils often leads to a concentration of scars in that region.[31]
Males are usually larger than females, having an average head and

markings. Around 16% of wild devils
have no markings.
body length of 652 mm (25.7 in), a 258 mm (10.2 in) tail and an
average weight of 8 kg (18 lb). Females have an average head and
body length of 570 mm (22 in), a 244 mm (9.6 in) tail and an average weight of 6 kg (13 lb),[30] although
devils in western Tasmania tend to be smaller.[32] Devils have five long toes on their forefeet, four pointing
to the front and one coming out from the side, which gives the devil the ability to hold food. The hind feet
Page 5
have four toes, and the devils have non-retractable claws.[27] The
stocky devils have a relatively low [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_of_mass"] centre of mass.[33]
Devils are fully grown at two years of age,[26] and few devils live
longer than five years in the wild.[34] Possibly the longest-lived
Tasmanian devil recorded was Coolah, a male devil which lived in
captivity for more than seven years.[35] Born in January 1997 at the
 Cincinnati Zoo, Coolah died in May 2004 at the Fort Wayne
Children's Zoo.[36] The devil stores body fat in its tail, and healthy
devils have fat tails.[37] The tail is largely non-prehensile and is
important to its physiology, social behaviour and locomotion. It acts
as a counterbalance to aid stability when the devil is moving
quickly.[38] An ano-genital scent gland at the base of its tail is used
to mark the ground behind the animal with its strong, pungent
scent.[39] The male has external testes in a pouch-like structure Dentition, as illustrated in Knight's
formed by lateral ventrocrural folds of the abdomen, which partially Sketches in Natural History
hides and protects them. The testes are subovoid in shape and the
mean dimensions of 30 testes of adult males was 3.17 cm
× 2.57 cm (1.25 in × 1.01 in).[40] The female's pouch opens backwards, and is present throughout its life,
unlike some other dasyurids.[40] 
The Tasmanian devil has the most powerful bite relative to body
size of any living mammalian carnivore, exerting a force of 553 N
(56.4 kgf).[41][42] The jaw can open to 75–80 degrees, allowing the
devil to generate the large amount of power to tear meat and crush
bones[38]—sufficient force to allow it to bite through thick metal
wire.[43] The power of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw"] jaws is in part due to its comparatively
large head. The teeth and jaws of Tasmanian devils resemble those
of hyenas, an example of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution"] convergent evolution.[44][45] Dasyurid
teeth resemble those of primitive marsupials. Like all dasyurids, the
Tasmanian devil skeleton on display devil has prominent canines and cheek teeth. It has three pairs of
at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Osteology"] Museum of Osteology, lower incisors and four pairs of upper incisors. These are located at
 Oklahoma City, Oklahoma the top of the front of the devil's mouth.[46] Like dogs, it has 42
teeth, however, unlike dogs, its teeth are not replaced after birth but
grow continuously throughout life at a slow rate.[37][45] It has a
"highly carnivorous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentition"] dentition and [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/trophic"] trophic adaptations for bone consumption".[47] The devil has long claws
that allow it to dig burrows and seek subterranean food easily and grip prey or mates strongly.[45] The teeth
and claw strength allow the devil to attack wombats up to 30 kg (66 lb) in weight.[47] The large neck and
forebody that give the devil its strength also cause this strength to be biased towards the front half of the
body; the lopsided, awkward, shuffling gait of the devil is attributed to this.[48]
The devil has long [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrissae"] whiskers on its face and in clumps on the top of the head. These help the devil locate
prey when foraging in the dark, and aid in detecting when other devils are close during feeding.[45] The
whiskers can extend from the tip of the chin to the rear of the jaw and can cover the span of its shoulder.[45]
Hearing is its dominant sense, and it also has an excellent sense of smell, which has a range of 1 kilometre
(0.6 mi).[37][45] The devil, unlike other marsupials, has a "well-defined, saddle-shaped ectotympanic".[49]
Since devils hunt at night, their vision seems to be strongest in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monochromacy"] black and white. In these conditions they can
detect moving objects readily, but have difficulty seeing stationary objects.[37]
Distribution and habitat
Page 6
Devils are found in all habitats on the island of Tasmania, including the outskirts of urban areas, and are
distributed throughout the Tasmanian mainland and on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbins_Island_(Tasmania)"] Robbins Island (which is connected to mainland
Tasmania at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_tide"] low tide).[50] The north-western population is located west of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_River,_Australia"] Forth River and as far south
as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Harbour"] Macquarie Heads.[1] Previously, they were present on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruny_Island"] Bruny Island from the 19th century, but there
have been no records of them after 1900.[1] They were illegally introduced to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badger_Island"] Badger Island in the mid-
1990s but were removed by the Tasmanian government by 2007. Although the Badger Island population
was free from DFTD, the removed individuals were returned to the Tasmanian mainland, some to infected
areas.[51] A study has modelled the reintroduction of DFTD-free Tasmanian devils to the Australian
mainland in areas where [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingo"] dingoes are sparse. It is proposed that devils would have fewer impacts on both
livestock and native fauna than dingoes, and that the mainland population could act as an additional
 insurance population.[52] In September 2015, 20 immunised captive-bred devils were released into
 Narawntapu National Park, Tasmania.[53] Two later died from being hit by cars.[54]
The "core habitat" of the devils is considered to be within the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Tasmania"] low to moderate annual rainfall zone of
eastern and north-western Tasmania".[27] Tasmanian devils particularly like dry [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sclerophyll"] sclerophyll forests and
coastal woodlands.[55] Although they are not found at the highest altitudes of Tasmania, and their
 population density is low in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnoschoenus_sphaerocephalus"] button grass plains in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_Wilderness"] south-west of the state, their population is high in
dry or mixed sclerophyll forests and coastal heaths. Devils prefer open forest to tall forest, and dry rather
than wet forests.[26] They are also found near roads where roadkill is prevalent, although the devils
themselves are often killed by vehicles while retrieving the carrion.[50] According to the Threatened
Species Scientific Committee, their versatility means that habitat modification from destruction is not seen
as a major threat to the species.[50]
The devil is directly linked to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasyurotaenia_robusta"] Dasyurotaenia robusta, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapeworm"] tapeworm which is classified as Rare under the
Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. This tapeworm is found only in devils.[26]
In late 2020, the species was reintroduced to mainland Australia, in a sanctuary run by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aussie_Ark"] Aussie Ark in the
 Barrington Tops area of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales"] New South Wales. This was the first time devils had lived on the Australian
 mainland in over 3,000 years.[56] 26 adult devils were released into the 400-hectare (990-acre) protected
area, and by late April 2021, seven [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_(marsupial)"] joeys had been born, with up to 20 expected by the end of the year.[57]
Ecology and behaviour
The Tasmanian devil is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species"] keystone species in the ecosystem of
Tasmania.[58] It is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_animal"] nocturnal and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepuscular"] crepuscular hunter, spending the
days in dense bush or in a hole.[55] It has been speculated that
nocturnalism may have been adopted to avoid predation by eagles
and humans.[59] Young devils are predominantly crepuscular.[60]
There is no evidence of torpor.[61]
Young devils can climb trees, but this becomes more difficult as
they grow larger.[62][63] Devils can scale trees of trunk diameter
larger than 40 cm (16 in),  which tend to have no small side
branches to hang onto, up to a height of around 2.5–3 m (8.2–
9.8 ft). Devils that are yet to reach maturity can climb shrubs to a

height of 4 metres (13.1 ft), and can climb a tree to 7 m (23 ft) if it
is not vertical.[64] Adult devils may eat young devils if they are
very hungry, so this climbing behaviour may be an adaptation to allow young devils to escape.[65] Devils
can also swim and have been observed crossing rivers that are 50 metres (160 ft) in width, including icy
cold waterways, apparently enthusiastically.[62]
Page 7
Tasmanian devils do not form packs, but rather spend most of their time alone once weaned.[55][60]
Classically considered as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_animals"] solitary animals, their social interactions were poorly understood. However, a
 field study published in 2009 shed some light on this. Tasmanian devils in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narawntapu_National_Park"] Narawntapu National Park were
fitted with proximity sensing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_collar"] radio collars which recorded their interactions with other devils over several
months from February to June 2006. This revealed that all devils were part of a single huge contact
network, characterised by male-female interactions during mating season, while female–female interactions
were the most common at other times, although frequency and patterns of contact did not vary markedly
between seasons. Previously thought to fight over food, males only rarely interacted with other males.[66]
Hence, all devils in a region are part of a single social network.[67] They are considered to be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)"] non-territorial
in general, but females are territorial around their dens.[37] This allows a higher total mass of devils to
 occupy a given area than territorial animals, without conflict.[68] Tasmanian devils instead occupy a home
range.[69] In a period of between two and four weeks, devils' home ranges are estimated to vary between 4
and 27 km2 (990 and 6,670 acres), with an average of 13 km2 (3,200 acres).[26] The location and geometry
of these areas depend on the distribution of food, particularly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallaby"] wallabies and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pademelon"] pademelons nearby.[68]
Devils use three or four dens regularly. Dens formerly owned by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombats"] wombats are especially prized as
maternity dens because of their security. Dense vegetation near creeks, thick grass tussocks, and caves are
also used as dens. Adult devils use the same dens for life. It is believed that, as a secure den is highly
prized, some may have been used for several centuries by generations of animals.[68] Studies have
suggested that food security is less important than den security, as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat_destruction"] habitat destruction that affects the latter
has had more effect on mortality rates.[68] Young pups remain in one den with their mother, and other
devils are mobile,[68] changing dens every 1–3 days and travelling a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean"] mean distance of 8.6 kilometres
(5.3 mi) every night.[70] However, there are also reports that an upper bound can be 50 kilometres (31 mi)
per night. They choose to travel through lowlands, saddles and along the banks of creeks, particularly
preferring carved-out tracks and livestock paths and eschewing steep slopes and rocky terrain.[26][32] The
amount of movement is believed to be similar throughout the year, except for mothers who have given birth
recently.[26] The similarity in travel distances for males and females is unusual for sexually dimorphic,
solitary carnivores. As a male needs more food, he will spend more time eating than travelling. Devils
typically make circuits of their home range during their hunts.[68] In areas near human habitation, they are
known to steal clothes, blankets and pillows and take them for use in dens in wooden buildings.[71]
While the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasyuridae"] dasyurids have similar diet and anatomy, differing body sizes affect [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation"] thermoregulation and thus
behaviour.[72] In ambient temperatures between 5 and 30 °C (41 and 86 °F), the devil was able to maintain
a body temperature between 37.4 and 38 °C (99.3 and 100.4 °F). When the temperature was raised to
40 °C (104 °F), and the humidity to 50%, the devil's body temperature spiked upwards by 2 °C (3.6 °F)
within 60 minutes, but then steadily decreased back to the starting temperature after a further two hours,
and remained there for two more hours. During this time, the devil drank water and showed no visible signs
of discomfort, leading scientists to believe that sweating and evaporative cooling is its primary means of
heat dissipation.[73] A later study found that devils pant but do not sweat to release heat.[27] In contrast,
many other marsupials were unable to keep their body temperatures down.[74] As the smaller animals have
to live in hotter and more arid conditions to which they are less well-adapted, they take up a nocturnal
lifestyle and drop their body temperatures during the day, whereas the devil is active in the day and its body
temperature varies by 1.8 °C (3.2 °F) from its minimum at night to the maximum in the middle of the
day.[75]
The standard [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_rate"] metabolic rate of a Tasmanian devil is 141 kJ/kg (15.3 kcal/lb) per day, many times lower
than smaller marsupials. A 5-kilogram (11 lb) devil uses 712 kilojoules (170 kcal) per day. The field
metabolic rate is 407 kJ/kg (44.1 kcal/lb).[74] Along with quolls, Tasmanian devils have a metabolic rate
comparable to non-carnivorous marsupials of a similar size. This differs from placental carnivores, which
have comparatively high basal metabolic rates.[76] A study of devils showed a loss of weight from 7.9 to
7.1 kilograms (17 to 16 lb) from summer to winter, but in the same time, daily energy consumption
Page 8
increased from 2,591 to 2,890 kilojoules (619 to 691 kcal). This is equivalent to an increase in food
consumption from 518 to 578 grams (18.3 to 20.4 oz).[77] The diet is protein-based with 70% water
content. For every 1 gram (0.035 oz) of insects consumed, 3.5 kilojoules (0.84 kcal) of energy are
produced, while a corresponding amount of wallaby meat generated 5.0 kilojoules (1.2 kcal).[77] In terms
of its body mass, the devil eats only a quarter of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_quoll"] eastern quoll's intake,[77] allowing it to survive longer
during food shortages.
Feeding
Tasmanian devils can take prey up to the size of a small kangaroo,
but in practice they are opportunistic and eat [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion"] carrion more often
than they hunt live prey. Although the devil favours [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wombat"] wombats
because of the ease of predation and high fat content, it will eat all
small native mammals such as wallabies,[78] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bettong"] bettong and potoroos,
domestic mammals (including sheep and rabbits),[78] birds
(including penguins),[79] fish, fruit, vegetable matter, insects,
tadpoles, frogs and reptiles. Their diet is widely varied and depends
on the food available.[37][80][81][82] Before the extinction of the 
A devil eating roadkill
thylacine, the Tasmanian devil ate thylacine joeys left alone in dens
when their parents were away. This may have helped to hasten the extinction of the thylacine, which also
ate devils.[47] They are known to hunt water rats by the sea and forage on dead fish that have been washed
ashore. Near human habitation, they can also steal shoes and chew on them,[80] and eat the legs of
otherwise robust sheep that have slipped in wooden shearing sheds, leaving their legs dangling below.[62]
Other unusual matter observed in devil scats includes collars and tags of devoured animals, intact echidna
spines, pencil, plastic and jeans.[59] Devils can bite through metal traps, and tend to reserve their strong
jaws for escaping captivity rather than breaking into food storage.[59] Due to their relative lack of speed,
they can not run down a wallaby or a rabbit, but they can attack animals that have become slow due to
illness.[80] They survey flocks of sheep by sniffing them from 10–15 m (33–49 ft) away and attack if the
prey is ill. The sheep stamp their feet in a show of strength.[59]
Despite their lack of extreme speed, there have been reports that devils can run at 25 km/h (16 mph) for
1.5 km (0.93 mi), and it has been conjectured that, before European immigration and the introduction of
livestock, vehicles and roadkill, they would have had to chase other native animals at a reasonable pace to
find food.[62] Pemberton has reported that they can average 10 km/h (6.2 mph) for "extended periods" on
several nights per week, and that they run for long distances before sitting still for up to half an hour,
something that has been interpreted as evidence of ambush predation.[62]
Devils can dig to forage corpses, in one case digging down to eat the corpse of a buried horse that had died
due to illness. They are known to eat animal cadavers by first ripping out the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digestive_system"] digestive system, which is the
softest part of the anatomy, and they often reside in the resulting cavity while they are eating.[80]
On average, devils eat about 15% of their body weight each day, although they can eat up to 40% of their
body weight in 30 minutes if the opportunity arises.[39] This means they can become very heavy and
lethargic after a large meal; in this state they tend to waddle away slowly and lie down, becoming easy to
approach. This has led to a belief that such eating habits became possible due to the lack of a predator to
attack such bloated individuals.[81]
Tasmanian devils can eliminate all traces of a carcass of a smaller animal, devouring the bones and fur if
desired.[83] In this respect, devils have earned the gratitude of Tasmanian farmers, as the speed at which
they clean a carcass helps prevent the spread of insects that might otherwise harm livestock.[84] Some of
Page 9
these dead animals are disposed of when the devils haul off the excess feed back to their residence to
continue eating at a later time.[80]
The diet of a devil can vary substantially for males and females, and seasonally, according to studies at
Cradle Mountain. In winter, males prefer medium mammals over larger ones, with a ratio of 4:5, but in
summer, they prefer larger prey in a 7:2 ratio. These two categories accounted for more than 95% of the
diet. Females are less inclined to target large prey, but have the same seasonal bias. In winter, large and
medium mammals account for 25% and 58% each, with 7% small mammals and 10% birds. In summer, the
first two categories account for 61% and 37% respectively.[61]
Juvenile devils are sometimes known to climb trees;[85] in addition to small vertebrates and invertebrates,
juveniles climb trees to eat grubs and birds' eggs.[60] Juveniles have also been observed climbing into nests
and capturing birds.[64] Throughout the year, adult devils derive 16.2% of their biomass intake from
 arboreal species, almost all of which is possum meat, just 1.0% being large birds. From February to July,
subadult devils derive 35.8% of their biomass intake from arboreal life, 12.2% being small birds and 23.2%
being possums. Female devils in winter source 40.0% of their intake from arboreal species, including
26.7% from possums and 8.9% from various birds.[64] Not all of these animals were caught while they
were in trees, but this high figure for females, which is higher than for male spotted-tailed quolls during the
same season, is unusual, as the devil has inferior tree climbing skills.[64]
Although they hunt alone,[37] there have been unsubstantiated
claims of communal hunting, where one devil drives prey out of its
habitat and an accomplice attacks.[80] Eating is a social event for
the Tasmanian devil. This combination of a solitary animal that eats
communally makes the devil unique among carnivores.[60] Much
of the noise attributed to the animal is a result of raucous communal
eating, at which up to 12 individuals can gather,[39] although
groups of two to five are common;[86] it can often be heard several
kilometres away. This has been interpreted as notifications to  Three Tasmanian devils feeding.
colleagues to share in the meal, so that food is not wasted by rot
and energy is saved.[80] The amount of noise is correlated to the
size of the carcass.[80] The devils eat in accordance with a system. 
Eating is a social event for the
Tasmanian devil, and groups of 2 to
5 are common.
Juveniles are active at dusk, so they tend to reach the source before
the adults.[81] Typically, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(ethology)"] dominant animal eats until it is satiated
and leaves, fighting off any challengers in the meantime. Defeated animals run into the bush with their hair
and tail erect, their conqueror in pursuit and biting their victim's rear where possible. Disputes are less
common as the food source increases as the motive appears to be getting sufficient food rather than
oppressing other devils.[81] When [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoll"] quolls are eating a carcass, devils will tend to chase them away.[64] This
is a substantial problem for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted-tailed_quoll"] spotted-tailed quolls, as they kill relatively large possums and cannot finish their
meal before devils arrive. In contrast, the smaller [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_quoll"] eastern quolls prey on much smaller victims, and can
complete feeding before devils turn up.[64] This is seen as a possible reason for the relatively small
population of spotted-tailed quolls.[64]
A study of feeding devils identified twenty physical postures, including their characteristic vicious yawn,
and eleven different vocal sounds that devils use to communicate as they feed.[39] They usually establish
dominance by sound and physical posturing,[87] although fighting does occur.[39] The white patches on the
devil are visible to the night-vision of its colleagues.[81] Chemical gestures are also used.[81] Adult males
are the most aggressive,[88] and scarring is common.[89] They can also stand on their hind legs and push
each other's shoulders with their front legs and heads, similar to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo_wrestling"] sumo wrestling.[81] Torn flesh around the
mouth and teeth, as well as punctures in the rump, can sometimes be observed, although these can also be
inflicted during breeding fights.[81]
Page 10
Digestion is very fast in dasyurids and, for the Tasmanian devil, the few hours taken for food to pass
through the small gut is a long period in comparison to some other dasyuridae.[90] Devils are known to
return to the same places to defecate, and to do so at a communal location, called a devil latrine.[91] It is
believed that the communal defecation may be a means of communication that is not well understood.[91]
Devil scats are very large compared to body size; they are on average 15 centimetres (5.9 in) long, but there
have been samples that are 25 centimetres (9.8 in) in length.[91] They are characteristically grey in colour
due to digested bones, or have bone fragments included.[26]
Owen and Pemberton believe that the relationship between Tasmanian devils and thylacines was "close and
complex", as they competed directly for prey and probably also for shelter. The thylacines preyed on the
devils, the devils scavenged from the thylacine's kills, and the devils ate thylacine young. Menna Jones
hypothesises that the two species shared the role of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_predator"] apex predator in Tasmania.[92] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge-tailed_eagle"] Wedge-tailed eagles
have a similar carrion-based diet to the devils and are regarded as competitors.[93] Quolls and devils are
also seen as being in direct competition in Tasmania. Jones believed that the quoll has evolved into its
current state in just 100–200 generations of around two years as determined by the equal spacing effect on
the devil, the largest species, the spotted-tail quoll, and the smallest species, the eastern quoll.[94] Both the
Tasmanian devil and the quolls appears to have evolved up to 50 times faster than the average evolutionary
rate amongst mammals.[95]
Reproduction 
Developmental steps in the maturation of Tasmanian devil young. The diagonal lines
indicate the amount of time the changes take; for example, it takes about 90 days for
a devil to develop fur over all its body.
Females start to breed when they reach sexual maturity, typically in their second year. At this point, they
become [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrus_cycle"] fertile once a year, producing multiple [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovum"] ova while in heat.[96] As prey is most abundant in spring
and early summer, the devil's reproductive cycle starts in March or April so that the end of the weaning
period coincides with the maximisation of food supplies in the wild for the newly roaming young devils.[97]
Occurring in March, mating takes places in sheltered locations during both day and night. Males fight over
females in the breeding season, and female devils will [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating"] mate with the dominant male.[37][98] Females can
ovulate up to three times in a 21-day period, and copulation can take five days; one instance of a couple
being in the mating den for eight days has been recorded.[98] Devils are not monogamous, and females will
mate with several males if not guarded after mating; males also reproduce with several females during a
season.[37][98] Females have been shown to be selective in an attempt to ensure the best genetic
offspring,[98] for example, fighting off the advances of smaller males.[27] Males often keep their mates in
custody in the den, or take them along if they need to drink, lest they engage in infidelity.[98]
Males can produce up to 16 offspring over their lifetime, while females average four mating seasons and 12
offspring.[98] Theoretically this means that a devil population can double on an annual basis and make the
species insulated against high mortality.[99] The pregnancy rate is high; 80% of two-year-old females were
Page 11
observed with newborns in their pouches during the mating season.[98] More recent studies of breeding
place the mating season between February and June, as opposed to between February and March.[26]
 Gestation lasts 21 days, and devils give birth to 20–30 young standing up,[37][98] each weighing
approximately 0.18–0.24 grams (0.0063–0.0085 oz).[55] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryonic_diapause"] Embryonic diapause does not occur.[96] At birth,
the front limb has well-developed digits with claws; unlike many marsupials, the claws of baby devils are
not deciduous. As with most other marsupials, the forelimb is longer (0.26–0.43 cm or 0.10–0.17 in) than
the rear limb (0.20–0.28 cm or 0.079–0.110 in), the eyes are spots, and the body is pink. There are no
external ears or openings. Unusually, the sex can be determined at birth, with an external scrotum
present.[96]
Tasmanian devil young are variously called "pups",[37] "joeys",[100] or "imps".[101] When the young are
born, competition is fierce as they move from the vagina in a sticky flow of mucus to the pouch. Once
inside the pouch, they each remain attached to a nipple for the next 100 days. The female Tasmanian devil's
pouch, like that of the wombat, opens to the rear, so it is physically difficult for the female to interact with
young inside the pouch. Despite the large litter at birth, the female has only four nipples, so there are never
more than four babies nursing in the pouch, and the older a female devil gets, the smaller her litters will
become. Once the young have made contact with the nipple, it expands, resulting in the oversized nipple
being firmly clamped inside the newborn and ensuring that the newborn does not fall out of the
pouch.[37][98] On average, more females survive than males,[96] and up to 60% of young do not survive to
maturity.[60] Milk replacements are often used for devils that have been bred in captivity, for orphaned
devils or young who are born to diseased mothers. Little is known about the composition of the devil's milk
compared to other marsupials.[102]
Inside the pouch, the nourished young develop quickly. In the second week, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinarium"] rhinarium becomes
distinctive and heavily pigmented.[96] At 15 days, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinna_(anatomy)"] external parts of the ear are visible, although these
are attached to the head and do not open out until the devil is around 10 weeks old. The ear begins
blackening after around 40 days, when it is less than 1 cm (0.39 in) long, and by the time the ear becomes
erect, it is between 1.2 and 1.6 cm (0.47 and 0.63 in). Eyelids are apparent at 16 days, whiskers at 17 days,
and the lips at 20 days.[96] The devils can make squeaking noises after eight weeks, and after around 10–11
weeks, the lips can open.[96] Despite the formation of eyelids, they do not open for three months, although
eyelashes form at around 50 days.[96] The young—up to this point they are pink—start to grow fur at 49
days and have a full coat by 90 days. The fur growing process starts at the snout and proceeds back
through the body, although the tail attains fur before the rump, which is the last part of the body to become
covered. Just before the start of the furring process, the colour of the bare devil's skin will darken and
become black or dark grey in the tail.[96]
The devils have a complete set of facial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrissae"] vibrissae and ulnar carpels,
although it is devoid of [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anconeal"] anconeal vibrissae. During the third week,
the [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mystacial"] mystacials and ulnarcarpals are the first to form. Subsequently,
the infraorbital, interramal, [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/supraorbital"] supraorbital and submental vibrissae
form. The last four typically occur between the 26th and 39th
day.[96] Their eyes open shortly after their fur coat develops—
between 87 and 93 days—and their mouths can relax their hold of
the nipple at 100 days.[96] They leave the pouch 105 days after
birth, appearing as small copies of the parent and weighing around
200 grams (7.1 oz).[96] Zoologist Eric Guiler recorded its size at  Three young devils sunbathing
this time as follows: a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crown-snout_length&action=edit&redlink=1"] crown-snout length of 5.87 cm (2.31 in), tail
length of 5.78 cm (2.28 in), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pes_(anatomy)"] pes length 2.94 cm (1.16 in), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_(anatomy)"] manus
2.30 cm (0.91 in), shank 4.16 cm (1.64 in), forearm 4.34 cm (1.71 in) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown-rump_length"] crown-rump length is 11.9 cm
(4.7 in).[96] During this period, the devils lengthen at a roughly linear rate.[96]
Page 12
After being ejected, the devils stay outside the pouch, but they remain in the den for around another three
months, first venturing outside the den between October and December before becoming independent in
January. During this transitional phase out of the pouch, the young devils are relatively safe from predation
as they are generally accompanied. When the mother is hunting they can stay inside a shelter or come
along, often riding on their mother's back. During this time they continue to drink their mother's milk.
Female devils are occupied with raising their young for all but approximately six weeks of the year.[96][103]
The milk contains a higher amount of iron than the milk of placental mammals.[27] In Guiler's 1970 study,
no females died while rearing their offspring in the pouch. After leaving the pouch, the devils grow by
around 0.5 kg (1.1 lb) a month until they are six months old.[96] While most pups will survive to be
weaned,[26] Guiler reported that up to three fifths of devils do not reach maturity.[60] As juveniles are more
crepuscular than adults, their appearance in the open during summer gives the impression to humans of a
population boom.[60] A study into the success of translocated devils that were orphaned and raised in
captivity found that young devils who had consistently engaged with new experiences while they were in
captivity survived better than young who had not.[104]
Conservation status
The cause of the devil's disappearance from the mainland is
unclear, but their decline seems to coincide with an abrupt change
 in climate and the expansion across the mainland of indigenous
Australians and dingoes.[105][106] However, whether it was direct
hunting by people, competition with dingoes, changes brought
about by the increasing human population, who by 3000 years ago
were using all habitat types across the continent, or a combination
of all three, is unknown; devils had coexisted with dingoes on the
mainland for around 3000 years.[107] Brown has also proposed that
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o-Southern_Oscillation"] El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) grew stronger during the
Holocene, and that the devil, as a scavenger with a short life span,
was highly sensitive to this.[108] In dingo-free Tasmania,[109]
carnivorous marsupials were still active when Europeans arrived.
The extermination of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thylacine"] thylacine after the arrival of the Europeans
is well known,[110] but the Tasmanian devil was threatened as
well.[111] 
An 1808 impression featuring the

den with her pups clinging to her back, making them more
vulnerable.[112] Cancer in general is a common cause of death in
devils.[113] In 2008, high levels of potentially [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenic"] carcinogenic flame retardant chemicals were found in
Tasmanian devils. Preliminary results of tests ordered by the Tasmanian government on chemicals found in
fat tissue from 16 devils have revealed high levels of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexabromobiphenyl"] hexabromobiphenyl (BB153) and "reasonably high"
levels of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decabromodiphenyl_ether"] decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE209).[114] The Save the Tasmanian Devil Appeal is the official
fundraising entity for the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program. The priority is to ensure the survival of the
Tasmanian devil in the wild.
Population declines
At least two major population declines, possibly due to disease epidemics, have occurred in recorded
history: in 1909 and 1950.[30] The devil was also reported as scarce in the 1850s.[115] It is difficult to
estimate the size of the devil population.[116] In the mid-1990s, the population was estimated at 130,000–
Page 13
150,000 animals,[26] but this is likely to have been an overestimate.[116] The Tasmanian devil's population
has been calculated in 2008 by Tasmania's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Primary_Industries_and_Water"] Department of Primary Industries and Water as being in the
range of 10,000 to 100,000 individuals, with 20,000 to 50,000 mature individuals being likely.[37] Experts
estimate that the devil has suffered a more than 80% decline in its population since the mid-1990s and that
only around 10,000–15,000 remain in the wild as of 2008.[117]
The species was listed as vulnerable under the Tasmanian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threatened_Species_Protection_Act_1995"] Threatened Species Protection Act 1995 in
2005[118] and the Australian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act_1999"] Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999[26] in 2006,
which means that it is at risk of extinction in the "medium term".[50] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN"] IUCN classified the Tasmanian
devil in the lower risk/least concern category in 1996, but in 2009 they reclassified it as endangered.[1]
Appropriate wildlife refuges such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_River_National_Park"] Savage River National Park in North west Tasmania provide hope for
their survival.
Culling
The first European Tasmanian settlers ate Tasmanian devil, which they described as tasting like veal.[119]
As it was believed devils would hunt and kill livestock, possibly due to strong imagery of packs of devils
eating weak sheep, a bounty scheme to remove the devil from rural properties was introduced as early as
1830.[120] However, Guiler's research contended that the real cause of livestock losses was poor land
management policies and feral dogs.[120] In areas where the devil is now absent, poultry has continued to
be killed by quolls. In earlier times, hunting possums and wallabies for fur was a big business—more than
900,000 animals were hunted in 1923—and this resulted in a continuation of bounty hunting of devils as
they were thought to be a major threat to the fur industry, even though quolls were more adept at hunting
the animals in question.[121] Over the next 100 years, trapping and poisoning[122] brought them to the
brink of extinction.[111]
After the death of the last thylacine in 1936,[123] the Tasmanian devil was protected by law in June 1941
and the population slowly recovered.[111] In the 1950s, with reports of increasing numbers, some permits to
capture devils were granted after complaints of livestock damage. In 1966, poisoning permits were issued
although attempts to have the animal unprotected failed.[124] During this time environmentalists also
became more outspoken, particularly as scientific studies provided new data suggesting the threat of devils
to livestock had been vastly exaggerated.[125] Numbers may have peaked in the early 1970s after a
population boom; in 1975 they were reported to be lower, possibly due to overpopulation and consequent
lack of food.[126] Another report of overpopulation and livestock damage was reported in 1987.[127] The
following year, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichinella_spiralis"] Trichinella spiralis, a parasite which kills animals and can infect humans, was found in
devils and minor panic broke out before scientists assured the public that 30% of devils had it but that they
could not transmit it to other species.[128] Control permits were ended in the 1990s, but illegal killing
continues to a limited extent, albeit "locally intense". This is not considered a substantial problem for the
survival of the devil.[50] Approximately 10,000 devils were killed per year in the mid-1990s.[27] A
selective culling program has taken place to remove individuals affected with DFTD, and has been shown
to not slow the rate of disease progression or reduced the number of animals dying.[129] A model has been
tested to find out whether culling devils infected with DFTD would assist in the survival of the species, and
it has found that culling would not be a suitable strategy to employ.[130]
Road mortality
Motor vehicles are a threat to localised populations of non-abundant Tasmanian mammals,[131][132] and a
2010 study showed that devils were particularly vulnerable. A study of nine species, mostly marsupials of a
similar size, showed that devils were more difficult for drivers to detect and avoid. At high beam, devils had
Page 14
the lowest detection distance, 40% closer than the median. This
requires a 20% reduction in speed for a motorist to avoid the devil.
For low beam, the devils had the second shortest detection distance,
16% below the median. For avoidance of roadkill to be feasible,
motorists would have to drive at around half the current speed limit
in rural areas.[131] A study in the 1990s on a localised population
of devils in a national park in Tasmania recorded a halving of the
population after a hitherto gravel access road was upgraded,
surfaced with bitumen and widened. At the same time, there was a
large increase in deaths caused by vehicles along the new road;
there had been none in the preceding six months.[132] 
A road sign telling drivers that there
may be devils nearby
The vast majority of deaths occurred in the sealed portion of the
road, believed to be due to an increase in speeds.[132] It was also conjectured that the animals were harder
to see against the dark bitumen instead of the light gravel. The devil and quoll are especially vulnerable as
they often try to retrieve roadkill for food and travel along the road. To alleviate the problem, traffic slowing
measures, man-made pathways that offer alternative routes for devils, education campaigns, and the
installation of light reflectors to indicate oncoming vehicles have been implemented. They are credited with
decreases in roadkill.[132] Devils have often been victims of roadkill when they are retrieving other roadkill.
Work by scientist Menna Jones and a group of conservation volunteers to remove dead animals from the
road resulted in a significant reduction in devil traffic deaths.[84] It was estimated that 3,392 devils, or
between 3.8 and 5.7% of the population, were being killed annually by vehicles in 2001–04.[50] In 2009,
the Save the Tasmanian Devil group launched the "Roadkill Project", which allowed members of the
public to report sightings of devils which had been killed on the road.[133] On 25 September 2015, 20
immunised devils were microchipped and released in Narawntapu National Park. By 5 October 4 had been
hit by cars, prompting Samantha Fox, leader of Save the Tasmanian Devil, to describe roadkill as being the
biggest threat to the Tasmanian devil after DFTD.[134] A series of solar-powered alarms have been trialled
that make noises and flash lights when cars are approaching, warning the animals. The trial ran for 18
months and the trial area had two-thirds less deaths than the control.[135][136]
Devil facial tumour disease
First seen in 1996 in Mount William in northeastern Tasmania,
 devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) has ravaged Tasmania's wild
devils, and estimates of the impact range from 20% to as much as
an 80% decline in the devil population, with over 65% of the state
affected. The state's west coast area and far north-west are the only
places where devils are tumour free.[137][138][139] Individual devils
die within months of infection.[140] The disease is an example of
 transmissible cancer, which means that it is contagious and passed
from one animal to another.[141] However, this tumour is not native
to Tasmanian devils and is also characterised as a tissue graft that is
able to pass between hosts without inducing a response from the
host's immune system.[142] Dominant devils who engage in more
biting behaviour are more exposed to the disease.[143] 
Devil facial tumour disease causes
tumours to form in and around the
mouth, interfering with feeding and
eventually leading to death by
starvation
Wild Tasmanian devil populations are being monitored to track the spread of the disease and to identify
changes in disease prevalence. Field monitoring involves trapping devils within a defined area to check for
the presence of the disease and determine the number of affected animals. The same area is visited
repeatedly to characterise the spread of the disease over time. So far, it has been established that the short-
term effects of the disease in an area can be severe. Long-term monitoring at replicated sites will be
Page 15
essential to assess whether these effects remain, or whether populations can recover.[139] Field workers are
also testing the effectiveness of disease suppression by trapping and removing diseased devils. It is hoped
that the removal of diseased devils from wild populations should decrease disease prevalence and allow
more devils to survive beyond their juvenile years and breed.[139] In March 2017, scientists at the
University of Tasmania presented an apparent first report of having successfully treated Tasmanian devils
with the disease, by injecting live cancer cells into the infected devils to stimulate their immune system to
recognise and fight the disease.[144]
Relationship with humans
At [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lake_Nitchie&action=edit&redlink=1"] Lake Nitchie in western [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales"] New South Wales in 1970, a male human skeleton wearing a necklace of 178
teeth from 49 different devils was found. The skeleton is estimated to be 7000 years old, and the necklace is
believed to be much older than the skeleton. Archaeologist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_Flood"] Josephine Flood believes the devil was hunted
for its teeth and that this contributed to its extinction on mainland Australia. Owen and Pemberton note that
few such necklaces have been found.[145] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midden"] Middens that contain devil bones are rare—two notable
examples are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_Lair"] Devil's Lair in the south-western part of Western Australia and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Hill_State_Game_Reserve"] Tower Hill in Victoria.[146] In
Tasmania, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Aboriginals"] local Indigenous Australians and devils sheltered in the same caves. Tasmanian Aboriginal
names for the devil recorded by Europeans include "tarrabah", "poirinnah", and "par-loo-mer-rer".[147]
Variations also exist, such as "Taraba" and "purinina".[148][149]
It is a common belief that devils will eat humans. While they are known to eat dead bodies, there are
prevalent myths that they eat living humans who wander into the bush.[150] Despite outdated beliefs and
exaggerations regarding their disposition, many, although not all, devils will remain still when in the
presence of a human; some will also shake nervously. They can bite and scratch out of fear when held by a
human, but a firm grip will cause them to remain still.[151] Although they can be tamed, they are asocial,
and are not considered appropriate as pets;[91] they have an unpleasant odour, and neither demonstrate nor
respond to affection.[152]
Until recently, the devil was not studied much by academics and naturalists.[153] At the start of the 20th
century, Hobart zoo operator Mary Roberts, who was not a trained scientist, was credited for changing
people's attitudes and encouraging scientific interest in native animals (such as the devil) that were seen as
fearsome and abhorrent, and the human perception of the animal changed.[154] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Thomson_Flynn"] Theodore Thomson Flynn
was the first professor of biology in Tasmania, and carried out some research during the period around
World War I.[155] In the mid-1960s, Professor Guiler assembled a team of researchers and started a decade
of systematic fieldwork on the devil. This is seen as the start of modern scientific study of it.[156] However,
the devil was still negatively depicted, including in tourism material.[124] The first doctorate awarded for
research into the devil came in 1991.[153]
In captivity
Early attempts to breed Tasmanian devils in captivity had limited success. Mary Roberts bred a pair at
 Beaumaris Zoo (which she named Billy and Truganini) in 1913. However, although advised to remove
Billy, Roberts found Truganini too distressed by his absence, and returned him. The first litter was
presumed eaten by Billy, but a second litter in 1914 survived, after Billy was removed. Roberts wrote an
article on keeping and breeding the devils for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Zoological_Society"] London Zoological Society.[154] Even by 1934,
successful breeding of the devil was rare.[157] In a study on the growth of young devils in captivity, some
developmental stages were very different from those reported by Guiler. The pinnae were free on day 36,
and eyes opened later, on days 115–121.[158] In general, females tend to retain more stress after being taken
into captivity than males.[159]
Page 16
A plan to create "insurance populations" of disease-free devils has
been ongoing since 2005. As of June 2012, the insurance
population has reached a combined total of 500 animals and
representing over 98% of the genetic diversity of this species.[160]
Most of these devils are living in Australian zoos and wildlife
reserves. Beginning in November 2012 however, in an effort to
create a population that is both wild and disease-free, Tasmanian
devils have been relocated to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Island"] Maria Island, a mountainous island
off the east coast of Tasmania.[160] The Maria Island population
has grown from a starting population of twenty-eight to 90, and
experts will soon begin transferring healthy devils back to the At [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healesville_Sanctuary"] Healesville Sanctuary, Victoria
mainland population.[161] A study on the survival rates of the
Maria Island population found that in contrast to other carnivores
raised in captivity, the Tasmanian devils were not adversely affected by being born in captivity when
released on Maria Island.[162]
Tasmanian devils were displayed in various zoos around the world from the 1850s onwards.[163] In the
1950s several animals were given to European zoos.[164] In October 2005 the Tasmanian government sent
four devils, two male and two female, to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_Zoo"] Copenhagen Zoo, following the birth of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Christian_of_Denmark"] first son of
 Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark and his Tasmanian-born wife Mary.[165] Due to restrictions on their
export by the Australian government, at the time these were the only devils known to be living outside
Australia.[26] In June 2013, due to the successes of the insurance population program, it was planned to
send devils to other zoos around the world in a pilot program.[166] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo_Global"] San Diego Zoo Global and
 Albuquerque Biopark were selected to participate in the program,[167] and Wellington Zoo and Auckland
Zoo soon followed.[168] In the United States, four additional zoos have since been selected as part of the
 Australian government's Save the Tasmanian Devil program, the zoos selected were: the Fort Wayne
Children's Zoo,[169] the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Zoo"] Los Angeles Zoo,[170] the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Louis_Zoo"] Saint Louis Zoo,[171] and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo_Zoo"] Toledo Zoo.[172] Captive
devils are usually forced to stay awake during the day to cater to visitors, rather than following their natural
nocturnal style.[173]
There have been reports and suspicions of illegal trading in the past. In 1997, a devil turned up in Western
Australia; it had not escaped from any licensed keeper. During the 1990s there were internet sites in the US
that were advertising devil sales, and rumours that some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy"] US Navy personnel had tried to buy them illegally
during a visit to Tasmania.[174]
In popular culture
The devil is an iconic animal within Australia, and particularly
associated with Tasmania. The animal is used as the emblem of the
 Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service,[37] and the former
Tasmanian Australian rules football team which played in the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Football_League"] Victorian Football League was known as the Devils.[175] The
 Hobart Devils were once part of the National Basketball
 League.[176] The devil has appeared on several commemorative
coins in Australia over the years.[177][178] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascade_Brewery"] Cascade Brewery in
Tasmania sells a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_beer"] ginger beer with a Tasmanian devil on the
label.[179] In 2015, the Tasmanian devil was chosen as Tasmania's
 state emblem.[180]

Tasmanian devils are popular with tourists, and the director of the Tasmanian Devil Conservation Park has
described their possible extinction as "a really significant blow for Australian and Tasmanian tourism".[181]
There has also been a multimillion-dollar proposal to build a giant 19 m-high, 35 m-long devil in
 Launceston in northern Tasmania as a tourist attraction.[182] Devils began to be used as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotourism"] ecotourism in the
1970s, when studies showed that the animals were often the only things known about Tasmania overseas,
and suggested that they should therefore be the centrepiece of marketing efforts, resulting in some devils
being taken on promotional tours.[183]
The Tasmanian devil is probably best known internationally as the inspiration for the Looney Tunes cartoon
character [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Devil_(Looney_Tunes)"] the Tasmanian Devil, or "Taz" in 1954. Little known at the time, the loud hyperactive cartoon
character has little in common with the real life animal.[184] After a few shorts between 1957 and 1964, the
character was retired until the 1990s, when he gained his own show, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taz-Mania"] Taz-Mania, and again became
popular.[185] In 1997, a newspaper report noted that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros."] Warner Bros. had "trademarked the character and
registered the name Tasmanian Devil", and that this trademark "was policed", including an eight-year legal
case to allow a Tasmanian company to call a fishing lure "Tasmanian Devil". Debate followed, and a
delegation from the Tasmanian government met with Warner Bros.[186] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Groom"] Ray Groom, the Tourism Minister,
later announced that a "verbal agreement" had been reached. An annual fee would be paid to Warner Bros.
in return for the Government of Tasmania being able to use the image of Taz for "marketing purposes".
This agreement later disappeared.[187] In 2006, Warner Bros. permitted the Government of Tasmania to sell
stuffed toys of Taz with profits funnelled into research on DFTD.[188]
