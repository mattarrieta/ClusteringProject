Apple cake
Apple cakes are cakes in which [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apples"] apples feature as a
main flavour and ingredient. Such [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cakes"] cakes incorporate
apples in a variety of forms, including diced, pureed, or
stewed, and can include common additions like raisins,
nuts, and 'sweet' [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice"] spices such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon"] cinnamon or nutmeg.
They are a common and popular dessert worldwide,
thanks to millennia of apple cultivation in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"] Asia and
Europe, and their widespread introduction and
propagation throughout the Americas during the
 Columbian Exchange and colonisation. As a result,
apple desserts, including cakes, have a huge number of
variations.
Apples are also used in other cakes to add moisture and
sweetness, often as a partial substitute for refined sugar.

Varieties
British & Irish
Regions of Great Britain and Ireland have the ideal climate for apple growing, making apple cake a
common dessert with many regional varieties throughout. However, it is in the traditionally agricultural
 West Country of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"] England that apple cakes have been raised as culinary symbols of their counties, such as
 Dorset apple cake,[1] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonshire"] Devonshire apple cake, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset"] Somerset apple cake.[1] They are characterised by the use
of wholemeal flour and often a combination of dessert apples and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bramley_apple"] Bramley apples, and are typically served
warm with cream or custard, or more rarely, with cheese.
Polish
An apple cake called szarlotka or jabłecznik is a common traditional dessert in Poland, made from sweet
pastry crust and spiced apple filling. It can be topped with kruszonka (crumbles), meringue, or a dusting of
caster (powdered) sugar. An additional layer of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budino"] budyń (a Polish variation of custard) can sometimes be

found. In restaurants and cafes, it is usually served hot with whipped cream
and coffee.
Scandinavian
In Scandinavia, apple cakes are typically prepared from sour apples and
baked in a dough made from sugar, butter, flour, eggs, and baking powder.
The cake is then topped with apples, cinnamon and sugar, sometimes also
chopped almonds. Apple crumble pie is also common.
