Ballokume
Ballokume is an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_cuisine"] Albanian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookie"] cookie originating in the
city of Elbasan, which is popular throughout [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania"] Albania
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_diaspora"] Albanian communities. It is traditionally eaten on
 Dita e Verës, an Albanian pagan holiday celebrated on
14 March.[1] It is sometimes called kulaç me finj, as it
may optionally contain finj, a mixture of ashes from a
wood stove boiled in water.[2]
It consists of butter, sugar, eggs, and cornflour. It is
traditionally [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneading"] kneaded in a copper bowl, which is
supposed to improve the texture of the dough.[2] The
dough must be kneaded vigorously, which is why the
men of the house are often involved in the ballokume
preparation.[3] 
Ballokume also known as Ballokume Elbasani.
Etymology
Tradition holds that the name comes from a 16 century Ottoman ruler of Elbasan who, after having tasted a
small cake made from corn flour cooked in a wood fire, exclaimed: “Është ba si llokume!” (“It’s as good as
a lokum!“), the word ballokume resulting by contracting this sentence.[3]
