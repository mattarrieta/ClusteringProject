History
The preparation of applesauce cake dates back to early [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_history_of_the_United_States"] colonial times in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Colonies"] New England Colonies of the
northeastern United States.[1] From 1900 to the 1950s,[2] recipes for applesauce cake frequently appeared
in American cookbooks.[3] In the United States, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_food_days#United_States"] National Applesauce Cake Day occurs annually on June
6.[4]
Ingredients and preparation
Applesauce cake is a dessert cake prepared using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_sauce"] apple sauce, flour
and sugar as main ingredients. Store-bought or homemade
applesauce may be used in its preparation.[5] Additional ingredients
include eggs, butter, margarine or oil, raisins, dates, chopped apple,
chopped nuts (such as walnuts and pecans), cocoa powder, and
spices such as  cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and
allspice.[1][6][7][8][9][10][11] Some versions include dried or fresh,
finely grated ginger.[12][13] After baking, applesauce cake is
sometimes topped with an icing,[7] frosting or glaze, such as a
caramel glaze.[12][14] It also may be served topped with a dusting
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powdered_sugar"] confectioner's sugar[15][16] or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipped_cream"] whipped cream.[17] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten-free"] Gluten-free
applesauce cake can be prepared using rice flour.[18]

Applesauce cake tends to be moist due to the liquid content present in the apple sauce.[8] However, using a
chunky-style apple sauce can result in a cake with less moisture than from using standard apple-sauce.[19]
Letting it sit for one or two days before serving can increase its flavor,[a][b] as this allows time for the
ingredients to intermingle within the cake.
It can be prepared using various types of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_pan"] cake pans, such as a ring-shaped [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundt_cake"] bundt cake using a bundt
pan,[21][22] in loaf form using a loaf pan, or as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheet_cake"] sheet cake with a sheet cake pan.[20] Applesauce cake is
sometimes prepared in the form of cupcakes.[13][14]
Variations
Applesauce cake may be prepared and served as a type of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_cake"] coffee cake,[23] which may include a sweet
crumb topping.[24] Simple versions may be prepared using prepared coffee cake mix, apple sauce, and
other various ingredients.[11] Fruits such as blueberries, cranberries and raisins may also be used in
applesauce coffee cake.[25][26][27]
