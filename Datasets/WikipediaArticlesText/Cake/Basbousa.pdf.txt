Basbousa is the dessert's Egyptian name and it is called the same in North Africa. It is often called
"hareesa" in the Levant, and also the Egyptian city of Alexandria, though in other parts of Egypt hareesa is
a different type of dessert. Also note that "haressa" in North Africa is a spicy red sauce. Basbousa is a
popular dessert among all Egyptians; it is a main Egyptian dish in Eid and Ramadan, and for Christians
when they are fasting, such for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lent"] Great Lent and Nativity, as it can be made vegan.

Variations
Pastūsha (sometimes stylized as pastūçha) is a variant of
basbousa that originated in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait"] Kuwait in the 2010s.[5] Like
basbousa, it is made from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semolina"] semolina soaked in sweet syrup. It is
characterized by the addition of finely ground [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistachio"] pistachios and
orange flower water.
Basbousa bil ashta – a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant"] Levantine variation of basbousa filled
with ashta cream in the middle.
Vegan Basbousa - Now in modern times, Basbusa is also
available in vegan form using apple sauce to bind the base mix
together instead of dairy and eggs.
