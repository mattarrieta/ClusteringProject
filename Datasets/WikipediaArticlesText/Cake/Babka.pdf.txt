popular in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"] Israel (often referred to as simply a yeast cake: ‎עוגת

 Cookbook: Babka
Babka developed in the Jewish communities of Eastern Europe in
the early 19th century. Extra challah dough was rolled up with fruit
jam or cinnamon and baked as a loaf alongside the challah.[3]
Chocolate was not originally used, as it was not generally available;
the chocolate babka was likely a mid-20th century American
development.[9] Its name (though not necessarily the dish itself)
may be related to a type of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_bread#Baba"] Easter cake popular in Poland and
western Ukraine known as baba or the diminutive babka, which
means "grandmother" in Polish, related to the Yiddish bubbe.[3]

Although the Polish and Ukrainian babka are mutually eponymous
with their Jewish counterparts, the appearance and preparation of
each babka is drastically different. The Eastern European babka 
A chocolate babka made with a
dough similar to challah, and topped
with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streusel"] streusel
draws its name from its tall, stout, fluted sides formed in a
traditional pan, and reminiscent of a grandma's skirt. In comparison, the variant introduced to Western
culture by emigres to New York consists of strands of rich yeasted dough interwoven and baked in a loaf
tin.[7][8]
Babka was mostly unheard of outside of the Polish Jewish community until the latter part of the 20th
century. European-style bakeries started to offer it in late 1950s Israel and in the US. In addition to
chocolate, various fillings including poppy seeds, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almond_paste"] almond paste, cheese, and others became popular, and
some bakers began to top it with streusel.[3]

The popularity of babka has continued to increase across the United States, especially in New York, where
a popular Israeli bakery from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv"] Tel Aviv owned by Gadi Peleg,[10] Breads Bakery, opened a location and
began to sell their babka[11] filled with traditional fillings such as cinnamon, as well as non-traditional
fillings such as Nutella, apple, and cheesecake, as well as a savory version with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Za%27atar"] za'atar and feta cheese.
They became well known for their chocolate babka.[12][13]
Preparation
It consists of either an enriched or laminated dough; which are similar to those used for challah, and
 croissants respectively, that has been rolled out and spread with a variety of sweet fillings such as chocolate,
cinnamon sugar, apples, sweet cheese, Nutella, mohn, or raisins, which is then braided either as an open or
closed plait, topped with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_syrup"] sugar syrup in order to preserve freshness and make the bread moister.[14] It is
sometimes topped with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streusel"] streusel topping.
Variations
Israeli style
Israeli style babka (‎שמרים ‎עוגת) is made with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminated_dough"] laminated dough, enriched with butter, which is then
folded and rolled multiple times to create many distinct layers, similar to that used for Israeli style rugelach,
and also [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croissant"] croissant dough. Israeli style babka is available with a wider array of fillings and shapes. It is most
often shaped into a loaf pan, but it is also sometimes made into individual babkas, a pie-shaped babka,
formed into a ring shape, or braided and baked free form or formed into individual twists similar to a cheese
straw. The most popular fillings are chocolate which is commonly made with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashachar_Ha%27ole"] Hashachar Ha'ole (an Israeli
chocolate spread), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poppy_seed_filling"] mohn (a sweetened poppy seed paste filling), and sweet cheese typically made with
 gvina levana. They are rarely topped with a streusel topping. It is typically sweet; however, savory versions
are also popular in Israel, often containing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labneh"] labneh and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Za%27atar"] za'atar.[15] It is also often baked as "roses",
individual pastries shaped to resemble a rose. They may also be made with a closed plait, versus the more
common open plait.[16]
