Barnes Opening
Barnes Opening (sometimes called Gedult's Opening) is a
 chess opening where White opens with:
1. [URL: "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess_Opening_Theory/1._f3"] f3
The opening is named after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Wilson_Barnes"] Thomas Wilson Barnes (1825–
1874), an English player who had an impressive eight wins
over [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy"] Paul Morphy, including one game where Barnes
answered 1.e4 with 1...f6, known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes_Defence"] Barnes Defence.
Along with several other uncommon first moves, it is classified
under the code A00 ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_openings_(chess)"] irregular openings or uncommon
openings) in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopaedia_of_Chess_Openings"] Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings.

Strategy
Of the twenty possible first moves in chess, author and grandmaster [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmar_Mednis"] Edmar Mednis argues that 1.f3 is the
worst.[1] Grandmaster [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Finegold"] Benjamin Finegold teaches "Never play f3".[2] In his text on openings, Paul van der
Sterren considered 1. f3 beneath mention by name:
Then there are those moves with which White really tries to shoot himself in the foot, like 1. f3
or 1. g4. Out of loyalty to those unfortunates who have occasionally indulged in these strange
moves in their youth, I shall not even give you the names of these 'openings'.
— van der Sterren, on 1. f3[3]
The move does exert influence over the central square e4, but the same or more ambitious goals can be
achieved with almost any other first move. The move 1.f3 does not [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#develop"] develop a piece, opens no [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#lines"] lines for
pieces, and actually hinders the development of White's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#king_knight"] king knight by denying it its most natural square,
f3. It also weakens White's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#kingside"] kingside [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn_structure"] pawn structure, opens the e1–h4 diagonal against White's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling"] uncastled
king, and opens the g1–a7 diagonal against White's potential kingside castling position.[4]
Since 1.f3 is a poor move, it is not played often. Nonetheless, it is probably not the rarest opening move.
After 1.f3 e5 some players even continue with the nonsensical 2.Kf2, one of several sequences of opening
moves known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bongcloud_Attack"] Bongcloud Attack. It can also be known as the Fried Fox Attack, Wandering King
Page 2
Opening, The Hammerschlag, Tumbleweed, the Pork Chop Opening, or the Half Bird as it is often
 called in the United Kingdom, due to its opening move f3 being half that of the f4 employed in Bird's
Opening. One example of this is the game Simon Williams versus Martin Simons in the last round of the
British Championship 1999, where Williams had nothing to play for.[5] In 2020, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen"] Magnus Carlsen played
2.Kf2 against [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_So"] Wesley So in a blitz game, for the psychological effect. So commented, "It's hard to forget
the game when someone plays f3 and Kf2 and just crushes you. That's so humiliating."[6] Also played is
2.e4, called the King's Head Opening.
Black can secure a comfortable advantage by the normal means – advancing central pawns and rapidly
developing pieces to assert control over the centre.
If Black replies 1...e5, the game might proceed into a passive line known as the Blue Moon Defence. It
usually occurs after the moves 1.f3 e5 2.Nh3 d5 3.Nf2 (avoiding 3...Bxh3 4.gxh3 weakening the kingside)
3...Nf6 4.e3 Nc6 5.Be2 Bc5 6.0-0 0-0. White has no stake in the centre, but hopes to make a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#hole"] hole to break
into.
If White plays poorly and leaves too many [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#open_lines"] lines open against their king after 2.Kf2, they might be quickly
checkmated. One example: 1.f3 d5 2.Kf2 e5 (Black places two pawns in the centre to prepare for quick
development) 3.e4 Bc5+ 4.Kg3 Qg5#.

Barnes Opening can lead to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fool%27s_mate"] Fool's mate, 1.f3 e5 2.g4 Qh4#. Of all of White's legal moves on their second
move, only one allows [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkmate"] mate in one, while another, 2.h3, allows mate in two.
