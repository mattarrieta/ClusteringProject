 The Van 't Kruijs[1] Opening (Dutch pronunciation: [vɑn ət
ˈkrœys]) is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_opening"] chess opening defined by the move:
1. [URL: "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess_Opening_Theory/1._e3"] e3
It is named after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people"] Dutch player Maarten van 't Kruijs (1813–
1885) who won the sixth [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Chess_Championship"] Dutch championship in 1878. As this
 opening move is rarely played, it is considered an irregular
opening, and thus it is classified under the A00 code in the
 Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings.

The Van 't Kruijs Opening is not popular. According to ChessBase, it ranks eleventh in popularity out of
the twenty possible first moves. It releases the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#king's_bishop"] king's bishop, and makes a modest claim in the centre, but
the move is somewhat passive compared to much more common [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Pawn_Game"] King's Pawn Game (1. e4). The queen's
bishop's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#development"] development is somewhat obstructed by the pawn on e3, and White usually wants to take more
than a modest stake of the centre.
Although not very aggressive for a first move, play may [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_(chess)"] transpose to lines of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Opening"] English Opening (c2–c4),
 Queen's Pawn Game (d2–d4), or reversed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence"] French Defense (delayed d2–d4), reversed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Defence"] Dutch Defense (f2–
f4) positions or the modern variation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larsen%27s_Opening#Main_lines"] Larsen's Opening (b2-b3).
There are a few experimental moves that can be tried, however. For example, after 1.e3 e5, White can play
2.e4![URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_annotation_symbols#!?"] ?, therefore making it a truly reversed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_King%27s_Pawn_Opening"] Double King's Pawn Opening (or Open Game) it's called King's
Isa Reverse Opening. This is often used when White has much knowledge of the opening when playing as
Black. Therefore, this can be used to ensnare a few opponents into traps. However, since this gives the first
move advantage to Black straight away, this is not recommended. Similarly, 1.e3 f5 2.e4 goes to a reversed
 From's Gambit, where White is practically playing as Black.
The Van't Kruijs Opening is not a common choice for grandmasters, but its ability to transpose into many
different openings explains its attraction for some players such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_people"] Czech grandmaster [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavel_Blatny"] Pavel Blatny,
 Aron Nimzowitsch,[2] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bent_Larsen"] Bent Larsen.
