1.c3
A00
This opening became popular in the Saragossa chess club (Zaragoza, Spain) in 1919. The next year club
member José Juncosa analyzed the opening in Revista del Club Argentino.[1] In 1922 a theme tournament
 requiring the players to open with 1.c3 was arranged in Mannheim with three participants, Siegbert
Tarrasch, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Leonhardt"] Paul Leonhardt and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Mieses"] Jacques Mieses, which Tarrasch won.
Basics
The opening of 1.c3 seems at first to be an unambitious move. It opens a diagonal for the queen, but it
makes only a timid claim to the center. It prepares to play d4, but White could simply have played that
move immediately. Also, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pawn_(chess)"] pawn on c3 has the apparent disadvantage of taking the c3-square away from
the knight.
It is not a terrible move, however, because it is likely to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_(chess)"] transpose into many solid systems, including a
reversed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caro-Kann_Defence"] Caro-Kann Defence or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slav_Defense"] Slav Defense (but with an extra tempo for White); the Exchange Variation
 of the Queen's Gambit Declined, after 1.c3 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.cxd4 d5; to a solid but passive type of Queen's
Pawn Game after 1.c3 Nf6 2.d4 or 1.c3 d5 2.d4; or to a reversed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Defense"] Scandinavian Defense after 1.c3 e5 2.d4
exd4 3.Qxd4!? Nc6 4.Qa4; as well as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponziani_Opening"] Ponziani and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_Game"] Center Game openings, to name just a few.
Black has a number of responses, the most common (and effective) being 1...d5, 1...e5, and 1...Nf6. After
1...d5, White can essay the Plano Gambit, 2.e4?!, in effect an unusual response to the Scandinavian
Defense. After 2...dxe4, 3.Qa4+ recovers the pawn, but Black gets quick development with 3...Nc6
4.Qxe4 Nf6 5.Qc2 e5. Also reasonable is 1...f5, when 2.d4 transposes into a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Defense"] Dutch Defense where White
has played the passive move c3.

The reply 1...c5 is also playable, but gives White more opportunity than other moves to transpose into
standard openings where he may have a small advantage. The move 1...c5 2.e4 transposes into the Alapin
Variation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence"] Sicilian Defence. The sequence 1...c5 2.d4 is also possible, when 2...cxd4 (2...e6 3.e4 d5,
transposing into a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Defence"] French Defence after 4.e5 or 4.exd5, is also possible) 3.cxd4 d5 transposes into a regular
Exchange Variation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slav_Defense"] Slav Defense (usually reached by 1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.cxd5 cxd5), which gives
White a slight advantage.
The move 1...Nc6 is also possible, as it transposes into the 1.Nc3
system (with colors reversed), where Black embarks on a rather
dubious plan with c6 and d5. After 2.d4 d5, Black seems to be
holding the admittedly unusual position without particular
difficulties.
