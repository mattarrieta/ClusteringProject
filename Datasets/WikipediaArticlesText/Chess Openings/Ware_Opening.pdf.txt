Meadow Hay Opening
The Ware Opening attacks the b5-square and prepares to bring the a1-rook into the game. The b5-square is
non-essential and if Black plays [URL: "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess_Opening_Theory/1._a4/1...e5"] 1...e5, the f8-bishop prevents the development of the white rook for the
moment. The reply 1...e5 also gains space for Black in the center, a typical objective of most openings but
one completely ignored by the Ware Opening. Noting all this, the Ware Opening is normally seen played
only by players completely new to chess.
An experienced player using the Ware Opening will usually meet a response of 1...d5 or 1...e5 with 2.d4 or
2.e4, respectively, since a reversed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_Defense"] Scandinavian or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Englund_Gambit"] Englund Gambit would be unsound here. After 1...d5
2.Nf3, 2...Nf6 is recommended, since a reversed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Gambit#Fajarowicz_variation_3...Ne4"] Fajarowicz can arise after 2...c5 3.e4!? dxe4 4.Ne5 where
a4 has some utility.[1]
In the 2012 World Blitz Championship, 1.a4 was employed as a little joke by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen"] Magnus Carlsen against
 Teimour Radjabov, who during the blitz championship two years earlier had told him "Everyone is getting
tired. You might as well start with 1.a4 and you can still beat them." The game soon turned into a sort of
 Four Knights Game where Carlsen finally prevailed.[2]
Carlson played this in the blitz portion of the 2022 Norway chess tournament, ultimately losing to Wesley
So.
Variations
There are several named variations of the Ware Opening. The best known of these are:
Page 2
1...e5 2.a5 d5 3.e3 f5 4.a6 (Ware Gambit). [3] In this variation, White attempts to create an
 open a-file in exchange for a pawn.
1...e5 2.h4 (Crab Variation). This version is generally chosen more for its aesthetic
considerations than its strategic ones; white's pawns extend like a crab's pincers, preparing
to attack on the sides.
1...b6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Nd7 (Cologne Gambit).[4]
1...b5 2.axb5 Bb7 (Wing Gambit of the Ware Opening).[3]
1...a5 (Symmetric Variation).
