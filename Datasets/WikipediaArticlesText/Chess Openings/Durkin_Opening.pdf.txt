the Sodium Attack) is a rarely played [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_opening"] chess opening.
1. [URL: "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess_Opening_Theory/1._Na3"] Na3
The Durkin Opening is named for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_T._Durkin&action=edit&redlink=1"] Robert T. Durkin (1923–?)
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey"] New Jersey. The name "Sodium Attack" comes from the
algebraic notation 1.Na3, as Na is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_symbol"] chemical symbol for the
element sodium. White may follow up by playing c4,[1] e.g.
1...d5 2.c4 dxc4 3.Nxc4.

This development of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#queen's_knight"] queen's knight does little to utilize White's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-move_advantage_in_chess"] advantage of the first move. On a3 the
knight does not control [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#central"] central squares, and White would have to move this knight again (e.g., to c2 or c4)
for it to follow common rules such as controlling the center. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Dunnington"] Angus Dunnington suggests that combining
this with a gradual central expansion should give White a reasonable position.[2]
