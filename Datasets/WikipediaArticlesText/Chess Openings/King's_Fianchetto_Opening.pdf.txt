bishop".[1] Included among these are the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Opening"] Catalan Opening, the

Theory
By playing 1. g3, White prepares to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianchetto"] fianchetto their bishop along the long diagonal and also to push e4
since the bishop is supporting that square. White can also play Nf3 in the future, then [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling"] castle kingside to
transpose into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Attack"] King's Indian Attack. This opening generally leads to closed positions, and White can

also build up a strong kingside attack.
