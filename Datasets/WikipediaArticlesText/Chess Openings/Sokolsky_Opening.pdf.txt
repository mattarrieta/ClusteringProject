Sokolsky Opening
The Sokolsky Opening (also known as the Orangutan or
Polish Opening) is an uncommon [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_opening"] chess opening that begins
with the move:
1. [URL: "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess_Opening_Theory/1._b4"] b4
According to various databases, out of the twenty possible first
moves from White, the move 1.b4 ranks ninth in popularity.[1]
It is considered an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_chess_openings"] irregular opening, so it is classified under
the A00 code in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopaedia_of_Chess_Openings"] Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO).

The opening has never been popular at the top level, though a number of prominent players have employed
 it on occasion (for example, Richard Réti against Abraham Speijer in Scheveningen 1923 and Boris
 Spassky against Vasily Smyslov in the 1960 Moscow–Leningrad match). Soviet player Alexei Pavlovich
Sokolsky (1908–1969) wrote a monograph on this opening in 1963, Debyut 1 b2–b4. In May 2021, world
champion [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Carlsen"] Magnus Carlsen essayed the opening against GMs [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikaru_Nakamura"] Hikaru Nakamura and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_So"] Wesley So in the
online [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champions_Chess_Tour_2021#FTX_Crypto_Cup"] FTX Crypto Cup rapid tournament.[2]
 Perhaps its most famous use came in the game Tartakower versus Maróczy, in the New York 1924 chess
tournament on March 21, 1924.[3] The name "Orangutan Opening" originates from that game: the players
visited the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_Zoo"] Bronx Zoo the previous day, where Tartakower consulted an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangutan"] orangutan named Susan, and she
somehow indicated, Tartakower insisted, that he should open with b4. Also, Tartakower noted that the
climbing movement of the pawn to b5 reminded him of the orangutan. In that particular game, Tartakower
came out of the opening with a decent position, but the game was drawn.[4][5] Alekhine, who played in the
tournament and wrote a book on it, said that 1.b4 was an old move, and that the problem is that it reveals
White's intentions, before White knows what Black's intentions are.[6]
The opening is largely based upon tactics on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#queenside"] queenside or the f6- and g7-squares. Black can respond in
a variety of ways: For example, a common response is for Black to make a claim on the centre, which
White's first move ignores, with 1...e5 (it is normal for White to ignore the attack on the b-pawn and play
2.Bb2, where 2...d6, 2...f6, and 2...Bxb4 are all playable), 1...d5 (possibly followed by 2.Bb2 Qd6,
attacking b4 and supporting ...e7–e5),[7] or 1...f5. Less ambitious moves like 1...Nf6, 1...c6 (called the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Alekhine"]
Page 2
Outflank Variation, preparing ...Qb6 or ...a5), and 1...e6 are also
reasonable. Rarer attempts have been made with 1...a5 or 1...c5.
Black's reply 1...e6 is usually followed by ...d5, ...Nf6 and an
eventual ...c5. After 1...a5 White will most likely play 2.b5 and take
advantage of Black's queenside weakness. Black's 1...c5 is much
sharper and more aggressive and is normally used to avoid theory.
After the capture Black will generally place pressure on the c5-
square and will develop an attack against White's weak queenside
structure at the cost of an inferior central position.
