Description
 White's 1.d3 releases their c1-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_(chess)"] bishop and makes a modest claim for the centre, but since it does not stake
out as large a share of the centre as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Pawn_Game"] 1.d4 does, it is not a popular opening move. Of the twenty possible first
moves for White, it ranks tenth in popularity. Nevertheless, since 1...d6 is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#playable"] playable by Black against any
opening move from White,[1] the corresponding move is playable by White as well. Its ability to transpose
into a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Attack"] King's Indian Attack setup is also important to consider. Black has many reasonable responses, such
as 1...e5, 1...d5, 1...c5, 1...Nf6, and 1...g6.
 The most famous use of this opening was in the third game in the Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov match
in 1997. Kasparov believed that the computer would play the opening poorly if it had to rely on its own
skills rather than on its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_opening_book_(computers)"] opening book. The game was drawn.[2] It had been previously used by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Levy_(chess_player)"] David Levy
in a 1984 prize match against [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray_Blitz"] Cray Blitz, which Levy won.[3]
