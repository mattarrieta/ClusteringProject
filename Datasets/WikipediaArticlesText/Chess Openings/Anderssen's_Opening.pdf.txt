Anderssen's Opening
Anderssen's Opening is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_opening"] chess opening defined by the
opening move:
1. [URL: "https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Chess_Opening_Theory/1._a3"] a3
 Anderssen's Opening is named after unofficial World Chess
Champion [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Anderssen"] Adolf Anderssen, who played it thrice[1][2][3] in his
1858 match against [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy"] Paul Morphy. Although Anderssen was
defeated decisively in the match, the games he opened with the
 novelty scored 1½/3 (one win, one loss, one draw).
Anderssen's Opening is not commonly played, and is an
 irregular opening. The move is classified under the A00 code
in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopaedia_of_Chess_Openings"] Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings.  Anderssen's
Opening is also the very first opening enumerated in the
Oxford Companion to Chess' index of 1327 openings, due to a
systematic ordering which begins at White's  left-hand
 queenside and proceeds to White's right-hand kingside.[4]

Themes
Anderssen's Opening does little in the way of development or control of the center, and is rather more of a
 waiting move. However some players may enjoy the psychological value of such a move, or believe it will
help them against an opponent with superior knowledge of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_theory#Opening_theory"] opening theory.
Among the more common Black responses to Anderssen's Opening are:
1...d5, which makes a straightforward claim on the center,
1...g6, which prepares to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianchetto"] fianchetto the king's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_(chess)"] bishop to g7,
Page 2
1...e5, also playable, although White can then play 2.c4 (as occurred in the Morphy-
Anderssen match), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_(chess)"] transposing to a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Opening#Reversed_Sicilian"] Reversed Sicilian structure where a pawn on a3 may be
useful. Another approach is 2.e4 Nf6 3.Nc3, transposing to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna_Game#3.a3"] Mengarini's Opening.
Morphy vs. Anderssen, 1858
Anderssen (left) and Morphy (right) 
During his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Morphy#Europe"] tour of Europe and in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas"] Christmastime
(December 20-28) of 1858, the American master
Paul Morphy engaged Adolf Anderssen in a match
held at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B4tel_de_Breteuil"] Hôtel de Breteuil, Paris. The terms were
that the first player to win seven games would be the
winner of the match—draws would not count
towards a win. The players took turns controlling the
white pieces and the black pieces in each game, with
Morphy playing as White in the first game. Although
Anderssen won the first game in a laborious effort
requiring 72 moves and about 7 hours of play,
Morphy established dominance by winning three
subsequent, shorter games.
Anderssen then employed the opening which came to bear his name in three consecutive games where he
controlled the white pieces—the sixth, the eighth, and the tenth. As the match progressed his performance
with the opening improved, losing the sixth, drawing the eighth, and finally securing a win in the tenth
game. However this proved insufficient to prevent Morphy's win—game and match—in the eleventh.
Chess writer Philip W. Sergeant documented the match in a compilation of Morphy's games.[5]
All three games opened identically through their seventh moves. In each the players transposed to a
Reversed Sicilian structure, exchanging pawns. White developed his knights, and Black activated his
 bishop pair before [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling"] castling kingside.
Game 6
December 24. Although the players maintained equal exchange
of material throughout most of the game, Sergeant noted certain
late moves of White's queen and rook as blunders, which
allowed Black to bring his material and positional advantage to
bear. Using all of his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#major_piece"] major pieces, Black checked with an
immediate mating threat, at which point White resigned. In the
final position, Black was up a rook.

December 25. The eighth game proceeded identically with the
sixth a bit further than all three in common, through White's
 eleventh move. On his eighteenth move White played an en
passant capture; according to Sergeant, Black made the capture
necessary for White in order that White should avoid the
problem of two black pawns against one white pawn along the
queenside flank. During the middlegame, the players
exchanged queens. Again equality of material was maintained
throughout the middlegame, albeit that pairwise exchanges of
pawns and bishops were delayed by several moves.

The final position of game 8. 
During the endgame, slight material inequality and the given
position resulted in a draw, as White managed to halt the
advance of two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_chess#passed_pawn"] passed pawns—and the black king which
might have aided their advance. The final moves involved the
white knight and the black king repeating the board position
twice, threatening draw by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threefold_repetition"] threefold repetition. In the final position White had a knight for Black's two
passed pawns.

Game 10
December 27. In the tenth game Anderssen finally converted 1.
a3 to a second and final win, although the game required the
most moves of any played during the match. Again, material
equality was maintained during the middlegame, except that
White retained a bishop for Black's knight throughout the
phase. This allowed White to use his bishop pair
advantageously. In the endgame White won three pawns and a
knight in exchange for a rook, forcing Black to defend against
White's three passed pawns, which proved unmanageable,
forcing Morphy's resignation. In the final position White had a
bishop and two passed pawns for Black's rook.

Later use
According to Sergeant,[6] Anderssen later essayed the unusual opening in 1877 and 1878, using it to win
games against [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Paulsen"] Louis Paulsen,[7] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Henry_Mackenzie"] George Henry Mackenzie,[8] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mason_(chess_player)"] James Mason.[9] 1. a3 was also used
occasionally by other players of the period: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Steinitz"] Steinitz vs. Blackburne, Vienna 1873,[10] Blackburne
(unsuccessfully) vs. Lee, London 1904,[11] and (also unsuccessfully) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Mieses"] Mieses vs. Cohn, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostend"] Ostend 1907.[12]
A modern proponent of the move is Croatian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Master"] International Master [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zvonko_Kre%C4%8Dak&action=edit&redlink=1"] Dr. Zvonko Krečak.[13] In March 2010
 Magnus Carlsen played the opening in the blindfold game against Vassily Ivanchuk at the Amber chess
tournament; Carlsen lost the game.[14]
