Antiderivative
In calculus, an antiderivative,  inverse derivative,  primitive
function, primitive integral or indefinite integral[Note 1] of a
 function f is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_function"] differentiable function F whose [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"] derivative is equal to
the original function f.  This can be stated symbolically as
F' = f.[1][2] The process of solving for antiderivatives is called
antidifferentiation (or indefinite integration),  and its opposite
operation is called differentiation, which is the process of finding a
 derivative. Antiderivatives are often denoted by capital Roman
letters such as F and G.
 Antiderivatives are related to definite integrals through the second
fundamental theorem of calculus: the definite integral of a function
over a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)"] closed interval where the function is Riemann integrable is
equal to the difference between the values of an antiderivative
evaluated at the endpoints of the interval.
In physics, antiderivatives arise in the context of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectilinear_motion"] rectilinear motion
(e.g., in explaining the relationship between position, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_(physics)"] velocity and
acceleration).[3] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics"] discrete equivalent of the notion of
antiderivative is antidifference.

Examples
The function is an antiderivative of  , since the derivative of  is  , and since the
derivative of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_function"] constant is zero, will have an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_set"] infinite number of antiderivatives, such as
, etc. Thus, all the antiderivatives of can be obtained by changing the value of c in
Page 2
, where c is an arbitrary constant known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_of_integration"] constant of integration. Essentially, the
 graphs of antiderivatives of a given function are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_translation"] vertical translations of each other, with each graph's
vertical location depending upon the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(mathematics)"] value c.
More generally, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_function"] power function
if n = −1. 
has antiderivative if n ≠ −1, and
In physics, the integration of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"] acceleration yields [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"] velocity plus a constant. The constant is the initial velocity
term that would be lost upon taking the derivative of velocity, because the derivative of a constant term is
zero. This same pattern applies to further integrations and derivatives of motion (position, velocity,
acceleration, and so on).[3]
Uses and properties
Antiderivatives can be used to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral#Calculating_integrals"] compute definite integrals, using the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus"] fundamental theorem of calculus: if F is
an antiderivative of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral"] integrable function f over the interval , then:
Because of this, each of the infinitely many antiderivatives of a given function f may be called the
"indefinite integral" of f and written using the integral symbol with no bounds:
If F is an antiderivative of f, and the function f is defined on some interval, then every other antiderivative
G of f differs from F by a constant: there exists a number c such that  for all x. c is
called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_of_integration"] constant of integration. If the domain of F is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint_union"] disjoint union of two or more (open) intervals,
then a different constant of integration may be chosen for each of the intervals. For instance
is the most general antiderivative of  on its natural domain
Every [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"] continuous function f has an antiderivative, and one antiderivative F is given by the definite integral
of f with variable upper boundary:
Varying the lower boundary produces other antiderivatives (but not necessarily all possible antiderivatives).
This is another formulation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus"] fundamental theorem of calculus.
There are many functions whose antiderivatives, even though they exist, cannot be expressed in terms of
 elementary functions (like polynomials, exponential functions, logarithms, trigonometric functions, inverse
trigonometric functions and their combinations). Examples of these are

From left to right, the functions are the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function"] error function, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresnel_function"] Fresnel function, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_integral"] sine integral, the
 logarithmic integral function and Sophomore's dream. For a more detailed discussion, see also Differential
Galois theory.
Techniques of integration
Finding antiderivatives of elementary functions is often considerably harder than finding their derivatives
(indeed, there is no pre-defined method for computing indefinite integrals).[4] For some elementary
functions, it is impossible to find an antiderivative in terms of other elementary functions. To learn more,
see [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_function_(differential_algebra)"] elementary functions and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonelementary_integral"] nonelementary integral.
There exist many properties and techniques for finding antiderivatives. These include, among others:
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity_of_integration"] linearity of integration (which breaks complicated integrals into simpler ones)
 Integration by substitution, often combined with trigonometric identities or the natural
logarithm
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_chain_rule_method"] inverse chain rule method (a special case of integration by substitution)
 Integration by parts (to integrate products of functions)
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function_integration"] Inverse function integration (a formula that expresses the antiderivative of the inverse f−1 of
an invertible and continuous function f, in terms of the antiderivative of f and of f−1).
 The method of partial fractions in integration (which allows us to integrate all rational
functions—fractions of two polynomials)
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risch_algorithm"] Risch algorithm
 Additional techniques for multiple integrations (see for instance double integrals, polar
coordinates, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant"] Jacobian and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem"] Stokes' theorem)
 Numerical integration (a technique for approximating a definite integral when no elementary
antiderivative exists, as in the case of exp(−x2))
Algebraic manipulation of integrand (so that other integration techniques, such as integration
by substitution, may be used)
 Cauchy formula for repeated integration (to calculate the n-times antiderivative of a function)
 Computer algebra systems can be used to automate some or all of the work involved in the symbolic
techniques above, which is particularly useful when the algebraic manipulations involved are very complex
or lengthy. Integrals which have already been derived can be looked up in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_integrals"] table of integrals.
Of non-continuous functions
Non-continuous functions can have antiderivatives. While there are still open questions in this area, it is
known that:
Some highly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_(mathematics)"] pathological functions with large sets of discontinuities may nevertheless have
antiderivatives.
Page 4
 In some cases, the antiderivatives of such pathological functions may be found by Riemann
integration, while in other cases these functions are not Riemann integrable.
Assuming that the domains of the functions are open intervals:
A necessary, but not sufficient, condition for a function f to have an antiderivative is that f
have the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem"] intermediate value property. That is, if [a, b] is a subinterval of the domain of f and
y is any real number between f(a) and f(b), then there exists a c between a and b such that
f(c) = y. This is a consequence of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darboux%27s_theorem_(analysis)"] Darboux's theorem.
The set of discontinuities of f must be a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meagre_set"] meagre set. This set must also be an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-sigma"] F-sigma set
(since the set of discontinuities of any function must be of this type). Moreover, for any
meagre F-sigma set, one can construct some function f having an antiderivative, which has
the given set as its set of discontinuities.
If f has an antiderivative, is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_function"] bounded on closed finite subintervals of the domain and has a
set of discontinuities of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_measure"] Lebesgue measure 0, then an antiderivative may be found by
integration in the sense of Lebesgue. In fact, using more powerful integrals like the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henstock%E2%80%93Kurzweil_integral"] Henstock–Kurzweil integral, every function for which an antiderivative exists is integrable,
and its general integral coincides with its antiderivative.
If f has an antiderivative F on a closed interval , then for any choice of partition
if one chooses sample points  as
specified by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_value_theorem"] mean value theorem, then the corresponding Riemann sum [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescoping_series"] telescopes to
the value  .
However if f is unbounded, or if f is bounded but the set of discontinuities of f has positive
Lebesgue measure, a different choice of sample points may give a significantly
different value for the Riemann sum, no matter how fine the partition. See Example 4
below.
Some examples
1. The function
with  is not continuous at  but has the antiderivative
with  . Since f is bounded on closed finite intervals and is only discontinuous at 0,
the antiderivative F may be obtained by integration: .
2. The function
Page 5
with  is not continuous at  but has the antiderivative
with  . Unlike Example 1, f(x) is unbounded in any interval containing 0, so the
Riemann integral is undefined.
3. If f(x) is the function in Example 1 and F is its antiderivative, and  is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_set"] dense
 countable [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset"] subset of the open interval then the function
has an antiderivative
The set of discontinuities of g is precisely the set  . Since g is bounded on closed
finite intervals and the set of discontinuities has measure 0, the antiderivative G may be
found by integration.
4. Let  be a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_set"] dense [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable"] countable subset of the open interval Consider the
everywhere continuous strictly increasing function
It can be shown that
for all values x where the series converges, and that the graph of F(x)
has vertical tangent lines at all other values of x. In particular the graph
has vertical tangent lines at all points in the set  .
Moreover for all x where the derivative is defined. It follows
that the inverse function

antiderivative G. On the other hand, it can not be true that 
Thus g has an
Page 6
since for any partition of  , one can choose sample points
for the Riemann sum from the set  , giving a value of 0 for
the sum. It follows that g has a set of discontinuities of positive
Lebesgue measure. Figure 1 on the right shows an approximation to
the graph of g(x) where  and the series is truncated Figure 2.
to 8 terms. Figure 2 shows the graph of an approximation to the
antiderivative G(x), also truncated to 8 terms. On the other hand if the
Riemann integral is replaced by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_integral"] Lebesgue integral, then [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatou%27s_lemma"] Fatou's lemma or the
 dominated convergence theorem shows that g does satisfy the fundamental theorem of
calculus in that context.
5. In Examples 3 and 4, the sets of discontinuities of the functions g are dense only in a finite
open interval However, these examples can be easily modified so as to have sets of
discontinuities which are dense on the entire real line  . Let
Then  has a dense set of discontinuities on  and has antiderivative
6. Using a similar method as in Example 5, one can modify g in Example 4 so as to vanish at
all [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_numbers"] rational numbers. If one uses a naive version of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral"] Riemann integral defined as the limit
of left-hand or right-hand Riemann sums over regular partitions, one will obtain that the
integral of such a function g over an interval is 0 whenever a and b are both rational,
instead of  . Thus the fundamental theorem of calculus will fail spectacularly.
7. A function which has an antiderivative may still fail to be Riemann integrable. The derivative
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volterra%27s_function"] Volterra's function is an example.

Notes
1. Antiderivatives are also called general integrals, and sometimes integrals. The latter term
 is generic, and refers not only to indefinite integrals (antiderivatives), but also to definite
integrals. When the word integral is used without additional specification, the reader is
supposed to deduce from the context whether it refers to a definite or indefinite integral.
Some authors define the indefinite integral of a function as the set of its infinitely many
possible antiderivatives. Others define it as an arbitrarily selected element of that set. This
article adopts the latter approach. In English A-Level Mathematics textbooks one can find
the term complete primitive - L. Bostock and S. Chandler (1978) Pure Mathematics 1; The
Page 7
solution of a differential equation including the arbitrary constant is called the general
solution (or sometimes the complete primitive).
