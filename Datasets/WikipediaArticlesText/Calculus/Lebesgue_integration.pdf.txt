Lebesgue integration
In mathematics, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"] integral of a non-negative [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"] function of a
single variable can be regarded, in the simplest case, as the
 area between the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function"] graph of that function and the x-axis. The
 Lebesgue integral, named after French mathematician Henri
Lebesgue, extends the integral to a larger class of functions.
It also extends the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_a_function"] domains on which these functions can be
defined.
Long before the 20th century, mathematicians already
understood that for non-negative functions with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_function"] smooth
enough graph—such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"] continuous functions on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_set"] closed
 bounded intervals—the area under the curve could be

defined as the integral, and computed using approximation
techniques on the region by polygons. However, as the need to consider more irregular functions arose—
e.g., as a result of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function"] limiting processes of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"] mathematical analysis and the mathematical [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_probability"] theory of probability
—it became clear that more careful approximation techniques were needed to define a suitable integral.
Also, one might wish to integrate on spaces more general than the real line. The Lebesgue integral provides
the necessary abstractions for this.
The Lebesgue integral plays an important role in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory"] probability theory, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis"] real analysis, and many other fields in
mathematics. It is named after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Lebesgue"] Henri Lebesgue (1875–1941), who introduced the integral (Lebesgue 1904).
It is also a pivotal part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_theory_of_probability"] axiomatic theory of probability.
The term Lebesgue integration can mean either the general theory of integration of a function with respect
to a general measure, as introduced by Lebesgue, or the specific case of integration of a function defined on
a sub-domain of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line"] real line with respect to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_measure"] Lebesgue measure.

Introduction
The integral of a positive function f between limits a and b can be interpreted as the area under the graph
of f. This is straightforward for functions such as polynomials, but what does it mean for more exotic
functions? In general, for which class of functions does "area under the curve" make sense? The answer to
this question has great theoretical and practical importance.
As part of a general movement toward [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_rigor"] rigor in mathematics in the nineteenth century, mathematicians
 attempted to put integral calculus on a firm foundation. The Riemann integral—proposed by Bernhard
Riemann (1826–1866)—is a broadly successful attempt to provide such a foundation. Riemann's definition
starts with the construction of a sequence of easily calculated areas that converge to the integral of a given
function. This definition is successful in the sense that it gives the expected answer for many already-solved
problems, and gives useful results for many other problems.
However, Riemann integration does not interact well with taking limits of sequences of functions, making
such limiting processes difficult to analyze. This is important, for instance, in the study of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series"] Fourier series,
 Fourier transforms, and other topics. The Lebesgue integral is better able to describe how and when it is
 possible to take limits under the integral sign (via the monotone convergence theorem and dominated
convergence theorem).
While the Riemann integral considers the area under a curve as made out of vertical rectangles, the
Lebesgue definition considers horizontal slabs that are not necessarily just rectangles, and so it is more
flexible. For this reason, the Lebesgue definition makes it possible to calculate integrals for a broader class
of functions. For example, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_function"] Dirichlet function, which is 0 where its argument is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational_number"] irrational and 1
otherwise, has a Lebesgue integral, but does not have a Riemann integral. Furthermore, the Lebesgue
integral of this function is zero, which agrees with the intuition that when picking a real number uniformly
at random from the unit interval, the probability of picking a rational number should be zero.
Lebesgue summarized his approach to integration in a letter to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Montel"] Paul Montel:
I have to pay a certain sum, which I have collected in my pocket. I take the bills and coins out
of my pocket and give them to the creditor in the order I find them until I have reached the
total sum. This is the Riemann integral. But I can proceed differently. After I have taken all the
money out of my pocket I order the bills and coins according to identical values and then I pay
the several heaps one after the other to the creditor. This is my integral.

The insight is that one should be able to rearrange the values of a function freely, while preserving the value
of the integral. This process of rearrangement can convert a very [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_(mathematics)"] pathological function into one that is
"nice" from the point of view of integration, and thus let such pathological functions be integrated.
Intuitive interpretation
Folland (1984) summarizes the difference between the Riemann
and Lebesgue approaches thus: "to compute the Riemann integral
of f, one partitions the domain [a, b] into subintervals", while in
the Lebesgue integral, "one is in effect partitioning the range of
f."[1]
For the Riemann integral, the domain is partitioned into intervals,
and bars are constructed to meet the height of the graph. The areas
of these bars are added together, and this approximates the integral,
in effect by summing areas of the form where is the
height of a rectangle and is its width.
For the Lebesgue integral, the range is partitioned into intervals,
and so the region under the graph is partitioned into horizontal
"slabs" (which may not be connected sets). The area of a small
horizontal "slab" under the graph of f, of height dy, is equal to the
measure of the slab's width times dy: 
A measurable function is shown,
together with the set
(on the x-axis). The Lebesgue
integral is obtained by slicing along
the y-axis, using the 1-dimensional
Lebesgue measure to measure the
"width" of the slices.
The Lebesgue integral may then be defined by adding up the areas of these horizontal slabs.
Simple functions
An equivalent way to introduce the Lebesgue integral is to use so-
called simple functions, which generalize the step functions of
Riemann integration. Consider, for example, determining the
cumulative COVID-19 case count from a graph of smoothed new
daily cases (right).
The Riemann–Darboux approach
Partition the domain (time period) into intervals (eight,
in the example at right) and construct bars with heights
that meet the graph. The cumulative count is found by
summing, over all bars, the product of interval width
(time in days) and the bar height (cases per day).
The Lebesgue approach
Choose a finite number of target values (eight, in the
example) in the range of the function. By constructing
bars with heights equal to these values, but below the
function, they imply a partitioning of the domain into
the same number of subsets (subsets, indicated by
color in the example, need not be connected). This is a
"simple function," as described below. The cumulative

Serbia (Summer-Fall 2021).
Page 4
count is found by summing, over all subsets of the domain, the product of the measure on
that subset (total time in days) and the bar height (cases per day).
Measure theory
 Measure theory was initially created to provide a useful abstraction of the notion of length of subsets of the
real line—and, more generally, area and volume of subsets of Euclidean spaces. In particular, it provided a
systematic answer to the question of which subsets of R have a length. As later [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory"] set theory developments
showed (see [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-measurable_set"] non-measurable set), it is actually impossible to assign a length to all subsets of R in a way
that preserves some natural additivity and translation invariance properties. This suggests that picking out a
suitable class of measurable subsets is an essential prerequisite.
The Riemann integral uses the notion of length explicitly. Indeed, the element of calculation for the
Riemann integral is the rectangle [a, b] × [c, d], whose area is calculated to be (b − a)(d − c). The
quantity b − a is the length of the base of the rectangle and d − c is the height of the rectangle. Riemann
could only use planar rectangles to approximate the area under the curve, because there was no adequate
theory for measuring more general sets.
In the development of the theory in most modern textbooks (after 1950), the approach to measure and
integration is axiomatic. This means that a measure is any function μ defined on a certain class X of subsets
of a set E, which satisfies a certain list of properties. These properties can be shown to hold in many
different cases.
Measurable functions
We start with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_space"] measure space (E, X, μ) where E is a set, X is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma-algebra"] σ-algebra of subsets of E, and μ is a
(non-negative) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"] measure on E defined on the sets of X.
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%A3-algebra"] For example, E can be Euclidean n-space Rn or some Lebesgue measurable subset of it, X is the σ-
algebra of all Lebesgue measurable subsets of E, and μ is the Lebesgue measure. In the mathematical
theory of probability, we confine our study to a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability"] probability measure μ, which satisfies μ(E) = 1.
Lebesgue's theory defines integrals for a class of functions called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_function"] measurable functions. A real-valued
function f on E is measurable if the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-image"] pre-image of every interval of the form (t, ∞) is in X:
We can show that this is equivalent to requiring that the pre-image of any [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borel_algebra"] Borel subset of R be in X. The
set of measurable functions is closed under algebraic operations, but more importantly it is closed under
various kinds of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_superior_and_limit_inferior"] point-wise sequential limits:
are measurable if the original sequence (fk)k, where k ∈ N, consists of measurable functions.
There are several approaches for defining an integral:
for measurable real-valued functions f defined on E.

Definition
The theory of the Lebesgue integral requires a theory of measurable sets and measures on these sets, as well
as a theory of measurable functions and integrals on these functions.
Via simple functions
One approach to constructing the Lebesgue integral is to make use
of so-called simple functions: finite, real linear combinations of
indicator functions. Simple functions that lie directly underneath a
given function f can be constructed by partitioning the range of f
into a finite number of layers. The intersection of the graph of f
with a layer identifies a set of intervals in the domain of f, which, 
Approximating a function by a simple
function.
taken together, is defined to be the preimage of the lower bound of
that layer, under the simple function. In this way, the partitioning of the range of f implies a partitioning of
its domain. The integral of a simple function is found by summing, over these (not necessarily connected)
subsets of the domain, the product of the measure of the subset and its image under the simple function (the
lower bound of the corresponding layer); intuitively, this product is the sum of the areas of all bars of the
same height. The integral of a non-negative general measurable function is then defined as an appropriate
 supremum of approximations by simple functions, and the integral of a (not necessarily positive)
measurable function is the difference of two integrals of non-negative measurable functions.
Indicator functions
To assign a value to the integral of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function"] indicator function 1S of a measurable set S consistent with the given
 measure μ, the only reasonable choice is to set:
Notice that the result may be equal to +∞, unless μ is a finite measure.
Simple functions
A finite [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination"] linear combination of indicator functions
where the coefficients ak are real numbers and Sk are disjoint measurable sets, is called a measurable
 simple function. We extend the integral by linearity to non-negative measurable simple functions. When the
coefficients ak are positive, we set
whether this sum is finite or +∞. A simple function can be written in different ways as a linear combination
of indicator functions, but the integral will be the same by the additivity of measures.
Page 6
Some care is needed when defining the integral of a real-valued simple function, to avoid the undefined
expression ∞ − ∞: one assumes that the representation
is such that μ(Sk) < ∞ whenever ak ≠ 0. Then the above formula for the integral of f makes sense, and
the result does not depend upon the particular representation of f satisfying the assumptions.
If B is a measurable subset of E and s is a measurable simple function one defines
Non-negative functions
Let f be a non-negative measurable function on E, which we allow to attain the value +∞, in other words,
f takes non-negative values in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_real_number_line"] extended real number line. We define
We need to show this integral coincides with the preceding one, defined on the set of simple functions,
when E  is a segment [a,  b]. There is also the question of whether this corresponds in any way to a
Riemann notion of integration. It is possible to prove that the answer to both questions is yes.
We have defined the integral of f for any non-negative extended real-valued measurable function on E. For
some functions, this integral ∫E f dμ is infinite.
It is often useful to have a particular sequence of simple functions that approximates the Lebesgue integral
well (analogously to a Riemann sum). For a non-negative measurable function f, let  be the simple
function whose value is  whenever  , for k a non-negative integer less
than (say) . Then it can be proven directly that
and that the limit on the right hand side exists as an extended real number. This bridges the connection
between the approach to the Lebesgue integral using simple functions, and the motivation for the Lebesgue
integral using a partition of the range.
Signed functions
To handle signed functions, we need a few more definitions. If f is a measurable function of the set E to the
reals (including ±∞), then we can write
where
Page 7
Note that both f+ and f− are non-negative measurable functions. Also note that
We say that the Lebesgue integral of the measurable function f exists, or is defined if at least one of
and  is finite:
In this case we define
If
we say that f is Lebesgue integrable.
It turns out that this definition gives the desirable properties of the integral.
Via improper Riemann integral
Assuming that is measurable and non-negative, the function
 is monotonically non-increasing. The Lebesgue integral may then be defined as the improper Riemann
integral of :[2]
This integral is improper at
infinite.[3][4] 
and (possibly) also at zero. It exists, with the allowance that it may be
As above, the integral of a Lebesgue integrable (not necessarily non-negative) function is defined by
subtracting the integral of its positive and negative parts.
Complex-valued functions
Page 8
Complex-valued functions can be similarly integrated, by considering the real part and the imaginary part
separately.
If h=f+ig for real-valued integrable functions f, g, then the integral of h is defined by
 The function is Lebesgue integrable if and only if its absolute value is Lebesgue integrable (see Absolutely
integrable function).
Example
Consider the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function"] indicator function of the rational numbers, 1Q, also known as the Dirichlet function. This
function is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowhere_continuous"] nowhere continuous.
is not Riemann-integrable on [0, 1]: No matter how the set [0, 1] is partitioned into
subintervals, each partition contains at least one rational and at least one irrational number,
because rationals and irrationals are both dense in the reals. Thus the upper [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darboux_sum"] Darboux sums
are all one, and the lower Darboux sums are all zero.
is Lebesgue-integrable on [0, 1] using the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_measure"] Lebesgue measure: Indeed, it is the
indicator function of the rationals so by definition
because Q is countable.
Domain of integration
A technical issue in Lebesgue integration is that the domain of integration is defined as a set (a subset of a
measure space), with no notion of orientation. In elementary calculus, one defines integration with respect
to an orientation:
Generalizing this to higher dimensions yields integration of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form"] differential forms. By contrast, Lebesgue
integration provides an alternative generalization, integrating over subsets with respect to a measure; this
can be notated as
to indicate integration over a subset A. For details on the relation between these generalizations, see
 Differential form § Relation with measures.
Limitations of the Riemann integral
Page 9
With the advent of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series"] Fourier series, many analytical problems involving integrals came up whose satisfactory
solution required interchanging limit processes and integral signs. However, the conditions under which the
integrals
are equal proved quite elusive in the Riemann framework. There are some other technical difficulties with
the Riemann integral. These are linked with the limit-taking difficulty discussed above.
Failure of monotone convergence. As shown above, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indicator_function"] indicator function 1Q on the rationals is not
Riemann integrable. In particular, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_convergence_theorem"] Monotone convergence theorem fails. To see why, let {ak} be an
enumeration of all the rational numbers in [0, 1] (they are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable"] countable so this can be done.) Then let
The function gk is zero everywhere, except on a finite set of points. Hence its Riemann integral is zero.
Each gk is non-negative, and this sequence of functions is monotonically increasing, but its limit as k → ∞
is 1Q, which is not Riemann integrable.
Unsuitability for unbounded intervals. The Riemann integral can only integrate functions on a bounded
interval. It can however be extended to unbounded intervals by taking limits, so long as this doesn't yield an
answer such as ∞ − ∞.
Integrating on structures other than Euclidean space. The Riemann integral is inextricably linked to the
order structure of the real line.
Basic theorems of the Lebesgue integral
Two functions are said to be equal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_everywhere"] almost everywhere (
of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_set"] null set. 
for short) if  is a subset
Measurability of the set  is not required.
If f, g are non-negative measurable functions (possibly assuming the value +∞) such that
f = g almost everywhere, then
To wit, the integral respects the equivalence relation of almost-everywhere equality.
If f, g are functions such that f = g almost everywhere, then f is Lebesgue integrable if and
only if g is Lebesgue integrable, and the integrals of f and g are the same if they exist.
Linearity: If f and g are Lebesgue integrable functions and a and b are real numbers, then
af + bg is Lebesgue integrable and

Then, f is Lebesgue integrable and
Alternative formulations
It is possible to develop the integral with respect to the Lebesgue measure without relying on the full
machinery of measure theory. One such approach is provided by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniell_integral"] Daniell integral.
 There is also an alternative approach to developing the theory of integration via methods of functional
analysis. The Riemann integral exists for any continuous function f of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_space"] compact [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_(mathematics)"] support defined on Rn (or a
fixed open subset). Integrals of more general functions can be built starting from these integrals.
Let Cc be the space of all real-valued compactly supported continuous functions of R. Define a norm on
Cc by
Page 11
 Then Cc is a normed vector space (and in particular, it is a metric space.) All metric spaces have Hausdorff
completions, so let L1 be its completion. This space is isomorphic to the space of Lebesgue integrable
functions modulo the subspace of functions with integral zero. Furthermore, the Riemann integral ∫ is a
 uniformly continuous functional with respect to the norm on Cc, which is dense in L1. Hence ∫ has a
unique extension to all of L1. This integral is precisely the Lebesgue integral.
More generally, when the measure space on which the functions are defined is also a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact_space"] locally compact
 topological space (as is the case with the real numbers R), measures compatible with the topology in a
suitable sense ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon_measure"] Radon measures, of which the Lebesgue measure is an example) an integral with respect to
 them can be defined in the same manner, starting from the integrals of continuous functions with compact
support. More precisely, the compactly supported functions form a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space"] vector space that carries a natural
topology, and a (Radon) measure is defined as a continuous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map"] linear functional on this space. The value of a
measure at a compactly supported function is then also by definition the integral of the function. One then
proceeds to expand the measure (the integral) to more general functions by continuity, and defines the
measure of a set as the integral of its indicator function. This is the approach taken by Bourbaki (2004) and
a certain number of other authors. For details see [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon_measure#Radon_measures_on_locally_compact_spaces"] Radon measures.
Limitations of Lebesgue integral
The main purpose of the Lebesgue integral is to provide an integral notion where limits of integrals hold
under mild assumptions. There is no guarantee that every function is Lebesgue integrable. But it may
happen that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improper_integral"] improper integrals exist for functions that are not Lebesgue integrable. One example would be
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinc_function"] sinc function:
over the entire real line. This function is not Lebesgue integrable, as

Big Rudin. A complete and careful presentation of the theory. Good presentation of the Riesz
extension theorems. However, there is a minor flaw (in the first edition) in the proof of one of
the extension theorems, the discovery of which constitutes exercise 21 of Chapter 2.
