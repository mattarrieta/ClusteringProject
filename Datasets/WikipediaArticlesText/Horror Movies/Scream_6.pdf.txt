Development
Prior to the release of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_4"] Scream 4, series creator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Williamson_(screenwriter)"] Kevin Williamson claimed he had already "mapped out"
Scream 5 and Scream 6, but would wait to see the box office success of the fourth installment before
signing on for any more films.[10] In July 2014, Williamson revealed that Scream 4 was intended to kick off
a new trilogy of films, but the film "never took off in a way they hoped". Williamson also said that he
would likely not be involved in any further entries, as the series director [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Craven"] Wes Craven and his team were
"done" with him.[11] In Williamson's initial pitch, Scream 5 saw [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scream_(film_series)_characters#Jill_Roberts"] Jill Roberts being stalked by a killer at her
college campus, while Scream 6 would feature Gale Weathers as the main character and deal with her
relationship with Dewey Riley.[12]
In January 2022, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neve_Campbell"] Neve Campbell, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Arquette"] David Arquette, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Bettinelli-Olpin"] Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Gillett"] Tyler Gillett expressed
interest in making future films in the series.[13] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courteney_Cox"] Courteney Cox would later express an interest in a sequel
while doing publicity for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shining_Vale"] Shining Vale.[14] A sixth film was officially green-lit on February 3, 2022 by
 Spyglass Media Group. Olpin and Gillett of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Silence_(collective)"] Radio Silence would return to direct while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Vanderbilt"] James Vanderbilt
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Busick"] Guy Busick would write the script once again.[15] By the end of the month, Campbell was approached
to return for the film.[16] The following month, Cox had received the script and was courted to reprise her
role.[17] Also in March 2022, the sixth film's release date was set for March 31, 2023.[18] By May, plot
 details emerged, setting the film outside of Woodsboro.[19] Instead the film will take place in New York
City.[20] In June, Ortega said the film would feature a more "aggressive and violent" Ghostface than in
previous entries.[21]
Casting
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Ortega"] In May 2022, it was announced that Melissa Barrera, Jasmin Savoy Brown, Mason Gooding, and Jenna
Ortega would also return for the sixth film.[22] The following day, it was announced that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayden_Panettiere"] Hayden Panettiere
would reprise her role of Kirby Reed from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_4"] fourth film.[23] When asked about her involvement in the
 film, Cox claimed that her contract was not yet completed.[24] Also in June, it was announced that Dermot
Mulroney had joined the cast, playing a police officer,[8] and Cox officially confirmed her involvement
with the film.[25] On June 16, Jack Champion, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liana_Liberato"] Liana Liberato, Devyn Nekoda and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Segarra"] Josh Segarra joined the
cast.[26]
Campbell's involvement
Page 3
On June 6, 2022, it was announced Campbell would not be returning as Sidney Prescott for the sixth film.
 The actress made a statement about how her contract and salary negotiations had stalled with Paramount
Pictures:[5]
"As a woman I have had to work extremely hard in my career to establish my value, especially
when it comes to Scream. I felt the offer that was presented to me did not equate to the value I
have brought to the franchise. It's been a very difficult decision to move on. To all my Scream
fans, I love you. You've always been so incredibly supportive to me. I'm forever grateful to
you and to what this franchise has given me over the past 25 years."[27]
 IndieWire noted Campbell had spent 26 years acting in the franchise and announced it was "the end of an
era".[28] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Arquette"] David Arquette stated "I'd love for her to be a part of it. A Scream movie without Sidney is kind
of unfortunate, but I understand her decision. It's all a business in a way, they have to balance all these
elements to fit a budget and produce a film."[29] Jasmin Savoy Brown, as well as former Scream costars
 Emma Roberts, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Lillard"] Matthew Lillard and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Kennedy"] Jamie Kennedy, also expressed their support for Campbell's decision
and praised her contributions to the series.[30][31][32]
Filming
Filming began on June 9, 2022 in Montreal, Canada, with Vanderbilt, Paul Neinstein and William Sherak
 acting as producers under Project X Entertainment, while Chad Villella, Cathy Konrad, Marianne
Maddalena and Williamson will serve as executive producers.[33] Production was initially planned to begin
on June 6.[34][35]
