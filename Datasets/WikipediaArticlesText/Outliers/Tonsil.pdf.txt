Tonsil
The tonsils are a set of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphatic_system"] lymphoid organs facing into the
 aerodigestive tract, which is known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldeyer%27s_tonsillar_ring"] Waldeyer's tonsillar ring
and consists of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenoid"] adenoid tonsil, two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubal_tonsil"] tubal tonsils, two
 palatine tonsils, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingual_tonsil"] lingual tonsils. These organs play an
important role in the immune system.
When used unqualified, the term most commonly refers
specifically to the palatine tonsils, which are two lymphoid
organs situated at either side of the back of the human throat.
The palatine tonsils and the adenoid tonsil are organs consisting
of lymphoepithelial tissue located near the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oropharynx"] oropharynx and
 nasopharynx (parts of the throat).

Development
The palatine tonsils tend to reach their largest size in puberty, and they gradually undergo [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrophy"] atrophy
thereafter. However, they are largest relative to the diameter of the throat in young children. In adults, each
palatine tonsil normally measures up to 2.5 cm in length, 2.0 cm in width and 1.2 cm in thickness.[3]
The adenoid grows until the age of 5, starts to shrink at the age of 7 and becomes very small in
adulthood.[4]
Function
The tonsils are immunocompetent organs which serve as the immune system's first line of defense against
ingested or inhaled foreign pathogens, and as such frequently engorge with blood to assist in immune
responses to common illnesses such as the common cold. The tonsils have on their surface specialized
antigen capture cells called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfold_cell"] Microfold cell (M cells) that allow for the uptake of antigens produced by
pathogens. These M cells then alert the B cells and T cells in the tonsil that a pathogen is present and an
immune response is stimulated. [5] B cells are activated and proliferate in areas called germinal centers in
 the tonsil. These germinal centers are places where B memory cells are created and secretory antibody
(IgA) is produced.
A 2012 study provided evidence that the tonsils also produce T cells themselves, in a manner similar to the
way the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus"] thymus does.[6][7]
Clinical significance
The palatine tonsils can become enlarged (adenotonsillar hyperplasia) or inflamed (tonsillitis). The most
common way to treat tonsillitis is with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-inflammatory_drugs"] anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, or if bacterial in origin,
antibiotics, e.g. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amoxicillin"] amoxicillin and azithromycin. Surgical removal (tonsillectomy) may be advised if the tonsils
 obstruct the airway or interfere with swallowing, or in patients with severe or recurrent tonsillitis.[8][9]
However, different mechanisms of pathogenesis for these two subtypes of tonsillar hypertrophy have been
described,[10] and may have different responses to identical therapeutic efforts. In older patients,
asymmetric tonsils (also known as asymmetric tonsil hypertrophy) may be an indicator of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_infection"] virally infected
tonsils, or tumors such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma"] lymphoma or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squamous_cell_carcinoma"] squamous cell carcinoma.

A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonsillolith"] tonsillolith (also known as a “tonsil stone”) is material that
accumulates on the palatine tonsil. This can reach the size of a
 peppercorn and is white or cream in color. The main substance is
mostly calcium, but it has a strong unpleasant odor because of
 hydrogen sulfide and methyl [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercaptan"] mercaptan and other chemicals.

Palatine tonsil enlargement can affect speech, making it [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_voice"] hypernasal
and giving it the sound of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velopharyngeal_incompetence"] velopharyngeal incompetence (when
space in the mouth is not fully separated from the nose's air
space).[11] Tonsil size may have a more significant impact on upper
airway obstruction for obese children than for those of average
weight.[12]
As mucosal lymphatic tissue of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodigestive_tract"] aerodigestive tract, the palatine tonsils are viewed in some
 classifications as belonging to both the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and the mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue (MALT). Other viewpoints treat them (and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spleen"] spleen and thymus) as large lymphatic
organs contradistinguished from the smaller tissue loci of GALT and MALT.
