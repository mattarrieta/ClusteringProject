 Yale University is a private Ivy League research
university in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut"] New Haven, Connecticut. Founded in
 1701 as the Collegiate School,  it is the third-oldest
institution of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_in_the_United_States"] higher education in the United States and
among the most prestigious in the world.[7][8] 
Yale University
Chartered by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Colony"] Connecticut Colony, the Collegiate School
was established in 1701 by clergy to educate
 Congregational ministers before moving to New Haven
 in 1716. Originally restricted to theology and sacred
languages, the curriculum began to incorporate
 humanities and sciences by the time of the American
Revolution. In the 19th century, the college expanded
into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the
first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy"] PhD in the United States in 1861 and organizing as
a university in 1887. Yale's  faculty and student
populations grew after 1890 with rapid expansion of the
physical campus and scientific research.
Yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the
 original undergraduate college, the Yale Graduate
School of Arts and Sciences and twelve professional
 schools. While the university is governed by the Yale
Corporation, each school's  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_personnel"] faculty oversees its
curriculum and degree programs. In addition to a central
campus in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_New_Haven"] downtown New Haven, the university owns
athletic facilities in western New Haven, a campus in
 West Haven, and forests and nature preserves
 throughout New England. As of 2021, the university's
 endowment was valued at $42.3 billion, the second
 largest of any educational institution.[1] The Yale
University Library, serving all constituent schools, holds
more than 15 million volumes and is the third-largest
academic library in the United States.[9][10] Students

 As of October 2020, 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields
 Medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing

Early history of Yale College
Origins
Yale traces its beginnings to "An Act for Liberty to Erect a
Collegiate School", a would-be charter passed during a meeting in
New Haven by the General Court of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Colony"] Colony of Connecticut on
October 9, 1701. The Act was an effort to create an institution to
train ministers and lay leadership for Connecticut. Soon after, a
group of ten [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congregationalism_in_the_United_States"] Congregational ministers, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Andrew"] Samuel Andrew, Thomas
 Buckingham, Israel Chauncy, Samuel Mather (nephew of Increase
 Mather),  Rev. James Noyes II (son of James Noyes),  James
Pierpont, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Pierson"] Abraham Pierson, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noadiah_Russell_(Yale_founder)"] Noadiah Russell, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Webb"] Joseph Webb, and
 Timothy Woodbridge, all [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alumni"] alumni of Harvard, met in the study of
Reverend [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Russell_(Yale_co-founder)"] Samuel Russell, located in Branford, Connecticut, to
donate their books to form the school's library.[18] The group, led
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Pierpont_(Yale_founder)"] James Pierpont, is now known as "The Founders".[19]

School, which became [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_College"] Yale College,
October 9, 1701

College Chapel, printed by Daniel
Bowen in 1786 
From its origin it is known as the "Collegiate School",  the
institution opened in the home of its first rector, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Pierson"] Abraham Pierson,
who is today considered the first president of Yale. Pierson lived in
Killingworth (now Clinton). The school moved to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Saybrook,_Connecticut"] Saybrook and
then Wethersfield. In 1716, it moved to New Haven, Connecticut.
Meanwhile, there was a rift forming at Harvard between its sixth
president, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Increase_Mather"] Increase Mather, and the rest of the Harvard clergy,
whom Mather viewed as increasingly liberal, ecclesiastically lax,
and overly broad in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastical_polity"] Church polity. The feud caused the Mathers to
champion the success of the Collegiate School in the hope that it
would maintain the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puritan"] Puritan religious orthodoxy in a way that
 Harvard had not.[20] Rev. Jason Haven, the minister at the First
Church and Parish in Dedham, Massachusetts had been considered
for the presidency on account of his orthodox theology and for
"Neatness dignity and purity of Style [which] surpass those of all
that have been mentioned," but was passed over due to his "very
Valetudinary and infirm State of Health."[21]
Naming and development
In 1718, at the behest of either Rector [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Andrew"] Samuel Andrew or the
colony's Governor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurdon_Saltonstall"] Gurdon Saltonstall, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Mather"] Cotton Mather contacted the
successful Boston-born businessman [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elihu_Yale"] Elihu Yale to ask him for
financial help in constructing a new building for the college.
Through the persuasion of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Dummer"] Jeremiah Dummer, Yale, who had made
a fortune in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai"] Madras while working for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company"] East India Company as
the first president of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_St._George"] Fort St. George (largely through secret
contracts with Madras merchants that were illegal under Company
policy[22]), donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more
than £560, a substantial sum of money at the time. Cotton Mather
suggested that the school change its name to "Yale College."[23]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_(language)"] Welsh name Yale is the Anglicized spelling of the Iâl, which
the family estate at Plas yn Iâl, near the village of Llandegla, was
called.
Meanwhile, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard"] Harvard graduate working in England convinced
some 180 prominent intellectuals to donate books to Yale. The
1714 shipment of 500 books represented the best of modern
English literature, science, philosophy and theology at the time.[24] 
 Coat of arms of the family of Elihu
Yale, after whom the university was
named in 1718
It had a profound effect on intellectuals at Yale. Undergraduate
 Jonathan Edwards discovered John Locke's works and developed his original theology known as the "new
divinity." In 1722 the rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas,
announced that they had given up Calvinism, become Arminians, and joined the Church of England. They
 were ordained in England and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the Anglican faith. Thomas
Clapp became president in 1745 and while he attempted to return the college to Calvinist orthodoxy, he did
not close the library. Other students found Deist books in the library.[25]
Curriculum
Page 5
Yale College undergraduates follow a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_arts_education"] liberal arts curriculum with
departmental [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_(academic)"] majors and is organized into a social system of
 residential colleges.
Yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the
period—the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Awakening"] Great Awakening and the Enlightenment—due to the
religious and scientific interests of presidents [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Clap"] Thomas Clap and
 Ezra Stiles. They were both instrumental in developing the
scientific curriculum at Yale while dealing with wars, student
tumults, graffiti, "irrelevance" of curricula, desperate need for
 endowment and disagreements with the Connecticut
legislature.[26][27] 
Connecticut Hall, oldest building on
the Yale campus, built between 1750
and 1753
Serious American students of theology and divinity, particularly in
New England, regarded [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"] Hebrew as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_language"] classical language, along with
Greek and Latin, and essential for the study of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament"] Old Testament in
the original words. The Reverend [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Stiles"] Ezra Stiles, president of the
college from 1778 to 1795, brought with him his interest in the
Hebrew language as a vehicle for studying ancient [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible"] Biblical texts in
their original language (as was common in other schools), requiring
all freshmen to study Hebrew (in contrast to Harvard, where only
upperclassmen were required to study the language) and is
 responsible for the Hebrew phrase ‎ותמים ‎אורים (Urim and
Thummim) on the Yale seal. A 1746 graduate of Yale, Stiles came [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_College"] First diploma awarded by Yale
to the college with experience in education, having played an College, granted to Nathaniel
integral role in the founding of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University"] Brown University, in addition to  Chauncey in 1702
having been a minister.[28] Stiles' greatest challenge occurred in
July 1779 when British forces occupied New Haven and
threatened to raze the college. However, Yale graduate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Fanning_(colonial_administrator)"] Edmund Fanning, secretary to the British general in
command of the occupation, intervened and the college was saved. In 1803, Fanning was granted an
honorary degree [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL.D."] LL.D. for his efforts.[29]
Students
As the only college in Connecticut from 1701 to 1823, Yale educated the sons of the elite.[30] Punishable
offenses for students included cardplaying, tavern-going, destruction of college property, and acts of
disobedience to college authorities. During this period, Harvard was distinctive for the stability and maturity
of its tutor corps, while Yale had youth and zeal on its side.[31]
The emphasis on classics gave rise to a number of private student societies, open only by invitation, which
arose primarily as forums for discussions of modern scholarship, literature and politics. The first such
organizations were debating societies: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotonia_(literary_society)"] Crotonia in 1738, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linonia"] Linonia in 1753 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_in_Unity"] Brothers in Unity in 1768.
Linonia and Brothers in Unity continue to exist today with commemorations to them can be found with
names given to campus structures, like Brothers in Unity Courtyard in Branford College.
Eli Yale and the slave trade
 Early benefactor Elihu Yale's responsibilities as president of Fort St. George included overseeing its slave
trade, although he himself was never a slave trader or owner and imposed several restrictions on the trade
during his tenure.[32] Historians differ on whether or not he opposed slavery in general.[32][33] Notably,
Page 6
there are no accounts of Yale ever visiting or influencing the university; Yale College was named after him
only because of the size of his gift.[34]
In 2007, the Yale University Art Gallery removed a painting of Elihu Yale being attended to by a child
slave, with intentions of researching the identity of the child depicted.[35][32] The painting was redisplayed
in 2021.[36]
19th century
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Report_of_1828"] Yale Report of 1828 was a dogmatic defense of the Latin and
Greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in
 modern languages, mathematics, and science. Unlike higher
education in Europe, there was no [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_curriculum"] national curriculum for colleges
and universities in the United States. In the competition for students
and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with
demands for innovation. At the same time, they realized that a
significant portion of their students and prospective students Old Brick Row in 1807
demanded a classical background. The Yale report meant the
classics would not be abandoned. During this period, all institutions
experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track curriculum. In the
decentralized environment of higher education in the United States, balancing change with tradition was a
common challenge because it was difficult for an institution to be completely modern or completely
classical.[37][38] A group of professors at Yale and New Haven Congregationalist ministers articulated a
conservative response to the changes brought about by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_culture"] Victorian culture. They concentrated on
developing a person possessed of religious values strong enough to sufficiently resist temptations from
within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-ism"] 'isms' (professionalism, materialism, individualism, and
consumerism) tempting him from without.[39] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Graham_Sumner"] William Graham Sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909,
taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms of students.
Sumner bested President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Porter"] Noah Porter, who disliked the social sciences and wanted Yale to lock into its
traditions of classical education. Porter objected to Sumner's use of a textbook by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer"] Herbert Spencer that
espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.[40]
Until 1887, the legal name of the university was "The President and Fellows of Yale College, in New
Haven." In 1887, under an act passed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_General_Assembly"] Connecticut General Assembly, Yale was renamed to the
present "Yale University."[41]
Sports and debate
The Revolutionary War soldier [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Hale"] Nathan Hale (Yale 1773) was the archetype of the Yale ideal in the early
19th century: a manly yet aristocratic scholar, equally well-versed in knowledge and sports, and a patriot
who "regretted" that he "had but one life to lose" for his country. Western painter [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Remington"] Frederic Remington (Yale
1900) was an artist whose heroes gloried in the combat and tests of strength in the Wild West. The fictional,
turn-of-the-20th-century Yale man [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Merriwell"] Frank Merriwell embodied this same heroic ideal without racial
prejudice, and his fictional successor Frank Stover in the novel Stover at Yale (1911) questioned the
business mentality that had become prevalent at the school. Increasingly the students turned to athletic stars
as their heroes, especially since winning the big game became the goal of the student body, the alumni, and
the team itself.[42]
Page 7

 Regatta trophy, won in
 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 
Along with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard"] Harvard and Princeton, Yale students rejected British
concepts about [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateurism"] 'amateurism' in sports and constructed athletic programs
 that were uniquely American, such as football.[43] The Harvard–Yale
football rivalry began in 1875. Between 1892, when Harvard and Yale
met in one of the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercollegiate_debates"] intercollegiate debates,[44] and in 1909 (the year
of the first Triangular Debate of Harvard, Yale and Princeton) the
rhetoric, symbolism, and metaphors used in athletics were used to frame
 these early debates. Debates were covered on front pages of college
newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even
received the equivalent of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_letter"] athletic letters for their jackets. There were
also rallies to send off the debating teams to matches, but the debates
never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may
be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and
that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns
about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered
hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.[45]
In 1909–10, football faced a crisis resulting from the failure of the
previous reforms of 1905–06, which sought to solve the problem of serious injuries. There was a mood of
alarm and mistrust, and, while the crisis was developing, the presidents of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton
developed a project to reform the sport and forestall possible radical changes forced by government upon
the sport. Presidents [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Twining_Hadley"] Arthur Hadley of Yale, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._Lawrence_Lowell"] A. Lawrence Lowell of Harvard, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson"] Woodrow Wilson of
Princeton worked to develop moderate reforms to reduce injuries. Their attempts, however, were reduced
by rebellion against the rules committee and the formation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercollegiate_Athletic_Association"] Intercollegiate Athletic Association. While
the big three had attempted to operate independently of the majority, the changes pushed did reduce
injuries.[46]
Expansion
Starting with the addition of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_School_of_Medicine"] Yale School of Medicine in 1810, the college expanded gradually from
 then on, establishing the Yale Divinity School in 1822, Yale Law School in 1822, the Yale Graduate
 School of Arts and Sciences in 1847, the now-defunct Sheffield Scientific School in 1847,[47] and the Yale
School of Fine Arts in 1869. In 1887, under the presidency of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Dwight_V"] Timothy Dwight V, Yale College was
 renamed to Yale University, and the former name was subsequently applied only to the undergraduate
 college. The university would continue to expand greatly into the 20th and 21st century, adding the Yale
 School of Music in 1894, the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies in 1900, the Yale School of
 Public Health in 1915, the Yale School of Architecture in 1916, the Yale School of Nursing 1923, the Yale
School of Drama in 1955, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_School_of_Management"] Yale School of Management in 1976, and the Jackson School of Global
Affairs which is planned to open in 2022.[48] The Sheffield Scientific School would also reorganize its
relationship with the university to teach only undergraduate courses.
Expansion caused controversy about Yale's new roles. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Porter"] Noah Porter, a moral philosopher, was president
from 1871 to 1886. During an age of tremendous expansion in higher education, Porter resisted the rise of
the new research university, claiming that an eager embrace of its ideals would corrupt undergraduate
education. Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have
disparaged his leadership. Historian George Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary,
uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative.[49] Levesque continues,
saying he did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-
established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture. Levesque concludes, mention
how he may have misunderstood some of the challenges of his time, but he correctly anticipated the
enduring tensions that have accompanied the emergence and growth of the modern university.

20th century
Medicine
Milton Winternitz led the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_School_of_Medicine"] Yale School of Medicine as its dean
from 1920 to 1935. Dedicated to the new scientific medicine
established in Germany, he was equally fervent about "social
medicine" and the study of humans in their culture and
environment. He established the "Yale System" of teaching,
with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the
full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level
Yale School of Nursing and the psychiatry department and
built numerous new buildings. Progress toward his plans for
an Institute of Human Relations, envisioned as a refuge [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolsey_Hall"] Woolsey Hall c. 1905
where social scientists would collaborate with biological
scientists in a holistic study of humankind, unfortunately,
lasted for only a few years before the opposition of resentful anti-Semitic colleagues drove him to
resign.[50]
Faculty
Before [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"] World War II, most elite university faculties counted
among their numbers few, if any, Jews, blacks, women, or
other minorities; Yale was no exception. By 1980, this
condition had been altered dramatically, as numerous
members of those groups held faculty positions.[51] Almost
all members of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences—and some
members of other faculties—teach undergraduate courses,
more than 2,000 of which are offered annually.[52]

Women
In 1793, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucinda_Foote"] Lucinda Foote passed the entrance exams for Yale College, but was rejected by the president on
the basis of her gender.[53] Women studied at Yale University as early as 1892, in graduate-level programs
at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Graduate_School_of_Arts_and_Sciences"] Yale Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.[54]
In 1966, Yale began discussions with its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_school"] sister school [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassar_College"] Vassar College about merging to foster coeducation at
the undergraduate level. Vassar, then all-female and part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Sisters_(colleges)"] Seven Sisters—elite higher education
schools that historically served as sister institutions to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League"] Ivy League when most Ivy League institutions
still only admitted men—tentatively accepted, but then declined the invitation. Both schools introduced
coeducation independently in 1969.[55] Amy Solomon was the first woman to register as a Yale
undergraduate;[56] she was also the first woman at Yale to join an undergraduate society, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Anthony_Hall"] St. Anthony Hall.
The undergraduate class of 1973 was the first class to have women starting from freshman year;[57] at the
time, all undergraduate women were housed in Vanderbilt Hall at the south end of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Campus"] Old Campus.[58]
A decade into co-education, student assault and harassment by faculty became the impetus for the
trailblazing lawsuit [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_v._Yale"] Alexander v. Yale. In the late 1970s, a group of students and one faculty member sued
Yale for its failure to curtail campus sexual harassment by especially male faculty. The case was partly built
from a 1977 report authored by plaintiff [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Olivarius"] Ann Olivarius, now a feminist attorney known for fighting sexual
harassment, "A report to the Yale Corporation from the Yale Undergraduate Women's Caucus."[59] This
Page 9
case was the first to use [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX"] Title IX to argue and establish that the sexual harassment of female students can be
considered illegal sex discrimination. The plaintiffs in the case were Olivarius, Ronni Alexander (now a
 professor at Kobe University, Japan), Margery Reifler (works in the Los Angeles film industry), Pamela
Price (https://web.archive.org/web/20200527210701/https://www.pypesq.com/attorney/)  (civil rights
attorney in California), and Lisa E. Stone (works at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League"] Anti-Defamation League). They were joined by Yale
 classics professor John “Jack” J. Winkler, who died in 1990. The lawsuit, brought partly by Catharine
MacKinnon, alleged rape, fondling, and offers of higher grades for sex by several Yale faculty, including
 Keith Brion, professor of flute and director of bands, political Science professor Raymond Duvall (https://w
eb.archive.org/web/20200719013517/https://cla.umn.edu/about/directory/profile/rduvall) (now at the
 University of Minnesota), English professor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_George_Cooke"] Michael Cooke, and coach of the field hockey team, Richard
Kentwell. While unsuccessful in the courts, the legal reasoning behind the case changed the landscape of
sex discrimination law and resulted in the establishment of Yale's Grievance Board and the Yale Women's
Center.[60] In March 2011 a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_IX"] Title IX complaint was filed against Yale by students and recent graduates,
including editors of Yale's feminist magazine [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_Recognition"] Broad Recognition, alleging that the university had a hostile
sexual climate.[61] In response, the university formed a Title IX steering committee to address complaints of
sexual misconduct.[62] Afterwards, universities and colleges throughout the US also established sexual
harassment grievance procedures.
Class
Yale, like other Ivy League schools, instituted policies in the early 20th century designed to maintain the
proportion of white Protestants from notable families in the student body (see [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerus_clausus"] numerus clausus), and was
one of the last of the Ivies to eliminate such preferences, beginning with the class of 1970.[63]
21st century
In 2006, Yale and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peking_University"] Peking University (PKU) established a Joint Undergraduate Program in Beijing, an
exchange program allowing Yale students to spend a semester living and studying with PKU honor
students.[64] In July 2012, the Yale University-PKU Program ended due to weak participation.[64]
In 2007 outgoing Yale President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Levin"] Rick Levin characterized Yale's institutional priorities: "First, among the
nation's finest research universities, Yale is distinctively committed to excellence in undergraduate
education. Second, in our graduate and professional schools, as well as in Yale College, we are committed
to the education of leaders."[65]
In 2009, former [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom"] British Prime Minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair"] Tony Blair picked Yale as one location – the others being Britain's
 Durham University and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universiti_Teknologi_Mara"] Universiti Teknologi Mara – for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair_Faith_Foundation"] Tony Blair Faith Foundation's United States
Faith and Globalization Initiative.[66] As of 2009, former Mexican President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernesto_Zedillo"] Ernesto Zedillo is the director
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Center_for_the_Study_of_Globalization"] Yale Center for the Study of Globalization and teaches an undergraduate seminar, "Debating
Globalization".[67] As of 2009, former presidential candidate and DNC chair [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Dean"] Howard Dean teaches a
residential college seminar, "Understanding Politics and Politicians".[68] Also in 2009, an alliance was
formed among Yale, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London"] University College London, and both schools' affiliated hospital complexes to conduct
research focused on the direct improvement of patient care—a growing field known as translational
medicine. President Richard Levin noted that Yale has hundreds of other partnerships across the world, but
"no existing collaboration matches the scale of the new partnership with UCL".[69]
 In August 2013, a new partnership with the National University of Singapore led to the opening of Yale-
NUS College in Singapore, a joint effort to create a new liberal arts college in Asia featuring a curriculum
including both Western and Asian traditions.[70]

In 2017, having been suggested for decades,[71] Yale University renamed Calhoun College, named for
 slave owner, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abolitionist"] anti-abolitionist, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacist"] white supremacist Vice President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Calhoun"] John C. Calhoun (it is now Hopper
College, after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper"] Grace Hopper).[72][73]
In 2020, in the wake of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests"] protests around the world focused on racial relations and criminal justice reform,
the #CancelYale tag was used on social media to demand that Elihu Yale's name be removed from Yale
 University. Most support for the change stemmed from politically conservative pundits, such as Mike
Cernovich and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Coulter"] Ann Coulter, satirizing perceived excesses of online [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancel_culture"] cancel culture.[74] Yale was president
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company"] East India Company, a trading company that traded slaves as well as goods,[75]and his singularly
large donation[76][77] led to Yale relying on money from the slave-trade for its first scholarships and
endowments.[33][78]
In August 2020, the US [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice"] Justice Department sued Yale for alleged discrimination against Asian and white
candidates on the basis of their race through affirmative action admission policies.[79] In early February
2021, under the new Biden administration, the Justice Department withdrew the lawsuit. The group,
 Students for Fair Admissions, known for a similar [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_Fair_Admissions_v._President_and_Fellows_of_Harvard_College"] lawsuit against Harvard alleging the same issue, plans to
refile the lawsuit.[80]
Yale alumni in politics
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Globe"] Boston Globe wrote that "if there's one school that can lay claim to educating the nation's top national
leaders over the past three decades, it's Yale".[81] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_alumni"] Yale alumni were represented on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"] Democratic or
 Republican ticket in every U.S. presidential election between 1972 and 2004.[82] Yale-educated presidents
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush"] since the end of the Vietnam War include Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W.
Bush, and major-party nominees during this period include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton"] Hillary Clinton (2016), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry"] John Kerry (2004),
 Joseph Lieberman (vice president, 2000), and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargent_Shriver"] Sargent Shriver (vice president, 1972). Other Yale alumni
 who have made serious bids for the presidency during this period include Amy Klobuchar (2020), Tom
Steyer (2020), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Carson"] Ben Carson (2016), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Dean"] Howard Dean (2004), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Hart"] Gary Hart (1984 and 1988), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tsongas"] Paul Tsongas
(1992), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Robertson"] Pat Robertson (1988) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown"] Jerry Brown (1976, 1980, 1992).
Several explanations have been offered for Yale's representation in national elections since the end of the
Vietnam War. Various sources note the spirit of campus activism that has existed at Yale since the 1960s,
and the intellectual influence of Reverend [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sloane_Coffin"] William Sloane Coffin on many of the future candidates.[83] Yale
President Richard Levin attributes the run to Yale's focus on creating "a laboratory for future leaders," an
 institutional priority that began during the tenure of Yale Presidents Alfred Whitney Griswold and Kingman
Brewster.[83] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_H._Brodhead"] Richard H. Brodhead, former dean of Yale College and now president of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University"] Duke University,
stated: "We do give very significant attention to orientation to the community in our admissions, and there is
a very strong tradition of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteerism"] volunteerism at Yale."[81] Yale historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaddis_Smith"] Gaddis Smith notes "an ethos of
organized activity" at Yale during the 20th century that led John Kerry to lead the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Political_Union"] Yale Political Union's
 Liberal Party, George Pataki the Conservative Party, and Joseph Lieberman to manage the Yale Daily
News.[84] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Paglia"] Camille Paglia points to a history of networking and elitism: "It has to do with a web of
friendships and affiliations built up in school."[85] CNN suggests that George W. Bush benefited from
preferential admissions policies for the "son and grandson of alumni", and for a "member of a politically
influential family".[86] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times"] New York Times correspondent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisabeth_Bumiller"] Elisabeth Bumiller and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic_Monthly"] The Atlantic Monthly
correspondent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Fallows"] James Fallows credit the culture of community and cooperation that exists between students,
faculty, and administration, which downplays self-interest and reinforces commitment to others.[87]
During the 1988 presidential election, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush"] George H. W. Bush (Yale '48) derided [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dukakis"] Michael Dukakis for having
"foreign-policy views born in Harvard Yard's boutique". When challenged on the distinction between
Dukakis' Harvard connection and his own Yale background, he said that, unlike Harvard, Yale's reputation
was "so diffuse, there isn't a symbol, I don't think, in the Yale situation, any symbolism in it" and said Yale
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War"]
Page 11
did not share Harvard's reputation for "liberalism and elitism".[88] In 2004 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Dean"] Howard Dean stated, "In some
ways, I consider myself separate from the other three (Yale) candidates of 2004. Yale changed so much
between the class of '68 and the class of '71. My class was the first class to have women in it; it was the first
class to have a significant effort to recruit African Americans. It was an extraordinary time, and in that span
of time is the change of an entire generation".[87]
Administration and organization

laws. The corporation has 19 members: three [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_officio_member"] ex officio
members, ten successor trustees, and six elected alumni
fellows.[89] The university has three major academic
components: Yale College (the undergraduate program), the
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and the twelve
professional schools.[90]

Yale's former president [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_C._Levin"] Richard C. Levin was, at the time,
one of the highest paid university presidents in the United
States with a 2008 salary of $1.5 million.[91] Yale's
succeeding president Peter Salovey ranks 40th with a 2020
salary of $1.16 million.[92]
The Yale Provost's Office and similar executive positions
have launched several women into prominent university
executive positions. In 1977, Provost [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanna_Holborn_Gray"] Hanna Holborn Gray
was appointed interim president of Yale and later went on to

school, Catherine Gilliss, was appointed the dean of Duke University's School of Nursing and vice
chancellor for nursing affairs.[99] In 2007, Deputy Provost [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Kim_Bottomly"] H. Kim Bottomly was named president of
 Wellesley College.[100]
Similar examples for men who have served in Yale leadership positions can also be found. In 2004, Dean
of Yale College [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_H._Brodhead"] Richard H. Brodhead was appointed as the president of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University"] Duke University.[101] In 2008,
Provost [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_D._Hamilton"] Andrew Hamilton was confirmed to be the vice chancellor of the University of Oxford.[102]

Staff and labor unions
Yale University staff are represented by several different unions. Clerical and technical workers are
represented by Local 34, and service and maintenance workers are represented by Local 35, both of the
same union affiliate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNITE_HERE"] UNITE HERE.[103] Unlike similar institutions, Yale has consistently refused to
recognize its graduate student union, Local 33 (another affiliate of UNITE HERE), citing claims that the
union's elections were undemocratic and how graduate students are not employees;[104][105] the move to
not recognize the union has been criticized by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Federation_of_Teachers"] American Federation of Teachers.[106] In addition,
officers of the Yale University Police Department are represented by the Yale Police Benevolent
Association, which affiliated in 2005 with the Connecticut Organization for Public Safety
Employees.[103][107] Yale security officers joined the International Union of Security, Police and Fire
Professionals of America in late 2010,[108] even though the Yale administration contested the election.[109]
In October 2014, after deliberation,[110] Yale security decided to form a new union, the Yale University
Security Officers Association, which has since represented the campus security officers.[103][111]
Yale has a history of difficult and prolonged labor negotiations, often culminating in strikes.[112] There
have been at least eight strikes since 1968, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times"] The New York Times wrote that Yale has a reputation as
having the worst record of labor tension of any university in the U.S.[113] Moreover, Yale has been accused
by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL%E2%80%93CIO"] AFL–CIO of failing to treat workers with respect,[114] as well as not renewing contracts with
professors over involvement in campus labor issues.[115] Yale has responded to strikes with claims over
mediocre union participation and the benefits of their contracts.[116]
Campus 
Yale's  central campus in
 downtown New Haven
covers 260 acres (1.1 km2)
and comprises its main,
historic campus and a
medical campus adjacent to
 the Yale–New Haven
Hospital. In western New
 Yale Law School, located in the
Sterling Law Building 
Haven, the university holds
500 acres (2.0 km2)  of
athletic facilities, including
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Golf_Course"] Yale Golf Course.[117] In
2008, Yale purchased the 17-building, 136-acre (0.55 km2) former
 Bayer HealthCare complex in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Haven,_Connecticut"] West Haven, Connecticut,[118] the
buildings of which are now used as laboratory and research
space.[119] Yale also owns seven forests in Connecticut, Vermont,
and New Hampshire—the largest of which is the 7,840-acre
(31.7 km2) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale-Myers_Forest"] Yale-Myers Forest in Connecticut's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet_Corner"] Quiet Corner—and

 Interior of Beinecke Library
Yale is noted for its largely [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegiate_Gothic"] Collegiate Gothic campus[121] as well as several iconic modern buildings
commonly discussed in architectural history survey courses: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Kahn"] Louis Kahn's Yale Art Gallery[122] and Center
 for British Art, Eero Saarinen's Ingalls Rink and Ezra Stiles and Morse Colleges, and Paul Rudolph's Art &
Architecture Building. Yale also owns and has restored many noteworthy 19th-century mansions along
Page 13
 Hillhouse Avenue, which was considered the most beautiful street in America by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens"] Charles Dickens when he
visited the United States in the 1840s.[123] In 2011, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel%2BLeisure"] Travel+Leisure listed the Yale campus as one of the
most beautiful in the United States.[124]
Many of Yale's buildings were constructed in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegiate_Gothic"] Collegiate Gothic architecture style from 1917 to 1931,
financed largely by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_S._Harkness"] Edward S. Harkness, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Drama_School"] Yale Drama School.[125][126] Stone sculpture built
into the walls of the buildings portray contemporary college personalities, such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-
drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. Similarly, the decorative [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frieze"] friezes on the
buildings depict contemporary scenes, like a policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute (on the
 wall of the Law School), or a student relaxing with a mug of beer and a cigarette. The architect, James
Gamble Rogers, faux-aged these buildings by splashing the walls with acid,[127] deliberately breaking their
 leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages"] Middle Ages, and creating niches for
decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. In fact, the buildings
merely simulate Middle Ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in
the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. One exception is
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harkness_Tower"] Harkness Tower, 216 feet (66 m) tall, which was originally a free-standing stone structure. It was
reinforced in 1964 to allow the installation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Memorial_Carillon"] Yale Memorial Carillon
Statue of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Hale"] Nathan Hale in
front of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Hall"] Connecticut Hall

style are on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Campus"] Old Campus
 by architects like Henry
Austin, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_C._Haight"] Charles C. Haight
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Sturgis"] Russell Sturgis. Several
are associated with members
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_family"] Vanderbilt family,
including Vanderbilt
Hall,[128] Phelps Hall,[129]

and sciences school at Yale until 1956) and elements of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silliman_College"] Silliman College,
the largest residential college.[130]
The oldest building on campus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Hall"] Connecticut Hall (built in 1750), is in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_architecture"] Georgian style. Georgian-style
 buildings erected from 1929 to 1933 include Timothy Dwight College, Pierson College, and Davenport
College, except the latter's east, York Street façade, which was constructed in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture"] Gothic style to coordinate
with adjacent structures.
 The Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings &
Merrill, is one of the largest buildings in the world reserved exclusively for the preservation of rare books
and manuscripts. The library includes a six-story above-ground tower of book stacks, filled with 180,000
volumes, that is surrounded by large translucent Vermont marble panels and a steel and granite truss. The
panels act as windows and subdue direct sunlight while also diffusing the light in warm hues throughout
the interior.[131] Near the library is a sunken courtyard, with sculptures by Isamu Noguchi that are said to
represent time (the pyramid), the sun (the circle), and chance (the cube).[132] The library is located near the
 center of the university in Hewitt Quadrangle, which is now more commonly referred to as "Beinecke
Plaza."

 colleges Ezra Stiles and Morse.[134] These latter were modeled after the medieval Italian hill town of San
Gimignano – a prototype chosen for the town's pedestrian-friendly milieu and fortress-like stone
towers.[135] These tower forms at Yale act in counterpoint to the college's many Gothic spires and
Georgian cupolas.[136]

Sustainability
Yale's Office of Sustainability develops and implements sustainability practices at Yale.[137] Yale is
committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 10% below 1990 levels by 2020. As part of this
commitment, the university allocates renewable energy credits to offset some of the energy used by
residential colleges.[138] Eleven campus buildings are candidates for LEED design and certification.[139]
Yale Sustainable Food Project initiated the introduction of local, organic vegetables, fruits, and beef to all
residential college dining halls.[140] Yale was listed as a Campus Sustainability Leader on the Sustainable
Endowments Institute's College Sustainability Report Card 2008, and received a "B+" grade overall.[141]

Relationship with New Haven
Yale is the largest taxpayer and employer in the City of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven"] New Haven,[142] and has often buoyed the city's
economy and communities. Yale, however has consistently opposed paying a tax on its academic
property.[143] Yale's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University_Art_Gallery"] Art Galleries, along with many other university resources, are free and openly
accessible. Yale also funds the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut#New_Haven_Promise"] New Haven Promise program, paying full tuition for eligible students from
New Haven public schools.[144]
Town–gown relations
Yale has a complicated relationship with its home city; for example, thousands of students volunteer every
year in a myriad of community organizations, but city officials, who decry Yale's exemption from local
property taxes, have long pressed the university to do more to help. Under President Levin, Yale has
 financially supported many of New Haven's efforts to reinvigorate the city. Evidence suggests that the town
and gown relationships are mutually beneficial. Still, the economic power of the university increased
dramatically with its financial success amid a decline in the local economy.[145]
Campus safety
Several campus safety strategies have been pioneered at Yale. The first campus police force was founded at
Yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus.[146][147]
Later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and
city residents and curb destructive student behavior.[148][149] In addition to the Yale Police Department, a
variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_escort"] safety escort, and 24-hour shuttle service.
In the 1970s and 1980s, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_locations_by_per_capita_income"] poverty and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_crime"] violent crime rose in New Haven, dampening Yale's student and
faculty recruiting efforts.[150] Between 1990 and 2006, New Haven's crime rate fell by half, helped by a
 community policing strategy by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven_Police_Department"] New Haven Police and Yale's campus became the safest among the Ivy
League and other peer schools.[151]
Page 16
In 2004, the national non-profit watchdog group Security on Campus filed a complaint with the
 U.S. Department of Education, accusing Yale of under-reporting rape and sexual assaults.[152][153]
In April 2021, Yale announced that it will require students to receive a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine"] COVID-19 vaccine as a condition
of being on campus during the fall 2021 term.[154]
Academics
Admissions
Undergraduate admission to Yale College is considered "most
selective" by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._News_%26_World_Report"] U.S. News.[157][158] In 2022, Yale accepted 2,234
students to the Class of 2026 out of 50,015 applicants, for an
acceptance rate of 4.46%.[159] 98% of students graduate within six
years.[160]
Through its program of need-based financial aid, Yale commits to
meet the full demonstrated financial need of all applicants. Most
financial aid is in the form of grants and scholarships that do not
need to be paid back to the university, and the average need-based
aid grant for the Class of 2017 was $46,395.[161] 15% of Yale
College students are expected to have no parental contribution, and
about 50% receive some form of financial aid.[160][162][163] About
16% of the Class of 2013 had some form of student loan debt at
graduation, with an average debt of $13,000 among
borrowers.[160] For 2019, Yale ranked second in enrollment of
recipients of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Merit_Scholarship_Program"] National Merit $2,500 Scholarship (140
scholars).[164]

Collections
 Yale University Library, which holds over 15 million volumes, is the third-largest university collection in
the United States.[9][165] The main library, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Memorial_Library"] Sterling Memorial Library, contains about 4 million volumes,
and other holdings are dispersed at subject libraries.
Rare books are found in several Yale collections. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beinecke_Rare_Book_Library"] Beinecke Rare Book Library has a large collection of
rare books and manuscripts. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Cushing/John_Hay_Whitney_Medical_Library"] Harvey Cushing/John Hay Whitney Medical Library includes important
historical medical texts, including an impressive collection of rare books, as well as historical medical
instruments. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Walpole_Library"] Lewis Walpole Library contains the largest collection of 18th‑century British literary
works. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_Club"] Elizabethan Club, technically a private organization, makes its Elizabethan folios and first

The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peabody_Museum_of_Natural_History"] Peabody Museum of Natural History in New Haven is
used by school children and contains research collections in
anthropology, archaeology, and the natural environment. The
 Yale University Collection of Musical Instruments, affiliated
with the Yale School of Music, is perhaps the least-known of
Yale's collections because its hours of opening are restricted.

 Since the late 1960s, Yale produces social sciences and policy research through its Institution for Social and
Policy Studies (ISPS).
In addition to eminent faculty members, Yale research relies heavily on the presence of roughly 1200
 Postdocs from various national and international origin working in the multiple laboratories in the sciences,
social sciences, humanities, and professional schools of the university. The university progressively
 recognized this working force with the recent creation of the Office for Postdoctoral Affairs and the Yale
Postdoctoral Association.

Campus life
Yale is a research university, with the majority
of its students in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_school"] graduate and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_school"] professional
schools. Undergraduates, or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_College"] Yale College
students, come from a variety of ethnic,
national, socioeconomic, and personal
backgrounds. Of the 2010–2011 freshman
class, 10% are non‑U.S. citizens, while 54%
went to public high schools.[186] The median
family income of Yale students is $192,600,
with 57% of students coming from the top
10% highest-earning families and 16% from
the bottom 60%.[187]

Yale's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residential_college"] residential college system was established in 1933 by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_S._Harkness"] Edward S. Harkness, who admired the social
intimacy of Oxford and Cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegiate_university"] colleges at Yale and
Harvard. Though Yale's colleges resemble their English precursors organizationally and architecturally,
they are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegiate_university#Dependent_colleges"] dependent entities of Yale College and have limited autonomy. The colleges are led by a head and
an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates constitute each college's
fellowship. Colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as
"Master's Teas," but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. All other undergraduate
courses are taught by the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and are open to members of any college.
All undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85
percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory.[188] While the majority of
upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Campus"] Old Campus, the university's
oldest precinct.
While Harkness' original colleges were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgian_architecture"] Georgian Revival or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collegiate_Gothic"] Collegiate Gothic in style, two colleges
constructed in the 1960s, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_College"] Morse and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Stiles_College"] Ezra Stiles Colleges, have modernist designs. All twelve college
quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common
room, and a range of student facilities. The twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant
places in university history. In 2017, the university opened two new colleges near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Hill_(Yale_University)"] Science Hill.[189]

Calhoun College
Since the 1960s, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Calhoun"] John C. Calhoun's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"] white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership[190][191][192][193]
 had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to Calhoun. The racially motivated church
shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calhoun_College"] Calhoun College,
one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. In July 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name
change.[191] They argued in the petition that—while Calhoun was respected in the 19th century as an
"extraordinary American statesman"—he was "one of the most prolific defenders of slavery and white
supremacy" in the history of the United States.[191][192] In August 2015 Yale President Peter Salovey
addressed the Freshman Class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the
college would not be renamed.[193] He described Calhoun as "a notable political theorist, a vice president
to two different U.S. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator
representing South Carolina".[193] He acknowledged that Calhoun also "believed that the highest forms of
civilization depend on involuntary servitude. Not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to
be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best
interests."[190] Student activism about this issue increased in the fall of 2015, and included further protests
sparked by controversy surrounding an administrator's comments on the potential positive and negative
implications of students who wear [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_costumes"] Halloween costumes that are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culturally_sensitive"] culturally sensitive.[194] Campus-wide
discussions expanded to include critical discussion of the experiences of women of color on campus, and
the realities of racism in undergraduate life.[195] The protests were sensationalized by the media and led to
the labelling of some students as being members of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Snowflake"] Generation Snowflake.[196]
In April 2016 Salovey announced that "despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests,"
Calhoun's name will remain on the Yale residential college[197] explaining that it is preferable for Yale
students to live in Calhoun's "shadow" so they will be "better prepared to rise to the challenges of the
present and the future". He claimed that if they removed Calhoun's name, it would "obscure" his "legacy of
slavery rather than addressing it".[197] "Yale is part of that history" and "We cannot erase American history,
but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it." One change that will be issued is the title of "master" for
faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to "head of college" due to its
connotation of slavery.[198]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pauli_Murray_College_Yale.jpg"]
Page 22
Despite this apparently conclusive reasoning, Salovey announced that Calhoun College would be renamed
for groundbreaking computer scientist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Murray_Hopper"] Grace Murray Hopper in February 2017.[199] This renaming
decision received a range of responses from Yale students and alumni.[200][201][202]
Student organizations
In 2014, Yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the
process of registration.[203]
 The university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. Established in 1872, The
Yale Record is the world's oldest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humor_magazine"] humor magazine. Newspapers include the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Daily_News"] Yale Daily News, which was
first published in 1878, and the weekly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Herald"] Yale Herald, which was first published in 1986. The Yale Journal

the Yale Drama Coalition[204] serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various Sudler
Fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. WYBC Yale Radio[205] is the campus's
radio station, owned and operated by students. While students used to broadcast on AM and FM
frequencies, they now have an Internet-only stream.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_College_Council"] Yale College Council (YCC) serves as the campus's undergraduate student government. All registered
student organizations are regulated and funded by a subsidiary organization of the YCC, known as the
Undergraduate Organizations Funding Committee (UOFC).[206] The Graduate and Professional Student
Senate (GPSS) serves as Yale's graduate and professional student government.
 The Yale Political Union is advised by alumni political leaders such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry"] John Kerry and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pataki"] George Pataki. The

Traditions
Page 23
 Yale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their "bright college
years," though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with "bubble pipes".[208][209] ("Bright
College Years," the university's alma mater, was penned in 1881 by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Strong_Durand"] Henry Durand, Class of 1881, to the
tune of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Wacht_am_Rhein"] Die Wacht am Rhein.) Yale's student tour guides tell visitors that students consider it good luck to
rub the toe of the statue of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Dwight_Woolsey"] Theodore Dwight Woolsey on Old Campus; however, actual students rarely do
so.[210] In the second half of the 20th century Bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large
inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. In spite
of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014.[211][212][213]

won [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympics"] Olympic Games [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Medal"] Gold Medal for men's eights in 1924 and
1956. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Corinthian_Yacht_Club"] Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, founded in 1881, is the
oldest collegiate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing_(sport)"] sailing club in the world.
 In 1896, Yale and Johns Hopkins played the first known ice
hockey game in the United States. Since 2006, the school's ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative
game.[218]
Yale students claim to have invented Frisbee, by tossing empty [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisbie_Pie_Company"] Frisbie Pie Company tins.[219][220]
Page 24
Yale athletics are supported by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Precision_Marching_Band"] Yale Precision Marching Band. "Precision" is used here ironically; the
band is a scatter-style band that runs wildly between formations rather than actually marching.[221] The
band attends every home football game and many away, as well as most hockey and basketball games
throughout the winter.
Yale intramural sports are also a significant aspect of student life. Students compete for their respective
residential colleges, fostering a friendly rivalry. The year is divided into fall, winter, and spring seasons,
each of which includes about ten different sports. About half the sports are coeducational. At the end of the
year, the residential college with the most points (not all sports count equally) wins the Tyng Cup.
Song
Notable among the songs commonly played and sung at events such as commencement, convocation,
alumni gatherings, and athletic games are the alma mater, "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_College_Years"] Bright College Years". Despite its popularity,
"[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boola_Boola"] Boola Boola" is not the official fight song, albeit being the origin of the university's unofficial motto. The
official Yale [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_song"] fight song, "Bulldog" was written by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Porter"] Cole Porter during his undergraduate days and is sung
after touchdowns during a football game.[222] Additionally, two other songs, "Down the Field" by C.W.
O'Conner, and "Bingo Eli Yale", also by Cole Porter, are still sung at football games. According to College
Fight Songs: An Annotated Anthology published in 1998, "Down the Field" ranks as the fourth-greatest
fight song of all time.[223]
Mascot
The school [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mascot"] mascot is "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handsome_Dan"] Handsome Dan", the Yale bulldog, and the Yale [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_song"] fight song contains the refrain,
"Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow." The school color, since 1894, is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Blue"] Yale Blue.[224] Yale's Handsome
Dan is believed to be the first college mascot in America, having been established in 1889.[225]
