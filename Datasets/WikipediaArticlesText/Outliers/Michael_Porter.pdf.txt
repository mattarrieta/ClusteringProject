Porter said in an interview that he first became interested in competition through sports. He was on the
NCAA championship golf squad at Princeton and also played football, baseball and basketball growing
up.[3]
Porter credits Harvard professor Roland "Chris" Christensen with inspiring him and encouraging him to
speak up during class, hand-writing Porter a note that began: "Mr. Porter, you have a lot to contribute in
class and I hope you will." Porter reached the top of the class by the second year at Harvard Business
School.[3]
At Harvard, Porter took classes in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_organization"] industrial organization economics, which attempts to model the effect of
competitive forces on industries and their profitability. This study inspired the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_five_forces_analysis"] Porter five forces analysis
framework for analyzing industries.[3]
Career
Michael Porter is the author of 20 books and numerous articles including Competitive Strategy, Competitive
Advantage, Competitive Advantage of Nations, and On Competition. A six-time winner of the McKinsey
Award for the best [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Business_Review"] Harvard Business Review article of the year, Professor Porter is the most cited author in
business and economics.[4]
Porter stated in a 2010 interview: "What I've come to see as probably my greatest gift is the ability to take
an extraordinarily complex, integrated, multidimensional problem and get arms around it conceptually in a
way that helps, that informs and empowers practitioners to actually do things."[3]
Competition among nations
Porter wrote "The Competitive Advantage of Nations" in 1990. The book is based on studies of ten nations
and argues that a key to national wealth and advantage was the productivity of firms and workers
collectively, and that the national and regional environment supports that productivity. He proposed the
"diamond" framework, a mutually-reinforcing system of four factors that determine national advantage:
factor conditions; demand conditions; related or supporting industries; and firm strategy, structure and
rivalry. Information, incentives, and infrastructure were also key to that productivity.[5]
During April 2014, Porter discussed how the United States ranks relative to other countries on a
comprehensive scorecard called "The Social Progress Index", an effort which he co-authored.[6] This
scorecard rated the U.S. on a comprehensive set of metrics; overall, the U.S. placed 16th.[7]
Healthcare
Porter has devoted considerable attention to understanding and addressing the pressing problems in health
care delivery in the United States and other countries. His book, Redefining Health Care (written with
Elizabeth Teisberg), develops a new strategic framework for transforming the value delivered by the health
care system, with implications for providers, health plans, employers, and government, among other actors.
The book received the James A. Hamilton award of the American College of Healthcare Executives in
2007 for book of the year. His [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Journal_of_Medicine"] New England Journal of Medicine research article, "A Strategy for Health
Care Reform – Toward a Value-Based System" (July 2009), lays out a health reform strategy for the U.S.
His work on health care is being extended to address the problems of health care delivery in developing
 countries, in collaboration with Dr. Jim Yong Kim, Sachin H. Jain, and others at the Harvard Medical
School and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_School_of_Public_Health"] Harvard School of Public Health.

Consulting
In addition to his research, writing, and teaching, Porter serves as an advisor to business, government, and
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_sector"] social sector. He has served as strategy advisor to numerous leading U.S. and international companies,
 including Caterpillar, Procter & Gamble,[8] Scotts Miracle-Gro, Royal Dutch Shell, and Taiwan
 Semiconductor. Professor Porter once served on two public boards of directors, those of Thermo Fisher
Scientific and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_Technology_Corporation"] Parametric Technology Corporation. He also plays an active role in U.S. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy"] economic policy,
working with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Branch_of_the_United_States"] Executive Branch and with Congress, and has led national economic-strategy programs
in numerous countries. As of 2009 he was working with the presidents of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda"] Rwanda and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"] South Korea.
In 1983 Michael Porter co-founded the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_Group"] Monitor Group, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_consulting"] strategy-consulting firm. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte"] Deloitte Consulting
acquired the Monitor Group in 2013 through a structured [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_proceeding"] bankruptcy proceeding.[9]
Non-profit
Michael Porter has founded four major non-profit organizations: Initiative for a Competitive Inner City –
ICIC, founded in 1994,[10] and which he still chairs,[11] which addresses economic development in
distressed urban communities; the Center for Effective Philanthropy, which creates rigorous tools for
measuring foundation effectiveness; FSG Social Impact Advisors, a leading non-profit strategy firm which
he co-founded with Mark Kramer,[12] serving NGOs, corporations, and foundations in the area of creating
social value; and International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurements (ICHOM), which he co-
founded in 2012 with Stefan Larsson and Martin Ingvar. ICHOM supports the key strategic agenda items
in Porter's Value-Based Health Care Delivery framework by working with patients and leading healthcare
providers to create a global standard for measuring health outcomes.[13] He also currently serves on the
Board of Trustees of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University"] Princeton University.
Honors and awards
In 2000, Michael Porter was appointed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lawrence_(bishop)"] Bishop William Lawrence [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University_Professor"] University Professor at Harvard, the
university's highest recognition awarded to Harvard faculty.[14]
Criticisms
Porter has been criticized by some academics for inconsistent logical argument in his assertions.[15] Critics
have also labeled Porter's conclusions as lacking in empirical support and as justified with selective case
studies. They have also claimed that Porter fails to credit original creators of his postulates originating from
pure microeconomic theory.[4][16][17][18] Others have argued Porter's firm-level analysis is widely
misunderstood and mis-taught.[19]
