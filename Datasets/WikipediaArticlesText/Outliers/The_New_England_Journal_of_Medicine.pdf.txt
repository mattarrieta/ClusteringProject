History
In September 1811, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Collins_Warren"] John Collins Warren, a Boston physician,[3]
along with James Jackson, submitted a formal prospectus to
establish the New England Journal of Medicine and Surgery and
Collateral Branches of Science as a medical and philosophical
journal.[4] Subsequently, the first issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine and Surgery and the Collateral Branches of
Medical Science was published in January 1812.[5] The journal
was published quarterly.[6]
In 1823, another publication, the Boston Medical Intelligencer,
appeared under the editorship of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_V._C._Smith"] Jerome V. C. Smith.[7]
The editors of the New England Journal of Medicine and Surgery
and the Collateral Branches of Medical Science purchased the
weekly Intelligencer for $600 in 1828,[8] merging the two

Notable articles
Notable articles from the course of The New England Journal of Medicine's history include:
In November 1846, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Jacob_Bigelow"] Henry Jacob Bigelow, a Boston surgeon, reported a breakthrough in the
search for surgical [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anesthetics"] anesthetics with the first uses of inhaled ether in 1846. This allowed
patients to remain sedated during operations ranging from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_extraction"] dental extraction to
amputation.[13] "A patient has been rendered completely insensible during an amputation of
the thigh, regain consciousness after a short interval," Bigelow wrote. "Other severe
operations have been performed without the knowledge of the patients."
In June 1906, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Homer_Wright"] James Homer Wright published an article that described how he stained and
studied [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_marrow"] bone marrow with descriptions of what are now known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megakaryocytes"] megakaryocytes and
platelets.[14]
In October 1872, a lecture by C. E. Brown-Séquard was published that proposed the then-
revolutionary idea that one [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere"] cerebral hemisphere can influence both sides of the body. The
 neurologist would go on to describe what is now known as the Brown-Séquard
syndrome.[15]
In June 1948, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Farber"] Sidney Farber reported promising results in treatment of early childhood
leukemia. Based on anecdotal evidence that children with acute leukemia worsened if they
were given [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folic_acid"] folic acid, he worked on blocking folic acid metabolism. His team gave 16 infants
and children with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_lymphoblastic_leukemia"] acute lymphoblastic leukemia a folic acid inhibitor, aminopterin—10
showed improvement by clinical and hematologic parameters after three months.[16] In his
Page 4
article, Farber advised receiving the results cautiously: "It is again emphasized that these
remissions are temporary in character and that the substance is toxic and may be productive
of even greater disturbances than have been encountered so far in our studies," he wrote.
"No evidence has been mentioned in this report that would justify the suggestion of the term
'cure' of acute leukemia in children."
In November 1952, cardiologist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Zoll"] Paul Zoll published an early report on resuscitation of the
heart. "The purpose of this report is to describe the successful use in 2 patients of a quick,
simple, effective and safe method of arousing the heart from ventricular standstill by an
artificial, external, electric pacemaker," he wrote. "For the first time it was possible to keep a
patient alive during [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventricular_asystole"] ventricular asystole lasting for hours to days. This procedure may prove
valuable in many clinical situations."[17]
In February 1973, NEJM published the first report of polyp removal using a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonoscope"] colonoscope and
introduced a procedure during screening to reduce cancer risk. The authors reported on 218
patients, from whom they removed 303 polyps (at one or more procedures per patient).[18]
 A letter published in the NEJM in 1980 was later described by the journal as having been
"heavily and uncritically cited"[19] to claim that addiction due to use of opioids was rare, and
its publication in such an authoritative journal was used by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry"] pharmaceutical companies to
push widespread use of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid"] opioid drugs, leading to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic_in_the_United_States"] an addiction crisis in the U.S. and other
countries.[20]
In December 1981, two landmark articles[21][22] described the clinical course of four patients
—first reported in the CDC's June 1981 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report—with the
disease that would come to be known as AIDS.
In April 2001, Druker et al. reported a targeted therapy for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_myelogenous_leukemia"] chronic myelogenous leukemia.
Based on the knowledge that BCR-ABL, a constitutively activated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrosine_kinase"] tyrosine kinase, causes
CML, the authors tested with success an inhibitor of this tyrosine kinase in patients who had
failed first-line therapy. The finding helped begin the era of designing cancer drugs to target
specific molecular abnormalities.[23]
In October 2020, the journal published an editorial, signed by all 34 editors, in which they
condemned the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_administration"] Trump administration's handling of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic"] COVID-19 pandemic saying that
"they are dangerously incompetent" and that "they have taken a crisis and turned it into a
tragedy." This is the first time NEJM has ever supported or condemned a political candidate
and only three other times in history has an editorial been signed by all the editors.[24]
In April 2021, Carhart-Harris et al. demonstrated that in the pharmacological treatment of
 major depressive disorder, there was no significant difference in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant"] antidepressant effects
between the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_drug"] psychedelic drug [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin"] psilocybin and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor"] SSRI [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escitalopram"] escitalopram after six weeks.[25]
Significant doses of psilocybin were only administered twice in the six-week period, while
escitalopram was taken daily. This was the first time psychedelics and SSRIs were
compared in the treatment of depression.[26][27][28]
Social media
On April 25, 1996, the NEJM announced a new web site, which published each week the abstracts for
research articles and the full text of editorials, cases, and letters to the editor. After print publishing for 184
years this was the NEJM's first use of the Internet for electronic publication.[29]
The site was launched several months earlier in 1996, but the editors wanted proof that weekly electronic
publication would work. Only then was an announcement approved for publication on the editorial page.
In 1997, the website included prepublication releases of certain articles prior to their print publication.[30] In
1998, online publication extended to include the full text of all its articles from 1993 forward.[31]
Since its launch, NEJM has added to its site:[32]
Page 5
Videos in Clinical Medicine, peer-reviewed educational videos to teach procedures
requiring skilled techniques and specialized physical examination.[33]
Interactive Medical Cases, which mimic a clinical encounter by presenting the patient's
history with results of the physical examination and laboratory and radiographic tests.
Multiple-choice questions throughout test the taker's knowledge.[34]
NEJM Archive, the entire collection of the journal's published material.[32]
Influence
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Polk_Awards"] George Polk Awards site noted that its 1977 award to The New England Journal of Medicine:
"...provided the first significant mainstream visibility for a publication that would achieve enormous
attention and prestige in the ensuing decades."[35]
The journal usually has the highest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor"] impact factor of the journals of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_medicine"] internal medicine. According to the
 Journal Citation Reports, NEJM had a 2017 impact factor of 79.258,[36] ranking it first of 153 journals in
the category "General & Internal Medicine".[37] It was the only journal in the category with an impact
factor of more than 70. By comparison, the second and third ranked journals in the category ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lancet"] The Lancet
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA_(journal)"] JAMA) had impact factors of 53.254 and 47.661 respectively.[38]
 Theodore Dalrymple feels that this influence is unwarranted. In False Positive: A Year of Error, Omission,
and Political Correctness in the New England Journal of Medicine, he examines various articles on
medical and social issues that the NEJM published over the course of a year. He found that many arrived at
conclusions which were not supported by the evidence presented, or ignored easily available evidence that
contradicted their conclusions.[39]
Specialty journals
In 2022, NEJM set up a new sub-journal, NEJM Evidence. NEJM Evidence is a monthly digital journal
featuring original research. It focuses on clinical trials and decision making.
Ingelfinger rule  NEJM Evidence
The New England Journal of Medicine requires that articles it
publishes have not been published or released elsewhere. Referred
to as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingelfinger_rule"] Ingelfinger rule, the policy is intended to protect
newsworthiness, and to subject research to peer review "before it
is touted to the public or the profession".[40] By 1991, four types
of exceptions were recognized, including when "prepublication
release of research conclusions is warranted because of immediate
implications for the public health".[41]
The rule was first described in a 1969 editorial, "Definition of Sole
Contribution",  by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Ingelfinger"] Franz Ingelfinger, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor-in-chief"] editor-in-chief at that
time.[40][42] A number of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_journals"] medical journals have similar rules in
place.[43][44]

drug Vioxx. A study was published in the journal in November

those taking Vioxx.[45] According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Smith_(editor)"] Richard Smith, the former
editor of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMJ"] British Medical Journal,  concerns about the
 correctness of that study were raised with the journal's editor, Jeff 
 Journal homepage (https://evide
nce.nejm.org/)
 Drazen, as early as August 2001. That year, both the US Food and
Drug Administration and the Journal of the American Medical Association also cast doubt on the validity
of the data interpretation that had been published in the NEJM.[46] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_%26_Co."] Merck withdrew the drug from market
in September 2004. In December 2005, NEJM published an expression of concern about the original study
following discovery that the authors knew more about certain adverse events than they disclosed at the time
of publication. From the Expression of Concern: "Until the end of November 2005, we believed that these
were late events that were not known to the authors in time to be included in the article published in the
Journal on November 23, 2000. It now appears, however, from a memorandum dated July 5, 2000, that
was obtained by subpoena in the Vioxx litigation and made available to the Journal, that at least two of the
authors knew about the three additional myocardial infarctions at least two weeks before the authors
submitted the first of two revisions and 4 1/2 months before publication of the article."[47] During the five-
year period between publication and Expression of Concern, it has been estimated that Merck paid NEJM
as much as US$836,000 for article reprints that Merck used for promotional purposes.[48] The journal was
publicly rebuked for its response to the research issues in editorials appearing in publications including the
British Medical Journal[46] and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journal_of_the_Royal_Society_of_Medicine"] Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine.[49]
Open access policy
NEJM provides delayed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-access_journals#Medicine"] free online access to its research articles (it does so six months after publication,
 and maintains that access dating back to 1990).[50] This delay does not apply to readers from the least
developed countries, for whom the content is available at no charge for personal use.[51]
NEJM also has two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast"] podcast features, one with interviews of doctors and researchers that are publishing in
the journal, and another summarizing the content of each issue. Other offerings include Continuing Medical
Education, Videos in Clinical Medicine (showing videos of medical procedures), and the weekly Image
Challenge.
