Connecticut Colony
The Connecticut Colony or Colony of Connecticut,
originally known as the Connecticut River Colony or
 simply the River Colony, was an English colony in New
England which later became Connecticut. It was
organized on March 3, 1636 as a settlement for a Puritan
congregation, and the English permanently gained control
of the region in 1637 after struggles with the Dutch. The
colony was later the scene of a bloody war between the
colonists and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pequot_people"] Pequot Indians known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pequot_War"] Pequot War.
Connecticut Colony played a significant role in the
establishment of self-government in the New World with
 its refusal to surrender local authority to the Dominion of
New England, an event known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_Oak"] Charter Oak
incident which occurred at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Adams"] Jeremy Adams' inn and tavern.
Two other English settlements in the State of Connecticut
 were merged into the Colony of Connecticut: Saybrook
Colony in 1644 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven_Colony"] New Haven Colony in 1662.

In the colony's early years, the governor could not serve consecutive terms, so the governorship rotated for
20 years between John Haynes and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hopkins"] Edward Hopkins, both of whom were from Hartford. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wyllys"] George Wyllys,
 Thomas Welles, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Webster_(governor)"] John Webster, also Hartford men, sat in the governor's chair for brief periods in the
1640s and 1650s.
 John Winthrop the Younger of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_London,_Connecticut"] New London was the son of the founder of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony"] Massachusetts Bay Colony,
and he played an important role in consolidating separate settlements into a single colony on the
Connecticut River. He also served as Governor of Connecticut from 1659 to 1675, and he was instrumental
 in obtaining the colony's 1662 charter which incorporated New Haven into Connecticut. His son Fitz-John
Winthrop also governed the colony for 10 years starting in 1698.
Major [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mason_(c._1600%E2%80%931672)"] John Mason was the military leader of the early colony. He was the commander in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pequot_War"] Pequot War, a
magistrate, and the founder of Windsor, Saybrook, and Norwich. He was also Deputy Governor under
Winthrop. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ludlow"] Roger Ludlow was an Oxford-educated lawyer and former Deputy Governor of the
Massachusetts Bay Colony. He petitioned the General Court for rights to settle the area, and he led the
March Commission in settling disputes over land rights. He is credited as drafting the Fundamental Orders
of Connecticut (1650) in collaboration with Hooker, Winthrop, and others. He was also the first Deputy
Governor of Connecticut.
 William Leete of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilford,_Connecticut"] Guilford served as governor of New Haven Colony before its merger into Connecticut,
and he also served as governor of Connecticut following Winthrop's death in 1675. He is the only man to
serve as governor of both New Haven and Connecticut. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Treat"] Robert Treat of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milford,_Connecticut"] Milford served as governor of the
colony, both before and after its inclusion in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_New_England"] Dominion of New England under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Edmund_Andros"] Sir Edmund Andros. His
father [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Treat"] Richard Treat was one of the original patentees of the colony. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Wolcott_(Connecticut_politician)"] Roger Wolcott was a weaver,
statesman, and politician from Windsor, and he served as governor from 1751 to 1754. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Wolcott"] Oliver Wolcott was
a signer of the Declaration of Independence and also of the Articles of Confederation, as a representative of
Connecticut and the nineteenth governor. He was a major general for the Connecticut Militia in the
Revolutionary War serving under George Washington.
Religion
The original colonies along the Connecticut River and in New Haven were established by separatist
 Puritans who were connected with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Bay_Colony"] Massachusetts and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Colony"] Plymouth colonies. They held [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinist"] Calvinist religious
beliefs similar to the English Puritans, but they maintained that their congregations needed to be separated
from the English state church. They had immigrated to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England"] New England during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Puritan_migration_to_New_Amsterdam_(1620%E2%80%9340)&action=edit&redlink=1"] Great Migration. In the
middle of the 18th century, the government restricted voting rights with a property qualification and a
church membership requirement.[1] Congregationalism was the established church in the colony by the time
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"] American Civil War.[2]
