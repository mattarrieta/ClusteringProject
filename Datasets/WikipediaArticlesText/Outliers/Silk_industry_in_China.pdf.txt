Silk industry in China
China is the world's largest and earliest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk"] silk producer. The vast
majority of Chinese silk originates from the mulberry silkworms
([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombyx_mori"] Bombyx mori). During the larval stage of its life-cycle, the insects
feed on the leaves of mulberry trees. Non-mulberry silkworms
cocoon production in China primarily focuses on wild silk from the
Chinese Tussah moth (Antheraea spp.). This moth typically feeds
on trees (e.g. oaks) and its larvae spin coarser, flatter, yellower
filament than the mulberry silk moths.[1]
In 2005, China accounted for 74 percent of the global raw silk
production and 90 percent of the world export market.[2]

Industrial plans
Local governments have and are continuing to introduce new
facilities that are expected to bring in latest high-end silk
 manufacturing machinery that will elevate both the quality and the
quantity of the silk being produced in China. It is estimated that it
will render significant revenue increases as its new facilities bring
increased production and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_(business)"] distribution capabilities.
There are a number of material preferential benefits. These
 government incentives include such as land policy exemptions, tax
breaks, project prioritization (priority in review and approval of
applications), and Energy discounts (upon approval, company can
receive discounts of fees related to water, electric, gas, etc.).

Geography
Different from the East coast of China, the silk industry has more emphasis on silk reprocessing, Western
parts is more focused on raw silk production due to its natural [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather"] weather and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil"] soil conditions, mostly in
 Chongqing and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan"] Yunnan areas. Also as the land cost and manpower cost is increasing on the east coast,
business is shifting to the west. With the government's preferential policies, Chongqing's silk industry has
seen some significant developments.

Foreign investment
Foreign investment has helped develop the silk industry. Foreign
investment has optimized the structure of local silk companies, and
brought in new technology.
