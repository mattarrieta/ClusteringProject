Venus
Venus is the second [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet"] planet from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"] Sun and is named after
 the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the brightest
natural object in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"] Earth's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_sky"] night sky after the Moon, Venus can
cast shadows and can be visible to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_eye"] naked eye in broad
daylight.[18][19] Venus's orbit is smaller than [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit"] that of Earth, but
 its maximal elongation is 47°; thus, at latitudes with a day-
night cycle, it is most readily visible for up to a few hours
following the start of sunset or before sunrise. At times, it has
been seen in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_night"] completely dark sky. Venus orbits the Sun
every 224.7 Earth days.[20] It has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synodic_day"] synodic day length of 117
Earth days and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_period"] sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days.
Consequently, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any
 other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite
direction to all but Uranus. This means that the Sun rises from
its western horizon and sets in its east.[21] Venus does not
have any moons, a distinction it shares only with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)"] Mercury
among the planets in the Solar System.[22]
The third smallest planet in the Solar System, Venus is a
 terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet"
because of their similar size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and
bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other
respects. It has the densest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere"] atmosphere of the four terrestrial
planets, consisting of more than 96% [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"] carbon dioxide. The
 atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times
the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the pressure at
900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though Mercury
is closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any
planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K
(464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of
highly reflective clouds of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid"] sulfuric acid, preventing its surface
from being seen from Earth in light. It may have had water
oceans in the past,[23][24] but after these evaporated the
temperature rose under a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaway_greenhouse_effect"] runaway greenhouse effect.[25] The
water has probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen
has been [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_escape"] swept into interplanetary space by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"] solar wind
because of the lack of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere"] planetary magnetic field.[26] Because
of the lethal surface conditions, the planet is sometimes
referred to as Earth's "evil twin".[27]
As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a
major fixture in human culture for as long as records have
existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many cultures and
has been a prime inspiration for writers and poets as the

"morning star" and "evening star". Venus was the first planet
to have its motions plotted across the sky, as early as the
second millennium BCE.[28]
Its proximity to Earth has made Venus a prime target for early
interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth
visited by a spacecraft ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_1"] Venera 1 in 1961) and the first to be
successfully landed on (by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_7"] Venera 7 in 1970). The planet's
thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible in the
visible spectrum, and the first detailed maps did not emerge
until the arrival of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellan_(spacecraft)"] Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have
been proposed for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rover_(space_exploration)"] rovers or more complex missions, but they
are hindered by Venus's hostile surface conditions. The
possibility of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Venus"] life on Venus has long been a topic of
speculation; in recent years, the topic has received active
research.

Physical characteristics
Size comparison of Venus and Earth
Venus is one of the four [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_planet"] terrestrial planets in the Solar System,
meaning that it is a rocky body like Earth. It is similar to Earth
in size and mass and is often described as Earth's "sister" or
"twin".[29] The diameter of Venus is 12,103.6 km
(7,520.8 mi)—only 638.4 km (396.7 mi) less than Earth's—
and its mass is 81.5% of Earth's. Conditions on the Venusian
surface differ radically from those on Earth because its dense
 atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide, with most of the
remaining 3.5% being nitrogen.[30] The surface pressure is
9.3 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)"] megapascals (93 bars),  and the average surface
 temperature is 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F), above the critical
points of both major constituents and making the surface
atmosphere a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_fluid"] supercritical fluid.
Atmosphere and climate
Venus has an extremely dense [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere"] atmosphere composed of
96.5% [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"] carbon dioxide, 3.5% nitrogen—both exist as
supercritical fluids at the planet's surface—and traces of other
gases including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide"] sulfur dioxide.[31] The mass of its atmosphere
is 92 times that of Earth's, whereas the pressure at its surface
is about 93 times that at Earth's—a pressure equivalent to that
at a depth of nearly 1 km (5⁄8 mi) under Earth's oceans. The
density at the surface is 65 kg/m3 (4.1 lb/cu ft), 6.5% that of
water or 50 times as dense as Earth's atmosphere at 293 K
(20 °C; 68 °F) at sea level. The CO2-rich atmosphere
generates the strongest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect"] greenhouse effect in the Solar System,
creating surface temperatures of at least 735 K (462 °C;
864 °F).[20][32] This makes the Venusian surface hotter than
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)"] Mercury's, which has a minimum surface temperature of 53 K
(−220 °C; −364 °F) and maximum surface temperature of
700 K (427 °C; 801 °F),[33][34] even though Venus is nearly
 twice Mercury's distance from the Sun and thus receives only

or accretion of a more massive
Minimum 820 °F (438 °C) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_atmosphere"] primary atmosphere from solar

to explain the enrichment.
However, the atmosphere is also depleted of radiogenic argon, a proxy
to mantle degassing, suggesting an early shutdown of major
magmatism.[40][41] 
In visible light, Venus is a nearly
featureless and colourless sphere
with a uniform cloud cover
Studies have suggested that billions of years ago, Venus's atmosphere
could have been much more like the one surrounding the early Earth,
and that there may have been substantial quantities of liquid water on
the surface. After a period of 600 million to several billion years,[42]
 solar forcing from rising luminosity of the Sun caused the evaporation
of the original water. A runaway greenhouse effect was created once a
critical level of greenhouse gases (including water) was added to its
atmosphere.[43] Although the surface conditions on Venus are no
longer hospitable to any Earth-like life that may have formed before
this event, there is speculation on the possibility that life exists in the
upper cloud layers of Venus, 50 km (30 mi) up from the surface,
where the temperature ranges between 303 and 353 K (30 and 80 °C;
86 and 176 °F) but the environment is acidic.[44][45][46] The putative 
Cloud structure of the Venusian
atmosphere in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"] ultraviolet band
detection of an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_line"] absorption line of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphine"] phosphine in Venus's atmosphere,
with no known pathway for abiotic production, led to speculation in
September 2020 that there could be extant life currently present in the atmosphere.[47][48] Later research
attributed the spectroscopic signal that was interpreted as phosphine to sulfur dioxide,[49] or found that in
fact there was no absorption line.[50][51]
 Thermal inertia and the transfer of heat by winds in the lower atmosphere mean that the temperature of
Venus's surface does not vary significantly between the planet's two hemispheres, those facing and not
facing the Sun, despite Venus's extremely slow rotation. Winds at the surface are slow, moving at a few
kilometres per hour, but because of the high density of the atmosphere at the surface, they exert a significant
amount of force against obstructions, and transport dust and small stones across the surface. This alone
would make it difficult for a human to walk through, even without the heat, pressure, and lack of
oxygen.[52]
 Above the dense CO2 
layer are thick clouds, consisting mainly of sulfuric acid, which is formed by sulfur
dioxide and water through a chemical reaction resulting in sulfuric acid hydrate. Additionally, the
atmosphere consists of approximately 1% [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferric_chloride"] ferric chloride.[53][54] Other possible constituents of the cloud
particles are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferric_sulfate"] ferric sulfate, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_chloride"] aluminium chloride and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoric_anhydride"] phosphoric anhydride. Clouds at different levels have
Page 5
different compositions and particle size distributions.[53] These clouds reflect and scatter about 90% of the
sunlight that falls on them back into space, and prevent visual observation of Venus's surface. The
permanent cloud cover means that although Venus is closer than Earth to the Sun, it receives less sunlight
on the ground. Strong 300 km/h (185 mph) winds at the cloud tops go around Venus about every four to
five Earth days.[55] Winds on Venus move at up to 60 times the speed of its rotation, whereas Earth's fastest
winds are only 10–20% rotation speed.[56]
The surface of Venus is effectively isothermal; it retains a constant temperature not only between the two
hemispheres but between the equator and the poles.[5][57] Venus's minute [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt"] axial tilt—less than 3°, compared
to 23° on Earth—also minimises seasonal temperature variation.[58] Altitude is one of the few factors that
affect Venusian temperature. The highest point on Venus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Montes"] Maxwell Montes, is therefore the coolest point on
Venus, with a temperature of about 655 K (380 °C; 715 °F) and an atmospheric pressure of about 4.5 MPa
(45 bar).[59][60] In 1995, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellan_(spacecraft)"] Magellan spacecraft imaged a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_snow"] highly reflective substance at the tops of the
highest mountain peaks that bore a strong resemblance to terrestrial snow. This substance likely formed
from a similar process to snow, albeit at a far higher temperature. Too volatile to condense on the surface, it
rose in gaseous form to higher elevations, where it is cooler and could precipitate. The identity of this
substance is not known with certainty, but speculation has ranged from elemental [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tellurium"] tellurium to lead sulfide
(galena).[61]
Although Venus has no seasons as such, in 2019, astronomers identified a cyclical variation in sunlight
absorption by the atmosphere, possibly caused by opaque, absorbing particles suspended in the upper
clouds. The variation causes observed changes in the speed of Venus's zonal winds and appears to rise and
fall in time with the Sun's 11-year [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunspot_cycle"] sunspot cycle.[62]
The existence of lightning in the atmosphere of Venus has been controversial[63] since the first suspected
bursts were detected by the Soviet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera"] Venera probes.[64][65][66] In 2006–07, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Express"] Venus Express clearly detected
 whistler mode waves, the signatures of lightning. Their [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/intermittent"] intermittent appearance indicates a pattern
associated with weather activity. According to these measurements, the lightning rate is at least half of that
on Earth,[67] however other instruments have not detected lightning at all.[63] The origin of any lightning
remains unclear, but could originate from the clouds or volcanoes.
In 2007, Venus Express discovered that a huge double [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_vortex"] atmospheric vortex exists at the south pole.[68][69]
Venus Express also discovered, in 2011, that an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone"] ozone layer exists high in the atmosphere of Venus.[70] On
29 January 2013, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESA"] ESA scientists reported that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere"] ionosphere of Venus streams outwards in a manner
similar to "the ion tail seen streaming from a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet"] comet under similar conditions."[71][72]
In December 2015, and to a lesser extent in April and May 2016, researchers working on Japan's Akatsuki
mission observed bow shapes in the atmosphere of Venus. This was considered direct evidence of the
existence of perhaps the largest stationary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_wave"] gravity waves in the solar system.[73][74][75]

Geography
 The Venusian surface was a subject of speculation until some of its secrets were revealed by planetary
science in the 20th century. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera"] Venera landers in 1975 and 1982 returned images of a surface covered in
sediment and relatively angular rocks.[78] The surface was mapped in detail by Magellan in 1990–91. The
ground shows evidence of extensive volcanism, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur"] sulfur in the atmosphere may indicate that there
have been recent eruptions.[79][80]
About 80% of the Venusian surface is covered by smooth, volcanic plains, consisting of 70% plains with
wrinkle ridges and 10% smooth or lobate plains.[81] Two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland_continent"] highland "continents" make up the rest of its
surface area, one lying in the planet's northern hemisphere and the other just south of the equator. The
northern continent is called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishtar_Terra"] Ishtar Terra after Ishtar, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon"] Babylonian goddess of love, and is about the size of
Australia. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Montes"] Maxwell Montes, the highest mountain on Venus, lies on Ishtar Terra. Its peak is 11 km (7 mi)
above the Venusian average surface elevation.[82] The southern continent is called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphrodite_Terra"] Aphrodite Terra, after
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology"] Greek goddess of love, and is the larger of the two highland regions at roughly the size of South
America. A network of fractures and faults covers much of this area.[83]
The absence of evidence of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava"] lava flow accompanying any of the visible [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldera"] calderas remains an enigma. The
planet has few [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_crater"] impact craters, demonstrating that the surface is relatively young, at 300–600 million years
old.[84][85] Venus has some unique surface features in addition to the impact craters, mountains, and valleys
commonly found on rocky planets. Among these are flat-topped volcanic features called "farra", which
look somewhat like pancakes and range in size from 20 to 50 km (12 to 31 mi) across, and from 100 to
1,000 m (330 to 3,280 ft) high; radial, star-like fracture systems called "novae"; features with both radial
and concentric fractures resembling spider webs, known as "arachnoids"; and "coronae", circular rings of
fractures sometimes surrounded by a depression. These features are volcanic in origin.[86]
Page 7
Most [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_geological_features_on_Venus"] Venusian surface features are named after historical and mythological women.[87] Exceptions are
Maxwell Montes, named after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Clerk_Maxwell"] James Clerk Maxwell, and highland regions [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Regio"] Alpha Regio, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Regio"] Beta Regio, and
 Ovda Regio. The last three features were named before the current system was adopted by the International
Astronomical Union, the body which oversees [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_nomenclature"] planetary nomenclature.[88]
The longitude of physical features on Venus are expressed relative to its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_meridian"] prime meridian. The original prime
meridian passed through the radar-bright spot at the centre of the oval feature Eve, located south of Alpha
Regio.[89] After the Venera missions were completed, the prime meridian was redefined to pass through the
central peak in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne_(crater)"] crater Ariadne on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedna_Planitia"] Sedna Planitia.[90][91]
The stratigraphically oldest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessera_(Venus)"] tessera terrains have consistently lower thermal emissivity than the surrounding
basaltic plains measured by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_Express"] Venus Express and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellan_(spacecraft)"] Magellan, indicating a different, possibly a more felsic,
mineral assemblage.[23][92] The mechanism to generate a large amount of felsic crust usually requires the
presence of water ocean and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"] plate tectonics, implying that habitable condition had existed on early Venus.
However, the nature of tessera terrains is far from certain.[93]
Volcanism
Much of the Venusian surface appears to have been shaped by
volcanic activity. Venus has several times as many volcanoes as Earth,
and it has 167 large volcanoes that are over 100 km (60 mi) across.
The only volcanic complex of this size on Earth is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_(island)"] Big Island of
Hawaii.[86]: 154  This is not because Venus is more volcanically active
than Earth, but because its crust is older and is not subject to the same
 erosion process. Earth's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust"] oceanic crust is continually recycled by
 subduction at the boundaries of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectonic_plate"] tectonic plates, and has an average age
of about a hundred million years,[94] whereas the Venusian surface is
estimated to be 300–600 million years old.[84][86] 
 False-colour radar map of Maat
Mons
Several lines of evidence point to ongoing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano"] volcanic activity on Venus.
 Sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere dropped by a factor of 10 between 1978 and 1986, jumped
in 2006, and again declined 10-fold.[95] This may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large
volcanic eruptions.[96][97] It has also been suggested that Venusian lightning (discussed below) could
originate from volcanic activity (i.e. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_lightning"] volcanic lightning). In January 2020, astronomers reported evidence
that suggests that Venus is currently volcanically active, specifically the detection of olivine, a volcanic
product that would weather quickly on the planet's surface.[98][99]
In 2008 and 2009, the first direct evidence for ongoing volcanism was observed by Venus Express, in the
form of four transient localized infrared hot spots within the rift zone [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganiki_Chasma"] Ganis Chasma,[100][n 1] near the
shield volcano [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maat_Mons"] Maat Mons. Three of the spots were observed in more than one successive orbit. These
spots are thought to represent lava freshly released by volcanic eruptions.[101][102] The actual temperatures
are not known, because the size of the hot spots could not be measured, but are likely to have been in the
800–1,100 K (527–827 °C; 980–1,520 °F) range, relative to a normal temperature of 740 K (467 °C;
872 °F).[103]
Craters
Almost a thousand impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface. On other cratered
bodies, such as Earth and the Moon, craters show a range of states of degradation. On the Moon,
degradation is caused by subsequent impacts, whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion. On
Venus, about 85% of the craters are in pristine condition. The number of craters, together with their well-
Page 8
preserved condition, indicates the planet underwent a global
resurfacing event 300–600 million years ago,[84][85] followed by a
decay in volcanism.[104] Whereas Earth's crust is in continuous
motion, Venus is thought to be unable to sustain such a process.
Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle, Venus instead
undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until
they reach a critical level that weakens the crust. Then, over a period
of about 100 million years, subduction occurs on an enormous scale,
completely recycling the crust.[86] 
 Impact craters on the surface of
Venusian craters range from 3 to 280 km (2 to 174 mi) in diameter. No Venus (false-colour image
craters are smaller than 3 km, because of the effects of the dense reconstructed from radar data)
atmosphere on incoming objects. Objects with less than a certain
 kinetic energy are slowed so much by the atmosphere that they do not
create an impact crater.[105] Incoming projectiles less than 50 m (160 ft) in diameter will fragment and burn
up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground.[106]
Internal structure
Without [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_seismology"] seismic data or knowledge of its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia"] moment of inertia, little
direct information is available about the internal structure and
 geochemistry of Venus.[107] The similarity in size and density
between Venus and Earth suggests they share a similar internal
structure: a core, mantle, and crust. Like that of Earth, the Venusian
core is most likely at least partially liquid because the two planets
have been cooling at about the same rate,[108] although a
completely solid core cannot be ruled out.[109] The slightly smaller
size of Venus means pressures are 24% lower in its deep interior The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_differentiation"] differentiated structure of Venus
than Earth's.[110] The predicted values for the moment of inertia
based on planetary models suggest a core radius of 2,900–
3,450 km.[109] This is in line with the first observation-based estimate of 3,500 km.[111]
The principal difference between the two planets is the lack of evidence for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"] plate tectonics on Venus,
possibly because its crust is too strong to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction"] subduct without water to make it less viscous. This results in
reduced heat loss from the planet, preventing it from cooling and providing a likely explanation for its lack
of an internally generated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field"] magnetic field.[112]Instead, Venus may lose its internal heat in periodic major
resurfacing events.[84]
Magnetic field and core
In 1967, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_4"] Venera 4 found Venus's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field"] magnetic field to be much weaker than that of Earth. This magnetic field
is induced by an interaction between the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere"] ionosphere and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"] solar wind,[113][114] rather than by an internal
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory"] dynamo as in the Earth's core. Venus's small [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere_of_Venus"] induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the
atmosphere against [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_radiation"] cosmic radiation.
The lack of an intrinsic magnetic field at Venus was surprising, given that it is similar to Earth in size and
was expected also to contain a dynamo at its core. A dynamo requires three things: a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor"] conducting liquid,
rotation, and convection. The core is thought to be electrically conductive and, although its rotation is often
thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo.[115][116] This implies that the
dynamo is missing because of a lack of convection in Venus's core. On Earth, convection occurs in the
Page 9
liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much higher in temperature than the
 top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat
flux through the crust. This [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_insulation"] insulating effect would cause the mantle temperature to increase, thereby
reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic
field. Instead, the heat from the core is reheating the crust.[117]
One possibility is that Venus has no solid inner core,[118] or that its core is not cooling, so that the entire
liquid part of the core is at approximately the same temperature. Another possibility is that its core has
already completely solidified. The state of the core is highly dependent on the concentration of sulfur,
which is unknown at present.[117]
The weak magnetosphere around Venus means that the solar wind is interacting directly with its outer
atmosphere. Here, ions of hydrogen and oxygen are being created by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociation_(chemistry)"] dissociation of water molecules
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"] ultraviolet radiation. The solar wind then supplies energy that gives some of these ions sufficient
velocity to escape Venus's gravity field. This erosion process results in a steady loss of low-mass hydrogen,
helium, and oxygen ions, whereas higher-mass molecules, such as carbon dioxide, are more likely to be
retained. Atmospheric erosion by the solar wind could have led to the loss of most of Venus's water during
the first billion years after it formed.[119] However, the planet may have retained a dynamo for its first 2–3
billion years, so the water loss may have occurred more recently.[120] The erosion has increased the ratio of
higher-mass [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium"] deuterium to lower-mass hydrogen in the atmosphere 100 times compared to the rest of the
solar system.[121]
Orbit and rotation
Venus orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 0.72 AU
(108 million km; 67 million mi), and completes an orbit every
224.7 days. Although all [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_orbit"] planetary orbits are elliptical, Venus's orbit
is currently the closest to circular, with an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eccentricity_(orbit)"] eccentricity of less than
0.01.[5] Simulations of the early solar system orbital dynamics have
shown that the eccentricity of the Venus orbit may have been
substantially larger in the past, reaching values as high as 0.31 and
possibly impacting the early climate evolution.[122] The current
near-circular orbit of Venus means that when Venus lies between
Earth and the Sun in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astronomy)#Superior_and_inferior"] inferior conjunction, it makes the closest
approach to Earth of any planet at an average distance of
41 million km (25 million mi).[5][n 2][123]The planet reaches
inferior conjunction every 584 days, on average.[5] Because of the
 decreasing eccentricity of Earth's orbit, the minimum distances will
become greater over tens of thousands of years. From the year 1 to
5383, there are 526 approaches less than 40 million km
(25 million mi); then, there are none for about 60,158 years.[124] 
Venus is the second planet from the
Sun, orbiting approximately 1.6 times
(yellow trail) in Earth's 365 days (blue
trail).
All the planets in the Solar System orbit the Sun in an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticlockwise"] anticlockwise direction as viewed from above Earth's
north pole. Most planets also rotate on their axes in an anti-clockwise direction, but Venus rotates clockwise
in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_and_prograde_motion"] retrograde rotation once every 243 Earth days—the slowest rotation of any planet. Because its rotation is
so slow, Venus is very close to spherical.[125] A Venusian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_day"] sidereal day thus lasts longer than a Venusian
year (243 versus 224.7 Earth days). Venus's equator rotates at 6.52 km/h (4.05 mph), whereas Earth's
rotates at 1,674.4 km/h (1,040.4 mph).[129][130] Venus's rotation period measured with Magellan spacecraft
data over a 500-day period is smaller than the rotation period measured during the 16-year period between
the Magellan spacecraft and Venus Express visits, with a difference of about 6.5 minutes.[131] Because of
the retrograde rotation, the length of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_day"] solar day on Venus is significantly shorter than the sidereal day, at
Page 10
116.75 Earth days (making the Venusian solar day shorter than [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)"] Mercury's 176 Earth days — the 116-day
figure is extremely close to the average number of days it takes Mercury to slip underneath the Earth in its
orbit).[11] One Venusian year is about 1.92 Venusian solar days.[132] To an observer on the surface of
Venus, the Sun would rise in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poles_of_astronomical_bodies"] the west and set in the east,[132] although Venus's opaque clouds prevent
observing the Sun from the planet's surface.[133]
Venus may have formed from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_nebula"] solar nebula with a different rotation period and obliquity, reaching its
current state because of chaotic spin changes caused by planetary perturbations and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide"] tidal effects on its dense
atmosphere, a change that would have occurred over the course of billions of years. The rotation period of
Venus may represent an equilibrium state between tidal locking to the Sun's gravitation, which tends to
slow rotation, and an atmospheric tide created by solar heating of the thick Venusian atmosphere.[134][135]
The 584-day average interval between successive close approaches to Earth is almost exactly equal to
5 Venusian solar days (5.001444 to be precise),[136] but the hypothesis of a spin-orbit resonance with Earth
has been discounted.[137]
Venus has no natural satellites.[138] It has several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_asteroid"] trojan asteroids: the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-satellite"] quasi-satellite [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_VE68"] 2002 VE68[
139][140]
and two other temporary trojans, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(322756)_2001_CK32"] 2001 CK32 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_XE133"] 2012 XE133
.[141] In the 17th century, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini"] Giovanni Cassini
reported a moon orbiting Venus, which was named [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neith_(hypothetical_moon)"] Neith and numerous sightings were reported over the
 following 200 years, but most were determined to be stars in the vicinity. Alex Alemi's and David
Stevenson's 2006 study of models of the early Solar System at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Institute_of_Technology"] California Institute of Technology shows
Venus likely had at least one moon created by a huge [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event"] impact event billions of years ago.[142] About
10 million years later, according to the study, another impact reversed the planet's spin direction and caused
the Venusian moon gradually to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_deceleration"] spiral inward until it collided with Venus.[143] If later impacts created
moons, these were removed in the same way. An alternative explanation for the lack of satellites is the
effect of strong solar tides, which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets.[138]
Observability
To the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_eye"] naked eye, Venus appears as a white point of light brighter
than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun).[144] The planet's
mean [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"] apparent magnitude is −4.14 with a standard deviation of
0.31.[16] The brightest magnitude occurs during crescent phase
about one month before or after inferior conjunction. Venus fades
to about magnitude −3 when it is backlit by the Sun.[145] The
planet is bright enough to be seen in broad daylight,[146] but is
more easily visible when the Sun is low on the horizon or setting.
As an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_planet"] inferior planet, it always lies within about 47° of the
Sun.[147] 
Venus, pictured center-right, is
always brighter than all other planets
or stars as seen from Earth. Jupiter
Venus "overtakes" Earth every 584 days as it orbits the Sun.[5] As 
is visible at the top of the image.
it does so, it changes from the "Evening Star", visible after sunset,
to the "Morning Star", visible before sunrise. Although Mercury, the other inferior planet, reaches a
maximum elongation of only 28° and is often difficult to discern in twilight, Venus is hard to miss when it is
at its brightest. Its greater maximum elongation means it is visible in dark skies long after sunset. As the
brightest point-like object in the sky, Venus is a commonly misreported "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object"] unidentified flying object".[148]
Phases
Page 11
As it orbits the Sun, Venus displays [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_Venus"] phases like those of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon"] Moon
in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_telescope"] telescopic view. The planet appears as a small and "full" disc
when it is on the opposite side of the Sun (at superior conjunction).
Venus shows a larger disc and "quarter phase" at its maximum
 elongations from the Sun, and appears its brightest in the night sky.
The planet presents a much larger thin "crescent" in telescopic
views as it passes along the near side between Earth and the Sun.
Venus displays its largest size and "new phase" when it is between
Earth and the Sun (at inferior conjunction). Its atmosphere is visible
through telescopes by the halo of sunlight refracted around it.[147]
The phases are clearly visible in a 4" telescope.

Transits
The Venusian orbit is slightly
inclined relative to Earth's orbit; thus, when the planet passes between
 Earth and the Sun, it usually does not cross the face of the Sun. Transits of
Venus occur when the planet's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_conjunction"] inferior conjunction coincides with its
presence in the plane of Earth's orbit. Transits of Venus occur in cycles of
243 years with the current pattern of transits being pairs of transits
separated by eight years, at intervals of about 105.5 years or 121.5 years—
 a pattern first discovered in 1639 by the English astronomer Jeremiah
Horrocks.[149]
The latest pair was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus,_2004"] June 8, 2004 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus,_2012"] June 5–6, 2012. The transit could be
watched live from many online outlets or observed locally with the right
equipment and conditions.[150] 
 Transit of Venus, 2004
The preceding pair of transits occurred in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus,_1874"] December 1874 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus,_1882"] December 1882; the following pair will
occur in December 2117 and December 2125.[151] The 1874 transit is the subject of the oldest film known,
the 1874 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passage_de_Venus"] Passage de Venus.  Historically, transits of Venus were important, because they allowed
 astronomers to determine the size of the astronomical unit, and hence the size of the Solar System as shown
by Horrocks in 1639.[152] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Cook"] Captain Cook's exploration of the east coast of Australia came after he had sailed
to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahiti"] Tahiti in 1768 to observe a transit of Venus.[153][154]
Pentagram of Venus
 The pentagram of Venus is the path that Venus makes as observed from Earth. Successive inferior
conjunctions of Venus repeat very near a 13:8 ratio (Earth orbits eight times for every 13 orbits of Venus),
shifting 144° upon sequential inferior conjunctions. The 13:8 ratio is approximate. 8/13 is approximately
0.61538 while Venus orbits the Sun in 0.61519 years.[155] The pentagram of Venus is sometimes also
referred to as the petals of Venus due to the path's visual similarity to a flower.[156]
Daylight apparitions
Naked-eye observations of Venus during daylight hours exist in several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdote"] anecdotes and records. Astronomer
 Edmund Halley calculated its maximum naked eye brightness in 1716, when many Londoners were
alarmed by its appearance in the daytime. French emperor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte"] Napoleon Bonaparte once witnessed a daytime
apparition of the planet while at a reception in Luxembourg.[157] Another historical daytime observation of
Page 12
the planet took place during the inauguration of the American president
 Abraham Lincoln in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."] Washington, D.C., on 4 March 1865.[158] Although
naked eye visibility of Venus's phases is disputed, records exist of
observations of its crescent.[159]
Ashen light
A long-standing mystery of Venus observations is the so-called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashen_light"] ashen light
—an apparent weak illumination of its dark side, seen when the planet is in
the crescent phase. The first claimed observation of ashen light was made
in 1643, but the existence of the illumination has never been reliably
confirmed. Observers have speculated it may result from electrical activity
in the Venusian atmosphere, but it could be illusory, resulting from the
physiological effect of observing a bright, crescent-shaped object.[160][65]
The ashen light has often been sighted when Venus is in the evening sky,
when the evening terminator of the planet is towards to Earth.

Observation and exploration
Early observation
Because the movements of Venus appear to be discontinuous (it
disappears due to its proximity to the sun, for many days at a time,
and then reappears on the other horizon), some cultures did not
recognize Venus as a single entity;[161] instead, they assumed it to
be two separate stars on each horizon: the morning and evening
star.[161] Nonetheless, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_seal"] cylinder seal from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jemdet_Nasr_period"] Jemdet Nasr period
 and the Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa from the First Babylonian
dynasty indicate that the ancient Sumerians already knew that the
morning and evening stars were the same celestial
object.[162][161][163] In the Old [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia"] Babylonian period, the planet
Venus was known as Ninsi'anna, and later as Dilbat.[164] The name
"Ninsi'anna" translates to "divine lady, illumination of heaven",
which refers to Venus as the brightest visible "star".  Earlier
spellings of the name were written with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuneiform_script"] cuneiform sign si4 (=
SU, meaning "to be red"), and the original meaning may have been
"divine lady of the redness of heaven", in reference to the colour of
the morning and evening sky.[165] 
The "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_drop_effect"] black drop effect" as recorded
during the 1769 transit
The Chinese historically referred to the morning Venus as "the Great White" (Tàibái 
太白) or "the Opener
(Starter) of Brightness" (Qǐmíng 
啟明), and the evening Venus as "the Excellent West One" (Chánggēng
長庚).[166]
The ancient Greeks also initially believed Venus to be two separate stars: Phosphorus, the morning star, and
Hesperus, the evening star. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder"] Pliny the Elder credited the realization that they were a single object to
 Pythagoras in the sixth century BC,[167] while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_La%C3%ABrtius"] Diogenes Laërtius argued that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides"] Parmenides was probably
responsible for this discovery.[168] Though they recognized Venus as a single object, the ancient Romans
continued to designate the morning aspect of Venus as Lucifer, literally "Light-Bringer", and the evening
aspect as Vesper,[169] both of which are literal translations of their traditional Greek names.
Page 13
In the second century, in his astronomical treatise [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest"] Almagest, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy"] Ptolemy theorized that both Mercury and
Venus are located between the Sun and the Earth. The 11th-century [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_in_medieval_Islam"] Persian astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna"] Avicenna claimed
to have observed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Venus"] transit of Venus,[170] which later astronomers took as confirmation of Ptolemy's
theory.[171] In the 12th century, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus"] Andalusian astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Bajjah"] Ibn Bajjah observed "two planets as black spots
on the face of the Sun"; these were thought to be the transits of Venus and Mercury by 13th-century
 Maragha astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qotb_al-Din_Shirazi"] Qotb al-Din Shirazi, though this cannot be true as there were no Venus transits in Ibn
Bajjah's lifetime.[172][n 3]
 Galileo's discovery that Venus
showed phases (although remaining
near the Sun in Earth's sky) proved
that it orbits the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"] Sun and not Earth. 
When the Italian physicist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei"] Galileo Galilei first observed the planet
in the early 17th century, he found it showed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_phase"] phases like the Moon,
varying from crescent to gibbous to full and vice versa. When
Venus is furthest from the Sun in the sky, it shows a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elongation_(astronomy)"] half-lit phase,
and when it is closest to the Sun in the sky, it shows as a crescent or
full phase. This could be possible only if Venus orbited the Sun,
and this was among the first observations to clearly contradict the
 Ptolemaic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model"] geocentric model that the Solar System was concentric
and centred on Earth.[175][176]
 The 1639 transit of Venus was accurately predicted by Jeremiah
Horrocks and observed by him and his friend, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Crabtree"] William Crabtree, at
each of their respective homes, on 4 December 1639 (24
November under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_calendar"] Julian calendar in use at that time).[177]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Venus"] atmosphere of Venus was discovered in 1761 by Russian polymath [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Lomonosov"] Mikhail Lomonosov.[178][179]
Venus's atmosphere was observed in 1790 by German astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Schr%C3%B6ter"] Johann Schröter. Schröter found when
the planet was a thin crescent, the cusps extended through more than 180°. He correctly surmised this was
due to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattering"] scattering of sunlight in a dense atmosphere. Later, American astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Smith_Lyman"] Chester Smith Lyman
observed a complete ring around the dark side of the planet when it was at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferior_conjunction"] inferior conjunction, providing
further evidence for an atmosphere.[180] The atmosphere complicated efforts to determine a rotation period
for the planet, and observers such as Italian-born astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Cassini"] Giovanni Cassini and Schröter incorrectly
estimated periods of about 24 h from the motions of markings on the planet's apparent surface.[181]
Ground-based research
Little more was discovered about Venus until the 20th century. Its
almost featureless disc gave no hint what its surface might be like,
and it was only with the development of spectroscopic, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar"] radar and
 ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed. The
first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the 1920s, when
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_E._Ross"] Frank E. Ross found that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_photography"] ultraviolet photographs revealed
considerable detail that was absent in visible and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"] infrared radiation.
He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere
with high [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrus_cloud"] cirrus clouds above it.[182]
Spectroscopic observations in the 1900s gave the first clues about Modern telescopic view of Venus
 the Venusian rotation. Vesto Slipher tried to measure the Doppler from Earth's surface
shift of light from Venus, but found he could not detect any
rotation. He surmised the planet must have a much longer rotation
period than had previously been thought.[183] Later work in the 1950s showed the rotation was retrograde.
 Radar observations of Venus were first carried out in the 1960s, and provided the first measurements of the
rotation period, which were close to the modern value.[184]
Page 14
Radar observations in the 1970s revealed details of the Venusian surface for the first time. Pulses of radio
waves were beamed at the planet using the 300 m (1,000 ft) radio telescope at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Observatory"] Arecibo Observatory, and
the echoes revealed two highly reflective regions, designated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Regio"] Alpha and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Regio"] Beta regions. The observations
also revealed a bright region attributed to mountains, which was called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Montes"] Maxwell Montes.[185] These three
features are now the only ones on Venus that do not have female names.[88]
Exploration
The first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_spacecraft"] robotic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe"] space probe mission to Venus and any planet was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_1"] Venera 1 of the Soviet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_program"] Venera program
launched in 1961, though it lost contact en route.[186]
The first successful mission to Venus (as well as the world's first
successful [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplanetary_spaceflight"] interplanetary mission) was the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_2"] Mariner 2 mission by the
United States, passing on 14 December 1962 at 34,833 km
(21,644 mi) above the surface of Venus and gathering data on the
planet's atmosphere.[187][188]
On 18 October 1967, the Soviet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venera_4"] Venera 4 successfully entered as
the first to probe the atmosphere and deployed science experiments.
Venera 4 showed the surface temperature was hotter than Mariner
2 had calculated, at almost 500 °C (932 °F), determined that the
atmosphere was 95% carbon dioxide (CO2
), and discovered that
Venus's atmosphere was considerably denser than Venera 4's
designers had anticipated.[189] The joint Venera 4–[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_5"] Mariner 5 data
were analysed by a combined Soviet–American science team in a
series of colloquia over the following year,[190] in an early example
of space cooperation.[191]
In 1974, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_10"] Mariner 10 swung by Venus to bend its path toward
Mercury and took ultraviolet photographs of the clouds, revealing
the extraordinarily high wind speeds in the Venusian atmosphere.

the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency"] European Space Agency (ESA) entered orbit around Venus in April 2006. Equipped with seven
scientific instruments, Venus Express provided unprecedented long-term observation of Venus's atmosphere.
ESA concluded the Venus Express mission in December 2014.[195]
As of 2020, Japan's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akatsuki_(spacecraft)"] Akatsuki is in a highly eccentric orbit around Venus since 7 December 2015, and there
are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observations_and_explorations_of_Venus#Under_study"] several probing proposals under study by Roscosmos, NASA, ISRO, ESA, and the private sector (e.g.
by Rocketlab).
In culture
Venus is a primary feature of the night sky, and so has been of
remarkable importance in mythology, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planets_in_astrology#Venus"] astrology and fiction
throughout history and in different cultures.
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_religion"] Sumerian religion, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inanna"] Inanna was associated with the planet
Venus.[198][199] Several hymns praise Inanna in her role as the
goddess of the planet Venus.[161][199][198] Theology professor
Jeffrey Cooley has argued that, in many myths, Inanna's
movements may correspond with the movements of the planet
Venus in the sky.[161] The discontinuous movements of Venus
relate to both mythology as well as Inanna's dual nature.[161] In
Inanna's Descent to the Underworld, unlike any other deity, Inanna
is able to descend into the netherworld and return to the heavens. 
Venus is portrayed just to the right of
 the large cypress tree in Vincent van
 Gogh's 1889 painting The Starry
Night.[196][197]
The planet Venus appears to make a similar descent, setting in the
West and then rising again in the East.[161] An introductory hymn
describes Inanna leaving the heavens and heading for Kur, what could be presumed to be, the mountains,
 replicating the rising and setting of Inanna to the West.[161] In Inanna and Shukaletuda and Inanna's
Descent into the Underworld appear to parallel the motion of the planet Venus.[161] In Inanna and
Shukaletuda, Shukaletuda is described as scanning the heavens in search of Inanna, possibly searching the
eastern and western horizons.[200] In the same myth, while searching for her attacker, Inanna herself makes
several movements that correspond with the movements of Venus in the sky.[161]
Classical poets such as Homer, Sappho, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid"] Ovid and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil"] Virgil spoke of the star and its light.[201] Poets such as
 William Blake, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frost"] Robert Frost, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letitia_Elizabeth_Landon"] Letitia Elizabeth Landon, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Lord_Tennyson"] Alfred Lord Tennyson and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wordsworth"] William Wordsworth
wrote odes to it.[202]
Page 16
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language"] Chinese the planet is called Jīn-xīng (
金星), the golden planet of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_(Wu_Xing)"] metal element. In India Shukra
Graha ("the planet Shukra") is named after the powerful saint Shukra. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shukra"] Shukra which is used in Indian
 Vedic astrology[203] means "clear, pure" or "brightness, clearness" in Sanskrit. One of the nine Navagraha,
it is held to affect wealth, pleasure and reproduction; it was the son of Bhrgu, preceptor of the Daityas, and
guru of the Asuras.[204] The word Shukra is also associated with semen, or generation. Venus is known as
Kejora in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language"] Indonesian and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_language"] Malaysi
金星an Malay. Modern Chinese, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_culture"] Japanese and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_culture"] Korean cultures refer to the
planet literally as the "metal star" (  ), based on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_elements_(Chinese_philosophy)"] Five elements.[205][206][207]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization"] Maya considered Venus to be the most important celestial body after the Sun and Moon. They called it
Chac ek,[208] or Noh Ek', "the Great Star".[209] The cycles of Venus were important to their calendar and
were described in some of their books such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_Codex_of_Mexico"] Maya Codex of Mexico and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden_Codex"] Dresden Codex.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt"] Ancient Egyptians and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece"] Greeks believed Venus to be two separate bodies, a morning star and an
evening star. The Egyptians knew the morning star as Tioumoutiri and the evening star as Ouaiti.[210] The
Greeks used the names [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoros"] Phōsphoros (Φωσϕόρος),  meaning "light-bringer" (whence the element
phosphorus; alternately Ēōsphoros (Ἠωσϕόρος), meaning "dawn-bringer"),  for the morning star, and
 Hesperos (Ἕσπερος), meaning "Western one", for the evening star.[211] Though by the Roman era they
were recognized as one celestial object, known as "the star of Venus", the traditional two Greek names
continued to be used, though usually translated to Latin as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer"] Lūcifer and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesperus"] Vesper.[211][212]
Modern fiction
With the invention of the telescope, the idea that Venus was a physical world and possible destination
began to take form.
The impenetrable Venusian cloud cover gave science fiction writers free rein to speculate on conditions at
its surface; all the more so when early observations showed that not only was it similar in size to Earth, it
possessed a substantial atmosphere. Closer to the Sun than Earth, the planet was frequently depicted as
warmer, but still [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_habitability"] habitable by humans.[213] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre"] genre reached its peak between the 1930s and 1950s, at a
time when science had revealed some aspects of Venus, but not yet the harsh reality of its surface
conditions. Findings from the first missions to Venus showed the reality to be quite different and brought
this particular genre to an end.[214] As scientific knowledge of Venus advanced, science fiction authors
tried to keep pace, particularly by conjecturing human attempts to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraforming_of_Venus"] terraform Venus.[215]
Symbol 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_symbols"] astronomical symbol for Venus is the same as that used in biology for the female sex: a
circle with a small cross beneath.[216][217] The Venus symbol also represents femininity, and
in Western [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy"] alchemy stood for the metal copper.[216][217] Polished copper has been used for
mirrors from antiquity, and the symbol for Venus has sometimes been understood to stand for
 the mirror of the goddess although that may not be its true origin.[216][217] In the Greek Oxyrhynchus
Papyri, the symbols for Venus and Mercury didn't have the cross-bar on the bottom stroke.[218]
Habitability
Speculation on the possibility of life on Venus's surface decreased significantly after the early 1960s when it
became clear that the conditions are extreme compared to those on Earth. Venus's extreme temperature and
atmospheric pressure make water-based [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life"] life as currently known unlikely.
Page 17
Some scientists have speculated that thermoacidophilic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremophile"] extremophile [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"] microorganisms might exist in the
cooler, acidic upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere).[219][220][221] Such speculations go back to 1967,
when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan"] Carl Sagan and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_J._Morowitz"] Harold J. Morowitz suggested in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)"] Nature article that tiny objects detected in Venus's
clouds might be organisms similar to Earth's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"] bacteria (which are of approximately the same size):
While the surface conditions of Venus make the hypothesis of life there implausible, the
clouds of Venus are a different story altogether. As was pointed out some years ago, water,
 carbon dioxide and sunlight—the prerequisites for photosynthesis—are plentiful in the
vicinity of the clouds.[222]
In August 2019, astronomers led by Yeon Joo Lee reported that long-term pattern of absorbance and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo"] albedo
changes in the atmosphere of the planet Venus caused by "unknown absorbers", which may be chemicals
or even large colonies of microorganisms high up in the atmosphere of the planet, affect the climate.[62]
Their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_absorption"] light absorbance is almost identical to that of micro-organisms in Earth's clouds. Similar conclusions
have been reached by other studies.[223]
In September 2020, a team of astronomers led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Greaves"] Jane Greaves from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_University"] Cardiff University announced the
likely detection of phosphine, a gas not known to be produced by any known chemical processes on the
Venusian surface or atmosphere, in the upper levels of the planet's clouds.[224][225][226][227][228] One
proposed source for this phosphine is living organisms.[229] The phosphine was detected at heights of at
least 30 miles above the surface, and primarily at mid-latitudes with none detected at the poles. The
discovery prompted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA"] NASA administrator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Bridenstine"] Jim Bridenstine to publicly call for a new focus on the study of
Venus, describing the phosphine find as "the most significant development yet in building the case for life
off Earth".[230][231]
Subsequent analysis of the data-processing used to identify phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus has
raised concerns that the detection-line may be an artefact. The use of a 12th-order polynomial fit may have
amplified noise and generated a false reading (see [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%27s_phenomenon"] Runge's phenomenon). Observations of the atmosphere
of Venus at other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum in which a phosphine absorption line would be
expected did not detect phosphine.[232] By late October 2020, re-analysis of data with a proper subtraction
of background did not show a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistically_significant"] statistically significant detection of phosphine.[233][234][235]
Planetary protection
 The Committee on Space Research is a scientific organization established by the International Council for
 Science. Among their responsibilities is the development of recommendations for avoiding interplanetary
contamination. For this purpose, space missions are categorized into five groups. Due to the harsh surface
environment of Venus, Venus has been under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_protection"] planetary protection category two.[236] This indicates that
there is only a remote chance that spacecraft-borne contamination could compromise investigations.
Human presence
Venus is the place of the very first interplanetary human presence, mediated through robotic missions, with
the first successful landings on another planet and extraterrestrial body other than the Moon. Venus was at
the beginning of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_age"] space age frequently visited by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe"] space probes until the 1990s. Currently in orbit is
Akatsuki, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Solar_Probe"] Parker Solar Probe routinely uses Venus for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist"] gravity assist maneuvers.[237]
The only nation that has sent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lander_(spacecraft)"] lander probes to the surface of Venus has been the Soviet Union,[a] which has
been used by Russian officials to call Venus a "Russian planet".[238][239]
Page 18
Habitation
While the surface conditions of Venus are very inhospitable, the atmospheric pressure and temperature fifty
kilometres above the surface are similar to those at Earth's surface. With this in mind the Soviet engineer
Sergey Zhitomirskiy (Сергей Житомирский, 1929–2004) in 1971[240][241] and more contemporarily
NASA aerospace engineer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_A._Landis"] Geoffrey A. Landis in 2003[242] suggested the use of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerostat"] aerostats for crewed
exploration and possibly for permanent "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_cities_and_islands_in_fiction#Venus"] floating cities" in the Venusian atmosphere, an alternative to the
popular idea of living on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_surface"] planetary surfaces such as Mars.[243][244] Among the many engineering
challenges for any human presence in the atmosphere of Venus are the corrosive amounts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid"] sulfuric acid in
the atmosphere.[242]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Altitude_Venus_Operational_Concept"] High Altitude Venus Operational Concept (HAVOC) by NASA is a mission concept that proposed a
crewed aerostat design.

Notes
1. Misstated as "Ganiki Chasma" in the press release and scientific publication.[101]
2. It is important to be clear about the meaning of "closeness". In the astronomical literature, the
term "closest planets" often refers to the two planets that approach each other the most
closely. In other words, the orbits of the two planets approach each other most closely.
However, this does not mean that the two planets are closest over time. Essentially because
Mercury is closer to the Sun than Venus, Mercury spends more time in proximity to Earth; it
could, therefore, be said that Mercury is the planet that is "closest to Earth when averaged
over time". However, using this time-average definition of "closeness", it turns out that
Mercury is the closest planet to all other planets in the solar system. For that reason,
arguably, the proximity-definition is not particularly helpful. An episode of the BBC Radio 4
programme "More or Less" explains the different notions of proximity well.[123]
3. Several claims of transit observations made by medieval Islamic astronomers have been
shown to be sunspots.[173] Avicenna did not record the date of his observation. There was a
transit of Venus within his lifetime, on 24 May 1032, although it is questionable whether it
would have been visible from his location.[174]

129. The equatorial speed of Earth is given as both about 1674.4 km/h and 1669.8 km/h by
reliable sources. The simplest way to determine the correct figure is to multiply Earth's
radius of 6 378 137 m (WGS84) and Earth's angular speed, 7.292 1150 ×10−5 rad/s,[126]
yielding 465.1011 m/s = 1674.364 km/h. The incorrect figure of 1669.8 km/h is obtained by
dividing Earth's equatorial circumference by 24 h. But the correct speed must be relative to
inertial space, so the stellar day of 86 164.098 903 691 s/3600 = 23.934 472 h
(23 h 56 m 4.0989 s) must be used.[127] Thus 2π(6378.137 km)
23.934472 h 
= 1674.364 km/h.[128]
