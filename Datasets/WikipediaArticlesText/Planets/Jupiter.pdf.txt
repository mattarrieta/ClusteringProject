Jupiter
Jupiter is the fifth [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet"] planet from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"] Sun
and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Solar_System_objects_by_size"] largest in the Solar System. It
is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant"] gas giant with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"] mass more than
two and a half times that of all the
other planets in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System"] Solar System
combined, but slightly less than one-
thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter
is the third brightest natural object in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"] Earth's night sky after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon"] Moon
and Venus, and it has been observed
since [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-history"] prehistoric times. It was named
after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(mythology)"] Roman god Jupiter, the king
of the gods.
Jupiter is primarily composed of
hydrogen, but [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium"] helium constitutes one-
quarter of its mass and one-tenth of its
volume. It probably has a rocky core
of heavier elements,[16] but, like the
other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_planet"] giant planets in the Solar System,
it lacks a well-defined solid surface.
The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's
interior generates more heat than it
receives from the Sun. Because of its
rapid rotation, the planet's shape is an
 oblate spheroid: it has a slight but
noticeable bulge around the equator.
The outer atmosphere is divided into a
series of latitudinal bands, with
turbulence and storms along their
interacting boundaries. A prominent
result of this is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot"] Great Red Spot, a
giant storm which has been observed
since at least 1831.
Jupiter is surrounded by a  faint
 planetary ring system and a powerful
magnetosphere. Jupiter's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_tail"] magnetic tail
is nearly 800 million km (5.3 AU;
500 million mi) long, covering nearly
the entire distance to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn"] Saturn's orbit.
Jupiter has [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Jupiter"] 80 known moons and
possibly many more,[6] including the
 four large moons discovered by
 Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, 
Jupiter

 Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to
visit Jupiter, making its closest
approach to the planet in December
1973.[17] Jupiter has since been
 explored by multiple robotic
spacecraft, beginning with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_program"] Pioneer
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program"] Voyager [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_flyby"] flyby missions from 1973
 to 1979, and later with the Galileo
 orbiter in 1995.[18] In 2007, the New
 Horizons visited Jupiter using its
gravity to increase its speed, bending
its trajectory en route to Pluto. The
latest probe to visit the planet, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)"] Juno,
entered orbit around Jupiter in July
2016.[19][20] Future targets for
exploration in the Jupiter system
include the probable ice-covered liquid
ocean of Europa.[21]

Name and symbol
In both the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, Jupiter was named after the chief god of the divine
pantheon: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus"] Zeus for the Greeks and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(mythology)"] Jupiter for the Romans. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union"] International Astronomical Union (IAU)
decided to formally adopt the name Jupiter for the planet in 1976. The IAU names newly discovered
 satellites of Jupiter for the mythological lovers, favourites, and descendants of the god.[22] The planetary
symbol for Jupiter, , descends from a Greek [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeta"] zeta with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribal_abbreviation#Forms"] horizontal stroke, ⟨Ƶ⟩, as an abbreviation for
Zeus.[23][24]
Jove, the archaic name of Jupiter, came into use as a poetic name for the planet around the 14th century.[25]
The Romans named the fifth day of the week diēs Iovis ("Jove's Day") after the planet Jupiter.[26] In
 Germanic mythology, Jupiter is equated to Thor, whence the English name Thursday for the Roman dies
Jovis.[27]
The original Greek deity Zeus supplies the root zeno-, used to form some Jupiter-related words, such as
 zenographic.[d] Jovian is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective"] adjectival form of Jupiter. The older adjectival form jovial, employed by
 astrologers in the Middle Ages, has come to mean "happy" or "merry", moods ascribed to Jupiter's
astrological influence.[28]
Formation and migration
Jupiter is believed to be the oldest planet in the Solar System.[29] Current models of Solar System formation
suggest that Jupiter formed at or beyond the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost_line_(astrophysics)"] snow line: a distance from the early Sun where the temperature
is sufficiently cold for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatiles"] volatiles such as water to condense into solids.[30] The planet began as a large solid
core, then accumulated its gaseous atmosphere. As a consequence, the core must have formed before the
Page 4
solar nebula was fully dispersed after 10 million years. Over about a million years, Jupiter's atmosphere
gradually expanded until it had 20 times the mass of the Earth. The orbiting mass created a gap in the solar
nebula, and thereafter the planet slowly increased to 50 Earth masses over 3–4 million years.[29]
According to the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_tack_hypothesis"] grand tack hypothesis",  Jupiter began to form at a distance of roughly 3.5 AU
(520 million km; 330 million mi) from the Sun. As the young planet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_(astrophysics)"] accreted mass, interaction with the gas
disk orbiting the Sun and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance"] orbital resonances with Saturn caused it to migrate inward.[30][31] This upset the
orbits of several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-Earth"] super-Earths orbiting closer to the Sun, causing them to collide destructively. Saturn would
later have begun to migrate inwards too, much faster than Jupiter, until the two planets became captured in
a 3:2 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_motion_resonance"] mean motion resonance at approximately 1.5 AU (220 million km; 140 million mi) from the Sun. This
changed the direction of migration, causing them to migrate away from the Sun and out of the inner system
to their current locations.[32] All of this happened over a period of 3-6 million years, with the final
migration of Jupiter occurring over several hundred thousand years.[31][33] Jupiter's departure from the
inner solar system eventually allowed the inner planets—including Earth—to form from the rubble.[34]
There are several problems with the grand tack hypothesis. The resulting formation timescales of terrestrial
planets appear to be inconsistent with the measured elemental composition.[35] It is likely that Jupiter would
have settled into an orbit much closer to the Sun if it had migrated through the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_nebula"] solar nebula.[36] Some
competing models of Solar System formation predict the formation of Jupiter with orbital properties that are
close to those of the present day planet.[37] Other models predict Jupiter forming at distances much farther
out, such as 18 AU (2.7 billion km; 1.7 billion mi).[38][39]
Based on Jupiter's composition, researchers have made the case for an initial formation outside the
 molecular nitrogen (N2) snowline, which is estimated at 20–30 AU (3.0–4.5 billion km; 1.9–2.8 billion mi)
from the Sun,[40][41] and possibly even outside the argon snowline, which may be as far as 40 AU
(6.0 billion km; 3.7 billion mi). Having formed at one of these extreme distances, Jupiter would then have
migrated inwards to its current location. This inward migration would have occurred over a roughly
700,000-year time period,[38][39] during an epoch approximately 2–3 million years after the planet began to
form. In this model, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune would have formed even further out than Jupiter, and
Saturn would also have migrated inwards.
Physical characteristics
Jupiter is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant"] gas giant, being primarily composed of gas and liquid rather than solid matter. It is the largest
planet in the Solar System, with a diameter of 142,984 km (88,846 mi) at its equator.[42] The average
density of Jupiter, 1.326 g/cm3, is about the same as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_sugar_syrup"] simple syrup (syrup USP),[43] and is lower than those
of the four [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_planet"] terrestrial planets.[44][45]
Composition
Jupiter's upper atmosphere is about 90% hydrogen and 10% helium by volume. Since helium atoms are
more massive than hydrogen molecules, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter"] Jupiter's atmosphere is approximately 24% helium by mass.[46]
The atmosphere contains trace amounts of methane, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor"] water vapour, ammonia, and silicon-based compounds.
There are also fractional amounts of carbon, ethane, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide"] hydrogen sulfide, neon, oxygen, phosphine, and
sulfur. The outermost layer of the atmosphere contains [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal"] crystals of frozen ammonia. Through [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"] infrared and
 ultraviolet measurements, trace amounts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene"] benzene and other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon"] hydrocarbons have also been found.[47] The
interior of Jupiter contains denser materials—by mass it is roughly 71% hydrogen, 24% helium, and 5%
other elements.[48][49]
Page 5
The atmospheric proportions of hydrogen and helium are close to the theoretical composition of the
primordial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_nebula"] solar nebula. Neon in the upper atmosphere only consists of 20 parts per million by mass, which
is about a tenth as abundant as in the Sun.[50] Helium is also reduced to about 80% of the Sun's helium
composition. This depletion is a result of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)"] precipitation of these elements as helium-rich droplets, a process
that happens deep in the interior of the planet.[51][52]
Based on spectroscopy, Saturn is thought to be similar in composition to Jupiter, but the other giant planets
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_the_chemical_elements"] Uranus and Neptune have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more of the next most
 common elements, including oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur.[53] These planets are known as ice
giants, because the majority of their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)"] volatile compounds are in solid form.
Size and mass
Jupiter's mass is 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar
System combined—so massive that its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter"] barycentre with the Sun lies
above the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosphere"] Sun's surface at 1.068 solar [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radius"] radii from the Sun's
centre.[54] Jupiter is much larger than Earth and considerably less
dense: it has 1,321 times the volume of the Earth, but only 318
times the mass.[7][55]: 6  Jupiter's radius is about one tenth the radius
of the Sun,[56] and its mass is one thousandth the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_mass"] mass of the Sun,
as the densities of the two bodies are similar.[57] A "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_mass"] Jupiter mass"
(MJ or MJup) is often used as a unit to describe masses of other
objects, particularly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasolar_planet"] extrasolar planets and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarfs"] brown dwarfs. For
example, the extrasolar planet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_209458_b"] HD 209458 b has a mass of 0.69 MJ,
while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_Andromedae_b"] Kappa Andromedae b has a mass of 12.8 MJ.[58]  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude"] Jupiter's diameter is one order of
magnitude smaller (×0.10045) than
Theoretical models indicate that if Jupiter had over 40% more mass,
the interior would be so compressed that its volume would decrease
despite the increasing amount of matter. For smaller changes in its
mass, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"] radius would not change appreciably.[59] As a result, 
that of the Sun, and one order of
magnitude larger (×10.9733) than
that of Earth. The Great Red Spot is
roughly the same size as Earth.
Jupiter is thought to have about as large a diameter as a planet of its
composition and evolutionary history can achieve.[60] The process
of further shrinkage with increasing mass would continue until appreciable [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_ignition"] stellar ignition was achieved.[61]
Although Jupiter would need to be about 75 times more massive to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_fusion"] fuse hydrogen and become a star,[62]
the smallest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_dwarf"] red dwarf may be only slightly larger in radius than Saturn.[63]
Jupiter radiates more heat than it receives through solar radiation, due to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Helmholtz_mechanism"] Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism
within its contracting interior.[64]: 30 [65] This process causes Jupiter to shrink by about 1 mm
(0.039 in)/yr.[66][67] When it formed, Jupiter was hotter and was about twice its current diameter.[68]
Internal structure
Before the early 21st century, most scientists proposed one of two scenarios for the formation of Jupiter. If
the planet accreted first as a solid body, it would consist of a dense core, a surrounding layer of liquid
 metallic hydrogen (with some helium) extending outward to about 80% of the radius of the planet,[69] and
an outer atmosphere consisting primarily of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_hydrogen"] molecular hydrogen.[67] Alternatively, if the planet collapsed
directly from the gaseous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk"] protoplanetary disk, it was expected to completely lack a core, consisting instead
of denser and denser fluid (predominantly molecular and metallic hydrogen) all the way to the centre. Data
from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)"] Juno mission showed that Jupiter has a very diffuse core that mixes into its mantle.[19][70][71] This
Page 6
could have been caused by an
impact from a planet of about
ten Earth masses a few million
years after Jupiter's formation,
which would have disrupted an
originally solid Jovian
core.[72][73] It is estimated that
the core takes up 30–50% of the
planet's  radius, and contains
heavy elements with a combined
mass 7–25 times the Earth.[74]
Outside the layer of metallic
hydrogen lies a  transparent

interior atmosphere of hydrogen.
At this depth, the pressure and temperature are above molecular hydrogen's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_pressure"] critical pressure of 1.3 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(unit)"] MPa and
 critical temperature of 33 K (−240.2 °C; −400.3 °F).[75] In this state, there are no distinct liquid and gas
phases—hydrogen is said to be in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercritical_fluid"] supercritical fluid state. The hydrogen and helium gas extending
downward from the cloud layer gradually transitions to a liquid in deeper layers, possibly resembling
something akin to an ocean of liquid hydrogen and other supercritical fluids.[64]: 22 [76][77][78] Physically,
the gas gradually becomes hotter and denser as depth increases.[79][80]
Rain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through the lower atmosphere, depleting the
abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere.[51][81] Calculations suggest that helium drops
separate from metallic hydrogen at a radius of 60,000 km (37,000 mi) (11,000 km (6,800 mi) below the
cloudtops) and merge again at 50,000 km (31,000 mi) (22,000 km (14,000 mi) beneath the clouds).[82]
Rainfalls of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_diamonds"] diamonds have been suggested to occur, as well as on Saturn[83] and the ice giants Uranus and
Neptune.[84]
The temperature and pressure inside Jupiter increase steadily inward because the heat of planetary
formation can only escape by convection.[85] At a surface depth where the atmospheric pressure level is
1 bar (0.10 MPa), the temperature is around 165 K (−108 °C; −163 °F). The region of supercritical
hydrogen changes gradually from a molecular fluid to a metallic fluid spans pressure ranges of 50–400 GPa
with temperatures of 5,000–8,400 K (4,730–8,130 °C; 8,540–14,660 °F), respectively. The temperature of
Jupiter's diluted core is estimated to be 20,000 K (19,700 °C; 35,500 °F) with a pressure of around
4,000 GPa.[86]
Atmosphere
The atmosphere of Jupiter extends to a depth of 3,000 km (2,000 mi) below the cloud layers.[86]
Cloud layers
Jupiter is perpetually covered with clouds of ammonia crystals, which may contain [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_hydrosulfide"] ammonium hydrosulfide
as well.[87] The clouds are located in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause"] tropopause layer of the atmosphere, forming bands at different
latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are subdivided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The
interactions of these conflicting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation"] circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100
metres per second (360 km/h; 220 mph) are common in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream#Other_planets"] zonal jet streams.[88] The zones have been
observed to vary in width, colour and intensity from year to year, but they have remained stable enough for
scientists to name them.[55]: 6 
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jupiter_diagram.svg"]
Page 7
The cloud layer is about 50 km (31 mi) deep,
and consists of at least two decks of ammonia
clouds: a thin clearer region on top with a thick
lower deck. There may be a thin layer of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_(properties)"] water
clouds underlying the ammonia clouds, as
suggested by flashes of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning"] lightning detected in the
atmosphere of Jupiter.[89] These electrical
discharges can be up to a thousand times as
powerful as lightning on Earth.[90] The water
clouds are assumed to generate thunderstorms in
the same way as terrestrial thunderstorms, driven
by the heat rising from the interior.[91] The Juno 
View of Jupiter's south pole Enhanced colour view of
Jupiter's southern storms
mission revealed the presence of "shallow
lightning" which originates from ammonia-
water clouds relatively high in the atmosphere.[92] These discharges carry "mushballs" of water-ammonia
slushes covered in ice, which fall deep into the atmosphere.[93] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper-atmospheric_lightning"] Upper-atmospheric lightning has been
observed in Jupiter's upper atmosphere, bright flashes of light that last around 1.4 milliseconds. These are
known as "elves" or "sprites" and appear blue or pink due to the hydrogen.[94][95]
The orange and brown colours in the clouds of Jupiter are caused by
upwelling compounds that change colour when they are exposed to
ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the
substances are thought to be made up of phosphorus, sulfur or possibly
hydrocarbons.[64]: 39 [96] These colourful compounds, known as
chromophores, mix with the warmer clouds of the lower deck. The light-
coloured zones are formed when rising [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_cell"] convection cells form crystallising
ammonia that hides the chromophores from view.[97]
 Jupiter's low axial tilt means that the poles always receive less solar
radiation than the planet's equatorial region. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection"] Convection within the interior
of the planet transports energy to the poles, balancing out the temperatures
at the cloud layer.[55]: 54

adjacent to the Great Red Spot.[102][103] The storm is visible through
Earth-based [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope"] telescopes with an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture"] aperture of 12 cm or larger.[104] The oval object rotates anticlockwise, with
a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(physics)"] period of about six days.[105] The maximum altitude of this storm is about 8 km (5 mi) above the
surrounding cloudtops.[106] The Spot's composition and the source of its red colour remain uncertain,
although photodissociated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia"] ammonia reacting with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene"] acetylene is a likely explanation.[107]
The Great Red Spot is larger than the Earth.[108] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"] Mathematical models suggest that the storm is stable and
will be a permanent feature of the planet.[109] However, it has significantly decreased in size since its
discovery. Initial observations in the late 1800s showed it to be approximately 41,000 km (25,500 mi)
across. By the time of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program"] Voyager flybys in 1979, the storm had a length of 23,300 km (14,500 mi) and a
width of approximately 13,000 km (8,000 mi).[110] Hubble observations in 1995 showed it had decreased
in size to 20,950 km (13,020 mi), and observations in 2009 showed the size to be 17,910 km (11,130 mi).

As of 2015, the storm was measured at approximately 16,500
by 10,940 km (10,250 by 6,800 mi),[110] and was decreasing
in length by about 930 km (580 mi) per year.[108][111] In
October 2021, a Juno flyby mission measured the depth of the
Great Red Spot, putting it at around 300–500 kilometres (190–
310 mi).[112]
Juno missions show that there are several polar cyclone groups
at Jupiter's poles. The northern group contains nine cyclones,
Close up of the Great Red Spot imaged by
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_spacecraft"] Juno spacecraft in April 2018 
with a large one in the centre and eight others around it, while
its southern counterpart also consists of a centre vortex but is
surrounded by five large storms and a single smaller
one.[113][114] These polar structures are caused by the
turbulence in Jupiter's atmosphere and can be compared with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_hexagon"] hexagon at Saturn's north pole.
In 2000, an atmospheric feature formed in the southern hemisphere that is
similar in appearance to the Great Red Spot, but smaller. This was created
when smaller, white oval-shaped storms merged to form a single feature—
these three smaller white ovals were formed in 1939–1940. The merged
feature was named [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_BA"] Oval BA. It has since increased in intensity and
changed from white to red, giving it the nickname "Little Red
Spot".[116][117]  The Great Red Spot is
In April 2017, a "Great Cold Spot" was discovered in Jupiter's
thermosphere at its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter%27s_North_Pole"] north pole. This feature is 24,000 km (15,000 mi) 
decreasing in size (May 15,
2014)[115]
across, 12,000 km (7,500 mi) wide, and 200 °C (360 °F) cooler than
surrounding material. While this spot changes form and intensity over the short term, it has maintained its
general position in the atmosphere for more than 15 years. It may be a giant [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex"] vortex similar to the Great Red
Spot, and appears to be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability"] quasi-stable like the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorticity"] vortices in Earth's thermosphere. This feature may be formed
by interactions between charged particles generated from Io and the strong magnetic field of Jupiter,
resulting in a redistribution of heat flow.[118]

Jupiter's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field"] magnetic field is the strongest of any planet in the Solar System,[97] with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dipole_moment"] dipole moment of 4.170
 gauss (0.4170 mT) that is tilted at an angle of 10.31° to the pole of rotation. The surface magnetic field
strength varies from 2 gauss (0.20 mT) up to 20 gauss (2.0 mT).[119] This field is thought to be generated
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current"] eddy currents—swirling movements of conducting materials—within the liquid metallic hydrogen core.
At about 75 Jupiter radii from the planet, the interaction of the magnetosphere with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"] solar wind generates
a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_shock"] bow shock. Surrounding Jupiter's magnetosphere is a magnetopause, located at the inner edge of a
Page 9
magnetosheath—a region between it and the bow shock. The solar wind interacts with these regions,
elongating the magnetosphere on Jupiter's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_side"] lee side and extending it outward until it nearly reaches the orbit
of Saturn. The four largest moons of Jupiter all orbit within the magnetosphere, which protects them from
the solar wind.[64]: 69 
The volcanoes on the moon [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon)"] Io emit large amounts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide"] sulfur dioxide, forming a gas [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus"] torus along the moon's
orbit. The gas is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"] ionized in Jupiter's magnetosphere, producing sulfur and oxygen ions. They, together with
hydrogen ions originating from the atmosphere of Jupiter, form a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_sheet"] plasma sheet in Jupiter's equatorial plane.
The plasma in the sheet co-rotates with the planet, causing deformation of the dipole magnetic field into that
of a magnetodisk. Electrons within the plasma sheet generate a strong radio signature, with short,
superimposed bursts in the range of 0.6–30 MHz that are detectable from Earth with consumer-grade
 shortwave radio receivers.[120][121] As Io moves through this torus, the interaction generates [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfv%C3%A9n_wave"] Alfvén waves
that carry ionized matter into the polar regions of Jupiter. As a result, radio waves are generated through a
 cyclotron [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_maser"] maser mechanism, and the energy is transmitted out along a cone-shaped surface. When Earth
intersects this cone, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_wave"] radio emissions from Jupiter can exceed the radio output of the Sun.[122]
Orbit and rotation
Jupiter is the only planet whose [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter"] barycentre with the Sun lies outside
the volume of the Sun, though by only 7% of the Sun's
radius.[123][124][125] The average distance between Jupiter and the
Sun is 778 million km (5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every
11.86 years. This is approximately two-fifths the orbital period of
Saturn, forming a near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance"] orbital resonance.[126] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_plane"] orbital plane of
Jupiter is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination"] inclined 1.30° compared to Earth. Because the
 eccentricity of its orbit is 0.049, Jupiter is slightly over
75 million km nearer the Sun at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion"] perihelion than aphelion.[7]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt"] axial tilt of Jupiter is relatively small, only 3.13°, so its seasons
are insignificant compared to those of Earth and Mars.[127]
Jupiter's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_of_revolution"] rotation is the fastest of all the Solar System's planets,
completing a rotation on its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_axis"] axis in slightly less than ten hours; this
creates an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_bulge"] equatorial bulge easily seen through an amateur
telescope. Because Jupiter is not a solid body, its upper atmosphere
undergoes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_rotation"] differential rotation. The rotation of Jupiter's polar
atmosphere is about 5 minutes longer than that of the equatorial
atmosphere.[128] The planet is an oblate spheroid, meaning that the
diameter across its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator"] equator is longer than the diameter measured
between its poles.[80] On Jupiter, the equatorial diameter is
9,276 km (5,764 mi) longer than the polar diameter.[7] 
Jupiter (red) completes one orbit of
the Sun (centre) for every 11.86
orbits by Earth (blue)
Three systems are used as frames of reference for tracking the
planetary rotation, particularly when graphing the motion of
atmospheric features. System I applies to latitudes from 7° N to
7° S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II 
A rotation time-lapse of Jupiter over
3 hours
applies at latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55m
40.6s.[129] System III was defined by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomer"] radio astronomers and corresponds to the rotation of the planet's
magnetosphere; its period is Jupiter's official rotation.[130]

Observation
 Jupiter is usually the fourth brightest object in
the sky (after the Sun, the Moon, and
Venus),[97] although at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_(astronomy)"] opposition [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars#Viewing"] Mars can
appear brighter than Jupiter. Depending on
Jupiter's position with respect to the Earth, it can
vary in visual magnitude from as bright as −2.94
at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_(astronomy)"] opposition down to −1.66 during [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astronomy_and_astrology)"] conjunction
with the Sun.[12] The mean apparent magnitude
is −2.20 with a standard deviation of 0.33.[12]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter"] angular diameter of Jupiter likewise varies 
Conjunction of Jupiter The retrograde motion of an outer
and the Moon planet is caused by its relative
location with respect to Earth
from 50.1 to 30.5 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_second"] arc seconds.[7] Favourable
oppositions occur when Jupiter is passing through the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apsis"] perihelion of its orbit, bringing it closer to Earth.[131]
Near opposition, Jupiter will appear to go into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_retrograde_motion"] retrograde motion for a period of about 121 days, moving
backward through an angle of 9.9° before returning to prograde movement.[132]
Because the orbit of Jupiter is outside that of Earth, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_angle_(astronomy)"] phase angle of Jupiter as viewed from Earth is
always less than 11.5°; thus, Jupiter always appears nearly fully illuminated when viewed through Earth-
based telescopes. It was only during spacecraft missions to Jupiter that crescent views of the planet were
obtained.[133] A small telescope will usually show Jupiter's four [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons"] Galilean moons and the prominent cloud
belts across [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter"] Jupiter's atmosphere. A larger telescope with an aperture of 4–6 in (10.16–15.24 cm) will show
Jupiter's Great Red Spot when it faces Earth.[134][135]
History of research and exploration
Pre-telescopic research
 Observation of Jupiter dates back to at least the Babylonian
astronomers of the 7th or 8th century BC.[136] The ancient Chinese
knew Jupiter as the "Suì Star" (Suìxīng 
歲星) and established their
cycle of 12 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthly_branches"] earthly branches based on the approximate number of
years it takes Jupiter to rotate around
歲 the Sun; the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language"] Chinese language
still uses its name ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_characters"] simplified as ) when referring to years of age.
By the 4th century BC, these observations had developed into the
 Chinese zodiac,[137] and each year became associated with a Tai
Sui [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_astronomy"] star and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_gods"] god controlling the region of the heavens opposite
Jupiter's position in the night sky. These beliefs survive in some
 Taoist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_folk_religion"] religious practices and in the East Asian zodiac's twelve
 animals. The Chinese historian Xi Zezong has claimed that Gan
De, an ancient [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_astronomy"] Chinese astronomer,[138] reported a small star "in
alliance" with the planet,[139] which may indicate a sighting of one
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Jupiter"] Jupiter's moons with the unaided eye. If true, this would predate
Galileo's discovery by nearly two millennia.[140][141]

A 2016 paper reports that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule"] trapezoidal rule was used by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon"] Babylonians before 50 BCE for integrating the
velocity of Jupiter along the ecliptic.[142] In his 2nd century work the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest"] Almagest, the Hellenistic astronomer
 Claudius Ptolemaeus constructed a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric"] geocentric planetary model based on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent"] deferents and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicycle"] epicycles to explain
Page 11
Jupiter's motion relative to Earth, giving its orbital period around Earth as 4332.38 days, or
11.86 years.[143]
Ground-based telescope research
In 1610, Italian polymath [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei"] Galileo Galilei discovered the four largest
moons of Jupiter (now known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moon"] Galilean moons) using a telescope.
This is thought to be the first telescopic observation of moons other than
Earth's. Just one day after Galileo, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Marius"] Simon Marius independently
discovered moons around Jupiter, though he did not publish his discovery
in a book until 1614.[144] It was Marius's names for the major moons,
however, that stuck: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. The discovery
was a major point in favour of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus"] Copernicus' [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism"] heliocentric theory of the
motions of the planets; Galileo's outspoken support of the Copernican
theory led to him being tried and condemned by the Inquisition.[145]
 Galileo Galilei, discoverer of
the four largest moons of
Jupiter, now known as
 Galilean moons 
During the 1660s, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini"] Giovanni Cassini used a new telescope to discover
spots and colourful bands in Jupiter's atmosphere, observe that the planet
appeared oblate, and estimate its rotation period.[146] In 1692, Cassini
noticed that the atmosphere undergoes differential rotation.[147]
 The Great Red Spot may have been observed as early as 1664 by Robert
Hooke and in 1665 by Cassini, although this is disputed. The pharmacist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Heinrich_Schwabe"] Heinrich Schwabe produced the
earliest known drawing to show details of the Great Red Spot in 1831.[148] The Red Spot was reportedly
lost from sight on several occasions between 1665 and 1708 before becoming quite conspicuous in
1878.[149] It was recorded as fading again in 1883 and at the start of the 20th century.[150]
Both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Alfonso_Borelli"] Giovanni Borelli and Cassini made careful tables of the motions of Jupiter's moons, which allowed
predictions of when the moons would pass before or behind the planet. By the 1670s, Cassini observed that
when Jupiter was on the opposite side of the Sun from Earth, these events would occur about 17 minutes
later than expected. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_R%C3%B8mer"] Ole Rømer deduced that light does not travel instantaneously (a conclusion that Cassini
had earlier rejected),[49] and this timing discrepancy was used to estimate the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light"] speed of light.[151][152]
 In 1892, E. E. Barnard observed a fifth satellite of Jupiter with the 36-inch (910 mm) refractor at Lick
Observatory in California. This moon was later named Amalthea.[153] It was the last planetary moon to be
discovered directly by a visual observer through a telescope.[154] An additional eight satellites were
discovered before the flyby of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1"] Voyager 1 probe in 1979.[e]
In 1932, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Wildt"] Rupert Wildt identified [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_bands"] absorption bands of ammonia and methane in the spectra of Jupiter.[155]
Three long-lived anticyclonic features called "white ovals" were observed in 1938. For several decades
they remained as separate features in the atmosphere, sometimes approaching each other but never merging.
Finally, two of the ovals merged in 1998, then absorbed the third in 2000, becoming [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_BA"] Oval BA.[156]
Radiotelescope research
In 1955, Bernard Burke and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Franklin"] Kenneth Franklin discovered that Jupiter emits bursts of radio waves at a
frequency of 22.2 MHz.[64]: 36  The period of these bursts matched the rotation of the planet, and they used
this information to determine a more precise value for Jupiter's rotation rate. Radio bursts from Jupiter were
found to come in two forms: long bursts (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short bursts (or S-
Page 12
bursts) lasting less than a hundredth of a second.[157]
Scientists have discovered three forms of radio signals transmitted
from Jupiter:
Decametric radio bursts (with a wavelength of tens of
metres) vary with the rotation of Jupiter, and are
influenced by the interaction of Io with Jupiter's magnetic
field.[158]
Decimetric radio emission (with wavelengths measured
in centimetres) was first observed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Drake"] Frank Drake and
Hein Hvatum in 1959.[64]: 36  The origin of this signal is a
torus-shaped belt around Jupiter's equator, which
generates [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclotron_radiation"] cyclotron radiation from electrons that are
accelerated in Jupiter's magnetic field.[159]
Thermal radiation is produced by heat in the atmosphere
of Jupiter.[64]: 43

Exploration
Jupiter has been visited by automated spacecraft since 1973, when the space probe [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_10"] Pioneer 10 passed close
enough to Jupiter to send back revelations about its properties and phenomena.[160][161] Missions to Jupiter
are accomplished at a cost in energy, which is described by the net change in velocity of the spacecraft, or
 delta-v. Entering a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit"] Hohmann transfer orbit from Earth to Jupiter from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit"] low Earth orbit requires a delta-v of
 6.3 km/s,[162] which is comparable to the 9.7 km/s delta-v needed to reach low Earth orbit.[163] Gravity
assists through planetary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_slingshot"] flybys can be used to reduce the energy required to reach Jupiter.[164]
Flyby missions
Beginning in 1973, several spacecraft have
performed planetary flyby manoeuvres that
brought them within observation range of Jupiter.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_program"] Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up
images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its
moons. They discovered that the radiation fields
near the planet were much stronger than expected,
but both spacecraft managed to survive in that
environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft
were used to refine the mass estimates of the
Jovian system. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_occultations"] Radio occultations by the planet
resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's
diameter and the amount of  polar
flattening.[55]: 47 [166]

Six years later, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_program"] Voyager missions vastly improved the understanding of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moon"] Galilean moons and
discovered Jupiter's rings. They also confirmed that the Great Red Spot was anticyclonic. Comparison of
images showed that the Spot had changed hue since the Pioneer missions, turning from orange to dark
brown. A torus of ionized atoms was discovered along Io's orbital path, which were found to come from
erupting volcanoes on the moon's surface. As the spacecraft passed behind the planet, it observed flashes of
lightning in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(solar)"] night side atmosphere.[55]: 87 [167]
Page 13
The next mission to encounter Jupiter was the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(spacecraft)"] Ulysses solar probe. In February 1992, it performed a flyby
manoeuvre to attain a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_orbit"] polar orbit around the Sun. During this pass, the spacecraft studied Jupiter's
magnetosphere, although it had no cameras to photograph the planet. The spacecraft passed by Jupiter six
years later, this time at a much greater distance.[165]
In 2000, the Cassini probe flew by Jupiter on its way to Saturn, and provided higher-resolution
images.[168]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons"] New Horizons probe flew by Jupiter in 2007 for a gravity assist en route to Pluto.[169] The probe's
cameras measured plasma output from volcanoes on Io and studied all four Galilean moons in detail.[170]
Galileo mission 
The first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter was the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_spacecraft"] Galileo mission, which reached
the planet on December 7, 1995.[60] It remained in orbit for over seven
years, conducting multiple flybys of all the Galilean moons and Amalthea.
The spacecraft also witnessed the impact of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9"] Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9
when it collided with Jupiter in 1994. Some of the goals for the mission
were thwarted due to a malfunction in Galileo's high-gain antenna.[171]
A 340-kilogram titanium [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_(spacecraft)#Galileo_entry_probe"] atmospheric probe was released from the
spacecraft in July 1995, entering Jupiter's atmosphere on December 7.[60] It
parachuted through 150 km (93 mi) of the atmosphere at a speed of about
2,575 km/h (1600 mph)[60] and collected data for 57.6 minutes until the
Jupiter as seen by the
space probe [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens"] Cassini 
spacecraft was destroyed.[172] The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more
rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the
planet on September 21, 2003. NASA destroyed the spacecraft in order to
avoid any possibility of the spacecraft crashing into and possibly
contaminating the moon Europa, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Europa"] which may harbour life.[171]
Data from this mission revealed that hydrogen composes up to 90% of Jupiter's atmosphere.[60] The
recorded temperature was more than 300 °C (570 °F) and the windspeed measured more than 644 km/h
(>400 mph) before the probes vaporized.[60]
Juno mission
NASA's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)"] Juno mission arrived at
Jupiter on July 4, 2016 with the
goal of studying the planet in
detail from a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_orbit"] polar orbit. The
spacecraft was originally
intended to orbit Jupiter thirty-
seven times over a period of
twenty months.[173][19][174]
During the mission, the
spacecraft will be exposed to
high levels of radiation from 
A photograph of Jupiter taken by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(spacecraft)"] Juno spacecraft, at the end of a close
flyby
(September 2018)
 Jupiter's magnetosphere, which
may cause future failure of certain instruments.[175] On August 27, 2016, the spacecraft completed its first
fly-by of Jupiter and sent back the first ever images of Jupiter's north pole.[176]
Page 14
Juno completed 12 orbits before the end of its budgeted mission
plan, ending July 2018.[177] In June of that year, NASA extended
the mission operations plan to July 2021, and in January of that
year the mission was extended to September 2025 with four lunar
flybys: one of Ganymede, one of Europa, and two of Io.[178][179]
When Juno reaches the end of the mission, it will perform a
controlled deorbit and disintegrate into Jupiter's atmosphere. This
will avoid the risk of collision with Jupiter's moons.[180][181]
Cancelled missions and future plans
There is great interest in missions to study Jupiter's larger icy
moons, which may have subsurface liquid oceans. Funding
difficulties have delayed progress, causing NASA's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Icy_Moons_Orbiter"] JIMO (Jupiter
Icy Moons Orbiter) to be cancelled in 2005.[182] A subsequent 
Jupiter, as seen by the Juno
spacecraft
(February 12, 2019)
proposal was developed for a joint NASA/[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESA"] ESA mission called
 EJSM/Laplace, with a provisional launch date around 2020. EJSM/Laplace would have consisted of the

formally ended the partnership in April 2011, citing budget issues at NASA and the consequences on the
mission timetable. Instead, ESA planned to go ahead with a European-only mission to compete in its L1
 Cosmic Vision selection.[184] These plans have been realized as the European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy
Moon Explorer (JUICE), due to launch in 2023,[185] followed by NASA's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_Clipper"] Europa Clipper mission,
scheduled for launch in 2024.[186]
Other proposed missions include the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_National_Space_Administration"] Chinese National Space Administration's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gan_De_(spacecraft)"] Gan De mission which aims
 to launch an orbiter to the Jovian system and possibly Callisto around 2035,[187] and CNSA's Interstellar
Express[188] and NASA's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(space_probe)"] Interstellar,[189] which would both use Jupiter's gravity to help them reach the
edges of the heliosphere.
Moons
Jupiter has 80 known [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite"] natural satellites.[6][190] Of these, 60 are less than 10 km in diameter.[191] The four
largest moons are Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, collectively known as the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons"] Galilean moons", and
are visible from Earth with binoculars on a clear night.[192]
Galilean moons
The moons discovered by Galileo—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—are among the largest in the
Solar System. The orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede form a pattern known as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_resonance"] Laplace resonance; for
every four orbits that Io makes around Jupiter, Europa makes exactly two orbits and Ganymede makes
exactly one. This resonance causes the gravitational effects of the three large moons to distort their orbits
into elliptical shapes, because each moon receives an extra tug from its neighbours at the same point in
every orbit it makes. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force"] tidal force from Jupiter, on the other hand, works to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_circularization"] circularise their orbits.[193]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity"] eccentricity of their orbits causes regular flexing of the three moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity
stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they
swing away. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction"] friction created by this tidal flexing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_acceleration#Tidal_heating"] generates heat in the interior of the moons.[194] This is
Page 15
seen most dramatically in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(moon)#Volcanism"] volcanic activity of Io (which is subject to the strongest tidal forces),[194] and
to a lesser degree in the geological youth of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)#Surface_features"] Europa's surface, which indicates recent resurfacing of the
moon's exterior.[195]

Classification
 Jupiter's moons were traditionally classified into four groups of four, based on their similar orbital
elements.[196] This picture has been complicated by the discovery of numerous small outer moons since
1999. Jupiter's moons are currently divided into several different groups, although there are several moons
which are not part of any group.[197]
The eight innermost [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_moon"] regular moons, which have nearly circular orbits near the plane of Jupiter's equator, are
thought to have formed alongside Jupiter, whilst the remainder are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_moons"] irregular moons and are thought to be
 captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids. The irregular moons within each group may have a
common origin, perhaps as a larger moon or captured body that broke up.[198][199]

Regular moons
The inner group of four small moons all have diameters of less than 200 km, orbit at radii
less than 200,000 km, and have orbital inclinations of less than half a degree.
These four moons, discovered by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei"] Galileo Galilei and by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Marius"] Simon Marius in parallel, orbit
between 400,000 and 2,000,000 km, and are some of the largest moons in the Solar
System. 
Irregular moons
A tightly clustered group of moons with orbits around 11,000,000–12,000,000 km from
Jupiter.[201]
This [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"] retrograde orbit group has rather indistinct borders, averaging 21,276,000 km from
Jupiter with an average inclination of 149 degrees.[199]
A fairly distinct retrograde group that averages 23,404,000 km from Jupiter with an average
inclination of 165 degrees.[199]
A dispersed and only vaguely distinct retrograde group that covers all the outermost
moons.[202]
Planetary rings
Jupiter has a faint [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_ring"] planetary ring system composed of three main
segments: an inner [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus"] torus of particles known as the halo, a relatively
bright main ring, and an outer gossamer ring.[203] These rings
appear to be made of dust, while Saturn's rings are made of
ice.[64]: 65  The main ring is most likely made out of material ejected
from the satellites [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrastea_(moon)"] Adrastea and Metis, which is drawn into Jupiter
because of the planet's strong gravitational influence. New material
is added by additional impacts.[204] In a similar way, the moons
 Thebe and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalthea_(moon)"] Amalthea are believed to produce the two distinct
components of the dusty gossamer ring.[204] There is evidence of a
fourth ring that may consist of collisional debris from Amalthea that
is strung along the same moon's orbit.[205] 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Jupiter"] rings of Jupiter
Interaction with the Solar System
As the most massive of the eight planets, the gravitational influence of
Jupiter has helped shape the Solar System. With the exception of Mercury,
the orbits of the system's planets lie closer to Jupiter's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_plane_(astronomy)"] orbital plane than the
Sun's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_equator"] equatorial plane. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirkwood_gap"] Kirkwood gaps in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt"] asteroid belt are mostly
caused by Jupiter,[206] and the planet may have been responsible for the
 Late Heavy Bombardment in the inner Solar System's history.[207]
In addition to its moons, Jupiter's gravitational field controls numerous
 asteroids that have settled around the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point"] Lagrangian points that precede and
 follow the planet in its orbit around the Sun. These are known as the Trojan
asteroids, and are divided into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Trojan_asteroids_(Greek_camp)"] Greek and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Trojan_asteroids_(Trojan_camp)"] Trojan "camps" to honour the
 Iliad. The first of these, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/588_Achilles"] 588 Achilles, was discovered by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wolf"] Max Wolf in
1906; since then more than two thousand have been discovered.[208] The
largest is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/624_Hektor"] 624 Hektor.[209]

asteroids in Jupiter's orbit,

Page 17
 The Jupiter family is defined as comets that have a semi-major axis smaller than Jupiter's; most short-period
comets belong to this group. Members of the Jupiter family are thought to form in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt"] Kuiper belt outside
the orbit of Neptune. During close encounters with Jupiter, they are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy)"] perturbed into orbits with a smaller
period, which then becomes circularised by regular gravitational interaction with the Sun and Jupiter.[210]
Impacts
Jupiter has been called the Solar System's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9#Jupiter_as_a_%22cosmic_vacuum_cleaner%22"] vacuum cleaner[212] because of
its immense [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_well"] gravity well and location near the inner Solar System. There
are more [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jupiter_events"] impacts on Jupiter, such as comets, than on any other planet in the
Solar System.[213] For example, Jupiter experiences about 200 times more
 asteroid and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet"] comet impacts than Earth.[60] In the past, scientists believed
that Jupiter partially shielded the inner system from cometary
bombardment.[60] However, computer simulations in 2008 suggest that
Jupiter does not cause a net decrease in the number of comets that pass
through the inner Solar System, as its gravity perturbs their orbits inward
roughly as often as it [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_(astrophysics)"] accretes or ejects them.[214] This topic remains
controversial among scientists, as some think it draws comets towards Earth
from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt"] Kuiper belt, while others believes that Jupiter protects Earth from
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud"] Oort cloud.[215] 
Hubble image taken on July
23, 2009, showing a blemish

In July 1994, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Shoemaker%E2%80%93Levy_9"] Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 comet collided with Jupiter.[216][217] The impacts were
closely observed by observatories around the world, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope"] Hubble Space Telescope and Galileo
spacecraft.[218][219][220][221] The event was widely covered by the media.[222]
Surveys of early astronomical records and drawings produced eight examples of potential impact
observations between 1664 and 1839. However, a 1997 review determined that these observations had little
or no possibility of being the results of impacts. Further investigation by this team revealed a dark surface
feature discovered by astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini"] Giovanni Cassini in 1690 may have been an impact scar.[223]
In culture
The planet Jupiter has been known since ancient times. It is visible
to the naked eye in the night sky and can occasionally be seen in
the daytime when the Sun is low.[224] To the Babylonians, this
planet represented their god Marduk,[225] chief of their pantheon
from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammurabi"] Hammurabi period.[226] They used Jupiter's roughly 12-
year orbit along the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic"] ecliptic to define the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constellation"] constellations of their
zodiac.[225]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology"] mythical Greek name for this planet is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus"] Zeus (Ζεύς),  also Jupiter, woodcut from a 1550 edition
referred to as Dias (Δίας), the planetary name of which is retained
in modern Greek.[227] The ancient Greeks knew the planet as 
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_Bonatti"] Guido Bonatti's Liber Astronomiae
 Phaethon (Φαέθων),  meaning "shining one" or "blazing
star".[228][229] The Greek myths of Zeus from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer"] Homeric period showed particular similarities to certain
 Near-Eastern gods, including the Semitic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_(deity)"] El and Baal, the Sumerian Enlil, and the Babylonian god
Marduk.[230] The association between the planet and the Greek deity Zeus was drawn from Near Eastern
influences and was fully established by the fourth century BCE, as documented in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinomis"] Epinomis of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato"] Plato
and his contemporaries.[231]
Page 18
 The god Jupiter is the Roman counterpart of Zeus, and he is the principal god of Roman
mythology. The Romans originally called Jupiter the "star of Jupiter" (Iuppiter Stella)," as
 they believed it to be sacred to its namesake god. This name comes from the Proto-Indo-
European [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocative"] vocative compound *Dyēu-pəter (nominative: *Dyēus-pətēr, meaning "Father
Sky-God", or "Father Day-God").[232] As the supreme god of the Roman pantheon, Jupiter
was the god of thunder, lightning, and storms, and appropriately called the god of light and sky.
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyotisha"] Vedic astrology, Hindu astrologers named the planet after Brihaspati, the religious teacher of the gods,
and often called it "Guru", which literally means the "Heavy One".[233] In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_mythology"] Central Asian Turkic myths,
Jupiter is called Erendiz or Erentüz, from eren (of uncertain meaning) and yultuz ("star"). The Turks
calculated the period of the orbit of Jupiter as 11 years and 300 days. They believed that some social and
natural events connected to Erentüz's movements 
木 星 on the sky.[234] The Chinese, Vietnamese, Koreans, and
 Japanese called it the "wood star" (Chinese: ; pinyin: mùxīng),  based on the Chinese Five
Elements.[235][236][237] In China it became known as the "Year-star" (Sui-sing) as Chinese astronomers
noted that it jumped one [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_zodiac"] zodiac constellation each year (with corrections). In some ancient Chinese writings
the years were named, at least in principle, in correlation with the Jovian zodiacal signs.[238]
