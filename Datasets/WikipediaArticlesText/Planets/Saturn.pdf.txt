Saturn
Saturn is the sixth [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet"] planet from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"] Sun and the second-largest
in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System"] Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant"] gas giant with an
average radius of about nine and a half times that of
Earth.[23][24] It has only one-eighth the average density of
Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times
more massive.[25][26][27] 
Saturn
 Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–
nickel and rock ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon"] silicon and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"] oxygen compounds). Its core is
surrounded by a deep layer of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_hydrogen"] metallic hydrogen, an
intermediate layer of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_hydrogen"] liquid hydrogen and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_helium"] liquid helium, and
finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due
 to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical
current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise
to Saturn's planetary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field"] magnetic field, which is weaker than
Earth's, but which has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment"] magnetic moment 580 times that of
Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field
strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's.[28] The outer
 atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although
long-lived features can appear. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_speed"] Wind speeds on Saturn can
reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter
but not as high as on Neptune.[29]
The planet's most notable feature is its prominent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn"] ring system,
which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller
amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 83 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Saturn"] moons[30] are
known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this
does not include the hundreds of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlet"] moonlets in its rings. Titan,
Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in the Solar
System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less
massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a
substantial atmosphere.[31]

Name and symbol
The symbol for Saturn in late
Classical (4th & 5th c.) and medieval
Byzantine (11th c.) manuscripts,
derives from ⟨κρ⟩ (kappa-rho).[32]
Saturn is named after the Roman [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(mythology)"] god of wealth and agriculture
and father of Jupiter. Its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_symbol"] astronomical symbol (  ) has been
traced back to the Greek [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyrhynchus_Papyri"] Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be
seen to be a Greek kappa-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho"] rho with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribal_abbreviation#Forms"] horizontal stroke, as an
abbreviation for Κρονος (Cronus),  the Greek name for the
planet.[32]It later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta,
with the cross added at the top in the 16th century to
Christianize this pagan symbol.
The Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday,
Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day"), for the planet Saturn.[33]
Physical characteristics
Composite image comparing the
sizes of Saturn and Earth
Saturn is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant"] gas giant composed predominantly of hydrogen and
helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it is likely to have a
solid core.[34] Saturn's rotation causes it to have the shape of an
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblate_spheroid"] oblate spheroid; that is, it is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattening"] flattened at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_pole"] poles and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_bulge"] bulges at
its equator. Its equatorial and polar radii differ by almost 10%:
60,268 km versus 54,364 km.[11] Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune,
the other giant planets in the Solar System, are also oblate but to
a lesser extent. The combination of the bulge and rotation rate
means that the effective surface gravity along the equator,
8.96 m/s2, is 74% of what it is at the poles and is lower than the
 surface gravity of Earth. However, the equatorial escape
velocity of nearly 36 km/s is much higher than that of Earth.[35]
Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense
than water—about 30% less.[36] Although Saturn's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_core"] core is
considerably denser than water, the average [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_density"] specific density of

Diagram of Saturn, to scale 
Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass is not in the
 gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_solution"] non-ideal liquid when the density is above
0.01 g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The
temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the
deeper layers.[38]
Standard planetary models suggest that the interior of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded
by hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of various volatiles.[39] Analysis of the distortion shows that Saturn is
substantially more centrally condensed than [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter"] Jupiter and therefore contains a significantly larger amount of material denser than
 hydrogen near its centre. Saturn’s central regions contain about 50% hydrogen by mass, while Jupiter’s contain approximately
67% hydrogen.[40]
This core is similar in composition to Earth, but is more dense. The examination of Saturn's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_moment"] gravitational moment, in
combination with physical models of the interior, has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn's core. In 2004,
scientists estimated that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of Earth,[41][42] which corresponds to a diameter of about
25,000 km.[43] However, measurements of Saturn's rings suggest a much more diffuse core with a mass equal to about 17
Earths and a radius equal to around 60% of Saturn's entire radius.[44] This is surrounded by a thicker liquid [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_hydrogen"] metallic hydrogen
layer, followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_hydrogen"] molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing
altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000 km and consists of gas.[45][46][47]
Saturn has a hot interior, reaching 11,700 °C at its core, and radiates 2.5 times more energy into space than it receives from the
Sun. Jupiter's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_energy"] thermal energy is generated by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin%E2%80%93Helmholtz_mechanism"] Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism of slow [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_compression"] gravitational compression, but such a
process alone may not be sufficient to explain heat production for Saturn, because it is less massive. An alternative or
additional mechanism may be generation of heat through the "raining out" of droplets of helium deep in Saturn's interior. As
the droplets descend through the lower-density hydrogen, the process releases heat by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction"] friction and leaves Saturn's outer layers
depleted of helium.[48][49] These descending droplets may have accumulated into a helium shell surrounding the core.[39]
Rainfalls of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond"] diamonds have been suggested to occur within Saturn, as well as in Jupiter[50] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_giant"] ice giants Uranus and
Neptune.[51]
Atmosphere
 Methane bands circle Saturn. The
moon Dione hangs below the rings to
the right. 
The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25%
helium by volume.[52] The proportion of helium is significantly deficient compared to
the abundance of this element in the Sun.[39] The quantity of elements heavier than
helium (metallicity) is not known precisely, but the proportions are assumed to match
the primordial abundances from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_of_The_Solar_System"] formation of the Solar System. The total mass of
these heavier elements is estimated to be 19–31 times the mass of the Earth, with a
significant fraction located in Saturn's core region.[53]
Trace amounts of ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, phosphine, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane"] methane have
been detected in Saturn's atmosphere.[54][55][56] The upper clouds are composed of
 ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium
hydrosulfide (NH4SH) or water.[57] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_radiation"] Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane
 photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading to a series of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon"] hydrocarbon chemical
reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddies"] eddies and diffusion.
This [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochemical_cycle"] photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.[56]

Cloud layers 
Saturn's atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands
are much fainter and are much wider near the equator. The nomenclature used to
describe these bands is the same as on Jupiter. Saturn's finer cloud patterns were not
observed until the flybys of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Space_Probe"] Voyager spacecraft during the 1980s. Since then,
Earth-based [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope"] telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be
made.[58]
A global storm girdles the planet in
2011. The storm passes around the
planet, such that the storm's head
(bright area) passes its tail. 
The composition of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure. In the upper
cloud layers, with the temperature in the range 100–160 K and pressures extending
between 0.5–2 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia ice. Water [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cloud"] ice clouds begin at a
level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where
temperatures range from 185 to 270 K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium
hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3–6 bar with temperatures of 190–235 K.
Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10 and 20 bar and temperatures
are 270–330 K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous
solution.[59]
Saturn's usually bland atmosphere occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals and other features common on Jupiter. In 1990, the
 Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn's equator that was not present during the Voyager
encounters, and in 1994 another smaller storm was observed. The 1990 storm was an example of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_Spot"] Great White Spot, a unique
but short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years, around the time of the
northern hemisphere's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice"] summer solstice.[60] Previous Great White Spots were observed in 1876, 1903, 1933 and 1960, with the
1933 storm being the most famous. If the periodicity is maintained, another storm will occur in about 2020.[61]
The winds on Saturn are the second fastest among the Solar System's planets, after Neptune's. Voyager data indicate peak
easterly winds of 500 m/s (1,800 km/h).[62] In images from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens"] Cassini spacecraft during 2007, Saturn's northern hemisphere
displayed a bright blue hue, similar to Uranus. The color was most likely caused by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering"] Rayleigh scattering.[63] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermography"] Thermography has
shown that Saturn's south pole has a warm [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_vortex"] polar vortex, the only known example of such a phenomenon in the Solar
System.[64] Whereas temperatures on Saturn are normally −185 °C, temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as −122 °C,
suspected to be the warmest spot on Saturn.[64]
North pole hexagonal cloud pattern
A persisting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagon"] hexagonal
wave pattern around the
north polar vortex in the
atmosphere at about 78°N
was first noted in the
Voyager images.[65][66][67]
The sides of the hexagon
are each about 14,500 km
(9,000 mi) long, which is
longer than the diameter of
the Earth.[68] The entire
structure rotates with a
period of 10h 39m 24s (the
same period as that of the
planet's  radio emissions)
which is assumed to be 
Saturn's north pole ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"] IR animation) Saturn's south pole
equal to the period of
rotation of Saturn's interior.[69] The hexagonal feature does not shift in longitude like the other clouds in the visible
atmosphere.[70] The pattern's origin is a matter of much speculation. Most scientists think it is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave"] standing wave pattern in the
atmosphere. Polygonal shapes have been replicated in the laboratory through differential rotation of fluids.[71][72]
South pole vortex
Page 5
 HST imaging of the south polar region indicates the presence of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_stream"] jet stream, but no strong polar vortex nor any hexagonal
standing wave.[73] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA"] NASA reported in November 2006 that Cassini had observed a "hurricane-like" storm locked to the south
pole that had a clearly defined eyewall.[74][75] Eyewall clouds had not previously been seen on any planet other than Earth.
For example, images from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_(spacecraft)"] Galileo spacecraft did not show an eyewall in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot"] Great Red Spot of Jupiter.[76]
The south pole storm may have been present for billions of years.[77] This vortex is comparable to the size of Earth, and it has
winds of 550 km/h.[77]
Other features
Cassini observed a series of cloud features found in northern latitudes, nicknamed the "String of Pearls". These features are
cloud clearings that reside in deeper cloud layers.[78]

Radio emissions detected by Cassini
Saturn has an intrinsic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field"] magnetic field that has a simple, symmetric shape—a magnetic dipole. Its strength at the equator—
0.2 gauss ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtesla"] µT)—is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth's magnetic
field.[28] As a result, Saturn's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere"] magnetosphere is much smaller than Jupiter's.[80] When [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_2"] Voyager 2 entered the magnetosphere,
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"] solar wind pressure was high and the magnetosphere extended only 19 Saturn radii, or 1.1 million km (712,000 mi),[81]
although it enlarged within several hours, and remained so for about three days.[82] Most probably, the magnetic field is
generated similarly to that of Jupiter—by currents in the liquid metallic-hydrogen layer called a metallic-hydrogen dynamo.[80]
This magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"] solar wind particles from the Sun. The moon Titan orbits within the outer part
of Saturn's magnetosphere and contributes plasma from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion"] ionized particles in Titan's outer atmosphere.[28] Saturn's
magnetosphere, like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field"] Earth's, produces aurorae.[83]
Orbit and rotation
Saturn and rings as viewed by the
Cassini spacecraft (28 October 2016) 
The average distance between Saturn and the Sun is over 1.4 billion kilometers
(9 AU). With an average orbital speed of 9.68 km/s,[11] it takes Saturn 10,759 Earth
days (or about 291⁄2 years)[84] to finish one revolution around the Sun.[11] As a
consequence, it forms a near 5:2 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean-motion_resonance"] mean-motion resonance with Jupiter.[85] The elliptical
orbit of Saturn is inclined 2.48° relative to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_plane_(astronomy)"] orbital plane of the Earth.[11] The
 perihelion and aphelion distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957 AU, on
average.[11][86] The visible features on Saturn rotate at different rates depending on
latitude, and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions (as in
Jupiter's case).
Astronomers use three different systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn.
System I has a period of 10h 14m 00s (844.3°/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone,
the South Equatorial Belt, and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are
considered to have rotation rates similar to System  I. All other Saturnian latitudes,
excluding the north and south polar regions, are indicated as System II and have been
Page 6
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_astronomy"] assigned a rotation period of 10h 38m 25.4s (810.76°/d). System III refers to Saturn's internal rotation rate. Based on radio
emissions from the planet detected by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1"] Voyager 1 and Voyager 2,[87] System III has a rotation period of 10h 39m 22.4s
(810.8°/d). System III has largely superseded System II.[88]
A precise value for the rotation period of the interior remains elusive. While approaching Saturn in 2004, Cassini found that
the radio rotation period of Saturn had increased appreciably, to approximately 10h 45m 45s  ± 36s.[89][90] An estimate of
Saturn's rotation (as an indicated rotation rate for Saturn as a whole) based on a compilation of various measurements from the
Cassini,  Voyager and Pioneer probes is 10h 32m 35s.[91] Studies of the planet's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#C_Ring"] C Ring yield a rotation period of
10h 33m 38s +

 .[15][16]
In March 2007, it was found that the variation of radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This
variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this
activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of
the planet.[92][93][94]
An apparent oddity for Saturn is that it does not have any known [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_asteroid"] trojan asteroids. These are minor planets that orbit the Sun at
the stable [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point"] Lagrangian points, designated L4 and L5, located at 60° angles to the planet along its orbit. Trojan asteroids have
been discovered for Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance"] Orbital resonance mechanisms, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_resonance"] secular resonance, are
believed to be the cause of the missing Saturnian trojans.[95]
Natural satellites
Saturn has 83 known moons, 53 of which have formal names.[10] In addition, there is
evidence of dozens to hundreds of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlet"] moonlets with diameters of 40–500 meters in
Saturn's rings,[96] which are not considered to be true moons. Titan, the largest moon,
comprises more than 90% of the mass in orbit around Saturn, including the rings.[97]
Saturn's second-largest moon, Rhea, may have a tenuous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Rhea"] ring system of its own,[98]
along with a tenuous atmosphere.[99][100][101]
Many of the other moons are small: 34 are less
than 10 km in diameter and another 14
between 10 and 50 km in diameter.[102]
Traditionally, most of Saturn's moons have

Titan is the only satellite in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System"] Solar System
with a major atmosphere,[103][104] in which a
complex [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_chemistry"] organic chemistry occurs. It is the
only satellite with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakes_of_Titan"] hydrocarbon lakes.[105][106]

On 6 June 2013, scientists at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_de_Astrof%C3%ADsica_de_Andaluc%C3%ADa"] IAA-CSIC
reported the detection of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbons"] polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_atmosphere"] upper atmosphere of
Titan, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAH_world_hypothesis"] possible precursor for life.[107] On 23 June 2014, NASA claimed to have
strong evidence that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"] nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the
 Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in
earlier times.[108]
Saturn's moon Enceladus, which seems similar in chemical makeup to comets,[109] has often been regarded as a potential
 habitat for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism"] microbial life.[110][111][112][113] Evidence of this possibility includes the satellite's salt-rich particles having an
"ocean-like" composition that indicates most of Enceladus's expelled [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice"] ice comes from the evaporation of liquid salt
water.[114][115][116] A 2015 flyby by Cassini through a plume on Enceladus found most of the ingredients to sustain life forms
that live by methanogenesis.[117]
In April 2014, NASA scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon within the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#A_Ring"] A Ring, which was imaged by
Cassini on 15 April 2013.[118]
Planetary rings
Page 7
Saturn is probably best known for the system of
 planetary rings that makes it visually unique.[46]
The rings extend from 6,630 to 120,700 kilometers
(4,120 to 75,000 mi) outward from Saturn's equator
and average approximately 20 meters (66 ft) in
thickness. They are composed predominantly of
water ice, with trace amounts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tholin"] tholin impurities
and a peppered coating of approximately 7%
amorphous carbon.[119] The particles that make up
the rings range in size from specks of dust up to
10 m.[120] While the other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant"] gas giants also have ring
systems, Saturn's is the largest and most visible. 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn"] rings of Saturn (imaged here by
 Cassini in 2007) are the most
massive and conspicuous in the
Solar System.[46] 
False-color [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UV"] UV image of Saturn's
outer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#B_Ring"] B and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#A_Ring"] A rings; dirtier ringlets in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#Cassini_Division"] Cassini Division and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#Encke_Gap"] Encke Gap
show up red.
There are two main hypotheses regarding the origin
of the rings. One hypothesis is that the rings are
remnants of a destroyed moon of Saturn. The
second hypothesis is that the rings are left over from the original [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula"] nebular material from which Saturn was formed. Some ice in
the E ring comes from the moon Enceladus's geysers.[121][122][123][124] The water abundance of the rings varies radially, with
the outermost ring A being the most pure in ice water. This abundance variance may be explained by meteor
bombardment.[125]
Beyond the main rings, at a distance of 12 million km from the planet is the sparse Phoebe ring. It is tilted at an angle of 27° to
the other rings and, like Phoebe, orbits in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_motion"] retrograde fashion.[126]
Some of the moons of Saturn, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora_(moon)"] Pandora and Prometheus, act as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherd_moon"] shepherd moons to confine the rings and prevent
them from spreading out.[127] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(moon)"] Pan and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(moon)"] Atlas cause weak, linear density waves in Saturn's rings that have yielded more reliable
calculations of their masses.[128]
History of observation and exploration
The observation and exploration of Saturn can be divided into three phases. The first phase is ancient observations (such as
with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_eye"] naked eye), before the invention of modern telescopes. The second phase began in the 17th century, with telescopic
observations from Earth, which improved over time. The third phase is visitation by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe"] space probes, in orbit or on flyby. In the
 21st century, telescopic observations continue from Earth (including Earth-orbiting observatories like the Hubble Space
Telescope) and, until [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini_retirement"] its 2017 retirement, from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens"] Cassini orbiter around Saturn.
Ancient observations
Saturn has been known since prehistoric times,[129] and in early recorded history it was a
major character in various mythologies. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy"] Babylonian astronomers systematically observed and
recorded the movements of Saturn.[130] In ancient Greek, the planet was known as Φαίνων
 Phainon,[131] and in Roman times it was known as the "star of Saturn".[132] In ancient
Roman mythology, the planet Phainon was sacred to this agricultural god, from which the
planet takes its modern name.[133] The Romans considered the god Saturnus the equivalent
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology"] Greek god Cronus; in modern Greek, the planet retains the name Cronus—Κρόνος:
Kronos.[134]
The Greek scientist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy"] Ptolemy based his calculations of Saturn's orbit on observations he made
while it was in opposition.[135] In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyotisha"] Hindu astrology, there are nine astrological objects, known
as Navagrahas. Saturn is known as "Shani" and judges everyone based on the good and bad
deeds performed in life.[133
土星][135] Ancient [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_astrology"] Chinese and Japanese culture designated the planet
Saturn as the "earth star" (  ). This was based on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_elements_(Chinese_philosophy)"] Five Elements which were traditionally
used to classify natural elements.[136][137][138] 
 Galileo Galilei observed the
rings of Saturn in 1610, but
was unable to determine what
they were
In ancient Hebrew, Saturn is called Shabbathai.[139] Its angel is Cassiel. Its intelligence or
beneficial spirit is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agiel"] 'Agȋȇl (Hebrew: ‎אגיאל, romanized:  ʿAgyal),[140] and its darker spirit (demon) is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazel_(spirit)"] Zȃzȇl (Hebrew: ‎זאזל,
romanized: Zazl).[140][141][142] Zazel has been described as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel"] great angel, invoked in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon#Angels_and_magic"] Solomonic magic, who is "effective in
 love conjurations".[143][144] In Ottoman Turkish, Urdu, and Malay, the name of Zazel is 'Zuhal', derived from the Arabic
language (Arabic: ‎زحل, romanized: Zuhal).[141]

European observations (17th–19th centuries)
Saturn's rings require at least a 15-mm-diameter [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope"] telescope[145] to resolve and thus were
not known to exist until [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens"] Christiaan Huygens saw them in 1655 and published about
this in 1659. Galileo, with his primitive telescope in 1610,[146][147] incorrectly thought
of Saturn's appearing not quite round as two moons on Saturn's sides.[148][149] It was
not until Huygens used greater telescopic magnification that this notion was refuted,
and the rings were truly seen for the first time. Huygens also discovered Saturn's moon
Titan; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Domenico_Cassini"] Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four other moons: Iapetus, Rhea,
 Tethys and Dione. In 1675, Cassini discovered the gap now known as the Cassini
Division.[150]
No further discoveries of significance were made until 1789 when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel"] William Herschel
discovered two further moons, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimas_(moon)"] Mimas and Enceladus. The irregularly shaped satellite
Hyperion, which has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance"] resonance with Titan, was discovered in 1848 by a British
team.[151] 
 Robert Hooke noted the shadows (a
and b) cast by both the globe and
the rings on each other in this
drawing of Saturn in 1666.
In 1899 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Pickering"] William Henry Pickering discovered Phoebe, a highly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irregular_satellite"] irregular satellite that does not rotate synchronously with Saturn
as the larger moons do.[151] Phoebe was the first such satellite found and it takes more than a year to orbit Saturn in a
 retrograde orbit. During the early 20th century, research on Titan led to the confirmation in 1944 that it had a thick atmosphere
– a feature unique among the Solar System's moons.[152]
Modern NASA and ESA probes
Pioneer 11 flyby
 Pioneer 11 made the first flyby of Saturn in September 1979, when it passed within
20,000 km of the planet's cloud tops. Images were taken of the planet and a few of its
moons, although their resolution was too low to discern surface detail. The spacecraft
also studied Saturn's rings, revealing the thin F-ring and the fact that dark gaps in the
rings are bright when viewed at high [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_angle_(astronomy)"] phase angle (towards the Sun), meaning that they
contain fine light-scattering material. In addition, Pioneer 11 measured the temperature
of Titan.[153] 
Pioneer 11 image of Saturn
Voyager flybys
In November 1980, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1"] Voyager 1 probe visited the Saturn system. It sent back the first high-resolution images of the planet, its
rings and satellites. Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time. Voyager 1 performed a close flyby of Titan,
increasing knowledge of the atmosphere of the moon. It proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_wavelength"] visible wavelengths;
therefore no surface details were seen. The flyby changed the spacecraft's trajectory out from the plane of the Solar
System.[154]
Almost a year later, in August 1981, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_2"] Voyager 2 continued the study of the Saturn system. More close-up images of Saturn's
moons were acquired, as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings. Unfortunately, during the flyby, the
probe's turnable camera platform stuck for a couple of days and some planned imaging was lost. Saturn's gravity was used to
direct the spacecraft's trajectory towards Uranus.[154]
The probes discovered and confirmed several new satellites orbiting near or within the planet's rings, as well as the small
 Maxwell Gap (a gap within the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Saturn#C_Ring"] C Ring) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeler_gap"] Keeler gap (a 42 km-wide gap in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Ring"] A Ring).
Cassini–Huygens spacecraft
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens"] Cassini–Huygens [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_probe"] space probe entered orbit around Saturn on 1 July 2004. In June 2004, it conducted a close flyby of
Phoebe, sending back high-resolution images and data. Cassini's flyby of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, captured radar images
of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands and mountains. The orbiter completed two Titan flybys before
releasing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huygens_probe"] Huygens probe on 25 December 2004. Huygens descended onto the surface of Titan on 14 January 2005.[155]
Page 9
Starting in early 2005, scientists used Cassini to track lightning on Saturn. The power of the lightning is approximately
1,000 times that of lightning on Earth.[156]
In 2006, NASA reported that Cassini had found evidence of liquid water reservoirs no
more than tens of meters below the surface that erupt in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geyser"] geysers on Saturn's moon
Enceladus. These jets of icy particles are emitted into orbit around Saturn from vents in
the moon's south polar region.[158] Over 100 geysers have been identified on
Enceladus.[157] In May 2011, NASA scientists reported that Enceladus "is emerging
as the most habitable spot beyond Earth in the Solar System for life as we know
it".[159][160]
Cassini photographs have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring, outside
the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and E rings. The source of this ring
is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_(moon)"] Janus and Epimetheus.[161] In 
At Enceladus's south pole geysers
spray water from many locations
along the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_stripes_(Enceladus)"] tiger stripes.[157]
July 2006, images were returned of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan's north pole, the
presence of which were confirmed in January 2007. In March 2007, hydrocarbon seas
were found near the North pole, the largest of which is almost the size of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea"] Caspian Sea.[162] In October 2006, the probe
detected an 8,000 km diameter cyclone-like storm with an eyewall at Saturn's south pole.[163]
From 2004 to 2 November 2009, the probe discovered and confirmed eight new satellites.[164] In April 2013 Cassini sent
back images of a hurricane at the planet's north pole 20 times larger than those found on Earth, with winds faster than
530 km/h (330 mph).[165] On 15 September 2017, the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft performed the "Grand Finale" of its
mission: a number of passes through gaps between Saturn and Saturn's inner rings.[166][167] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry"] atmospheric entry of Cassini
ended the mission.
Possible future missions
 The continued exploration of Saturn is still considered to be a viable option for NASA as part of their ongoing New Frontiers
 program of missions. NASA previously requested for plans to be put forward for a mission to Saturn that included the Saturn
Atmospheric Entry Probe, and possible investigations into the habitability and possible discovery of life on Saturn's moons
Titan and Enceladus by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonfly_(spacecraft)"] Dragonfly.[168][169]
Observation
Saturn is the most distant of the five planets easily visible to the naked eye from Earth,
 the other four being Mercury, Venus, Mars and Jupiter. (Uranus, and occasionally 4
Vesta, are visible to the naked eye in dark skies.) Saturn appears to the naked eye in
the night sky as a bright, yellowish point of light. The mean [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"] apparent magnitude of
Saturn is 0.46 with a standard deviation of 0.34.[19] Most of the magnitude variation is
due to the inclination of the ring system relative to the Sun and Earth. The brightest
magnitude, −0.55, occurs near in time to when the plane of the rings is inclined most
highly, and the faintest magnitude, 1.17, occurs around the time when they are least
inclined.[19] It takes approximately 29.5 years for the planet to complete an entire 
Amateur telescopic view of Saturn
circuit of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic"] ecliptic against the background constellations of the zodiac. Most people
will require an optical aid (very large binoculars or a small telescope) that magnifies at least 30 times to achieve an image of
Saturn's rings in which clear resolution is present.[46][145] When Earth passes through the ring plane, which occurs twice every
Saturnian year (roughly every 15 Earth years), the rings briefly disappear from view because they are so thin. Such a
"disappearance" will next occur in 2025, but Saturn will be too close to the Sun for observations.[170]
Saturn and its rings are best seen when the planet is at, or near, opposition, the configuration of a planet when it is at an
 elongation of 180°, and thus appears opposite the Sun in the sky. A Saturnian opposition occurs every year—approximately
every 378 days—and results in the planet appearing at its brightest. Both the Earth and Saturn orbit the Sun on eccentric orbits,
which means their distances from the Sun vary over time, and therefore so do their distances from each other, hence varying
the brightness of Saturn from one opposition to the next. Saturn also appears brighter when the rings are angled such that they
are more visible. For example, during the opposition of 17 December 2002, Saturn appeared at its brightest due to a favorable
 orientation of its rings relative to the Earth,[171] even though Saturn was closer to the Earth and Sun in late 2003.[171]
From time to time, Saturn is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultation"] occulted by the Moon (that is, the Moon covers up Saturn in the sky). As with all the planets in
the Solar System, occultations of Saturn occur in "seasons". Saturnian occultations will take place monthly for about a 12-
month period, followed by about a five-year period in which no such activity is registered. The Moon's orbit is inclined by
Page 10
Simulated appearance of
Saturn as seen from Earth
(at opposition) during an orbit
of Saturn, 2001–2029 
several degrees relative to Saturn's, so occultations
will only occur when Saturn is near one of the points
in the sky where the two planes intersect (both the
 length of Saturn's year and the 18.6-Earth year nodal
precession period of the Moon's orbit influence the
periodicity).[172] 
Saturn eclipses the Sun, as seen
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens"] Cassini. The rings are visible,
including the F Ring.
