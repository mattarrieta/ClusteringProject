Earth
Earth is the third [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet"] planet from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"] Sun
and the only [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object"] astronomical object known
 to harbor life. While large volumes of
 water can be found throughout the Solar
 System, only Earth sustains liquid
surface water. About 71% of Earth's
surface is made up of the ocean,
dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and
rivers. The remaining 29% of Earth's
surface is land, consisting of continents
and islands. Earth's surface layer is
formed of several slowly moving
 tectonic plates, interacting to produce
mountain ranges, volcanoes, and
earthquakes. Earth's liquid [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_core"] outer core
generates the magnetic field that shapes
Earth's  magnetosphere, deflecting
destructive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"] solar winds.
 Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of
 nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy
is received by tropical regions than polar
regions and is  redistributed by
 atmospheric and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_circulation"] ocean circulation.
 Water vapor is widely present in the
atmosphere and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_formation"] forms clouds that cover
most of the planet. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gases"] Greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"] carbon dioxide
 (CO2) trap a part of the energy from the
Sun close to the surface. A region's
climate is governed by latitude, but also
by elevation and proximity to
moderating oceans. Severe weather,
such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms,
and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and
greatly impacts life.
 Earth is  an ellipsoid with a
circumference of about 40,000 km. It is
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Solar_System_objects_by_size"] densest planet in the Solar System.
Of the four [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_planet"] rocky planets, it is the largest
and most massive. Earth is about eight
 light minutes away from the Sun and
 orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25
 days) to complete one revolution. Earth

 rotates around its own axis in just less
than a day (in about 23 hours and 56
minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted
with respect to the perpendicular to its
orbital plane around the Sun, producing
seasons. Earth is orbited by one
 permanent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite"] natural satellite, the Moon,
which orbits Earth at 380,000 km (1.3
light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as
wide as Earth. The Moon always faces
the Earth with the same side through
 tidal locking and causes tides, stabilizes
 Earth's axis, and gradually slows its
rotation.
Earth formed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Earth"] over 4.5 billion years ago.
 During the first billion years of Earth's
 history, the ocean formed and then life
developed within it. Life spread globally
and began to affect Earth's atmosphere
 and surface, leading to Earth's Great
Oxidation Event two billion years ago.
 Humans emerged 300,000 years ago,
and have reached a population of almost
8 billion today. Humans depend on
Earth's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere"] biosphere and natural resources
 for their survival, but have increasingly
impacted Earth's environment. Today,
humanity's impact on Earth's climate,
soils, waters, and ecosystems is
unsustainable, threatening people's lives
 and causing widespread extinction of
other life.

Etymology
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_English"] modern English word Earth developed, via [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English"] Middle English, from an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English"] Old English noun most often
spelled [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eor%C3%B0e"] eorðe.[26] It has cognates in every [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_languages"] Germanic language, and their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Germanic"] ancestral root has been
reconstructed as [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Proto-Germanic/er%C3%BE%C5%8D"] *erþō. In its earliest attestation, the word eorðe was already being used to translate the
many senses of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language"] Latin [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/terra"] terra and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language"] Greek [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B3%E1%BF%86"] γῆ gē: the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of
the world (including the sea), and the globe itself. As with Roman Terra/Tellūs and Greek Gaia, Earth may
have been a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_goddess"] personified goddess in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_religion_(aboriginal)"] Germanic paganism: late [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology"] Norse mythology included [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6r%C3%B0"] Jörð ('Earth'), a
giantess often given as the mother of Thor.[27]
Historically, earth has been written in lowercase. From [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Middle_English"] early Middle English, its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_article"] definite sense as "the
globe" was expressed as the earth. By [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Modern_English"] Early Modern English, many nouns were capitalized, and the earth
was also written the Earth, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently,
the name is sometimes simply given as Earth, by analogy with the names of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System"] other planets, though earth
and forms with the remain common.[26] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide"] House styles now vary: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_spelling"] Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase
form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes
"Earth" when appearing as a name (for example, "Earth's atmosphere") but writes it in lowercase when
preceded by the (for example, "the atmosphere of the earth"). It almost always appears in lowercase in
colloquial expressions such as "what on earth are you doing?"[28]

Occasionally, the name Terra [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈtɛrə/ is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to
distinguish humanity's inhabited planet from others,[29] while in poetry Tellus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈtɛləs/ has been used to
denote personification of the Earth.[30] Terra is also the name of the planet in some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages"] Romance languages
(languages that evolved from Latin) like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language"] Italian and Portuguese, while in other Romance languages the
word gave rise to names with slightly altered spellings (like the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"] Spanish Tierra and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language"] French Terre). The
Latinate form Gæa or Gaea (English: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈdʒiːə/) of the Greek poetic name [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia"] Gaia (Γαῖα; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek"] Ancient Greek: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Greek"] [ɡâi̯.a]
or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Greek"] [ɡâj.ja]) is rare, though the alternative spelling Gaia has become common due to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis"] Gaia hypothesis, in
which case its pronunciation is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈɡaɪə/ rather than the more classical English [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈɡeɪə/.[31]
There are a number of adjectives for the planet Earth. From Earth itself comes earthly. From the Latin
Terra comes terran [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈtɛrən/,[32] terrestrial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /təˈrɛstriəl/,[33] and (via French) terrene [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /təˈriːn/,[34] and from
the Latin Tellus comes tellurian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /tɛˈlʊəriən/[35] and telluric.[36]
Chronology
Formation
 Planetary disk of a star, the inner
ring has a radius equal to Earth and
the Sun 
The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to
4.5682 
+0.0002
−0.0004 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigaannum"] Ga (billion years) ago.[37] By 4.54 ± 0.04 Ga the
 primordial Earth had formed.[38] The bodies in the Solar System
formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_nebula"] solar nebula
partitions a volume out of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_cloud"] molecular cloud by gravitational
collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumstellar_disk"] circumstellar disk,
and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula
contains gas, ice grains, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_dust"] dust (including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_nuclide"] primordial nuclides).
According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebular_theory"] nebular theory, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetesimal"] planetesimals formed by accretion,
with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere
from 70 to 100 million years to form.[39]
Estimates of the age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly
younger.[40] A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_impact_hypothesis"] leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a
Mars-sized object with about 10% of Earth's mass, named Theia, collided with Earth.[41] It hit Earth with a
glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth.[42][43] Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 Ga,
numerous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event"] asteroid impacts during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment"] Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater
surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.[44]
Geological history
 Earth's atmosphere and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean"] oceans were formed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_activity"] volcanic activity and outgassing.[45] Water vapor from
these sources [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_water_on_Earth"] condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and
comets.[46] Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have been on Earth since it formed.[47] In this model,
atmospheric [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas"] greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faint_young_Sun_paradox"] had only 70% of
its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_luminosity"] current luminosity.[48] By 3.5 Ga, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field"] Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the
atmosphere from being stripped away by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"] solar wind.[49]
As the molten outer layer of Earth cooled it [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition"] formed the first solid crust, which is thought to have been [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafic"] mafic
in composition. The first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust"] continental crust, which was more [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felsic"] felsic in composition, formed by the partial
melting of this mafic crust. The presence of grains of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadean_zircon"] mineral zircon of Hadean age in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eoarchean"] Eoarchean
 sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as 4.4 Ga, only 140 Ma after
Page 5
Earth's formation.[50] There are two main models of
how this initial small volume of continental crust
evolved to reach its current abundance:[51] (1) a
relatively steady growth up to the present day,[52]
which is supported by the radiometric dating of
continental crust globally and (2) an initial rapid
growth in the volume of continental crust during the
Artist's impression of earth during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean"] Archean
eon, showing falling meteor, erupting volcano,
round stromatolites, and barren landscape 
Archean, forming the bulk of the continental crust that
now exists,[53][54] which is supported by isotopic
evidence from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafnium"] hafnium in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zircon"] zircons and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neodymium"] neodymium in
sedimentary rocks. The two models and the data that
support them can be reconciled by large-scale
 recycling of the continental crust, particularly during the early stages of Earth's history.[55]
New continental crust forms as a result of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"] plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss
of heat from Earth's interior. Over [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_time_scale"] the period of hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have caused
areas of continental crust to group together to form [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent"] supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart. At
approximately 750 Ma, one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The
continents later recombined to form [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannotia"] Pannotia at 600–540 Ma, then finally Pangaea, which also began to
break apart at 180 Ma.[56]
The most recent pattern of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_age"] ice ages began about 40 Ma,[57] and then intensified during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene"] Pleistocene
about 3 Ma.[58] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_latitude"] High- and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_latitude"] middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and
thaw, repeating about every 21,000, 41,000 and 100,000 years.[59] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Period"] Last Glacial Period, colloquially
called the "last ice age", covered large parts of the continents, up to the middle latitudes, in ice and ended
about 11,700 years ago.[60]
Origin of life and evolution
 Chemical reactions led to
the first self-replicating
molecules about four
billion years ago. A half
 billion years later, the last
common ancestor of all
current life arose.[61] The
evolution of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis"] photosynthesis
allowed the Sun's energy
to be harvested directly by
life forms. The resultant
 molecular oxygen (O2
)
accumulated in  the
atmosphere and due to
interaction with ultraviolet
solar radiation, formed a
protective [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone_layer"] ozone layer (O3
)
in  the
atmosphere.[62]

hypothesis has been termed "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_Earth"] Snowball Earth", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the
 Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity.[71][72] Following
the Cambrian explosion, 535 Ma, there have been at least five major [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_event"] mass extinctions and many minor
ones.[73][74] Apart from the proposed current [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction"] Holocene extinction event, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event"] most recent was 66 Ma, when
 an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur"] dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but largely
spared small animals such as insects, mammals, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizard"] lizards and birds. Mammalian life has diversified over the
past 66 Mys, and several million years ago an African ape gained the ability to stand upright.[75] This
facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a
larger brain, which led to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolution"] evolution of humans. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_agriculture"] development of agriculture, and then civilization,
led to humans having an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment"] influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to
this day.[76]
Future
Because [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"] carbon dioxide (CO2) has a long lifespan in the atmosphere, moderate human CO2 emissions may
postpone the next glacial inception by 100,000 years.[77]
Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity
will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 billion years by 40%.[78] Earth's increasing surface temperature
will accelerate the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate%E2%80%93silicate_cycle"] inorganic carbon cycle, reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for plants
(10 ppm for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation"] C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100–900 million years.[79][80] The lack of vegetation will
result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.[81] Due to the increased
Page 7
luminosity, Earth's mean temperature may reach 100 °C (212 °F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water
will evaporate and be lost to space, which may trigger a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runaway_greenhouse_effect"] runaway greenhouse effect, within an estimated
1.6 to 3 billion years.[82] Even if the Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will
descend to the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.[82][83]
The Sun will [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution"] evolve to become a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant"] red giant in about 5 billion years. Models predict that the Sun will expand
to roughly 1 AU (150 million km; 93 million mi), about 250 times its present radius.[78][84] Earth's fate is
less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will
move to an orbit 1.7 AU (250 million km; 160 million mi) from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum
radius, otherwise, with tidal effects, it may enter the Sun's atmosphere and be vaporized.[78]
Physical characteristics
Size and shape 
The shape of Earth is nearly spherical. There is a small flattening at
the poles and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_bulge"] bulging around the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator"] equator due to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation"] Earth's rotation.[85]
 Therefore, a better approximation of Earth's shape is an oblate
spheroid, whose equatorial diameter is 43 kilometers (27 mi) larger
than the pole-to-pole diameter.[86]
Earth [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_map"] topological map, the area is
redder if it is raised higher in real-life

3,967.1 mi).[90][91][92] 
The average diameter of the reference spheroid is 12,742
kilometers (7,918 mi).  Local [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography"] topography deviates from this
idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are
small compared to Earth's radius: the maximum deviation of only
0.17% is at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench"] Mariana Trench (10,925 meters or 35,843 feet
below local sea level),[87] whereas [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest"] Mount Everest (8,848 meters or
29,029 feet above local sea level) represents a deviation of
0.14%.[n 6][89] The point on the surface farthest from Earth's center

as tides and winds is called the geoid. More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential

topography.[94]
Internal structure
Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical"] chemical or physical
(rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicate_minerals"] silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a
highly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscous"] viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohorovi%C4%8Di%C4%87_discontinuity"] Mohorovičić discontinuity.[97]
The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometers (3.7 mi) under the oceans to 30–50 km (19–
31 mi) for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_mantle"] upper mantle are collectively known as
the lithosphere, which is divided into independently moving tectonic plates.[98]
Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides.
Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and 660 km (250 and 410 mi) below
the surface, spanning a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_zone_(Earth)"] transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an

Chemical composition
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mass"] Earth's mass is approximately 5.97 ×1024 kg (5,970 Yg). It is composed mostly of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"] iron (32.1%), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"] oxygen
(30.1%), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon"] silicon (15.1%), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"] magnesium (13.9%), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur"] sulfur (2.9%), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel"] nickel (1.8%), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium"] calcium (1.5%), and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminum"] aluminum
(1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_segregation"] mass segregation,
the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel
(5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.[101]
The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur, and fluorine are the
important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%. Over 99% of
the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and
soda.[102][101]
Heat
The major heat-producing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"] isotopes within Earth are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium-40"] potassium-40, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium-238"] uranium-238, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium-232"] thorium-232.[103] At
the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000 °C (10,830 °F),[104] and the pressure could reach 360 GPa
(52 million psi).[105] Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that
early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was
much higher. At approximately 3 Gyr, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing
the rates of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_convection"] mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igneous_rock"] igneous rocks
such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komatiite"] komatiites that are rarely formed today.[106][107]
Page 9
Global map of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_flow"] heat flow from Earth's
interior to the surface 
The mean heat loss from Earth is 87 mW m−2, for a global heat loss
of 4.42×1013 W.[108] A portion of the core's thermal energy is
transported toward the crust by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_plume"] mantle plumes, a form of
convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock.
These plumes can produce [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_(geology)"] hotspots and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_basalt"] flood basalts.[109] More of
the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling
associated with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge"] mid-ocean ridges. The final major mode of heat
loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of
which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much
thinner than that of the continents.[110]
Tectonic plates
Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer, the lithosphere, is divided
into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move
relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: at
 convergent boundaries, two plates come together; at divergent
 boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and at transform
boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these
plate boundaries, earthquakes, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanism"] volcanic activity, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orogeny"] mountain-building,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_trench"] oceanic trench formation can occur.[112] The tectonic plates
ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of
the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.[113] 
 Earth's major plates, which are:[111]
   Pacific [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate"] Plate ·
   African [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Plate"] Plate[n 9] ·
As the tectonic plates migrate, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust"] oceanic crust is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction"] subducted under the
leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same
time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries
creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes

recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. Due to this    Indo-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Australian_Plate"] Australian Plate ·
recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than 100 Ma old. The
oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is 
   South [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_American_Plate"] American Plate
estimated to be 200 Ma old.[114][115] By comparison, the oldest
dated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust"] continental crust is 4,030 Ma,[116] although zircons have been found preserved as clasts within
Eoarchean sedimentary rocks that give ages up to 4,400 Ma, indicating that at least some continental crust
existed at that time.[50]
The seven major plates are the Pacific, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Plate"] North American, Eurasian, African, Antarctic, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Australian_Plate"] Indo-Australian, and
 South American. Other notable plates include the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Plate"] Arabian Plate, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Plate"] Caribbean Plate, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_Plate"] Nazca Plate off
the west coast of South America and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotia_Plate"] Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate
fused with the Indian Plate between 50 and 55 Ma. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocos_Plate"] Cocos Plate advancing at a rate of 75 mm/a (3.0 in/year)[117] and the Pacific Plate moving 52–69 mm/a
(2.0–2.7 in/year). At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the South American Plate, progressing
at a typical rate of 10.6 mm/a (0.42 in/year).[118]
Surface
The total [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid#Area"] surface area of Earth is about 510 million km2 (197 million sq mi).[15] Of this, 70.8%,[15] or
361.13 million km2 (139.43 million sq mi), is below sea level and covered by ocean water.[119] Below the
 ocean's surface are much of the continental shelf, mountains, volcanoes,[86] oceanic trenches, submarine
canyons, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_plateau"] oceanic plateaus, abyssal plains, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system. The remaining

29.2%, or 148.94 million km2 (57.51 million sq mi), not covered
by water has [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrain"] terrain that varies greatly from place to place and
consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other
landforms. The elevation of the land surface varies from the low
point of −418 m (−1,371 ft) at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Sea"] Dead Sea, to a maximum altitude
of 8,848 m (29,029 ft) at the top of Mount Everest. The mean
height of land above sea level is about 797 m (2,615 ft).[120]

showing mountains, icebergs, lakes,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud"] clouds 
The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the
igneous rocks [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granite"] granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser
volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean
floors.[121] Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of
sediment that becomes buried and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagenesis"] compacted together. Nearly 75%
of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the
crust.[122] The third form of rock material found on Earth is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphic_rock"] metamorphic rock, which is created from the
transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most
abundant [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicate_mineral"] silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroxene"] pyroxene and
olivine.[123] Common [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonate_mineral"] carbonate minerals include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcite"] calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.[124]
 Erosion and tectonics, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_volcanic_eruptions"] volcanic eruptions, flooding, weathering, glaciation, the growth of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef"] coral reefs, and
 meteorite impacts are among the processes that constantly reshape Earth's surface over geological
time.[125][126] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedosphere"] pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's continental surface and is composed of soil
and subject to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedogenesis"] soil formation processes. The total [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arable_land"] arable land is 10.9% of the land surface, with 1.3% being
permanent cropland.[127][128] Close to 40% of Earth's land surface is used for agriculture, or an estimated
16.7 million km2 (6.4 million sq mi) of cropland and 33.5 million km2 (12.9 million sq mi) of
pastureland.[129]
Gravitational field
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_of_Earth"] gravity of Earth is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration"] acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the distribution of mass within
Earth. Near Earth's surface, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_acceleration"] gravitational acceleration is approximately 9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2). Local differences
in topography, geology, and deeper tectonic structure cause local and broad regional differences in Earth's
gravitational field, known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_anomaly"] gravity anomalies.[130]
Magnetic field
The main part of Earth's magnetic field is generated in the core, the site of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory"] dynamo process that converts
the kinetic energy of thermally and compositionally driven convection into electrical and magnetic field
energy. The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is,
approximately, a dipole. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the
 equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05 ×10−5 T, with a magnetic
dipole moment of 7.79 ×1022 Am2 at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century.[131] The convection
movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes
 secular variation of the main field and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal"] field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every
million years. The most recent reversal occurred approximately 700,000 years ago.[132][133]
The extent of Earth's magnetic field in space defines the magnetosphere. Ions and electrons of the solar
wind are deflected by the magnetosphere; solar wind pressure compresses the dayside of the
magnetosphere, to about 10 Earth radii, and extends the nightside magnetosphere into a long tail.[134]
Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar
Page 11
wind, a supersonic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_shock"] bow shock precedes the dayside magnetosphere
within the solar wind.[135] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_particle"] Charged particles are contained within
the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy
particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth
rotates.[136][137] The ring current is defined by medium-energy
particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths
 that are still dominated by the magnetic field,[138] and the Van
Allen radiation belts are formed by high-energy particles whose
motion is essentially random, but contained in the
magnetosphere.[139][140]
During [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_storm"] magnetic storms and substorms, charged particles can be
deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the
magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere,
where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the
aurora.[141]

Orbit and rotation
Rotation 
Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is
86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI"] SI seconds).[142]
Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during
the 19th century due to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_acceleration"] tidal deceleration, each day varies between
0 and 2 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond"] ms longer than the mean solar day.[143][144]
 Earth's rotation imaged by Deep
Space Climate Observatory, showing
axis tilt 
Earth's rotation period relative to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_star"] fixed stars, called its stellar
 day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems
Service (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time (UT1),
or 23h 56m 4.0989s.[4][n 10] Earth's rotation period relative to the
 precessing or moving mean [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_equinox"] March equinox (when the Sun is at 90°
on the equator), is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (UT1)
(23h 56m 4.0905s).[4] Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar
day by about 8.4 ms.[145]
Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting
satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h =
15'/min. For bodies near the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_equator"] celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the
Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are
approximately the same.[146][147]
Orbit
Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million km (93 million mi) every 365.2564 mean
solar days, or one [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_year"] sidereal year. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the
stars at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours. Due to this
motion, on average it takes 24 hours—a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time"] solar day—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so
that the Sun returns to the meridian. The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.78 km/s (107,200 km/h;
Page 12
66,600 mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance
equal to Earth's diameter, about 12,742 km (7,918 mi),
in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon,
384,000 km (239,000 mi), in about 3.5 hours.[5]
The Moon and Earth orbit a common [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter"] barycenter every
27.32 days relative to the background stars. When
combined with the Earth-Moon system's common orbit
around the Sun, the period of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synodic_month"] synodic month, from
new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days. Viewed from
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_pole"] celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon,
and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. 
Illustration of the Earth, Earth's orbit, the Sun and
the four [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season"] seasons
Viewed from a vantage point above the Sun and
Earth's north poles, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes
are not precisely aligned: Earth's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt"] axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth-Sun
plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth-Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees against the Earth-Sun plane.
 Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar
eclipses.[5][148]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere"] Hill sphere, or the sphere of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity"] gravitational influence, of Earth is about 1.5 million km (930,000 mi) in
radius.[149][n 11] This is the maximum distance at which Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the
more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by
 the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.[149] Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky
Way and orbits about 28,000 light-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year"] years from its center. It is about 20 light-years above the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_plane"] galactic plane in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Arm"] Orion Arm.[150]
Axial tilt and seasons
Earth's axial tilt and its relation to the
 rotation axis and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_plane_(astronomy)"] planes of orbit 
The axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281°[4] with the axis
of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_Poles"] Celestial Poles. Due
to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point
on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the
 seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern
Hemisphere occurring when the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer"] Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun,
and in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere"] Southern Hemisphere when the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Capricorn"] Tropic of Capricorn
faces the Sun. In each instance, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter"] winter occurs simultaneously in the
opposite hemisphere. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and
the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes
cooler and the days shorter.[151] Above the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle"] Arctic Circle and below
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Circle"] Antarctic Circle there is no daylight at all for part of the year,
causing a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_night"] polar night, and this night extends for several months at
the poles themselves. These same latitudes also experience a
 midnight sun, where the sun remains visible all day.[152][153]
By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the solstices—the points in the orbit of
maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when Earth's rotational axis is
aligned with its orbital axis. In the Northern Hemisphere, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_solstice"] winter solstice currently occurs around 21
December; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice"] summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_equinox"] autumnal equinox is
about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and
winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.[154]

The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo
nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6 years.[155] The orientation (rather than the
angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession"] precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800-year
cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_year"] tropical year. Both of
these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge.
The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_motion"] polar motion has multiple, cyclical
components, which collectively are termed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasiperiodic_motion"] quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual component to
this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_wobble"] Chandler wobble. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in
a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.[156]
In modern times, Earth's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion"] perihelion occurs around 3 January, and its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphelion"] aphelion around 4 July. These dates
change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as
 Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth-Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy
reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion.[157][n 12] Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted
toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern
Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year.
This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess
energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.[158]
Earth–Moon system
Moon
 The Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural
satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the
largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet,
although [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon_(moon)"] Charon is larger relative to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet"] dwarf planet
Pluto.[159][160] The natural satellites of other planets are also
referred to as "moons",  after Earth's.[161] The most widely
accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant-impact_hypothesis"] giant-impact hypothesis,
states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet
called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among
other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements
and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's
crust.[42] 
Earth–Moon system seen from Mars
The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes
 tides on Earth.[162] The same effect on the Moon has led to its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking"] tidal locking: its rotation period is the same
as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet.[163] As the
Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase"] lunar phases.[164]
Due to their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38 mm/a
(1.5 in/year). Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about
23 µs/yr—add up to significant changes.[165] During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ediacaran"] Ediacaran period, for example, (approximately
620 Ma) there were 400±7 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.9±0.4 hours.[166]
The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate.
 Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal
interactions with the Moon.[167] Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque"] torques
applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable,
exhibiting large changes over millions of years, as is the case for Mars, though this is disputed.[168][169]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MarsReconnaissanceOrbiter-Views-EarthMoon-20220422.jpg"]
Page 14
Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the
Sun. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_size"] angular size (or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_angle"] solid angle) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is
about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant.[147] This allows total and annular
solar eclipses to occur on Earth.[170]
Asteroids and artificial satellites
Earth's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-orbital_configuration"] co-orbital asteroids population consists of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-satellite"] quasi-satellites,
objects with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_orbit"] horseshoe orbit and trojans. There are at least five
 quasi-satellites, including 469219 Kamoʻoalewa.[171][172] A trojan
asteroid companion, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_TK7"] 2010 TK7
,  is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libration"] librating around the leading
 Lagrange triangular point, L4, in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit"] Earth's orbit around the
Sun.[173][174] The tiny [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-Earth_asteroid"] near-Earth asteroid [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_RH120"] 2006 RH120 makes
close approaches to the Earth–Moon system roughly every twenty
years. During these approaches, it can orbit Earth for brief periods
of time.[175]
As of September 2021, there are 4,550 operational, human-made
 satellites orbiting Earth.[8] There are also inoperative satellites,
including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_1"] Vanguard 1, the oldest satellite currently in orbit, and
over 16,000 pieces of tracked [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris"] space debris.[n 3] Earth's largest
artificial satellite is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station"] International Space Station.[176]

Hydrosphere 
Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but
technically includes all water surfaces in the world,
including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground
waters down to a depth of 2,000 m (6,600 ft). The
 mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35 ×1018 metric
tons or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans
cover an area of 361.8  million  km2
(139.7 million sq mi) with a mean depth of 3,682 m
Water is transported to various parts of the
hydrosphere via the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle"] water cycle 
(12,080 ft),  resulting in an estimated volume of
1.332 billion km3 (320 million cu mi).[177] If all of
Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a
smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean
would be 2.7 to 2.8 km (1.68 to 1.74 mi).[178] About
97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is
 fresh water.[179][180] Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cap"] ice caps and glaciers.[181]
In Earth's coldest regions, snow survives over the summer and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_formation"] changes into ice. This accumulated snow
and ice eventually forms into glaciers, bodies of ice that flow under the influence of their own gravity.
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_glaciers"] Alpine glaciers form in mountainous areas, whereas vast [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_sheets"] ice sheets form over land in polar regions. The
flow of glaciers erodes the surface changing it dramatically, with the formation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U-shaped_valley"] U-shaped valleys and
other landforms.[182] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_ice"] Sea ice in the Arctic covers an area about as big as the United States, although it is
quickly retreating as a consequence of climate change.[183]
Page 15
The average [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salinity"] salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% salt).[184]
Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks.[185] The oceans
are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life
forms.[186] Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large
 heat reservoir.[187] Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such
as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern_Oscillation"] El Niño–Southern Oscillation.[188]
The abundance of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"] water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes it from other planets in the
 Solar System. Solar System planets with considerable atmospheres do partly host atmospheric water vapor,
but they lack surface conditions for stable surface water.[189] Despite some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite"] moons showing signs of large
reservoirs of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_liquid_water"] extraterrestrial liquid water, with possibly even more volume than Earth's ocean, all of them
are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_lakes_and_seas_in_the_Solar_System"] large bodies of water under a kilometers thick frozen surface layer.[190]
Atmosphere
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure"] atmospheric pressure at Earth's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level"] sea level averages 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi),[191] with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_height"] scale height of
about 8.5 km (5.3 mi).[5] A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934%
argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules.[191] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor"] Water vapor content varies
between 0.01% and 4%[191] but averages about 1%.[5] The height of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere"] troposphere varies with latitude,
ranging between 8 km (5 mi) at the poles to 17 km (11 mi) at the equator, with some variation resulting
from weather and seasonal factors.[192]
Earth's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosphere"] biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_evolution#Oxygen_evolution_in_nature"] Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7 Gya,
 forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today.[62] This change enabled the proliferation of
 aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of
atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"] ultraviolet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation"] solar radiation, permitting life on land.[193]
Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases,
causing small [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor"] meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature.[194] This last
phenomenon is known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect"] greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture
 thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon
dioxide, methane, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide"] nitrous oxide, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone"] ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without
this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18 °C (0 °F), in contrast to the current
+15 °C (59 °F),[195] and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.[196]
Weather and climate
Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, gradually becoming thinner and fading into outer space.[197]
Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 km (6.8 mi) of the surface; this
lowest layer is called the troposphere.[198] Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below,
causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air.
The result is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_circulation"] atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal
energy.[199]
The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_winds"] trade winds in the equatorial region below 30°
latitude and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerlies"] westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°.[200] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_heat_content"] Ocean heat content and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_current"] currents
are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation"] thermohaline circulation that distributes
thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.[201]
Page 16
Earth receives 1361 W/m2 of solar irradiance.[202][203] The
amount of solar energy that reaches the Earth's surface decreases
with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches
the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker
columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air
temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4 °C (0.7 °F) per
degree of latitude from the equator.[204] Earth's surface can be
subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately
homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar
regions, these are the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"] tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate"] temperate
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_region"] polar climates.[205] 
 Hurricane Felix seen from low Earth
orbit, September 2007
 Further factors that affect a location's climates are its proximity to
oceans, the oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and topology.[206]
Places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer
winters, due to the fact that oceans can store large amounts of heat.
The wind transports the cold or the heat of the ocean to the
 land.[207] Atmospheric circulation also plays an important role: San
Francisco and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_DC"] Washington DC are both coastal cities at about the
same latitude. San Francisco's climate is significantly more
moderate as the prevailing wind direction is from sea to land.[208]
Finally, temperatures [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapse_rate"] decrease with height causing mountainous
areas to be colder than low-lying areas.[209] 
 Massive clouds above the Mojave
Desert, February 2016
Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere.
When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the
surface as precipitation.[199] Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and
usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting
life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation
patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric
circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls
in each region.[210]
The commonly used [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification"] Köppen climate classification system has five broad groups ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_climate"] humid tropics, arid,
 humid middle latitudes, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_climate"] continental and cold polar),  which are further divided into more specific
subtypes.[200] The Köppen system rates regions based on observed temperature and precipitation.[211]
 Surface air temperature can rise to around 55 °C (131 °F) in hot deserts, such as Death Valley, and can fall
as low as −89 °C (−128 °F) in Antarctica.[212][213]
Upper atmosphere
Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and
thermosphere.[194] Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with
height. Beyond these, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere"] exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields
interact with the solar wind.[214] Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially
shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line"] Kármán line, defined as
100 km (62 mi) above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space"] outer space.[215]
Page 17
Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of
the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they
 can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss
of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"] hydrogen has a low
 molecular mass, it can achieve [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity"] escape velocity more readily, and it
leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases.[216] The
leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's
atmosphere and surface from an initially [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"] reducing state to its current
Top of Earth's blue-tinted
atmosphere, with the Moon at the
background 
oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen,
but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have
been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of
oxygen in the atmosphere.[217] Hence the ability of hydrogen to
escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life
that developed on Earth.[218] In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water
before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of
methane in the upper atmosphere.[219]
Life on Earth
A planet's life forms inhabit ecosystems, whose total forms the
biosphere.[220] The biosphere is divided into a number of biomes,
inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals.[221] On land,
 biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, height
above sea level and humidity. Terrestrial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra"] biomes lying within the
 Arctic or Antarctic Circles, at high altitudes or in extremely arid
areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitudinal_gradients_in_species_diversity"] species diversity
reaches a peak in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_rainforest"] humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes.[222]
Estimates of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_species"] number of species on Earth today vary; most
species have not been described.[223] Over 99% of all [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"] species that
ever lived on Earth are extinct.[224][225] 
 Fungi are one of the kingdoms of life
on Earth.
A planet that can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not originate there. The distance of Earth
from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining
atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.[226] Earth
provides liquid water—an environment where complex [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"] organic molecules can assemble and interact, and
sufficient energy to sustain metabolism.[227] Plants can take up [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient"] nutrients from the atmosphere, soils and
water. These nutrients are constantly recycled between different species.[228]
Extreme weather, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone"] tropical cyclones (including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane"] hurricanes and typhoons), occurs over most of
Earth's surface and has a large impact on life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an
average of 11,800 human deaths per year.[229] Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides,
tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, blizzards, floods, droughts, wildfires, and other calamities and
disasters.[230] Human impact is felt in many areas due to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"] pollution of the air and water, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain"] acid rain, loss of
vegetation (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_degradation"] soil degradation,
 soil depletion and erosion.[231] Human activities release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere which cause
 global warming.[232] This is driving changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, a global rise in
average sea levels, increased risk of drought and wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.[233]
Human geography

Sovereign states of the world 
 Earth's human population passed seven billion in the
early 2010s,[234] and is projected to peak at around ten
billion in the second half of the 21st century.[235] Most
 of the growth is expected to take place in sub-Saharan
Africa.[235] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_density#Human_population_density"] Human population density varies widely
around the world, but a majority live in Asia. By 2050,
68% of the world's population is expected to be living
in urban, rather than rural, areas.[236] The Northern
Hemisphere contains 68% of the world's  land
mass.[237] Partly due to the predominance of land
mass, 90% of humans live in the Northern
Hemisphere.[238]
It is estimated that one-eighth of Earth's surface is suitable for humans to live on—three-quarters of Earth's
surface is covered by oceans, leaving one-quarter as land. Half of that land area is desert (14%),[239] high
mountains (27%),[240] or other unsuitable terrains. Humans have developed diverse [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society"] societies and cultures;
politically, the world has about [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states"] 206 sovereign states.[241] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)"] States claim the planet's entire land surface,
except for parts of Antarctica and a few other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_nullius"] unclaimed areas.[242] Earth has never had a planetwide
government, but the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"] United Nations is the leading worldwide [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_organization"] intergovernmental organization.[243]
The first human to orbit Earth was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Gagarin"] Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961.[244] In total, about 550 people have
visited outer space and reached orbit as of November 2018, and, of these, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_program"] twelve have walked on the
Moon.[245][246] Normally, the only humans in space are those on the International Space Station. The
station's crew, made up of six people, is usually replaced every six months.[247] The farthest that humans
have traveled from Earth is 400,171 km (248,655 mi), achieved during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13"] Apollo 13 mission in 1970.[248]
Natural resources and land use
Earth has resources that have been exploited by
humans.[249] Those termed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-renewable_resource"] non-renewable resources,
such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel"] fossil fuels, are only replenished over
geological timescales.[250] Large deposits of fossil
fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of
coal, petroleum, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas"] natural gas.[251] These deposits
are used by humans both for energy production and as
feedstock for chemical production.[252] Mineral [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore"] ore
bodies have also been formed within the crust through
a process of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore_genesis"] ore genesis, resulting from actions of
magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics.[253] These Earth's land use for human agriculture
 metals and other elements are extracted by mining, a
process which often brings environmental and health damage.[254]
Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, wood,
pharmaceuticals, oxygen, and the recycling of organic waste. The land-based ecosystem depends upon
 topsoil and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends on dissolved nutrients washed down from the
land.[255] In 2019, 39 million km2 (15 million sq mi) of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and
woodlands, 12 million km2 (4.6 million sq mi) was shrub and grassland, 40 million km2 (15 million sq mi)
were used for animal feed production and grazing, and 11 million km2 (4.2 million sq mi) were cultivated
as croplands.[256] Of the 12–14% of ice-free land that is used for croplands, 2 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point"] percentage points were
irrigated in 2015.[257] Humans use [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_material"] building materials to construct shelters.[258]
Page 19
Humans and environment 
Human activities have impacted Earth's environments. Through
activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, humans have been
increasing the amount of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas"] greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,
altering [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_energy_budget"] Earth's energy budget and climate.[260][261] It is estimated
that global temperatures in the year 2020 were 1.2 °C (2.2 °F)
warmer than the preindustrial baseline.[262] This increase in
temperature, known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming"] global warming, has contributed to the
Change in average surface air 
 melting of glaciers, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise"] rising sea levels, increased risk of drought and
wildfires, and migration of species to colder areas.[233]
temperature since the industrial
revolution, plus drivers for that
change. Human activity has caused
increased temperatures, with natural
forces adding some variability.[259] 
The concept of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_boundaries"] planetary boundaries was introduced to quantify
humanity's impact on Earth. Of the nine identified boundaries, five
have been crossed: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss"] Biosphere integrity, climate change, chemical
pollution, destruction of wild habitats and the nitrogen cycle are
thought to have passed the safe threshold.[263][264] As of 2018, no
country meets the basic needs of its population without
transgressing planetary boundaries. It is though possible to provide all basic physical needs globally within
sustainable levels of resource use.[265]
Cultural and historical viewpoint
 Human cultures have developed many views of the planet.[266]
The standard [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_symbols"] astronomical symbol of Earth consists of a cross
 circumscribed by a circle, ,[267] representing the four corners of
the world. (See also [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_symbol"] Earth symbol.) Earth is sometimes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personification"] personified
as a deity. In many cultures it is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_goddess"] mother goddess that is also the
primary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_deity"] fertility deity.[268] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_myth"] Creation myths in many religions
involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities.[268]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis"] Gaia hypothesis, developed in the mid-20th century, compared
Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism
leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of
habitability.[269][270][271] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_first_images_of_Earth_from_space"] Images of Earth taken from space,
particularly during the Apollo program, have been credited with
altering the way that people viewed the planet that they lived on,
called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_effect"] overview effect, emphasizing its beauty, uniqueness and
apparent fragility.[272][273]In particular, this caused a realization of 
 Earthrise, taken in 1968 by William
Anders, an astronaut on board
 Apollo 8
the scope of effects from human activity on Earth's environment.
 Enabled by science, particularly Earth observation,[274] humans have started to take action on
 environmental issues globally,[275] acknowledging the impact of humans and the interconnectedness of
Earth's environments.
Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet.
Initial belief in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth"] flat Earth was gradually displaced in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece"] Ancient Greece by the idea of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_Earth"] spherical Earth,
which was attributed to both the philosophers [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras"] Pythagoras and Parmenides.[276][277] Earth was generally
 believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century, when scientists first concluded that it was a
moving object, one of the planets of the Solar System.[278]
Page 20
It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_age"] Earth's age was at least many millions of
years.[279] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin"] Lord Kelvin used [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics"] thermodynamics to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and
400 million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiometric_dating"] radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for
determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.[280][281]

Notes
1. All astronomical quantities vary, both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_phenomena"] secularly and periodically. The quantities given are the
values at the instant [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J2000.0"] J2000.0 of the secular variation, ignoring all periodic variations.
2. aphelion = a × (1 + e); perihelion = a × (1 – e), where a is the semi-major axis and e is the
eccentricity. The difference between Earth's perihelion and aphelion is 5 million kilometers.

3. As of 4 January 2018, the United States Strategic Command tracked a total of 18,835
artificial objects, mostly debris. See: Anz-Meador, Phillip; Shoots, Debi, eds. (February

4. Earth's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumference"] circumference is almost exactly 40,000 km because the meter was calibrated on this
measurement—more specifically, 1/10-millionth of the distance between the poles and the
equator.
5. Due to natural fluctuations, ambiguities surrounding [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_shelf"] ice shelves, and mapping conventions
for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_datum"] vertical datums, exact values for land and ocean coverage are not meaningful. Based on
 data from the Vector Map and Global Landcover (http://www.landcover.org/) Archived (https://
web.archive.org/web/20150326085837/http://www.landcover.org/) 26 March 2015 at the
 Wayback Machine datasets, extreme values for coverage of lakes and streams are 0.6% and
1.0% of Earth's surface. The ice sheets of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica"] Antarctica and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland"] Greenland are counted as land,
even though much of the rock that supports them lies below sea level.
6. If Earth were shrunk to the size of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billiard_ball"] billiard ball, some areas of Earth such as large mountain
ranges and oceanic trenches would feel like tiny imperfections, whereas much of the planet,
including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Plains"] Great Plains and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyssal_plain"] abyssal plains, would feel smoother.[88]
