Neptune
Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar
 planet from the Sun. In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System"] Solar System, it is the
fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-
massive planet, and the densest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_planet"] giant planet. It is
17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more
massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is
denser and physically smaller than Uranus
because its greater mass causes more
gravitational compression of its atmosphere. It is
 referred to as one of the solar system's two ice
giant planets (the other one being Uranus). 
Neptune
Being composed primarily of gases and liquids,
it has no well-defined "solid surface". The planet
orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an
average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km;
 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god
of the sea and has the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_symbol"] astronomical symbol ,
representing Neptune's trident.[d]
Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is
the only planet in the Solar System found by
 mathematical prediction rather than by empirical
observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of
Uranus led [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Bouvard"] Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that
its orbit was subject to gravitational [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy)"] perturbation
by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death,
the position of Neptune was predicted from his
 observations, independently, by John Couch
Adams and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbain_Le_Verrier"] Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was
subsequently observed with a telescope on
23 September 1846[1] by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Galle"] Johann Galle within a
 degree of the position predicted by Le Verrier. Its
largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly
thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining
13 known [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Neptune"] moons were located telescopically
until the 20th century. The planet's distance from
Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making
it challenging to study with Earth-based
telescopes. Neptune was visited by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_2"] Voyager  2,
when it [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_flyby"] flew by the planet on 25 August 1989;
Voyager  2 remains the only spacecraft to have
visited Neptune.[17][18] The advent of the

 telescopes with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics"] adaptive optics has recently
allowed for additional detailed observations from
afar.
Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is
composed primarily of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"] hydrogen and helium,
along with traces of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon"] hydrocarbons and possibly
nitrogen, though it contains a higher proportion
of "ices" such as water, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia"] ammonia and methane.
However, similar to Uranus, its interior is
primarily composed of ices and rock;[19] Uranus
 and Neptune are normally considered "ice
giants" to emphasise this distinction.[20] Traces
of methane in the outermost regions in part
account for the planet's blue appearance,[21]
though an unknown component is believed to
color Neptune a deeper blue compared to
Uranus.[21]
In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless
atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere
has active and visible weather patterns. For
example, at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in
1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a
 Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red
Spot on Jupiter. More recently, in 2018, a newer
main dark spot and smaller dark spot were
identified and studied.[22] In addition, these
weather patterns are driven by the strongest
sustained winds of any planet in the Solar
System, with recorded wind speeds as high as
2,100 km/h (580 m/s; 1,300 mph).[23] Because
of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's
outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in
the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud
tops approaching 55 K (−218 °C; −361 °F).
Temperatures at the planet's  centre are
approximately 5,400  K  (5,100  °C;
9,300 °F).[24][25] Neptune has a faint and
fragmented [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_ring"] ring system (labelled "arcs"), which
was discovered in 1984, then later confirmed by
Voyager 2.[26]

 fixed stars.[29] 
Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope,
Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613 contain
plotted points that match up with what is now known to have been the
positions of Neptune on those dates. On both occasions, Galileo seems to
have mistaken Neptune for a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_star"] fixed star when it appeared close—in
conjunction—to Jupiter in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_sky"] night sky.[27] Hence, he is not credited with
Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune
was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_retrograde_motion"] retrograde that
day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it
past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly
retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected
with Galileo's small telescope.[28] In 2009, a study suggested that Galileo
was at least aware that the "star" he had observed had moved relative to the
In 1821, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Bouvard"] Alexis Bouvard published astronomical tables of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit"] orbit of Neptune's neighbour Uranus.[30]
Subsequent observations revealed substantial deviations from the tables, leading Bouvard to hypothesise
 that an unknown body was perturbing the orbit through gravitational interaction.[31] In 1843, John Couch
Page 4
 Adams began work on the orbit of Uranus using the data he had. He requested extra data from Sir George
Airy, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomer_Royal"] Astronomer Royal, who supplied it in February 1844. Adams continued to work in 1845–1846
and produced several different estimates of a new planet.[32][33]
In 1845–1846, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbain_Le_Verrier"] Urbain Le Verrier, independently of Adams, developed his
own calculations but aroused no enthusiasm in his compatriots. In
June 1846, upon seeing Le Verrier's first published estimate of the planet's
 longitude and its similarity to Adams's estimate, Airy persuaded James
Challis to search for the planet. Challis vainly scoured the sky throughout
August and September.[31][34] Challis had, in fact, observed Neptune a
year before the planet's subsequent discoverer, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gottfried_Galle"] Johann Gottfried Galle, and
on two occasions, 4 and 12 August 1845. However, his out-of-date star
maps and poor observing techniques meant that he failed to recognise the
observations as such until he carried out later analysis. Challis was full of
remorse but blamed his neglect on his maps and the fact that he was
 Urbain Le Verrier 
distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.[35][31][36]
Meanwhile, Le Verrier sent a letter and urged [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_Observatory"] Berlin Observatory
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Louis_d%27Arrest"] astronomer Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich
d'Arrest, a student at the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of
the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement
characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening of 23 September 1846, the day Galle
received the letter, he discovered Neptune just northeast of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iota_Aquarii"] Iota Aquarii, 1° from the "five degrees east of
Delta Capricorn" position Le Verrier had predicted it to be,[37][38] about 12° from Adams's prediction, and
on the border of Aquarius and Capricornus according to the modern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU_constellation"] IAU constellation boundaries.
In the wake of the discovery, there was a heated nationalistic rivalry between the French and the British
over who deserved credit for the discovery. Eventually, an international consensus emerged that Le Verrier
and Adams deserved joint credit. Since 1966, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Rawlins"] Dennis Rawlins has questioned the credibility of Adams's
claim to co-discovery, and the issue was re-evaluated by historians with the return in 1998 of the "Neptune
papers" (historical documents) to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Observatory,_Greenwich"] Royal Observatory, Greenwich.[39][40]
Naming
Shortly after its discovery, Neptune was referred to simply as "the planet exterior to Uranus" or as
"Le Verrier's planet". The first suggestion for a name came from Galle, who proposed the name [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_(mythology)"] Janus. In
England, Challis put forward the name [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanus"] Oceanus.[41]
Claiming the right to name his discovery, Le Verrier quickly proposed the name Neptune for this new
 planet, though falsely stating that this had been officially approved by the French Bureau des
Longitudes.[42] In October, he sought to name the planet Le Verrier, after himself, and he had loyal support
in this from the observatory director, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Arago"] François Arago. This suggestion met with stiff resistance outside
France.[43] French almanacs quickly reintroduced the name Herschel for Uranus, after that planet's
discoverer Sir William Herschel, and Leverrier for the new planet.[44]
 Struve came out in favour of the name Neptune on 29 December 1846, to the Saint Petersburg Academy of
Sciences.[45] Soon, Neptune became the internationally accepted name. In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_mythology"] Roman mythology, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_(mythology)"] Neptune
was the god of the sea, identified with the Greek Poseidon. The demand for a mythological name seemed
to be in keeping with the nomenclature of the other planets, all of which were named for deities in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology"] Greek
and Roman mythology.[e][46]

A size comparison of Neptune and
Earth
Most languages today use some variant of the name "Neptune" for the planet; indeed, in Chinese,
Vietnamese, Japanese, and Korean, the planet's name was translated as "sea king star" (
海王星).[47][48] In
Mongolian, Neptune is called Dalain van (Далайн ван), reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of
the sea. In modern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"] Greek the planet is called Poseidon (Ποσειδώνας, Poseidonas), the Greek counterpart
of Neptune.[49] In Hebrew, Rahab (‎רהב), from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahab_(Egypt)#Jewish_folklore"] a Biblical sea monster mentioned in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Psalms"] Book of Psalms,
was selected in a vote managed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_the_Hebrew_Language"] Academy of the Hebrew Language in 2009 as the official name for
the planet, even though the existing Latin term Neptun (‎נפטון) is commonly used.[50][51] In Māori, the
planet is called Tangaroa, named after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangaroa"] Māori god of the sea.[52] In Nahuatl, the planet is called
Tlāloccītlalli, named after the rain god Tlāloc.[52] In Thai, Neptune is referred to by its Westernised name
Dao Nepjun (ดาวเนปจูน), but is also called Dao Ketu (ดาวเกตุ, lit. 'star of Ketu'), after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketu_(mythology)"] Ketu ( ेक तु), the
 descending lunar node, who plays a role in Hindu astrology. In Malay, the name Waruna, after the Hindu
god of seas, is attested as far back as the 1970s,[53] but was eventually superseded by the Latinate
equivalents Neptun (in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_language"] Malaysian[54]) or Neptunus (in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language"] Indonesian[55]).
The usual adjectival form is Neptunian. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonce_word"] nonce form Poseidean ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /pəˈsaɪdiən/), from Poseidon, has also
been used,[4] though the usual adjectival form of Poseidon is Poseidonian ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˌpɒsaɪˈdoʊniən/).[56]
From its discovery in 1846 until the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_Pluto"] discovery of Pluto in 1930, Neptune was the farthest-known planet.
When Pluto was discovered, it was considered a planet, and Neptune thus became the second-farthest-
known planet, except for a 20-year period between 1979 and 1999 when Pluto's elliptical orbit brought it
closer than Neptune to the Sun.[57] The discovery of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt"] Kuiper belt in 1992 led many astronomers to
debate whether Pluto should be considered a planet or as part of the Kuiper belt.[58][59] In 2006, the
 International Astronomical Union [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_definition_of_planet"] defined the word "planet" for the first time, reclassifying Pluto as a
"[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet"] dwarf planet" and making Neptune once again the outermost-known planet in the Solar System.[60]
Neptune's mass of 1.0243×1026 kg[6] is intermediate between
Earth and the larger [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giant"] gas giants: it is 17 times that of Earth but just
1/19th that of Jupiter.[f] Its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity"] gravity at 1 bar is 11.15 m/s2, 1.14 times
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_gravity"] surface gravity of Earth,[61] and surpassed only by Jupiter.[62]
Neptune's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator"] equatorial radius of 24,764 km[10] is nearly four times
that of Earth. Neptune, like Uranus, is an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_giant"] ice giant, a subclass of
 giant planet, because they are smaller and have higher
concentrations of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatiles"] volatiles than Jupiter and Saturn.[63] In the search
for exoplanets, Neptune has been used as a metonym: discovered
bodies of similar mass are often referred to as "Neptunes",[64] just
as scientists refer to various extrasolar bodies as "Jupiters".
Neptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5 to 10% of its mass and
extends perhaps 10 to 20% of the way towards the core, where it reaches pressures of about 10 GPa, or
about 100,000 times that of Earth's atmosphere. Increasing concentrations of methane, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia"] ammonia and water
are found in the lower regions of the atmosphere.[24]

The internal structure of Neptune:
1. Upper atmosphere, top
clouds
2. Atmosphere consisting of
hydrogen, helium and
methane gas
3. Mantle consisting of water,
ammonia and methane
ices
4. Core consisting of rock
(silicates and nickel–iron) 
The mantle is equivalent to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in
water, ammonia and methane.[1] As is customary in planetary
science, this mixture is referred to as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatiles"] icy even though it is a hot,
dense fluid. This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is
sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean.[65] The mantle may
consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break
down into a soup of hydrogen and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_ion"] oxygen ions, and deeper down
 superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen
ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice.[66] At a depth of
7,000 km, the conditions may be such that methane decomposes
into diamond crystals that rain downwards like
hailstones.[67][68][69] Scientists also believe that this kind of
diamond rain occurs on Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.[70][68] Very-
 high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory suggest that the top of the mantle may be an ocean of
liquid carbon with floating solid 'diamonds'.[71][72][73]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_core"] core of Neptune is likely composed of iron, nickel and
silicates, with an interior model giving a mass about 1.2 times that
of Earth.[74] The pressure at the centre is 7 Mbar (700 GPa), about
twice as high as that at the centre of Earth, and the temperature may
be 5,400 K.[24][25]
Atmosphere
At high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is 80% [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"] hydrogen and 19%
helium.[24] A trace amount of methane is also present. Prominent
absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm, in
the red and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this
absorption of red light by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_methane"] atmospheric methane is part of what
gives Neptune its blue hue,[75] although Neptune's vivid azure
differs from Uranus's milder cyan. Because Neptune's atmospheric
methane content is similar to that of Uranus, some unknown
atmospheric constituent is thought to contribute to Neptune's
colour.[21] 
Combined colour and near-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"] infrared

Neptune's atmosphere is subdivided into two main regions: the
lower troposphere, where temperature decreases with altitude, and 
of its moons, Proteus, Larissa,
Galatea, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despina_(moon)"] Despina
the stratosphere, where temperature increases with altitude. The
boundary between the two, the tropopause, lies at a pressure of 0.1
bars (10 kPa).[20] The stratosphere then gives way to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere"] thermosphere at a pressure lower than 10−5 to
10−4 bars (1 to 10 Pa).[20] The thermosphere gradually transitions to the exosphere.
Models suggest that Neptune's troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on
altitude. The upper-level clouds lie at pressures below one bar, where the temperature is suitable for
methane to condense. For pressures between one and five bars (100 and 500 kPa), clouds of ammonia and
 hydrogen sulfide are thought to form. Above a pressure of five bars, the clouds may consist of ammonia,
 ammonium sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and water. Deeper clouds of water ice should be found at pressures of
about 50 bars (5.0 MPa), where the temperature reaches 273 K (0 °C). Underneath, clouds of ammonia and
hydrogen sulfide may be found.[76]
Page 7
High-altitude clouds on Neptune have been observed casting
shadows on the opaque cloud deck below. There are also high-
altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant
latitude. These circumferential bands have widths of 50–150 km
and lie about 50–110 km above the cloud deck.[77] These altitudes
are in the layer where weather occurs, the troposphere. Weather
does not occur in the higher stratosphere or thermosphere.
Neptune's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum"] spectra suggest that its lower stratosphere is hazy due to
condensation of products of ultraviolet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolysis"] photolysis of methane, such
as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethane"] ethane and ethyne.[20][24] The stratosphere is also home to trace
amounts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"] carbon monoxide and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide"] hydrogen cyanide.[20][78] The
stratosphere of Neptune is warmer than that of Uranus due to the
elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.[20]
For reasons that remain obscure, the planet's thermosphere is at an
anomalously high temperature of about 750 K.[79][80] The planet is
too far from the Sun for this heat to be generated by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"] ultraviolet
radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric
interaction with ions in the planet's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere"] magnetic field. Other candidates
are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_wave"] gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the atmosphere.
The thermosphere contains traces of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"] carbon dioxide and water,
which may have been deposited from external sources such as
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorite"] meteorites and dust.[76][78]
Magnetosphere 
A time-lapse video of Neptune and

Bands of high-altitude clouds cast
shadows on Neptune's lower cloud

 Neptune resembles Uranus in its magnetosphere, with a magnetic
field strongly tilted relative to its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"] rotational axis at 47° and offset at least 0.55 radius, or about 13,500 km
from the planet's physical centre. Before Voyager 2's arrival at Neptune, it was hypothesised that Uranus's
tilted magnetosphere was the result of its sideways rotation. In comparing the magnetic fields of the two
planets, scientists now think the extreme orientation may be characteristic of flows in the planets' interiors.
This field may be generated by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection"] convective fluid motions in a thin spherical shell of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor"] electrically conducting
liquids (probably a combination of ammonia, methane and water)[76] resulting in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo"] dynamo action.[81]
The dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14 microteslas
(0.14 G).[82] The dipole [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_moment"] magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2 × 1017 T·m3 (14 μT·RN
3, where RN is
the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large
contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupole"] quadrupole moment that may exceed the
 dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole
moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune may
be the result of offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo
generator.[83][84]
Neptune's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_shock"] bow shock, where the magnetosphere begins to slow the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"] solar wind, occurs at a distance of 34.9
times the radius of the planet. The magnetopause, where the pressure of the magnetosphere counterbalances
the solar wind, lies at a distance of 23–26.5 times the radius of Neptune. The tail of the magnetosphere
extends out to at least 72 times the radius of Neptune, and likely much farther.[83]
Climate
Page 8
Neptune's weather is characterised by extremely dynamic storm
systems, with winds reaching speeds of almost 600 m/s
(2,200 km/h; 1,300 mph)—nearly reaching [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_speed"] supersonic flow.[23]
More typically, by tracking the motion of persistent clouds, wind
speeds have been shown to vary from 20 m/s in the easterly
direction to 325 m/s westward.[86] At the cloud tops, the prevailing
winds range in speed from 400 m/s along the equator to 250 m/s at
the poles.[76] Most of the winds on Neptune move in a direction
opposite the planet's rotation.[87] The general pattern of winds
showed prograde rotation at high latitudes vs. retrograde rotation at
lower latitudes. The difference in flow direction is thought to be a
"skin effect" and not due to any deeper atmospheric processes.[20]
At 70° S latitude, a high-speed jet travels at a speed of 300 m/s.[20]
Neptune differs from Uranus in its typical level of meteorological
activity. Voyager 2 observed weather phenomena on Neptune
during its 1989 flyby,[88] but no comparable phenomena on Uranus
during its 1986 fly-by. 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dark_Spot"] Great Dark Spot (top), Scooter
(middle white cloud),[85] and the
 Small Dark Spot (bottom), with
contrast exaggerated.
The abundance of methane, ethane and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene"] acetylene at Neptune's equator is 10–100 times greater than at the
poles. This is interpreted as evidence for upwelling at the equator and subsidence near the poles because
photochemistry cannot account for the distribution without meridional circulation.[20]
In 2007, it was discovered that the upper troposphere of Neptune's south pole was about 10 K warmer than
the rest of its atmosphere, which averages approximately 73 K (−200 °C). The temperature differential is
enough to let methane, which elsewhere is frozen in the troposphere, escape into the stratosphere near the
pole.[89] The relative "hot spot" is due to Neptune's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt"] axial tilt, which has exposed the south pole to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"] Sun
for the last quarter of Neptune's year, or roughly 40 Earth years. As Neptune slowly moves towards the
opposite side of the Sun, the south pole will be darkened and the north pole illuminated, causing the
methane release to shift to the north pole.[90]
Because of seasonal changes, the cloud bands in the southern hemisphere of Neptune have been observed
to increase in size and albedo. This trend was first seen in 1980. The long orbital period of Neptune results
in seasons lasting forty years.[91]
Storms
In 1989, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dark_Spot"] Great Dark Spot, an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticyclone"] anticyclonic storm system spanning 13,000 km × 6,600 km (8,100 mi
× 4,100 mi)[88] was discovered by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA"] NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The storm resembled the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Red_Spot"] Great Red Spot
of Jupiter. Some five years later, on 2 November 1994, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope"] Hubble Space Telescope did not see the Great
Dark Spot on the planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in Neptune's
northern hemisphere.[92]
The Scooter is another storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. This nickname
first arose during the months leading up to the Voyager 2 encounter in 1989, when they were observed
moving at speeds faster than the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dark_Spot"] Great Dark Spot (and images acquired later would subsequently reveal the
presence of clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by Voyager 2).[87] The
 Small Dark Spot is a southern cyclonic storm, the second-most-intense storm observed during the 1989
encounter. It was initially completely dark, but as Voyager 2 approached the planet, a bright core developed
and can be seen in most of the highest-resolution images.[93] More recently, in 2018, a newer main dark
spot and smaller dark spot were identified and studied.[22]
Page 9
Neptune's dark spots are thought to occur in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troposphere"] troposphere at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud
features,[94] so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for
several months, they are thought to be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex"] vortex structures.[77] Often associated with dark spots are brighter,
persistent methane clouds that form around the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause"] tropopause layer.[95] The persistence of companion clouds
shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer visible
as a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through
some other, unknown mechanism.[96]

Internal heating
Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_heating"] internal heating. The
upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure"] atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C).[101] Deeper
inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is
unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from
Page 10
the Sun;[102] whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as
it receives from the Sun.[103] Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun,
and lies over 50% farther from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40%
its amount of sunlight,[20] yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the
fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal
properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be
sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to
simultaneously explain [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus"] Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the
apparent similarity between the two planets.[104]

it completes an orbit on average every 164.79 years, subject to a
variability of around ±0.1 years. The perihelion distance is
29.81 AU; the aphelion distance is 30.33 AU.[g]
Neptune (red arc) completes one
orbit around the Sun (centre) for
every 164.79 orbits of Earth. The
light blue object represents Uranus. 
On 11 July 2011, Neptune completed its first full [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_coordinates_(astronomy)"] barycentric orbit
since its discovery in 1846,[106][107] although it did not appear at
its exact discovery position in the sky, because Earth was in a
different location in its 365.26 day orbit. Because of the motion of
the Sun in relation to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycenter#Barycenter_in_astronomy"] barycentre of the Solar System, on 11 July
Neptune was also not at its exact discovery position in relation to
the Sun; if the more common [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentric"] heliocentric coordinate system is
used, the discovery longitude was reached on 12 July
2011.[11][108][109]
The elliptical orbit of Neptune is inclined 1.77° compared to that of Earth.
The axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32°,[110] which is similar to the tilts of Earth (23°) and Mars (25°). As a
result, Neptune experiences similar seasonal changes to Earth. The long orbital period of Neptune means
that the seasons last for forty Earth years.[91] Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11 hours.[11]
Because its axial tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its day over the course of its long
year is not any more extreme.
Because Neptune is not a solid body, its atmosphere undergoes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_rotation"] differential rotation. The wide equatorial
zone rotates with a period of about 18 hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's
magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar regions where the rotation period is 12 hours.
This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System,[111] and it results in
strong latitudinal wind shear.[77]
Orbital resonances
Neptune's orbit has a profound impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt"] Kuiper belt. The
Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid_belt"] asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's
orbit at 30 AU out to about 55 AU from the Sun.[112] Much in the same way that Jupiter's gravity
dominates the asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity dominates the Kuiper belt. Over the
Page 11
age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became
destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in the its structure.
The region between 40 and 42 AU is an example.[113]
There do exist orbits within these empty regions where objects can
survive for the age of the Solar System. These [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance"] resonances occur
when Neptune's orbital period is a precise fraction of that of the
object, such as 1:2, or 3:4. If, say, an object orbits the Sun once for
every two Neptune orbits, it will only complete half an orbit by the
time Neptune returns to its original position. The most heavily
populated resonance in the Kuiper belt, with over 200 known
objects,[114] is the 2:3 resonance. Objects in this resonance
complete 2 orbits for every 3 of Neptune, and are known as
 plutinos because the largest of the known Kuiper belt objects,
Pluto, is among them.[115] Although Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit
regularly, the 2:3 resonance ensures they can never collide.[116]
The 3:4, 3:5, 4:7 and 2:5 resonances are less populated.[117]

resonances in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt"] Kuiper belt caused

nonresonant [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Kuiper_belt_object"] "classical belt"
(cubewanos), and the 1:2 resonance

Neptune has a number of known [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_(celestial_body)"] trojan objects occupying both the
Sun–Neptune [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#L4_and_L5"] L4 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#L4_and_L5"] L5 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point"] Lagrangian points—gravitationally stable regions leading and trailing Neptune in
its orbit, respectively.[118] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_trojan"] Neptune trojans can be viewed as being in a 1:1 resonance with Neptune. Some
Neptune trojans are remarkably stable in their orbits, and are likely to have formed alongside Neptune
rather than being captured. The first object identified as associated with Neptune's trailing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#L4_and_L5"] L5 Lagrangian
point was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_LC18"] 2008 LC18
.[119] Neptune also has a temporary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-satellite"] quasi-satellite, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(309239)_2007_RW10"] (309239) 2007 RW10
.[120] The
object has been a quasi-satellite of Neptune for about 12,500 years and it will remain in that dynamical state
for another 12,500 years.[120]
Formation and migration
The formation of the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, has proven
difficult to model precisely. Current models suggest that the matter
density in the outer regions of the Solar System was too low to
account for the formation of such large bodies from the traditionally
accepted method of core accretion, and various hypotheses have A simulation showing the outer
been advanced to explain their formation. One is that the ice giants planets and Kuiper belt: a) before
were not formed by core accretion but from instabilities within the Jupiter and Saturn reached a 2:1

resonance; b) after inward scattering
of Kuiper belt objects following the
orbital shift of Neptune; c) after
An alternative concept is that they formed closer to the Sun, where ejection of scattered Kuiper belt
the matter density was higher, and then subsequently [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_migration"] migrated to  bodies by Jupiter
their current orbits after the removal of the gaseous protoplanetary
disc.[121] This hypothesis of migration after formation is favoured,
due to its ability to better explain the occupancy of the populations of small objects observed in the trans-
Neptunian region.[122] The current most widely accepted[123][124][125] explanation of the details of this
hypothesis is known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_model"] Nice model, which explores the effect of a migrating Neptune and the other
giant planets on the structure of the Kuiper belt.
Moons
Page 12
Neptune has 14 known moons.[6][126] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(moon)"] Triton is the largest Neptunian
moon, comprising more than 99.5% of the mass in orbit around Neptune,[h]
and it is the only one massive enough to be spheroidal. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(moon)"] Triton was
discovered by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Lassell"] William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune
itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has
a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_orbit"] retrograde orbit, indicating that it was captured rather than forming in
place; it was probably once a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet"] dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt.[127] It is close
enough to Neptune to be locked into a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_rotation"] synchronous rotation, and it is
slowly spiralling inward because of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_acceleration"] tidal acceleration. It will eventually be
torn apart, in about 3.6 billion years, when it reaches the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit"] Roche limit.[128]
In 1989, Triton was the coldest object that had yet been measured in the
Solar System,[129] with estimated temperatures of 38 K (−235 °C).[130]
Neptune's second-known satellite (by order of discovery), the irregular
moon Nereid, has one of the most eccentric orbits of any satellite in the
Solar System. The eccentricity of 0.7512 gives it an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoapsis"] apoapsis that is seven
times its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periapsis"] periapsis distance from Neptune.[i]

Neptune.[131] Of these, the

notable for being as large as a body

next-farthest out, Larissa, was originally discovered in 1981 when
it had occulted a star. This occultation had been attributed to ring
arcs, but when Voyager 2 observed Neptune in 1989, Larissa was found to have caused it. Five new
irregular moons discovered between 2002 and 2003 were announced in 2004.[133][134] A new moon and
the smallest yet, Hippocamp, was found in 2013 by combining multiple Hubble images.[135] Because
Neptune was the Roman god of the sea, Neptune's moons have been named after lesser sea gods.[46]
Planetary rings
Neptune has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_ring"] planetary ring system, though one much less substantial than that of Saturn. The rings may
consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely gives them a
reddish hue.[136] The three main rings are the narrow Adams Ring, 63,000 km from the centre of Neptune,
the Le Verrier Ring, at 53,000 km, and the broader, fainter Galle Ring, at 42,000 km. A faint outward
extension to the Le Verrier Ring has been named Lassell; it is bounded at its outer edge by the Arago Ring
at 57,000 km.[137]
The first of these planetary rings was detected in 1968 by a team led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Guinan"] Edward Guinan.[26][138] In the
early 1980s, analysis of this data along with newer observations led to the hypothesis that this ring might be
incomplete.[139]Evidence that the rings might have gaps first arose during a stellar [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultation"] occultation in 1984
Page 13
when the rings obscured a star on immersion but not on
emersion.[140] Images from Voyager 2 in 1989 settled the issue by
showing several faint rings.
The outermost ring, Adams, contains five prominent arcs now
named Courage,  Liberté,  Egalité  1,  Egalité  2 and Fraternité
(Courage, Liberty, Equality and Fraternity).[141] The existence of
arcs was difficult to explain because the laws of motion would
predict that arcs would spread out into a uniform ring over short
timescales. Astronomers now estimate that the arcs are corralled
into their current form by the gravitational effects of Galatea, a
moon just inward from the ring.[142][143] 
Neptune's rings
Earth-based observations announced in 2005 appeared to show that
Neptune's rings are much more unstable than previously thought.
Images taken from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._M._Keck_Observatory"] W. M. Keck Observatory in 2002 and 2003 show considerable decay in the rings
when compared to images by Voyager 2. In particular, it seems that the Liberté arc might disappear in as
little as one century.[144]
Observation
Neptune brightened about 10% between 1980 and 2000 mostly due
to the changing of the seasons.[145] Neptune may continue to
 brighten as it approaches perihelion in 2042. The apparent
magnitude currently ranges from 7.67 to 7.89 with a mean of 7.78
and a standard deviation of 0.06.[15] Prior to 1980 the planet was as
faint as magnitude 8.0.[15] Neptune is too faint to be visible to the
 naked eye. It can be outshone by Jupiter's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_moons"] Galilean moons, the
 dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroids 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, 7 Iris, 3
Juno, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_Hebe"] 6 Hebe.[146] A telescope or strong binoculars will
resolve Neptune as a small blue disk, similar in appearance to
Uranus.[147]
Because of the distance of Neptune from Earth, its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter"] angular diameter [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Southern_Observatory"] In 2018, the European Southern
only ranges from 2.2 to 2.4 arcseconds,[6][16] the smallest of the
Solar System planets. Its small apparent size makes it challenging to
study visually. Most telescopic data was fairly limited until the
advent of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope"] Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based 
Observatory developed unique laser-
based methods to get clear and high-
resolution images of Neptune from
the surface of Earth.
telescopes with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics"] adaptive optics (AO).[148][149][150] The first
scientifically useful observation of Neptune from ground-based
telescopes using adaptive optics was commenced in 1997 from Hawaii.[151] Neptune is currently entering
its spring and summer season and has been shown to be heating up, with increased atmospheric activity and
brightness as a consequence. Combined with technological advancements, ground-based telescopes with
adaptive optics are recording increasingly more detailed images of it. Both Hubble and the adaptive-optics
telescopes on Earth have made many new discoveries within the Solar System since the mid-1990s, with a
large increase in the number of known satellites and moons around the outer planet, among others. In 2004
and 2005, five new small satellites of Neptune with diameters between 38 and 61 kilometres were
discovered.[152]
Page 14
From Earth, Neptune goes through [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_retrograde_motion"] apparent retrograde motion every 367 days, resulting in a looping
motion against the background stars during each opposition. These loops carried it close to the 1846
discovery coordinates in April and July 2010 and again in October and November 2011.[109]
Neptune's 164-year orbital period means that the planet takes an average of 13 years to move through each
constellation of the zodiac. In 2011, it completed its first full orbit of the Sun since being discovered and
returned to where it was first spotted northeast of Iota Aquarii.[37]
Observation of Neptune in the radio-frequency band shows that it is a source of both continuous emission
and irregular bursts. Both sources are thought to originate from its rotating magnetic field.[76] In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"] infrared
part of the spectrum, Neptune's storms appear bright against the cooler background, allowing the size and
shape of these features to be readily tracked.[153]
Exploration 
 Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft that has visited Neptune. The
spacecraft's closest approach to the planet occurred on 25 August
1989. Because this was the last major planet the spacecraft could
visit, it was decided to make a close flyby of the moon Triton,
regardless of the consequences to the trajectory, similarly to what
was done for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1"] Voyager 1's encounter with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn"] Saturn and its moon
Titan. The images relayed back to Earth from Voyager 2 became
the basis of a 1989 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS"] PBS all-night program, Neptune All Night.[154]
A Voyager 2 mosaic of Triton
the same day.[155] 
During the encounter, signals from the spacecraft required
246 minutes to reach Earth. Hence, for the most part, Voyager 2's
mission relied on preloaded commands for the Neptune encounter.
The spacecraft performed a near-encounter with the moon [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nereid_(moon)"] Nereid
before it came within 4,400 km of Neptune's atmosphere on 25
August, then passed close to the planet's largest moon [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(moon)"] Triton later
The spacecraft verified the existence of a magnetic field surrounding the planet and discovered that the field
was offset from the centre and tilted in a manner similar to the field around Uranus. Neptune's rotation
period was determined using measurements of radio emissions and Voyager 2 also showed that Neptune
had a surprisingly active weather system. Six new moons were discovered, and the planet was shown to
have more than one ring.[131][155]
The flyby also provided the first accurate measurement of Neptune's mass which was found to be 0.5
percent less than previously calculated. The new figure disproved the hypothesis that an undiscovered
 Planet X acted upon the orbits of Neptune and Uranus.[156][157]
Since 2018, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Space_Administration"] China National Space Administration has been studying a concept for a pair of Voyager-
like interstellar probes tentatively known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_Express"] Interstellar Express or Interstellar Heliosphere Probe.[158]
Both probes will be launched at the same time in 2024 and take differing paths to explore opposing ends of
the heliosphere; the second probe, IHP-2, will fly by Neptune in January 2038, passing only 1,000 km
above the cloud tops, and potentially carry an atmospheric impactor to be released during its approach.[159]
Afterward, it will continue on its mission throughout the Kuiper belt toward the tail of the heliosphere, so
far unexplored.
Page 15
After Voyager 2 and IHP-2's flybys, the next step in scientific exploration of the Neptunian system is
considered to be an orbital mission; most proposals have been by NASA, most often for a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship_Program"] Flagship
orbiter.[160] Such a hypothetical mission is envisioned to be possible in the late 2020s or early 2030s.[160]
However, there have been discussions to launch Neptune missions sooner. In 2003, there was a proposal in
NASA's "Vision Missions Studies" for a "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_Odyssey"] Neptune Orbiter with Probes" mission that does [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens"] Cassini-level
science.[161] Another, more recent proposal was for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argo_(NASA_spacecraft)"] Argo, a flyby spacecraft to be launched in 2019, that
would visit Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt_object"] Kuiper belt object. The focus would be on Neptune and its
largest moon [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triton_(moon)"] Triton to be investigated around 2029.[162] The proposed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons_2"] New Horizons 2 mission (which
was later scrapped) might also have done a close flyby of the Neptunian system. Currently a pending
proposal for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_program"] Discovery program, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_(spacecraft)"] Trident would conduct a flyby of Neptune and Triton;[163] however,
the mission was not selected for Discovery 15 or 16. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_Odyssey"] Neptune Odyssey is the current mission concept for a
Neptune orbiter and atmospheric probe being studied as a possible [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_strategic_science_mission"] large strategic science mission by
NASA that would launch between 2031 and 2033, and arrive at Neptune by 2049.[164]

 Stats of planets in the Solar System
Notes
a. Orbital elements refer to the Neptune barycentre and Solar System barycentre. These are
the instantaneous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osculating_orbit"] osculating values at the precise [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J2000"] J2000 epoch. Barycentre quantities are
given because, in contrast to the planetary centre, they do not experience appreciable
changes on a day-to-day basis from the motion of the moons.
b. Refers to the level of 1 bar (100 kPa) atmospheric pressure
c. Based on the volume within the level of 1 bar atmospheric pressure
d. A second symbol, an ‘LV’ monogram for 'Le Verrier', analogous to the ‘H’ monogram
for Uranus. It was never much used outside of France and is now archaic.
e. One might be tempted to say "except 'Earth'", which in the English language is the name of a
Germanic deity, Erda. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAU"] IAU policy is that one may call the Earth and the Moon by any
 name commonly used in the language being used. Contrary to common use by science
fiction writers, 'Terra' and 'Luna' are not the official names of our planet and its moon. See
the wikipedia article [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"] Earth for references.
f. The mass of Earth is 5.9736 ×1024 kg, giving a mass ratio
The mass of Uranus is 8.6810 ×1025 kg, giving a mass ratio
The mass of Jupiter is 1.8986 ×1027 kg, giving a mass ratio

g. The last three aphelia were 30.33 AU, the next is 30.34 AU. The perihelia are even more
stable at 29.81 AU.[105]
h. Mass of Triton: 2.14 ×1022 kg. Combined mass of 12 other known moons of Neptune:
7.53 ×1019 kg, or 0.35%. The mass of the rings is negligible.
