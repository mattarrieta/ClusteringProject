Uranus
Uranus is the seventh [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet"] planet from the Sun. Its name is a
reference to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_god"] Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who,
according to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology"] Greek mythology, was the great-
grandfather of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares"] Ares (Mars),  grandfather of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus"] Zeus
(Jupiter) and father of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronus"] Cronus (Saturn). It has the third-
largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary
mass in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System"] Solar System. Uranus is similar in
composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical
 compositions which differ from that of the larger gas
giants [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter"] Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists
often classify Uranus and Neptune as "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_giant"] ice giants" to
distinguish them from the other giant planets. 
Uranus (  )
As with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_giants"] gas giants, ice giants also lack a well defined
"solid surface." Uranus's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere#Others"] atmosphere is similar to
Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of
 hydrogen and helium, but it contains more "ices" such
as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of
other hydrocarbons.[17] It has the coldest planetary
atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum
temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a
complex, layered [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud"] cloud structure with water thought to
make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost
layer of clouds.[17] The interior of Uranus is mainly
composed of ices and rock.[16]
Like the other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_planet"] giant planets, Uranus has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings_of_Uranus"] ring system, a
magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian
 system has a unique configuration because its axis of
rotation is tilted sideways, nearly into the plane of its
solar orbit. Its north and south poles, therefore, lie
where most other planets have their equators.[22] In
1986, images from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_2"] Voyager  2 showed Uranus as an
almost featureless planet in visible light, without the
cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant
planets.[22] Voyager  2 remains the only spacecraft to
visit the planet.[23] Observations from Earth have
shown seasonal change and increased weather activity
as Uranus approached its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox"] equinox in 2007. Wind speeds
can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h;
560 mph).[24]

History
Like the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_planet"] classical planets, Uranus is visible to the naked
eye, but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient
observers because of its dimness and slow orbit.[25] Sir
 William Herschel first observed Uranus on 13 March
1781, leading to its discovery as a planet, expanding the
known boundaries of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System"] Solar System for the first time
in history and making Uranus the first planet classified
as such with the aid of a telescope.

Uranus had been observed on many occasions before its
recognition as a planet, but it was generally mistaken for
a star. Possibly the earliest known observation was by
Hipparchos, who in 128 BC might have recorded it as a
star for his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_catalogue"] star catalogue that was later incorporated into
 Ptolemy's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almagest"] Almagest.[26] The earliest definite sighting
was in 1690, when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Flamsteed"] John Flamsteed observed it at least
six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French
astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Charles_Le_Monnier"] Pierre Charles Le Monnier observed Uranus
at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769,[27]
including on four consecutive nights.
Sir [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Herschel"] William Herschel observed Uranus on 13 March
1781 from the garden of his house at 19 New King
 Street in Bath, Somerset, England (now the Herschel
Museum of Astronomy),[28] and initially reported it (on
26 April 1781) as a comet.[29] With a homemade 6.2-
inch reflecting telescope, Herschel "engaged in a series
of observations on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax"] parallax of the fixed
stars."[30][31]
 Herschel recorded in his journal: "In the quartile near ζ
Tauri ...  either [a] Nebulous star or perhaps a
comet."[32] On 17 March he noted: "I looked for the
Comet or Nebulous Star and found that it is a Comet,
for it has changed its place."[33] When he presented his
discovery to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society"] Royal Society, he continued to assert
that he had found a comet, but also implicitly compared
it to a planet:[30]
The power I had on when I first saw the
comet was 227. From experience I know
that the diameters of the fixed stars are not
proportionally magnified with higher
powers, as planets are; therefore I now put
the powers at 460 and 932, and found that
the diameter of the comet increased in
proportion to the power, as it ought to be,
on the supposition of its not being a fixed
star, while the diameters of the stars to
which I compared it were not increased in
the same ratio. Moreover, the comet being
magnified much beyond what its light
would admit of, appeared hazy and ill-
defined with these great powers, while the
stars preserved that lustre and distinctness
which from many thousand observations I
knew they would retain. The sequel has
shown that my surmises were well-
founded, this proving to be the Comet we
have lately observed.[30]

Herschel notified the Astronomer Royal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevil_Maskelyne"] Nevil Maskelyne of his discovery and received this flummoxed
reply from him on 23 April 1781: "I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving
in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any
coma or tail to it."[34]
Although Herschel continued to describe his new object as a comet, other astronomers had already begun
to suspect otherwise. Finnish-Swedish astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Johan_Lexell"] Anders Johan Lexell, working in Russia, was the first to
compute the orbit of the new object.[35] Its nearly circular orbit led him to a conclusion that it was a planet
rather than a comet. Berlin astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Elert_Bode"] Johann Elert Bode described Herschel's discovery as "a moving star
that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet-like object circulating beyond the orbit of Saturn".[36] Bode
concluded that its near-circular orbit was more like a planet's than a comet's.[37]
The object was soon universally accepted as a new planet. By 1783, Herschel acknowledged this to Royal
Society president [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Banks"] Joseph Banks: "By the observation of the most eminent Astronomers in Europe it appears
that the new star, which I had the honour of pointing out to them in March 1781, is a Primary Planet of our
Solar System."[38] In recognition of his achievement, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom"] King George III gave Herschel an annual [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipend"] stipend of
£200 on condition that he move to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor,_Berkshire"] Windsor so that the Royal Family could look through his telescopes
(equivalent to £26,000 in 2021).[39][40]
Name
The name of Uranus references the ancient Greek deity of the sky [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus_(mythology)"] Uranus ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language"] Ancient Greek: [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BF%E1%BD%90%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BD%CF%8C%CF%82#Ancient_Greek"] Οὐρανός), the
father of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronus"] Cronus (Saturn) and grandfather of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus"] Zeus (Jupiter),  which in Latin became Ūranus
 (IPA:  [ˈuːranʊs]).[1] It is the only planet whose English name is derived directly from a figure of Greek
mythology. The adjectival form of Uranus is "Uranian".[41] The pronunciation of the name Uranus
preferred among [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomers"] astronomers is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈjʊərənəs/ [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key"] YOOR-ə-nəs,[2] with stress on the first syllable as in Latin
Ūranus, in contrast to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /jʊˈreɪnəs/ [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key"] yoo-RAY-nəs, with stress on the second syllable and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_length#Traditional_long_and_short_vowels_in_English_orthography"] long a, though
both are considered acceptable.[f]
Consensus on the name was not reached until almost 70 years after the planet's discovery. During the
original discussions following discovery, Maskelyne asked Herschel to "do the astronomical world the
faver [[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic"] sic] to give a name to your planet, which is entirely your own, [and] which we are so much obliged
to you for the discovery of".[43] In response to Maskelyne's request, Herschel decided to name the object
Georgium Sidus (George's Star), or the "Georgian Planet" in honour of his new patron, King George
III.[44] He explained this decision in a letter to Joseph Banks:[38]
In the fabulous ages of ancient times the appellations of Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and
Saturn were given to the Planets, as being the names of their principal heroes and divinities. In
the present more philosophical era it would hardly be allowable to have recourse to the same
method and call it Juno, Pallas, Apollo or Minerva, for a name to our new heavenly body. The
first consideration of any particular event, or remarkable incident, seems to be its chronology:
if in any future age it should be asked, when this last-found Planet was discovered? It would
be a very satisfactory answer to say, 'In the reign of King George the Third'.
Herschel's proposed name was not popular outside Britain, and alternatives were soon proposed.
Astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me_Lalande"] Jérôme Lalande proposed that it be named Herschel in honour of its discoverer.[45] Swedish
astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Prosperin"] Erik Prosperin proposed the name Neptune, which was supported by other astronomers who
Page 5
 liked the idea to commemorate the victories of the British Royal Naval fleet in the course of the American
Revolutionary War by calling the new planet even Neptune George III or Neptune Great Britain.[35]
In a March 1782 treatise, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Elert_Bode"] Bode proposed Uranus, the Latinised version of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology"] Greek god of the sky,
Ouranos.[46] Bode argued that the name should follow the mythology so as not to stand out as different
from the other planets, and that Uranus was an appropriate name as the father of the first generation of the
Titans.[46] He also noted that elegance of the name in that just as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(mythology)"] Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new
planet should be named after the father of Saturn.[40][46][47][48] In 1789, Bode's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences"] Royal Academy colleague
 Martin Klaproth named his newly discovered element [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium"] uranium in support of Bode's choice.[49] Ultimately,
 Bode's suggestion became the most widely used, and became universal in 1850 when HM Nautical
Almanac Office, the final holdout, switched from using Georgium Sidus to Uranus.[47]
 Uranus has two astronomical symbols. The first to be proposed, ,[g] was proposed by Johann Gottfried
Köhler at Bode's request in 1782.[50] Köhler suggested that the new planet be given the symbol for
platinum, which had been described scientifically only 30 years before. As there was no [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemical_symbol"] alchemical symbol
for platinum, he suggested or , a combination of the planetary-metal symbols ☉ (gold) and ♂ (iron), as
platinum (or 'white gold') is found mixed with iron. Bode thought that an upright orientation, ⛢, fit better
with the symbols for the other planets while remaining distinct.[50] This is the symbol that's preferred for
modern astronomical use, the little that any symbol is.[51][52] The second symbol, ,[h] was suggested by
Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as "un globe surmonté par la première lettre
de votre nom" ("a globe surmounted by the first letter of your surname").[45] The second symbol is nearly
universal in astrology.
Uranus is called by a variety of names in other languages. In Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese,
its name is literally translated as the "sky king star" (
天王星).[53][54][55][56] In Thai, its official name is Dao
Yurenat (ดาวยูเรนัส), as in English. Its other name in Thai is Dao Maritayu (ดาวมฤตยู, Star of Mṛtyu),
after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_language"] Sanskrit word for 'death', [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrtyu"] Mrtyu (मृत्यु). In Mongolian, its name is Tengeriin Van (Тэнгэрийн ван),
translated as 'King of the Sky', reflecting its namesake god's role as the ruler of the heavens. In Hawaiian,
its name is Heleʻekala, a loanword for the discoverer Herschel.[57] In Māori, its name is Whērangi.[58][59]
Uranus orbits the Sun once every 84 years, taking an average of seven years to pass through each of the
dozen constellations of the zodiac. In 2033, the planet will have made its third complete orbit around the
 Sun since being discovered in 1781. The planet has returned to the point of its discovery northeast of Zeta
Tauri twice since then, in 1862 and 1943, one day later each time as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_precession"] precession of the equinoxes has
shifted it 1° west every 72 years. Uranus will return to this location again in 2030–31. Its average distance
from the Sun is roughly 20 AU (3 billion km; 2 billion mi). The difference between its minimum and
maximum distance from the Sun is 1.8 AU, larger than that of any other planet, though not as large as that
of dwarf planet Pluto.[60] The intensity of sunlight varies inversely with the square of distance, and so on
Uranus (at about 20 times the distance from the Sun compared to Earth) it is about 1/400 the intensity of
light on Earth.[61]
The orbital elements of Uranus were first calculated in 1783 by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace"] Pierre-Simon Laplace.[62] With time,
discrepancies began to appear between the predicted and observed orbits, and in 1841, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Couch_Adams"] John Couch Adams
 first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet. In 1845, Urbain
 Le Verrier began his own independent research into Uranus's orbit. On 23 September 1846, Johann
Gottfried Galle located a new planet, later named Neptune, at nearly the position predicted by Le
Verrier.[63]

Orbit and rotation
Page 6
The rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17 hours, 14 minutes. As on all the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_planet"] giant planets, its upper
atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation. At some latitudes, such as about 60
degrees south, visible features of the atmosphere move much faster, making a full rotation in as little as 14
hours.[64]
Axial tilt
Simulated Earth view of Uranus from
1986 to 2030, from southern summer
solstice in 1986 to equinox in 2007
and northern summer solstice in
2028. 
The Uranian axis of rotation is approximately parallel with the
plane of the Solar System, with an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt"] axial tilt of 97.77° (as defined by
prograde rotation). This gives it seasonal changes completely unlike
those of the other planets. Near the solstice, one pole faces the Sun
continuously and the other faces away. Only a narrow strip around
the equator experiences a rapid day–night cycle, but with the Sun
low over the horizon. At the other side of Uranus's orbit the
orientation of the poles towards the Sun is reversed. Each pole gets
around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of
darkness.[65] Near the time of the equinoxes, the Sun faces the
equator of Uranus giving a period of day–night cycles similar to
those seen on most of the other planets.
One result of this axis orientation is that, averaged over the Uranian
year, the polar regions of Uranus receive a greater energy input from the Sun than its equatorial regions.
Nevertheless, Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles. The underlying mechanism that causes this is
unknown. The reason for Uranus's unusual axial tilt is also not known with certainty, but the usual
speculation is that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth-sized [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanet"] protoplanet collided with
Uranus, causing the skewed orientation.[66] Research by Jacob Kegerreis of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham_University"] Durham University suggests
that the tilt resulted from a rock larger than the Earth crashing into the planet 3 to 4 billion years ago.[67]
Uranus's south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun at the time of Voyager 2's flyby in 1986. The
 labelling of this pole as "south" uses the definition currently endorsed by the International Astronomical
Union, namely that the north pole of a planet or satellite is the pole that points above the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariable_plane"] invariable plane of
the Solar System, regardless of the direction the planet is spinning.[68][69] A different convention is
sometimes used, in which a body's north and south poles are defined according to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule"] right-hand rule in
relation to the direction of rotation.[70]

Visibility
The mean [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"] apparent magnitude of Uranus is 5.68 with a standard deviation of 0.17, while the extremes are
5.38 and 6.03.[18] This range of brightness is near the limit of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_eye"] naked eye visibility. Much of the variability is
dependent upon the planetary latitudes being illuminated from the Sun and viewed from the Earth.[72] Its
 angular diameter is between 3.4 and 3.7 arcseconds, compared with 16 to 20 arcseconds for Saturn and 32
to 45 arcseconds for Jupiter.[73] At opposition, Uranus is visible to the naked eye in dark skies, and
Page 7
becomes an easy target even in urban conditions with binoculars.[6] In larger amateur telescopes with an
 objective diameter of between 15 and 23 cm, Uranus appears as a pale cyan disk with distinct limb
darkening. With a large telescope of 25 cm or wider, cloud patterns, as well as some of the larger satellites,
such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titania_(moon)"] Titania and Oberon, may be visible.[74]
Physical characteristics
Internal structure
Uranus's mass is roughly 14.5 times that of Earth, making it the
least massive of the giant planets. Its diameter is slightly larger than
Neptune's at roughly four times that of Earth. A resulting density of
1.27 g/cm3 makes Uranus the second least dense planet, after
Saturn.[11][12] This value indicates that it is made primarily of
various ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane.[16] The total
mass of ice in Uranus's interior is not precisely known, because
different figures emerge depending on the model chosen; it must be
between 9.3 and 13.5 Earth masses.[16][75] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"] Hydrogen and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium"] helium
constitute only a small part of the total, with between 0.5 and
1.5 Earth masses.[16] The remainder of the non-ice mass (0.5 to
3.7 Earth masses) is accounted for by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(geology)"] rocky material.[16] 
Size comparison of Earth and
Uranus
The standard model of Uranus's structure is that it consists of three
layers: a rocky (silicate/[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron%E2%80%93nickel_alloy"] iron–nickel) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_(geology)"] core in the centre, an icy
 mantle in the middle and an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium
envelope.[16][76] The core is relatively small, with a mass of only
0.55 Earth masses and a radius less than 20% of Uranus'; the
mantle comprises its bulk, with around 13.4 Earth masses, and the
upper atmosphere is relatively insubstantial, weighing about
0.5 Earth masses and extending for the last 20% of Uranus's
radius.[16][76] Uranus's core [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"] density is around 9 g/cm3,  with a  Diagram of the interior of Uranus
 pressure in the centre of 8 million bars (800 GPa) and a temperature
of about 5000 K.[75][76] The ice mantle is not in fact composed of
ice in the conventional sense, but of a hot and dense fluid consisting of water, ammonia and other
volatiles.[16][76] This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water–ammonia
ocean.[77]
The extreme pressure and temperature deep within Uranus may break up the methane molecules, with the
carbon atoms condensing into crystals of diamond that rain down through the mantle like
hailstones.[78][79][80] Very-high-pressure experiments at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Livermore_National_Laboratory"] Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
suggest that the base of the mantle may comprise an ocean of metallic liquid carbon, perhaps with floating
solid 'diamond-bergs'.[81][82][83] Scientists also believe that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain"] rainfalls of solid [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond"] diamonds occur on Uranus, as
well as on Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune.[84][85]
The bulk compositions of Uranus and Neptune are different from those of Jupiter and Saturn, with ice
dominating over gases, hence justifying their separate classification as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_giant"] ice giants. There may be a layer of
ionic water where the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper
down [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superionic_water"] superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions move freely within the
oxygen lattice.[86]

Although the model considered above is reasonably standard, it is not unique; other models also satisfy
observations. For instance, if substantial amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice
mantle, the total mass of ices in the interior will be lower, and, correspondingly, the total mass of rocks and
hydrogen will be higher. Presently available data does not allow a scientific determination of which model
is correct.[75] The fluid interior structure of Uranus means that it has no solid surface. The gaseous
atmosphere gradually transitions into the internal liquid layers.[16] For the sake of convenience, a revolving
 oblate spheroid set at the point at which atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa) is conditionally
designated as a "surface". It has equatorial and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_pole"] polar radii of 25,559 ± 4 km (15,881.6 ± 2.5 mi) and
24,973 ± 20 km (15,518 ± 12 mi), respectively.[11] This surface is used throughout this article as a zero
point for altitudes.
Internal heat
Uranus's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_heat"] internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it
has a low [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_flux"] thermal flux.[24][87] Why Uranus's internal temperature is so low is still not understood. Neptune,
which is Uranus's near twin in size and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it
receives from the Sun,[24] but Uranus radiates hardly any excess heat at all. The total power radiated by
Uranus in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_infrared"] far infrared (i.e. heat) part of the spectrum is 1.06 ± 0.08 times the solar energy absorbed in
its atmosphere.[17][88] Uranus's heat flux is only 0.042 ± 0.047 W/[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_metre"] m2, which is lower than the internal heat
flux of Earth of about 0.075 W/[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_metre"] m2.[88] The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause"] tropopause is 49 K
(−224.2 °C; −371.5 °F), making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System.[17][88]
One of the hypotheses for this discrepancy suggests that when Uranus was hit by a supermassive impactor,
which caused it to expel most of its primordial heat, it was left with a depleted core temperature.[89] This
impact hypothesis is also used in some attempts to explain the planet's axial tilt. Another hypothesis is that
some form of barrier exists in Uranus's upper layers that prevents the core's heat from reaching the
surface.[16] For example, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection"] convection may take place in a set of compositionally different layers, which may
inhibit the upward [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_conduction"] heat transport;[17][88] perhaps [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_diffusive_convection"] double diffusive convection is a limiting factor.[16]
In a recent study, the ice giants' interior conditions were mimicked by compressing water containing
minerals like olivine and ferropericlase. It showed that much magnesium could be dissolved in the liquid
interiors of Uranus and Neptune. A thermal insulation layer made of dissolved magnesium in Uranus due to
a larger quantity in Uranus than Neptune was proposed as a possible explanation of Uranus's low
temperature.[90]
Atmosphere
Although there is no well-defined solid surface within Uranus's interior, the outermost part of Uranus's
gaseous envelope that is accessible to remote sensing is called its atmosphere.[17] Remote-sensing
capability extends down to roughly 300 km below the 1 bar (100 kPa) level, with a corresponding pressure
around 100 bar (10 MPa) and temperature of 320 K (47 °C; 116 °F).[92] The tenuous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermosphere"] thermosphere extends
over two planetary radii from the nominal surface, which is defined to lie at a pressure of 1 bar.[93] The
Uranian atmosphere can be divided into three layers: the troposphere, between altitudes of −300 and 50 km
(−186 and 31 mi) and pressures from 100 to 0.1 bar (10 MPa to 10 kPa); the stratosphere, spanning
altitudes between 50 and 4,000 km (31 and 2,485 mi) and pressures of between 0.1 and 10−10 bar (10 kPa
to 10 µPa); and the thermosphere extending from 4,000 km to as high as 50,000 km from the surface.[17]
There is no mesosphere.
Composition
Page 9
The composition of Uranus's atmosphere is different from its bulk,
consisting mainly of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_hydrogen"] molecular hydrogen and helium.[17] The
helium [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_composition"] molar fraction, i.e. the number of helium [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom"] atoms per
molecule of gas, is 0.15 ± 0.03[21] in the upper troposphere, which
corresponds to a mass fraction 0.26± 0.05.[17][88] This value is
close to the protosolar helium mass fraction of 0.275± 0.01,[94]
indicating that helium has not settled in its centre as it has in the gas
giants.[17] The third-most-abundant component of Uranus's
atmosphere is methane (CH4).[17] Methane has prominent
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_band"] absorption bands in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum"] visible and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-infrared"] near-infrared (IR),  making
Uranus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquamarine_(color)"] aquamarine or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyan"] cyan in colour.[17] Methane molecules
account for 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction below the
Uranus's atmosphere taken during
the Outer Planet Atmosphere Legacy
(OPAL) program.[91] 
methane cloud deck at the pressure level of 1.3 bar (130 kPa); this
represents about 20 to 30 times the carbon abundance found in the
Sun.[17][20][95] The mixing ratio[i] is much lower in the upper
atmosphere due to its extremely low temperature, which lowers the
saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out.[96] The
abundances of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide"] hydrogen sulfide in the deep
atmosphere are poorly known. They are probably also higher than solar values.[17][97] Along with
methane, trace amounts of various [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon"] hydrocarbons are found in the stratosphere of Uranus, which are thought
to be produced from methane by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolysis"] photolysis induced by the solar [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"] ultraviolet (UV) radiation.[98] They
include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethane"] ethane (C2H6),  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene"] acetylene (C2H2),  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylacetylene"] methylacetylene (CH3C2H),  and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacetylene"] diacetylene
(C2
HC2
H).[96][99][100] Spectroscopy has also uncovered traces of water vapour, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"] carbon monoxide and
 carbon dioxide in the upper atmosphere, which can only originate from an external source such as infalling
dust and comets.[99][100][101]
Troposphere
The troposphere is the lowest and densest part of the atmosphere and is characterised by a decrease in
temperature with altitude.[17] The temperature falls from about 320 K (47 °C; 116 °F) at the base of the
nominal troposphere at −300 km to 53 K (−220 °C; −364 °F) at 50 km.[92][95] The temperatures in the
coldest upper region of the troposphere (the tropopause) actually vary in the range between 49 and 57 K
(−224 and −216 °C; −371 and −357 °F) depending on planetary latitude.[17][87] The tropopause region is
 responsible for the vast majority of Uranus's thermal far infrared emissions, thus determining its effective
temperature of 59.1 ± 0.3 K (−214.1 ± 0.3 °C; −353.3 ± 0.5 °F).[87][88]
The troposphere is thought to have a highly complex cloud structure; water clouds are hypothesised to lie in
the pressure range of 50 to 100 bar (5 to 10 MPa), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_hydrosulfide"] ammonium hydrosulfide clouds in the range of 20 to
40 bar (2 to 4 MPa), ammonia or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide"] hydrogen sulfide clouds at between 3 and 10 bar (0.3 and 1 MPa) and
finally directly detected thin methane clouds at 1 to 2 bar (0.1 to 0.2 MPa).[17][20][92][102] The troposphere
is a dynamic part of the atmosphere, exhibiting strong winds, bright clouds and seasonal changes.[24]
Upper atmosphere
The middle layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the stratosphere, where temperature generally increases with
altitude from 53 K (−220 °C; −364 °F) in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropopause"] tropopause to between 800 and 850 K (527 and 577 °C; 980
and 1,070 °F) at the base of the thermosphere.[93] The heating of the stratosphere is caused by absorption
of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and other hydrocarbons,[104] which form in this part of the
atmosphere as a result of methane photolysis.[98] Heat is also conducted from the hot thermosphere.[104]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet"]
Page 10
The hydrocarbons occupy a relatively narrow layer at altitudes of
between 100 and 300 km corresponding to a pressure range of
1000 to 10 Pa and temperatures of between 75 and 170 K (−198
and −103 °C; −325 and −154 °F).[96][99] The most abundant
hydrocarbons are methane, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylene"] acetylene and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethane"] ethane with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_ratio"] mixing ratios
 of around 10−7 relative to hydrogen. The mixing ratio of carbon
monoxide is similar at these altitudes.[96][99][101] Heavier
hydrocarbons and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"] carbon dioxide have mixing ratios three orders of
magnitude lower.[99] The abundance ratio of water is around
7 ×10−9.[100] Ethane and acetylene tend to condense in the colder
lower part of stratosphere and tropopause (below 10 mBar level)
forming haze layers,[98] which may be partly responsible for the
bland appearance of Uranus. The concentration of hydrocarbons in
the Uranian stratosphere above the haze is significantly lower than
in the stratospheres of the other giant planets.[96][105] 
Aurorae on Uranus taken by the
Space Telescope Imaging
Spectrograph (STIS) installed on
Hubble.[103]
The outermost layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the thermosphere and corona, which has a uniform
temperature around 800 to 850 K.[17][105] The heat sources necessary to sustain such a high level are not
understood, as neither the solar UV nor the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(astronomy)"] auroral activity can provide the necessary energy to maintain
these temperatures. The weak cooling efficiency due to the lack of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere above
0.1 mBar pressure level may contribute too.[93][105] In addition to molecular hydrogen, the thermosphere-
corona contains many free hydrogen atoms. Their small mass and high temperatures explain why the
corona extends as far as 50,000 km (31,000 mi), or two Uranian radii, from its surface.[93][105] This
extended corona is a unique feature of Uranus.[105] Its effects include a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)"] drag on small particles orbiting
Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings.[93] The Uranian thermosphere, together
with the upper part of the stratosphere, corresponds to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionosphere"] ionosphere of Uranus.[95] Observations show
that the ionosphere occupies altitudes from 2,000 to 10,000 km (1,200 to 6,200 mi).[95] The Uranian
ionosphere is denser than that of either Saturn or Neptune, which may arise from the low concentration of
hydrocarbons in the stratosphere.[105][106] The ionosphere is mainly sustained by solar UV radiation and its
density depends on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weather"] solar activity.[107] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auroral"] Auroral activity is insignificant as compared to Jupiter and
Saturn.[105][108]
Magnetosphere 
Before the arrival of Voyager  2,  no measurements of the
Uranian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetosphere"] magnetosphere had been taken, so its nature remained
 a mystery. Before 1986, scientists had expected the magnetic
field of Uranus to be in line with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"] solar wind, because it
would then align with Uranus's poles that lie in the
ecliptic.[109]
The magnetic field of Uranus  Voyager's observations revealed that Uranus's magnetic field is
(animated; 25 March 2020)  peculiar, both because it does not originate from its geometric
centre, and because it is tilted at 59° from the axis of
rotation.[109][110] In fact the magnetic dipole is shifted from
Uranus's centre towards the south rotational pole by as much as one third of the planetary radius.[109] This
unusual geometry results in a highly asymmetric magnetosphere, where the magnetic field strength on the
surface in the southern hemisphere can be as low as 0.1 gauss (10 µT), whereas in the northern hemisphere
it can be as high as 1.1 gauss (110 µT).[109] The average field at the surface is 0.23 gauss (23 µT).[109]
Studies of Voyager 2 data in 2017 suggest that this asymmetry causes Uranus's magnetosphere to connect
Page 11
with the solar wind once a Uranian day, opening the planet to the Sun's particles.[111] In comparison, the
magnetic field of Earth is roughly as strong at either pole, and its "magnetic equator" is roughly parallel
with its geographical equator.[110] The dipole moment of Uranus is 50 times that of Earth.[109][110]
Neptune has a similarly displaced and tilted magnetic field, suggesting that this may be a common feature
of ice giants.[110] One hypothesis is that, unlike the magnetic fields of the terrestrial and gas giants, which
are generated within their cores, the ice giants' magnetic fields are generated by motion at relatively shallow
depths, for instance, in the water–ammonia ocean.[77][112] Another possible explanation for the
magnetosphere's alignment is that there are oceans of liquid diamond in Uranus's interior that would deter
the magnetic field.[82]
Despite its curious alignment, in other respects the Uranian magnetosphere is like those of other planets: it
has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_shock"] bow shock at about 23 Uranian radii ahead of it, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetopause"] magnetopause at 18 Uranian radii, a fully
developed magnetotail, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_belt"] radiation belts.[109][110][113] Overall, the structure of Uranus's magnetosphere
is different from Jupiter's and more similar to Saturn's.[109][110] Uranus's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetotail"] magnetotail trails behind it into
space for millions of kilometres and is twisted by its sideways rotation into a long corkscrew.[109][114]
Uranus's magnetosphere contains [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_particle"] charged particles: mainly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton"] protons and electrons, with a small amount of
 H2+ ions.[110][113] Many of these particles probably derive from the thermosphere.[113] The ion and
electron energies can be as high as 4 and 1.2 megaelectronvolts, respectively.[113] The density of low-
energy (below 1 kiloelectronvolt) ions in the inner magnetosphere is about 2 cm−3.[115] The particle
population is strongly affected by the Uranian moons, which sweep through the magnetosphere, leaving
noticeable gaps.[113] The particle [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux"] flux is high enough to cause darkening or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_weathering"] space weathering of their
surfaces on an astronomically rapid timescale of 100,000 years.[113] This may be the cause of the uniformly
dark colouration of the Uranian satellites and rings.[116] Uranus has relatively well developed aurorae,
which are seen as bright arcs around both magnetic poles.[105] Unlike Jupiter's, Uranus's aurorae seem to
be insignificant for the energy balance of the planetary thermosphere.[108] In March 2020, NASA
astronomers reported the detection of a large atmospheric magnetic bubble, also known as a plasmoid,
released into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space"] outer space from the planet Uranus, after reevaluating old data recorded by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_2"] Voyager  2
 space probe during a flyby of the planet in 1986.[117][118]
Climate
At ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, Uranus's atmosphere is bland in comparison to the other giant
planets, even to Neptune, which it otherwise closely resembles.[24] When Voyager 2 flew by Uranus in
1986, it observed a total of ten [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud"] cloud features across the entire planet.[22][119] One proposed explanation for
this dearth of features is that Uranus's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_heat"] internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant
planets. The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus's tropopause is 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), making
Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System.[17][88]
Banded structure, winds and clouds
In 1986, Voyager 2 found that the visible southern hemisphere of Uranus can be subdivided into two
regions: a bright polar cap and dark equatorial bands.[22] Their boundary is located at about −45° of
latitude. A narrow band straddling the latitudinal range from −45 to −50° is the brightest large feature on its
visible surface.[22][120] It is called a southern "collar". The cap and collar are thought to be a dense region
of methane clouds located within the pressure range of 1.3 to 2 bar (see above).[121] Besides the large-scale
banded structure, Voyager 2 observed ten small bright clouds, most lying several degrees to the north from
the collar.[22] In all other respects Uranus looked like a dynamically dead planet in 1986. Voyager 2 arrived
during the height of Uranus's southern summer and could not observe the northern hemisphere. At the
Page 12
beginning of the 21st century, when the northern polar region came
into view, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keck_telescopes"] Keck telescope
initially observed neither a collar nor a polar cap in the northern
hemisphere.[120] So Uranus appeared to be asymmetric: bright near
the south pole and uniformly dark in the region north of the
southern collar.[120] In 2007, when Uranus passed its equinox, the
southern collar almost disappeared, and a faint northern collar
emerged near 45° of latitude.[122]
In the 1990s, the number of the observed bright cloud features
grew considerably partly because new high-resolution imaging
techniques became available.[24] Most were found in the northern
hemisphere as it started to become visible.[24] An early explanation 
The first dark spot observed on

 ACS in 2006.
—that bright clouds are easier to identify in its dark part, whereas in
the southern hemisphere the bright collar masks them – was shown to be incorrect.[123][124] Nevertheless,
there are differences between the clouds of each hemisphere. The northern clouds are smaller, sharper and
brighter.[124] They appear to lie at a higher altitude.[124] The lifetime of clouds spans several orders of
magnitude. Some small clouds live for hours; at least one southern cloud may have persisted since the
Voyager 2 flyby.[24][119] Recent observation also discovered that cloud features on Uranus have a lot in
common with those on Neptune.[24] For example, the dark spots common on Neptune had never been
observed on Uranus before 2006, when the first such feature dubbed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Uranus#Uranus_Dark_Spot"] Uranus Dark Spot was imaged.[125]
The speculation is that Uranus is becoming more Neptune-like during its equinoctial season.[126]
The tracking of numerous cloud features allowed determination of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zonal_and_meridional"] zonal winds blowing in the upper
troposphere of Uranus.[24] At the equator winds are retrograde, which means that they blow in the reverse
direction to the planetary rotation. Their speeds are from −360 to −180 km/h (−220 to −110 mph).[24][120]
Wind speeds increase with the distance from the equator, reaching zero values near ±20° latitude, where the
troposphere's temperature minimum is located.[24][87] Closer to the poles, the winds shift to a prograde
direction, flowing with Uranus's rotation. Wind speeds continue to increase reaching maxima at ±60°
latitude before falling to zero at the poles.[24] Wind speeds at −40° latitude range from 540 to 720 km/h
(340 to 450 mph). Because the collar obscures all clouds below that parallel, speeds between it and the
southern pole are impossible to measure.[24] In contrast, in the northern hemisphere maximum speeds as
high as 860 km/h (540 mph) are observed near +50° latitude.[24][120][127]
Seasonal variation
For a short period from March to May 2004, large clouds appeared in the Uranian atmosphere, giving it a
Neptune-like appearance.[124][128] Observations included record-breaking wind speeds of 820 km/h
(510 mph) and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as "Fourth of July fireworks".[119] On 23 August
2006, researchers at the Space Science Institute (Boulder, Colorado) and the University of Wisconsin
observed a dark spot on Uranus's surface, giving scientists more insight into Uranus atmospheric
activity.[125] Why this sudden upsurge in activity occurred is not fully known, but it appears that Uranus's
extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather.[129][126] Determining the nature of
this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on Uranus's atmosphere have existed for less than 84
years, or one full Uranian year. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photometry_(astronomy)"] Photometry over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s)
has shown regular variation in the brightness in two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_band"] spectral bands, with maxima occurring at the solstices
and minima occurring at the equinoxes.[130] A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has
been noted in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave"] microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s.[131] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere"] Stratospheric
Page 13
temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum
values near the 1986 solstice.[104] The majority of this variability is thought
to occur owing to changes in the viewing geometry.[123]
There are some indications that physical seasonal changes are happening in
Uranus. Although Uranus is known to have a bright south polar region, the
north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the
seasonal change outlined above.[126] During its previous northern solstice
in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests
that the north pole was not always so dim.[130] This information implies
that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens
after the equinox.[126] Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data
revealed that the periodical changes of brightness are not completely

hemisphere are visible (HST
ACS image). 
symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the
 meridional albedo patterns.[126] In the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from
its solstice, Hubble and ground-based telescopes revealed that the south
polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained
bright),[121] whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing
activity,[119] such as cloud formations and stronger winds, bolstering
expectations that it should brighten soon.[124] This indeed happened in
2007 when it passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, and the southern collar became nearly
invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained slightly asymmetric, with northern winds being
somewhat slower than southern.[122]
The mechanism of these physical changes is still not clear.[126] Near the summer and winter solstices,
Uranus's hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the Sun's rays or facing deep space. The
brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and
haze layers located in the troposphere.[121] The bright collar at −45° latitude is also connected with
methane clouds.[121] Other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower
cloud layers.[121] The variation of the microwave [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_(electromagnetic_radiation)"] emission from Uranus is probably caused by changes in
the deep tropospheric circulation, because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.[132] Now
that the spring and autumn equinoxes are arriving on Uranus, the dynamics are changing and convection
can occur again.[119][132]
Formation
It is argued that the differences between the ice giants and the gas giants arise from their formation
history.[133][134][135] The Solar System is hypothesised to have formed from a rotating disk of gas and dust
known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presolar_nebula"] presolar nebula. Much of the nebula's gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, formed the Sun,
and the dust grains collected together to form the first protoplanets. As the planets grew, some of them
eventually accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold on to the nebula's leftover gas.[133][134][136] The
more gas they held onto, the larger they became; the larger they became, the more gas they held onto until a
critical point was reached, and their size began to increase exponentially.[137] The ice giants, with only a
few Earth masses of nebular gas, never reached that critical point.[133][134][138] Recent simulations of
 planetary migration have suggested that both ice giants formed closer to the Sun than their present
positions, and moved outwards after formation (the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_model"] Nice model).[133]
Moons
Page 14
Uranus has 27 known [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellites"] natural satellites.[138] The
names of these satellites are chosen from characters
 in the works of Shakespeare and Alexander
Pope.[76][139] The five main satellites are Miranda,
Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon.[76] The
Uranian satellite system is the least massive among
those of the giant planets; the combined mass of the
five major satellites would be less than half that of
 Triton (largest moon of Neptune) alone.[12] The

 the Moon, but slightly more than Rhea, the second-largest satellite of Saturn, making Titania the eighth-
largest moon in the Solar System. Uranus's satellites have relatively low albedos; ranging from 0.20 for
Umbriel to 0.35 for Ariel (in green light).[22] They are ice–rock conglomerates composed of roughly 50%
ice and 50% rock. The ice may include ammonia and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"] carbon dioxide.[116][140]
Among the Uranian satellites, Ariel appears to have the youngest surface, with the fewest impact craters,
and Umbriel the oldest.[22][116] Miranda has fault canyons 20 km (12 mi) deep, terraced layers, and a
chaotic variation in surface ages and features.[22] Miranda's past geologic activity is thought to have been
driven by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_heating"] tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently, probably as a result of a
former 3:1 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance"] orbital resonance with Umbriel.[141] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift"] Extensional processes associated with upwelling [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diapir"] diapirs are
the likely origin of Miranda's 'racetrack'-like coronae.[142][143] Ariel is thought to have once been held in a
4:1 resonance with Titania.[144]
Uranus has at least one [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_orbit"] horseshoe orbiter occupying the Sun–Uranus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point#L3"] L3 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point"] Lagrangian point—a

is also a promising Uranus
Rings 
The Uranian rings are composed of extremely dark particles, which
vary in size from micrometres to a fraction of a metre.[22] Thirteen
distinct rings are presently known, the brightest being the ε ring.
All except two rings of Uranus are extremely narrow – they are
usually a few kilometres wide. The rings are probably quite young;
the dynamics considerations indicate that they did not form with
Uranus. The matter in the rings may once have been part of a moon
(or moons) that was shattered by high-speed impacts. From
numerous pieces of debris that formed as a result of those impacts,
only a few particles survived, in stable zones corresponding to the
locations of the present rings.[116][147]
Uranus's aurorae against its
equatorial rings, imaged by the
Hubble telescope. Unlike the aurorae
of Earth and Jupiter, those of Uranus
are not in line with its poles, due to
its lopsided magnetic field. 
William Herschel described a possible ring around Uranus in 1789.
This sighting is generally considered doubtful, because the rings are
quite faint, and in the two following centuries none were noted by
other observers. Still, Herschel made an accurate description of the
epsilon ring's size, its angle relative to Earth, its red colour, and its
apparent changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun.[148][149] The
ring system was definitively discovered on 10 March 1977 by
 James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Mink"] Jessica Mink using the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_Airborne_Observatory"] Kuiper Airborne Observatory. The
Page 15
discovery was serendipitous; they planned to use the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occultation"] occultation of the star SAO 158687 (also known as
HD 128598) by Uranus to study its atmosphere. When their observations were analysed, they found that
the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind Uranus.
They concluded that there must be a ring system around Uranus.[150] Later they detected four additional
rings.[150] The rings were directly imaged when Voyager  2 passed Uranus in 1986.[22] Voyager  2 also
discovered two additional faint rings, bringing the total number to eleven.[22]
In December 2005, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope"] Hubble Space Telescope detected a pair of previously unknown rings. The largest
is located twice as far from Uranus as the previously known rings. These new rings are so far from Uranus
that they are called the "outer" ring system. Hubble also spotted two small satellites, one of which, Mab,
shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring. The new rings bring the total number of Uranian
rings to 13.[151] In April 2006, images of the new rings from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keck_Observatory"] Keck Observatory yielded the colours of
the outer rings: the outermost is blue and the other one red.[152][153] One hypothesis concerning the outer
ring's blue colour is that it is composed of minute particles of water ice from the surface of Mab that are
small enough to scatter blue light.[152][154] In contrast, Uranus's inner rings appear grey.[152]
Exploration
In 1986, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA"] NASA's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_2"] Voyager 2 interplanetary probe encountered Uranus. This
 flyby remains the only investigation of Uranus carried out from a short
distance and no other visits are planned. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1"] Voyager 1 was unable to visit
Uranus because investigation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn"] Saturn's moon [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_(moon)"] Titan was considered a
priority. This trajectory took Voyager 1 out of the plane of the ecliptic,
ending its planetary science mission.[155]: 118  Launched in 1977, Voyager 2
made its closest approach to Uranus on 24 January 1986, coming within
81,500 km (50,600 mi) of the cloudtops, before continuing its journey to
Neptune. The spacecraft studied the structure and chemical composition of
Uranus's atmosphere,[95] including its unique weather, caused by its axial
tilt of 97.77°. It made the first detailed investigations of its five largest
moons and discovered 10 new ones. Voyager 2 examined all nine of the
 system's known rings and discovered two more.[22][116][156] It also studied
the magnetic field, its irregular structure, its tilt and its unique corkscrew
 magnetotail caused by Uranus's sideways orientation.[109]

The possibility of sending the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens"] Cassini spacecraft from Saturn to Uranus was evaluated during a mission
extension planning phase in 2009, but was ultimately rejected in favour of destroying it in the Saturnian
atmosphere.[157] It would have taken about twenty years to get to the Uranian system after departing
 Saturn.[157] A Uranus orbiter and probe was recommended by the 2013–2022 Planetary Science Decadal
Survey published in 2011; the proposal envisages launch during 2020–2023 and a 13-year cruise to
Uranus.[158] A Uranus entry probe could use [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Venus_Multiprobe"] Pioneer Venus Multiprobe heritage and descend to 1–5
atmospheres.[158] The ESA evaluated a "medium-class" mission called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus_Pathfinder"] Uranus Pathfinder.[159] A New
Frontiers Uranus Orbiter has been evaluated and recommended in the study, The Case for a Uranus
Orbiter.[160] Such a mission is aided by the ease with which a relatively big mass can be sent to the system
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_Uranus_missions"] —over 1500 kg with an Atlas 521 and 12-year journey.[161] For more concepts see proposed Uranus
missions.
In April, 2022, the next [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_Science_Decadal_Survey"] Planetary Science Decadal Survey placed its highest priority for the next "flagship"
project on a full package mission (orbiter and probe) to Uranus, with a projected launch window starting in
2031. The "dearth" of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_giant"] ice giant science was key to its prioritization. Another key issue was that such a
mission would use extant technology, and not require development of other instruments and systems to be
successful.[162]

In culture
In astrology, the planet Uranus (symbol ) is the ruling planet of Aquarius. Because
Uranus is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyan"] cyan and Uranus is associated with electricity, the colour [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_blue_(color)"] electric blue, which is
close to cyan, is associated with the sign Aquarius[163] (see [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus_(astrology)"] Uranus in astrology).
 The chemical element uranium, discovered in 1789 by the German chemist Martin Heinrich
Klaproth, was named after the then-newly discovered Uranus.[164]
"Uranus, the Magician" is a movement in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Holst"] Gustav Holst's orchestral suite [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Planets"] The Planets, written

take back [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalingrad"] Stalingrad and marked the turning point in the land war against the Wehrmacht.
The lines "Then felt I like some watcher of the skies/When a new planet swims into his ken",
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats"] John Keats's "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_First_Looking_into_Chapman%27s_Homer"] On First Looking into Chapman's Homer", are a reference to Herschel's
discovery of Uranus.[165]
In English language popular culture, humor is often derived from the common pronunciation
of Uranus's name, which resembles that of the phrase "your anus".[166]

And then run, quickly."[42]

Bereits in der am 12ten März 1782 bei der hiesigen naturforschenden
Gesellschaft vorgelesenen Abhandlung, habe ich den Namen des Vaters vom
Saturn, nemlich Uranos, oder wie er mit der lateinischen Endung gewöhnlicher
ist, Uranus vorgeschlagen, und habe seit dem das Vergnügen gehabt, daß
verschiedene Astronomen und Mathematiker in ihren Schriften oder in Briefen an
mich, diese Benennung aufgenommen oder gebilligt. Meines Erachtens muß
man bei dieser Wahl die Mythologie befolgen, aus welcher die uralten Namen
der übrigen Planeten entlehnen worden; denn in der Reihe der bisher
bekannten, würde der von einer merkwürdigen Person oder Begebenheit der
neuern Zeit wahrgenommene Name eines Planeten sehr auffallen. Diodor von
Cicilien erzahlt die Geschichte der Atlanten, eines uralten Volks, welches eine
der fruchtbarsten Gegenden in Africa bewohnte, und die Meeresküsten seines
Landes als das Vaterland der Götter ansah. Uranus war ihr, erster König, Stifter
ihres gesitteter Lebens und Erfinder vieler nützlichen Künste. Zugleich wird er
auch als ein fleißiger und geschickter Himmelsforscher des Alterthums
beschrieben... Noch mehr: Uranus war der Vater des Saturns und des Atlas, so
wie der erstere der Vater des Jupiters.
[Translated]:
Already in the pre-read at the local Natural History Society on 12th March 1782
treatise, I have the father's name from Saturn, namely Uranos, or as it is usually
with the Latin suffix, proposed Uranus, and have since had the pleasure that
various astronomers and mathematicians, cited in their writings or letters to me
approving this designation. In my view, it is necessary to follow the mythology in
this election, which had been borrowed from the ancient name of the other
planets; because in the series of previously known, perceived by a strange
person or event of modern times name of a planet would very noticeable.
Diodorus of Cilicia tells the story of Atlas, an ancient people that inhabited one of
the most fertile areas in Africa, and looked at the sea shores of his country as the
homeland of the gods. Uranus was her first king, founder of their civilized life and
inventor of many useful arts. At the same time he is also described as a diligent
and skilful astronomers of antiquity ... even more: Uranus was the father of Saturn
and the Atlas, as the former is the father of Jupiter.
