Mercury (planet)
Mercury is the smallest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet"] planet in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System"] Solar System and the
closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth
days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets. It is named after the
Roman god Mercurius (Mercury),  god of commerce,
messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and
mortals, corresponding to the Greek god [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes"] Hermes (Ἑρμῆς).
Like Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_orbit"] Earth's orbit as an
 inferior planet, and its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_distance"] apparent distance from the Sun as
viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the
Sun means the planet can only be seen near the western
horizon [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dusk"] after sunset or the eastern horizon [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn"] before sunrise,
usually in twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-
like object, but is more difficult to observe than Venus. From
Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete range of
phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which recurs over its
 synodic period of approximately 116 days.
Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It
 is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit
resonance,[17] meaning that relative to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_stars"] fixed stars, it
rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two
revolutions it makes around the Sun.[a][18] As seen from the
Sun, in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_of_reference"] frame of reference that rotates with the orbital
motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian
years. An observer on Mercury would therefore see only one
day every two Mercurian years.
Mercury's axis has the smallest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt"] tilt of any of the Solar
System's planets (about 1⁄30 degree). Its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity"] orbital eccentricity is
the largest of all known planets in the Solar System;[b] at
perihelion, Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about
two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's
surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance
to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon"] Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive
for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain
heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than
on any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from 100 K
(−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F)
during the day across the equatorial regions.[19] The polar
regions are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F). The
planet has no known [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite"] natural satellites.
Two spacecraft have visited Mercury: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariner_10"] Mariner 10 flew by in
1974 and 1975; and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER"] MESSENGER,  launched in 2004,

Nomenclature
The ancients knew Mercury by different names depending on
whether it was an evening star or a morning star. By about
350 BCE, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece"] ancient Greeks had realized the two stars were
one.[23] They knew the planet as Στίλβων Stilbōn, meaning
"twinkling", and Ἑρμής [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes"] Hermēs, for its fleeting motion,[24] a
name that is retained in modern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"] Greek (Ερμής Ermis).[25]

Physical characteristics
Mercury is one of four [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_planet"] terrestrial planets in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System"] Solar System,
and is a rocky body like Earth. It is the smallest planet in the
Solar System, with an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equator"] equatorial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius"] radius of 2,439.7 kilometres
(1,516.0 mi).[3] Mercury is also smaller—albeit more massive
—than the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_moons_by_diameter"] largest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite"] natural satellites in the Solar System,
 Ganymede and Titan. Mercury consists of approximately

Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle
overlying a solid, iron sulfide outer core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core.[30][31] The
planet's density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3, only slightly less than Earth's
density of 5.515 g/cm3.[3] If the effect of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_compression"] gravitational compression were to be factored out from both
planets, the materials of which Mercury is made would be denser than those of Earth, with an
uncompressed density of 5.3 g/cm3 versus Earth's 4.4 g/cm3.[32] Mercury's density can be used to infer
details of its inner structure. Although Earth's high density results appreciably from gravitational
compression, particularly at the core, Mercury is much smaller and its inner regions are not as compressed.
Therefore, for it to have such a high density, its core must be large and rich in iron.[33]
The radius of Mercury's core is estimated to be 2,020 ± 30 km (1,255 ± 19 mi), based on interior models
constrained to be consistent with the value of the moment of inertia factor given in the infobox.[9][34]
Hence, Mercury's core occupies about 57% of its volume; for Earth this proportion is 17%. Research
published in 2007 suggests that Mercury has a molten core.[35][36] Surrounding the core is a 500–700 km
(310–430 mi) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)"] mantle consisting of silicates.[37][38] Based on data from the Mariner 10 mission and Earth-
Page 4
based observation, Mercury's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crust_(geology)"] crust is estimated to be 35 km (22 mi) thick.[39] However, this model may be
an overestimate and the crust could be 26 ± 11 km (16.2 ± 6.8 mi) thick based on an Airy [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isostacy"] isostacy
model.[40] One distinctive feature of Mercury's surface is the presence of numerous narrow ridges,
extending up to several hundred kilometers in length. It is thought that these were formed as Mercury's core
and mantle cooled and contracted at a time when the crust had already solidified.[41][42][43]
Mercury's core has a higher iron content than that of any other major planet in the Solar System, and
several theories have been proposed to explain this. The most widely accepted theory is that Mercury
originally had a metal–silicate ratio similar to common [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrite"] chondrite meteorites, thought to be typical of the
Solar System's rocky matter, and a mass approximately 2.25 times its current mass.[44] Early in the Solar
System's history, Mercury may have been struck by a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetesimal"] planetesimal of approximately 1/6 Mercury's mass
and several thousand kilometers across.[44] The impact would have stripped away much of the original
crust and mantle, leaving the core behind as a relatively major component.[44] A similar process, known as
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_impact_hypothesis"] giant impact hypothesis, has been proposed to explain the formation of the Moon.[44]
Alternatively, Mercury may have formed from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_nebula"] solar nebula before the Sun's energy output had
stabilized. It would initially have had twice its present mass, but as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protostar"] protosun contracted, temperatures
near Mercury could have been between 2,500 and 3,500 K and possibly even as high as 10,000 K.[45]
Much of Mercury's surface rock could have been vaporized at such temperatures, forming an atmosphere of
"rock vapor" that could have been carried away by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_wind"] solar wind.[45]
A third hypothesis proposes that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_nebula"] solar nebula caused [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)"] drag on the particles from which Mercury was
accreting, which meant that lighter particles were lost from the accreting material and not gathered by
Mercury.[46] Each hypothesis predicts a different surface composition, and there are two space missions set
to make observations. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER"] MESSENGER, which ended in 2015, found higher-than-expected potassium and
sulfur levels on the surface, suggesting that the giant impact hypothesis and vaporization of the crust and
mantle did not occur because potassium and sulfur would have been driven off by the extreme heat of these
events.[47] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BepiColombo"] BepiColombo, which will arrive at Mercury in 2025, will make observations to test these
hypotheses.[48] The findings so far would seem to favor the third hypothesis; however, further analysis of
the data is needed.[49]
Surface geology
Mercury's surface is similar in appearance to that of the Moon, showing extensive mare-like plains and
heavy cratering, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions of years. It is more
 heterogeneous than the surface of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars"] Mars or the Moon, both of which contain significant stretches of similar
geology, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_mare"] maria and plateaus.[50] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo"] Albedo features are areas of markedly different reflectivity, which
include impact craters, the resulting ejecta, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_system"] ray systems. Larger albedo features correspond to higher
reflectivity plains.[51] Mercury has dorsa (also called "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrinkle-ridge"] wrinkle-ridges"), Moon-like highlands, montes
(mountains), planitiae (plains), rupes (escarpments), and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallis_(planetary_geology)"] valles (valleys).[52][53]
The planet's mantle is chemically heterogeneous, suggesting the planet went through a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_ocean"] magma ocean phase
early in its history. Crystallization of minerals and convective overturn resulted in layered, chemically
heterogeneous crust with large-scale variations in chemical composition observed on the surface. The crust
is low in iron but high in sulfur, resulting from the stronger early [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reduction"] chemically reducing conditions than is
found in the other terrestrial planets. The surface is dominated by iron-poor pyroxene and olivine, as
represented by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enstatite"] enstatite and forsterite, respectively, along with sodium-rich [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagioclase"] plagioclase and minerals of
mixed magnesium, calcium, and iron-sulfide. The less reflective regions of the crust are high in carbon,
most likely in the form of graphite.[54]

Names for features on Mercury come from a variety of sources.
Names coming from people are limited to the deceased. Craters are
named for artists, musicians, painters, and authors who have made
outstanding or fundamental contributions to their field. Ridges, or
dorsa, are named for scientists who have contributed to the study of
Mercury. Depressions or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossa_(geology)"] fossae are named for works of
architecture. Montes are named for the word "hot" in a variety of
languages. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain"] Plains or planitiae are named for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(god)"] Mercury in various
languages. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escarpment"] Escarpments or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rup%C4%93s"] rupēs are named for ships of scientific
expeditions. Valleys or valles are named for abandoned cities,
towns, or settlements of antiquity.[55]

Basin 
Impact basins and craters
Mercury was heavily bombarded by comets and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroid"] asteroids during
and shortly following its formation 4.6 billion years ago, as well as
 during a possibly separate subsequent episode called the Late
Heavy Bombardment that ended 3.8 billion years ago.[56] Mercury
received impacts over its entire surface during this period of intense
crater formation,[53] facilitated by the lack of any [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestial_body_atmosphere"] atmosphere to
slow impactors down.[57] During this time Mercury was
 volcanically active; basins were filled by magma, producing
smooth plains similar to the maria found on the Moon.[58][59] An
unusual crater with radiating troughs has been discovered that
scientists called "the spider".[60] It was later named
Apollodorus.[61]
 Craters on Mercury range in diameter from small bowl-shaped
cavities to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-ringed_impact_basin"] multi-ringed impact basins hundreds of kilometers across. They appear in all states of
degradation, from relatively fresh rayed craters to highly degraded crater remnants. Mercurian craters differ
subtly from lunar craters in that the area blanketed by their ejecta is much smaller, a consequence of
Mercury's stronger surface gravity.[62] According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Astronomical_Union"] International Astronomical Union (IAU) rules, each
new crater must be named after an artist who was famous for more than fifty years, and dead for more than
three years, before the date the crater is named.[63]
 The largest known crater is Caloris
Planitia, or Caloris Basin, with a
diameter of 1,550 km.[64] The impact
that created the Caloris Basin was so
powerful that it caused [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava"] lava eruptions
and left a concentric mountainous ring
~2 km tall surrounding the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_crater"] impact crater.
The floor of the Caloris Basin is filled
by a geologically distinct flat plain,
broken up by ridges and fractures in a
roughly polygonal pattern. It is not clear 
Overhead view of Caloris Perspective view of Caloris Basin –

whether they are volcanic lava flows
induced by the impact or a large sheet of impact melt.[62]
Page 6
At the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes"] antipode of the Caloris Basin is a large region of unusual, hilly terrain known as the "Weird Terrain".
One hypothesis for its origin is that shock waves generated during the Caloris impact traveled around
Mercury, converging at the basin's antipode (180 degrees away). The resulting high stresses fractured the
surface.[65] Alternatively, it has been suggested that this terrain formed as a result of the convergence of
ejecta at this basin's antipode.[66]
Overall, 46 impact basins have been identified.[67] A notable basin
is the 400 km wide, multi-ring [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolstoj_Basin"] Tolstoj Basin that has an ejecta
blanket extending up to 500 km from its rim and a floor that has
been filled by smooth plains materials. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beethoven_Basin"] Beethoven Basin has a
similar-sized ejecta blanket and a 625 km diameter rim.[62] Like the
Moon, the surface of Mercury has likely incurred the effects of
 space weathering processes, including solar wind and
 micrometeorite impacts.[68]
Plains
There are two geologically distinct plains regions on
 Mercury.[62][69] Gently rolling, hilly plains in the regions between
craters are Mercury's oldest visible surfaces,[62] predating the 
Tolstoj basin is along the bottom of
this image of Mercury's limb
heavily cratered terrain. These inter-crater plains appear to have
obliterated many earlier craters, and show a general paucity of smaller craters below about 30 km in
diameter.[69]
Smooth plains are widespread flat areas that fill depressions of various sizes and bear a strong resemblance
to the lunar maria. Unlike lunar maria, the smooth plains of Mercury have the same albedo as the older
inter-crater plains. Despite a lack of unequivocally volcanic characteristics, the localisation and rounded,
lobate shape of these plains strongly support volcanic origins.[62] All the smooth plains of Mercury formed
significantly later than the Caloris basin, as evidenced by appreciably smaller crater densities than on the
Caloris ejecta blanket.[62]
Compressional features
One unusual feature of Mercury's surface is the numerous compression folds, or rupes, that crisscross the
plains. As Mercury's interior cooled, it contracted and its surface began to deform, creating [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrinkle_ridge"] wrinkle ridges
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobate_scarp"] lobate scarps associated with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust_fault"] thrust faults. The scarps can reach lengths of 1000 km and heights of
3 km.[70] These compressional features can be seen on top of other features, such as craters and smooth
plains, indicating they are more recent.[71] Mapping of the features has suggested a total shrinkage of
Mercury's radius in the range of ~1 to 7 km.[72] Most activity along the major thrust systems probably
ended about 3.6–3.7 billion years ago.[73] Small-scale thrust fault scarps have been found, tens of meters in
height and with lengths in the range of a few km, that appear to be less than 50 million years old, indicating
that compression of the interior and consequent surface geological activity continue to the present.[70][72]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Reconnaissance_Orbiter"] Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter discovered that similar but smaller thrust faults exist on the Moon.[74]
Volcanism
There is evidence for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow"] pyroclastic flows on Mercury from low-profile [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield_volcano"] shield volcanoes.[75][76][77] 51
pyroclastic deposits have been identified,[78] where 90% of them are found within impact craters.[78] A
study of the degradation state of the impact craters that host pyroclastic deposits suggests that pyroclastic
Page 7
activity occurred on Mercury over a prolonged interval.[78]
A "rimless depression" inside the southwest rim of the Caloris
Basin consists of at least nine overlapping volcanic vents, each
 individually up to 8 km in diameter. It is thus a "compound
volcano".[79] The vent floors are at least 1 km below their brinks
and they bear a closer resemblance to volcanic craters sculpted by
explosive eruptions or modified by collapse into void spaces
created by magma withdrawal back down into a conduit.[79]
Scientists could not quantify the age of the volcanic complex
system but reported that it could be on the order of a billion
years.[79]
Surface conditions and exosphere
The surface temperature of Mercury ranges from 100 to 700 K
(−173 to 427 °C; −280 to 800 °F)[19] at the most extreme places:
0°N, 0°W, or 180°W. It never rises above 180 K at the poles,[13]
due to the absence of an atmosphere and a steep temperature
gradient between the equator and the poles. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsolar_point"] subsolar point
reaches about 700 K during [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion"] perihelion (0°W or 180°W), but only
550 K at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphelion"] aphelion (90° or 270°W).[81]On the dark side of the
planet, temperatures average 110 K.[13][82]The intensity of
 sunlight on Mercury's surface ranges between 4.59 and 10.61 times
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_constant"] solar constant (1,370 W·m−2).[83] 
 Picasso crater — the large arc-
shaped pit located on the eastern
side of its floor are postulated to
have formed when subsurface
magma subsided or drained, causing
the surface to collapse into the
resulting void.
Although the daylight temperature at the surface of Mercury is  Composite of the north pole of
generally extremely high, observations strongly suggest that ice Mercury, where NASA confirmed the
(frozen water) exists on Mercury. The floors of deep craters at the
poles are never exposed to direct sunlight, and temperatures there
remain below 102 K, far lower than the global average.[84] This 
discovery of a large volume of water
ice, in permanently dark craters that
are found there.[80]
creates a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_trap_(astronomy)"] cold trap where ice can accumulate. Water ice strongly
 reflects radar, and observations by the 70-meter Goldstone Solar
System Radar and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Array"] VLA in the early 1990s revealed that there are patches of high radar [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(physics)"] reflection near
the poles.[85] Although ice was not the only possible cause of these reflective regions, astronomers think it
was the most likely.[86]
The icy regions are estimated to contain about 1014–1015 kg of ice,[87] and may be covered by a layer of
 regolith that inhibits sublimation.[88] By comparison, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica"] Antarctic ice sheet on Earth has a mass of about
4×1018 kg, and Mars's south polar cap contains about 1016 kg of water.[87] The origin of the ice on
Mercury is not yet known, but the two most likely sources are from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outgassing"] outgassing of water from the planet's
interior or deposition by impacts of comets.[87]
Mercury is too small and hot for its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity"] gravity to retain any significant [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere"] atmosphere over long periods of time; it
does have a tenuous surface-bounded [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exosphere"] exosphere[89] containing hydrogen, helium, oxygen, sodium,
calcium, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"] potassium and others[15][16] at a surface pressure of less than approximately 0.5 nPa (0.005
picobars).[3] This exosphere is not stable—atoms are continuously lost and replenished from a variety of
sources. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_atom"] Hydrogen atoms and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium_atom"] helium atoms probably come from the solar wind, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion"] diffusing into Mercury's

is another source of helium, as well as sodium and potassium. MESSENGER found high proportions of
calcium, helium, hydroxide, magnesium, oxygen, potassium, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon"] silicon and sodium. Water vapor is present,
Page 8
released by a combination of processes such as: comets striking its surface, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputtering"] sputtering creating water out of
hydrogen from the solar wind and oxygen from rock, and sublimation from reservoirs of water ice in the
permanently shadowed polar craters. The detection of high amounts of water-related ions like O+, OH−,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydronium"] H3O+ was a surprise.[90][91] Because of the quantities of these ions that were detected in Mercury's
space environment, scientists surmise that these molecules were blasted from the surface or exosphere by
the solar wind.[92][93]
Sodium, potassium and calcium were discovered in the atmosphere during the 1980–1990s, and are
thought to result primarily from the vaporization of surface rock struck by micrometeorite impacts[94]
including presently from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Encke"] Comet Encke.[95] In 2008, magnesium was discovered by MESSENGER.[96]
Studies indicate that, at times, sodium emissions are localized at points that correspond to the planet's
magnetic poles. This would indicate an interaction between the magnetosphere and the planet's surface.[97]
On November 29, 2012, NASA confirmed that images from MESSENGER had detected that craters at the
 north pole contained water ice. MESSENGER's principal investigator Sean Solomon is quoted in The New
York Times estimating the volume of the ice to be large enough to "encase Washington, D.C., in a frozen
block two and a half miles deep".[80]
Magnetic field and magnetosphere
Despite its small size and slow 59-day-long rotation, Mercury has a
significant, and apparently global, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field"] magnetic field. According to
measurements taken by Mariner 10, it is about 1.1% the strength of
Earth's. The magnetic-field strength at Mercury's equator is about
300 nT.[98][99] Like that of Earth, Mercury's magnetic field is
dipolar.[97] Unlike Earth's, Mercury's poles are nearly aligned with
the planet's spin axis.[100] Measurements from both the Mariner 10
and MESSENGER space probes have indicated that the strength
and shape of the magnetic field are stable.[100]  Graph showing relative strength of
Mercury's magnetic field
It is likely that this magnetic field is generated by a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory"] dynamo effect,
in a manner similar to the magnetic field of Earth.[101][102] This
 dynamo effect would result from the circulation of the planet's iron-rich liquid core. Particularly strong tidal
heating effects caused by the planet's high orbital eccentricity would serve to keep part of the core in the
liquid state necessary for this dynamo effect.[37][103]
Mercury's magnetic field is strong enough to deflect the solar wind around the planet, creating a
magnetosphere. The planet's magnetosphere, though small enough to fit within Earth,[97] is strong enough
to trap solar wind plasma. This contributes to the space weathering of the planet's surface.[100]
Observations taken by the Mariner 10 spacecraft detected this low energy plasma in the magnetosphere of
the planet's nightside. Bursts of energetic particles in the planet's magnetotail indicate a dynamic quality to
the planet's magnetosphere.[97]
During its second flyby of the planet on October 6, 2008, MESSENGER discovered that Mercury's
magnetic field can be extremely "leaky". The spacecraft encountered magnetic "tornadoes" – twisted
bundles of magnetic fields connecting the planetary magnetic field to interplanetary space – that were up to
800 km wide or a third of the radius of the planet. These twisted magnetic flux tubes, technically known as
 flux transfer events, form open windows in the planet's magnetic shield through which the solar wind may
enter and directly impact Mercury's surface via [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_reconnection"] magnetic reconnection[104] This also occurs in Earth's
Page 9
magnetic field. The MESSENGER observations showed the reconnection rate is ten times higher at
Mercury, but its proximity to the Sun only accounts for about a third of the reconnection rate observed by
MESSENGER.[104]
Orbit, rotation, and longitude
Mercury has the most [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity"] eccentric orbit of
all the planets in the Solar System; its
eccentricity is 0.21 with its distance
from the Sun ranging from 46,000,000
to 70,000,000 km (29,000,000 to
43,000,000 mi).  It takes 87.969 Earth
days to complete an orbit. The diagram
illustrates the effects of the eccentricity,
showing Mercury's orbit overlaid with a
 circular orbit having the same semi-
major axis. Mercury's higher velocity
when it is near perihelion is clear from
the greater distance it covers in each 5-
day interval. In the diagram, the varying 
Orbit of Mercury (2006) Animation of Mercury's and
Earth's revolution around the
Sun
distance of Mercury to the Sun is
represented by the size of the planet, which is inversely proportional to Mercury's distance from the Sun.
This varying distance to the Sun leads to Mercury's surface being flexed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_bulge"] tidal bulges raised by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"] Sun
that are about 17 times stronger than the Moon's on Earth.[105] Combined with a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance
of the planet's rotation around its axis, it also results in complex variations of the surface temperature.[29]
The resonance makes a single [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_day"] solar day (the length between two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(astronomy)"] meridian transits of the Sun) on Mercury
last exactly two Mercury years, or about 176 Earth days.[106]
Mercury's orbit is inclined by 7 degrees to the plane of Earth's orbit (the ecliptic), the largest of all eight
known solar planets.[107] As a result, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transit_of_Mercury"] transits of Mercury across the face of the Sun can only occur when
the planet is crossing the plane of the ecliptic at the time it lies between Earth and the Sun, which is in May
or November. This occurs about every seven years on average.[108]
Mercury's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt"] axial tilt is almost zero,[109] with the best measured value as low as 0.027 degrees.[110] This is
significantly smaller than that of Jupiter, which has the second smallest axial tilt of all planets at 3.1 degrees.
This means that to an observer at Mercury's poles, the center of the Sun never rises more than 2.1
 arcminutes above the horizon.[110]
At certain points on Mercury's surface, an observer would be able to see the Sun peek up a little more than
two-thirds of the way over the horizon, then reverse and set before rising again, all within the same
 Mercurian day.[c] This is because approximately four Earth days before perihelion, Mercury's angular
 orbital velocity equals its angular [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotational_velocity"] rotational velocity so that the Sun's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improper_motion"] apparent motion ceases; closer to
perihelion, Mercury's angular orbital velocity then exceeds the angular rotational velocity. Thus, to a
hypothetical observer on Mercury, the Sun appears to move in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_retrograde_motion"] retrograde direction. Four Earth days after
perihelion, the Sun's normal apparent motion resumes.[29] A similar effect would have occurred if Mercury
had been in synchronous rotation: the alternating gain and loss of rotation over revolution would have
caused a libration of 23.65° in longitude.[111]
For the same reason, there are two points on Mercury's equator, 180 degrees apart in longitude, at either of
which, around perihelion in alternate Mercurian years (once a Mercurian day), the Sun passes overhead,
then reverses its apparent motion and passes overhead again, then reverses a second time and passes
Page 10
overhead a third time, taking a total of about 16 Earth-days for this entire process. In the other alternate
Mercurian years, the same thing happens at the other of these two points. The amplitude of the retrograde
motion is small, so the overall effect is that, for two or three weeks, the Sun is almost stationary overhead,
and is at its most brilliant because Mercury is at perihelion, its closest to the Sun. This prolonged exposure
to the Sun at its brightest makes these two points the hottest places on Mercury. Maximum temperature
occurs when the Sun is at an angle of about 25 degrees past noon due to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diurnal_temperature_variation#Temperature_lag"] diurnal temperature lag, at 0.4
Mercury days and 0.8 Mercury years past sunrise.[112] Conversely, there are two other points on the
equator, 90 degrees of longitude apart from the first ones, where the Sun passes overhead only when the
planet is at aphelion in alternate years, when the apparent motion of the Sun in Mercury's sky is relatively
rapid. These points, which are the ones on the equator where the apparent retrograde motion of the Sun
happens when it is crossing the horizon as described in the preceding paragraph, receive much less solar
heat than the first ones described above.[113]
Mercury attains inferior conjunction (nearest approach to Earth) every 116 Earth days on average,[3] but
this interval can range from 105 days to 129 days due to the planet's eccentric orbit. Mercury can come as
near as 82,200,000 kilometres (0.549 astronomical units; 51.1 million miles) to Earth, and that is slowly
declining: The next approach to within 82,100,000 km (51.0 million miles) is in 2679, and to within
82,000,000 km (51 million miles) in 4487, but it will not be closer to Earth than 80,000,000 km (50 million
miles) until 28,622.[114] Its period of retrograde motion as seen from Earth can vary from 8 to 15 days on
either side of inferior conjunction. This large range arises from the planet's high orbital eccentricity.[29]
Essentially because Mercury is closest to the Sun, when taking an average over time, Mercury is the closest
planet to the Earth,[115] and—in that measure—it is the closest planet to each of the other planets in the
Solar System.[116][117][118][d]
Longitude convention
The longitude convention for Mercury puts the zero of longitude at one of the two hottest points on the
surface, as described above. However, when this area was first visited, by Mariner 10, this zero meridian
was in darkness, so it was impossible to select a feature on the surface to define the exact position of the
meridian. Therefore, a small crater further west was chosen, called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hun_Kal_(crater)"] Hun Kal, which provides the exact
reference point for measuring longitude.[119][120] The center of Hun Kal defines the 20° west meridian. A
1970 International Astronomical Union resolution suggests that longitudes be measured positively in the
westerly direction on Mercury.[121] The two hottest places on the equator are therefore at longitudes 0° W
and 180° W, and the coolest points on the equator are at longitudes 90° W and 270° W. However, the
MESSENGER project uses an east-positive convention.[122]
Spin-orbit resonance
For many years it was thought that Mercury was synchronously [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_locking"] tidally locked with the Sun, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation"] rotating once
for each orbit and always keeping the same face directed towards the Sun, in the same way that the same
side of the Moon always faces Earth. Radar observations in 1965 proved that the planet has a 3:2 spin-orbit
resonance, rotating three times for every two revolutions around the Sun. The eccentricity of Mercury's
orbit makes this resonance stable—at perihelion, when the solar tide is strongest, the Sun is nearly still in
Mercury's sky.[123]
The rare 3:2 resonant tidal locking is stabilized by the variance of the tidal force along Mercury's eccentric
orbit, acting on a permanent dipole component of Mercury's mass distribution.[124] In a circular orbit there
is no such variance, so the only resonance stabilized in such an orbit is at 1:1 (e.g., Earth–Moon), when the
tidal force, stretching a body along the "center-body" line, exerts a torque that aligns the body's axis of least
inertia (the "longest" axis, and the axis of the aforementioned dipole) to point always at the center.
Page 11
However, with noticeable eccentricity, like that of Mercury's orbit,
the tidal force has a maximum at perihelion and therefore stabilizes
resonances, like 3:2, ensuring that the planet points its axis of least
inertia roughly at the Sun when passing through perihelion.[124]
The original reason astronomers thought it was synchronously
locked was that, whenever Mercury was best placed for
observation, it was always nearly at the same point in its 3:2
resonance, hence showing the same face. This is because,
coincidentally, Mercury's rotation period is almost exactly half of its
synodic period with respect to Earth. Due to Mercury's 3:2 spin-
orbit resonance, a solar day lasts about 176 Earth days.[29] A
 sidereal day (the period of rotation) lasts about 58.7 Earth days.[29] 
After one orbit, Mercury has rotated
Simulations indicate that the orbital eccentricity of Mercury varies
 chaotically from nearly zero (circular) to more than 0.45 over
millions of years due to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy)"] perturbations from the other
planets.[29][125] This was thought to explain Mercury's 3:2 spin-

orbit resonance (rather than the more usual 1:1), because this state is more likely to arise during a period of
high eccentricity.[126] However, accurate modeling based on a realistic model of tidal response has
demonstrated that Mercury was captured into the 3:2 spin-orbit state at a very early stage of its history,
within 20 (more likely, 10) million years after its formation.[127]
Numerical simulations show that a future [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_resonance"] secular [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_resonance"] orbital resonant perihelion interaction with Jupiter may
cause the eccentricity of Mercury's orbit to increase to the point where there is a 1% chance that the planet
will collide with Venus within the next five billion years.[128][129]
Advance of perihelion
In 1859, the French mathematician and astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbain_Le_Verrier"] Urbain Le Verrier reported that the slow [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precession"] precession of
Mercury's orbit around the Sun could not be completely explained by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newtonian_mechanics"] Newtonian mechanics and
perturbations by the known planets. He suggested, among possible explanations, that another planet (or
perhaps instead a series of smaller 'corpuscules') might exist in an orbit even closer to the Sun than that of
Mercury, to account for this perturbation.[130] (Other explanations considered included a slight oblateness
of the Sun.) The success of the search for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune"] Neptune based on its perturbations of the orbit of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus"] Uranus led
astronomers to place faith in this possible explanation, and the hypothetical planet was named Vulcan, but
no such planet was ever found.[131]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perihelion_precession"] perihelion precession of Mercury is 5,600 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcseconds"] arcseconds (1.5556°) per century relative to Earth, or
574.10±0.65 arcseconds per century[132] relative to the inertial ICRF. Newtonian mechanics, taking into
account all the effects from the other planets, predicts a precession of 5,557 arcseconds (1.5436°) per
century.[132] In the early 20th century, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"] Albert Einstein's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity"] general theory of relativity provided the
explanation for the observed precession, by formalizing gravitation as being mediated by the curvature of
spacetime. The effect is small: just 42.98 arcseconds per century for Mercury; it therefore requires a little
over twelve million orbits for a full excess turn. Similar, but much smaller, effects exist for other Solar
 System bodies: 8.62 arcseconds per century for Venus, 3.84 for Earth, 1.35 for Mars, and 10.05 for 1566
Icarus.[133][134]
Habitability
Page 12
There may be scientific support, based on studies reported in March 2020, for considering that parts of the
planet Mercury may have been habitable, and perhaps that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_form"] life forms, albeit likely primitive
microorganisms, may have existed on the planet.[135][136]
Observation
Mercury's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude"] apparent magnitude is calculated to vary between −2.48
(brighter than Sirius) around [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_conjunction"] superior conjunction and +7.25
 (below the limit of naked-eye visibility) around inferior
conjunction.[14] The mean apparent magnitude is 0.23 while the
standard deviation of 1.78 is the largest of any planet. The mean
apparent magnitude at superior conjunction is −1.89 while that at
inferior conjunction is +5.93.[14] Observation of Mercury is
complicated by its proximity to the Sun, as it is lost in the Sun's
glare for much of the time. Mercury can be observed for only a
brief period during either morning or evening twilight.[137]
Mercury can, like several other planets and the brightest stars, be
seen during a total [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse"] solar eclipse.[138]
Like the Moon and Venus, Mercury exhibits [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_phase"] phases as seen from
Earth. It is "new" at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_(astronomy_and_astrology)#Superior_and_inferior"] inferior conjunction and "full" at superior
conjunction. The planet is rendered invisible from Earth on both of
these occasions because of its being obscured by the Sun,[137]
except its new phase during a transit.  Image mosaic by Mariner 10, 1974
Mercury is technically brightest as seen from Earth when it is at a
full phase. Although Mercury is farthest from Earth when it is full, the greater illuminated area that is visible
and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_effect"] opposition brightness surge more than compensates for the distance.[139] The opposite is true for
Venus, which appears brightest when it is a crescent, because it is much closer to Earth than when
gibbous.[139][140] 
Nonetheless, the brightest (full phase) appearance of Mercury is an
essentially impossible time for practical observation, because of the
extreme proximity of the Sun. Mercury is best observed at the first
and last quarter, although they are phases of lesser brightness. The
first and last quarter phases occur at greatest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elongation_(astronomy)"] elongation east and
west of the Sun, respectively. At both of these times Mercury's
separation from the Sun ranges anywhere from 17.9° at perihelion
to 27.8° at aphelion.[141][142] At greatest western elongation,

maximum temperatures of the north
polar region 
 Mercury is more often and easily visible from the Southern
Hemisphere than from the Northern. This is because Mercury's
maximum western elongation occurs only during early autumn in
the Southern Hemisphere, whereas its greatest eastern elongation happens only during late winter in the
Southern Hemisphere.[143] In both of these cases, the angle at which the planet's orbit intersects the horizon
is maximized, allowing it to rise several hours before sunrise in the former instance and not set until several
hours after sundown in the latter from southern mid-latitudes, such as Argentina and South Africa.[143]
Page 13
An alternate method for viewing Mercury involves observing the
planet during daylight hours when conditions are clear, ideally
when it is at its greatest elongation. This allows the planet to be
found easily, even when using telescopes with 8 cm (3.1 in)
apertures. However, great care must be taken to obstruct the Sun
from sight because of the extreme risk for eye damage.[144] This
method bypasses the limitation of twilight observing when the
ecliptic is located at a low elevation (e.g. on autumn evenings).
Ground-based telescope observations of Mercury reveal only an False-color image of Carnegie

45% of its surface from 1974 to 1975. The second is the
MESSENGER spacecraft, which after three Mercury flybys
between 2008 and 2009, attained orbit around Mercury on March 17, 2011,[145] to study and map the rest
of the planet.[146]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Space_Telescope"] Hubble Space Telescope cannot observe Mercury at all, due to safety procedures that prevent its
pointing too close to the Sun.[147]
Because the shift of 0.15 revolutions in a year makes up a seven-year cycle (0.15 × 7 ≈ 1.0), in the seventh
year Mercury follows almost exactly (earlier by 7 days) the sequence of phenomena it showed seven years
before.[141]
Observation history
Ancient astronomers
The earliest known recorded observations of Mercury are from the
 MUL.APIN tablets. These observations were most likely made by
an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria"] Assyrian astronomer around the 14th century BC.[148] The
 cuneiform name used to designate Mercury on the MUL.APIN
tablets is transcribed as UDU.IDIM.GU\U4.UD ("the jumping
planet").[e][149] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_astronomy"] Babylonian records of Mercury date back to the 1st
millennium BC. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia"] Babylonians called the planet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabu"] Nabu after the
messenger to the gods in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_mythology"] their mythology.[150]
The Greco-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt"] Egyptian[151] astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius_Ptolemaeus"] Ptolemy wrote about the

1550
possibility of planetary transits across the face of the Sun in his
work Planetary Hypotheses. He suggested that no transits had been
observed either because planets such as Mercury were too small to see, or because the transits were too
infrequent.[152]
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_China"] ancient China, Mercury was known as "the Hour Star" (Chen-xing 
辰星). It was associated with the
direction north and the phase of water in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Phases"] Five Phases system of metaphysics.[153] Modern Chinese,
Korean, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_culture"] Japanese and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_culture"] Vietnamese cultures refer to the planet literally as the "water star" (
水星), based on
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_elements_(Chinese_philosophy)"] Five elements.[154][155][156] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_mythology"] Hindu mythology used the name [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budha"] Budha for Mercury, and this god was
thought to preside over Wednesday.[157] The god [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin"] Odin (or Woden) of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_paganism"] Germanic paganism was associated
Page 14
with the planet Mercury and Wednesday.[158] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization"] Maya may have
represented Mercury as an owl (or possibly four owls; two for the
morning aspect and two for the evening) that served as a messenger
to the underworld.[159]
 In medieval Islamic astronomy, the Andalusian astronomer Abū
Ishāq Ibrāhīm al-Zarqālī in the 11th century described the deferent
of Mercury's geocentric orbit as being oval, like an egg or a pignon,
although this insight did not influence his astronomical theory or his
astronomical calculations.[160][161] In the 12th century, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Bajjah"] Ibn Bajjah
observed "two planets as black spots on the face of the Sun",
 Ibn al-Shatir's model for the
appearances of Mercury, showing the

century.[162] (Note that most such medieval reports of transits were
later taken as observations of sunspots.[163])
Ptolemaic eccentrics and equant. In India, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_school_of_astronomy_and_mathematics"] Kerala school astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilakantha_Somayaji"] Nilakantha Somayaji in the
15th century developed a partially heliocentric planetary model in
which Mercury orbits the Sun, which in turn orbits Earth, similar to
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tychonic_system"] Tychonic system later proposed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycho_Brahe"] Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century.[164]
Ground-based telescopic research
The first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telescope"] telescopic observations of Mercury were made by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo"] Galileo
in the early 17th century. Although he observed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_phase"] phases when he
looked at Venus, his telescope was not powerful enough to see the
phases of Mercury. In 1631, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gassendi"] Pierre Gassendi made the first
telescopic observations of the transit of a planet across the Sun
when he saw a transit of Mercury predicted by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Kepler"] Johannes Kepler. In
1639, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Zupi"] Giovanni Zupi used a telescope to discover that the planet
had [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit"] orbital phases similar to Venus and the Moon. The observation
demonstrated conclusively that Mercury orbited around the Sun.[29]
A rare event in astronomy is the passage of one planet in front of
another (occultation),  as seen from Earth. Mercury and Venus
occult each other every few centuries, and the event of May 28,
1737 is the only one historically observed, having been seen by
 John Bevis at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Greenwich_Observatory"] Royal Greenwich Observatory.[165] The next
occultation of Mercury by Venus will be on December 3,
2133.[166] 
Transit of Mercury. Mercury is visible
as a black dot below and to the left
of center. The dark area above the
center of the solar disk is a sunspot.
The difficulties inherent in observing Mercury mean that it has been far less studied than the other planets.
In 1800, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Schr%C3%B6ter"] Johann Schröter made observations of surface features, claiming to have observed 20-kilometre-
high (12 mi) mountains. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Bessel"] Friedrich Bessel used Schröter's drawings to erroneously estimate the rotation
period as 24 hours and an axial tilt of 70°.[167] In the 1880s, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Schiaparelli"] Giovanni Schiaparelli mapped the planet more
accurately, and suggested that Mercury's rotational period was 88 days, the same as its orbital period due to
tidal locking.[168] This phenomenon is known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_rotation"] synchronous rotation. The effort to map the surface of
Mercury was continued by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenios_Antoniadi"] Eugenios Antoniadi, who published a book in 1934 that included both maps
and his own observations.[97] Many of the planet's surface features, particularly the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_albedo_features_on_Mercury"] albedo features, take
their names from Antoniadi's map.[169]

 In June 1962, Soviet scientists at the Institute of Radio-engineering
and Electronics of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USSR_Academy_of_Sciences"] USSR Academy of Sciences, led by
 Vladimir Kotelnikov, became the first to bounce a radar signal off
Mercury and receive it, starting radar observations of the
planet.[170][171][172] Three years later, radar observations by
Americans [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_H._Pettengill"] Gordon H. Pettengill and Rolf B. Dyce, using the 300-
meter [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_radio_telescope"] Arecibo radio telescope in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico"] Puerto Rico, showed conclusively
that the planet's rotational period was about 59 days.[173][174] The
theory that Mercury's rotation was synchronous had become widely
held, and it was a surprise to astronomers when these radio
observations were announced. If Mercury were tidally locked, its 
 Elongation is the angle between the
Sun and the planet, with Earth as the
reference point. Mercury appears
close to the Sun.
dark face would be extremely cold, but measurements of radio
emission revealed that it was much hotter than expected.
Astronomers were reluctant to drop the synchronous rotation theory and proposed alternative mechanisms
such as powerful heat-distributing winds to explain the observations.[175]
Water ice (yellow) at Mercury's north
polar region 
Italian astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Colombo"] Giuseppe Colombo noted that the rotation value
was about two-thirds of Mercury's orbital period, and proposed that
the planet's orbital and rotational periods were locked into a 3:2
rather than a 1:1 resonance.[176] Data from Mariner 10
subsequently confirmed this view.[177] This means that
Schiaparelli's and Antoniadi's maps were not "wrong". Instead, the
astronomers saw the same features during every second orbit and
recorded them, but disregarded those seen in the meantime, when
Mercury's other face was toward the Sun, because the orbital
geometry meant that these observations were made under poor
viewing conditions.[167]
Ground-based optical observations did not shed much further light on Mercury, but radio astronomers using
interferometry at microwave wavelengths, a technique that enables removal of the solar radiation, were able
to discern physical and chemical characteristics of the subsurface layers to a depth of several
meters.[178][179] Not until the first space probe flew past Mercury did many of its most fundamental
morphological properties become known. Moreover, recent technological advances have led to improved
ground-based observations. In 2000, high-resolution [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_imaging"] lucky imaging observations were conducted by the
 Mount Wilson Observatory 1.5 meter Hale telescope. They provided the first views that resolved surface
features on the parts of Mercury that were not imaged in the Mariner 10 mission.[180] Most of the planet
has been mapped by the Arecibo radar telescope, with 5 km (3.1 mi) resolution, including polar deposits in
shadowed craters of what may be water ice.[181]
Research with space probes
Reaching Mercury from Earth poses significant technical challenges, because it orbits so much closer to the
Sun than Earth. A Mercury-bound spacecraft launched from Earth must travel over 91 million kilometres
(57 million miles) into the Sun's gravitational [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_well"] potential well. Mercury has an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_speed"] orbital speed of 47.4 km/s
(29.5 mi/s), whereas Earth's orbital speed is 29.8 km/s (18.5 mi/s).[107] Therefore, the spacecraft must make
a large change in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"] velocity ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v"] delta-v) to get to Mercury and then enter orbit,[183] as compared to the delta-v
required for, say, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_of_Mars"] Mars planetary missions.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy"] potential energy liberated by moving down the Sun's potential well becomes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"] kinetic energy, requiring
a delta-v change to do anything other than pass by Mercury. Some portion of this [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v_budget"] delta-v budget can be
provided from a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist"] gravity assist during one or more fly-bys of Venus.[184] To land safely or enter a stable
Page 16
orbit the spacecraft would
rely entirely on rocket
motors. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobraking"] Aerobraking is
ruled out because Mercury
has  a  negligible
atmosphere. A trip to
Mercury requires more
rocket fuel than that Mercury transiting the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun"] Sun as viewed

result, only three space 
by the Mars rover [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_(rover)"] Curiosity (June 3,
2014).[182]
probes have visited it so
far.[185] A proposed alternative approach would use a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail"] solar sail to attain a Mercury-synchronous orbit
around the Sun.[186]
Mariner 10
The first spacecraft to visit Mercury was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA"] NASA's Mariner 10
(1974–1975).[23] The spacecraft used the gravity of Venus to adjust
its orbital velocity so that it could approach Mercury, making it both
the first spacecraft to use this [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_slingshot"] gravitational "slingshot" effect and the
first NASA mission to visit multiple planets.[187] Mariner 10
provided the first close-up images of Mercury's surface, which
immediately showed its heavily cratered nature, and revealed many
other types of geological features, such as the giant scarps that were
later ascribed to the effect of the planet shrinking slightly as its iron
core cools.[188] Unfortunately, the same face of the planet was lit at
each of Mariner 10's  close approaches. This made close
observation of both sides of the planet impossible,[189] and resulted
in the mapping of less than 45% of the planet's surface.[190] 
Mariner 10, the first probe to visit
Mercury
The spacecraft made three close approaches to Mercury, the closest of which took it to within 327 km
(203 mi) of the surface.[191] At the first close approach, instruments detected a magnetic field, to the great
surprise of planetary geologists—Mercury's rotation was expected to be much too slow to generate a
significant [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo"] dynamo effect. The second close approach was primarily used for imaging, but at the third
approach, extensive magnetic data were obtained. The data revealed that the planet's magnetic field is much
like Earth's, which deflects the solar wind around the planet. For many years after the Mariner 10
encounters, the origin of Mercury's magnetic field remained the subject of several competing
theories.[192][193]
On March 24, 1975, just eight days after its final close approach, Mariner 10 ran out of fuel. Because its
orbit could no longer be accurately controlled, mission controllers instructed the probe to shut down.[194]
Mariner 10 is thought to be still orbiting the Sun, passing close to Mercury every few months.[195]
MESSENGER
A second NASA mission to Mercury, named MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment,
GEochemistry, and Ranging), was launched on August 3, 2004. It made a fly-by of Earth in August 2005,
and of Venus in October 2006 and June 2007 to place it onto the correct trajectory to reach an orbit around
Mercury.[196] A first fly-by of Mercury occurred on January 14, 2008, a second on October 6, 2008,[197]
Page 17
and a third on September 29, 2009.[198] Most of the hemisphere
not imaged by Mariner 10 was mapped during these fly-bys. The
probe successfully entered an elliptical orbit around the planet on
March 18, 2011. The first orbital image of Mercury was obtained
on March 29, 2011. The probe finished a one-year mapping
mission,[197] and then entered a one-year extended mission into
2013. In addition to continued observations and mapping of
Mercury, MESSENGER observed the 2012 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_maximum"] solar maximum.[199]
The mission was designed to clear up six key issues: Mercury's
high density, its geological history, the nature of its magnetic field,
the structure of its core, whether it has ice at its poles, and where its
tenuous atmosphere comes from. To this end, the probe carried
imaging devices that gathered much-higher-resolution images of
much more of Mercury than Mariner 10, assorted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrometer"] spectrometers to
determine abundances of elements in the crust, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetometer"] magnetometers 
Estimated details of the impact of
MESSENGER on April 30, 2015
and devices to measure velocities of charged particles.
Measurements of changes in the probe's orbital velocity were expected to be used to infer details of the
planet's interior structure.[200] MESSENGER 's final maneuver was on April 24, 2015, and it crashed into
Mercury's surface on April 30, 2015.[201][202][203] The spacecraft's impact with Mercury occurred near
3:26 pm EDT on April 30, 2015, leaving a crater estimated to be 16 m (52 ft) in diameter.[204]
BepiColombo
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency"] European Space Agency and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAXA"] Japanese Space Agency developed and launched a joint mission
called BepiColombo, which will orbit Mercury with two probes: one to map the planet and the other to
study its magnetosphere.[205] Launched on October 20, 2018, BepiColombo is expected to reach Mercury
in 2025.[206] It will release a magnetometer probe into an elliptical orbit, then chemical rockets will fire to
deposit the mapper probe into a circular orbit. Both probes will operate for one terrestrial year.[205] The
mapper probe carries an array of spectrometers similar to those on MESSENGER, and will study the planet
at many different wavelengths including infrared, ultraviolet, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"] X-ray and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"] gamma ray.[207] BepiColombo
conducted the first of its six planned Mercury flybys on October 1, 2021.[208]

Notes
a. In astronomy, the words "rotation" and "revolution" have different meanings. "Rotation" is the
turning of a body about an axis that passes through the body, as in "Earth rotates once a
day." "Revolution" is motion around a centre that is external to the body, usually in orbit, as
in "Earth takes a year for each revolution around the Sun." The verbs "rotate" and "revolve"
mean doing rotation and revolution, respectively.

b. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto"] Pluto was considered a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet"] planet from its discovery in 1930 to 2006, but after that it has been
reclassified as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_planet"] dwarf planet. Pluto's orbital eccentricity is greater than Mercury's. Pluto is
also smaller than Mercury, but was thought to be larger until 1976.
c. The Sun's total angular displacement during its apparent retrograde motion as seen from the
surface of Mercury is ~1.23°, while the Sun's angular diameter when the apparent retrograde
motion begins and ends is ~1.71°, increasing to ~1.73° at perihelion (midway through the
retrograde motion).
d. It is important to be clear about the meaning of 'closeness'. In the astronomical literature, the
term 'closest planets' often means 'the two planets that approach each other most closely'. In
other words, the orbits of the two planets approach each other most closely. However, this
does not mean that the two planets are closest over time. For example, essentially because
Mercury is closer to the Sun than Venus, Mercury spends more time in proximity to Earth; it
could, therefore, be said that Mercury is the planet that is 'closest to Earth when averaged
over time'. However, using this time-average definition of 'closeness'—as noted above—it
turns out that Mercury is the closest planet to all other planets in the solar system. For that
reason, arguably, the proximity-definition is not particularly helpful. An episode of the BBC
Radio 4 programme 'More or Less' explains the different notions of proximity well.[115]
e. Some sources precede the cuneiform transcription with "MUL". "MUL" is a cuneiform sign
that was used in the Sumerian language to designate a star or planet, but it is not
considered part of the actual name. The "4" is a reference number in the Sumero–Akkadian
transliteration system to designate which of several syllables a certain cuneiform sign is
most likely designating.
