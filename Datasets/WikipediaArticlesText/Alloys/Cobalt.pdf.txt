Cobalt
Cobalt is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"] chemical element with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_(chemistry)"] symbol Co
and atomic number 27. As with nickel, cobalt is
found in the Earth's crust only in a chemically
combined form, save for small deposits found in
alloys of natural [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoric_iron"] meteoric iron. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_element"] free element,
produced by reductive smelting, is a hard,
lustrous, silver-gray metal.

Cobalt-based blue pigments ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_blue"] cobalt blue) have
been used since ancient times for jewelry and
paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to
glass, but the color was for a long time thought to
be due to the known metal bismuth. Miners had
long used the name [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobold"] kobold ore (German for
goblin ore)  for some of the blue-pigment-
producing minerals; they were so named because
they were poor in known metals, and gave
poisonous arsenic-containing fumes when
smelted. In 1735, such ores were found to be
reducible to a new metal (the first discovered
since ancient times),  and this was ultimately
named for the kobold.
Today, some cobalt is produced specifically from
one of a number of metallic-lustered ores, such as
 cobaltite (CoAsS).  The element is, however,
more usually produced as a by-product of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper"] copper
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel"] nickel mining. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copperbelt"] Copperbelt in the
 Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and
 Zambia yields most of the global cobalt
production. World production in 2016 was
116,000 tonnes (114,000 long tons; 128,000 short
tons) (according to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Resources_Canada"] Natural Resources Canada),
and the DRC alone accounted for more than
50%.[4]
Cobalt is primarily used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery"] lithium-ion batteries,
and in the manufacture of magnetic, wear-
resistant and high-strength alloys. The
 compounds cobalt silicate and cobalt(II)
aluminate (CoAl2O4,  cobalt blue) give a
distinctive deep blue color to glass, ceramics,
inks, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint"] paints and varnishes. Cobalt occurs
naturally as only one stable isotope, cobalt-59.

permeability two-thirds that of iron.[7] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"] Metallic cobalt occurs as two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_structure"] crystallographic structures: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_close_packed"] hcp and
fcc. The ideal transition temperature between the hcp and fcc structures is 450 °C (842 °F), but in practice
the energy difference between them is so small that random intergrowth of the two is common.[8][9][10]
Cobalt is a weakly reducing metal that is protected from oxidation by a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivation_(chemistry)"] passivating [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"] oxide film. It is attacked
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halogens"] halogens and sulfur. Heating in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"] oxygen produces [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt(II,III)_oxide"] Co3O4 which loses oxygen at 900 °C (1,650 °F) to
give the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt(II)_oxide"] monoxide CoO.[11] The metal reacts with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine"] fluorine ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine"] F2) at 520 K to give [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt(III)_fluoride"] CoF3; with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"] chlorine ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"] Cl2),
 bromine ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromine"] Br2) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"] iodine ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"] I2), producing equivalent binary halides. It does not react with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_gas"] hydrogen gas
([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen"] H2) or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_gas"] nitrogen gas ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"] N2) even when heated, but it does react with boron, carbon, phosphorus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic"] arsenic and
sulfur.[12] At ordinary temperatures, it reacts slowly with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_acids"] mineral acids, and very slowly with moist, but not
with dry, air.
Compounds
Common [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidation_states"] oxidation states of cobalt include +2 and +3, although compounds with oxidation states ranging
from −3 to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percobaltate"] +5 are also known. A common oxidation state for simple compounds is +2 (cobalt(II)). These

Several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"] oxides of cobalt are known. Green [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt(II)_oxide"] cobalt(II) oxide (CoO) has [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_crystal_system"] rocksalt structure. It is readily
oxidized with water and oxygen to brown cobalt(III) hydroxide (Co(OH)3). At temperatures of 600–
700 °C, CoO oxidizes to the blue [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt(II,III)_oxide"] cobalt(II,III) oxide (Co3O4), which has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinel"] spinel structure.[3] Black
Page 4
 cobalt(III) oxide (Co2O3) is also known.[14] Cobalt oxides are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiferromagnetic"] antiferromagnetic at low temperature: CoO
([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A9el_temperature"] Néel temperature 291 K) and Co3O4 (Néel temperature: 40 K), which is analogous to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetite"] magnetite (Fe3O4),
with a mixture of +2 and +3 oxidation states.[15]
The principal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcogen"] chalcogenides of cobalt include the black [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt(II)_sulfide"] cobalt(II) sulfides, CoS2, which adopts a pyrite-like
structure, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_sulfide"] cobalt(III) sulfide (Co2S3).
Halides 
Four [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dihalide"] dihalides of cobalt(II) are known: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt(II)_fluoride"] cobalt(II) fluoride (CoF2,
pink), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt(II)_chloride"] cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl2, blue), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt(II)_bromide"] cobalt(II) bromide (CoBr2,
green), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt(II)_iodide"] cobalt(II) iodide (CoI2, blue-black). These halides exist in
anhydrous and hydrated forms. Whereas the anhydrous dichloride
is blue, the hydrate is red.[16]
The reduction potential for the reaction Co3+ 
+ e− → Co2+ 
is
Cobalt(II) chloride hexahydrate +1.92 V, beyond that for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine"] chlorine to chloride, +1.36 V.
Consequently, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt(III)_chloride"] cobalt(III) chloride would spontaneously reduce to
cobalt(II) chloride and chlorine. Because the reduction potential for
fluorine to fluoride is so high, +2.87 V, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt(III)_fluoride"] cobalt(III) fluoride is one of the few simple stable cobalt(III)
compounds. Cobalt(III) fluoride, which is used in some fluorination reactions, reacts vigorously with
water.[11]
Coordination compounds
 As for all metals, molecular compounds and polyatomic ions of cobalt are classified as coordination
complexes, that is, molecules or ions that contain cobalt linked to one or more ligands. These can be

Isotopes
59Co is the only stable cobalt [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"] isotope and the only [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"] isotope that exists naturally on Earth. Twenty-two
 radioisotopes have been characterized: the most stable, 60Co, has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"] half-life of 5.2714 years; 57Co has a
half-life of 271.8 days; 56Co has a half-life of 77.27 days; and 58Co has a half-life of 70.86 days. All the
other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive"] radioactive isotopes of cobalt have half-lives shorter than 18 hours, and in most cases shorter than
1 second. This element also has 4 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_state"] meta states, all of which have half-lives shorter than 15 minutes.[27]
The isotopes of cobalt range in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_weight"] atomic weight from 50 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass_unit"] u (50Co) to 73 u (73Co). The primary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_mode"] decay mode
for isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the only stable isotope, 59Co, is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_capture"] electron capture
 and the primary mode of decay in isotopes with atomic mass greater than 59 atomic mass units is beta
decay. The primary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_product"] decay products below 59Co are element 26 (iron) isotopes; above that the decay
products are element 28 (nickel) isotopes.[27]
History
Cobalt compounds have been used for centuries to impart a rich blue color to glass, glazes, and ceramics.
Cobalt has been detected in Egyptian sculpture, Persian jewelry from the third millennium BC, in the ruins
 of Pompeii, destroyed in 79 AD, and in China, dating from the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD) and the Ming
dynasty (1368–1644 AD).[28]
Page 6
Cobalt has been used to color glass since the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age"] Bronze Age. The excavation
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uluburun_shipwreck"] Uluburun shipwreck yielded an ingot of blue glass, cast during the
14th century BC.[29][30] Blue glass from Egypt was either colored with
copper, iron, or cobalt. The oldest cobalt-colored glass is from the
 eighteenth dynasty of Egypt (1550–1292 BC). The source for the cobalt
the Egyptians used is not known.[31][32]
The word cobalt is derived from the German kobalt, from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobold"] kobold meaning
"goblin", a superstitious term used for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore"] ore of cobalt by miners. The first
attempts to smelt those ores for copper or silver failed, yielding simply
powder (cobalt(II) oxide) instead. Because the primary ores of cobalt
Early Chinese blue and
white porcelain, 
always contain arsenic, smelting the ore oxidized the arsenic into the highly
toxic and volatile [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic(III)_oxide"] arsenic oxide, adding to the notoriety of the ore.[33]
manufactured c. 1335  Swedish chemist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Brandt"] Georg Brandt (1694–1768) is credited with discovering
cobalt circa 1735, showing it to be a previously unknown element, distinct
from bismuth and other traditional metals. Brandt called it a new "semi-
metal".[34][35] He showed that compounds of cobalt metal were the source of the blue color in glass, which
previously had been attributed to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth"] bismuth found with cobalt. Cobalt became the first metal to be
discovered since the pre-historical period. All other known metals (iron, copper, silver, gold, zinc, mercury,
tin, lead and bismuth) had no recorded discoverers.[36]
During the 19th century, a significant part of the world's production of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_blue"] cobalt blue (a pigment made with
cobalt compounds and alumina) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalt"] smalt ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_glass"] cobalt glass powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics
and painting) was carried out at the Norwegian Blaafarveværket.[37][38] The first mines for the production
of smalt in the 16th century were located in Norway, Sweden, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxony"] Saxony and Hungary. With the discovery of
cobalt ore in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia"] New Caledonia in 1864, the mining of cobalt in Europe declined. With the discovery of ore
deposits in Ontario, Canada in 1904 and the discovery of even larger deposits in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katanga_Province"] Katanga Province in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DR_Congo"] Congo in 1914, the mining operations shifted again.[33] When the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaba_II"] Shaba conflict started in 1978, the
copper mines of Katanga Province nearly stopped production.[39][40] The impact on the world cobalt
economy from this conflict was smaller than expected: cobalt is a rare metal, the pigment is highly toxic,
and the industry had already established effective ways for recycling cobalt materials. In some cases,
industry was able to change to cobalt-free alternatives.[39][40]
In 1938, John Livingood and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_T._Seaborg"] Glenn T. Seaborg discovered the radioisotope [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt-60"] cobalt-60.[41] This isotope was
 famously used at Columbia University in the 1950s to establish parity violation in radioactive beta
decay.[42][43]
After World War II, the US wanted to guarantee the supply of cobalt ore for military uses (as the Germans
had been doing) and prospected for cobalt within the U.S. border. An adequate supply of the ore was found
in Idaho near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbird_Mine"] Blackbird canyon in the side of a mountain. The firm Calera Mining Company started
production at the site.[44]
It has been argued that cobalt will be one of the main objects of geopolitical competition in a world running
on renewable energy and dependent on batteries, but this perspective has also been criticised for
underestimating the power of economic incentives for expanded production.[45]

 The stable form of cobalt is produced in supernovae through the r-process.[46] It comprises 0.0029% of the
Earth's crust. Free cobalt (the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_metal"] native metal) is not found on Earth because of the oxygen in the atmosphere
and the chlorine in the ocean. Both are abundant enough in the upper layers of the Earth's crust to prevent
native metal cobalt from forming. Except as recently delivered in meteoric iron, pure cobalt in native metal
form is unknown on Earth. The element has a medium abundance but natural compounds of cobalt are
numerous and small amounts of cobalt compounds are found in most rocks, soils, plants, and animals.
In nature, cobalt is frequently associated with nickel. Both are characteristic components of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoric_iron"] meteoric iron,
though cobalt is much less abundant in iron meteorites than nickel. As with nickel, cobalt in meteoric iron
 alloys may have been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to remain as the free (but alloyed)
metal,[47] though neither element is seen in that form in the ancient terrestrial crust.
Cobalt in compound form occurs in copper and nickel minerals. It is the major metallic component that
combines with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur"] sulfur and arsenic in the sulfidic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobaltite"] cobaltite (CoAsS),  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safflorite"] safflorite (CoAs2),  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucodot"] glaucodot
((Co,Fe)AsS), and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skutterudite"] skutterudite (CoAs3) minerals.[11] The mineral [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattierite"] cattierite is similar to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrite"] pyrite and occurs
together with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaesite"] vaesite in the copper deposits of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katanga_Province"] Katanga Province.[48] When it reaches the atmosphere,
 weathering occurs; the sulfide minerals oxidize and form pink [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythrite"] erythrite ("cobalt glance":
 Co3(AsO4)2·8H2O) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherocobaltite"] spherocobaltite (CoCO3).[49][50]
 Cobalt is also a constituent of tobacco smoke.[51] The tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates heavy
 metals like cobalt from the surrounding soil in its leaves. These are subsequently inhaled during tobacco
smoking.[52]
In the ocean
Cobalt is a trace metal involved in photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation detected in most ocean basins and is
a limiting micronutrient for phytoplankton and cyanobacteria.[53][54] The Co-containing complex
cobalamin is only synthesized by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria"] cyanobacteria and a few archaea, so dissolved cobalt concentrations are
low in the upper ocean. Like Mn and Fe, Co has a hybrid profile of biological uptake by phytoplankton via
photosynthesis in the upper ocean and scavenging in the deep ocean, although most scavenging is limited
by complex organic ligands.[55][56] Co is recycled in the ocean by decaying organic matter that sinks below
the upper ocean, although most is scavenged by oxidizing bacteria.
Sources of cobalt for many ocean bodies include rivers and terrestrial runoff with some input from
hydrothermal vents.[57] In the deep ocean, cobalt sources are found lying on top of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamounts"] seamounts (which can
be large or small) where [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_currents"] ocean currents sweep the ocean floor to clear [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment"] sediment over the span of millions of
years allowing them to form as ferromanganese crusts.[58] Although limited [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrography"] mapping of the seafloor has
been done, preliminary investigation indicates that there is a large amount of these cobalt-rich crusts located
in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarion_Clipperton_Zone"] Clarion Clipperton Zone,[59] an area garnering increasing interest for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea_mining"] deep sea mining ventures due
to the mineral-rich environment within its domain. Anthropogenic input contributes as a non-natural source
but in very low amounts. Dissolved cobalt (dCo) concentrations across oceans are controlled primarily by
reservoirs where dissolved oxygen concentrations are low. The complex biochemical cycling of cobalt in
the ocean is still somewhat misunderstood, but patterns of higher concentrations have been found in areas
of low oxygen[60] such as the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) in the Southern Atlantic Ocean.[61]
Cobalt is considered toxic for marine environments at high concentrations.[62] Safe concentrations fall
around 18 μg/L in marine waters for plankton such as diatoms. Most coastal toxicity levels are influenced
by anthropogenic input like sewage runoff and burning of fossil fuels. High levels of Co and Se have been
recorded in seafood sourced from coastal areas with higher levels of the trace metals. Although scientists
are aware of threatening toxicity, less attention has been paid compared to other trace metals like mercury
and lead in contaminated water systems.

Production 
The main ores of cobalt are
cobaltite, erythrite, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucodot"] glaucodot and
 skutterudite (see above), but most
cobalt is obtained by reducing the
cobalt [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-product"] by-products of nickel and
 copper mining and smelting.[64][65]
Since cobalt is generally produced
as a by-product, the supply of  World production trend

and the exact composition of the used ore. One method
is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Froth_flotation"] froth flotation, in which [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfactant"] surfactants bind to ore
components, leading to an enrichment of cobalt ores.

Extraction
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Geological_Survey"] United States Geological Survey estimates world reserves of cobalt at 7,100,000 metric tons.[70] The
 Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) currently produces 63% of the world's cobalt. This market share
may reach 73% by 2025 if planned expansions by mining producers like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glencore"] Glencore Plc take place as
expected. But by 2030, global demand could be 47 times more than it was in 2017, Bloomberg New
Energy Finance has estimated.[71]
Page 9
Changes that Congo made to mining laws in 2002 attracted new investments in Congolese copper and
cobalt projects. Glencore's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutanda_Mine"] Mutanda Mine shipped 24,500 tons of cobalt in 2016, 40% of Congo DRC's
output and nearly a quarter of global production. After oversupply, Glencore closed Mutanda for two years
in late 2019.[72][73] Glencore's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katanga_Mining"] Katanga Mining project is resuming as well and should produce 300,000
tons of copper and 20,000 tons of cobalt by 2019, according to Glencore.[66]
After hitting near-decade highs in early 2018 above US$100,000
per tonne, prices for cobalt used in the global electric battery supply
chain slipped by 45% in the following 2 years. With the upsurge in
Electric (EV) vehicle demand over 2020 and into 2021, cobalt
prices have surged in January 2021. March 2021 cobalt price index
shows prices gaining month on month to US$54,000 per tonne on
19 March 2021, making gains of 35% over 2 months.
Cobalt is ranked as a critical mineral by the United States, Japan,
Republic of Korea, the United Kingdom and the European Union.

Democratic Republic of the Congo
In 2005, the top producer of cobalt was the copper deposits in the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo"] Democratic Republic of the Congo's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katanga_Province"] Katanga Province. Formerly
Shaba province, the area had almost 40% of global reserves,
reported the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Geological_Survey"] British Geological Survey in 2009.[74] By 2015,
 Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) supplied 60% of world
cobalt production, 32,000 tons at $20,000 to $26,000 per ton.
Recent growth in production could at least partly be due to how 
Cobalt prices 2016 to 2021 5 years
(USD$ per ton)
low mining production fell during DRC Congo's very violent civil
wars in the early 2000s, or to the changes the country made to its Mining Code in 2002 to encourage
foreign and multinational investment and which did bring in a number of investors, including Glencore.
 Artisanal mining supplied 17% to 40% of the DRC production.[75] Some 100,000 cobalt miners in Congo
DRC use hand tools to dig hundreds of feet, with little planning and fewer safety measures, say workers
and government and NGO officials, as well as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post"] The Washington Post reporters' observations on visits to
isolated mines. The lack of safety precautions frequently causes injuries or death.[76] Mining pollutes the
vicinity and exposes local wildlife and indigenous communities to toxic metals thought to cause birth
defects and breathing difficulties, according to health officials.[77]
 Human rights activists have alleged, and investigative journalism reported confirmation,[78][79] that child
labor is used in mining cobalt from African [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisanal_mining"] artisanal mines.[75][80] This revelation prompted cell phone
maker [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."] Apple Inc., on March 3, 2017, to stop buying ore from suppliers such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_Huayou_Cobalt"] Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt
who source from artisanal mines in the DRC, and begin using only suppliers that are verified to meet its
workplace standards.[81][82]
There is a push globally by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"] EU and major car manufacturers (OEM) for global production of cobalt to
be sourced and produced sustainably, responsibly and traceability of the supply chain. Mining companies
are adopting and practising [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_Social,_Governance"] ESG initiatives in line with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD"] OECD Guidance and putting in place evidence of
zero to low carbon footprint activities in the supply chain production of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery"] Lithium-ion batteries. These
initiatives are already taking place with major mining companies, Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining
companies (ASM). Car manufacturers and battery manufacturer supply chains Tesla, VW, BMW, BASF,
Glencore are participating in several initiatives, such as the Responsible Cobalt Initiative and Cobalt for
Page 10
Development study. In 2018 BMW Group in partnership with BASF, Samsung SDI and Samsung
Electronics have launched a pilot project in the DRC over one pilot mine, to improve conditions and
address challenges for artisanal miners and the surrounding communities.
The political and ethnic dynamics of the region have in the past caused outbreaks of violence and years of
armed conflict and displaced populations. This instability affected the price of cobalt and also created
perverse incentives for the combatants in the First and Second Congo Wars to prolong the fighting, since
access to diamond mines and other valuable resources helped to finance their military goals—which
frequently amounted to genocide—and also enriched the fighters themselves. While DR Congo has in the
2010s not recently been invaded by neighboring military forces, some of the richest mineral deposits adjoin
areas where Tutsis and Hutus still frequently clash, unrest continues although on a smaller scale and
refugees still flee outbreaks of violence.[83]
Cobalt extracted from small Congolese [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisanal_mining"] artisanal mining endeavors in 2007 supplied a single Chinese
company, Congo DongFang International Mining. A subsidiary of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_Huayou_Cobalt"] Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, one of the
world's largest cobalt producers, Congo DongFang supplied cobalt to some of the world's largest battery
manufacturers, who produced batteries for ubiquitous products like the Apple iPhones. Because of accused
labour violations and environmental concerns, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Chem"] LG Chem subsequently audited Congo DongFang in
accordance with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD"] OECD guidelines. LG Chem, which also produces battery materials for car companies,
imposed a code of conduct on all suppliers that it inspects.[84]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukondo_Mountain"] Mukondo Mountain project, operated by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_African_Mining_and_Exploration_Company"] Central African Mining and Exploration Company
(CAMEC) in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katanga_Province"] Katanga Province, may be the richest cobalt reserve in the world. It produced an estimated
one-third of the total global cobalt production in 2008.[85] In July 2009, CAMEC announced a long-term
agreement to deliver its entire annual [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_(economics)"] production of cobalt concentrate from Mukondo Mountain to
Zhejiang Galico Cobalt & Nickel Materials of China.[86]
In February 2018, global asset management firm [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AllianceBernstein"] AllianceBernstein defined the DRC as economically "the
 Saudi Arabia of the electric vehicle age", due to its cobalt resources, as essential to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery"] lithium-ion batteries
that drive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle"] electric vehicles.[87]
On March 9, 2018, President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kabila"] Joseph Kabila updated the 2002 mining code, increasing royalty charges and
declaring cobalt and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coltan"] coltan "strategic metals".[88][89]
The 2002 mining code was effectively updated on December 4, 2018.[90]
In December 2019, International Rights Advocates, a human rights NGO, filed a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Rights_Advocates_v._Apple,_Microsoft,_Dell,_Tesla"] landmark lawsuit against
Apple, Tesla, Dell, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"] Microsoft and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google"] Google company [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc."] Alphabet for "knowingly benefiting from and aiding
and abetting the cruel and brutal use of young children" in mining cobalt.[91] The companies in question
denied their involvement in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour"] child labour.[92]
Canada
In 2017, some exploration companies were planning to survey old silver and cobalt mines in the area of
 Cobalt, Ontario where significant deposits are believed to lie.[93]
Canada's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherritt_International"] Sherritt International processes cobalt ores in nickel deposits from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moa,_Cuba"] Moa mines in Cuba, and
the island has several others mines in Mayari, Camaguey, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinar_del_Rio"] Pinar del Rio. Continued investments by
Sherritt International in Cuban nickel and cobalt production while acquiring mining rights for 17–20 years
made the communist country third for cobalt reserves in 2019, before Canada itself.[94]
Page 11
Applications
In 2016, 116,000 tonnes of cobalt was used.[4]Cobalt has been used in the production of high-performance
alloys.[64][65] It can also be used to make rechargeable batteries, and the advent of electric vehicles and
their success with consumers probably has a great deal to do with the DRC's soaring production. Other
important factors were the 2002 Mining Code, which encouraged investment by foreign and transnational
corporations such as Glencore, and the end of the First and Second Congo Wars.
Alloys
Cobalt-based [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superalloy"] superalloys have historically consumed most of the cobalt produced.[64][65] The temperature
stability of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_turbine"] gas turbines and aircraft [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine"] jet engines,
although nickel-based [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-crystal"] single-crystal alloys surpass them in performance.[95] Cobalt-based alloys are also
corrosion- and wear-resistant, making them, like titanium, useful for making orthopedic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implant_(medicine)"] implants that don't
wear down over time. The development of wear-resistant cobalt alloys started in the first decade of the 20th
century with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellite"] stellite alloys, containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon. Alloys
with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium"] chromium and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten_carbide"] tungsten carbides are very hard and wear-resistant.[96] Special cobalt-chromium-
 molybdenum alloys like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitallium"] Vitallium are used for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis"] prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements).[97] Cobalt
alloys are also used for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_implant"] dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel, which may be allergenic.[98]
Some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_steel"] high-speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wear resistance. The special alloys of
 aluminium, nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and cobalt (samarium-cobalt
magnet) are used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_magnets"] permanent magnets.[99] It is also alloyed with 95% [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"] platinum for jewelry, yielding an
alloy suitable for fine casting, which is also slightly magnetic.[100]
Batteries
 Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) is widely used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery"] lithium-ion battery cathodes. The material is composed of
cobalt oxide layers with the lithium intercalated. During discharge (i.e. when not actively being charged),
the lithium is released as lithium ions.[101] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel-cadmium_battery"] Nickel-cadmium[102] (NiCd) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel_metal_hydride_battery"] nickel metal hydride[103]
(NiMH) batteries also include cobalt to improve the oxidation of nickel in the battery.[102] Transparency
Market Research estimated the global lithium-ion battery market at $30 billion in 2015 and predicted an
increase to over US$75 billion by 2024.[104]
Although in 2018 most cobalt in batteries was used in a mobile device,[105] a more recent application for
cobalt is rechargeable batteries for electric cars. This industry has increased five-fold in its demand for
cobalt, which makes it urgent to find new raw materials in more stable areas of the world.[106] Demand is
expected to continue or increase as the prevalence of electric vehicles increases.[107] Exploration in 2016–
2017 included the area around [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt,_Ontario"] Cobalt, Ontario, an area where many silver mines ceased operation decades
ago.[106] Cobalt for electric vehicles increased 81% from the first half of 2018 to 7,200 tonnes in the first
half of 2019, for a battery capacity of 46.3 GWh.[108][109] The future of electric cars may depend on deep-
sea mining, since cobalt is abundant in rocks on the seabed.[110]
Since child and slave labor have been repeatedly reported in cobalt mining, primarily in the artisanal mines
of DR Congo, technology companies seeking an ethical supply chain have faced shortages of this raw
material and[111] the price of cobalt metal reached a nine-year high in October 2017, more than US$30 a
pound, versus US$10 in late 2015.[112] After oversupply, the price dropped to a more normal $15 in
2019.[113][114] As a reaction to the issues with artisanal cobalt mining in DR Congo a number of cobalt
suppliers and their customers have formed the Fair Cobalt Alliance (FCA) which aims to end the use of
Page 12
child labor and to improve the working conditions of cobalt mining and processing in the DR Congo.
Members of FCA include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_Huayou_Cobalt"] Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sono_Motors_Sion"] Sono Motors, the Responsible Cobalt Initiative,
Fairphone, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glencore"] Glencore and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc."] Tesla, Inc.[115][116]
Research is being conducted by the European Union on the possibility to eliminate cobalt requirements in
lithium-ion battery production.[117][118] As of August 2020 battery makers have gradually reduced the
cathode cobalt content from 1/3 ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_nickel_manganese_cobalt_oxides"] NMC 111) to 2/10 (NMC 442) to currently 1/10 (NMC 811) and have
 also introduced the cobalt free LFP cathode into the battery packs of electric cars such as the Tesla Model
3.[119][120] In September 2020, Tesla outlined their plans to make their own, cobalt-free battery cells.[121]
Catalysts
 Several cobalt compounds are oxidation catalysts. Cobalt acetate is used to convert xylene to terephthalic
acid, the precursor of the bulk polymer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene_terephthalate"] polyethylene terephthalate. Typical catalysts are the cobalt
 carboxylates (known as cobalt soaps). They are also used in paints, varnishes, and inks as "drying agents"
through the oxidation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drying_oils"] drying oils.[122][101] The same carboxylates are used to improve the adhesion
 between steel and rubber in steel-belted radial tires. In addition they are used as accelerators in polyester
resin systems.[123][124][125]
Cobalt-based catalysts are used in reactions involving [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide"] carbon monoxide. Cobalt is also a catalyst in the
 Fischer–Tropsch process for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogenation"] hydrogenation of carbon monoxide into liquid fuels.[126]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroformylation"] Hydroformylation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkene"] alkenes often uses [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_octacarbonyl"] cobalt octacarbonyl as a catalyst,[127] although it is often replaced
by more efficient iridium- and rhodium-based catalysts, e.g. the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cativa_process"] Cativa process.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrodesulfurization"] hydrodesulfurization of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum"] petroleum uses a catalyst derived from cobalt and molybdenum. This process
helps to clean petroleum of sulfur impurities that interfere with the refining of liquid fuels.[101]
Pigments and coloring 
Before the 19th century, cobalt was
predominantly used as a pigment. It has
been used since the Middle Ages to make
smalt, a blue-colored glass. Smalt is
produced by melting a mixture of roasted
 mineral smaltite, quartz and potassium
carbonate, which yields a dark blue
silicate glass, which is finely ground after
Cobalt blue glass  the production.[128] Smalt was widely
used to color glass and as pigment for
paintings.[129] In 1780, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sven_Rinman"] Sven Rinman
discovered [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_green"] cobalt green, and in 1802 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Jacques_Th%C3%A9nard"] Louis Jacques Thénard discovered cobalt
blue.[130] Cobalt pigments such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_blue"] cobalt blue (cobalt aluminate), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerulean"] cerulean blue
(cobalt(II) stannate), various hues of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_green"] cobalt green (a mixture of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt(II)_oxide"] cobalt(II) oxide
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_oxide"] zinc oxide), and cobalt violet ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt_phosphate"] cobalt phosphate) are used as artist's pigments
because of their superior chromatic stability.[131][132] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aureolin"] Aureolin (cobalt yellow) is
now largely replaced by more lightfast yellow pigments. 
Cobalt-colored glass
Radioisotopes
Page 13
 Cobalt-60 (Co-60 or 60Co) is useful as a gamma-ray source because it can be produced in predictable
amounts with high [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_(radioactivity)"] activity by bombarding cobalt with neutrons. It produces [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"] gamma rays with energies of
1.17 and 1.33 MeV.[27][133]
Cobalt is used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_beam_radiotherapy"] external beam radiotherapy, sterilization of medical supplies and medical waste, radiation
treatment of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_irradiation"] foods for sterilization (cold pasteurization),[134] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_radiography"] industrial radiography (e.g. weld integrity
radiographs), density measurements (e.g. concrete density measurements), and tank fill height switches.
 The metal has the unfortunate property of producing a fine dust, causing problems with radiation
protection. Cobalt from radiotherapy machines has been a serious hazard when not discarded properly, and
one of the worst radiation contamination accidents in North America occurred in 1984, when a discarded
radiotherapy unit containing cobalt-60 was mistakenly disassembled in a junkyard in Juarez,
Mexico.[135][136]
Cobalt-60 has a radioactive half-life of 5.27 years. Loss of potency requires periodic replacement of the
 source in radiotherapy and is one reason why cobalt machines have been largely replaced by linear
accelerators in modern radiation therapy.[137] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_cobalt"] Cobalt-57 (Co-57 or 57Co) is a cobalt radioisotope most often
used in medical tests, as a radiolabel for vitamin B12 
uptake, and for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schilling_test"] Schilling test. Cobalt-57 is used as
a source in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ssbauer_spectroscopy"] Mössbauer spectroscopy and is one of several possible sources in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_fluorescence"] X-ray fluorescence
devices.[138][139]
 Nuclear weapon designs could intentionally incorporate 59Co, some of which would be activated in a
 nuclear explosion to produce 60Co. The 60Co, dispersed as nuclear fallout, is sometimes called a cobalt
bomb.[140]
[141]
Other uses
Cobalt is used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroplating"] electroplating for its attractive appearance, hardness, and resistance to
oxidation.[142]
It is also used as a base primer coat for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcelain"] porcelain enamels.[143]
Biological role
Cobalt is essential to the metabolism of all animals. It is a key constituent of cobalamin, also known as
vitamin B12, the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultratrace_element"] ultratrace element.[144][145] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"] Bacteria in the
stomachs of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant"] ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B12, a compound which can only be
produced by bacteria or archaea. A minimal presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the
health of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grazing"] grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20 mg/kg a day is recommended because they have no other
source of vitamin B12.[146]
Proteins based on cobalamin use [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrin"] corrin to hold the cobalt. Coenzyme B12 features a reactive C-Co bond
that participates in the reactions.[147] In humans, B12 has two types of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkane"] alkyl ligand: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"] methyl and adenosyl.
 MeB12 promotes methyl (−CH3) group transfers. The adenosyl version of B12 catalyzes rearrangements in
which a hydrogen atom is directly transferred between two adjacent atoms with concomitant exchange of
the second substituent, X, which may be a carbon atom with substituents, an oxygen atom of an alcohol, or
an amine. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylmalonyl_coenzyme_A_mutase"] Methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase (MUT) converts [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-methylmalonyl-CoA"] MMl-CoA to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succinyl-CoA"] Su-CoA, an important step in
the extraction of energy from proteins and fats.[148]
Page 14
Although far less common than other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalloprotein"] metalloproteins (e.g. those of zinc and iron), other cobaltoproteins are
known besides B12. These proteins include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAP2"] methionine aminopeptidase 2, an enzyme that occurs in
humans and other mammals that does not use the corrin ring of B12, but binds cobalt directly. Another non-
corrin cobalt enzyme is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrile_hydratase"] nitrile hydratase, an enzyme in bacteria that metabolizes nitriles.[149]
Cobalt deficiency
In humans, consumption of cobalt-containing vitamin B12 meets all needs for cobalt. For cattle and sheep,
which meet vitamin B12 needs via synthesis by resident bacteria in the rumen, there is a function for
 inorganic cobalt. In the early 20th century, during the development of farming on the North Island Volcanic
Plateau of New Zealand, cattle suffered from what was termed "bush sickness". It was discovered that the
volcanic soils lacked the cobalt salts essential for the cattle food chain.[150][151] The "coast disease" of
sheep in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety_Mile_Desert"] Ninety Mile Desert of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone_Coast"] Southeast of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia"] South Australia in the 1930s was found to originate in
nutritional deficiencies of trace elements cobalt and copper. The cobalt deficiency was overcome by the
development of "cobalt bullets", dense pellets of cobalt oxide mixed with clay given orally for lodging in
the animal's rumen.[152][151][153] 
 Cobalamin Cobalt-deficient sheep
Health issues
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose"] LD50 value for soluble cobalt salts has been estimated to be
 between 150 and 500 mg/kg.[155] In the US, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has designated a
 permissible exposure limit (PEL) in the workplace as a time-
 weighted average (TWA) of 0.1 mg/m3. The National Institute for
 Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended
exposure limit (REL) of 0.05 mg/m3, time-weighted average. The
 IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is
20 mg/m3.[156]
However, chronic cobalt ingestion has caused serious health
problems at doses far less than the lethal dose. In 1966, the
addition of cobalt compounds to stabilize [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_foam"] beer foam in Canada led

to a peculiar form of toxin-induced cardiomyopathy, which came
to be known as beer drinker's cardiomyopathy.[157][158]
Furthermore, cobalt metal is suspected of causing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"] cancer (i.e.,
 possibly carcinogenic, IARC Group 2B) as per the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs.[159]
It causes respiratory problems when inhaled.[160] It also causes
skin problems when touched; after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel"] nickel and chromium, cobalt is
a major cause of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_contact_dermatitis"] contact dermatitis.[161]
