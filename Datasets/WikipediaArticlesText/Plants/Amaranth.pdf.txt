Amaranth
Amaranthus is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitan_distribution"] cosmopolitan [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"] genus of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"] annual or short-lived
 perennial plants collectively known as amaranths.[1] Some
amaranth species are cultivated as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_vegetable"] leaf vegetables, pseudocereals,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornamental_plant"] ornamental plants. Most of the Amaranthus species are
summer annual weeds and are commonly referred to as
 pigweeds.[2] Catkin-like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyme_(botany)"] cymes of densely packed flowers grow
in summer or autumn.[3] Amaranth varies in flower, leaf, and
stem color with a range of striking [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_pigments"] pigments from the spectrum
of maroon to crimson and can grow longitudinally from 1 to 2.5
metres (3 to 8 feet) tall with a cylindrical, succulent, fibrous stem
that is hollow with grooves and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bract"] bracteoles when mature.[4]
There are approximately 75 species in the genus, 10 of which
are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioecious"] dioecious and native to North America with the remaining 65
 monoecious species [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic"] endemic to every continent (except
Antarctica) from tropical lowlands to the Himalayas.[5] Members
of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members
of the closely related genus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celosia"] Celosia. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranth_grain"] Amaranth grain is collected
from the genus. The leaves of some species are also eaten.[6]

Description
Amaranth is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbaceous_plant"] herbaceous plant or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrub"] shrub that is either annual or
 perennial across the genus.[4] Flowers vary interspecifically from
the presence of 3 or 5 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepal"] tepals and stamens, whereas a 7-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen"] porate
pollen grain structure remains consistent across the family.[4]
 Species across the genus contain concentric rings of vascular
bundles, and fix carbon efficiently with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation"] C4 photosynthetic
pathway.[4] Leaves are approximately 6.5–15 centimetres (21⁄2–6
inches) and of oval or elliptical shape that are either opposite or
alternate across species, although most leaves are whole and simple
with entire margins.[4] 
Amaranth grain (left) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"] wheat
(right)
Amaranth has a primary root with deeper spreading secondary
fibrous root structures.[7] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflorescence"] Inflorescences are in the form a large [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panicle"] panicle that varies from terminal to axial,
color, and sex. The tassel of fluorescence is either erect or bent and varies in width and length between
species. Flowers are radially symmetric and either bisexual or unisexual with very small, bristly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perianth"] perianth
and pointy bracts.[7] Species in this genus are either [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monecious"] monecious (e.g. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_hybridus"] A.  hybridus,) or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioecious"] dioecious (e.g.
 A. palmeri).[7] Fruits are in the form of capsules referred to as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unilocular"] unilocular pixdio that opens at maturity.[7]
The top (operculum) of the unilocular pixdio releases the urn that contains the seed.[7] Seeds are circular
form from 1 to 1.5 millimeters in diameter and range in color with a shiny, smooth seed coat.[7] The panicle
is harvested 200 days after cultivation with approximately 1,000 to 3,000 seeds harvested per gram.[8]
Phytochemistry
Amaranth grain contains [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochemical"] phytochemicals that are not defined as nutrients and may be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinutrient"] antinutrient factors,
such as polyphenols, saponins, tannins, and oxalates. These compounds are reduced in content and
antinutrient effect by cooking.[9][10]
Taxonomy
Amaranthus shows a wide variety of morphological diversity among and even within certain species.
Amaranthus is part of the Amaranthaceae that is part of the larger grouping of the Carophyllales.[4]
Although the family (Amaranthaceae) is distinctive, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"] genus has few distinguishing characters among the
75 species present across six continents.[11] This complicates [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)"] taxonomy and Amaranthus has generally
been considered among systematists as a "difficult" genus and hybridize often.[12]
In 1955, Sauer classified the genus into two subgenera, differentiating only between monoecious and
dioecious species: Acnida (L.) Aellen ex K.R. Robertson and Amaranthus.[12] Although this classification
was widely accepted, further infrageneric classification was (and still is) needed to differentiate this widely
diverse group. Mosyakin and Robertson 1996 later divided into three subgenera: Acnida, Amaranthus, and
Albersia.[13] The support for the addition of the subdivision Albersia because of its circumcise, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehiscence_(botany)"] indehiscent
fruits coupled with three elliptic to linear [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepal"] tepals to be exclusive characters to members of this subgenus. The
classification of these groups are further supported with a combination of floral characters, reproductive
strategies, geographic distribution, and molecular evidence.[11][14][15]

The phylogenies of Amaranthus using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_parsimony_(phylogenetics)"] maximum parsimony and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference"] Bayesian analysis of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_gene"] nuclear and
 chloroplast [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene"] genes suggest five [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade"] clades within the genus: Diecious / Pumilus, Hybris, Galapagos, Eurasian/
South African, Australian (ESA), ESA + South American.[14]
Amaranthus includes three recognised subgenera and 75 species, although species numbers are
questionable due to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"] hybridisation and species concepts.[4] Infrageneric classification focuses on
inflorescence, flower characters and whether a species is monoecious/dioecious, as in the Sauer (1955)
suggested classification.[11] Bracteole morphology present on the stem is used for taxonomic classification
of Amaranth. Wild species have longer bracteoles compared to cultivated species.[12] A modified
infrageneric classification of Amaranthus includes three subgenera: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_tuberculatus"] Acnida, Amaranthus, and Albersia,
with the taxonomy further differentiated by sections within each of the subgenera.[16]
There is near certainty that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_hypochondriacus"] A. hypochondriacus is the common ancestor to the cultivated grain species,
however the later series of domestication to follow remains unclear. There has been opposing hypotheses of
a single as opposed to multiple domestication events of the three grain species.[11][17] There is evidence of
phylogenetic and geographical support for clear groupings that indicate separate domestication events in
South America and Central America.[11] A.  hybridus may derive from South America, whereas
A. caudatus, A. hypochondriacus, and A. quentiensis are native to Central and North America.[11][17]
Etymology
"Amaranth" derives from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek"] Greek ἀμάραντος[18] (amárantos),  "unfading",  with the Greek word for
"flower", ἄνθος (ánthos),  factoring into the word's development as amaranth, the unfading flower.
Amarant is an archaic variant. The name was first applied to the related [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celosia"] Celosia (Amaranthus and Celosia
share long-lasting dried flowers), as Amaranthus plants were not yet known in Europe.[19]

Ecology
Amaranth weed species have an extended period of germination, rapid growth, and high rates of seed
production,[2] and have been causing problems for farmers since the mid-1990s. This is partially due to the
reduction in tillage, reduction in herbicidal use and the evolution of herbicidal resistance in several species
where herbicides have been applied more often.[24] The following 9 species of Amaranthus are considered
invasive and noxious weeds in the U.S and Canada: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_albus"] A.  albus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_blitoides"] A.  blitoides, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_hybridus"] A.  hybridus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_palmeri"] A.  palmeri,
 A. powellii, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_retroflexus"] A. retroflexus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_spinosus"] A. spinosus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_tuberculatus"] A. tuberculatus, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_viridis"] A. viridis.[25][26]
Page 5
A new herbicide-resistant strain of A. palmeri has appeared; it is glyphosate-resistant and so cannot be
killed by herbicides using the chemical. Also, this plant can survive in tough conditions. The species
Amaranthus palmeri (Palmer amaranth) causes the greatest reduction in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean"] soybean yields and has the
potential to reduce yields by 17-68% in field experiments.[2] Palmer amaranth is among the "top five most
troublesome weeds" in the southeast of the United States and has already evolved resistances to
 dinitroaniline herbicides and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetolactate_synthase_inhibitor"] acetolactate synthase inhibitors.[27] This makes the proper identification of
Amaranthus species at the seedling stage essential for agriculturalists. Proper weed control needs to be
applied before the species successfully colonizes in the crop field and causes significant yield reductions.
An evolutionary lineage of around 90 species within the genus has acquired the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_carbon_fixation"] C4 carbon fixation
pathway, which increases their photosynthetic efficiency. This probably occurred in the Miocene.[28][29]

History
The native range of the genus is
cosmopolitan.[8] In pre-Hispanic
times, amaranth was cultivated by
the Aztec and their tributary
communities in a quantity very
similar to maize.[36] Known to
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztecs"] Aztecs as huāuhtli,[37]
amaranth is thought to have
represented up to 80% of their
energy consumption before the
 Spanish conquest. Another
important use of amaranth
throughout [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesoamerica"] Mesoamerica was in
ritual drinks and foods. To this
day, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranth_grain"] amaranth grains are toasted
much like popcorn and mixed
with honey, molasses, or
 chocolate to make a treat called
 alegría,  meaning "joy" in
Spanish.

While all species are believed to be native to the New World,
several have been cultivated and introduced to warm regions
worldwide. Amaranth's cosmopolitan distribution makes it one of
 many plants providing evidence of pre-Columbian oceanic
contact.[38][39] The earliest archeological evidence for amaranth in
the Old World was found in an excavation in Narhan, India, dated
to 1000–800 BCE.[40]
Because of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture, its
palatability, ease of cooking, and a protein that is particularly well-
suited to human nutritional needs, interest in amaranth seeds
(especially A.  cruentus and A.  hypochondriacus) revived in the
1970s. It was recovered in Mexico from wild varieties[41] and is
now commercially cultivated. It is a popular snack in Mexico,
sometimes mixed with chocolate or puffed rice, and its use has
spread to Europe and other parts of North America.

Several species are raised for amaranth "grain" in Asia and the
Americas. Amaranth and its relative [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoa"] quinoa are considered
 pseudocereals because of their similarities to cereals in flavor and
cooking. The spread of Amaranthus is of a joint effort of human
expansion, adaptation, and fertilization strategies. Grain amaranth
has been used for food by humans in several ways. The grain can
be ground into a flour for use like other grain flours. It can be
popped like popcorn, or flaked like oatmeal.[42]
 Seeds of Amaranth grain have been found in Antofagasta de la
Sierra Department, Catamarca, Argentina in the southern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puna_de_Atacama"] Puna
desert of the north of Argentina dating from 4,500 years ago, with
evidence suggesting earlier use.[7] Archeological evidence of seeds
from A.  hypochondriacus and A.  crutenus found in a cave in
Tehuacán, Mexico, suggests amaranth was part of Aztec
civilization in the 1400s.[43] 
Skull shapes made of amaranth and
honey for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead"] Day of the Dead in Mexico
Ancient amaranth grains still used include the three species
 Amaranthus caudatus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_cruentus"] A. cruentus, and A. hypochondriacus.[44]
 Evidence from single-nucleotide polymorphisms and chromosome
structure supports A. hypochondriacus as the common ancestor of
the three grain species.[45]
It has been proposed as an inexpensive native crop that could be
cultivated by indigenous people in rural areas for several reasons: 
Alegría, traditional Mexican candy
made with amaranth
A small amount of seed plants a large area (seeding rate 1 kg/ha).
Yields are high compared to the seeding rate: 1,000 kg or more per hectare.
It is easily harvested and easily processed, post harvest, as there are no hulls to remove.
Its seeds are a source of protein.[8][46]
It has rich content of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_mineral"] dietary minerals, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and
potassium.[47]
 In cooked and edible forms, amaranth retains adequate content of several dietary
minerals.[47]
It is easy to cook. Boil in water with twice the amount of water as grain by volume (or 2.4
times as much water by weight). Amaranth seed can also be popped one tablespoon at a
time in a hot pan without oil, shaken every few seconds to avoid burning.[48]
It grows fast and, in three cultivated species, the large seedheads can weigh up to 1 kg and
contain a half-million small seeds.[8]
In the United States, the amaranth crop is mostly used for seed production. Most amaranth in American
food products starts as a ground flour, blended with wheat or other flours to create cereals, crackers,
cookies, bread or other baked products. Despite utilization studies showing that amaranth can be blended
with other flours at levels above 50% without affecting functional properties or taste, most commercial
products use amaranth only as a minor portion of their ingredients despite them being marketed as
"amaranth" products.[49]
Leaves, roots, and stems
Page 8
Amaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf_vegetable"] leaf vegetable in many parts of the world. Four species
of Amaranthus are documented as cultivated vegetables in eastern Asia: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_cruentus"] Amaranthus cruentus,
 Amaranthus blitum, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_dubius"] Amaranthus dubius, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_tricolor"] Amaranthus tricolor.[50]
In Indonesia and Malaysia, leaf amaranth is called bayam (although the word has since been loaned to refer
to spinach, in a different genus[51]). In the Philippines, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilocano_language"] Ilocano word for the plant is kalunay; the
 Tagalog word for the plant is kilitis or kulitis. In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh"] Uttar Pradesh and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar"] Bihar in India, it is called chaulai and is
a popular red leafy vegetable (referred to in the class of vegetable preparations called laal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saag"] saag). It is called
chua in Kumaun area of Uttarakhand, where it is a popular red-green vegetable. In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka"] Karnataka in India, it is
called harive soppu (ಹರಿವೆ ಸೊಪ್ಪು) . It is used to prepare curries such as hulee, palya, majjigay-hulee, and
so on. In Kerala, it is called cheera and is consumed by stir-frying the leaves with spices and red chili
peppers to make a dish called cheera [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoran"] thoran. In Tamil Nadu, it is called mulaikkira and is regularly
consumed as a favourite dish, where the greens are steamed and mashed with light seasoning of salt, red
chili pepper, and cumin. It is called keerai masial. In the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and
other Telugu speaking regions of the country, this leaf is called as "Thotakura" and is cooked as a
standalone curry, added as a part of mix leafy vegetable curry or added in preparation of a popular [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dal"] dal
called thotakura pappu in (Telugu). In Maharashtra, it is called shravani maath and is available in both red
and white colour. In Orissa, it is called khada saga, it is used to prepare saga bhaja, in which the leaf is
fried with chili and onions.
In China, the leaves and stems are used as a stir-fry vegetable, or in soups. In Vietnam, it is called rau dền
and is used to make soup. Two species are popular as edible vegetable in Vietnam: dền đỏ (Amaranthus
tricolor) and dền cơm or dền trắng (Amaranthus viridis).
A traditional food plant in Africa, amaranth has the potential to improve nutrition, boost [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security"] food security,
foster rural development and support sustainable land care.[52]
In Bantu regions of Uganda and western Kenya, it is known as doodo or litoto.[53] It is also known among
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalenjin_people"] Kalenjin as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought"] drought crop (chepkerta). In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingala_language"] Lingala (spoken in the Congo), it is known as lɛngalɛnga or
bítɛkutɛku.[54] In Nigeria, it is a common vegetable and goes with all Nigerian starch dishes. It is known in
 Yoruba as shoko, a short form of shokoyokoto (meaning "make the husband fat"), or arowo jeja (meaning
"we have money left over for fish"). In the Caribbean, the leaves are called bhaji in Trinidad and callaloo
in Jamaica, and are sautéed with onions, garlic, and tomatoes, or sometimes used in a soup called pepperpot
soup. In Botswana, it is referred to as morug and cooked as a staple green vegetable.
In Greece, purple amaranth ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_blitum"] Amaranthus Blitum) is a popular dish called βλήτα, vlita or vleeta. It is boiled,
then served with olive oil and lemon juice like a salad, sometimes alongside fried fish. Greeks stop
harvesting the plant (which also grows wild) when it starts to bloom at the end of August.
In Brazil, green amaranth was, and to a degree still is, often considered an invasive species as all other
species of amaranth (except the generally imported A. caudatus cultivar), though some have traditionally
appreciated it as a leaf vegetable, under the names of caruru or bredo,  which is consumed cooked,
generally accompanying the staple food, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_and_beans"] rice and beans.
Oil
Making up about 5% of the total [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid"] fatty acids of amaranth, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squalene"] squalene[55] is extracted as a vegetable-based
alternative to the more expensive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_oil"] shark oil for use in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_supplements"] dietary supplements and cosmetics.[56]
Dyes
Page 9
The flowers of the 'Hopi Red Dye' amaranth were used by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi"] Hopi (a tribe in the western United States)
as the source of a deep red dye. Also a synthetic dye was named "amaranth" for its similarity in color to the
natural amaranth [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"] pigments known as betalains. This synthetic dye is also known as Red No. 2 in North
America and E123 in the European Union.[57]
Ornamentals
The genus also contains several well-known ornamental plants,
such as Amaranthus caudatus (love-lies-bleeding),  a vigorous,
 hardy annual with dark purplish [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower"] flowers crowded in handsome
drooping spikes. Another Indian annual, A.  hypochondriacus
(prince's feather), has deeply veined, lance-shaped leaves, purple
on the under face, and deep crimson flowers densely packed on
erect spikes.
Amaranths are recorded as food plants for some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepidoptera"] Lepidoptera
([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly"] butterfly and moth) species including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutmeg_(moth)"] nutmeg moth and various
case-bearer moths of the genus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleophora"] Coleophora: C.  amaranthella,
C.  enchorda (feeds exclusively on Amaranthus), C.  immortalis
(feeds exclusively on Amaranthus),  C.   lineapulvella,  and
C. versurella (recorded on A. spinosus).

In culture
 Diego Durán described the festivities for the Aztec god Huitzilopochtli. The Aztec month of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec_calendar"] Panquetzaliztli
(7 December to 26 December) was dedicated to Huitzilopochtli. People decorated their homes and trees
with paper flags; ritual races, processions, dances, songs, prayers, and finally [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sacrifice"] human sacrifices were held.
This was one of the more important Aztec festivals, and the people prepared for the whole month. They
fasted or ate very little; a statue of the god was made out of amaranth seeds and honey, and at the end of the
month, it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a piece of the god. After the Spanish conquest,
cultivation of amaranth was outlawed, while some of the festivities were subsumed into the Christmas
celebration.
Amaranth is associated with longevity and, poetically, with death and immortality.[58] Amaranth garlands
were used in the mourning of Achilles.[58][59]
 John Milton's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost"] Paradise Lost portrays a showy amaranth in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden"] Garden of Eden, "remov'd from Heav'n"
when it blossoms because the flowers "shade the fountain of life".[60] He describes amaranth as "immortal"
in reference to the flowers that generally do not wither and retain bright reddish tones of color, even when
deceased; referred to in one species as "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amaranthus_caudatus"] love-lies-bleeding."
