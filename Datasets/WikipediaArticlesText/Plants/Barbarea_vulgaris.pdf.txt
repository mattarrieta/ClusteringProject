Description
This [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"] plant grows to about 30–60 cm (12–24 in) high, with a
maximum of 1 m (3 ft 3 in). The stem is ribbed and hairless,
branched at the base. It has basal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosette_(botany)"] rosettes of shiny, dark green
leaves. The basal leaves are stalked and lyre-pinnatifid, that is
with a large terminal lobe and smaller lower lobes. The cauline
leaves are smaller, ovate, toothed, or lobed. The flowers are
borne in spring in dense terminal clusters above the foliage.
They are 7–9 mm (0.28–0.35 in) long, with four bright yellow
petals. The flowering period extends from about April through
July. The fruit is a pod around 15–30 mm (0.59–1.18 in).
Chemical substances in this species include saponins,[2][3][4][5]
flavonoids,[6] and glucosinolates.[7][8]

Taxonomy
Formally, B. vulgaris was first published and described by
 William Aiton in his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hortus_Kewensis"] 'Hortus Kewensis' Vol.4 on page 109 in
 1812. Some references still mention Robert Brown (Robert
Brown (botanist, born 1773)),[9] as the author. Indeed, botanists
believe that R. Brown was the actual author of the first botanical
description of B. vulgaris in the description of the family
 Brassicaceae (in Hortus Kew. ed. 2).[10] However, W. T. Aiton,
the publishing author, did not mention or indicate R. Brown's
name for Brassicaceae; therefore, W. T. Aiton is author of the
Brassicaceae novelties in this work. [11]
B. vulgaris has various common names of which the most
commonly used is 'wintercress' (e.g. Gleason, H.A. Illustrated
Flora of the NE United States and Adjacent Canada, 1952),
which can also be used for the entire genus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarea"] Barbarea. Many
other common names are listed in various sources, including (in
alphabetical order), 'cressy-greens', 'English wintercress', 'herb-
Barbaras', 'rocket cress', and 'yellow rocket'.[12] Two additional
names sometimes used, 'bittercress' and 'upland cress' are
ambiguous; the name 'bittercress' usually signifies various
species of the genus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardamine"] Cardamine,  and 'upland cress' usually
signifies [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarea_verna"] Barbarea verna.

Etymology 
Close-up on flowers of Barbarea vulgaris
The genus name [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarea"] Barbarea derives from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Barbara"] Saint Barbara, the
patron saint of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillerymen"] artillerymen and miners, as this plant in the past
was used to soothe the wounds caused by explosions.[13] The
species Latin name vulgaris means “common”.[14]
Natural insect resistance and its
potential use in agriculture 
Flowers with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melitaea_athalia"] heath fritillary
Most B. vulgaris genotypes are naturally resistant to some insect
species that are otherwise specialized on the crucifer family. In
the case of diamondback moth ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutella_xylostella"] Plutella xylostella) and the flea beetle [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllotreta_nemorum"] Phyllotreta nemorum, the resistance
is caused by saponins.[2][3][4][5] Glucosinolates such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Glucobarbarin&action=edit&redlink=1"] glucobarbarin and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucobrassicin"] glucobrassicin are used as a cue
for egg-laying by female cabbage white butterflies such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieris_rapae"] Pieris rapae. Indeed, the larvae of this butterfly
thrive well on this plant. Diamondback moth females are also stimulated by these chemicals, but the larvae
die due to the content of saponins which are apparently not sensed by the moths. This phenomenon has
been tested for biological insect control: B. vulgaris plants are placed in a field and attract much of the
diamondback moth egg load. As the larvae die shortly after hatching, this kind of insect control has been
named "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead-end_trap_cropping"] dead-end trap cropping".[15]

it is found in France, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal"] Portugal and Spain.[12]
Habitat
The plant prefers fresh or moist places, on roadsides, along rivers, in arable land, wastelands and
docklands, or on the slopes and in ditches, at an altitude of 0–2,500 m (0–8,202 ft) above sea level.[1]
It also prefers to grow in siliceous, calcareous, sandy, alluvial and clay soils.[1]
Natural chemotypes with distinct ecology
A pubescent type (the "P-type") has been described from southern Scandinavia and Russia. While this
chemotype is rare in Scandinavia, it seems to be dominant in Russia according to the only survey made so
far.[16] This type has atypical chemistry and is devoid of resistance to the diamondback moth and the flea
beetle Phyllotreta nemorum. The P-type belongs morphologically to the variety B. vulgaris var. arcuata,
but may also be identical to the variety originally described as Barbarea arcuata Rchb. var. pubescens N.
Busch. In this context, the usual type of B. vulgaris var. arcuata is called the "G-type" (for glabrous
(hairless) leaves). This type is reported to be dominant in Central Europe.[16] On a genomic scale, more
than 22.000 genes (89% of those tested) were found to have fixed differences between the two types.[17]
A chemotype with deviating glucosinolate content has been described from Western and Central Europe
and named the "NAS-type" (because it is dominated by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucosinolate"] glucosinolate glucoNASturtiin. This type has
increased resistance to some specialized insects. In this context, the usual chemotype of B. vulgaris is called
the "BAR" type (because it is dominated by glucoBARbarin).[18]
While the P-type and G-type differ in multiple genetic, chemical and morphological features, the NAS and
BAR types seem to be a simple monogenic variation.[18] For this reason, it has been suggested to refer to
NAS and BAR forms (from the lowest botanical rank forma) and P- and G-types. Indeed, occasional NAS
form plants in Central Europe were found to be G-type by a set of genetic markers.[19]
Uses

The young leaves can be eaten raw or cooked.[20] The buds and flowers are also edible.[21] It can also be
used as a dead-end [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_crop"] trap crop for diamondback moth, the caterpillar of which is a pest on cruciferous plants
like Cabbage.[22]
