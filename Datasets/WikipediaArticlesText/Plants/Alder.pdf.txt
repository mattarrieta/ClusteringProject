Alder
Alders are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"] trees comprising the genus Alnus in the birch [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"] family
Betulaceae. The genus comprises about 35 species[2] of
 monoecious [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree"] trees and shrubs, a few reaching a large size,
distributed throughout the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate_climate"] north temperate zone with a few
species extending into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"] Central America, as well as the northern
and southern Andes.[1]

Description
With a few exceptions, alders are deciduous, and the leaves are
alternate, simple, and serrated. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower"] flowers are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catkin"] catkins with
elongate male catkins on the same plant as shorter female
 catkins, often before leaves appear; they are mainly wind-
pollinated, but also visited by bees to a small extent. These trees

Fossils
 †[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alnus_heterodonta"] Alnus heterodonta (Newberry) Meyer & Manchester 1987 – Oligocene fossil, Oregon
Phylogeny
The oldest fossil pollen that can be identified as Alnus is from northern Bohemia, dating to the late
Paleocene, around 58 million years ago.[6]
Etymology
 The common name alder evolved from the Old English word alor, which in turn is derived from Proto-
Germanic root aliso.[7] The generic name Alnus is the equivalent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"] Latin name, from whence French aulne
and Spanish Alamo (Spanish term for "poplar").[7]
Ecology
Page 6
Alders are commonly found near streams, rivers, and wetlands. Sometimes where the prevalence of alders
 is particularly prominent these are called alder carrs. In the Pacific Northwest of North America, the white
alder (Alnus rhombifolia) unlike other northwest alders, has an affinity for warm, dry climates, where it
grows along watercourses, such as along the lower [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_River"] Columbia River east of the Cascades and the Snake
River, including Hells Canyon.
Alder leaves and sometimes catkins are used as food by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Lepidoptera_that_feed_on_alders"] numerous butterflies and moths.
A. glutinosa and A. viridis are classed as environmental weeds in New Zealand.[8] Alder leaves and
especially the roots are important to the ecosystem because they [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fixation"] enrich the soil with nitrogen and other
nutrients.
Nitrogen fixation and succession of woodland species
Alder is particularly noted for its important [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis"] symbiotic relationship with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankia_alni"] Frankia alni, an actinomycete,
filamentous, nitrogen-fixing bacterium. This bacterium is found in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_nodule"] root nodules, which may be as large as a
human fist, with many small lobes, and light brown in colour. The bacterium absorbs [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"] nitrogen from the air
and makes it available to the tree. Alder, in turn, provides the bacterium with sugars, which it produces
 through photosynthesis. As a result of this mutually beneficial relationship, alder improves the fertility of
the soil where it grows, and as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_species"] pioneer species, it helps provide additional nitrogen for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_succession"] successional
species to follow.
Because of its abundance, red alder delivers large amounts of
nitrogen to enrich forest soils. Red alder stands have been found to
supply between 130 to 320 kilograms per hectare (120 to 290
pounds per acre) of nitrogen annually to the soil. From Alaska to
Oregon, Alnus viridis subsp. sinuata (A. sinuata, Sitka Alder or
Slide Alder), characteristically pioneer fresh, gravelly sites at the
foot of retreating glaciers. Studies show that Sitka alder, a more
shrubby variety of alder, adds nitrogen to the soil at an average rate
of 60 kg/ha (54 lb/acre) per year, helping convert the sterile glacial
terrain to soil capable of supporting a conifer forest. Alders are
common among the first species to colonize disturbed areas from 
A red alder seed is a tiny [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samara_(fruit)"] samara like
those of all alders
floods, windstorms, fires, landslides, etc. Alder groves often serve
as natural firebreaks since these broad-leaved trees are much less flammable than conifers. Their foliage and
leaf litter does not carry a fire well, and their thin bark is sufficiently resistant to protect them from light
surface fires. In addition, the light weight of alder seeds – 1.5 million per kilogram or 680,000 per pound –
allows for easy dispersal by the wind. Although it outgrows [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Douglas-fir"] coastal Douglas-fir for the first 25 years, it is
very [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shade_tolerance"] shade intolerant and seldom lives more than 100 years. Red alder is the Pacific Northwest's largest
alder and the most plentiful and commercially important broad-leaved tree in the coastal Northwest. Groves
of red alder 25 to 50 centimetres (10 to 20 in) in diameter intermingle with young Douglas-fir forests west
of the Cascades, attaining a maximum height of 30 to 33 m (100 to 110 ft) in about sixty years and then are
afflicted by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rot"] heart rot. Alders largely help create conditions favorable for giant conifers that replace them.[2]

Parasites
Alder roots are parasitized by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boschniakia_rossica"] northern groundcone.
Uses
The catkins of some alder species have a degree of edibility,[9] and may be
rich in protein. Reported to have a bitter and unpleasant taste, they are more
useful for survival purposes. The wood of certain alder species is often used
to smoke various food items such as coffee, salmon, and other seafood.
Most of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_pilings"] pilings that form the foundation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice"] Venice were made from alder
trees.[10]
Alder bark contains the anti-inflammatory salicin, which is metabolized into
 salicylic acid in the body.[11] Some Native American cultures use red alder
bark ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alnus_rubra"] Alnus rubra) to treat poison oak, insect bites, and skin irritations.
Blackfeet Indians have traditionally used an infusion made from the bark of
red alder to treat lymphatic disorders and tuberculosis. Recent clinical studies
have verified that red alder contains [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betulin"] betulin and lupeol, compounds shown to
be effective against a variety of tumors.[12] 
Alder coat of arms of
Grossarl, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria"] Austria
 The inner bark of the alder, as well as red osier dogwood, or chokecherry, is used by some Indigenous
peoples of the Americas in smoking mixtures, known as kinnikinnick, to improve the taste of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearberry"] bearberry
leaf.[13]
Alder is illustrated in the coat of arms for the Austrian town of Grossarl.
Electric guitars, most notably those manufactured by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Musical_Instruments_Corporation"] Fender Musical Instruments Corporation, have
been built with alder bodies since the 1950s. Alder is appreciated for its tone that is claimed to be tight and
evenly balanced, especially when compared to mahogany, and has been adopted by many electric guitar
manufacturers.
As a hardwood, alder is used in making furniture, cabinets, and other woodworking products.
Alder bark and wood (like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak"] oak and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_chestnut"] sweet chestnut) contain [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannin"] tannin and are traditionally used to tan leather.
A red dye can also be extracted from the outer bark, and a yellow dye from the inner bark.[14]

Culture
 Ermanno Olmi's movie [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tree_of_Wooden_Clogs"] The Tree of Wooden Clogs (L' Albero Degli Zoccoli, 1978) refers in its title to alder,
typically used to make clogs as in this movie's plot.[15][16]
