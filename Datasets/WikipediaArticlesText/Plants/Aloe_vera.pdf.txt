Aloe vera ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈæloʊ(i) vɛrə,  vɪər-/)[3] is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succulent_plant"] succulent plant
 species of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"] genus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloe"] Aloe.[4] Having some 500 species, Aloe
is widely distributed, and is considered an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"] invasive species in
many world regions.[4][5] 
Aloe vera
 An evergreen perennial, it originates from the Arabian
Peninsula, but grows wild in tropical, semi-tropical, and arid
climates around the world.[4] It is cultivated for commercial
products, mainly as a  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_medication"] topical treatment used over
centuries.[4][5] The species is attractive for decorative
purposes, and succeeds indoors as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potted_plant"] potted plant.[6]
It is used in many consumer products, including beverages,
skin lotion, cosmetics, ointments or in the form of gel for
minor burns and sunburns. There is little [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine"] clinical evidence for
the effectiveness or safety of Aloe vera extract as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"] cosmetic
or topical drug.[5][7] The name derives from Latin as aloe and
vera ("true").

Etymology and common names
The botanical name derives from Latin, aloe (also from
Greek),  having uncertain origin, and vera ("true") from
Latin.[8] Common names use aloe with a region of its
distribution, such as Chinese aloe, Cape aloe or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados"] Barbados
aloe.[2][5][9][10]
Description
Aloe vera is a stemless or very short-stemmed plant growing
to 60–100 centimetres (24–39 inches) tall, spreading by
offsets.[4] The leaves are thick and fleshy, green to grey-
green, with some varieties showing white flecks on their
upper and lower stem surfaces.[11] The margin of the leaf is
 serrated and has small white teeth. The flowers are produced
in summer on a spike up to 90 cm (35 in) tall, each flower
being pendulous, with a yellow tubular [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corolla_(flower)"] corolla 2–3 cm
(3⁄4–11⁄4 in) long.[11][12] Like other Aloe species, Aloe vera
forms [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbuscular_mycorrhiza"] arbuscular mycorrhiza, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis"] symbiosis that allows the
plant better access to mineral nutrients in soil.[13]

such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emodin"] emodin and various lectins.[14][15]
Taxonomy  Teeth on the leaf edges
The species has several synonyms: A. barbadensis Mill.,  Aloe
indica Royle, Aloe perfoliata L. var. vera and A. vulgaris
Lam.[16][17] Some literature identifies the white-spotted form of
Aloe vera as Aloe vera var. chinensis;[18][19] and the spotted form
of Aloe vera may be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspecific"] conspecific with A. massawana.[20] The
species was first described by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus"] Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as Aloe
perfoliata var. vera,[21] and was described again in 1768 by
 Nicolaas Laurens Burman as Aloe vera in Flora Indica on 6 April
and by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Miller"] Philip Miller as Aloe barbadensis some ten days after
Burman in the Gardener's Dictionary.[22] 
Spotted forms, also named Aloe vera
var. chinensis
Techniques based on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"] DNA comparison suggest Aloe vera is
relatively closely related to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloe_perryi"] Aloe perryi,  a species endemic to
Yemen.[23] Similar techniques, using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroplast"] chloroplast DNA sequence comparison and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsatellite_(genetics)"] ISSR profiling have also
 suggested it is closely related to Aloe forbesii, Aloe inermis, Aloe scobinifolia, Aloe sinkatana, and Aloe
striata.[24] With the exception of the South African species A. striata, these Aloe species are native to
 Socotra (Yemen), Somalia, and Sudan.[24] The lack of obvious natural populations of the species has led
some authors to suggest Aloe vera may be of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"] hybrid origin.[25]
Distribution

 A. vera is considered to be native only to the south-east[26] Arabian
Peninsula in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hajar_Mountains"] Al Hajar Mountains in north-eastern Oman.[27]
However, it has been widely cultivated around the world, and has
become naturalized in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa"] North Africa, as well as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan"] Sudan and
neighboring countries, along with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_Islands"] Canary Islands, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Verde"] Cape Verde,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeira_Islands"] Madeira Islands.[16] It has also naturalized in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algarve"] Algarve
region of Portugal,[28][29] and in wild areas across southern Spain,
especially in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region_of_Murcia"] region of Murcia.[30]
The species was introduced to China and various parts of southern
Europe in the 17th century.[31] It is widely naturalized elsewhere,
occurring in arid, temperate, and tropical regions of temperate
continents.[4][27][32] The current distribution may be the result of
cultivation.[20][33]

Eruditorum, 1688
Cultivation
Aloe vera has been widely grown as an ornamental plant. The
 species is popular with modern gardeners as a topical medicinal
plant[34] and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This
succulence enables the species to survive in areas of low natural
rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use
gardens.[11] The species is hardy in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardiness_zone"] zones 8–11, and is intolerant of
heavy frost and snow.[12][35] The species is relatively resistant to
most insect pests, though [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider_mites"] spider mites, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mealy_bugs"] mealy bugs, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_insects"] scale insects,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphid"] aphid species may cause a decline in plant health.[36][37] This
 plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden
Merit.[38] 
As an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornamental_plant"] ornamental plant
In pots, the species requires well-drained, sandy potting soil and bright, sunny conditions. Aloe plants can
turn red from sunburn under too much direct sun, though gradual acclimation may help.[39] The use of a
good-quality commercial propagation mix or packaged "cacti and succulent mix" is recommended, as they
allow good drainage.[40] Terra cotta pots are preferable as they are porous.[40] Potted plants should be
allowed to completely dry before rewatering. When potted, aloes can become crowded with "pups"
growing from the sides of the "mother plant". Plants that have become crowded can be divided and
repotted to allow room for further growth, or the pups can be left with the mother plant.[39] During winter,
Aloe vera may become dormant, during which little moisture is required.[39] In areas that receive frost or
snow, the species is best kept indoors or in heated glasshouses.[12]Houseplants requiring similar care
include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haworthia"] haworthia and agave.[39]
There is large-scale agricultural production of Aloe vera in Australia,[41] Cuba, the Dominican Republic,
China, Mexico,[42] India,[43] Jamaica,[44] Spain, where it grows even well inland,[45] Kenya, Tanzania,
and South Africa,[46] along with the USA[47] to supply the cosmetics industry.[4]
Uses
Two substances from Aloe vera – a clear [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"] gel and its yellow [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex"] latex – are used to manufacture commercial
products.[7][34] Aloe gel typically is used to make [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_medication"] topical medications for skin conditions, such as burns,
wounds, frostbite, rashes, psoriasis, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_labialis"] cold sores, or dry skin.[7][34] Aloe latex is used individually or
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Horticultural_Society"]
Page 4
manufactured as a product with other ingredients to be ingested for relief of constipation.[7][34] Aloe latex
may be obtained in a dried form called resin or as "aloe dried juice".[48]
There is conflicting evidence regarding whether Aloe vera is effective as a treatment for wounds or
burns.[5][34] There is some evidence that topical use of aloe products might relieve symptoms of certain
skin disorders, such as psoriasis, acne, or rashes.[7][34]
Aloe vera [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gel"] gel is used commercially as an ingredient in yogurts, beverages, and some desserts,[49] but at
high or prolonged doses, ingesting aloe latex or whole leaf extract can be toxic.[7][5][10] Use of topical aloe
vera in small amounts is likely to be safe.[7][34]
Researchers also studying Aloe vera gel as a biodegradable electrolyte.[50]
Topical medication and potential side effects
 Aloe vera may be prepared as a lotion, gel, soap or cosmetics product for use on skin as a topical
medication.[5] For people with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"] allergies to Aloe vera, skin reactions may include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_dermatitis"] contact dermatitis with
 mild redness and itching, difficulty with breathing, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, or throat.[5][10]
Dietary supplement
Aloin, a compound found in the semi-liquid latex of some Aloe species, was the common ingredient in
 over-the-counter (OTC) laxative products in the United States until 2002 when the Food and Drug
Administration banned it because manufacturers failed to provide the necessary safety data.[7][5][51] Aloe
vera has potential toxicity, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effects"] side effects occurring at some dose levels both when ingested and when
applied topically.[5][10] Although toxicity may be less when aloin is removed by processing, Aloe vera
ingested in high amounts may induce side effects, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain"] abdominal pain, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"] diarrhea or hepatitis.[5][52]
Chronic ingestion of aloe (dose of 1 gram per day) may cause adverse effects, including hematuria, weight
loss, and cardiac or kidney disorders.[5]
Aloe vera juice is marketed to support the health of the digestive system, but there is neither scientific
evidence nor regulatory approval for this claim.[7][5][34] The extracts and quantities typically used for such
purposes are associated with toxicity in a dose-dependent way.[5][10]
Traditional medicine
Aloe vera is used in traditional medicine as a skin treatment. Early records of its use appear from the fourth
millennium BCE.[5] It is also written of in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juliana_Anicia_Codex"] Juliana Anicia Codex of 512 CE.[49]: 9 
Commodities
Aloe vera is used on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_tissue"] facial tissues where it is promoted as a moisturizer and anti-irritant to reduce chafing of
the nose. Cosmetic companies commonly add sap or other derivatives from Aloe vera to products such as
makeup, tissues, moisturizers, soaps, sunscreens, incense, shaving cream, or shampoos.[49] A review of
academic literature notes that its inclusion in many hygiene products is due to its "moisturizing emollient
effect".[15]
Toxicity
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloin"]
Page 5
 Orally ingested non-decolorized aloe vera leaf extract was listed by the California Office of Environmental
Health Hazard Assessment among "chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive
toxicity".[53]
Use of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topical_medication"] topical aloe vera is not associated with significant side effects.[7] Oral ingestion of aloe vera is
potentially toxic,[5] and may cause [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_cramps"] abdominal cramps and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea"] diarrhea which in turn can decrease the
absorption of drugs.[7]
Interactions with prescribed drugs
Ingested aloe products may have adverse [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_interaction"] interactions with prescription drugs, such as those used to treat
 blood clots, diabetes, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease"] heart disease and potassium-lowering agents (such as Digoxin), and diuretics, among
others.[34]
