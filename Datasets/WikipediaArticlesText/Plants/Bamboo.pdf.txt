Bamboo
 Bamboos are a diverse group of evergreen perennial flowering
plants in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subfamily_(biology)"] subfamily Bambusoideae of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass"] grass family
 Poaceae. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_bamboo"] Giant bamboos are the largest members of the grass
family. The origin of the word "bamboo" is uncertain, but it
probably comes from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_language"] Dutch or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language"] Portuguese language, which
originally borrowed it from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language"] Malay or Kannada.[3]

Temporal range: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ypresian"] Early Eocene -
 Present
In bamboo, as in other grasses, the internodal regions of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_stem"] stem
are usually hollow and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_bundle"] vascular bundles in the cross-section
are scattered throughout the stem instead of in a cylindrical
arrangement. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dicotyledon"] dicotyledonous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_plant"] woody [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylem"] xylem is also absent.
The absence of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_growth"] secondary growth wood causes the stems of
monocots, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecaceae"] palms and large bamboos, to be
columnar rather than tapering.[4]
Bamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants in the
world,[5] due to a unique rhizome-dependent system. Certain
species of bamboo can grow 91 centimetres (36 inches) within a
24-hour period, at a rate of almost 40 millimetres (11⁄2 in) an
hour (equivalent to 1 mm every 90 seconds).[6] This rapid
growth and tolerance for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_land"] marginal land, make bamboo a good
 candidate for afforestation, carbon sequestration and climate
change mitigation.
Bamboo is versatile and has notable economic and cultural
significance in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"] South Asia, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"] Southeast Asia, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"] East Asia, being
used for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_material"] building materials, as a food source, and as a raw
product, and depicted often in arts, such as in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_painting"] bamboo paintings
 and bambooworking. Bamboo, like wood, is a natural composite
material with a high strength-to-weight ratio useful for
structures.[7] Bamboo's strength-to-weight ratio is similar to
timber, and its strength is generally similar to a strong [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softwood"] softwood
or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardwood"] hardwood timber.[8][9]

Distribution
Most bamboo species are native to warm and moist tropical and to
warm temperate climates.[12] However, many species are found in
diverse climates, ranging from hot tropical regions to cool
mountainous regions and highland [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_forests"] cloud forests.
In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific"] Asia-Pacific region they occur across East Asia, from north
to 50 °N latitude in Sakhalin,[13] to south to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia"] northern Australia, and
west to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"] India and the Himalayas. China, Japan, Korea, India and
Australia, all have several endemic populations.[14] They also
occur in small numbers in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa"] sub-Saharan Africa, confined to tropical
areas, from southern Senegal in the north to southern Mozambique
and Madagascar in the south.[15] In the Americas, bamboo has a
native range from 47 °S in southern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina"] Argentina and the beech
forests of central Chile, through the South American tropical
rainforests, to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes"] Andes in Ecuador near 4,300 m (14,000 ft).
Bamboo is also native through [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America"] Central America and Mexico,
northward into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States"] Southeastern United States.[16] Canada and
continental Europe are not known to have any native species of
bamboo.[17] As garden plants, many species grow readily outside
these ranges, including most of Europe and the United States.

Ecology
The two general patterns for the growth of bamboo are "clumping", and "running", with short and long
underground rhizomes, respectively. Clumping bamboo species tend to spread slowly, as the growth pattern
of the rhizomes is to simply expand the root mass gradually, similar to ornamental grasses. "Running"
bamboos, though, need to be controlled during cultivation because of their potential for aggressive
behavior. They spread mainly through their rhizomes, which can spread widely underground and send up
new culms to break through the surface. Running bamboo species are highly variable in their tendency to
Page 7
spread; this is related to both the species and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil"] soil and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate"] climate
conditions. Some can send out runners of several meters a year,
while others can stay in the same general area for long periods. If
neglected, over time, they can cause problems by moving into
adjacent areas.
Bamboos include some of the fastest-growing plants on Earth, with
reported growth rates up to 910 mm (36 in) in 24 hours.[6]
However, the growth rate is dependent on local soil and climatic
conditions, as well as species, and a more typical growth rate for
many commonly cultivated bamboos in temperate climates is in the
range of 30–100 mm (1–4 in) per day during the growing period.
Primarily growing in regions of warmer climates during the late
 Cretaceous period, vast fields existed in what is now Asia. Some of
the largest timber bamboo can grow over 30 m (100 ft) tall, and be
as large as 250–300 mm (10–12 in) in diameter. However, the size
range for mature bamboo is species-dependent, with the smallest
bamboos reaching only several inches high at maturity. A typical
height range that would cover many of the common bamboos
grown in the United States is 4.5–12 m (15–39 ft), depending on
species. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anji_County"] Anji County of China, known as the "Town of Bamboo",
provides the optimal climate and soil conditions to grow, harvest,
and process some of the most valued bamboo poles available
worldwide. 
Closeup of bamboo stalk
Bamboo canopy
Unlike all trees, individual bamboo [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culm_(botany)"] culms emerge from the ground at their full diameter and grow to their
full height in a single [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_season"] growing season of three to four months. During this time, each new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot"] shoot grows
vertically into a culm with no branching out until the majority of the mature height is reached. Then, the
branches extend from the nodes and leafing out occurs. In the next year, the pulpy wall of each culm slowly
hardens. During the third year, the culm hardens further. The shoot is now a fully mature culm. Over the
next 2–5 years (depending on species), fungus begins to form on the outside of the culm, which eventually
penetrates and overcomes the culm. Around 5–8 years later (species- and climate-dependent), the fungal
growths cause the culm to collapse and decay. This brief life means culms are ready for harvest and suitable
for use in construction within about three to seven years. Individual bamboo culms do not get any taller or
larger in diameter in subsequent years than they do in their first year, and they do not replace any growth
lost from pruning or natural breakage. Bamboo has a wide range of hardiness depending on species and
locale. Small or young specimens of an individual species produce small culms initially. As the clump and
its rhizome system mature, taller and larger culms are produced each year until the plant approaches its
particular species limits of height and diameter.
Many tropical bamboo species die at or near freezing temperatures, while some of the hardier temperate
bamboos can survive temperatures as low as −29 °C (−20 °F). Some of the hardiest bamboo species can be
grown in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardiness_zone"] USDA plant hardiness zone 5, although they typically defoliate and may even lose all above-
ground growth, yet the rhizomes survive and send up shoots again the next spring. In milder climates, such
as USDA zone 7 and above, most bamboo remain fully leafed out and green year-round.
Mass flowering
Bamboos seldom and unpredictably flower and the frequency of flowering varies greatly from species to
species. Once flowering takes place, a plant declines and often dies entirely. In fact, many species only
flower at intervals as long as 65 or 120 years. These taxa exhibit [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_flowering"] mass flowering (or gregarious flowering),
Page 8
with all plants in a particular 'cohort' flowering over a several-year period.
Any plant derived through clonal propagation from this cohort will also
flower regardless of whether it has been planted in a different location. The
longest mass flowering interval known is 130 years, and it is for the species
 Phyllostachys bambusoides (Sieb. & Zucc.). In this species, all plants of the
same stock flower at the same time, regardless of differences in geographic
locations or climatic conditions, and then the bamboo dies. The lack of
environmental impact on the time of flowering indicates the presence of
some sort of "alarm clock" in each cell of the plant which signals the
diversion of all energy to flower production and the cessation of vegetative
growth.[20] This mechanism, as well as the evolutionary cause behind it, is
still largely a mystery. 
Flowering bamboo
One hypothesis to explain the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"] evolution of this [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semelparous"] semelparous mass flowering
is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predator_satiation"] predator satiation hypothesis, which argues that by fruiting at the
same time, a population increases the survival rate of its seeds by flooding
the area with fruit, so even if predators eat their fill, seeds will still be left
over. By having a flowering cycle longer than the lifespan of the rodent
predators, bamboos can regulate animal populations by causing starvation
during the period between flowering events. Thus, the death of the adult
clone is due to resource exhaustion, as it would be more effective for parent
plants to devote all resources to creating a large seed crop than to hold back
energy for their own regeneration.[21]
Another, the fire cycle hypothesis, states that periodic flowering followed
by death of the adult plants has evolved as a mechanism to create
disturbance in the habitat, thus providing the seedlings with a gap in which
to grow. This argues that the dead culms create a large fuel load,
and also a large target for lightning strikes, increasing the likelihood
of wildfire.[22] Because bamboos can be aggressive as early
successional plants, the seedlings would be able to outstrip other
plants and take over the space left by their parents. 
 Phyllostachys glauca

However, both have been disputed for different reasons. The
predator satiation hypothesis does not explain why the flowering
cycle is 10 times longer than the lifespan of the local rodents,
something not predicted. The bamboo fire cycle hypothesis is
considered by a few scientists to be unreasonable; they argue[23]
that fires only result from humans and there is no natural fire in
India. This notion is considered wrong based on distribution of
lightning strike data during the dry season throughout India.
However, another argument against this is the lack of precedent for
any living organism to harness something as unpredictable as
lightning strikes to increase its chance of survival as part of natural
evolutionary progress.[24]
More recently, a mathematical explanation for the extreme length of
 the flowering cycles has been offered, involving both the stabilising
selection implied by the predator satiation hypothesis and others,
and the fact that plants that flower at longer intervals tend to release Bunches of bamboo seeds
more seeds.[25][26] The hypothesis claims that bamboo flowering
intervals grew by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer"] integer multiplication. A mutant bamboo plant flowering at a noninteger multiple of its
Page 9
population's flowering interval would release its seeds alone, and would not enjoy the benefits of collective
flowering (such as protection from predators). However, a mutant bamboo plant flowering at an integer
multiple of its population's flowering interval would release its seeds only during collective flowering
events, and would release more seeds than the average plant in the population. It could, therefore, take over
the population, establishing a flowering interval that is an integer multiple of the previous flowering
interval. The hypothesis predicts that observed bamboo flowering intervals should factorize into small
 prime numbers.
The mass fruiting also has direct economic and ecological consequences, however. The huge increase in
available fruit in the forests often causes a boom in rodent populations, leading to increases in disease and
famine in nearby human populations. For example, devastating consequences occur when the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melocanna"] Melocanna
bambusoides population flowers and fruits once every 30–35 years[27] around the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal"] Bay of Bengal. The
 death of the bamboo plants following their fruiting means the local people lose their building material; and
the large increase in bamboo fruit leads to a rapid increase in rodent populations. As the number of rodents
increases, they consume all available food, including grain fields and stored food, sometimes leading to
famine. These rats can also carry dangerous diseases, such as typhus, typhoid, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague"] bubonic plague, which
can reach epidemic proportions as the rodents increase in number.[20][21] The relationship between rat
populations and bamboo flowering was examined in a 2009 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_(American_TV_program)"] Nova documentary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NOVA_episodes#Season_36:_2008%E2%80%932009"] "Rat Attack".
In any case, flowering produces masses of seeds, typically suspended from the ends of the branches. These
seeds give rise to a new generation of plants that may be identical in appearance to those that preceded the
flowering, or they may produce new cultivars with different characteristics, such as the presence or absence
of striping or other changes in coloration of the culms.
Several bamboo species are never known to set seed even when sporadically flowering has been reported.
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambusa_vulgaris"] Bambusa vulgaris,  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambusa_balcooa"] Bambusa balcooa,  and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dendrocalamus_stocksii&action=edit&redlink=1"] Dendrocalamus stocksii are common examples of such
bamboo.[28]
Invasive species
Some bamboo species are acknowledged as having high potential for becoming [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasive_species"] invasive species. A study
commissioned by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bamboo_and_Rattan_Organisation"] International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation, found that invasive species typically are
varieties that spread via [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhizome"] rhizomes rather than by clumping, as most commercially viable woody bamboos
do.[29] Certain bamboos have become problematic, such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllostachys"] Phyllostachys species of bamboo which are
considered invasive and illegal to sell or propagate in some areas of the US. There are approximately 61
species of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllostachys"] Phyllostachys.[30]
Animal diet
Soft [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_shoot"] bamboo shoots, stems and leaves are the major food source of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda"] giant panda of China, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_panda"] red panda
of Nepal, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_lemur"] bamboo lemurs of Madagascar. Rats eat the fruits as described above. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_gorilla"] Mountain gorillas
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Africa"] Central Africa also feed on bamboo, and have been documented consuming bamboo [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sap"] sap which was
 fermented and alcoholic;[15] chimpanzees and elephants of the region also eat the stalks. The golden
bamboo lemur ingests many times the quantity of the taxiphyllin-containing bamboo that would kill a
human.
The larvae of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_borer"] bamboo borer (the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moth"] moth [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphisa_fuscidentalis"] Omphisa fuscidentalis) of Laos, Myanmar, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"] Thailand and
 Yunnan, China feed off the pulp of live bamboo. In turn, these [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar"] caterpillars are considered a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomophagy"] local delicacy.
Cultivation
Page 10
General
 Bamboo forestry (also known as bamboo farming, cultivation, agriculture
or agroforestry) is a cultivation and raw material industry that provides the
raw materials for the broader bamboo industry, worth over 72 billion
dollars globally in 2019.[31]
Historically, a dominant raw material in South and South East Asia, the
global bamboo industry has significantly grown in recent decades in part
because of the high sustainability of bamboo as compared to other biomass
cultivation strategies, such as traditional timber forestry. For example, as of
2016, the U.S. Fiber corporation [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Resource_Fiber&action=edit&redlink=1"] Resource Fiber is contracting farmers in
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Industrial_Development_Organization"] the United States for bamboo cultivation.[32][31] Or in 2009, United
Nations Industrial Development Organization published guidelines for
cultivation of bamboo in semi-arid climates in Ethiopia and Kenya.[33] 
Bamboo is the main food of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda"] giant panda, making up
99% of its diet.

Because bamboo can grow on otherwise [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_land"] marginal land, bamboo can be profitably cultivated in many
 degraded lands.[34][35] Moreover, because of the rapid growth, bamboo is an effective climate change
mitigation and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_sequestration"] carbon sequestration crop, absorbing between 100 and 400 tonnes of carbon per
hectare.[36][37] In 1997, an international intergovernmental organization was established to promote the
development of bamboo cultivation, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Bamboo_and_Rattan_Organisation"] International Bamboo and Rattan Organisation.[38]
Page 11
Bamboo is harvested from both cultivated and wild stands, and some of the larger bamboos, particularly
species in the genus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllostachys"] Phyllostachys, are known as "timber bamboos". Bamboo is typically harvested as a
source material for construction, food, crafts and other manufactured goods.[39]
Bamboo cultivation in South, South East Asia and East Asia stretches back thousands of years. One
practice, in South Korea, has been designated as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_Important_Agricultural_Heritage_Systems"] Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems.
Harvesting
Bamboo used for construction purposes must be harvested when the culms reach their greatest strength and
when sugar levels in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sap"] sap are at their lowest, as high sugar content increases the ease and rate of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(organism)"] pest
infestation. As compared to forest trees, bamboo species grow fast. Bamboo plantations can be readily
harvested for a shorter period than tree plantations.[40]
Harvesting of bamboo is typically undertaken according to these cycles:
Lifecycle of the culm: As each individual [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culm_(botany)"] culm goes through a 5- to 7-year lifecycle, culms
are ideally allowed to reach this level of maturity prior to full capacity harvesting. The
clearing out or thinning of culms, particularly older decaying culms, helps to ensure
adequate light and resources for new growth. Well-maintained clumps may have a
productivity three to four times that of an unharvested wild clump. Consistent with the
lifecycle described above, bamboo is harvested from two to three years through to five to
seven years, depending on the species.
Annual cycle: As all growth of new bamboo occurs during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season"] wet season, disturbing the
clump during this phase will potentially damage the upcoming crop. Also during this high-
rainfall period, sap levels are at their highest, and then diminish towards the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_season"] dry season.
Picking immediately prior to the wet/growth season may also damage new shoots. Hence,
harvesting is best a few months prior to the start of the wet season.
Daily cycle: During the height of the day, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis"] photosynthesis is at its peak, producing the
highest levels of sugar in sap, making this the least ideal time of day to harvest. Many
traditional practitioners believe the best time to harvest is at dawn or dusk on a waning
moon.
Leaching
Leaching is the removal of sap after harvest. In many areas of the world, the sap levels in harvested
bamboo are reduced either through leaching or postharvest photosynthesis.For example:
Cut bamboo is raised clear of the ground and leaned against the rest of the clump for one to
two weeks until leaves turn yellow to allow full consumption of sugars by the plant.
A similar method is undertaken, but with the base of the culm standing in fresh water, either
in a large drum or stream to leach out sap.
Cut culms are immersed in a running stream and weighted down for three to four weeks.
Water is pumped through the freshly cut culms, forcing out the sap (this method is often used
in conjunction with the injection of some form of treatment).
In the process of water leaching, the bamboo is dried slowly and evenly in the shade to avoid cracking in
the outer skin of the bamboo, thereby reducing opportunities for pest infestation.
Page 12
Durability of bamboo in construction is directly related to how well it is handled from the moment of
planting through harvesting, transportation, storage, design, construction, and maintenance. Bamboo
harvested at the correct time of year and then exposed to ground contact or rain will break down just as
quickly as incorrectly harvested material.[41]
Toxicity
Gardeners working with bamboo plants have occasionally reported [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_response"] allergic reactions varying from no
effects during previous exposures, to immediate itchiness and rash developing into red welts after several
hours where the skin had been in contact with the plant ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_dermatitis"] contact allergy), and in some cases into swollen
eyelids and breathing difficulties (dyspnoea). A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_allergy_test"] skin prick test using bamboo extract was positive for the
 immunoglobulin E (IgE) in an available case study.[42][43][44]
The shoots (newly emerged culms) of bamboo contain the toxin taxiphyllin (a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanogenic_glycoside"] cyanogenic glycoside),
which produces [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanide"] cyanide in the gut.[45]
Uses
Culinary
The shoots of most species are edible either raw or cooked, with
the tough sheath removed. Cooking removes the slight
bitterness.[46] The shoots are used in numerous Asian dishes and
broths, and are available in supermarkets in various sliced forms, in
both fresh and canned versions.
The bamboo shoot in its fermented state forms an important
ingredient in cuisines across the Himalayas. In Assam, India, for
example, it is called khorisa.[47] In Nepal, a delicacy popular across
ethnic boundaries consists of bamboo shoots fermented with
turmeric and oil, and cooked with potatoes into a dish that usually
accompanies rice (alu tama[48] (आलु तामा) in Nepali). 
Unprocessed bamboo shoots in a
Japanese market
In Indonesia, they are sliced thin and then boiled with santan (thick
coconut milk) and spices to make a dish called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gulai_rebung&action=edit&redlink=1"] gulai rebung. Other
recipes using bamboo shoots are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayur_lodeh"] sayur lodeh (mixed vegetables in
coconut milk) and lun pia (sometimes written [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumpia"] lumpia:  fried
wrapped bamboo shoots with vegetables).  The shoots of some
species contain toxins that need to be leached or boiled out before
they can be eaten safely. 
Korean bamboo tea
Pickled bamboo, used as a condiment, may also be made from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pith"] pith of the young shoots.
The sap of young stalks tapped during the rainy season may be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation_(wine)"] fermented to make ulanzi [49](a sweet wine)
or simply made into a soft drink.[50] Bamboo leaves are also used as wrappers for steamed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zongzi"] dumplings
which usually contains glutinous rice and other ingredients, such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zongzi"] zongzi from China.
Pickled bamboo shoots (Nepali: तामा tama) are cooked with black-eyed beans as a delicacy in Nepal.
Many Nepalese restaurants around the world serve this dish as aloo bodi tama. Fresh bamboo shoots are
sliced and pickled with mustard seeds and turmeric and kept in glass jar in direct sunlight for the best taste.

 fermented to prepare kardi.
The name is derived from
the Sanskrit word for
bamboo shoot, karira. This
fermented bamboo shoot is
used in various culinary
preparations, notably amil,
a sour vegetable soup. It is
also made into pancakes using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_flour"] rice flour as a binding agent.[51] The
shoots that have turned a little fibrous are fermented, dried, and
ground to sand-sized particles to prepare a garnish known as
hendua. It is also cooked with tender pumpkin leaves to make sag
green leaves.
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konkani_people"] Konkani cuisine, the tender shoots (kirlu) are grated and cooked with crushed jackfruit seeds to prepare
kirla sukke.
In southern India and some regions of southwest China, the seeds of the dying bamboo plant are consumed
as a grain known as "bamboo rice". The taste of cooked bamboo seeds is reported to be similar to wheat
and the appearance similar to rice, but bamboo seeds have been found to have lower nutrient levels than
both.[52] The seeds can be pulverized into a flour with which to make cakes.[46]
The Indian state of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikkim"] Sikkim has promoted bamboo water bottles to keep the state free from plastic bottles [53]
The empty hollow in the stalks of larger bamboo is often used to cook food in many Asian cultures. Soups
are boiled and rice is cooked in the hollows of fresh stalks of bamboo directly over a flame. Similarly,
steamed tea is sometimes rammed into bamboo hollows to produce [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_tea"] compressed forms of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu-erh_tea"] Pu-erh tea.
Cooking food in bamboo is said to give the food a subtle but distinctive taste.
Bamboo [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcoal"] charcoal is charcoal made from species of bamboo.
Bamboo charcoal is typically made from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culm_(botany)"] culms or refuse of
mature bamboo plants and burned in ovens at temperatures
ranging from 600 to 1200 °C. It is an especially porous
 charcoal, making it useful in the manufacture of activated
carbon. [54]
Bamboo charcoal has a long Chinese history, with documents
dating as early as 1486 during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty"] Ming dynasty in
 Chuzhou.[55] There is also mention of it during the Qing
dynasty, during the reigns of emperors Kangxi, Qianlong, and
Guangxu.[56]

Bambooworking
Bamboo was used by humans for various purposes from a very early time. Categories of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambooworking"] bambooworking
include:
Writing surface
Bamboo was in widespread use in early China as a medium for written documents. The earliest surviving
examples of such documents, written in ink on string-bound bundles of bamboo strips (or "slips"), date
from the 5th century BC during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warring_States_period"] Warring States period. However, references in earlier texts surviving on
other media make it clear that some precursor of these Warring States period bamboo slips was in use as
early as the late [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang"] Shang period (from about 1250 BC).
Bamboo or wooden strips were used as the standard writing material during the early [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty"] Han dynasty, and
excavated examples have been found in abundance.[57] Subsequently, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_paper"] paper began to displace bamboo and
wooden strips from mainstream uses, and by the 4th century AD, bamboo slips had been largely
abandoned as a medium for writing in China.
Bamboo fiber has been used to make paper in China since early times. A high-quality, handmade bamboo
paper is still produced in small quantities. Coarse bamboo paper is still used to make [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_paper"] spirit money in many
Chinese communities.[58]
 Bamboo pulps are mainly produced in China, Myanmar, Thailand, and India, and are used in printing and
writing papers.[59] Several paper industries are surviving on bamboo forests. Ballarpur (Chandrapur,
Maharstra) paper mills use bamboo for paper production. The most common bamboo species used for
paper are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrocalamus_asper"] Dendrocalamus asper and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambusa_blumeana"] Bambusa blumeana. It is also possible to make [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolving_pulp"] dissolving pulp from
bamboo. The average fiber length is similar to hardwoods, but the properties of bamboo pulp are closer to
 softwood pulps due to it having a very broad fiber length distribution.[59] With the help of molecular tools,
it is now possible to distinguish the superior fiber-yielding species/varieties even at juvenile stages of their
growth, which can help in unadulterated merchandise production.[60]
In Central India, there are regular bamboo working circles in forest areas of Maharashtra, Madhyapradesh,
Odisha and Chhattisgarh. Most of the bamboo is harvested for papermaking. Bamboo is cut after three
years of its germination. No cutting is done during the rainy season (July–September); broken and
malformed culms are harvested first.[61]zzzzz
Writing pen
In olden times, people in India used hand-made pens (known as Kalam or boru (बोरू)) made from thin
bamboo sticks (with diameters of 5–10 mm and lengths of 100–150 mm) by simply peeling them on one
side and making a nib-like pattern at the end. The pen would then be dipped in ink for writing.[62]
Textiles
Since the fibers of bamboo are very short (less than 3 mm or 1⁄8 in), they are not usually transformed into
yarn by a natural process. The usual process by which textiles labeled as being made of bamboo are
produced uses only [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayon"] rayon made from the fibers with heavy employment of chemicals. To accomplish this,
the fibers are broken down with chemicals and extruded through mechanical spinnerets; the chemicals
include lye, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_disulfide"] carbon disulfide, and strong acids.[63] Retailers have sold both end products as "bamboo
fabric" to cash in on bamboo's current ecofriendly cachet; however, the Canadian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_Bureau"] Competition Bureau[64]
Page 15
and the US [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission"] Federal Trade Commission,[65] as of mid-2009, are cracking down on the practice of labeling
bamboo rayon as natural bamboo fabric. Under the guidelines of both agencies, these products must be
labeled as rayon with the optional qualifier "from bamboo".[65]
Fabric
 Bamboo textile is any cloth, yarn or clothing made from bamboo fibres.
While historically used only for structural elements, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bustle"] bustles and the
ribs of corsets, in recent years different technologies have been developed
that allow bamboo fibre to be used for a wide range of textile and fashion
applications.
Examples include clothing such as shirt tops, pants, socks for adults and
children as well as bedding[66] such as sheets and pillow covers. Bamboo
yarn can also be blended with other textile fibres such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp"] hemp or spandex.
Bamboo is an alternative to plastic that is renewable and can be replenished
at a fast rate.
Modern clothing labeled as being made from bamboo is usually viscose
rayon, a fiber made by dissolving the cellulose in the bamboo, and then
extruding it to form fibres. This process removes the natural characteristics
of bamboo fibre, rendering it identical to rayon from other cellulose
sources.

Construction
Bamboo, like true wood, is a natural [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_material"] building material with a high strength-to-weight ratio useful for
structures.[7] In its natural form, bamboo as a construction material is traditionally associated with the
cultures of South Asia, East Asia, and the South Pacific, to some extent in Central and South America, and
by extension in the aesthetic of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiki_culture"] Tiki culture.
 In China and India, bamboo was used to hold up simple suspension
bridges, either by making cables of split bamboo or twisting whole
culms of sufficiently pliable bamboo together. One such bridge in
the area of Qian-Xian is referenced in writings dating back to 960
AD and may have stood since as far back as the third century BC,
due largely to continuous maintenance.Bamboo has also long been
used as scaffolding; the practice has been banned in China for
buildings over six stories, but is still in continuous use for
skyscrapers in Hong Kong.[67]
In the Philippines, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipa_hut"] nipa hut is a fairly typical example of the
most basic sort of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House"] housing where bamboo is used; the walls are split
and woven bamboo, and bamboo slats and poles may be used as its
support. 
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_An_Tai_Historical_House_and_Museum"] Bamboo-style barred window in Lin
An Tai Historical House, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipei"] Taipei
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_architecture"] Japanese architecture, bamboo is used primarily as a supplemental or decorative element in buildings
such as fencing, fountains, grates, and gutters, largely due to the ready abundance of quality timber.[68]
Many ethnic groups in remote areas that have water access in Asia use bamboo that is 3–5 years old to
make rafts. They use 8 to 12 poles, 6–7 m (20–23 ft) long, laid together side by side to a width of about
1 m (3 ft). Once the poles are lined up together, they cut a hole crosswise through the poles at each end and

Bamboo has often been used to construct weapons and is still incorporated in several Asian martial arts.
A bamboo staff, sometimes with one end sharpened, is used in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamils"] Tamil martial art of
 silambam, a word derived from a term meaning "hill bamboo".
Staves used in the Indian martial art of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatka"] gatka are commonly made from bamboo, a material
favoured for its light weight.
A bamboo sword called a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinai"] shinai is used in the Japanese martial art of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendo"] kendo.
Bamboo is used for crafting the bows, called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yumi"] yumi, and arrows used in the Japanese martial
art [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%ABd%C5%8D"] kyūdō.
The first gunpowder-based weapons, such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_lance"] fire lance, were made of bamboo.
Sharpened bamboo [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javelin"] javelins weighted with sand known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagakay"] bagakay were used as
disposable missile weapons in both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangayaw"] land and naval warfare in the Philippines. They were
thrown in groups at a time at enemy ships or massed enemy formations. Non-disposable
finely-crafted throwing spears made from bamboo weighted with sand known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sugob&action=edit&redlink=1"] sugob were
also used. Sugob were mainly used for close-quarters combat and were only thrown when
they could be retrieved.[69][70]
Metal-tipped blowgun-spears called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumpit"] sumpit (or sumpitan), used by various ethnic groups in

 Shaanxi province to support his geological theory of gradual [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_variability_and_change"] climate change.[74][75]
Kitchenware and other usage
Bamboo is frequently used for cooking
utensils within many cultures, and is used in
the manufacture of chopsticks. In modern
times, some see bamboo tools as an eco-
friendly alternative to other manufactured
utensils.
Bamboo broom 
Bamboo is also used to make eating utensils
such as chopsticks, trays, and tea scoops.
 Several manufacturers offer bamboo
bicycles, surfboards, snowboards, and

millennia-long tradition, and bamboo is also used for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_floor"] floors due to its high hardness.[80]
In culture
Several Asian cultures, including that of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andaman_Islands"] Andaman Islands, believe humanity emerged from a bamboo
stem.
China
Bamboo's long life makes it a Chinese symbol of uprightness and an Indian symbol of friendship. The
rarity of its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo_blossom"] blossoming has led to the flowers' being regarded as a sign of impending famine. This may be
due to rats feeding upon the profusion of flowers, then multiplying and destroying a large part of the local

food supply. The most recent flowering began in May 2006 (see
Mautam). Bamboo is said to bloom in this manner only about every
 50 years (see 28–60 year examples in FAO: 'gregarious' species
table (http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/docre

 Bamboo, one of the "Four
Gentlemen" (bamboo, orchid, plum
blossom and chrysanthemum),
plays such an important role in
traditional Chinese culture that it is
even regarded as a behavior model
of the gentleman. As bamboo has
features such as uprightness,
tenacity, and modesty, people
endow bamboo with integrity,
elegance, and plainness, though it is

poems praising bamboo written by
ancient Chinese poets are actually
metaphorically about people who
exhibited these characteristics. An
ancient poet, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bai_Juyi"] Bai Juyi (772–846),
thought that to be a gentleman, a
man does not need to be physically strong, but he must be mentally
strong, upright, and perseverant. Just as a bamboo is hollow-
hearted, he should open his heart to accept anything of benefit and
never have arrogance or prejudice.

Bamboo is not only a symbol of a gentleman, but also plays an
important role in Buddhism, which was introduced into China in
the first century. As canons of Buddhis
筍m forbids cruelty to animals, flesh and egg were not allowed in the
diet. The tender bamboo shoot (sǔn  in Chinese) thus became a nutritious alternative. Preparation
methods developed over thousands of years have come to be incorporated into Asian cuisines, especially
for monks. A Buddhist monk, Zan Ning, wrote a manual of the bamboo shoot called Sǔn Pǔ (
筍譜)
offering descriptions and recipes for many kinds of bamboo shoots.[81] Bamboo shoot has always been a
traditional dish on the Chinese dinner table, especially in southern China.In ancient times, those who could
afford a big house with a yard would plant bamboo in their garden.
Mythology

In a Chinese legend, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yao"] Emperor Yao gave two of his daughters to the future [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shun"] Emperor Shun as a test for
his potential to rule. Shun passed the test of being able to run his household with the two emperor's
daughters as wives, and thus Yao made Shun his successor, bypassing his unworthy son. After Shun's
death, the tears of his two bereaved wives fell upon the bamboos growing there explains the origin of
 spotted bamboo. The two women later became goddesses [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangshuishen"] Xiangshuishen after drowning themselves in the

Japan
The "Three Friends of Winter" known as Kansai Sanyū in Japanese is traditionally used as a system of
ranking in Japan. This system is used in many traditional arts like with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushi"] sushi sets, embroidering kimono or
accommodations at a traditional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryokan_(inn)"] ryokan taverns. Pine (matsu 
松 in Japanese) is of the first rank, bamboo
(take 
竹) is of second rank, and plum (ume 
梅) is of the third. The plant itself is also a symbol of prosperity
in the East Asian State.
Attributions of character
In Japan, a bamboo forest sometimes surrounds a Shinto [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(Shinto)"] shrine as part of a sacred barrier against evil.
Many Buddhist temples also have bamboo groves.

Malaysia
In Malaysia, a similar story includes a man who dreams of a beautiful woman while sleeping under a

Bamboo plays an important part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Vietnam"] culture of Vietnam. Bamboo symbolizes the spirit of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vovinam"] Vovinam (a
Vietnamese martial arts): cương nhu phối triển (coordination between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_and_soft_(martial_arts)"] hard and soft (martial arts)).
Bamboo also symbolizes the Vietnamese hometown and Vietnamese soul: the gentlemanlike,
straightforwardness, hard working, optimism, unity, and adaptability. A Vietnamese proverb says, "Tre già,
Page 20
măng mọc" (When the bamboo is old, the bamboo sprouts appear), the meaning being Vietnam will never
be annihilated; if the previous generation dies, the children take their place. Therefore, the Vietnam nation
and Vietnamese value will be maintained and developed eternally. Traditional Vietnamese villages are
surrounded by thick bamboo hedges (lũy tre).
Mythology
A bamboo cane is also the weapon of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people"] Vietnamese legendary hero, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%A1nh_Gi%C3%B3ng"] Thánh Gióng, who had grown up
immediately and magically since the age of three because of his wish to liberate his land from Ân invaders.
The ancient Vietnamese legend Cây tre trăm đốt ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hundred-knot_Bamboo_Tree"] The Hundred-knot Bamboo Tree) tells of a poor, young
farmer who fell in love with his landlord's beautiful daughter. The farmer asked the landlord for his
daughter's hand in marriage, but the proud landlord would not allow her to be bound in marriage to a poor
farmer. The landlord decided to foil the marriage with an impossible deal; the farmer must bring him a
"bamboo tree of 100 nodes". But [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha"] Gautama Buddha (Bụt) appeared to the farmer and told him that such a
tree could be made from 100 nodes from several different trees. Bụt gave to him four magic words to attach
the many nodes of bamboo: Khắc nhập, khắc xuất, which means "joined together immediately, fell apart
immediately". The triumphant farmer returned to the landlord and demanded his daughter. Curious to see
such a long bamboo, the landlord was magically joined to the bamboo when he touched it, as the young
farmer said the first two magic words. The story ends with the happy marriage of the farmer and the
landlord's daughter after the landlord agreed to the marriage and asked to be separated from the bamboo.
