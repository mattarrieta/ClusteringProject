Fraxinus
Fraxinus ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈfræksɪnəs/),[4] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_name"] commonly called ash, is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"] genus of
 flowering plants in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive"] olive and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilac"] lilac family, Oleaceae. It
contains 45–65 species of usually medium to large trees, mostly
deciduous, though a number of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics"] subtropical species are
evergreen. The genus is widespread across much of Europe,
Asia, and North America.[3][5][6][7][8] 
Fraxinus
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf"] leaves are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposite_leaves"] opposite (rarely in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whorl_(botany)"] whorls of three), and mostly
 pinnately compound, though simple in a few species. The seeds,
popularly known as "keys" or "helicopter seeds", are a type of
 fruit known as a samara. Some Fraxinus species are dioecious,
having male and female flowers on separate plants but sex in ash
is expressed as a continuum between male and female
individuals, dominated by unisexual trees. With age, ash may
change their sexual function from predominantly male and
hermaphrodite towards femaleness;[9] if grown as an ornamental
and both sexes are present, ashes can cause a considerable litter
problem with their seeds. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan"] Rowans or mountain ashes have leaves
and buds superficially similar to those of true ashes, but belong
to the unrelated genus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorbus"] Sorbus in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosaceae"] rose family.

Ecology
North American native ash tree species are a critical food source for North American frogs, as their fallen
leaves are particularly suitable for tadpoles to feed upon in ponds (both temporary and permanent), large
puddles, and other water bodies.[15] Lack of tannins in the American ash makes their leaves a good food
source for the frogs, but also reduces its resistance to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_ash_borer#As_an_invasive_species"] ash borer. Species with higher leaf [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannin"] tannin levels
(including maples and non-native ash species) are taking the place of native ash, thanks to their greater
resistance to the ash borer. They produce much less suitable food for the tadpoles, resulting in poor survival
rates and small frog sizes.[15]
Ash species native to North America also provide important habit and food for various other creatures
native to North America. This includes the larvae of multiple long-horn beetles, as well as other insects
including those in the genus Tropidosteptes, lace bugs, aphids, larvae of gall flies, and caterpillars. Birds are
also interested in black, green, and white ash trees. The black ash alone supports wood ducks, wild turkey,
cardinals, pine grosbeaks, cedar waxwings, and yellow-bellied sapsuckers, with habitat and food (such as
Page 5
the sap being of interest to the sapsucker) among others. Many mammalian species from meadow voles
eating the seeds, white-tailed deer eating the foliage, to silver-haired bats nesting, will also make use of ash
trees. [16][17][18][19]
Ash is used as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Lepidoptera_that_feed_on_ashes"] food plant by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caterpillar"] larvae of some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepidoptera"] Lepidoptera species ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly"] butterflies and moths).
Threats 
North America
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_ash_borer"] emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), also
called EAB, is a wood-boring [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle"] beetle accidentally
introduced to North America from eastern Asia
via solid wood packing material in the late 1980s
to early 1990s. It has killed tens of millions of
trees in 22 states in the United States[20] and
adjacent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario"] Ontario and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec"] Quebec in Canada. It
threatens some seven billion ash trees in North
America. Research is being conducted to
 Canker on an ash tree in  determine if three native Asian wasps that are
North Ayrshire, Scotland natural predators of EAB could be used as a
 biological control for the management of EAB
populations in the United States. The public is
being cautioned not to transport unfinished wood products, such as firewood, to
slow the spread of this insect pest.[21] 
 Emerald ash borer
Damage occurs when emerald ash borer larvae feed on the inner bark, phloem, inside branches and tree
trunks. Feeding on the phloem prevents nutrients and water transportation. If the ash is attacked, the
branches can die and eventually the whole tree can as well.[22] Ways to detect [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_ash_borer"] emerald ash borer infestation
include seeing bark peeling off, vertical cracks in the bark, seeing galleries within the tree that contain
powdery substance, and D-shaped exit holes on the branches or trunk. Not all of these may be present, but
any of these warning signs could be an indication of possible infestation.[23]
Europe
The European ash, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraxinus_excelsior"] Fraxinus excelsior, has been affected by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"] fungus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenoscyphus_fraxineus"] Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, causing
 ash dieback[24] in a large number of trees since the mid-1990s, particularly in eastern and northern
Europe.[25][26] The disease has infected about 90% of Denmark's ash trees.[27] At the end of October 2012
in the UK, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Environment,_Food_and_Rural_Affairs"] Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) reported that ash dieback had
been discovered in mature woodland in Suffolk; previous occurrences had been on young trees imported
from Europe.[28] In 2016, the ash tree was reported as in danger of extinction in Europe.[29]
Uses
Ash is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardwood"] hardwood and is hard, dense (within 20% of 670 kg/m3 for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraxinus_americana"] Fraxinus americana,[30] and higher at
710 kg/m3 for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraxinus_excelsior"] Fraxinus excelsior[31]), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toughness"] tough and very [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_of_materials"] strong but elastic, extensively used for making bows,
 tool handles, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat"] baseball bats, hurleys, and other uses demanding high strength and resilience.
Page 6
Ash, particularly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swamp_ash"] swamp ash because of its figure, is a choice of
 material for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_guitar"] electric guitar bodies[32] and, less commonly, for
 acoustic guitar bodies, known for its bright, cutting edge and
sustaining quality. Some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Stratocaster"] Fender Stratocasters and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Telecaster"] Telecasters are
 made of ash, (such as Bruce Springsteen's Telecaster on the Born to
Run album cover), as an alternative to alder. They are also used for
making drum shells.
Woodworkers generally
5/16" thick flame figure quartersawn

consider ash a  "poor
cousin" to the other major
open pore wood, oak, but it
is useful in any furniture
application. Ash [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_veneer"] veneers are extensively used in office furniture.
Ash is not used much outdoors due to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood#Heartwood_and_sapwood"] heartwood having a low
durability to ground contact, meaning it will typically perish within
five years. The F. japonica species is favored as a material for
making baseball bats by Japanese sporting-goods
manufacturers.[33] 
Ash coffee table
Its robust structure, good looks, and flexibility combine to make ash ideal for staircases. Ash stairs are
extremely hard-wearing, which is particularly important for treads. Due to its elasticity, ash can also be
steamed and bent to produce curved stair parts such as volutes (curled sections of handrail) and intricately
shaped balusters. However, a reduction in the supply of healthy trees, especially in Europe, is making ash
an increasingly expensive option.
Ash was commonly used for the structural members of the bodies of cars made by carriage builders. Early
cars had frames which were intended to flex as part of the suspension system to simplify construction. The
 Morgan Motor Company of Great Britain still manufactures sports cars with frames made from ash. It was
also widely used by early aviation pioneers for aircraft construction.
It [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewood"] lights and burns easily, so is used for starting fires and barbecues, and is usable for maintaining a fire,
though it produces only a moderate heat. The two most economically important species for wood
 production are white ash, in eastern North America, and European ash in Europe. The green ash (F.
 pennsylvanica) is widely planted as a street tree in the United States. The inner bark of the blue ash (F.
quadrangulata) has been used as a source for blue dye.
In Sicily, Italy, sugars are obtained by evaporating the sap of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manna_ash"] manna ash, extracted by making small cuts
in the bark.The manna ash, native to southern Europe and southwest Asia, produces a blue-green sap,
which has medicinal value as a mild laxative, demulcent, and weak expectorant.
The young seedpods of Ash trees, also known as "keys," are edible for human consumption. In Britain,
they are traditionally pickled with vinegar, sugar and spices.[34]
Mythology and folklore
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology"] Greek mythology, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meliae"] Meliae are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymph"] nymphs associated with the ash, perhaps specifically of the manna ash
([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraxinus_ornus"] Fraxinus ornus), as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryad"] dryads were nymphs associated with the oak. They appear in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesiod"] Hesiod's Theogony.
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology"] Norse mythology, a vast, evergreen ash tree [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil"] Yggdrasil ("the steed (gallows) of Odin"), watered by three
magical springs, serves as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_mundi"] axis mundi, sustaining the nine worlds of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos"] cosmos in its roots and branches.
 Askr, the first man in Norse myth, literally means 'ash'.[35]

In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_folklore"] Italian folklore, an ash stake could be used to kill a vampire.[36]
