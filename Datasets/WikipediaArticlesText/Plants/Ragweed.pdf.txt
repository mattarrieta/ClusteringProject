Ragweed
Ragweeds are flowering plants in the genus Ambrosia in the
aster family, Asteraceae. They are distributed in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics"] tropical and
 subtropical regions of the Americas, especially North
America,[2] where the origin and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_diversity"] center of diversity of the genus
are in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States"] southwestern United States and northwestern
 Mexico.[3] Several species have been introduced to the Old
 World and some have naturalized and have become invasive
species.[2] Ragweed species are expected to continue spreading
across Europe in the near future in response to ongoing climate
change.[4] 
Ragweed
Other common names include bursages[5]  and
burrobrushes.[6] The genus name is from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"] Greek [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrosia"] ambrosia,
meaning "food or drink of immortality".[2]
Ragweed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollen"] pollen is notorious for causing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"] allergic reactions in
humans, specifically [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis"] allergic rhinitis. Up to half of all cases of
pollen-related allergic rhinitis in North America are caused by
ragweeds.[7]
The most widespread species of the genus in North America is
 Ambrosia artemisiifolia.

Description and ecology
Ragweeds are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant"] annual and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_plant"] perennial herbs and shrubs. Species
may grow just a few centimeters tall or exceed four meters in
height. The stems are erect, decumbent or prostrate, and many
grow from rhizomes. The leaves may be arranged alternately,

sometimes divided pinnately or palmately into lobes. The edges
are smooth or toothed. Some are hairy, and most are glandular.[2]

often in the form of a spike or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raceme"] raceme made up mostly of

Staminate flower heads have [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamen"] stamens surrounded by whitish or

purplish florets. Pistillate flower heads have fruit-yielding [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gynoecium"] ovules
surrounded by many [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bract"] phyllaries and fewer, smaller florets.[2] The pistillate flowers are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemophily"] wind pollinated,[8][9]
and the fruits develop. They are burs, sometimes adorned with knobs, wings, or spines.[2]
Many Ambrosia species occur in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert"] desert and semi-desert areas, and many are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruderal_species"] ruderal species that grow in
disturbed habitat types.[3]
Allergy
Ragweed pollen is a common allergen. A single plant may produce
about a billion grains of pollen per season,[10][11] and the pollen is
transported on the wind. It causes about half of all cases of pollen-
associated allergic rhinitis in North America, where ragweeds are
 most abundant and diverse.[7] Common culprits are common
ragweed (A. artemisiifolia) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrosia_trifida"] great ragweed (A. trifida).[12]
Concentration of ragweed pollen—in the absence of significant
rainfall, which removes pollen from the air, is the lowest in the
early morning hours (6:00 AM),  when emissions starts, pollen
concentration peaks at midday.[13] Ragweed pollen can remain 
 Ambrosia artemisiifolia pollen
airborne for days and travel great distances, and can even be carried
300–400 miles (500–600 km) out to sea.[14] Ragweeds native to the Americas have been introduced to
Europe starting in the nineteenth century and especially during [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"] World War I, and have spread rapidly since
the 1950s.[15] Eastern Europe, particularly Hungary, has been badly affected by ragweed since the early
1990s, when the dismantling of Communist collective agriculture led to large-scale abandonment of
agricultural land, and new building projects also resulted in disturbed, un-landscaped areas.[16]
The major allergenic compound in the pollen has been identified as Amb a 1, a 38 kDa nonglycosylated
protein composed of two subunits. It also contains other allergenic components, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profilin"] profilin and
 calcium-binding proteins.[17]
Ragweed allergy sufferers may show signs of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_allergy_syndrome"] oral allergy syndrome, a food allergy classified by a cluster
of allergic reactions in the mouth in response to the consumption certain fruits, vegetables, and nuts.[18]
Foods commonly involved include beans, celery, cumin, hazelnuts, kiwifruit, parsley, potatoes, bananas,
melons, cucumbers, and zucchini. Because cooking usually [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denaturation_(biochemistry)"] denatures the proteins that cause the reaction,
the foods are more allergenic when eaten raw; exceptions are celery and nuts, which may not be safe even
when cooked.[18] Signs of reaction can include itching, burning, and swelling of the mouth and throat,
runny eyes and nose, hives, and, less commonly, vomiting, diarrhea, asthma, and anaphylaxis.[18] These
symptoms are due to the abnormal increase of IgE antibodies which attach to a type of immune cell called
mast cells. When the ragweed antigen then attaches to these antibodies the mast cells release histamine and
other symptom evoking chemicals.[19]
Page 3
 Merck & Co, under license from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen_immunotherapy"] allergy immunotherapy (AIT) company ALK, has launched a ragweed
allergy immunotherapy treatment in sublingual tablet form in the US and Canada. Allergy immunotherapy
treatment involves administering doses of the allergen to accustom the body to induce specific long-term
tolerance.[20]
Control and eradication
Chemical spraying has been used for control in large areas. Because ragweed only reacts to some of the
more aggressive herbicides, it is highly recommended to consult professionals when deciding on dosage
and methodology, especially near urban areas. Effective active ingredients include those that are
glyphosate-based (Roundup, Glyphogan, Glialka), sulfosate-based (Medallon), and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glufosinate_ammonium"] glufosinate ammonium-
based ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Finale_14SL&action=edit&redlink=1"] Finale 14SL). In badly infested areas, 2 to 6.5 liters per hectare (0.2–0.7 U.S. gal/acre) are usually
dispersed.[21] In 2007 several Ambrosia artemisiifolia populations were glyphosate resistant, exclusively in
the USA.[22]
Where herbicides cannot be used, mowing may be repeated about every three weeks, as it grows back
rapidly. In the past, ragweed was usually cut down, left to dry, and then burned.[23] This method is used
less often now, because of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution"] pollution caused by smoke. Manually uprooting ragweed is generally
ineffective, and skin contact can cause allergic reaction. If uprooting is the method of choice, it should be
performed before flowering. There is evidence that mechanical and chemical control methods are actually
no more effective in the long run than leaving the weed in place.[23]
 Fungal rusts and the leaf-eating beetle Ophraella communa have been proposed as agents of biological pest
control of ragweeds, but the latter may also attack sunflowers, and applications for permits and funding to
test these controls have been unsuccessful.[24] The beetle has, however, appeared in Europe, either on its
own or as an uncontrolled introduction, and it has started making a dent into Ambrosia populations
there.[25][26][27][28]
