Strauder v. West Virginia
 Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303 (1880), was a landmark
 decision of the Supreme Court of the United States about racial
 discrimination and United States constitutional criminal
procedure.[1] Strauder was the first instance where the Supreme
Court reversed a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"] state court decision denying a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant"] defendant's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)"] motion
to remove his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure"] criminal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial"] trial to federal court pursuant to Section 3 of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1866"] Civil Rights Act of 1866.[2] 
Strauder v. West Virginia
Its holding, along with those of its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_case"] companion cases of Virginia v.
Rives (1880) and Ex parte Virginia (1880) established the 
 Supreme Court of the United
States
 proposition that it is a denial to criminal defendants of the equal
protection of the law for a state to exclude persons from service on
a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_juries_in_the_United_States"] grand or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petit_jury"] petit jury on account of race, color, or previous
condition of servitude. These holdings do not guarantee criminal
defendants that the grand or petit juries involved in their case will
be composed either in full or in part of members of a non-white
defendant's race (as was sought in the Rives case), but held instead
that equal protection demands only that potential jurors could not
be excluded from jury service on account of their race.
Additionally, the Supreme Court did not exercise its power of

Act of 1866
Background
On the morning of April 18, 1872 in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheeling,_West_Virginia"] Wheeling, West Virginia, Taylor Strauder, a former slave, murdered
his wife Anna by bludgeoning her to death with two strikes from a hatchet handle to the left side of her
head after having argued with her through the night about an allegation of her marital infidelity. Strauder's
step-daughter, Fannie Green, witnessed the murder, and Strauder threatened Green to remain quiet, lest she
too be killed. Strauder fled and was arrested in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh,_Pennsylvania"] Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on April 25, 1872.
Procedural history
 Following the passage and ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, Congress passed the Civil
Rights Act of 1866. Under section 3 of the act, Congress provided to defendants in state trials the right to
remove to federal court "all causes, civil or criminal," arising under state or municipal laws wherein "any of
the rights secured to [the defendant] by the first section of this act" were denied or could not be enforced.
Later fearing that the Thirteenth Amendment might not provide a sufficient legal basis for the Civil Rights
Act, Congress passed and the states ratified the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] Fourteenth Amendment. Congress then passed the act of
May 31, 1870, of which section 18 reenacted the Civil Rights Act of 1866. Moreover, section 16 of the
1870 act also provided that "all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right
in every State and Territory in the United States... to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings
for the security of person and property as is enjoyed by white citizens[.]"
First trial
Upon his return to Wheeling, Strauder was brought before the circuit court for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_County,_West_Virginia"] Ohio County, West Virginia
and given a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause_hearing"] preliminary examination, Judge [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thayer_Melvin"] Thayer Melvin presiding. Strauder was assigned counsel,
George O. Davenport and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn_B._Dovener"] Blackburn B. Dovener, and his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment"] arraignment was set for the May 1872 term of
Page 3
the circuit court. On May 20, 1872 the grand jury returned an indictment for murder in the first degree.
Strauder [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrer"] demurred the indictment as defective, arguing the facts alleged did not rise to murder in the first
degree, and that the panel from which the grand jury was selected excluded non-whites; the court overruled
the arguments. Counsel for Strauder then attempted to remove the case to the U.S. district court for West
Virginia, but this too was overruled. Strauder then pleaded not guilty by reason of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_insanity"] temporary insanity and
asked the court for a continuance to the October term, which was granted. At the next term, Strauder
received a second continuance to the May 1873 term.
During the first continuance, the State of West Virginia adopted a new state constitution in August 1872.
The state legislature reconstructed the state courts and passed a criminal procedure bill on April 3, 1873
providing criminal defendants with preliminary examinations to occur at the county court (as distinguished
from the circuit court for the county). At the May 1873 term of the circuit court, Strauder made a motion
requesting this examination before the county court. The circuit court denied the motion, citing the
preliminary examination the circuit court had already given. The case then proceeded to trial over May 6–8,
1873; the jury returned a verdict of guilty after approximately 90 minutes of deliberations. The court
sentenced Strauder to death by hanging on July 8, 1873.
First appeal
On appeal, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Appeals_of_West_Virginia"] Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia held on July 20, 1874 that, since Strauder's case
had not yet commenced trial at the time of the passage of the April 3, 1873 statute providing for a
preliminary examination before trial, Strauder's case was within the scope of the statute. Since Strauder had
timely made the request for the examination, the ruling of the circuit court denying the examination by the
county court on grounds that the statute wasn't applicable to the case was reversed. "The error of the circuit
court in refusing the accused an examination before the county court of the county of Ohio upon said
charge of murder, is fatal to all the other proceedings in the cause by which the accused was tried,
convicted and sentenced to be hung..." Consequently, the supreme court reversed the circuit court's denial
of the request for the preliminary examination, overruled and nulled all rulings made in the case after that
point, set aside the verdict, and remanded the case with instructions that the preliminary examination take
place in the county court in accordance with the law.
Second trial
The clerk of the circuit court certified the case to the county court, which completed its preliminary
examination on September 9, 1874 and remanded Strauder to the circuit court for trial. A grand jury was
convened and on October 20, 1874 it returned an indictment similar to that of May 20, 1872. Strauder's
arraignment on the new indictment took place on November 2, 1874.
At the arraignment, Strauder and his counsel moved to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quash"] quash the new indictment and to remove the case to
federal court on grounds that non-white citizens were precluded by West Virginia law from grand and petit
jury service. During the course of the first trial, an act regarding trial procedure had passed as part of the
1873 reconstruction of the West Virginia courts in consequence of the new state constitution; the act of
March 12, 1873 provided "[a]ll white male persons, who are twenty-one years of age and not over sixty,
and who are citizens of this State, shall be liable to serve as jurors, except as herein provided." The only
exception provided regarded service as a state official. The judge denied both motions. Strauder then
demurred each count contained in the indictment and was again overruled. At that point, Strauder pleaded
not guilty to the indictment, and the trial proceeded to jury selection, which resulted in an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-white_jury"] all-white jury. An
objection to the composition of this jury was entered, and overruled. The trial continued through November
4 when the case went to the jury for deliberations. On November 5, the jury returned a verdict of guilty and
Page 4
a sentence of death. Strauder and his counsel moved for a new trial on grounds of an impartial juror and
that the jury contained no jurors of Strauder's race, for which arguments were heard January 5, 1875. The
court overruled the motions, and sentenced Strauder to death by hanging on January 9, 1875.
Second appeal
Arguments before the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia took place June 27, 1876. Strauder's
counsel raised 11 points of exception. The supreme court handed down its ruling on November 17, 1877,
relying on the opinions of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States"] Supreme Court of the United States in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughter-House_Cases"] The Slaughter-House Cases and
 Bradwell v. Illinois to find the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] Fourteenth Amendment had not been "intended to protect the citizens of any
State against unjust legislation by their own State." The supreme court consequently affirmed the trial
court's denial of the motion to remove of the case to federal court as correct. Strauder's case was then sent
back to the circuit court of Ohio county for resentencing, but held over until the April 1878 term.
While awaiting resentencing, Strauder and his counsel appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.
On April 15, 1878, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States"] Chief Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrison_Waite"] Morrison Waite granted a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ_of_error"] writ of error. The case was set for argument in
the October 1879 term, and oral arguments were heard over October 20–21, 1879 along with the
companion cases of Virginia v. Rives and Ex parte Virginia. Assisting Strauder's counsel in the arguments
 before the Supreme Court were U.S. Attorney General Charles Devens and former justice of the Supreme
 Court of Virginia Westel Willoughby. Arguing for the State of West Virginia were West Virginia Attorney
General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_White_(attorney_general)"] Robert White and special counsel James W. Green, a Virginia lawyer.
Decision
The majority opinion, written by Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Strong_(Pennsylvania_judge)"] William Strong, focused on two legal questions:
1. Does the Constitution of the United States afford citizens of the United States a right to trial
by a jury selected and empaneled without discrimination against prospective jurors on
account of a juror's race or color?
2. If such a right exists and is denied by the state, may the case be removed to federal court
pursuant to Congress's power of enforcement under the Fourteenth Amendment?
The majority held that categorical exclusion of blacks from juries for no other reason than their race
violated the Equal Protection Clause since the very purpose of the Clause was "to assure to the colored race
the enjoyment of all the civil rights that under the law are enjoyed by white persons, and to give to that race
the protection of the general government, in that enjoyment, whenever it should be denied by the States."
The Court did not say that a law barring blacks from juries violated the rights of potential jury members, but
that such an exclusion violated the rights of black criminal defendants since juries would be "drawn from a
panel from which the State has expressly excluded every man of [a defendant's] race."
However, the Court did not strike down West Virginia's law respecting juror qualifications as
unconstitutional, as Strauder had not challenged the law on that ground. Instead, it proceeded with an
analysis of whether the denial of equal protection of the law confronting Strauder was of a nature sufficient
to motivate an exercise of Congressional authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enact
federal legislation allowing for the removal of cases such as Strauder's to the local federal district court,
presumably where the trial process, under the supervision of a federal judge, would enforce the defendant's
rights against the state.
Dissent
Page 5
The two dissenting justices, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_J._Field"] Field and Clifford, explained their position in the case of Ex Parte Virginia,
decided the same day.[3] In the latter case, Field wrote, with Clifford joining, "The equality of the
protection secured extends only to civil rights, as distinguished from those which are political or arise from
the form of the government and its mode of administration."[3]
Subsequent case history
The Supreme Court of the United States on July 9, 1880 remanded the case to the Supreme Court of
Appeals of West Virginia, and ordered that the court reverse the decision of the circuit court and remand the
case for further proceedings. By August 17, 1880, the Supreme Court of Appeals had done as ordered,
setting aside the verdict and sentence of the second trial, and reversing the ruling of the circuit court that
had denied to Strauder the removal of the case to federal court. The orders of the Supreme Court and the
Supreme Court of Appeals were entered into the circuit court record on Saturday, August 21, 1880 and the
case was ordered to be removed to the U.S. district court.
Federal court
On Monday, September 6, 1880, the sheriff of Ohio County was served with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ_of_habeas_corpus"] writ of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus_in_the_United_States"] habeas corpus to
produce Strauder before the U.S. district court the next day and to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_cause"] show cause why he was being held.
Over the next two days, before Judge [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay_Jackson_Jr."] John Jay Jackson Jr., arguments were heard over why the writ should
be quashed, the state seeking to maintain its custody of Strauder. Arguments were also heard whether
Strauder should be released pending the next hearings, or bail set. On Thursday, September 9, the court
denied the state's motion to quash the writ, ordered custody of Strauder be transferred to the U.S. Marshal,
and that a bail hearing for Strauder be scheduled. By October 9, Judge Jackson denied both discharge and
bail.
The case was next heard on Thursday, January 13, 1881, whereupon Strauder entered a plea of abatement
to defeat the 1874 indictment on the grounds that it too suffered from the constitutional deficiency passed
upon by the Supreme Court—that is, the venire from which the grand jury had been drawn in May 1874,
subject to the same 1873 jury law, excluded non-whites as jurors. On Saturday, April 30, 1881, Judge
Jackson ruled in favor of Strauder, quashing the 1874 indictment and discharging Strauder from federal
custody.
Rearrest
Anticipating that the federal court would discharge Strauder, the Wheeling Chief of Police Henry Conant
swore out in secret a new warrant for Strauder's arrest before [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquilla_B._Caldwell"] Aquilla B. Caldwell of the First Judicial
Circuit on April 7, 1881. When the federal court then in fact discharged Strauder, Conant immediately
moved to rearrest Strauder in the courtroom; Judge Jackson objected, causing Conant to withdraw. Conant
instead rearrested Strauder upon his leaving the federal courthouse, and both returned to Wheeling on May
2. The next day, arguments were heard before Judge Caldwell regarding the circuit court's jurisdiction.
Strauder and his counsel argued that even though the U.S. district court had discharged Strauder, it had
 only done so on the 1874 indictment, and since the state's prosecutor had never made a declaration of nolle
prosequi or otherwise dismissed the 1872 indictment, and since the entire case had been certified to the
federal district court, both the 1872 and 1874 indictments were under the federal court's jurisdiction when
the April 7 warrant had issued. Further, since the 1872 indictment was still pending before the federal court,
it still had jurisdiction over the case. As such, argued Strauder, the state circuit court had no jurisdiction,
rendering its warrant invalid. Judge Caldwell ultimately agreed that the 1872 indictment was still alive and
before the federal court, and ordered Strauder discharged from state custody, finally freeing Strauder from
his nine-years confinement.

Impact
While a victory for the rights of black defendants and an important early civil rights case, Strauder v. West
Virginia upheld the right of states to bar women or other classes from juries by holding, in the words of
Justice Strong, that a state "may confine the selection to males, to freeholders, to citizens, to persons within
certain ages, or to persons having educational qualifications. We do not believe the Fourteenth Amendment
was ever intended to prohibit this.... Its aim was against discrimination because of race or color."[4] The
precedent set by Strauder has continued to influence rulings in cases as late as 1961 in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoyt_v._Florida"] Hoyt v. Florida.[5]
Because it was not raised in the context of Strauder, the Court also did not consider in its analysis whether
state actions that have a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disparate_impact"] disparate impact upon African-Americans would violate the Equal Protection
Clause; that question was not considered until almost a century later in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_v._Davis"] Washington v. Davis,  which
reaffirmed that Strauder "established that the exclusion of [African-Americans] from grand and petit juries
in criminal proceedings violated the Equal Protection Clause, but the fact that a particular jury or a series of
juries does not statistically reflect the racial composition of the community does not, in itself, make out an
 invidious discrimination forbidden by the Clause." 246 U.S. 229 (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/u
s/246/229/) (1976).
