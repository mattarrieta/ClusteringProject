Plessy v. Ferguson
 Plessy v. Ferguson,  163 U.S. 537 (1896),  was a landmark
decision of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States"] United States Supreme Court in which the Court
 ruled that racial segregation laws did not violate the U.S.
Constitution as long as the facilities for each race were equal in
 quality, a doctrine that came to be known as "separate but
equal".[2][3] The decision legitimized the many state laws re-
establishing racial segregation that had been passed in the
 American South after the end of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era"] Reconstruction Era (1865–
1877).
The underlying case began in 1892 when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Plessy"] Homer Plessy, a mixed-
race resident of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans"] New Orleans, deliberately violated Louisiana's
 Separate Car Act of 1890, which required "equal, but separate"
railroad accommodations for white and non-white passengers.
Plessy was charged with boarding a "whites-only" car, and his
lawyers petitioned Judge [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard_Ferguson"] John Howard Ferguson to throw out the
case on the grounds that the law was unconstitutional. Ferguson
overruled Plessy's petition, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Supreme_Court"] Louisiana Supreme Court
upheld Ferguson's ruling. Plessy then appealed to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
In May 1896, the Supreme Court issued a 7–1 decision against
 Plessy, ruling that the Louisiana law did not violate the Fourteenth
Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and stating that although the
Fourteenth Amendment established the legal equality of whites
and blacks it did not and could not require the elimination of all
"distinctions based upon color".  The Court rejected Plessy's
lawyers' arguments that the Louisiana law inherently implied that
black people were inferior, and gave great deference to American
state legislatures' inherent power to make laws regulating health,
safety, and morals—the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_power_(United_States_constitutional_law)"] police power"—and to determine the
 reasonableness of the laws they passed. Justice John Marshall
Harlan was the lone dissenter from the Court's decision, writing
that the U.S. Constitution "is color-blind, and neither knows nor
tolerates classes among citizens", and so the law's distinguishing of
passengers' races should have been found unconstitutional.
Plessy is widely regarded as one of the worst decisions in U.S.
Supreme Court history.[4] Despite its infamy, the decision has
never been explicitly overruled.[5] But a series of the Court's later
 decisions, beginning with the 1954 decision Brown v. Board of
Education—which held that the "separate but equal" doctrine is
unconstitutional in the context of public schools and educational
facilities—have severely weakened Plessy to the point that it is
considered to have been de facto overruled.[6]

Incident
In 1890, the state of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana"] Louisiana passed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separate_Car_Act"] Separate Car Act, which required separate accommodations for
blacks and whites on railroads, including separate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_car"] railway cars.[7] Concerned, a group of prominent black,
 creole of color, and white creole [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans"] New Orleans residents formed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comit%C3%A9_des_Citoyens"] Comité des Citoyens (Committee of
 Citizens) dedicated to repeal the law or fight its effect.[8] They persuaded Homer Plessy, a man of mixed
race who was an "octoroon" (person of seven-eighths white and one-eighth black ancestry), to participate
in an orchestrated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_case_(law)"] test case. Plessy was born a free man and was a fair-skinned man of color. However,
under Louisiana law, he was classified as black, and thus required to sit in the "colored" car.[9]
On June 7, 1892, Plessy bought a first-class ticket at the Press Street Depot and boarded a "Whites Only"
car of the East Louisiana Railroad in New Orleans, Louisiana, bound for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covington,_Louisiana"] Covington, Louisiana.[10] The
railroad company, which had opposed the law on the grounds that it would require the purchase of more
railcars, had been previously informed of Plessy's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)"] racial lineage, and the intent to challenge the law.[11]
Additionally, the Comité des Citoyens hired a private detective with arrest powers to detain Plessy, to
ensure that he would be charged for violating the Separate Car Act, as opposed to vagrancy or some other
offense.[11] After Plessy took a seat in the whites-only railway car, he was asked to vacate it, and sit instead
in the blacks-only car. Plessy refused and was arrested immediately by the detective.[12] As planned, the
train was stopped, and Plessy was taken off the train at Press and Royal streets.[11] Plessy was remanded
for trial in Orleans Parish.[13]
Page 3
Trial
Plessy petitioned the state district criminal court to throw out the case, State v. Homer Adolph Plessy,[14] on
the grounds that the state law requiring East Louisiana Railroad to segregate trains had denied him his
rights under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] Thirteenth and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] Fourteenth amendments of the United States Constitution,[15] which
 provided for equal treatment under the law. However, the judge presiding over his case, John Howard
Ferguson, ruled that Louisiana had the right to regulate railroad companies while they operated within state
boundaries. Four days later, Plessy petitioned the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Supreme_Court"] Louisiana Supreme Court for a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writ_of_prohibition"] writ of prohibition to stop
his criminal trial.[13][16]
State appeal
The Louisiana Supreme Court issued a temporary writ of prohibition while it reviewed Plessy's case. In
December 1892, the court upheld Judge Ferguson's ruling,[17] and denied Plessy's attorneys' subsequent
request for a rehearing.[18][19] In speaking for the court's decision that Ferguson's judgment did not violate
the 14th Amendment, Louisiana Supreme Court Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Erasmus_Fenner"] Charles Erasmus Fenner cited a number of
precedents, including two key cases from Northern states. The Massachusetts Supreme Court had ruled in
1849—before the 14th amendment—that segregated schools were constitutional. In answering the charge
that segregation perpetuated race prejudice, the Massachusetts court famously stated: "This prejudice, if it
exists, is not created by law, and probably cannot be changed by law."[20] The law itself was repealed five
years later, but the precedent stood.[21]
In a Pennsylvania law mandating separate railcars for different races the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
stated: "To assert separateness is not to declare inferiority ... It is simply to say that following the order of
Divine Providence, human authority ought not to compel these widely separated races to intermix."[22][21]
Supreme Court appeal
Undaunted, the Committee appealed to the United States Supreme Court.[15] Two legal briefs were
submitted on Plessy's behalf. One was signed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albion_W._Tourg%C3%A9e"] Albion W. Tourgée and James C. Walker and the other by
 Samuel F. Phillips and his legal partner F. D. McKenney. Oral arguments were held before the Supreme
Court on April 13, 1896. Tourgée and Phillips appeared in the courtroom to speak on behalf of Plessy.[13]
Tourgée built his case upon violation of Plessy's rights under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] 13th Amendment, prohibiting slavery, and
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] 14th Amendment, which states "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the
privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life,
liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws." Tourgée argued that the reputation of being a black man was "property", which, by
the law, implied the inferiority of African Americans as compared to whites.[23] The state legal brief was
prepared by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_Louisiana"] Attorney General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Joseph_Cunningham"] Milton Joseph Cunningham of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natchitoches,_Louisiana"] Natchitoches and New Orleans. Cunningham
was a staunch supporter of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy"] white supremacy, who according to a laudatory 1916 obituary "worked so
effectively [during Reconstruction] in restoring white supremacy in politics that he finally was arrested,
with fifty-one other men of that community, and tried by federal officials."[24]
Decision
On May 18, 1896, the Supreme Court issued a 7–1 decision[note 1] against Plessy that upheld the
constitutionality of Louisiana's train car segregation laws.[11]
Page 4
Opinion of the Court
Seven justices formed the Court's majority and joined an opinion written by
 Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Billings_Brown"] Henry Billings Brown. The Court first dismissed any claim that the
Louisiana law violated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] Thirteenth Amendment, which, in the majority's
opinion, did no more than ensure that black Americans had the basic level
of legal equality needed to abolish slavery.[25]
 Next, the Court considered whether the law violated the Fourteenth
Amendment's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause"] Equal Protection Clause, which reads: "nor shall any State ...
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."
The Court concluded that although the Fourteenth Amendment was meant
to guarantee the legal equality of all races in America, it was not intended
to prevent social or other types of discrimination.[25]
The object of the [Fourteenth] Amendment was undoubtedly
to enforce the absolute equality of the two races before the
law, but in the nature of things, it could not have been intended
to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, as
distinguished from political equality, or a commingling of the
two races upon terms unsatisfactory to either.
— Plessy, 163 U.S. at 543–44.[26] 
 Justice Henry Billings
Brown, author of the
majority opinion in Plessy
The Court reasoned that laws requiring racial separation were within Louisiana's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_power_(United_States_constitutional_law)"] police power: the core
sovereign authority of U.S. states to pass laws on matters of "health, safety, and morals".[25] It held that as
long as a law that classified and separated people by their race was a reasonable and good faith exercise of
a state's police power and was not designed to oppress a particular class, the law did not violate the Equal
Protection Clause.[25] According to the Court, the question in any case that involved a racial segregation
law was whether the law was reasonable, and the Court gave State legislatures broad discretion to
determine the reasonableness of the laws they passed.[25]
Plessy's lawyers had argued that segregation laws inherently implied that black people were inferior, and
therefore stigmatized them with a second-class status that violated the Equal Protection Clause.[27] But the
Court rejected this argument.[28]
We consider the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff's argument to consist in the assumption that
the enforced separation of the two races stamps the colored race with a badge of inferiority. If
this be so, it is not by reason of anything found in the act, but solely because the colored race
chooses to put that construction on it.
— Plessy, 163 U.S. at 551.[29]
The Court rejected the notion that the law marked black Americans with "a badge of inferiority", and said
that racial prejudice could not be overcome by legislation.[25]
Harlan's dissent
Page 5
Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Marshall_Harlan"] John Marshall Harlan was the lone dissenter from the decision.
Harlan strongly disagreed with the Court's conclusion that the Louisiana
law did not imply that blacks were inferior, and he accused the majority
of being willfully ignorant on the subject.
Every one knows that the statute in question had its origin
in the purpose, not so much to exclude white people from
railroad cars occupied by blacks, as to exclude colored
people from coaches occupied by or assigned to white
persons. ... The thing to accomplish was, under the guise of
giving equal accommodation for whites and blacks, to
compel the latter to keep to themselves while traveling in
railroad passenger coaches. No one would be so wanting in
candor as to assert the contrary.
— Plessy, 163 U.S. at 557 (Harlan, J., dissenting).[30] 
 John Marshall Harlan became
known as the "Great Dissenter"
for his fiery dissent in Plessy
and other early civil rights
cases.
To support his argument, Harlan pointed out that the Louisiana law
contained an exception for "nurses attending children of the other race". This exception allowed black
women who were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanny"] nannies to white children to be in the white-only train cars.[31] Harlan said that this
showed that the Louisiana law only allowed black people to be in white-only cars if it was obvious that
they were "social subordinates" or "domestics".[31]
Harlan argued that even though many white Americans of the late 19th century considered themselves
superior to Americans of other races, the U.S. Constitution was "color-blind" in matters of law and civil
rights.[28]
The white race deems itself to be the dominant race in this country. And so it is in prestige, in
achievements, in education, in wealth and in power. ... But in view of the constitution, in the
eye of the law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is
no caste here. Our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among
citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer
of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings
or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved.
— Plessy, 163 U.S. at 559 (Harlan, J., dissenting).[30]
Harlan predicted that the Plessy decision would eventually become as infamous as the Court's 1857
decision [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford"] Dred Scott v. Sandford, in which the Court ruled that black Americans could not be citizens under
the U.S. Constitution, and that its legal protections and privileges could never apply to them.
Aftermath
After the Supreme Court ruling, Plessy's criminal trial went ahead in Ferguson's court in Louisiana on
February 11, 1897.[32] Plessy changed his plea to "guilty" of violating the Separate Car Act, which carried
a $25 fine or 20 days in jail. He opted to pay the fine.[33] The Comité des Citoyens disbanded shortly after
the trial's end.[34]
Significance
Page 6
Plessy legitimized state laws establishing "racial" segregation
in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"] South and provided an impetus for further segregation
laws. It also legitimized laws in the North requiring "racial"
segregation, such as in the Boston school segregation case
noted by Justice Brown in his majority opinion.[36]
Legislative achievements won during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Era"] Reconstruction Era
were erased through means of the "separate but equal"
doctrine.[37] The doctrine had been strengthened also by an
1875 Supreme Court decision that limited the federal
government's ability to intervene in state affairs, guaranteeing
to Congress only the power "to restrain states from acts of
racial discrimination and segregation".[38] The ruling 
An [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City"] Oklahoma City streetcar terminal's
"colored" drinking fountain, 1939.[35]
basically granted states legislative immunity when dealing
with questions of "race", guaranteeing the states' right to
implement racially separate institutions, requiring them only to be equal.[39]
Despite the pretense of "separate but equal",  non-whites
essentially always received inferior facilities and treatment, if
they received them at all.[40]
The prospect of greater state influence in matters of race
worried numerous advocates of civil equality, including
Supreme Court Justice John Harlan, who wrote in his Plessy
1904 caricature of "White" and "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow"] Jim Crow"
rail cars by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_T._McCutcheon"] John T. McCutcheon 
dissent, "we shall enter upon an era of constitutional law,
when the rights of freedom and American citizenship cannot
receive from the nation that efficient protection which
heretofore was unhesitatingly accorded to slavery and the
rights of the master."[38] Harlan's concerns about the
encroachment on the 14th Amendment would prove well-founded; states proceeded to institute
segregation-based laws that became known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws"] Jim Crow system.[41] In addition, from 1890 to 1908,
Southern states passed new or amended constitutions including provisions that effectively [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disfranchisement_after_Reconstruction_era"] disenfranchised
blacks and thousands of poor whites.
Some commentators, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_J._Chin"] Gabriel J. Chin[42] and Eric Maltz,[43] have viewed Harlan's Plessy dissent in
a more critical light, and suggested it be viewed in context with his other decisions.[42] Maltz has argued
that "modern commentators have often overstated Harlan's distaste for race-based classifications", pointing
to other aspects of decisions in which Harlan was involved.[44] Both point to a passage of Harlan's Plessy
dissent as particularly troubling:[45][46]
There is a race so different from our own that we do not permit those belonging to it to become
citizens of the United States. Persons belonging to it are, with few exceptions, absolutely
excluded from our country. I allude to the Chinese race. But, by the statute in question, a
Chinaman can ride in the same passenger coach with white citizens of the United States, while
citizens of the black race in Louisiana, many of whom, perhaps, risked their lives for the
preservation of the Union ... and who have all the legal rights that belong to white citizens, are
yet declared to be criminals, liable to imprisonment, if they ride in a public coach occupied by
citizens of the white race.[47]
Page 7
New Orleans historian Keith Weldon Medley, author of We As Freemen: Plessy v. Ferguson, The Fight
Against Legal Segregation, said the words in Justice Harlan's "Great Dissent" were taken from papers filed
with the court by "The Citizen's Committee".[48]
The effect of the Plessy ruling was immediate; there were already significant differences in funding for the
segregated school system, which continued into the 20th century; states consistently underfunded black
schools, providing them with substandard buildings, textbooks, and supplies. States which had successfully
integrated elements of their society abruptly adopted oppressive legislation that erased reconstruction era
efforts.[49] The principles of Plessy v. Ferguson were affirmed in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lum_v._Rice"] Lum v. Rice (1927), which upheld the
right of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi"] Mississippi public school for white children to exclude a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_American"] Chinese American girl. Despite the laws
enforcing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_education"] compulsory education, and the lack of public schools for Chinese children in Lum's area, the
Supreme Court ruled that she had the choice to attend a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school"] private school.[50] Jim Crow laws and practices
spread northward in response to a second wave of African-American migration from the South to northern
and midwestern cities. Some established [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_jure"] de jure segregated educational facilities, separate public institutions
such as hotels and restaurants, separate beaches among other public facilities, and restrictions on interracial
 marriage, but in other cases segregation in the North was related to unstated practices and operated on a de
facto basis, although not by law, among numerous other facets of daily life.[49]
The separate facilities and institutions accorded to the African-American community were consistently
inferior[51] to those provided to the White community. This contradicted the vague declaration of "separate
but equal" issued after the Plessy decision.[52] Since no state wrote the "separate but equal" doctrine into a
statute, there was no remedy, other than going back to the U.S. Supreme Court, if the separate facilities
were not equal, and states faced no consequences if they underfunded services and facilities for non-whites.
From 1890 to 1908, state legislatures in the South disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites
through rejecting them for voter registration and voting: making voter registration more difficult by
providing more detailed records, such as proof of land ownership or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_tests"] literacy tests administered by white
staff at poll stations. African-American community leaders, who had achieved brief political success during
the Reconstruction era and even into the 1880s, lost gains made when their voters were excluded from the
political system. Historian Rogers Smith noted on the subject that "lawmakers frequently admitted, indeed
 boasted, that such measures as complex registration rules, literacy and property tests, poll taxes, white
primaries, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_clauses"] grandfather clauses were designed to produce an electorate confined to a white race that
declared itself supreme",  notably rejecting the 14th and 15th Amendments to the American
Constitution.[53]
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education"] Brown v. Board of Education (1954), the US Supreme Court ruled that segregation in public education
was unconstitutional.[54] Plessy v. Ferguson was never explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court, but is
effectively dead as a precedent.[55] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964"] Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited legal segregation and the
 Voting Rights Act of 1965 provided for federal oversight and enforcement of voter registration and voting.
Plessy and Ferguson Foundation
In 2009, Keith Plessy and Phoebe Ferguson, descendants of participants on both sides of the 1896 Supreme
Court case, announced establishing the Plessy and Ferguson Foundation for Education and Reconciliation.
The foundation will work to create new ways to teach the history of civil rights through film, art, and public
programs designed to create understanding of this historic case and its effect on the American
conscience.[56]
In 2009, a marker was placed[11] at the corner of Press and Royal Streets, near where Plessy had boarded
his train.[57]
Page 8
Pardon
In 2021, the Louisiana Board of Pardons unanimously approved a pardon of Plessy, sending it to Gov.
 John Bel Edwards for final approval.[58] Edwards granted the pardon on January 5, 2022.[59]
