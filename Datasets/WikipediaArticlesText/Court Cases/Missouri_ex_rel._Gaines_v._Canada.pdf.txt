Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada
Missouri [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_rel."] ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U.S. 337 (1938), was a
 United States Supreme Court decision holding that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"] states which
provided a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_state_universities_in_the_United_States"] school to white students had to provide in-state
education to blacks as well. States could satisfy this requirement by
allowing blacks and whites to attend the same school or creating a
second school for blacks.[1]

Background
The Registrar at the Law School of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Missouri"] University of Missouri,
Silas Woodson Canada,  refused admission to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Gaines"] Lloyd Gaines
because he was black.[2] At the time, blacks could attend no law
school specifically in the state. Gaines cited that the refusal
violated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] Fourteenth Amendment. The State of Missouri had
offered to pay for Gaines's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuition"] tuition at an adjacent state's law school,
which he turned down.
Gaines, assisted by the NAACP, sued the all-white university in
 1935. The issue was whether Missouri violated the Equal
Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by affording
whites, not blacks, the ability to attend law school within the state.
Decision
Writing for the majority, Chief Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Evans_Hughes"] Charles Evans Hughes held
that when the state provides legal training, it must provide it to
every qualified person to satisfy equal protection. It can neither
send them to other states, nor condition that training for one group
of people, such as blacks, on levels of demand from that group.
Key to the court's conclusion was that there was no provision for
legal education of blacks in Missouri so Missouri law guaranteeing
equal protection applied. Sending Gaines to another state would
have been irrelevant.

Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_C._McReynolds"] James C. McReynolds's dissent emphasized a body of case
law, with sweeping statements about state control of education
before suggesting the possibility that despite the majority opinion,
Missouri could still deny Gaines admission.
The decision did not quite strike down [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separate_but_equal"] separate but equal facilities,
upheld in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson"] Plessy v. Ferguson (1896). Instead, it provided that if
there was only one school, students of all races could be admitted.
The decision struck down segregation by exclusion if the
government provided just one school, making the decision in this
case a precursor to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education"] Brown v. Board of Education (1954).
This marked the beginning of the Supreme Court's reconsideration
of Plessy. The Supreme Court did not overturn Plessy v. Ferguson
or violate the "separate but equal" precedents, but began to
concede the difficulty and near-impossibility of a state maintaining
segregated black and white institutions that could never be truly
equal. Therefore, it can be said that this case helped forge the legal
framework for Brown v. Board of Education,  which banned
segregation in public schools.

is no separate school for blacks.
