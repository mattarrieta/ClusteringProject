Yick Wo v. Hopkins
Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886), was the first case where
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court"] United States Supreme Court ruled that a law that is race-
neutral on its face, but is administered in a prejudicial manner, is an
 infringement of the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth
Amendment to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Constitution"] U.S. Constitution.[1]

Background
The immigration of Chinese to California began in 1850 at the
beginning of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Rush"] Gold Rush. They soon began to branch out to
jobs in agriculture and made up a large group of railroad workers.
As the Chinese became more successful, tensions with white
Americans grew. White Californians were wary of the cultural and
ethnic differences.[2] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act"] Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was the
first of many pieces of legislation put into place to keep people
from China from entering the United States.[3] The government of
California endeavored to prevent Chinese immigrants from
working by requiring certain permits that they could not obtain,
and passed legislation to prevent naturalization.[2] Many turned to
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laundry"] laundry business, and in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco"] San Francisco about 89% of the
laundry workers were of Chinese descent. It was often the only job
they could find.
In 1880, the elected officials of the city of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco"] San Francisco passed an
ordinance making it illegal to operate a laundry in a wooden
building without a permit from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors"] Board of Supervisors. The
ordinance conferred upon the Board of Supervisors the discretion
to grant or withhold the permits. At the time, about 95% of the
city's  320 laundries were operated in wooden buildings.
Approximately two-thirds of those laundries were owned by

Case opinion
Yick Wo (Chinese: 
益和; Jyutping: jik1 wo4), was a laundry
facility owned by Lee Yick. Lee Yick immigrated to California in
1861. After 22 years of managing the facility, provisions set out by 
Majority Matthews, joined by
unanimous
Laws applied
the San Francisco Board of Supervisors said that he could not
continue to run it in a wooden building.[1] He continued to operate 
 U.S. Const. amend. XIV
his laundry and was convicted and fined ten dollars for violating the ordinance. He sued for a writ of
 habeas corpus after he was imprisoned in default for having refused to pay the fine.
San Francisco ordinance
Order No. 156, passed May 26, 1880
SEC. 1. It shall be unlawful, from and after the passage of this order, for any person or persons
to establish, maintain, or carry on a laundry within the corporate limits of the city and county
of San Francisco without having first obtained the consent of the board of supervisors, except
the same be located in a building constructed either of brick or stone.
SEC. 2. It shall be unlawful for any person to erect, build, or maintain, or cause to be erected,
built, or maintained, over or upon the roof of any building now erected or which may hereafter
be erected within the limits of said city and county, any scaffolding without first obtaining the
written permission of the board of supervisors, which permit shall state fully for what purpose
said scaffolding is to be erected and used, and such scaffolding shall not be used for any other
purpose than that designated in such permit.
SEC. 3. Any person who shall violate any of the provisions of this order shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more
than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment in the county jail, not more than six months, or
by both such fine and imprisonment.
Issue before the Court
The state argued that the ordinance was strictly one out of concern for safety, as laundries of the day often
needed very hot stoves to boil water for laundry, and indeed laundry fires were not unknown and often
resulted in the destruction of adjoining buildings as well. The petitioner pointed out that prior to the new
ordinance, the inspection and approval of laundries in wooden buildings had been left up to fire wardens.
Yick Wo's laundry had never failed an inspection for fire safety. Moreover, the application of the prior law
focused only on laundries in crowded areas of the city, while the new law was being enforced on isolated
wooden buildings as well. The law also ignored other wooden buildings where fires were common—even
cooking stoves posed the same risk as those used for laundries.
Opinion of the Court
Page 3
The Court, in a unanimous opinion written by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Matthews_(judge)"] Justice Matthews, found that the administration of the statute
in question was discriminatory and that there was therefore no need to even consider whether the ordinance
itself was lawful. Even though the Chinese laundry owners were usually not American citizens, the court
ruled they were still entitled to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Justice Matthews also
noted that the court had previously ruled that it was acceptable to hold administrators of the law liable when
they abused their authority. He denounced the law as an attempt to exclude Chinese from the laundry trade
in San Francisco, and the court struck down the law, ordering dismissal of all charges against other laundry
owners who had been jailed.[1]
The Court held that while the law wasn't discriminatory, it had been applied with "an evil eye and an
unequal hand" in singling out Chinese laundry business owner Yick Wo.[5]
Legacy
Yick Wo had little application shortly after the decision. In fact, it was not long after that the Court
developed the "separate but equal" doctrine in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson"] Plessy v. Ferguson,[6] in practice allowing discriminatory
treatment of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans"] African Americans. Yick Wo was never applied at the time to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws"] Jim Crow laws which, although
 also racially neutral, were in practice discriminatory against blacks. However, by the 1950s, the Warren
Court used the principle established in Yick Wo to strike down several attempts by states and municipalities
in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_South"] Deep South to limit the political rights of blacks. Yick Wo has been cited in well over 150 Supreme
Court cases since it was decided.
Yick Wo is cited in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirabayashi_v._United_States"] Hirabayashi v. United States[7] to recognize that: "Distinctions between citizens solely
based because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are
founded upon the doctrine of equality. For that reason, legislative classification or discrimination based on
race alone has often been held to be a denial of equal protection." However, the US Supreme Court upheld
the conviction of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Hirabayashi"] Gordon Hirabayashi, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American"] Japanese American who tested the curfew law and refused to
register for the forced internment of people of Japanese descent during [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"] World War II.
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco"] San Francisco there is a public school named [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yick_Wo_Alternative_Elementary_School"] Yick Wo Alternative Elementary School in honor of Yick
Wo.
