Brown v. Board of Education
Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954),[1]
was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_landmark_court_decisions_in_the_United_States"] landmark decision of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States"] U.S. Supreme Court in which the
court ruled that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state"] U.S. state laws establishing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation"] racial segregation in
 public schools are unconstitutional, even if the segregated schools
are otherwise equal in quality. The court's decision partially
overruled its 1896 decision [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson"] Plessy v. Ferguson, declaring that the
"separate but equal" notion was unconstitutional for American
public schools and educational facilities.[note 1] It paved the way
 for integration and was a major victory of the civil rights
movement,[3] and a model for many future [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_litigation"] impact litigation
cases.[4]
The underlying case began in 1951 when the public school system
 in Topeka, Kansas, refused to enroll local black resident Oliver
Brown's daughter at the elementary school closest to their home,
instead requiring her to ride a bus to a segregated black school
farther away. The Browns and twelve other local black families in
similar situations filed a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action"] class-action lawsuit in U.S. federal court
against the Topeka Board of Education, alleging that its
segregation policy was unconstitutional. A three-judge panel of the
 U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas rendered a verdict
against the Browns, relying on the precedent of Plessy v.
Ferguson,  in which the Supreme Court had ruled that racial
segregation was not in itself a violation of the Fourteenth
Amendment's Equal Protection Clause if the facilities in question
were otherwise equal, a doctrine that had come to be known as
"[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separate_but_equal"] separate but equal". The Browns, then represented by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP"] NAACP
chief counsel [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurgood_Marshall"] Thurgood Marshall, appealed the ruling directly to
the Supreme Court.
In May 1954, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous 9–0 decision
in favor of the Browns. The court ruled that "separate educational
facilities are inherently unequal", and therefore laws that impose
 them violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution"] U.S. Constitution. However, the decision's 14
pages did not spell out any sort of method for ending racial
segregation in schools, and the court's second decision in Brown II
 (349 U.S. 294 (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/349/29
4/) (1955)) only ordered states to desegregate "with all deliberate
speed".
In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"] Southern United States, especially the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_South"] Deep South", where
racial segregation was deeply entrenched, the reaction to Brown
among most white people was "noisy and stubborn".[5] Many

Background
For much of the 60 years preceding the Brown case, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_relations"] race relations
in the United States had been dominated by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation_in_the_United_States"] racial segregation.

that as long as the separate facilities for separate races were equal,
state segregation did not violate the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] Fourteenth Amendment ("no

Filing and arguments
In 1951, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-action"] class-action lawsuit was filed against the Board of Education of the City of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topeka,_Kansas"] Topeka, Kansas, in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Kansas"] United States District Court for the District of Kansas. The plaintiffs were thirteen Topeka parents on
behalf of their 20 children.[14]
The suit called for the school district to reverse its policy of racial segregation. The Topeka Board of
Education operated separate elementary schools due to a 1879 Kansas law, which permitted (but did not
require) districts to maintain separate elementary school facilities for black and white students in 12
communities with populations over 15,000. The plaintiffs had been recruited by the leadership of the
Topeka NAACP. Notable among the Topeka NAACP leaders were the chairman [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinley_Burnett"] McKinley Burnett;
Charles Scott, one of three serving as legal counsel for the chapter; and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucinda_Todd"] Lucinda Todd.
 The named African-American plaintiff, Oliver Brown, was a parent, a welder in the shops of the Santa Fe
Railroad, as well as an assistant pastor at his local church.[15] He was convinced to join the lawsuit by a
childhood friend, Charles Scott. Brown's daughter [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Carol_Brown"] Linda Carol Brown, a third grader, had to walk six
blocks to her school bus stop to ride to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education_National_Historical_Park"] Monroe Elementary, her segregated black school one mile (1.6 km)
away, while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumner_Elementary_School"] Sumner Elementary, a white school, was seven blocks from her house.[16][17]
As directed by the NAACP leadership, the parents each attempted to enroll their children in the closest
neighborhood school in the fall of 1951. They were each refused enrollment and redirected to the
segregated schools.
The case "Oliver Brown et al. v. The Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas" was named after Oliver
Brown as a legal strategy to have a man at the head of the roster. The lawyers, and the National Chapter of
the NAACP, also felt that having Mr. Brown at the head of the roster would be better received by the U.S.
Supreme Court justices. The 13 plaintiffs were: Oliver Brown, Darlene Brown, Lena Carper, Sadie
Emmanuel, Marguerite Emerson, Shirley Fleming, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelma_Henderson"] Zelma Henderson, Shirley Hodison, Maude Lawton,
Alma Lewis, Iona Richardson, Vivian Scales, and Lucinda Todd.[18] The last surviving plaintiff, Zelma
Henderson, died in Topeka, on May 20, 2008, at age 88.[19][20]
District court opinion
The District Court ruled in favor of the Board of Education, citing the U.S. Supreme Court precedent set in
Plessy v. Ferguson.[21] Judge [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Huxman"] Walter Huxman wrote the opinion for the three-judge District Court panel,
including nine "findings of fact", based on the evidence presented at trial. Although finding number eight
stated that segregation in public education has a detrimental effect on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro"] negro children, the court denied relief
on the ground that the negro and white schools in Topeka were substantially equal with respect to
buildings, transportation, curricula, and educational qualifications of teachers.[22][23] This finding would be
specifically cited in the subsequent Supreme Court opinion of this case.[24]
Supreme Court arguments
The case of Brown v. Board of Education as heard before the Supreme Court combined five cases: Brown
itself, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briggs_v._Elliott"] Briggs v. Elliott (filed in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina"] South Carolina), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_v._County_School_Board_of_Prince_Edward_County"] Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County
(filed in Virginia), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gebhart_v._Belton"] Gebhart v. Belton (filed in Delaware), and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolling_v._Sharpe"] Bolling v. Sharpe (filed in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."] Washington, D.C.).
All were NAACP-sponsored cases. The Davis case, the only case of the five originating from a student
 protest, began when 16-year-old Barbara Rose Johns organized and led a 450-student walkout of Moton
 High School.[25] The Gebhart case was the only one where a trial court, affirmed by the Delaware
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware"]
Page 5
 Supreme Court, found that discrimination was unlawful; in all the other cases the plaintiffs had lost as the
original courts had found discrimination to be lawful.
The Kansas case was unique among the group in that there was no contention of gross inferiority of the
segregated schools' physical plant, curriculum, or staff. The district court found substantial equality as to all
such factors. The lower court, in its opinion, noted that, in Topeka, "the physical facilities, the curricula,
courses of study, qualification and quality of teachers, as well as other educational facilities in the two sets
of schools [were] comparable."[26] The lower court observed that "colored children in many instances are
required to travel much greater distances than they would be required to travel could they attend a white
school" but also noted that the school district "transports colored children to and from school free of
charge" and that "no such service [was] provided to white children."[26] In the Delaware case the district
court judge in Gebhart ordered that the black students be admitted to the white high school due to the
substantial harm of segregation and the differences that made the separate schools unequal.
Under the leadership of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reuther"] Walter Reuther, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Auto_Workers"] United Auto Workers donated $75,000 to help pay for the
NAACP's efforts at the Supreme Court.[27] The NAACP's chief counsel, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurgood_Marshall"] Thurgood Marshall—who was
later appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967—argued the case before the Supreme Court for the
plaintiffs. Assistant attorney general Paul Wilson—later distinguished emeritus professor of law at the
 University of Kansas—conducted the state's ambivalent defense in his first appellate argument.
In December 1952, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice"] Justice Department filed a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend_of_the_court_brief"] friend of the court brief in the case. The brief was
unusual in its heavy emphasis on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_United_States"] foreign-policy considerations of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_administration"] Truman administration in a case
ostensibly about domestic issues. Of the seven pages covering "the interest of the United States", five
focused on the way school segregation hurt the United States in the Cold War competition for the
friendship and allegiance of non-white peoples in countries then gaining independence from colonial rule.
Attorney General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_P._McGranery"] James P. McGranery noted that "the existence of discrimination against minority groups
in the United States has an adverse effect upon our relations with other countries. Racial discrimination
furnishes grist for the Communist propaganda mills."[28] The brief also quoted a letter by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State"] Secretary of State
 Dean Acheson lamenting that "the United States is under constant attack in the foreign press, over the
foreign radio, and in such international bodies as the United Nations because of various practices of
discrimination in this country."[29]
British barrister and parliamentarian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Lester,_Baron_Lester_of_Herne_Hill"] Anthony Lester has written that "Although the Court's opinion in
Brown made no reference to these considerations of foreign policy, there is no doubt that they significantly
influenced the decision."[29]
Consensus building
In spring 1953, the court heard the case but was unable to decide
the issue and asked to rehear the case in fall 1953, with special
attention to whether the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection
Clause prohibited the operation of separate public schools for
whites and blacks.[30]
 The court reargued the case at the behest of Associate Justice Felix
Frankfurter, who used reargument as a stalling tactic, to allow the
court to gather a consensus around a Brown opinion that would
outlaw segregation. The justices in support of desegregation spent
much effort convincing those who initially intended to dissent to

Court that on May 17, 1954, ruled
unanimously that racial segregation
in public schools is unconstitutional.
Page 6
join a unanimous opinion. Although the legal effect would be same for a majority rather than unanimous
decision, it was felt that dissent could be used by segregation supporters as a legitimizing counter-argument.
Conference notes and draft decisions illustrate the division of opinions before the decision was issued.[31]
Justices [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_O._Douglas"] William O. Douglas, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Black"] Hugo Black, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Hitz_Burton"] Harold Hitz Burton, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Minton"] Sherman Minton were predisposed to
 overturn Plessy.[31] Fred M. Vinson noted that Congress had not adopted desegregation legislation; Stanley
F. Reed discussed incomplete [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation"] cultural assimilation and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States%27_rights"] states' rights, and was inclined to the view that
segregation worked to the benefit of the African-American community; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_C._Clark"] Tom C. Clark wrote that "we had
led the states on to think segregation is OK and we should let them work it out."[31] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Frankfurter"] Felix Frankfurter and
 Robert H. Jackson disapproved of segregation, but were also opposed to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_activism"] judicial activism and expressed
concerns about the proposed decision's enforceability.[31] Chief Justice Vinson had been a key stumbling
block. After Vinson died in September 1953, President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower"] Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Warren"] Earl Warren as
Chief Justice.[31] Warren had supported the integration of Mexican-American students in California school
systems following [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendez_v._Westminster"] Mendez v. Westminster.[32] However, Eisenhower invited Earl Warren to a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"] White House
dinner, where the president told him: "These [southern whites] are not bad people. All they are concerned
about is to see that their sweet little girls are not required to sit in school alongside some big overgrown
Negroes."[note 2] Nevertheless, the Justice Department sided with the African-American
plaintiffs.[34][35][36]
While all but one justice personally rejected segregation, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_restraint"] judicial restraint faction questioned whether
the Constitution gave the court the power to order its end. The activist faction believed the Fourteenth
Amendment did give the necessary authority and were pushing to go ahead. Warren, who held only a
 recess appointment, held his tongue until the Senate confirmed his appointment.
Warren convened a meeting of the justices, and presented to them the simple argument that the only reason
to sustain segregation was an honest belief in the inferiority of Negroes. Warren further submitted that the
court must overrule Plessy to maintain its legitimacy as an institution of liberty, and it must do so
unanimously to avoid massive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States"] Southern resistance. He began to build a unanimous opinion. Although most
justices were immediately convinced, Warren spent some time after this famous speech convincing
everyone to sign onto the opinion. Justice Jackson dropped his concurrence and Reed finally decided to
drop his dissent. The final decision was unanimous. Warren drafted the basic opinion and kept circulating
and revising it until he had an opinion endorsed by all the members of the court.[37] Reed was the last
holdout and reportedly cried during the reading of the opinion.[38]
Decision
On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous 9–0 decision in favor of the Brown family and
the other plaintiffs. The decision consists of a single opinion written by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States"] chief justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Warren"] Earl Warren, which all
the justices joined.[39]
The court's opinion began by noting that it had tried to determine whether the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] Fourteenth Amendment was
meant to abolish segregation in public education—even hearing a second round of oral arguments from the
parties' lawyers specifically on the historical sources—but to no avail.[39]
Reargument was largely devoted to the circumstances
surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth
Amendment in 1868. It covered exhaustively
consideration of the Amendment in Congress,
ratification by the states, then-existing practices in
racial segregation, and the views of proponents and
Page 7
opponents of the Amendment. This discussion and our
own investigation convince us that, although these
sources cast some light, it is not enough to resolve the
problem with which we are faced. At best, they are
inconclusive.
— Brown, 347 U.S. at 489.[40]
The court said that the question was complicated by the major
social and governmental changes that had taken place in the late
19th and early 20th centuries. The court observed that public
schools had been uncommon in the American South in the late
1860s. At that time, Southern white children whose families could
afford schooling usually attended private schools, while the
education of black children was "almost nonexistent", to the point
that in some Southern states any education of black people had
been forbidden by law.[41] The court contrasted this with the 
 Chief justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Warren"] Earl Warren, the author
of the court's unanimous opinion in
situation in 1954: "Today, education is perhaps the most important
function of our local and state governments."[42] The court 
Brown
concluded that, in making its ruling, it would have to "consider
public education in light of its full development and its present place in American life throughout the
Nation."[43]
During the segregation era, it was common for black schools to have fewer resources and poorer facilities
than white schools despite the equality required by the "separate but equal" doctrine. The Brown Court did
not address this issue, however, probably because some of the school districts involved had made
improvements to their black schools to "equalize" them with the quality of the white schools.[39] This
prevented the court from finding a violation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause"] Equal Protection Clause in "measurable inequalities"
between all white and black schools, and instead required it to look to the effects of segregation itself.[44]
Thus, the court framed the case around the more general question of whether the principle of "separate but
equal" was constitutional when applied to public education.[45]
We come then to the question presented: Does segregation of children in public schools solely
on the basis of race, even though the physical facilities and other "tangible" factors may be
equal, deprive the children of the minority group of equal educational opportunities?
— Brown, 397 U.S. at 493.[46]
In answer, the court held that it did.[47] It ruled that state-mandated segregation, even if implemented in
schools of otherwise equal quality, is inherently unequal because of its psychological impact.[47]
To separate [black children] from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of
their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect
their hearts and minds in a way unlikely to ever be undone.
— Brown, 347 U.S. at 494.[48]
The court supported this conclusion with citations—in a footnote, not the main text of the opinion—to
several psychological studies purporting to show that segregating black children made them feel inferior
and interfered with their learning.[47] These studies included those of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_and_Mamie_Clark"] Kenneth and Mamie Clark, whose

experiments in the 1940s had suggested that black American children from segregated environments
 preferred white dolls over black dolls.
The court then concluded its relatively short opinion by declaring that segregated public education was
inherently unequal, violated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause"] Equal Protection Clause, and therefore was unconstitutional:
We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of "separate but equal" has no
place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. Therefore, we hold that the
plaintiffs and others similarly situated for whom the actions have been brought are, by reason
of the segregation complained of, deprived of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by
the Fourteenth Amendment.
— Brown, 397 U.S. at 495.[48]
The court did not close with an order to implement the integration of the schools of the various
jurisdictions. Instead, it requested the parties re-appear before the court the following Term to hold
arguments on what the appropriate remedy should be.[47] This became the case known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_II"] Brown II,
described below.
Reaction and aftermath
Although Americans generally cheered the court's decision in Brown, most white Southerners decried it.
Many Southern white Americans viewed Brown as "a day of catastrophe—a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday"] Black Monday—a day
something like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor"] Pearl Harbor."[49] In the face of entrenched Southern opposition, progress on integrating
American schools moved slowly. The American political historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_G._McCloskey"] Robert G. McCloskey described:
The reaction of the white South to this judicial onslaught on its institutions was noisy and
stubborn. Certain "border states," which had formerly maintained segregated school systems,
did integrate, and others permitted the token admission of a few Negro students to schools that
had once been racially unmixed. However, the Deep South made no moves to obey the
judicial command, and in some districts there can be no doubt that the Desegregation decision
hardened resistance to integration proposals.[50]
In Virginia, Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_F._Byrd"] Harry F. Byrd organized the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_Resistance"] Massive Resistance movement that included the closing of
schools rather than desegregating them.[51]
For several decades after the Brown decision, African-American teachers, principals, and other school staff
who worked in segregated Black schools were fired or laid off as Southerners sought to create a system of
integrated schools with White leadership. According to historian Michael Fultz, "In many ways the South
moved faster, with more 'deliberate speed' in displacing Black educators than it did in desegregating
schools."[52]
Deep South
Texas Attorney General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ben_Shepperd"] John Ben Shepperd organized a campaign to generate legal obstacles to
implementation of desegregation.[53]
Page 9
In September 1957, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas"] Arkansas governor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orval_Faubus"] Orval Faubus called out the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Army_National_Guard"] Arkansas Army National Guard to
block the entry of nine black students, later known as the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock_Nine"] Little Rock Nine", after the desegregation of
 Little Rock Central High School. President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower"] Dwight D. Eisenhower responded by asserting federal control
over the Arkansas National Guard and deploying troops from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army"] U.S. Army's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101st_Airborne_Division"] 101st Airborne Division
stationed at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Campbell"] Fort Campbell to ensure the black students could safely register for and attend classes.[54]
Also in 1957, Florida's response was mixed. Its legislature passed an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interposition"] Interposition Resolution denouncing
the decision and declaring it null and void. But [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Florida"] Florida Governor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeRoy_Collins"] LeRoy Collins, though joining in the
protest against the court decision, refused to sign it, arguing that the attempt to overturn the ruling must be
done by legal methods.
In Mississippi, fear of violence prevented any plaintiff from bringing a school desegregation suit for the
next nine years.[55] When [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medgar_Evers"] Medgar Evers sued in 1963 to desegregate schools in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi"] Jackson, Mississippi,
 White Citizens Council member [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_De_La_Beckwith"] Byron De La Beckwith murdered him.[56] Two subsequent trials resulted
in hung juries. Beckwith was not convicted of the murder until 1994.[57]
 In June 1963, Alabama governor George Wallace personally blocked the door to the University of
Alabama's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_Auditorium"] Foster Auditorium to prevent the enrollment of two black students in what became known as the
"[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_in_the_Schoolhouse_Door"] Stand in the Schoolhouse Door" incident.[58][59] Wallace sought to uphold his "segregation now,
segregation tomorrow, segregation forever" promise he had given in his 1963 inaugural address. Wallace
moved aside only when confronted by General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_V._Graham"] Henry V. Graham of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_National_Guard"] Alabama National Guard, whom
President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy"] John F. Kennedy had ordered to intervene.
Native American communities were also heavily impacted by segregation laws with native children also
being prohibited from attending white institutions.[60] Native American children considered light-
complexioned were allowed to ride school buses to previously all white schools, while dark-skinned Native
children from the same band were still barred from riding the same buses.[60] Tribal leaders, having learned
about [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr."] Martin Luther King Jr.'s desegregation campaign in Birmingham, Alabama, contacted him for
assistance. King promptly responded to the tribal leaders and through his intervention the problem was
quickly resolved.[60]
Upper South
In North Carolina, there was often a strategy of nominally accepting Brown, but tacitly resisting it. On May
18, 1954, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro,_North_Carolina"] Greensboro, North Carolina school board declared that it would abide by the Brown ruling.
This was the result of the initiative of D. E. Hudgins Jr., a former Rhodes Scholar and prominent attorney,
who chaired the school board. This made Greensboro the first, and for years the only, city in the South, to
announce its intent to comply. However, others in the city resisted integration, putting up legal obstacles to
the actual implementation of school desegregation for years afterward, and in 1969, the federal government
found the city was not in compliance with the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Transition to a fully integrated school
system did not begin until 1971, after numerous local lawsuits and both nonviolent and violent
demonstrations. Historians have noted the irony that Greensboro, which had heralded itself as such a
progressive city, was one of the last holdouts for school desegregation.[61][62]
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moberly,_Missouri"] Moberly, Missouri, the schools were desegregated, as ordered. However, after 1955, the African-
American teachers from the local "negro school" were not retained; this was ascribed to poor performance.
They appealed their dismissal in Naomi Brooks et al., Appellants, v. School District of City of Moberly,
Missouri, Etc., et al.; but it was upheld, and SCOTUS declined to hear a further appeal.[63][64]
Page 10
Virginia had one of the companion cases in Brown,  involving the Prince Edward County schools.
Significant opposition to the Brown verdict included U.S. Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_F._Byrd"] Harry F. Byrd, who led the Byrd
Organization and promised a strategy of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_Resistance"] Massive Resistance. Governor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_B._Stanley"] Thomas Stanley, a member of the
Byrd Organization, appointed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_Commission"] Gray Commission, 32 Democrats led by state senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garland_Gray"] Garland Gray, to
study the issue and make recommendations. The commission recommended giving localities "broad
discretion" in meeting the new judicial requirements. However, in 1956, a special session of the Virginia
legislature adopted a legislative package which allowed the governor to simply close all schools under
desegregation orders from federal courts. In early 1958, newly elected Governor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Lindsay_Almond"] J. Lindsay Almond closed
public schools in Charlottesville, Norfolk, and Warren County rather than comply with desegregation
orders, leaving 10,000 children without schools despite efforts of various parent groups. However, he
reconsidered when on the Lee-Jackson state holiday, the Virginia Supreme Court ruled the closures violated
the state constitution, and a panel of federal judges ruled they violated the U.S. Constitution. In early
February 1959, both the Arlington County (also subject to a NAACP lawsuit, and which had lost its
elected school board pursuant to other parts of the Stanley Plan) and Norfolk schools desegregated
peacefully. Soon all counties reopened and integrated with the exception of Prince Edward County. That
took the extreme step of choosing not to appropriate any funding for its school system, thus forcing all its
public schools to close, although Prince Edward County provided tuition grants for all students, regardless
of their race, to use for private, nonsectarian education. Since no private schools existed for blacks within
the county, black children in the county either had to leave the county to receive any education between
1959 and 1963, or received no education. All private schools in the region remained racially segregated.
This lasted until 1964, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Prince Edward County's decision to provide
tuition grants for private schools that only admitted whites violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th
Amendment, in the case of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_v._County_School_Board_of_Prince_Edward_County"] Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County.[65]
North
Many Northern cities also had [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation#United_States"] de facto segregation policies, which resulted in a vast gulf in educational
resources between black and white communities. In Harlem, New York, for example, not a single new
 school had been built since the turn of the century, nor did a single nursery school exist, even as the Second
Great Migration caused overcrowding of existing schools. Existing schools tended to be dilapidated and
staffed with inexperienced teachers. Northern officials were in denial of the segregation, but Brown helped
stimulate activism among African-American parents like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_Mallory"] Mae Mallory who, with support of the NAACP,
initiated a successful lawsuit against the city and State of New York on Brown's principles. Mallory and
thousands of other parents bolstered the pressure of the lawsuit with a school boycott in 1959. During the
boycott, some of the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_schools"] freedom schools of the period were established. The city responded to the
campaign by permitting more open transfers to high-quality, historically-white schools. (New York's
African-American community, and Northern desegregation activists generally, now found themselves
contending with the problem of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_flight"] white flight, however.)[66][67]
Topeka
The Topeka junior high schools had been integrated since 1941. Topeka High School was integrated from
its inception in 1871 and its sports teams from 1949 onwards.[68] The Kansas law permitting segregated
schools allowed them only "below the high school level".[69]
Soon after the district court decision, election outcomes and the political climate in Topeka changed. The
Board of Education of Topeka began to end segregation in the Topeka elementary schools in August 1953,
integrating two attendance districts. All the Topeka elementary schools were changed to neighborhood
attendance centers in January 1956, although existing students were allowed to continue attending their
prior assigned schools at their option.[70][71][72] Plaintiff Zelma Henderson, in a 2004 interview, recalled
Page 11
that no demonstrations or tumult accompanied desegregation in
Topeka's schools: "They accepted it ... It wasn't too long until they
integrated the teachers and principals."[73]
The Topeka Public Schools administration building is named in
honor of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinley_Burnett"] McKinley Burnett, NAACP chapter president who
organized the case.[74]
 Monroe Elementary was designated a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Historic_Site_(United_States)"] National Historic Site under
the National Park Service on October 26, 1992, and redesignated a
National Historical Park on May 12, 2022.
The intellectual roots of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson"] Plessy v. Ferguson, the landmark United
States Supreme Court decision upholding the constitutionality of
 racial segregation in 1896 under the doctrine of "separate but
equal" were, in part, tied to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism"] scientific racism of the era.[75][76]
However, the popular support for the decision was more likely a
result of the racist beliefs held by many whites at the time.[77] In
deciding Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court rejected
the ideas of scientific racists about the need for segregation,
especially in schools. The court buttressed its holding by citing (in
 footnote 11 (http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=
US&vol=347&invol=483#f11)) social science research about the
harms to black children caused by segregated schools. 
Judgment and order of the Supreme
Court for the case
Both scholarly and popular ideas of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditarianism"] hereditarianism played an important role in the attack and backlash that
followed the Brown decision.[77] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mankind_Quarterly"] Mankind Quarterly was founded in 1960, in part in response to the
Brown decision.[78][79]
Legal criticism and praise
 William Rehnquist wrote a memo titled "A Random Thought on
 the Segregation Cases" when he was a law clerk for Justice Robert
H. Jackson in 1952, during early deliberations that led to the Brown
v. Board of Education decision. In his memo, Rehnquist argued: "I
realize that it is an unpopular and unhumanitarian position, for
which I have been excoriated by 'liberal' colleagues but I think
 Plessy v. Ferguson was right and should be reaffirmed." Rehnquist
continued, "To the argument ... that a majority may not deprive a
minority of its constitutional right, the answer must be made that
while this is sound in theory, in the long run it is the majority who
will determine what the constitutional rights of the minorities
are."[80] Rehnquist also argued for Plessy with other law clerks.[81] 
 U.S. circuit judges (from left to right)
 Robert A. Katzmann, Damon J.
Keith, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor"] Sonia Sotomayor at a
 2004 exhibit on the Fourteenth
However, during his 1971 confirmation hearings, Rehnquist said,
"I believe that the memorandum was prepared by me as a statement 
Amendment, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurgood_Marshall"] Thurgood Marshall, and
Brown v. Board of Education
of Justice Jackson's tentative views for his own use." Jackson had
initially planned to join a dissent in Brown.[82] Later, at his 1986 hearings for the slot of Chief Justice,
Rehnquist put further distance between himself and the 1952 memo: "The bald statement that Plessy was
right and should be reaffirmed, was not an accurate reflection of my own views at the time."[83] In any
event, while serving on the Supreme Court, Rehnquist made no effort to reverse or undermine the Brown
Page 12
decision, and frequently relied upon it as precedent.[84][85]
Chief Justice Warren's reasoning was broadly criticized by contemporary legal academics with Judge
 Learned Hand decrying that the Supreme Court had "assumed the role of a third legislative chamber"[86]
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Wechsler"] Herbert Wechsler finding Brown impossible to justify based on neutral principles.[87]
Some aspects of the Brown decision are still debated. Notably, Supreme Court Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas"] Clarence Thomas,
himself an African American, wrote in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_v._Jenkins"] Missouri v. Jenkins (1995) that at the very least, Brown I has been
misunderstood by the courts.
Brown I did not say that "racially isolated" schools were inherently inferior; the harm that it
identified was tied purely to de jure segregation, not de facto segregation. Indeed, Brown I
itself did not need to rely upon any psychological or social-science research in order to
announce the simple, yet fundamental truth that the Government cannot discriminate among its
citizens on the basis of race. …
Segregation was not unconstitutional because it might have caused psychological feelings of
inferiority. Public school systems that separated blacks and provided them with superior
educational resources making blacks "feel" superior to whites sent to lesser schools—would
violate the Fourteenth Amendment, whether or not the white students felt stigmatized, just as
do school systems in which the positions of the races are reversed. Psychological injury or
benefit is irrelevant …
Given that desegregation has not produced the predicted leaps forward in black educational
achievement, there is no reason to think that black students cannot learn as well when
surrounded by members of their own race as when they are in an integrated environment. (…)
Because of their "distinctive histories and traditions," black schools can function as the center
and symbol of black communities, and provide examples of independent black leadership,
success, and achievement.[88]
Some Constitutional originalists, notably [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Berger"] Raoul Berger in his influential 1977 book "Government by
Judiciary," make the case that Brown cannot be defended by reference to the original understanding of the
 14th Amendment. They support this reading of the 14th Amendment by noting that the Civil Rights Act of
1875 did not ban segregated schools and that the same Congress that passed the 14th Amendment also
voted to segregate schools in the District of Columbia. Other originalists, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_W._McConnell"] Michael W. McConnell,
a federal judge on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Tenth_Circuit"] United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in his article "Originalism and
the Desegregation Decisions," argue that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era_of_the_United_States"] Radical Reconstructionists who spearheaded the 14th
Amendment were in favor of desegregated southern schools.[89] Evidence supporting this interpretation of
the 14th Amendment has come from archived Congressional records showing that proposals for federal
legislation which would enforce school integration were debated in Congress a few years following the
amendment's ratification.[90]
In response to Michael McConnell's research, Raoul Berger argued that the Congressmen and Senators
who were advocating in favor of school desegregation in the 1870s were trying to rewrite the 14th
Amendment in order to make the 14th Amendment fit their political agenda and that the actual
understanding of the 14th Amendment from 1866 to 1868 (which is when the 14th Amendment was
actually passed and ratified) does, in fact, permit [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_states"] US states to have segregated schools.[91] Berger criticized
McConnell for being unable to find any reference to school segregation—let alone any reference to a desire
to prohibit it—among supporters of the 14th Amendment in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Globe"] congressional history of this amendment
(specifically in the recordings of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/39th_United_States_Congress"] 39th United States Congress, since that was the US Congress that
actually passed the 14th Amendment) and also criticized McConnell's view that the 1954 view of "civil
Page 13
rights" should be decisive in interpreting the 14th Amendment as opposed to the 1866 view of "civil
rights."[91] Berger also argues that McConnell failed to provide any evidence that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)"] state legislatures who
ratified the 14th Amendment understood it at the time as prohibiting school segregation and that whenever
the question of school segregation's compatibility with the US Constitution (as opposed to the separate
question of school segregation's compatibility with US state law and/or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_state_constitutions"] US state constitutions, where courts
have often ruled against school segregation) reached the judiciary in the couple of decades after the passage
and ratification of the 14th Amendment (whether in Ohio, Nevada, California, Indiana, or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)"] New York),
courts have always affirmed the constitutionality of school segregation—as did [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Supreme_Court"] Michigan Supreme Court
 Chief Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_M._Cooley"] Thomas M. Cooley in his 1880 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise"] treatise The General Principles of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Law"] Constitutional Law in the
United States of America.[91] In addition, Berger argues that the views of the draftsmen of the 14th
Amendment in 1866 are decisive—as opposed to the views of later readers of the 14th Amendment
(including the views of supporters of the 14th Amendment after this amendment's passage and ratification
due to the fact that even their views and beliefs about the meaning and scope of this Amendment could and
sometimes did change over time—like with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_U.S._Senator"] Nevada U.S. Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris_Stewart"] William Morris Stewart, who initially
opposed school desegregation but later changed his mind and supported it).[91] To back up his view about
original intent being decisive, Berger cites—among other things—an 1871 quote by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_A._Garfield"] James A. Garfield to
 John Bingham where Garfield challenged Bingham's recollection of a statement that Bingham had
previously made in 1866—with Garfield telling Bingham that he can make but not unmake history.[91]
The case also has attracted some criticism from more liberal authors, including some who say that Chief
Justice Warren's reliance on psychological criteria to find a harm against segregated blacks was
unnecessary. For example, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_S._Days"] Drew S. Days has written:[92] "we have developed criteria for evaluating the
constitutionality of racial classifications that do not depend upon findings of psychic harm or social science
evidence. They are based rather on the principle that 'distinctions between citizens solely because of their
ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of
equality,' [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirabayashi_v._United_States"] Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81 (1943). . . ."
In his book The Tempting of America (page 82), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bork"] Robert Bork endorsed the Brown decision as follows:
By 1954, when Brown came up for decision, it had been apparent for some time that
segregation rarely if ever produced equality. Quite aside from any question of psychology, the
physical facilities provided for blacks were not as good as those provided for whites. That had
been demonstrated in a long series of cases … The Court's realistic choice, therefore, was
either to abandon the quest for equality by allowing segregation or to forbid segregation in
order to achieve equality. There was no third choice. Either choice would violate one aspect of
the original understanding, but there was no possibility of avoiding that. Since equality and
segregation were mutually inconsistent, though the ratifiers did not understand that, both could
not be honored. When that is seen, it is obvious the Court must choose equality and prohibit
state-imposed segregation. The purpose that brought the fourteenth amendment into being was
equality before the law, and equality, not separation, was written into the law.
In June 1987, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Elman"] Philip Elman, a civil rights attorney who served as an associate in the Solicitor General's
office during Harry Truman's term, claimed he and Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter were mostly
responsible for the Supreme Court's decision, and stated that the NAACP's arguments did not present
strong evidence.[93] Elman has been criticized for offering a self-aggrandizing history of the case, omitting
important facts, and denigrating the work of civil rights attorneys who had laid the groundwork for the
decision over many decades.[94] However, Frankfurter was also known for being one of court's most
outspoken advocates of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_restraint"] judicial restraint philosophy of basing court rulings on existing law rather than
personal or political considerations.[95][96] Public officials in the United States today are nearly unanimous
in lauding the ruling. In May 2004, the fiftieth anniversary of the ruling, President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush"] George W. Bush spoke
Page 14
at the opening of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Board_of_Education_National_Historical_Park"] Brown v. Board of Education National Historic Site, calling Brown "a decision that
changed America for the better, and forever."[97] Most Senators and Representatives issued press releases
hailing the ruling.
In a 2016 article in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townhall"] Townhall.com, an outlet of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem_Media_Group"] Salem Media Group, economist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sowell"] Thomas Sowell argued
that when Chief Justice Earl Warren declared in the landmark 1954 case of Brown v. Board of Education
that racially separate schools were "inherently unequal", [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar_High_School_(Washington,_D.C.)"] Dunbar High School was a living refutation of that
assumption. And it was within walking distance of the Supreme Court." In Sowell's estimation, "Dunbar,
which had been accepting outstanding black students from anywhere in the city, could now accept only
students from the rough ghetto neighborhood in which it was located" as a detrimental consequence of the
SCOTUS decision.[98]
Brown II
In 1955, the Supreme Court considered arguments by the schools requesting relief concerning the task of
desegregation. In their decision, which became known as "Brown II"[99] the court delegated the task of
carrying out school desegregation to district courts with orders that desegregation occur "with all deliberate
speed," a phrase traceable to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Thompson"] Francis Thompson's poem "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hound_of_Heaven"] The Hound of Heaven".[100]
Supporters of the earlier decision were displeased with this decision. The language "all deliberate speed"
was seen by critics as too ambiguous to ensure reasonable haste for compliance with the court's instruction.
Many Southern states and school districts interpreted "Brown II" as legal justification for resisting,
delaying, and avoiding significant integration for years—and in some cases for a decade or more—using
such tactics as closing down school systems, using state money to finance segregated "private" schools, and
"token" integration where a few carefully selected black children were admitted to former white-only
schools but the vast majority remained in underfunded, unequal black schools.[101]
For example, based on "Brown II", the U.S. District Court ruled that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Edward_County,_Virginia"] Prince Edward County, Virginia did
not have to desegregate immediately. When faced with a court order to finally begin desegregation in 1959
the county board of supervisors stopped appropriating money for public schools, which remained closed for
five years, from 1959 to 1964.
White students in the county were given assistance to attend white-only "private academies" that were
taught by teachers formerly employed by the public school system, while black students had no education
at all unless they moved out of the county. But the public schools reopened after the Supreme Court
overturned "Brown II" in Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, declaring that "...the
time for mere 'deliberate speed' has run out", and that the county must provide a public school system for all
children regardless of race.[102]
Brown III
In 1978, Topeka attorneys Richard Jones, Joseph Johnson and Charles Scott Jr. (son of the original Brown
team member), with assistance from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union"] American Civil Liberties Union, persuaded Linda Brown Smith—
who now had her own children in Topeka schools—to be a plaintiff in reopening Brown. They were
concerned that the Topeka Public Schools' policy of "open enrollment" had led to and would lead to further
segregation. They also believed that with a choice of open enrollment, white parents would shift their
children to "preferred" schools that would create both predominantly African-American and predominantly
European-American schools within the district. The district court reopened the Brown case after a 25-year
hiatus, but denied the plaintiffs' request finding the schools "unitary". In 1989, a three-judge panel of the
 Tenth Circuit on 2–1 vote found that the vestiges of segregation remained with respect to student and staff
Page 15
assignment.[103] In 1993, the Supreme Court denied the appellant School District's request for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certiorari"] certiorari
and returned the case to District Court Judge Richard Rodgers for implementation of the Tenth Circuit's
mandate.
After a 1994 plan was approved and a bond issue passed, additional elementary magnet schools were
opened and district attendance plans redrawn, which resulted in the Topeka schools meeting court standards
of racial balance by 1998. Unified status was eventually granted to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topeka_Unified_School_District_No._501"] Topeka Unified School District No. 501
on July 27, 1999.[104] One of the new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_schools"] magnet schools is named after the Scott family attorneys for their
role in the Brown case and civil rights.[105]
Other comments
A PBS film called "Simple Justice" retells the story of the Brown vs. Board of Education case, beginning
with the work of the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund's efforts to combat 'separate but equal' in graduate
school education and culminating in the historical 1954 decision.
 Linda Brown Thompson later recalled the experience of being refused enrollment:[106]
...we lived in an integrated neighborhood and I had all of these playmates of different
nationalities. And so when I found out that day that I might be able to go to their school, I was
just thrilled, you know. And I remember walking over to Sumner school with my dad that day
and going up the steps of the school and the school looked so big to a smaller child. And I
remember going inside and my dad spoke with someone and then he went into the inner office
with the principal and they left me out ... to sit outside with the secretary. And while he was in
the inner office, I could hear voices and hear his voice raised, you know, as the conversation
went on. And then he immediately came out of the office, took me by the hand and we walked
home from the school. I just couldn't understand what was happening because I was so sure
that I was going to go to school with Mona and Guinevere, Wanda, and all of my
playmates.[107]
Linda Brown died on March 25, 2018, at the age of 76.[108]

Notes
1. Brown and several subsequent Supreme Court decisions have severely weakened Plessy
v. Ferguson to the point that it is generally considered to have been de facto overruled.[2]
2. One source gives Eisenhower's quote as saying "big black bucks" instead of "big overgrown
Negroes".[33]

August 23, 2005. Here is what Rehnquist said in 1986 about his conversations with other
clerks about Plessy:
I thought Plessy had been wrongly decided at the time, that it was not a good
interpretation of the equal protection clause to say that when you segregate
people by race, there is no denial of equal protection. But Plessy had been on
the books for 60 years; Congress had never acted, and the same Congress that
had promulgated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] 14th Amendment had required segregation in the District
schools. . . . I saw factors on both sides. . . . I did not agree then, and I certainly do
not agree now, with the statement that Plessy against Ferguson is right and
should be reaffirmed. I had ideas on both sides, and I do not think I ever really
finally settled in my own mind on that. . . . [A]round the lunch table I am sure I
defended it. . . . I thought there were good arguments to be made in support of it.

of Justice William Hubbs Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of the United States (July 29, 30, 31,
and August 1, 1986).
82. Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_O._Douglas"] William O. Douglas wrote: "In the original conference there were only four who voted
that segregation in the public schools was unconstitutional. Those four were Black, Burton,
 Minton, and myself." See Bernard Schwartz, Decision: How the Supreme Court Decides
Cases (https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5cUCl4hSWUC&pg=PA96), page 96 (Oxford
1996). Likewise, Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Frankfurter"] Felix Frankfurter wrote: "I have no doubt that if the segregation
cases had reached decision last term, there would have been four dissenters—Vinson,
Reed, Jackson, and Clark." Id. Justice Jackson's longtime legal secretary had a different
view, calling Rehnquist's Senate testimony an attempt to "smear the reputation of a great
 justice." See Alan Dershowitz, Telling the Truth About Chief Justice Rehnquist (https://www.
