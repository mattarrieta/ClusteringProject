Korematsu v. United States
 Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944), was a landmark
decision by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States"] Supreme Court of the United States to uphold the
exclusion of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Americans"] Japanese Americans from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States"] West Coast Military
Area during [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"] World War II. The decision has been widely
criticized,[1] with some scholars describing it as "an odious and
discredited artifact of popular bigotry",[2] and as "a stain on
American jurisprudence".[3] Chief Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roberts"] John Roberts explicitly
repudiated the Korematsu decision in his majority opinion in the
2018 case of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._Hawaii"] Trump v. Hawaii.[4] The case is often cited as one of
the worst Supreme Court decisions of all time.[5][6][7]
In the aftermath of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan"] Imperial Japan's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor"] attack on Pearl Harbor,
President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt"] Franklin D. Roosevelt had issued [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_9066"] Executive Order 9066
on February 19, 1942, authorizing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._War_Department"] U.S. War Department to
create military areas from which any or all Americans might be
 excluded. Subsequently, the Western Defense Command, a U.S.
Army military command charged with coordinating the defense of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States"] West Coast of the United States, ordered "all persons of
 Japanese ancestry, including aliens and non-aliens" to relocate to
internment camps. However, a 23-year-old Japanese-American
man, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Korematsu"] Fred Korematsu, refused to leave the exclusion zone and
instead challenged the order on the grounds that it violated the
 Fifth Amendment.
In a majority opinion joined by five other justices, Associate
Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Black"] Hugo Black held that the need to protect against espionage
by Japan outweighed the rights of Americans of Japanese ancestry.
Black wrote that "Korematsu was not excluded from the Military
Area because of hostility to him or his race", but rather "because
the properly constituted military authorities ...  decided that the
military urgency of the situation demanded that all citizens of
Japanese ancestry be segregated from the West Coast" during the
 war against Japan. Dissenting justices Frank Murphy, Robert H.
Jackson, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_J._Roberts"] Owen J. Roberts all criticized the exclusion as
 racially discriminatory; Murphy wrote that the exclusion of
Japanese "falls into the ugly abyss of racism" and resembled "the
abhorrent and despicable treatment of minority groups by the
dictatorial tyrannies which this nation is now pledged to destroy."
The Korematsu opinion was the first instance in which the
Supreme Court applied the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strict_scrutiny"] strict scrutiny standard of review to
racial discrimination by the government; it is one of only a handful
of cases in which the Court held that the government met that
standard. Korematsu's conviction was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(law)"] voided by a California
 district court in 1983 on the grounds that Solicitor General Charles

issued [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_9066"] Executive Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, authorizing the
War Department to create military areas from which any or all
Americans might be excluded, and to provide for the necessary
transport, lodging, and feeding of persons displaced from such
 areas. On March 2, 1942, the U.S. Army Lieutenant General John
L. DeWitt, commander of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Defense_Command"] Western Defense Command, issued
Public Proclamation No. 1, demarcating western military areas and
the exclusion zones therein, and directing any "Japanese, German,
or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Americans"] Italian aliens" and any person of Japanese ancestry to inform the
U.S. Postal Service of any changes of residence.[8] Further military
areas and zones were demarcated in Public Proclamation No. 2.
Page 3
In the meantime, Secretary of War [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_L._Stimson"] Henry L. Stimson mailed to Senator [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rice_Reynolds"] Robert Rice Reynolds and House
Speaker [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Rayburn"] Sam Rayburn draft legislation authorizing the enforcement of Executive Order 9066. By March
21, Congress had enacted the proposed legislation, which Roosevelt signed into law.[9] On March 24,
1942, Western Defense Command began issuing Civilian Exclusion orders, commanding that "all persons
of Japanese ancestry, including aliens and non-aliens" report to designated assembly points. With the
issuance of Civilian Restrictive Order No. 1 on May 19, 1942, Japanese Americans were forced to move
into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_camp"] relocation camps.[10]
Meanwhile, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Korematsu"] Fred Korematsu was a 23-year-old Japanese-American man who decided to stay at his
residence in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Leandro,_California"] San Leandro, California, instead of obeying the order to relocate; however, he knowingly
violated Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34 of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Army"] U.S. Army, even undergoing plastic surgery in an attempt
to conceal his identity.[11] Korematsu argued that Executive Order 9066 was unconstitutional and that it
violated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution"] Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Fifth Amendment was selected over
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_of_the_United_States_Constitution"] Fourteenth Amendment due to the lack of federal protections in the Fourteenth Amendment. He was
 arrested and convicted. No question was raised as to Korematsu's loyalty to the United States. The Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit eventually affirmed his conviction,[12] and the Supreme Court granted
 certiorari.
Decision
Black's majority opinion
The decision of the case, written by Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Black"] Hugo Black, found the case
 largely indistinguishable from the previous year's Hirabayashi v. United
States decision, and rested largely on the same principle: deference to
Congress and the military authorities, particularly in light of the uncertainty
following Pearl Harbor. Justice Black further denied that the case had
anything to do with racial prejudice:
Korematsu was not excluded from the Military Area because
of hostility to him or his race. He was excluded because we
are at war with the Japanese Empire, because the properly
constituted military authorities feared an invasion of our West
Coast and felt constrained to take proper security measures,
because they decided that the military urgency of the situation
demanded that all citizens of Japanese ancestry be segregated
from the West Coast temporarily, and, finally, because
Congress, reposing its confidence in this time of war in our
military leaders—as inevitably it must—determined that they
should have the power to do just this.[13] 
Justice Hugo Black
In his diaries, Justice Felix Frankfurter reported that Justice Black told the justices as reason for deferring to
the executive branch: "Somebody must run this war. It is either Roosevelt or us. And we cannot."[14]
While Korematsu is regularly described as upholding the internment of Japanese Americans, the majority
opinion expressly declined to reach the issue of internment on the ground that Korematsu's conviction did
not present that issue, which it said raised different questions. The Court cross-referenced its decision the
same day in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex_parte_Endo"] Ex Parte Endo, 323 U.S. 283 (1944), in which the Court ruled that a loyal Japanese American
must be released from detention.[15]
Page 4
Frankfurter's concurrence
Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Frankfurter"] Frankfurter's concurrence reads in its entirety:
According to my reading of Civilian Exclusion Order No. 34, it
was an offense for Korematsu to be found in Military Area No.
1, the territory wherein he was previously living, except within
the bounds of the established Assembly Center of that area.
Even though the various orders issued by General DeWitt be
deemed a comprehensive code of instructions, their tenor is
clear, and not contradictory. They put upon Korematsu the
obligation to leave Military Area No. 1, but only by the method
prescribed in the instructions, i.e., by reporting to the
Assembly Center. I am unable to see how the legal
considerations that led to the decision in Hirabayashi v.  Justice Felix Frankfurter
United States, 320 U.S. 81, fail to sustain the military order
which made the conduct now in controversy a crime. And so I
join in the opinion of the Court, but should like to add a few words of my own.
The provisions of the Constitution which confer on the Congress and the President powers
to enable this country to wage war are as much part of the Constitution as provisions
looking to a nation at peace. And we have had recent occasion to quote approvingly the
statement of former Chief Justice Hughes that the war power of the Government is "the
power to wage war successfully". Hirabayashi v. United States, supra, at 93, and see
Home Bldg. & L. Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 426. Therefore, the validity of action
under the war power must be judged wholly in the context of war. That action is not to be
stigmatized as lawless because like action in times of peace would be lawless. To talk
about a military order that expresses an allowable judgment of war needs by those
entrusted with the duty of conducting war as "an [p. 225] unconstitutional order" is to
suffuse a part of the Constitution with an atmosphere of unconstitutionality. The respective
spheres of action of military authorities and of judges are, of course, very different. But,
within their sphere, military authorities are no more outside the bounds of obedience to the
Constitution than are judges within theirs. "The war power of the United States, like its
other powers... is subject to applicable constitutional limitations", Hamilton v. Kentucky
Distilleries Co., 251 U.S. 146, 156. To recognize that military orders are "reasonably
expedient military precautions" in time of war, and yet to deny them constitutional
legitimacy, makes of the Constitution an instrument for dialectic subtleties not reasonably
to be attributed to the hard-headed Framers, of whom a majority had had actual
participation in war. If a military order such as that under review does not transcend the
means appropriate for conducting war, such action by the military is as constitutional as
would be any authorized action by the Interstate Commerce Commission within the limits
of the constitutional power to regulate commerce. And, being an exercise of the war power
explicitly granted by the Constitution for safeguarding the national life by prosecuting war
effectively, I find nothing in the Constitution which denies to Congress the power to enforce
such a valid military order by making its violation an offense triable in the civil courts.
Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v. Brimson, 154 U.S. 447; 155 U.S. 3, and
Monongahela Bridge Co. v. United States, 216 U.S. 177. To find that the Constitution does
not forbid the military measures now complained of does not carry with it approval of that
which Congress and the Executive did. That is their business, not ours.[13]
Murphy's dissent
Page 5
Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Murphy"] Frank Murphy issued a vehement dissent, saying that the exclusion
of Japanese "falls into the ugly abyss of racism",  and resembles "the
abhorrent and despicable treatment of minority groups by the dictatorial
tyrannies which this nation is now pledged to destroy."[13] Murphy argued
that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_punishment"] collective punishment for Japanese Americans was an unconstitutional
response to any disloyalty that might have been found in a minority of their
cohort. He also compared the treatment of Japanese Americans with the
treatment of Americans of German and Italian ancestry, as evidence that
race, and not emergency alone, led to the exclusion order which Korematsu
was convicted of violating:
I dissent, therefore, from this legalization of racism. Racial
discrimination in any form and in any degree has no justifiable
part whatever in our democratic way of life. It is unattractive in
any setting, but it is utterly revolting among a free people who
have embraced the principles set forth in the Constitution of
the United States. All residents of this nation are kin in some
way by blood or culture to a foreign land. Yet they are
primarily and necessarily a part of the new and distinct
civilization of the United States. They must, accordingly, be
treated at all times as the heirs of the American experiment,
and as entitled to all the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the
Constitution.[13] 
Justice Frank Murphy
Justice Murphy's two uses of the term "racism" in this opinion, along with two additional uses in his
concurrence in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steele_v._Louisville_%26_Nashville_Railway_Co."] Steele v. Louisville & Nashville Railway Co., decided the same day, are among the first
appearances of the word "racism" in a United States Supreme Court opinion. The first appearance was in
 Justice Murphy's concurrence in Ex parte Endo, 323 U.S. 283 (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/
323/283/) (1944).[15] The term was also used in other cases, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_v._Kahanamoku"] Duncan v. Kahanamoku, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_327"] 327 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Reports"] U.S.
 304 (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/327/304/) (1946) and Oyama v. California, 332 U.S. 633
(https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/332/633/) (1948). It then disappeared from the court's lexicon
[URL: "https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/383/131/"] for 18 years—it reappeared in Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U.S. 131 (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/u
 s/383/131/) (1966). It did not appear in Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1 (https://supreme.justia.com/cases/fede
ral/us/388/1/) (1967),[16] even though that case did talk about racial discrimination and interracial
marriages.
Justice Murphy's dissent is considered the strongest of the three dissenting opinions and, since the 1980s,
has been cited as part of modern jurisprudence's categorical rejection of the majority opinion.[17]
Roberts's dissent
 Justice Roberts's dissent also acknowledges the racism inherent in the case although he does not use the
word. He recognized that the defendant was being punished based solely upon his ancestry:
This is not a case of keeping people off the streets at night, as
was Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, [p. 226] nor a
case of temporary exclusion of a citizen from an area for his
own safety or that of the community, nor a case of offering
him an opportunity to go temporarily out of an area where his
Page 6
presence might cause danger to himself or to his fellows. On
the contrary, it is the case of convicting a citizen as a
punishment for not submitting to imprisonment in a
concentration camp, based on his ancestry, and solely because
of his ancestry, without evidence or inquiry concerning his
loyalty and good disposition towards the United States. If this
be a correct statement of the facts disclosed by this record, and
facts of which we take judicial notice, I need hardly labor the
conclusion that Constitutional rights have been violated.[13]
Jackson's dissent
By contrast, Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Jackson"] Robert Jackson's dissent argued that "defense measures
will not, and often should not, be held within the limits that bind civil
authority in peace", and that it would perhaps be unreasonable to hold the
military, who issued the exclusion order, to the same standards of
constitutionality that apply to the rest of the government. "In the very nature
of things", he wrote, "military decisions are not susceptible of intelligent
judicial appraisal." He acknowledged the Court's powerlessness in that
regard, writing that "courts can never have any real alternative to accepting
the mere declaration of the authority that issued the order that it was
reasonably necessary from a military viewpoint."[13]
He nonetheless dissented, writing that, even if the courts should not be put
in the position of second-guessing or interfering with the orders of military
commanders, that does not mean that they should have to ratify or enforce
those orders if they are unconstitutional. Jackson writes, "I do not think [the
civil courts] may be asked to execute a military expedient that has no place
in law under the Constitution. I would reverse the judgment and discharge
the prisoner."[18] Indeed, he warns that the precedent of Korematsu might
last well beyond the war and the internment: 
Justice Owen Roberts
Justice Robert Jackson
A military order, however unconstitutional, is not apt to last longer than the military
emergency. Even during that period, a succeeding commander may revoke it all. But once a
judicial opinion rationalizes such an order to show that it conforms to the Constitution, or
rather rationalizes the Constitution to show that the Constitution sanctions such an order, the
Court for all time has validated the principle of racial discrimination in criminal procedure and
of transplanting American citizens. The principle then lies about like a loaded weapon, ready
for the hand of any authority that can bring forward a plausible claim of an urgent need. Every
repetition imbeds that principle more deeply in our law and thinking and expands it to new
purposes.[13]
Jackson further warned:
Of course the existence of a military power resting on force, so vagrant, so centralized, so
necessarily heedless of the individual, is an inherent threat to liberty. But I would not lead
people to rely on this Court for a review that seems to me wholly delusive. The military
reasonableness of these orders can only be determined by military superiors. If the people ever
Page 7
let command of the war power fall into irresponsible and unscrupulous hands, the courts wield
no power equal to its restraint. The chief restraint upon those who command the physical
forces of the country, in the future as in the past, must be their responsibility to the political
judgments of their contemporaries and to the moral judgments of history.[13]
Jackson acknowledged the racial issues at hand, writing:
Korematsu was born on our soil, of parents born in Japan. The Constitution makes him a
citizen of the United States by nativity and a citizen of California by residence. No claim is
made that he is not loyal to this country. There is no suggestion that apart from the matter
involved here he is not law abiding and well disposed. Korematsu, however, has been
convicted of an act not commonly a crime. It consists merely of being present in the state
whereof he is a citizen, near the place where he was born, and where all his life he has lived.
[...] [H]is crime would result, not from anything he did, said, or thought, different than they,
but only in that he was born of different racial stock. Now, if any fundamental assumption
underlies our system, it is that guilt is personal and not inheritable. Even if all of one's
antecedents had been convicted of treason, the Constitution forbids its penalties to be visited
upon him. But here is an attempt to make an otherwise innocent act a crime merely because
this prisoner is the son of parents as to whom he had no choice, and belongs to a race from
which there is no way to resign. If Congress in peace-time legislation should enact such a
criminal law, I should suppose this Court would refuse to enforce it.[13]
Subsequent history
Congressional Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of
Civilians
In 1980, Congress established a commission to evaluate the events leading up to the issuance of Executive
Order 9066 and accompanying military directives and their impact on citizens and resident aliens, charging
the commission with recommending remedies. Discussing the Korematsu decision in their 1982 report
entitled Personal Justice Denied, this Congressional Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of
Civilians (CCWRIC) concluded that "each part of the decision, questions of both factual review and legal
principles, has been discredited or abandoned," and that, "Today the decision in Korematsu lies overruled
in the court of history."[19][20]
Conviction overturned
 Korematsu challenged his conviction in 1983 by filing before the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California a writ of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coram_nobis"] coram nobis, which asserted that the original conviction was so
flawed as to represent a grave injustice that should be reversed. As evidence, he submitted the conclusions
of the CCWRIC report as well as newly-discovered internal Justice Department communications
demonstrating that evidence contradicting the military necessity for the Executive Order 9066 had been
knowingly withheld from the Supreme Court. Specifically, he said [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Solicitor_General"] Solicitor General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_H._Fahy"] Charles H. Fahy had
kept from the Court a wartime finding by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Naval_Intelligence"] Office of Naval Intelligence, the Ringle Report, that
concluded very few Japanese represented a risk and that almost all of those who did were already in
custody when the Executive Order was enacted.[21] While not admitting error, the government submitted a
counter-motion asking the court to vacate the conviction without a finding of fact on its merits. Judge
Page 8
 Marilyn Hall Patel denied the government's petition, and concluded that the Supreme Court had indeed
been given a selective record, representing a compelling circumstance sufficient to overturn the original
conviction. She granted the writ, thereby voiding Korematsu's conviction, while pointing out that since this
decision was based on prosecutorial misconduct and not an error of law, any legal precedent established by
the case remained in force.[22][23]
2011 DOJ admission of error
On May 20, 2011, Acting Solicitor General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Katyal"] Neal Katyal released an unusual statement denouncing one of
his predecessors, Solicitor General Charles H. Fahy.[21] He faulted Fahy for having "suppressed critical
evidence" in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirabayashi_v._United_States"] Hirabayashi and Korematsu cases before the Supreme Court during World War II,
specifically the Ringle Report's conclusion that there was no indication Japanese Americans were acting as
spies or sending signals to enemy submarines. The rulings in the 1980s that overturned the convictions of
Korematsu and Hirabayashi concluded that failure to disclose the Ringle Report, along with an initial report
by General De Witt that demonstrated racist motivations behind the military orders, represented a fatal flaw
in the prosecution of their cases before the Supreme Court. Katyal noted that Justice Department attorneys
had actually alerted Fahy that failing to disclose the Ringle Report's existence in the briefs or argument in
the Supreme Court "might approximate the suppression of evidence". Thus, Katyal concluded that Fahy
"did not inform the Court that a key set of allegations used to justify the internment" had been doubted, if
not fully discredited, within the government's own agencies.
Katyal therefore announced his office's filing of a formal "admission of error".  He reaffirmed the
extraordinary duty of the Solicitor General to address the Court with "absolute candor," due to the "special
credence" the Court explicitly grants to his court submissions.[24]
21st century reactions
Eleven lawyers who had represented Fred Korematsu, Gordon Hirabayashi, and
 Minoru Yasui in successful efforts in lower federal courts to nullify their convictions
for violating military curfew and exclusion orders sent a letter dated January 13,
2014,[25] to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Solicitor_General"] Solicitor General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Verrilli_Jr."] Donald Verrilli Jr. In light of the appeal proceedings
before the U.S. Supreme Court in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedges_v._Obama"] Hedges v. Obama, the lawyers asked Verrilli to ask
the Supreme Court to overrule its decisions in Korematsu, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirabayashi_v._United_States"] Hirabayashi (1943) and
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasui_v._United_States"] Yasui (1943). If the Solicitor General shouldn't do this, they asked that the United
States government to "make clear" that the federal government "does not consider the
internment decisions as valid precedent for governmental or military detention of
individuals or groups without due process of law [...]."[26] 
 Fred Korematsu
 On February 3, 2014, Justice Antonin Scalia, during a discussion with law students at the University of
Hawaii at Manoa [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_S._Richardson_School_of_Law"] William S. Richardson School of Law, said that "the Supreme Court's Korematsu
decision upholding the internment of Japanese Americans was wrong, but it could happen again in war
time."[27] In October 2015 at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara_University"] Santa Clara University, Scalia told law students that Justice Jackson's
dissenting opinion in Korematsu was the past court opinion he admired most, adding "It was nice to know
that at least somebody on the court realized that that was wrong."[28]
 Donald Trump's Presidential election led [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_of_Kansas"] Kansas Secretary of State [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Kobach"] Kris Kobach to advocate for Trump to
implement immigration controls like the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Entry-Exit_Registration_System"] National Security Entry-Exit Registration System.[29][30] One
Trump supporter, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Higbie"] Carl Higbie, said that Jimmy Carter's 1980 restriction on Iranian immigration, as well as
the Korematsu decision, gives legal precedent for a registry of immigrants.[31] Critics of Higbie[32] argued
that Korematsu should not be referenced as precedent.[33][34][35] Constitutional lawyer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Fein"] Bruce Fein argued
Page 9
that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Liberties_Act_of_1988"] Civil Liberties Act of 1988 granting reparations to the Japanese Americans who were interned
amounts to Korematsu having been overturned by history[2]—outside of a potential formal Supreme Court
overrule.[36] Another critic of Higbie described Korematsu as a "stain on American jurisprudence".[3]

wrong at the very moment it was decided—and therefore should not be followed subsequently."[37] Justice
 Anthony Kennedy applied this approach in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_v._Texas"] Lawrence v. Texas to overturn [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowers_v._Hardwick"] Bowers v. Hardwick and thereby
strike down [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodomy_laws_in_the_United_States"] anti-sodomy laws in 14 states. The implication is that decisions which are wrong when decided
should not be followed even before the Court reverses itself, and Korematsu has probably the greatest claim
to being wrong when decided of any case which still stood.[37] Legal scholar [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Primus"] Richard Primus applied the
term "Anti-Canon" to cases which are "universally assailed as wrong, immoral, and unconstitutional"[36]
and have become exemplars of faulty legal reasoning.[1] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plessy_v._Ferguson"] Plessy v. Ferguson is one such example, and
Korematsu has joined this group—as Feldman then put it, "Korematsu's uniquely bad legal status means it's
not precedent even though it hasn't been overturned."[37]
Rejection in Trump v. Hawaii
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roberts"] Chief Justice Roberts, in writing the majority opinion of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States"] Supreme Court in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._Hawaii"] Trump v. Hawaii, stated that
Korematsu v. United States was wrongly decided, essentially disavowing the decision and indicating that a
majority of the court no longer finds Korematsu persuasive.[38]: 38  Quoting Justice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Jackson"] Robert H. Jackson's
dissent from Korematsu, the Chief Justice stated:
The dissent's reference to Korematsu, however, affords this Court the opportunity to make
express what is already obvious: Korematsu was gravely wrong the day it was decided, has
been overruled in the court of history, and—to be clear—'has no place in law under the
Constitution.'
— Trump v. Hawaii, slip op. at 38 (quoting 323 U.S., at 248 (Jackson, J.,
dissenting))[38]: 38 
Roberts also added: "The forcible relocation of U.S. citizens to concentration camps, solely and explicitly
on the basis of race, is objectively unlawful and outside the scope of Presidential authority."[38]: 38 [39][20]
Rejection in dissent of United States v. Zubaydah
 Justice Gorsuch, writing in his dissent of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Zubaydah"] United States v. Zubaydah, reiterated the fact that Korematsu was
negligent.[40] Gorsuch criticised the court for allowing "state interest" as a justification for "suppressing
judicial proceedings in the name of national security." He used Korematsu as a justification against doing
such.
Justice Gorsuch dissented stating:
In Korematsu v. United States,  the President persuaded this Court to permit the forced
internment of Japanese American citizens during World War II. The President did so in part by
relying on a military report that insisted immediate action was imperative to national security.
The report, however, contained information executive officials knew to be false at the
time....And still more years passed before this Court formally repudiated its decision. (Internal
citations omitted)
