Abditosaurus
Abditosaurus (meaning "forgotten lizard") is an extinct genus of
 titanosaurian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropod"] sauropod dinosaur from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Cretaceous"] Late Cretaceous
(Maastrichtian) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremp_Formation"] Tremp Group of Catalonia, Spain. The type and
only species is Abditosaurus kuehnei. Phylogenetic analyses
recover it within a clade of South American and African
saltasaurines, distinct from other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insular_dwarfism"] insular dwarf sauropods from
the European archipelago. Abditosaurus inhabited the Ibero-
Armorican Island, a prehistoric island made up of what is now
Spain, Portugal, and southern France, and would have been the
largest titanosaur species in its environment.[1]

†A. kuehnei
While prospecting for fossil mammals in 1954, German 
 Binomial name
paleontologist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Georg_K%C3%BChne"] Walter Georg Kühne on 25 September discovered †Abditosaurus kuehnei
the remains of a large titanosaur at the Orcau-1 locality of the
 Conques Formation of Catalonia, Spain. It was the first major 
Vila et al., 2022
sauropod find in Spain. During the initial two weeks of excavation Kühne managed to identify around ten
bones, some of which were packaged and sent to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Instituto_Lucas_Mallada&action=edit&redlink=1"] Instituto Lucas Mallada (ILM) in Madrid, while
others remained at the site (jacketed for protection). Returning the following year, Kühne, alongside locals
and researchers of the ILM, managed to identify ten more bones in addition to most of those left at the site.
Like in 1954, some of the bones were transported to Madrid while the remainder were left at the site. These
initial discoveries consisted of fragments of the illium, parts of the scapula, dorsal vertebrae, chevrons, a
tibia, parts of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femurs"] femurs and a complete [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus"] humerus alongside undetermined bones. Although Kühne asked
for additional excavations, funding had run out and work at the locality was stopped. In 1956, the fossil
material recovered was assigned by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert-F%C3%A9lix_de_Lapparent"] Albert-Félix de Lapparent and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Aguirre"] Emiliano Aguirre to a new, but
unnamed, species of the now dubious genus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypselosaurus"] Hypselosaurus.[2] It was not until 1984 and 1986 that
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Institut_de_Paleontologia_de_Sabadell&action=edit&redlink=1"] additional expeditions to the area were conducted, helmed by Josep Vicenç Santafé of the Institut de
Paleontologia de Sabadell, Barcelona, and assisted by researchers of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institut_d%27Estudis_Ilerdencs"] Institut d’Estudis Ilerdencs, Lleida.
They identified a sternal plate and additional dorsal vertebrae. Another expedition was conducted from
 2012 to 2014 by the Institut Català de Paleontologia, the University of Zaragoza and the Museu de la
Conca Dellà. This expedition recovered elements left at the site by the 1955 and 1986 digs, with additional
Page 2
material of the limbs, tooth fragments, ribs and an articulated series of dorsal and cervical vertebrae.
Subsequent research managed to discover some of the historical material.[1] In 2017, part of the initial finds
were described.[3] This finding was shown in the 2017 documentary "Europe's Last Giant".
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_specimen"] type specimen, which has numerous accession numbers, is the most complete known European
titanosaur skeleton, with the semi-articulated neck, preserving twelve of the estimated fourteen cervical
vertebrae, being especially noteworthy.[4] Complete and nearly complete sequences of neck vertebrae are
very rare in sauropods; as of early 2022, only 27 sauropod specimens with complete or nearly complete
necks were known.[5]
Etymology
In 2022, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"] type species Abditosaurus kuehnei was named and described by Bernat Vila, Albert Sellés,
Miguel Moreno-Azanza, Novella L. Razzolini, Alejandro Gil-Delgado, José Ignacio Canudo and Àngel
Galobart. The generic name, Abditosaurus, means "forgotten reptile",[6] and is derived from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"] Latin
abditus, meaning "concealed," or "forgotten," as the fossil material was hidden for sixty years between the
initial discovery and the last expedition that collected the last bones, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"] Greek sauros,  meaning
"lizard". The specific name, kuehnei, honors Walter Georg Kühne, the discoverer of the type specimen.[1]
Description
Abditosaurus is noted for its large size, and is the largest titanosaur from the Ibero-Armorican Island, a
geological region composing most of Spain and Southern France.[6][4] It is estimated to have reached a
length of 17.5 metres (57 ft) and mass of 14 tonnes (15 short tons).[1]
The holotype includes an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossification"] ossified [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sternal_rib"] sternal rib and an ossified calcaneum, elements which hitherto had not
been unequivocally identified in titanosaur specimens, leading to speculation that they had fully
disappeared in the group. These bones probably ossified due to the advanced individual age of the
holotype, which was also proven by its bone structure.[1]

Phylogenetic position of Abditosaurus within Saltasauridae according to Vila et al.
2022.[1] European genera are highlighted in pink, showing that Abditosaurus is
not closely related to other European titanosaurs.
The discoverers of Abditosaurus interpreted it as a member of Saltasaurinae, a clade of titanosaurs found in
 South America and Africa. Their phylogenetic analysis recovered the Egyptian sauropod [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralititan"] Paralititan as the
sister taxon of Abditosaurus, with the Brazilian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxakalisaurus"] Maxakalisaurus as their next-closest relative. The clade
uniting these three species, in turn, formed a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_group"] sister clade to Saltasaurini. As such, Abditosaurus is not
closely related to other European sauropods, the majority of which were recovered as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opisthocoelicaudiinae"] opisthocoelicaudiines
by their phylogenetic analysis.[1]
Paleoecology
Page 4
The only known specimen of Abditosaurus was found in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conques_Formation"] Conques Formation, which dates to the early
 Maastrichtian age of the Cretaceous. At this time, southern France, Spain, and Portugal formed an island,
known as the Ibero-Armorican Island. Most titanosaur taxa of the Ibero-Armorican Island, such as
 Lirainosaurus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atsinganosaurus"] Atsinganosaurus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrigatitan"] Garrigatitan, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampelosaurus"] Ampelosaurus, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lohuecotitan"] Lohuecotitan, were small or medium-
sized. In contrast, Abditosaurus was significantly larger and lacked physiological adaptations to an island
environment, suggesting that the species was a recent arrival in the ecosystem. It may be part of a broader
trend of larger sauropods replacing smaller endemic species in Europe during the early Maastrichtian, as
larger sauropods first appear in the Hațeg biota around the same time. Abditosaurus is associated with eggs
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_fossil"] oospecies [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Fusioolithus_baghensis&action=edit&redlink=1"] Fusioolithus baghensis, which closely resemble eggs found in Gondwana.[1]
