Aachenosaurus
Aachenosaurus is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomen_dubium"] dubious [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"] genus of prehistoric [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant"] plant from
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Cretaceous"] Late Cretaceous (Santonian-Campanian).[1] It was named
based solely on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil"] fossilized fragments of material that were
originally thought to be jaw fragments from a duck-billed
 dinosaur (a hadrosaur). However, the fossils turned out to be
 petrified wood, to the great embarrassment of the discoverer.
The fossil's name means "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aachen"] Aachen lizard",  named for the
 Aachen Formation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moresnet"] Moresnet (which was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_territory"] neutral territory
between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium"] Belgium and Germany),  where the fossils were
found.[2]
A synonym of Aachenosaurus is Aachenoxylon, which was
coined by Dr [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maurice_Hovelacque&action=edit&redlink=1"] Maurice Hovelacque in 1889/1890.[3][4][5]

History
The holotype of Aachenosaurus was discovered in 1887[1] and
was named by the scientist (and abbé) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Smets"] Gerard Smets, on
October 31, 1888, who named the type species Aachenosaurus
multidens. Based on these fragments he determined that the
specimen was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrosaur"] hadrosaur reaching an estimated 4 to 5 meters
in length which might have had dermal spines.[2] He defended
this conclusion, citing that the fossils had been examined
visually with the naked eye, magnifying lenses and with the
microscope. However, his error was soon demonstrated by
 Louis Dollo. Smets at first tried to defend his original
identification but was again proven wrong by a neutral
commission. A rumor abounded that he completely withdrew
from science out of pure embarrassment, but not until he had
published a paper on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle"] turtles in 1889; this rumor was later
proven false.[6] The last paper he published was in 1895.
