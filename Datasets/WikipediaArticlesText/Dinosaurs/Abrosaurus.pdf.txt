Abrosaurus
Abrosaurus ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˌæbroʊˈsɔːrəs/; 'delicate lizard' from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek"] Greek
αβρος meaning 'delicate' or 'dainty' and σαυρος meaning
'lizard') is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"] genus of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macronaria"] macronarian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropod"] sauropod [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur"] dinosaur from the
 Middle Jurassic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(geology)"] Period of what is now Asia, one of many
 dinosaurs found at the Dashanpu Quarry in the Sichuan
Province of China.[1] Like most sauropods, Abrosaurus was a
 quadrupedal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivore"] herbivore but it was rather small for a sauropod, not
much more than 30 feet (9.1 m) long. Its head was boxy and
topped with a tall bony arch containing the nostrils.

Temporal range: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Jurassic"] Middle Jurassic
The generic name (meaning "delicate lizard") refers to the nature
of the skull, with large openings separated by thin bony struts.
The only named [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"] species is A. dongpoi, is named after eleventh-
century Chinese [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet"] poet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su_Shi"] Su Shi, also known as Su Dongpo, who
was born in Sichuan.

The naming of Abrosaurus has been a long and convoluted
process. Abrosaurus was discovered in 1984 and was first
Illustration of the head of Abrosaurus described in the 1986 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ph.D."] Ph.D. thesis of Chinese [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontologist"] paleontologist
 Ouyang Hui, with the specific name "A. gigantorhinus."[1]
However, the publication does not meet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Code_of_Zoological_Nomenclature"] ICZN standards so
"Abrosaurus gigantorhinus" is considered a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomen_nudum"] nomen nudum although it has been used incorrectly in at least
one paper.[2] Ouyang formally described this species in 1989 under the specific epithet A. dongpoensis.
However, in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature"] biological nomenclature, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"] Latin suffix -ensis is used only to honor localities and the name
has since been revised to include the more correct -i suffix, used to honor male individuals.[3] Abrosaurus
dongpoi is now the accepted name for this taxon.

The holotype, or original specimen, of Abrosaurus, ZDM 5038, is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil"] fossil skull which is nearly complete
and very well preserved. A fragmentary skull and a skeleton have also been referred to this taxon but
published description is lacking.[2] All of the material comes from the famous Dashanpu Quarry near
 Zigong in China, and is housed in the dinosaur museum there. Abrosaurus and at least 4 other species of
sauropod are known from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Shaximiao_Formation"] Lower Shaximiao Formation (also called Xiashaximiao) at Dashanpu. These
sediments are dated from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathonian"] Bathonian to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callovian"] Callovian stages of the Middle [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic"] Jurassic Period, or about 168 to
161 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_years_ago"] million years ago.
Classification
Abrosaurus was originally described as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarasaurid"] camarasaurid sauropod, and while it may not turn out to be a
member of that particular family, further research has indicated that it is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"] basal member of Macronaria,
much like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camarasaurus"] Camarasaurus itself. However, the remains of Abrosaurus have not been fully described,
making its exact placement in the sauropod family tree difficult to determine.[4]
