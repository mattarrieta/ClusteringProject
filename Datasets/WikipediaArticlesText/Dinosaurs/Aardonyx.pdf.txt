Aardonyx
Aardonyx ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afrikaans"] Afrikaans aard, "earth" + [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"] Greek onux, "nail, claw")
is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"] genus of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"] basal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropodomorpha"] sauropodomorph dinosaur. It is known from
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"] type species Aardonyx celestae found from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Jurassic"] Early Jurassic
 Elliot Formation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"] South Africa. A. celestae was named after
 Celeste Yates, who prepared much of the first known fossil
material of the species. It has arm features that are intermediate
between prosauropods and sauropods.[1] 
Aardonyx
Temporal range: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Jurassic"] Early Jurassic,
Based on the structure of the hind limbs and pelvic girdle of
Aardonyx,  the dinosaur normally moved bipedally but could
drop to quadrupedal movement similar to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iguanodon"] Iguanodon. It shares
some attributes with giant quadrupedal sauropods like
 Apatosaurus.[2] Australian[3][4] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontologist"] paleontologist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Adam_Yates_(paleontologist)&action=edit&redlink=1"] Adam Yates and
his team's discovery of the genus was published online before
print in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceedings_of_the_Royal_Society"] Proceedings of the Royal Society B in November 2009,
and was scheduled to appear in the March 2010 issue.[2] British
paleontologist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paul_Barrett_(paleontologist)&action=edit&redlink=1"] Paul Barrett of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_History_Museum,_London"] Natural History Museum,
London, who was not involved in the research, commented that
the discovery of Aardonyx "helps to fill a marked gap in our
knowledge of sauropod evolution, showing how a primarily
two-legged animal could start to acquire the specific features
necessary for a life spent on all-fours".[2]
According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Bonnan"] Matthew Bonnan, a co-author of the study, "We
already knew that the earliest sauropods and near-sauropods
would be bipeds. What Aardonyx shows us, however, is that
walking quadrupedally and bearing weight on the inside of the
foot is a trend that started very early in these dinosaurs, much
earlier than previously hypothesized." Bonnan adds, "On a
scientific level, it's really fulfilling to have a hypothesis on how
you think dinosaurs got large, then to test that in the field and get
back these kind of data — a new dinosaur — that really does
start to fill in some of those anatomical gaps."

Description 
The genus is known from disarticulated bones belonging to two
immature individuals. The material consists of cranial elements,
vertebrae, dorsal and cervical ribs, gastralia, chevrons, elements of
Aardonyx compared to a human in
size 
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectoral_girdle"] pectoral and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelvic_girdle"] pelvic girdles, and bones of the fore and hind
limbs, manus, and pes. The presence of these bones in a single
dense accumulation in a localized channel fill suggests that they
came from relatively complete carcasses.[5] Both individuals are
thought to have been less than 10 years old at the time of their
death because of the lack of peripheral rest lines in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_bone"] cortices of sampled bones. Additional evidence for
immaturity at the time of death includes calcified cartilage at the articular end of the scapula.[1]
Classification
Aardonyx is thought to be
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_taxon"] sister taxon of a
sauropodomorph clade
containing
 Melanorosaurus and
sauropods, which are all
obligatory quadrupeds,
based on a phylogenetic
analysis conducted along
with the first description of
the genus. Many features
of the skeleton support this
relationship. These include
derived traits seen in the
vertebrae (such as
hyposphenes that are as
deep as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_canal"] neural canal
 and mid-cervical neural
spines that are less than
twice as long as high) as
well as the appendicular
skeleton (such as the
 position of the fourth
trochanter over the
midlength of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femur"] femur and
an adult femur length
exceeding 600 mm).[1]

The jaws of Aardonyx are
narrow and V-shaped with

characteristic shared with 
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladogram"] Cladogram showing the position of Aardonyx within Sauropodomorpha
after Yates et al., 2010.[1]
other  basal
sauropodomorphs. In sauropods, the jaws are broad and U-shaped to allow for a wider bite. The absence of
a lateral ridge at the caudal end of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentary"] dentary is indicative of a loss of fleshy cheeks. This is seen as an
adaptation for a wider gape to facilitate in bulk browsing, and is observed in nearly all sauropods. The
lateral neurovascular foramina of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"] maxilla of Aardonyx are smaller than those of other basal
sauropodomorphs, and indicate that there was a reduction in blood supply to the buccal tissues and thus a
loss of fleshy cheeks. The development of lateral plates along the alveolar margins of some bones of the
skull would have helped brace the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_used_terms_of_relationship_and_comparison_in_dentistry"] lingual sides of the teeth against bucco-lingual forces during foliage
stripping.
The presence of plesiomorphic V-shaped jaws along with the absence of fleshy cheeks is an unusual
characteristic of Aardonyx. Previously, it was thought that broader jaws evolved prior to the reduction and
loss in fleshy cheeks as an adaptation toward bulk-browsing in sauropods. The sauropod
 Chinshakiangosaurus possessed jaws that were U-shaped, while still retaining fleshy cheeks, the opposite
of the condition seen in Aardonyx.[6] Because Chinshakiangosaurus is a more derived sauropodomorph,
this suggests that a wide, cheekless gape may have evolved twice in Sauropodomorpha: once with
Aardonyx and again with sauropods more advanced than Chinshakiangosaurus.[1]
Locomotion
Characteristics of the limbs of Aardonyx suggest that it was
habitually bipedal. Evidence for bipedalism can be seen in the
forelimbs; the structure of the radius and ulna limited the degree to
which the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_(zoology)"] manus could be pronated, and the length of the humerus
is only 72 percent that of the femur. However, characteristics found
in both the fore and hind limbs of Aardonyx show a trend toward Restoration
more habitual quadrupedalism that would eventually lead to the
obligatory quadrupedalism seen in sauropods. The proximal end of
the ulna possesses an incipient craniolateral process that gives the bone a y-shape similar to, although more
subtle than, those of obligatory quadrupedal sauropodomorphs. The radius is shifted cranially, and a radial
fossa allows for the ulna to cradle the radius craniolaterally. These characteristics suggest that there was a
development towards greater quadrupedalism in Aardonyx. Although the hindlimbs of Aardonyx clearly
show evidence for bipedalism (such as the retention of a convex proximal lateral profile of the femur and
the position of the cranial trochanter far from the lateral margin of the femur), there is also evidence that
indicates a shift toward quadrupedalism. Features of the femur suggests that the gait of Aardonyx was
slower than that of more basal sauropodomorphs. The shaft of the femur is straighter and the fourth
trochanter is more distally placed. The repositioning of the fourth trochanter to a more distal position causes
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caudofemoralis"] M. caudofemoralis longus muscle, the main femoral retractor muscle, to have greater leverage (more
mechanical advantage) but conversely a decrease in the velocity of femoral retraction; consequently,
Aardonyx was a powerful but slower walker than typical prosauropods.
Page 4
Another characteristic that suggests a slower gait in Aardonyx is the robustness of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatarsal"] metatarsal I in
comparison with those of other basal sauropodomorphs. This is evidence of a more medial, or entaxonic,
position of the weight bearing axis of the foot, as opposed to a more [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mesaxonic&action=edit&redlink=1"] mesaxonic position where the weight
bearing axis runs through digit III. The development of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Entaxony&action=edit&redlink=1"] entaxony in Aardonyx provides further evidence for
its reduced cursorial ability and wider gauge-gait, which is thought to have preceded obligatory
quadrupedalism in sauropodomorphs. Previously, it was thought that entaxony developed after the
divergence of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcanodon"] Vulcanodon due to the presence of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mesaxony&action=edit&redlink=1"] mesaxony in the genus.[7] However, the presence of
mesaxony in Vulcanodon can be now considered an evolutionary reversal given the clear presence of
entaxony in Aardonyx.[1]
