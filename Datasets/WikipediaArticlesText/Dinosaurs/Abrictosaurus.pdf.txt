Abrictosaurus
Abrictosaurus ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /əˌbrɪktəˈsɔːrəs/; "wakeful lizard") is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"] genus
 of heterodontosaurid dinosaur that lived during the Early
Jurassic in what is now in parts of southern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"] Africa such as
 Lesotho and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"] South Africa. It was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipedal"] bipedal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivore"] herbivore or
 omnivore and was one of the most basal heterodontosaurids. It
was approximately 1.2 metres (3.9 ft) long and weighed
between 0.68 and 3 kilograms (1.5 and 6.6 lb).[1] 
Abrictosaurus
Temporal range: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Jurassic"] Early Jurassic,
This dinosaur is known from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil"] fossil remains of only two
 individuals, found in the Upper Elliot Formation of Qacha's
Nek District in Lesotho and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Province"] Cape Province in South Africa.
The Upper Elliot is thought to date from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hettangian"] Hettangian and
 Sinemurian stages of the Early Jurassic Period, approximately
200 to 190 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_years_ago"] million years ago.[2] This formation is thought to
preserve [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_dune"] sand dunes as well as seasonal floodplains, in a
 semiarid environment with sporadic rainfall. Other dinosaurs
found in this [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_formation"] formation include the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theropod"] theropod [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megapnosaurus"] Megapnosaurus,

heterodontosaurids like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodontosaurus"] Heterodontosaurus and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycorhinus"] Lycorhinus.
Remains of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_animal"] terrestrial crocodylomorphs, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynodont"] cynodonts and early

Illustration of the Abrictosaurus 
 Heterodontosaurids like Abrictosaurus were small, early
ornithischians, named for their markedly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterodont"] heterodont dentition. They
are best known for the large, canine-like tusks (often called
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caniniform"] caniniforms) in both upper and lower jaws. There were no teeth in
the front of the jaws, where a hard [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhamphotheca"] beak was used to crop
vegetation. There were three [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premaxilla"] premaxillary teeth, with the first two
small and conical and the third enlarged to form the upper
caniniform, counterpart to the even larger lower caniniform, which
was the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentary"] dentary tooth. In the upper jaw, a large gap (or
Page 2
diastema) accommodated the lower caniniform tooth and separated the premaxillary teeth from the wider
chewing teeth of the maxilla. Similar teeth lined the remainder of the lower jaw.[3]
Abrictosaurus is usually considered the most [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"] basal member of the family Heterodontosauridae.[2][3]
Lycorhinus and Heterodontosaurus both had [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypsodont"] high-crowned cheek teeth, which overlapped each other in
the jaw, forming a continuous chewing surface [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy_(biology)"] analogous to those of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous"] Cretaceous hadrosaurids.
Abrictosaurus had more widely separated cheek teeth, with lower crowns, more similar to other early
ornithischians. It has been suggested that Abrictosaurus lacked tusks and that this is another primitive
feature.[4] However, caniniforms were clearly present on one of the two specimens of Abrictosaurus. The
upper caniniform measured 10.5 millimeters (0.4 inches) high, while the lower reached 17 mm (0.67 in).
These caniniforms were serrated only on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior"] anterior surface, unlike those of Lycorhinus and
Heterodontosaurus, which were serrated on both anterior and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_(anatomy)"] posterior edges.[5][6] Abrictosaurus also had
smaller, less powerful forelimbs than Heterodontosaurus and one fewer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phalanx_bones"] phalanx bone in both the fourth
and fifth digits of the forelimb.[7]
History and naming
Both specimens of Abrictosaurus are housed in the collection of
 University College London. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holotype"] holotype specimen was
discovered in Lesotho and consists of a partial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull"] skull and skeleton
(UCL B54). [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontologist"] Paleontologist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Thulborn"] Richard Thulborn, who first described
the specimen in 1974, considered it a new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species"] species of Lycorhinus
and named it L. consors, using the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"] Latin word consors which
means 'companion' or 'spouse'.  As UCL B54 lacked the
caniniforms which had been found in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"] type species, Lycorhinus
angustidens, Thulborn believed it to be female.[7] Neither the skull Skull diagram
nor the skeletons of Abrictosaurus have been fully described in the
literature. A tooth from the latest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triassic"] Triassic of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"] Switzerland has been assigned to Abrictosaurus sp., but this
has not been supported, as the specimen does not have unique characteristics of Abrictosaurus,
heterodontosaurids, or ornithischians in general.[8]
Forelimb and diagram 
In 1975, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hopson"] James Hopson redescribed a fragmentary heterodontosaur
skull (UCL A100) found in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"] South Africa that Thulborn had
previously assigned to Lycorhinus angustidens.[5] After showing
that UCL A100 could not belong to L. angustidens but was instead
more similar to UCL B54, Hopson erected a new genus to contain
both specimens. The generic name Abrictosaurus (from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek"] Greek
αβρικτος (abriktos)  meaning 'wakeful' and σαυρος (sauros)
meaning 'lizard') refers to Hopson's disagreement with Thulborn's
 hypothesis that heterodontosaurids underwent periods of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aestivation"] aestivation
([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernation"] hibernation during hot and/or dry seasons). The specific name was
retained, creating the new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_nomenclature"] binomial Abrictosaurus consors.[6]
Despite Hopson's renaming, Thulborn continued to consider
Lycorhinus angustidens,  Heterodontosaurus tucki,  and
Abrictosaurus consors to be three species of the genus Lycorhinus.
Most paleontologists maintain all three genera separately, although
there is no precise definition of a species or genus in
paleontology.[2]
Sexual dimorphism
Page 3
The hypothesis of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism"] sexual dimorphism in heterodontosaurids has long centered on Abrictosaurus. Tusks are
a sexually dimorphic trait in many modern mammals, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musk_deer"] musk deer, walrus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant"] Asian elephants and
many pigs, with tusks being present primarily in males. The lack of tusks in UCL B54 led to suggestions
that it was female; perhaps even a female of another species.[7] The discovery of caniniforms in UCL A100
showed that A. consors also has this 'male' characteristic, suggesting that it is at least a valid species in its
own right. However, UCL B54 may actually be a juvenile, based on its short face and unfused [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum"] sacral (hip)
vertebrae. Therefore, the lack of tusks could be a juvenile trait instead of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sexual_characteristic"] secondary sexual characteristic,
weakening the case for sexual dimorphism.[3]
