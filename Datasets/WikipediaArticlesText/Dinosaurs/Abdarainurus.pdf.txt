Abdarainurus
Abdarainurus (meaning "Abdrant Nuru tail" after the holotype
 locality) is a genus of titanosaur dinosaur from the Alagteeg
Formation in Mongolia. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"] type and only species is A.
barsboldi. Currently seen as an indeterminate titanosaur, it may
represent a  previously unknown lineage of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"] Asian
macronarians.[1] Abdarainurus is not known from many
remains; it is only known from eight front tail vertebrae and a
middle tail vertebra and several chevrons.

Discovery and naming 
Averianov & Lopatin,
 2020
 The holotype, PIN 5669/1, was discovered in 1970 in Abdrant 
 Type species
Nuru, hence the genus name, during a Joint Soviet–Mongolian †Abdarainurus barsboldi
Paleontological expedition and was excavated by V. P.
Tverdokhlebov of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratov_State_University"] Saratov State University. The fossils were left 
Averianov & Lopatin, 2020
unprepared until at least 2000, when paleontologist Andrei Podlesnow revealed that they probably
belonged to a new genus of sauropod.[2] The species Abdarainurus barsboldi was named in February
2020.[1]
Paleoecology
Abdarainurus was discovered in the Abdarant Nuru locality of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alagteeg_Formation"] Alagteeg Formation (which may be the
same unit as the overlying [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djadochta_Formation"] Djadochta Formation)[3] of Mongolia[1] and coexisted with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankylosaur"] ankylosaur
 Pinacosaurus sp., and indeterminate turtles and dinosaurs.
Classification
Abdarainurus was added to the phylogenetic analysis of Mannion and colleagues by Averianov and
Lopatin, who ran the matrix under three different conditions. With all characters treated as equally
important, Abdarainurus resolved as a non-titanosaur member of Somphospondyli, in a large polytomy
with a variety of taxa. The more labile characters treated as slightly, or significantly, less important,
Page 2
Abdarainurus was either a basal titanosaur in a clade with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andesaurus"] Andesaurus and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huabeisaurus"] Huabeisaurus or as a member
of Aeolosaurinae, respectively. As Abdarainurus was resolved with the fewest unique features as a basal
titanosaur, Averianov and Lopatin suggested that phylogenetic result was the most likely, shown below.[1]
