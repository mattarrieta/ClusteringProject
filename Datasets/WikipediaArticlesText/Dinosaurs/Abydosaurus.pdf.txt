Discovery and description
Abydosaurus is one of the few sauropods known from skull
material, with the first described complete skull for a Cretaceous
sauropod from the Americas.[1] It is also notable for its narrow
teeth, as earlier brachiosaurids had broader teeth.[1]
Abydosaurus is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holotype"] based on DINO 16488, a nearly complete skull
and lower jaws with the first four neck vertebrae. Abundant
skull and postcranial bones were found at the same site,
including partial skulls from three additional individuals, a partial
 hip and associated tail vertebrae, a shoulder blade, an upper arm
bone, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacarpus"] hand bones. These fossils were found in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandstone"] sandstone
 bed at the base of the Mussentuchit Member of the Cedar
 Mountain Formation, near the old visitor center of Dinosaur
National Monument. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zircon"] Zircons from mudstones beneath the bone-
bearing sandstone indicate the age of the sandstone and its
contained bones is less than 104.46 ± 0.95 million years, in the
 Albian stage of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Cretaceous"] Early Cretaceous.[1]

Although Abydosaurus lived some 40 million years after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffatitan"] Giraffatitan, the skulls of these two genera are
similar except for the narrower, sharper teeth and smaller nose of Abydosaurus. Abydosaurus can be
differentiated from all other sauropods, including Giraffatitan, by subtle features of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_bone"] nasal and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"] maxillary
bones, its relatively small external nares (nostrils), and some features of the teeth.[1] In 2012 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_R._Holtz_Jr."] Thomas Hotlz
gave a length of 18.3 metres (60 ft).[2]

Abydosaurus was named in 2010 by Daniel Chure and colleagues. The genus name is a reference to
 Egyptian mythology: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abydos,_Egypt"] Abydos is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek"] Greek name for a city on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile"] Nile where the head and neck of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris"] Osiris
were buried, while the holotype of Abydosaurus consists of a head and neck found in rocks overlooking
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_River_(Colorado_River)"] Green River. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"] type species is A. mcintoshi in honor of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_S._McIntosh&action=edit&redlink=1"] John S. ("Jack") McIntosh,[1] Professor of
Physics, Emeritus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesleyan_University"] Wesleyan University, and his contributions to Dinosaur National Monument and the
study of sauropod dinosaurs.[1][3][4]
