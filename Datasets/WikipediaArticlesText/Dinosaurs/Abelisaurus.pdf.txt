Abelisaurus
Abelisaurus ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /əˌbɛlɪˈsɔːrəs/;  "Abel's lizard") is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus"] genus of
predatory [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelisaurid"] abelisaurid [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theropod"] theropod [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur"] dinosaur alive during the Late
 Cretaceous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(geology)"] Period (Campanian) of what is now [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"] South America.
It was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biped"] bipedal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore"] carnivore that probably reached about 7.4
metres (24 ft 3 in) in length, although this is uncertain as it is
known from only one partial skull.

Coining the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_species"] type species Abelisaurus comahuensis, both genus  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym_(taxonomy)"] Synonyms
and species were named and described by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Argentines"] Argentine
 paleontologists [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Bonaparte"] José Bonaparte and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Emilio_Novas"] Fernando Emilio Novas in  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aucasaurus"] Aucasaurus garridoi? Coria et
1985. The generic name recognizes Roberto Abel as the
discoverer of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_specimen"] type specimen, and also as the former director 
al., 2002
of the provincial Museum of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipolletti"] Cipolletti in Argentina, where the
specimen is housed. It also incorporates the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek"] Greek σαυρος (sauros), meaning 'lizard'. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_name_(zoology)"] specific name
comahuensis honors the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comahue"] Comahue region of Argentina, where the fossil was found.[1]

The holotype, MC 11078, was in 1983 uncovered at the "Cantera de la Pala Mécanica"-site in the Lago
Pellegrini quarries exploited by Abel since 1975. This single known [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil"] fossil of Abelisaurus consists of a
skull, lacking the lower jaws, that is incomplete, especially on the right side. Most of the connections
between the snout and the back of the skull are absent. It is also missing most of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palate"] palate (roof of the
mouth). Despite the missing pieces, it could be estimated at over 85 centimetres (33 in) long.[1]
Abelisaurus is one of the many dinosaurs that have been discovered in Patagonia. It was originally
described as coming from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Formation"] Allen Formation but subsequent research proved the remains were actually
found in the older [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anacleto_Formation"] Anacleto Formation (part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuquen_group"] Neuquén Group) of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Negro_Province"] Rio Negro Province, Argentina.
However, locally Abelisaurus is known to have come from the Sr. Fernandez field, which is in the
 Coniacian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Formation"] Allen Formation.[2] Clearly, more study is required. The Anacleto is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geologic_formation"] geologic formation in
South America, dating from the early [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campanian"] Campanian stage of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Cretaceous"] Late Cretaceous Period, between 83 and 80
 million years ago.[3]
In 2009, Novas suggested that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aucasaurus"] Aucasaurus garridoi might be a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_synonym"] junior synonym of Abelisaurus
comahuensis.[4] In 2010, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_S._Paul"] Gregory S. Paul renamed Aucasaurus garridoi into Abelisaurus garridoi.[5] This
has found no acceptance.
Description 
As only the skull is known,
it has proven difficult to
provide a  reliable size
Size comparison of Abelisaurus (red)
with other carnotaurins 
estimate of Abelisaurus. It
has transpired that
abelisaurids have relatively
short heads. In 2010,
 Gregory S. Paul estimated its body length at ten metres (32 ft
10 in), its weight at 3 tonnes (3 long tons; 3 short tons).[5] In 2012
 Thomas Holtz gave a possible length of 11 metres (36.3 feet).[6] In
2016, its length was estimated to be 7.4 metres (24 ft 3 in) in a
comprehensive analysis of abelisaur size.[7] Others authors gave a
similar size at 7.2 metres (23.6 feet) and 1.65 tonnes (1.82 short
tons).[8] 
Artist's restoration
Skull length was estimated at 85 centimetres (331⁄2 in) in 1985. The skull is relatively deep. Although there
are no bony crests or horns, like those found in some other abelisaurids, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnotaurus"] Carnotaurus, rough ridges
on the snout and above the eyes might have supported some kind of crest made out of keratin, which would
not have become fossilized. The skull roof is thickened. There are also very large fenestrae (window-like
openings) in the skull, which are found in many dinosaurs and reduce skull weight. One of these is a large
triangular [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antorbital_fenestra"] antorbital fenestra in the side of the snout. The eye socket behind it is rather high. It is constricted
in the middle by bony projections of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimal_bone"] lacrimal bone in the front and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postorbital_bone"] postorbital bone at the rear. The
eye was located above the constriction. Behind the eye socket a large triangular [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infratemporal_fenestra"] infratemporal fenestra is
present. Its form reflects a strong forward inclination of the back of the skull.[1]
The front snout bone, the praemaxilla, bore four relatively small teeth. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxilla"] maxilla behind it had at least
seven, but perhaps as many as thirteen, larger teeth.[1]

Bonaparte and Novas placed Abelisaurus in the newly created [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)"] family [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelisauridae"] Abelisauridae in 1985. They thought
it was a member of the Carnosauria.[1] Abelisaurus was the first abelisaurid named.[4]
Many other abelisaurids have since been discovered, including much more complete specimens of
 Aucasaurus, Carnotaurus and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majungasaurus"] Majungasaurus. They showed that abelisaurids were not carnosaurs in the
modern sense, but belonged to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoceratosauria"] Neoceratosauria instead. Some scientists place Abelisaurus as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_(phylogenetics)"] basal
abelisaurid, outside the subfamily Carnotaurinae.[9][10] Others are less certain of its position.[11][12]
Abelisaurus shares some skull features, such as a relative elongation, with the carcharodontosaurids, a
group unrelated to other species assigned to the Abelisauridae, and, since it is known only from a skull, it
has been suggested that future discoveries may show that Abelisaurus was in fact a
carcharodontosaurid.[13] However, this is thought unlikely.[12]
Paleobiology
As the skull of Abelisaurus was relatively broad at the back,
Bonaparte and Novas drew a comparison between the newly
described species and the also wide-skulled Tyrannosauridae. They
 assumed that, just as tyrannosaurids, Abelisaurus were the apex
predators of their ecosystem.[1]
In 2010, Paul proposed that Abelisaurus hunted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanosauria"] titanosaurian
sauropods, such as  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctosaurus"] Antarctosaurus,  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pellegrinisaurus"] Pellegrinisaurus,
 Barrosasaurus and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuquensaurus"] Neuquensaurus.[5]
