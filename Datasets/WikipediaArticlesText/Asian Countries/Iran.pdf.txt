Iran (Persian: ‎ایران Irân [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Persian"] [ʔiːˈɾɒːn] (  listen)),  also called
Persia,[11] and officially the Islamic Republic of Iran,[a] is a
country in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Asia"] Western Asia. It is bordered by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq"] Iraq and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"] Turkey to the
 west, by Azerbaijan and Armenia to the northwest, by the Caspian
Sea and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmenistan"] Turkmenistan to the north, by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan"] Afghanistan and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"] Pakistan to
the east, and by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Oman"] Gulf of Oman and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf"] Persian Gulf to the south.
It covers an area of 1,648,195 km2 (636,372 sq mi), making it the
 fourth-largest country entirely in Asia and the second-largest
country in Western Asia behind [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia"] Saudi Arabia. Iran has a population
of 85 million, making it the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population"] 17th-most populous country in the
world.[12] Its capital and largest city is Tehran, followed by
Mashhad, Isfahan, Karaj, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiraz"] Shiraz and Tabriz.
The country is home to one of the world's  oldest
civilizations,[13][14] beginning with the formation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elam"] Elamite
kingdoms in the fourth millennium BC. It was first unified by the
Medes, an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ancient_Iranian_peoples"] ancient Iranian people, in the seventh century BC,[15]
and reached its territorial height in the sixth century BC, when
 Cyrus the Great founded the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire"] Achaemenid Persian Empire, which
became [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_empires"] one of the largest empires in history and has been described
as the world's first effective superpower.[16] The Achaemenid
Empire fell to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great"] Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC and
was subsequently divided into several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period"] Hellenistic states. An Iranian
rebellion established the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire"] Parthian Empire in the third century BC,
 which was succeeded in the third century AD by the Sassanid
Empire, a major world power for the next four centuries.[17][18]
 Arab Muslims conquered the empire in the seventh century AD,
which led to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamization_of_Iran"] Islamization of Iran. It subsequently became a
major center of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_culture"] Islamic culture and learning, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_art"] its art, literature,
philosophy, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_architecture"] architecture spreading across the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world"] Muslim world and
beyond during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age"] Islamic Golden Age. Over the next two
centuries, a series of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Intermezzo"] native Iranian Muslim dynasties emerged
before the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuk_dynasty"] Seljuk Turks and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilkhanate"] Mongols conquered the region. In
the 15th century, the native [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_dynasty"] Safavids re-established a unified Iranian
 state and national identity,[4] and converted the country to Shia
Islam.[5][19] Under the reign of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nader_Shah"] Nader Shah in the 18th century, Iran
once again became a major world power,[20] though by the 19th
century, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Persian_Wars"] series of conflicts with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire"] Russian Empire led to
significant territorial losses.[21][22] The early 20th century saw the
 Persian Constitutional Revolution. Efforts to nationalize its fossil
 fuel supply from Western companies led to an Anglo-American
coup in 1953, which resulted in greater autocratic rule under
 Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and growing Western political
influence.[23] He went on to launch [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Revolution"] a far-reaching series of reforms
 in 1963.[24] After the Iranian Revolution, the current Islamic
Republic was established in 1979[25] by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhollah_Khomeini"] Ruhollah Khomeini, who
became the country's first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran"] Supreme Leader.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran"] government of Iran is an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_theocracy"] Islamic theocracy that includes
elements of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_system"] presidential democracy, with the ultimate authority
 vested in an autocratic "Supreme Leader";[26] a position held by Ali

is widely considered to be authoritarian, and has attracted
widespread criticism for its significant constraints and abuses against
 human rights and civil liberties,[27][28][29][30] including several

supply and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_proven_oil_reserves"] fourth-largest proven oil reserves.[32] The country's
 rich cultural legacy is reflected in part by its 26 UNESCO World
Heritage Sites.[33] Historically a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_state"] multinational state, Iran remains a
 pluralistic society comprising numerous ethnic, linguistic, and
religious groups, with the largest of these being Persians, Azeris,
Kurds, Mazandaranis, and Lurs.[3]

Name
The term [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_(word)"] Iran derives directly from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Persian"] Middle Persian Ērān, first attested in a
third-century inscription at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naqsh-e_Rostam"] Naqsh-e Rostam, with the accompanying [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_language"] Parthian
 inscription using the term Aryān, in reference to the Iranians.[36] The Middle
Iranian ērān and aryān are oblique plural forms of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonym"] gentilic nouns ēr- (Middle
Persian) and ary- (Parthian), both deriving from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Iranian_language"] Proto-Iranian language *arya-
(meaning "Aryan", i.e. "of the Iranians"),[36][37] recognized as a derivative of
 Proto-Indo-European language *ar-yo-,  meaning "one who assembles
(skilfully)".[38] In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_languages"] Iranian languages, the gentilic is attested as a self-
identifier, included in ancient inscriptions and the literature of the Avesta,[39][b]
and remains also in other Iranian ethnic names [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alans"] Alan (Ossetian: Ир Ir) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_people"] Iron
(Ирон).[37] According to the Iranian mythology, the country's name comes
from the name of Iraj, a legendary prince and shah who was killed by his
brothers.[40]Historically, Iran has been referred to as Persia by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"] the West,[11]
due mainly to the writings of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks"] Greek historians who referred to all of Iran as 
Inscription of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardashir_I"] Ardeshir Babakan (r. 224–
242) in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda_and_Ardashir_I"] Naqsh-e Rostam: "This is the
figure of Mazdaworshiper, the lord
Ardashir, Shahanshah of Iran..."[34]
Persís ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek"] Ancient Greek: Περσίς; from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Persian"] Old Persian  Pârsa),[41]
meaning "land of the Persians", while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persis"] Persis itself was one of the provinces of ancient Iran that is today known as Fars.[42]
As the most extensive interaction the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece"] ancient Greeks had with any outsider was with the Persians, the term persisted, even
long after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars"] Greco-Persian Wars (499–449 BC).

In 1935, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reza_Shah"] Reza Shah requested the international community to refer to the
country by its native name, Iran, on Nowruz, falling on 21 March 1935;
effective 22 March that year.[43][44] Opposition to the name change led to the
reversal of the decision in 1959, and Professor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehsan_Yarshater"] Ehsan Yarshater, editor of
 Encyclopædia Iranica,  propagated a move to use Persia and Iran
interchangeably.[45] Today, both Iran and Persia are used in cultural contexts,
while Iran remains irreplaceable in official state contexts.[46]
Historical and cultural usage of the word Iran is not restricted to the modern
state proper.[47][48][49] "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Iran"] Greater Iran" (Irānzamīn or Irān e Bozorg)[50] refers to
territories of the Iranian cultural and linguistic zones. In addition to modern
Iran, it includes portions of the Caucasus, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, Afghanistan,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"] Central Asia.[51] 
An [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashrafi"] Ashrafi Coin of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nader_Shah"] Nader Shah (r. 1736–
1747), reverse:"Coined on gold the word of
 kingdom in the world, Nader of Greater
Iran and the world-conquerer king."[35]
Pronunciation
The Persian pronunciation of Iran is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Persian"] [ʔiːˈɾɒːn]. Common [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_in_the_Commonwealth_of_Nations"] Commonwealth English pronunciations of Iran are listed in the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary"] Oxford English Dictionary as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ɪˈrɑːn/ and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ɪˈræn/,[52] while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English"] American English dictionaries such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam-Webster"] Merriam-Webster's
 provide pronunciations which map to /ɪˈrɑːn, -ˈræn, aɪˈræn/,[53] or likewise in Random House Webster's Unabridged
Dictionary as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ɪˈræn, ɪˈrɑːn, aɪˈræn/. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_Advanced_Learner%27s_Dictionary"] Cambridge Dictionary lists [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ɪˈrɑːn/ as the British pronunciation and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ɪˈræn/ as the
American pronunciation. Similarly, Glasgow-based [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_English_Dictionary"] Collins English Dictionary provides both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_in_England"] English English and
American English pronunciations. The pronunciation guide from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America"] Voice of America also provides [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ɪˈrɑːn/.[54]
The American English pronunciation [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /aɪˈræn/ may be heard in U.S. media. Max Fisher in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post"] The Washington Post[55]
prescribed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /iːˈrɑːn/ for Iran, while proscribing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /aɪˈræn/. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Heritage_Dictionary_of_the_English_Language"] The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, in the
dictionary's 2014 Usage Ballot, addressed the topic of the pronunciations of Iran and Iraq.[56] According to this survey, the
pronunciations [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ɪˈrɑːn/ and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ɪˈræn/ were deemed almost equally acceptable, while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ɪˈrɑːn/ was preferred by most panelists
participating in the ballot. With regard to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /aɪˈræn/ pronunciation, more than 70% of the panelists deemed it unacceptable.
Among the reasons given by those panelists were that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /aɪˈræn/ has "hawkish connotations" and sounds "angrier",
"xenophobic", "ignorant", and "not ... cosmopolitan". The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /aɪˈræn/ pronunciation remains standard and acceptable, reflected
in the entry for Iran in the American Heritage Dictionary itself, as well as in each of the other major dictionaries of
American English.
History
Prehistory
The earliest attested archaeological artifacts in Iran, like those excavated at
 Kashafrud and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganj_Par"] Ganj Par in northern Iran, confirm a human presence in Iran since
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Paleolithic"] Lower Paleolithic.[58] Iran's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal"] Neanderthal artifacts from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Paleolithic"] Middle Paleolithic
have been found mainly in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zagros_Mountains"] Zagros region, at sites such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwasi"] Warwasi and
Yafteh.[59][60] From the 10th to the seventh millennium BC, early agricultural
communities began to flourish in and around the Zagros region in western Iran,
 including Chogha Golan,[61][62] Chogha Bonut,[63][64] and Chogha
Mish.[65][66][67] 
A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting"] cave painting in Doushe cave,
The occupation of grouped hamlets in the area of Susa, as determined by
 radiocarbon dating, ranges from 4395–3955 to 3680–3490 BC.[68] There are 
Lorestan, from the 8th millennium
BC[57]
dozens of prehistoric sites across the Iranian Plateau, pointing to the existence of
ancient cultures and urban settlements in the fourth millennium BC.[67][69][70] During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age"] Bronze Age, the territory of
present-day Iran was home to several civilizations, including Elam, Jiroft, and Zayanderud. Elam, the most prominent of
these civilizations, developed in the southwest alongside those in Mesopotamia, and continued its existence until the
emergence of the Iranian empires. The advent of writing in Elam was paralleled to Sumer, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elamite_cuneiform"] Elamite cuneiform was
developed since the third millennium BC.[71]
Page 5
From the 34th to the 20th century BC, northwestern Iran was part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kura-Araxes_culture"] Kura-Araxes culture, which stretched into the
neighboring [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus"] Caucasus and Anatolia. Since the earliest second millennium BC, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria"] Assyrians settled in swaths of western Iran
and incorporated the region into their territories.
Classical antiquity
By the second millennium BC, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ancient_Iranian_peoples"] ancient Iranian peoples arrived in what is now
Iran from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Steppe"] Eurasian Steppe,[72] rivaling the native settlers of the region.[73][74]
As the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_peoples"] Iranians dispersed into the wider area of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Iran"] Greater Iran and beyond, the
boundaries of modern-day Iran were dominated by Median, Persian, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthia"] Parthian
tribes.
From the late 10th to the late seventh century BC, the Iranian peoples, together with
the "pre-Iranian" kingdoms, fell under the domination of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria"] Assyrian Empire,
based in northern Mesopotamia.[75] Under king Cyaxares, the Medes and Persians
entered into an alliance with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonia"] Babylonian ruler Nabopolassar, as well as the fellow 
A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief#Bas-relief_or_low_relief"] bas-relief at Persepolis, depicting
the united [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medes"] Medes and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persians"] Persians
Iranian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythians"] Scythians and Cimmerians, and together they attacked the Assyrian Empire.
The civil war ravaged the Assyrian Empire between 616 and 605 BC, thus freeing their respective peoples from three
centuries of Assyrian rule.[75] The unification of the Median tribes under king [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deioces"] Deioces in 728 BC led to the foundation of
the Median Empire which, by 612 BC, controlled almost the entire territory of present-day Iran and eastern Anatolia.[76]
This marked the end of the Kingdom of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urartu"] Urartu as well, which was subsequently conquered and dissolved.[77][78]
In 550 BC, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great"] Cyrus the Great, the son of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandane_of_Media"] Mandane and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambyses_I"] Cambyses I, took over the
Median Empire, and founded the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire"] Achaemenid Empire by unifying other city-states.
The conquest of Media was a result of what is called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Revolt"] Persian Revolt.  The
 brouhaha was initially triggered by the actions of the Median ruler Astyages, and
was quickly spread to other provinces as they allied with the Persians. Later
conquests under Cyrus and his successors expanded the empire to include Lydia,
Babylon, Egypt, parts of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans"] Balkans and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"] Eastern Europe proper, as well as the

Afghanistan, and much of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"] Central Asia, making it the largest empire the world had
yet seen.[16]
It is estimated that in 480 BC, 50 million people lived in the Achaemenid
Empire.[79][80] The empire at its peak ruled over 44% of the world's population, the
highest such figure for any empire in history.[81]
The Achaemenid Empire is noted for the release of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity"] Jewish exiles in Babylon,[82] building infrastructures such as the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Road"] Royal Road and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapar_Khaneh"] Chapar (postal service),  and the use of an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_language"] official language, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Aramaic#Imperial_Aramaic"] Imperial Aramaic, throughout its
territories.[16] The empire had a centralized, bureaucratic administration under the emperor, a large professional army, and
civil services, inspiring similar developments in later empires.[83][84]
Eventual conflict on the western borders began with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionian_Revolt"] Ionian Revolt, which erupted into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars"] Greco-Persian Wars and
continued through the first half of the fifth century BC, and ended with the withdrawal of the Achaemenids from all of the

Achaemenid emperor, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_III"] Darius III, at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Issus"] Battle of Issus. Following the premature
death of Alexander, Iran came under the control of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period"] Hellenistic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire"] Seleucid Empire.
In the middle of the second century BC, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire"] Parthian Empire rose to become the
main power in Iran, and the century-long geopolitical arch-rivalry between the
Romans and the Parthians began, culminating in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman%E2%80%93Parthian_Wars"] Roman–Parthian Wars. The
Parthian Empire continued as a feudal monarchy for nearly five centuries, until
224 CE, when it was succeeded by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire"] Sasanian Empire.[86] Together with their
neighboring arch-rival, the Roman-Byzantines, they made up the world's two most
dominant powers at the time, for over four centuries.[17][18]
The Sasanians established an empire within the frontiers achieved by the
Achaemenids, with their capital at Ctesiphon. Late antiquity is considered one of Iran's most influential periods, as under the
Sasanians their influence reached the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_ancient_Rome"] culture of ancient Rome (and through that as far as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe"] Western Europe),[87][88]
Africa,[89] China, and India,[90] and played a prominent role in the formation of the medieval art of both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_art"] Europe and
Asia.[91]
Most of the era of the Sasanian Empire was overshadowed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman%E2%80%93Persian_Wars"] Roman–Persian Wars, which raged on the western
borders at Anatolia, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Caucasus"] Western Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and the Levant, for over 700 years. These wars ultimately
exhausted both the Romans and the Sasanians and led to the defeat of both by the Muslim invasion.
Throughout the Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sasanian eras, several offshoots of the Iranian dynasties established [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eponym"] eponymous
branches in Anatolia and the Caucasus, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Pontus"] Pontic Kingdom, the Mihranids, and the Arsacid dynasties of
Armenia, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsacid_dynasty_of_Iberia"] Iberia (Georgia), and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsacid_dynasty_of_Caucasian_Albania"] Caucasian Albania (present-day Republic of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan"] Azerbaijan and southern Dagestan).
Medieval period
 The prolonged Byzantine–Sasanian wars, most importantly the climactic war of 602–628, as well as the social conflict
within the Sasanian Empire, opened the way for an Arab invasion of Iran in the seventh century.[92][93] The empire was
 initially defeated by the Rashidun Caliphate, which was succeeded by the Umayyad Caliphate, followed by the Abbasid
Caliphate. A prolonged and gradual process of state-imposed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamization_of_Iran"] Islamization followed, which targeted Iran's then Zoroastrian
majority and included religious persecution,[94][95][96] demolition of libraries[97] and fire temples,[98] a special tax penalty
("jizya"),[99][100] and language shift.[101][102]
In 750, the Abbasids overthrew the Umayyads.[103] Arabs Muslims and Persians of all strata made up the rebel army, which
was united by the converted Persian Muslim, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Muslim"] Abu Muslim.[104][105][106] In their struggle for power, the society in their
times gradually became cosmopolitan and the old Arab simplicity and aristocratic dignity, bearing and prestige were lost.
Persians and Turks began to replace the Arabs in most fields. The fusion of the Arab nobility with the subject races, the
practice of polygamy and concubinage, made for a social amalgam wherein loyalties became uncertain and a hierarchy of
officials emerged, a bureaucracy at first Persian and later Turkish which decreased Abbasid prestige and power for
good.[107]
After two centuries of Arab rule, semi-independent and independent Iranian kingdoms—including the Tahirids, Saffarids,
Samanids, and Buyids—began to appear on the fringes of the declining Abbasid Caliphate.
The blossoming literature, philosophy, mathematics, medicine, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age#Astronomy"] astronomy and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_art"] art of Iran became major elements in the
formation of a new age for the Iranian civilization, during a period known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age"] Islamic Golden Age.[111][112] The Islamic
Golden Age reached its peak by the 10th and 11th centuries, during which Iran was the main theater of scientific
activities.[113]
The cultural revival that began in the Abbasid period led to a resurfacing of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_nationalism"] Iranian national identity; thus, the attempts
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabization"] Arabization never succeeded in Iran. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shu%27ubiyya"] Shu'ubiyya movement became a catalyst for Iranians to regain independence in
their relations with the Arab invaders.[114] The most notable effect of this movement was the continuation of the Persian
language attested to the works of the epic poet Ferdowsi, now considered the most prominent figure in Iranian literature.
The 10th century saw a mass migration of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_tribal_confederations"] Turkic tribes from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"] Central Asia into the Iranian Plateau.[115] Turkic tribesmen
were first used in the Abbasid army as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamluk"] mamluks (slave-warriors), replacing Iranian and Arab elements within the army.[104]
As a result, the Mamluks gained significant political power. In 999, large portions of Iran came briefly under the rule of the
Ghaznavids, whose rulers were of mamluk Turkic origin, and longer subsequently under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuk_Empire"] Seljuk and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anushtegin_dynasty"] Khwarezmian
Page 7
empires.[115] The Seljuks subsequently gave rise to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultanate_of_Rum"] Sultanate of Rum in
Anatolia, while taking their thoroughly Persianized identity with them.[116][117] The
result of the adoption and patronage of Persian culture by Turkish rulers was the
development of a distinct [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turco-Persian_tradition"] Turco-Persian tradition.
 From 1219 to 1221, under the Khwarazmian Empire, Iran suffered a devastating
invasion by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire"] Mongol Empire army of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan"] Genghis Khan. According to Steven R.
Ward, "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_and_conquests"] Mongol violence and depredations killed up to three-fourths of the
population of the Iranian Plateau, possibly 10 to 15 million people. Some historians
have estimated that Iran's population did not again reach its pre-Mongol levels until
the mid-20th century."[118] Most modern historians either outright dismiss or are
highly skeptical of such statistics of colossal magnitude pertaining the Mongol
onslaught on the Khwarazmian empire, mainland Iran and other Muslim regions
and deem them to be exaggerations by Muslim chroniclers of that era (whose
recordings were naturally of an anti-Mongol bent). Indeed, as far as the Iranian
plateau was concerned, the bulk of the Mongol onslaught and battles were in the
northeast of what is modern-day Iran. Such as the cities of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nishapur"] Nishapur and
Tus.[119][120][121] 
 Tomb of Hafez, a medieval Persian
poet whose works are regarded as a
pinnacle in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_literature"] Persian literature and
have left a considerable mark on
later Western writers, most notably
 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Henry
David Thoreau, and
 Emerson[108][109][110]
Following the fracture of the Mongol Empire in 1256, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulagu_Khan"] Hulagu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, established the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilkhanate"] Ilkhanate
in Iran. In 1370, yet another conqueror, Timur, followed the example of Hulagu, establishing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timurid_Empire"] Timurid Empire which
lasted for another 156 years. In 1387, Timur ordered the complete massacre of Isfahan, reportedly killing 70,000
citizens.[122] The Ilkhans and the Timurids soon came to adopt the ways and customs of the Iranians, surrounding
themselves with a culture that was distinctively Iranian.[123]
Early modern period
Safavids
By the 1500s, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_I"] Ismail I of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardabil"] Ardabil established the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_Iran"] Safavid Empire,[124] with his capital at
Tabriz.[115] Beginning with Azerbaijan, he subsequently extended his authority over all of
the Iranian territories, and established an intermittent Iranian hegemony over the vast relative
regions, reasserting the Iranian identity within large parts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Iran"] Greater Iran.[125] Iran was
predominantly Sunni,[126] but Ismail instigated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_conversion_of_Iran_to_Shia_Islam"] a forced conversion to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam"] Shia branch of
Islam,[127] spreading throughout the Safavid territories in the Caucasus, Iran, Anatolia, and
Mesopotamia. As a result, modern-day Iran is the only official Shia nation of the world,
with it holding an absolute majority in Iran and the Republic of Azerbaijan, having there the
first and the second highest number of Shia inhabitants by population percentage in the
world.[128][129] Meanwhile, the centuries-long geopolitical and ideological rivalry between
 Safavid Iran and the neighboring Ottoman Empire led to numerous Ottoman–Iranian
wars.[118]
The Safavid era peaked in the reign of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbas_the_Great"] Abbas I (1587–1629),[118][130] surpassing their 
 Venetian portrait, kept at the
Uffizi, of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_I"] Ismail I, the
 founder of the Safavid
Turkish archrivals in strength, and making Iran a leading science and art hub in western Empire
Eurasia. The Safavid era saw the start of mass integration from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples_of_the_Caucasus"] Caucasian populations into
new layers of the society of Iran, as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands
of Iran, playing a pivotal role in the history of Iran for centuries onwards. Following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and
the early 1700s, which was caused by internal conflicts, the continuous wars with the Ottomans, and the foreign
interference (most notably the Russian interference), the Safavid rule was ended by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotak_dynasty"] Pashtun rebels who besieged Isfahan
and defeated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Husayn"] Sultan Husayn in 1722.
Afsharids
In 1729, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nader_Shah"] Nader Shah, a chieftain and military genius from Khorasan, successfully drove out and conquered the Pashtun
invaders. He subsequently took back the annexed Caucasian territories which [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Constantinople_(1724)"] were divided among the Ottoman and
 Russian authorities by the ongoing chaos in Iran. During the reign of Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest extent since the
Page 8
Sasanian Empire, reestablishing the Iranian hegemony all over the Caucasus, as well as
other major parts of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Asia"] west and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"] central Asia, and briefly possessing what was arguably the
most powerful empire at the time.[20]
Nader Shah [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nader_Shah%27s_invasion_of_the_Mughal_Empire"] invaded India and sacked far off Delhi
by the late 1730s. His territorial expansion, as well
as his military successes, went into a decline
 following the final campaigns in the Northern
Caucasus against then revolting Lezgins. The
assassination of Nader Shah sparked a brief period
of civil war and turmoil, after which [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karim_Khan_Zand"] Karim Khan of

economic power  Compared to its preceding dynasties, the geopolitical reach of the Zand dynasty was limited.
Many of the Iranian territories in the Caucasus gained de facto autonomy and were locally
ruled through various [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanates_of_the_Caucasus"] Caucasian khanates. However, despite the self-ruling, they all
remained [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commoner"] subjects and vassals to the Zand king.[131] Another civil war ensued after the death of Karim Khan in 1779, out of
which [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agha_Mohammad_Khan_Qajar"] Agha Mohammad Khan emerged, founding the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qajar_dynasty"] Qajar dynasty in 1794.
Qajars
In 1795, following the disobedience of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgians"] Georgian subjects and their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Georgievsk"] alliance with the Russians, the Qajars captured
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi"] Tbilisi by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Krtsanisi"] Battle of Krtsanisi, and drove the Russians out of the entire Caucasus, reestablishing the Iranian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzerainty"] suzerainty
over the region. 
The Russo-Iranian wars of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Persian_War_(1804%E2%80%9313)"] 1804–1813 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Persian_War_(1826%E2%80%9328)"] 1826–1828 resulted in large irrevocable
territorial losses for Iran in the Caucasus, comprising all of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Caucasus"] South Caucasus and
Dagestan, which made part of the very concept of Iran for centuries,[21] and thus
substantial gains for the neighboring Russian Empire.
As a result of the 19th-century Russo-Iranian wars, the Russians took over the
Caucasus, and Iran irrevocably lost control over its integral territories in the region
 (comprising modern-day Dagestan, Georgia, Armenia, and Republic of

Empire by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Persian_Wars"] Russo-Iranian wars 
As Iran shrank, many [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Caucasus"] South Caucasian and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Caucasus"] North Caucasian Muslims moved
 towards Iran,[139][140] especially until the aftermath of the Circassian
Genocide,[140] and the decades afterwards, while Iran's  Armenians were
encouraged to settle in the newly incorporated Russian territories,[141][142][143]
causing significant demographic shifts.
Around 1.5 million people—20 to 25% of the population of Iran—died as a result of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_famine_of_1870-1872"] Great Famine of 1870–1872.[144]
Between 1872 and 1905, a series of protests took place in response to the sale of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concession_(contract)"] concessions to foreigners by Qajar
 monarchs Naser-ed-Din and Mozaffar-ed-Din, and led to the Constitutional Revolution in 1905. The first Iranian
constitution and the first national parliament of Iran were founded in 1906, through the ongoing revolution. The
Constitution included the official recognition of Iran's three religious minorities, namely Christians, Jews, and
Zoroastrians,[145] which has remained a basis in the legislation of Iran since then. The struggle related to the constitutional
movement was followed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_of_Tehran"] Triumph of Tehran in 1909, when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Ali_Shah_Qajar"] Mohammad Ali Shah was defeated and forced to
abdicate. On the pretext of restoring order, the Russians occupied northern Iran in 1911 and maintained a military presence
 in the region for years to come. But this did not put an end to the civil uprisings and was soon followed by Mirza Kuchik
Khan's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_Movement_of_Gilan"] Jungle Movement against both the Qajar monarchy and foreign invaders.

Pahlavis
 In the midst of World War II, in June 1941, Nazi Germany broke the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and invaded the Soviet
Union, Iran's northern neighbor. The Soviets quickly allied themselves with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II"] Allied countries and in July and August,
1941 the British demanded that the Iranian government expel all Germans from Iran. Reza Shah refused to expel the
Germans and on 25 August 1941, the British and Soviets launched a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Soviet_invasion_of_Iran"] surprise invasion and Reza Shah's government quickly
 surrendered.[151] The invasion's strategic purpose was to secure a supply line to the USSR (later named the Persian
Corridor), secure the oil fields and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abadan_Refinery"] Abadan Refinery (of the UK-owned [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Iranian_Oil_Company"] Anglo-Iranian Oil Company), prevent a German
advance via Turkey or the USSR on Baku's oil fields, and limit German influence in Iran. Following the invasion, on 16
September 1941 Reza Shah abdicated and was replaced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi"] Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, his 21-year-old son.[152][153][154]
 During the rest of World War II, Iran became a major conduit for British and
 American aid to the Soviet Union and an avenue through which over 120,000
Polish refugees and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders%27_Army"] Polish Armed Forces fled the Axis advance.[155] At the 1943

independence and boundaries of Iran. However, at the end of the war, Soviet troops
remained in Iran and established two puppet states in north-western Iran, namely the
 People's Government of Azerbaijan and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Mahabad"] Republic of Mahabad. This led to the
 Iran crisis of 1946, one of the first confrontations of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War"] Cold War, which ended
after oil concessions were promised to the USSR and Soviet forces withdrew from
Iran proper in May 1946. The two puppet states were soon overthrown, and the oil
concessions were later revoked.[156][157]

1951–1978: Mosaddegh, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
 In 1951, Mohammad Mosaddegh was appointed as the Prime Minister of Pahlavi Iran. After the nationalization of Iran's oil
industry, he became enormously popular. He was deposed in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_Iranian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"] 1953 Iranian coup d'état, an Anglo-American covert
operation that marked the first time the United States had participated in an overthrow of a foreign government during the
 Cold War.[158]
After the coup, the Shah became increasingly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy"] autocratic and sultanistic, and Iran entered a decades-long phase of
controversially close relations with the United States and some other foreign governments.[159] While the Shah increasingly
modernized Iran and claimed to retain it as a fully [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_state"] secular state,[23] arbitrary arrests and torture by his secret police, the
SAVAK, were used for crushing all forms of political opposition.[160]

 Ruhollah Khomeini, a radical Muslim cleric,[161] became an active critic of the
Shah's far-reaching series of reforms known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Revolution"] White Revolution. Khomeini
publicly denounced the government, and was arrested and imprisoned for 18
months. After his release in 1964, he refused to apologize and was eventually sent
into exile.
Due to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis"] 1973 spike in oil prices, the economy of Iran was flooded with foreign
currency, which caused inflation. By 1974, the economy of Iran was experiencing a
double-digit inflation rate, and despite the many large projects to modernize the
country, corruption was rampant and caused [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_and_causes_of_the_Iranian_Revolution#1970%E2%80%931975"] large amounts of waste. By 1975 and
1976, an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession"] economic recession led to an increased unemployment rate, especially
among millions of youths who had migrated to the cities of Iran looking for
construction jobs during the boom years of the early 1970s. By the late 1970s, many
of these people opposed the Shah's regime and began organizing and joining the
protests against it.[162]

After the 1979 Iranian Revolution
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution"] 1979 Revolution, later known as the Islamic Revolution,[163][164][165] began in
 January 1978 with the first major demonstrations against the Shah.[166] After a year of
 strikes and demonstrations paralyzing the country and its economy, Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi fled to the United States, and Ruhollah Khomeini returned from exile to Tehran in
February 1979, forming a new government.[167] After holding [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1979_Iranian_Islamic_Republic_referendum"] a referendum, Iran officially
became an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_republic"] Islamic republic in April 1979.[168] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/December_1979_Iranian_constitutional_referendum"] A second referendum in December 1979
approved [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran"] a theocratic constitution.[169]
 The immediate nationwide uprisings against the new government began with the 1979
 Kurdish rebellion and the Khuzestan uprisings, along with the uprisings in Sistan and
 Baluchestan and other areas. Over the next several years, these uprisings were subdued
 violently by the new Islamic government. The new government began purging itself of the
non-Islamist political opposition, as well as of those Islamists who were not considered
radical enough. Although both nationalists and Marxists had initially joined with Islamists to 
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhollah_Khomeini%27s_return_to_Iran"] Ruhollah Khomeini's return
to Iran on 1 February 1979
overthrow the Shah, tens of thousands were executed by the new regime afterward.[170]
Following Khomeini's order to purge the new government of any remaining officials still loyal to the exiled Shah, many
former ministers and officials in the Shah's government, including former prime minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir-Abbas_Hoveyda"] Amir-Abbas Hoveyda, were
executed.
On 4 November 1979, after the United States refusal for the extradition of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to the new
 government, a group of Muslim students seized the United States Embassy and took the embassy with 52 personnel and
citizens hostage .[171] Attempts by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter"] Jimmy Carter administration to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis_negotiations"] negotiate for the release of the hostages, and a failed
 rescue attempt, helped with the falling popularity of Carter among the US citizens and it pushed him out of the presidential
office and brought [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan"] Ronald Reagan to power. On Jimmy Carter's final day in office, the last hostages were finally set free
due to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers_Accords"] Algiers Accords. Mohammad Reza Pahlavi left the United States for Egypt, where he died of complications from
cancer only months later, on 27 July 1980.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Cultural_Revolution"] Cultural Revolution began in 1980, with an initial closure of universities for three years, in order to perform an
inspection and clean up in the cultural policy of the education and training system.[172]
On 22 September 1980, the Iraqi army [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War#1980:_Iraqi_invasion"] invaded the western Iranian province of Khuzestan, initiating the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War"] Iran–Iraq War.
Although the forces of Saddam Hussein made several early advances, by mid-1982, the Iranian forces successfully
managed to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War#1982:_Iraqi_retreat,_Iranian_offensive"] drive the Iraqi army back into Iraq. In July 1982, with Iraq thrown on the defensive, the regime of Iran decided
to invade Iraq and conducted countless offensives to conquer Iraqi territory and capture cities, such as Basra. The war
continued until 1988 when the Iraqi army defeated the Iranian forces inside Iraq and pushed the remaining Iranian troops
back across the border. Subsequently, Khomeini accepted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_598"] a truce mediated by the United Nations. The total Iranian
 casualties in the war were estimated to be 123,220–160,000 KIA, 60,711 MIA, and 11,000–16,000 civilians
killed.[173][174]

Following the Iran–Iraq War, in 1989,
 Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his
administration concentrated on a pragmatic
pro-business policy of rebuilding and
strengthening the economy without making
any dramatic break with the ideology of the
revolution. In 1997, Rafsanjani was
succeeded by moderate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_reform_movement"] reformist

country,[181][182] and the creation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Green_Movement"] Iranian Green Movement.

The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318_Iranian_protests"] 2017–18 Iranian protests swept across the country against the government and
its longtime Supreme Leader in response to the economic and political
situation.[186] The scale of protests throughout the country and the number of
people participating were significant,[187] and it was formally confirmed that
thousands of protesters were arrested.[188] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Iranian_protests"] 2019–20 Iranian protests started on
15 November in Ahvaz, spreading across the country within hours, after the
 government announced increases in the fuel price of up to 300%.[189] A week-long
total Internet shutdown throughout the country marked one of the most severe
Internet blackouts in any country, and in the bloodiest governmental crackdown of
the protestors in the history of Islamic Republic,[190] tens of thousands were
arrested and hundreds were killed within a few days according to multiple
international observers, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International"] Amnesty International.[191]
On 3 January 2020, the revolutionary guard's general, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani"] Qasem Soleimani, was
 assassinated by the United States in Iraq, which considerably heightened the existing tensions between the two

discontinuous plains are found along the remaining coast of the Persian Gulf, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strait_of_Hormuz"] Strait of Hormuz, and the Gulf of Oman.
Climate
Having 11 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate"] climates out of the world's 13, Iran's climate is diverse,[199] ranging from
 arid and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-arid_climate"] semi-arid, to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics"] subtropical along the Caspian coast and the northern
forests.[200] On the northern edge of the country (the Caspian coastal plain),
temperatures rarely fall below freezing and the area remains humid for the rest of the
year. Summer temperatures rarely exceed 29 °C (84.2 °F).[201][202] Annual
precipitation is 680 mm (26.8 in) in the eastern part of the plain and more than
1,700 mm (66.9 in) in the western part. Gary Lewis, the United Nations Resident
Coordinator for Iran, has said that "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity"] Water scarcity poses the most severe human

foreign policy.[221] The president-elect is required to gain the Leader Khamenei's
official approval before being sworn in before the Parliament (Majlis). Through this
process, known as Tanfiz (validation), the Leader agrees to the outcome of the
presidential election. The Supreme Leader is directly involved in ministerial
appointments for Defense, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs, as well as other top
ministries after submission of candidates from the president.[233] Iran's regional
policy is directly controlled by the office of the Supreme Leader with the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs' task limited to protocol and ceremonial occasions. All of Iran's
ambassadors to Arab countries, for example, are chosen by the Quds Corps, which

as withdrawing money from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Development_Fund_of_Iran"] National Development Fund of Iran, require Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's approval and
permission. The Supreme Leader Khamenei can and did order laws to be amended.[234] Setad, estimated at $95 billion in
2013 by the Reuters, accounts of which are secret even to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_parliament"] Iranian parliament,[235][236] is controlled only by the

The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran"] Supreme Leader is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief"] commander-in-chief of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_the_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran"] armed forces, controls the
military intelligence and security operations, and has sole power to declare war or
peace.[220] The heads of the judiciary, the state radio and television networks, the
commanders of the police and military forces, and six of the twelve members of the
 Guardian Council are directly appointed by the Supreme Leader.[220]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_Experts"] Assembly of Experts is responsible for electing the Supreme Leader, and has
the power to dismiss him on the basis of qualifications and popular esteem.[239] To
date, the Assembly of Experts has not challenged any of the Supreme Leader's
decisions, nor has it attempted to dismiss him.[240] The previous head of the judicial
system, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadeq_Larijani"] Sadeq Larijani, appointed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran"] Supreme Leader, said that it is illegal for
the Assembly of Experts to supervise the Supreme Leader.[241] Due to Khamenei's 
Ali Khamenei voting in the 2017
presidential election
very longtime unchallenged rule, many believe the Assembly of Experts has become a ceremonial body without any real
power.[242][243][244][245] There have been instances when the current Supreme Leader publicly criticized members of the
Assembly of Experts, resulting in their arrest and dismissal. For example, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khamenei"] Khamenei publicly called then-member of the
Assembly of Experts [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Azari_Qomi"] Ahmad Azari Qomi a traitor, resulting in Qomi's arrest and eventual dismissal from the Assembly of
Experts. Another instance is when Khamenei indirectly called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar_Hashemi_Rafsanjani"] Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani a traitor for a statement he made,
causing Rafsanjani to retract it.[246]
Guardian Council
Page 15
Presidential candidates and parliamentary candidates must be approved by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardian_Council"] Guardian Council (all members of which are
 directly or indirectly appointed by the Leader) or the Leader before running to ensure their allegiance to the Supreme
Leader.[247] The Leader very rarely does the vetting himself directly but has the power to do so, in which case additional
approval of the Guardian Council would not be needed. The Leader can also revert the decisions of the Guardian
Council.[248] The Guardian Council can, and has dismissed some elected members of the Iranian parliament in the past.[249]
For example, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoo_Khaleghi"] Minoo Khaleghi was disqualified by Guardian Council even after winning election, as she had been
photographed in a meeting without wearing headscarf.[250]
President
After the Supreme Leader, the Constitution defines the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Iran"] President of Iran as the
highest state authority.[220][254] The President is elected by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage"] universal suffrage for a
term of four years, however, the president is still required to gain the Leader's
official approval before being sworn in before the Parliament (Majlis). The Leader
also has the power to dismiss the elected president anytime.[255] The President can
only be re-elected for one term.[254]
The President is responsible for the implementation of the constitution, and for the
exercise of executive powers in implementing the decrees and general policies as
outlined by the Supreme Leader, except for matters directly related to the Supreme
Leader, who has the final say in all matters.[220] Unlike the executive in other

allies.[251][252][253]
 Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran sets forth the qualifications for
presidential candidates. The procedures for presidential election and all other elections in Iran are outlined by the Supreme
Leader.[230][256] The President functions as the executive of affairs such as signing treaties and other international
agreements, and administering national planning, budget, and state employment affairs, all as approved by the Supreme
Leader.[223][224][256][225][226][227][228][257]
The President appoints the ministers, subject to the approval of the Parliament, as well as the approval of the Supreme
Leader, who can dismiss or reinstate any of the ministers at any time, regardless of the decisions made by the President or
the Parliament.[231][232][258] The President supervises the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Ministers_of_Iran"] Council of Ministers, coordinates government decisions, and
selects government policies to be placed before the legislature.[259] The current Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, has fired as
well as reinstated Council of Ministers members.[260][261] Eight Vice Presidents serve under the President, as well as a
cabinet of twenty-two ministers, who must all be approved by the legislature.[262]
Legislature
The legislature of Iran, known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Consultative_Assembly"] Islamic Consultative Assembly, is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicameralism"] unicameral
body comprising 290 members elected for four-year terms.[263] It drafts legislation,
ratifies international treaties, and approves the national budget. All parliamentary
candidates and all legislation from the assembly must be approved by the Guardian
Council.[264]
The Guardian Council comprises twelve jurists, including six appointed by the
Supreme Leader. Others are elected by the Parliament, from among the jurists
nominated by the Head of the Judiciary.[265][266] The Council interprets the
constitution and may veto the Parliament. If a law is deemed incompatible with the

The Supreme Leader appoints the head of the country's judiciary, appointing the head of the Supreme Court and the chief
public prosecutor.[240] There are several types of courts, including public courts that deal with civil and criminal cases, and
 revolutionary courts which deal with certain categories of offenses, such as crimes against [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security"] national security. The decisions
of the revolutionary courts are final and cannot be appealed.[240]
The Chief Justice of Iran is the head of the Judicial system of the Islamic Republic of Iran and is responsible for its
administration and supervision. He is also the highest judge of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Iran"] Supreme Court of Iran. The Supreme Leader of Iran
appoints and can dismiss the Chief Justice. The Chief Justice nominates some candidates for serving as minister of justice,
and then the President select one of them. The Chief Justice can serve for two five-year terms.[268]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Clerical_Court"] Special Clerical Court handles crimes allegedly committed by clerics, although it has also taken on cases involving
laypeople. The Special Clerical Court functions independently of the regular judicial framework, and is accountable only to
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_of_Iran"] Supreme Leader. The Court's rulings are final and cannot be appealed.[240] The Assembly of Experts, which meets for
one week annually, comprises 86 "virtuous and learned" clerics elected by adult suffrage for eight-year terms.
Foreign relations 
Since the time of the 1979 Revolution, Iran's foreign relations have often been
portrayed as being based on two strategic principles; eliminating outside influences
 in the region, and pursuing extensive diplomatic contacts with developing and non-
aligned countries.[269]

Since 2005, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran"] Iran's nuclear program has become the subject of contention with the
international community, mainly the United States. Many countries have expressed
concern that Iran's nuclear program could divert civilian nuclear technology into a
 weapons program. This has led the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council"] United Nations Security Council to impose
 sanctions against Iran which had further isolated Iran politically and economically
 from the rest of the global community. In 2009, the U.S. Director of National
Intelligence said that Iran, if choosing to, would not be able to develop a nuclear
As of 2009, the government of Iran maintains diplomatic relations with 99 members

state which Iran's government has derecognized since the 1979 Revolution.[272]
Among Muslim nations, Iran has an adversarial relationship with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_relations"] Saudi Arabia due
to different political and Islamic ideologies. While Iran is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia"] Shia Islamic Republic,
 Saudi Arabia is a conservative Sunni monarchy.[273] Regarding the Israeli–

members of the Basij who could potentially be called up for service.
GlobalSecurity.org estimates Iran could mobilize "up to one million men", which
would be among the largest troop mobilizations in the world.[282] In 2007, Iran's

Since the 1979 Revolution, to overcome foreign embargoes, the government of Iran has developed its own military industry,
produced its own tanks, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_personnel_carrier"] armored personnel carriers, missiles, submarines, military vessels, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_frigate_Jamaran"] missile destroyer, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar"] radar systems,

In June 1925, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reza_Shah"] Reza Shah introduced conscription law at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Consultative_Majlis"] National Consultative Majlis. At that time, every male person who
had reached 21 years old must serve in the military for two years. The conscription exempted women from military service
after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_revolution"] 1979 revolution. Iranian constitution obliges all men of 18 years old and higher to serve on military or police bases.
They cannot leave the country or be employed without completion of the service period.[292] The period varies from 18 to
24 months.
Human rights
According to international reports, Iran's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_the_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran"] human rights record is exceptionally poor. The regime in Iran is
undemocratic,[293][294] has frequently persecuted and arrested critics of the government and its Supreme Leader, and
severely restricts the participation of candidates in popular elections as well as other forms of political activity.[295][296]
 Women's rights in Iran are described as seriously inadequate,[297] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_rights"] children's rights have been severely violated, with
more child offenders being executed in Iran than in any other country in the world.[298][299] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Iran"] Sexual activity between
members of the same sex is illegal and is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_penalty_for_homosexuality"] punishable by up to death.[300][301]
 Over the past decade, numbers of anti-government protests have broken out throughout Iran (such as the 2019–20 Iranian
protests), demanding reforms or the end to the Islamic Republic. However, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRGC"] IRGC and police often suppressed mass
protests violently, resulting in thousands of protesters being killed.
In January 2021, Iranian authorities added Signal to the list of blocked social media platforms, which included Facebook,
Telegram, Twitter and YouTube. They carried out arbitrary arrests for social media postings deemed "counter-revolutionary"
or "un-Islamic".[302]
Economy
 Iran's economy is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy"] mixture of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy"] central planning, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_ownership"] state ownership of oil and other large enterprises, village agriculture, and
small-scale private trading and service ventures.[303] In 2017, GDP was $427.7 billion ($1.631 trillion at PPP), or $20,000
at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity"] PPP per capita.[3] Iran is ranked as an lower-middle income economy by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank"] World Bank.[304] In the early 21st century,
Page 18
the service sector contributed the largest percentage of the GDP, followed by
industry ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Iran"] mining and manufacturing) and agriculture.[305]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_the_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran"] Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran is responsible for developing and
maintaining the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_rial"] Iranian rial, which serves as the country's currency. The
government does not recognize [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trade_unions#Iran"] trade unions other than the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_labor_law"] Islamic labour councils,
which are subject to the approval of employers and the security services.[306] The
minimum wage in June 2013 was 487 million rials a month ($134).[307]
Unemployment has remained above 10% since 1997, and the unemployment rate
for women is almost double that of the men.[307]
In 2006, about 45% of the government's budget came from oil and natural gas
revenues, and 31% came from taxes and fees.[308] As of 2007, Iran had earned $70
billion in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign-exchange_reserves"] foreign-exchange reserves, mostly (80%) from crude oil exports.[309]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_subsidy_reform_plan"] Iranian budget deficits have been a chronic problem, mostly due to large-scale state
subsidies, that include foodstuffs and especially gasoline, totaling more than $84
 billion in 2008 for the energy sector alone.[310][311] In 2010, the economic reform
plan was approved by parliament to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_subsidy_reform_plan"] cut subsidies gradually and replace them with

The administration continues to follow the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_subsidy_reform_plan"] market reform plans of the previous one,
and indicates that it will diversify Iran's oil-reliant economy. Iran has also developed
a biotechnology, nanotechnology, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceuticals_in_Iran"] pharmaceutical industry.[313] However,
nationalized industries such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonyad"] bonyads have often been managed badly, making
them ineffective and uncompetitive with years. Currently, the
government is trying to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization_in_Iran"] privatize these industries, and, despite
successes, there are still several problems to be overcome, such as the
 lagging corruption in the public sector and lack of competitiveness. 
Historical GDP per capita
development
Iran has leading manufacturing industries in the fields of automobile
manufacture, transportation, construction materials, home appliances,
food and agricultural goods, armaments, pharmaceuticals, information
technology, and petrochemicals in the Middle East.[314] According to
the 2012 data from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization"] Food and Agriculture Organization, Iran has
 been among the world's top five producers of apricots, cherries, sour
cherries, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber"] cucumbers and gherkins, dates, eggplants, figs, pistachios,

Economic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctions_against_Iran"] sanctions against Iran, such as the embargo against Iranian
crude oil, have injured the economy.[316] In 2015, Iran and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P5%2B1"] P5+1 reached a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action"] deal on the nuclear program that removed
 the main sanctions pertaining to Iran's nuclear program by 2016.[317] According to the BBC, renewed U.S. sanctions
against Iran "have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, quadrupling
its annual inflation rate, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests."[318]
Tourism
Although tourism declined significantly during the war with Iraq, it has been
subsequently recovered.[320] About 1,659,000 foreign tourists visited Iran in 2004,
and 2.3 million in 2009, mostly from Asian countries, including the republics of
 Central Asia, while about 10% came from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"] European Union and North
America.[321][322] Since the removal of some sanctions against Iran in 2015,
tourism has re-surged in the country. Over five million tourists visited Iran in the
fiscal year of 2014–2015, four percent more than the previous year.[323][324]

Several organized tours from Germany, France, and other European countries come to Iran annually to visit archaeological
sites and monuments. In 2003, Iran ranked 68th in tourism revenues worldwide.[327] According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO"] UNESCO and the
 deputy head of research for Iran's Tourism Organization, Iran is rated fourth among the top 10 destinations in the Middle
East.[327] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_tourism"] Domestic tourism in Iran is one of the largest in the world.[328][329][330] Weak advertising, unstable regional
conditions, a poor public image in some parts of the world, and absence of efficient planning schemes in the tourism sector
have all hindered the growth of tourism.
Transportation
Iran has a long paved road system linking most of its towns and all of its cities. In 2011 the country had 173,000 kilometers
(107,000 mi) of roads, of which 73% were paved.[331] In 2008 there were nearly 100 passenger cars for every 1,000
inhabitants.[332]
Trains operate on 11,106 km (6,942 mi) of railroad track.[333] The country's major port of entry is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar-Abbas"] Bandar-Abbas on the
 Strait of Hormuz. After arriving in Iran, imported goods are distributed throughout the country by trucks and freight trains.
The Tehran–[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar-Abbas"] Bandar-Abbas railroad, opened in 1995, connects Bandar-Abbas to the railroad system of Central Asia via
Tehran and Mashhad. Other major ports include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar-e_Anzali"] Bandar e-Anzali and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_Torkaman"] Bandar e-Torkeman on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea"] Caspian Sea and

[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airports_in_Iran"] Dozens of cities have airports that serve passenger and cargo planes. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air"] Iran Air, the national airline, was founded in 1962 and
operated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_destinations"] domestic and international flights. All large cities have mass transit systems using buses, and several private
companies provide bus services between cities.
 Transport in Iran is inexpensive because of the government's subsidization of the price of gasoline. The downside is a huge
 draw on government coffers, economic inefficiency because of highly wasteful consumption patterns, smuggling to
neighboring countries and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues_in_Iran"] air pollution. In 2008, more than one million people worked in the transportation sector,
accounting for 9% of GDP.[334]
Energy
Iran has the world's second largest proved [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas_reserves_in_Iran"] gas reserves after Russia, with 33.6

and Russia. It also ranks fourth in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserves_in_Iran"] oil reserves with an estimated 153,600,000,000
 barrels.[337][338] It is OPEC's second largest oil exporter, and is an energy
superpower.[339]In 2005, Iran spent US$4 billion on fuel imports, because of
 contraband and inefficient domestic use.[340] Oil industry output averaged 4 million
barrels per day (640,000 m3/d) in 2005, compared with the peak of six million
barrels per day reached in 1974. In the early 2000s, industry infrastructure was
increasingly inefficient because of technological lags. Few exploratory [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_well"] wells were
drilled in 2005.
In 2004, a large share of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas_reserves_in_Iran"] Iran's natural gas reserves were untapped. The addition of
new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity"] hydroelectric stations and the streamlining of conventional coal and oil-fired
stations increased installed capacity to 33,000 megawatts. Of that amount, about
75% was based on natural gas, 18% on oil, and 7% on hydroelectric power. In
2004, Iran opened its first wind-powered and geothermal plants, and the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power"] solar
thermal plant was to come online in 2009. Iran is the world's third country to have
developed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_to_liquids"] GTL technology.[341] 
Iran holds 10% of the world's proven
 oil reserves and 15% of its gas. It is
 OPEC's second-largest exporter and
the world's 7th largest oil
producer.[335]
 Demographic trends and intensified industrialization have caused [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power"] electric power demand to grow by 8% per year. The
 government's goal of 53,000 megawatts of installed capacity by 2010 is to be reached by bringing on line new gas-fired
plants, and adding hydropower and nuclear power generation capacity. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushehr_Nuclear_Power_Plant"] Iran's first nuclear power plant at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushire"] Bushire went
online in 2011. It is the second [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant"] nuclear power plant ever built in the Middle East after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metsamor_Nuclear_Power_Plant"] Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant in

Education, science and technology
Page 20
 Education in Iran is highly centralized. K–12 is supervised by the Ministry of
 Education, and higher education is under the supervision of the Ministry of Science
and Technology. According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fars_News_Agency"] Fars News Agency, the adult literacy rated 93.0% in
September 2015,[344] while according to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO"] UNESCO it had rated 85.0% in 2008 (up
from 36.5% in 1976).[345]
According to the data provided by UNESCO, Iran's literacy rate among people
aged 15 years and older was 85.54% as of 2016, with men (90.35%) being
significantly more educated than women (80.79%), with the number of illiterate
people of the same age amounting to around 8,700,000 of the country's 85 million
population.[346] According to this report, Iranian government's expenditure on
education amounts to around 4% of the GDP.

The completion
of the pre-university course earns students the Pre-University Certificate.[347]
Iran's higher education is sanctioned by different levels of diplomas, including an
 associate degree (kārdāni; also known as fowq e diplom) delivered in two years, a
 bachelor's degree (kāršenāsi; also known as lisāns) delivered in four years, and a
 master's degree (kāršenāsi e aršad) delivered in two years, after which another
exam allows the candidate to pursue a doctoral program (PhD; known as

Demographics 
 Simorgh launch, Iranian Space
Agency
Iran is a diverse country, consisting of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicities_in_Iran"] numerous ethnic and linguistic
groups that are unified through a shared Iranian nationality.[370]
Iran's population grew rapidly during the latter half of the 20th
century, increasing from about 19 million in 1956 to more than 84
million by July 2020.[371][372] However, Iran's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate"] fertility rate has
dropped significantly in recent years, coming down from a fertility
rate of 6.5 per woman to just a little more than 2 two decades
later,[373][374] leading to a population growth rate of about 1.39% as
of 2018.[375] Due to its young population, studies project that the
growth will continue to slow until it stabilizes around 105 million by
2050.[376][377][378]
Iran hosts one of the largest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"] refugee populations in the world, with
almost one million refugees,[379] mostly from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_refugees"] Afghanistan and
Iraq.[380] Since 2006, Iranian officials have been working with the
 UNHCR and Afghan officials for their repatriation.[381] According
to estimates, about five million Iranian citizens have emigrated to
other countries, mostly since the 1979 Revolution.[382][383]
According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran"] Iranian Constitution, the government is required to
provide every citizen of the country with access to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_security"] social security,
covering retirement, unemployment, old age, disability, accidents,
calamities, health and medical treatment and care services.[384] This
is covered by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_Iran"] tax revenues and income derived from public
contributions.[385]
Languages  Population of Iranian provinces and counties in 2021.
The majority of the population speaks Persian, which is also the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_language"] official language of
the country. Others include speakers of several other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_languages"] Iranian languages within the
greater [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages"] Indo-European family and languages belonging to some other ethnicities
living in Iran.
In northern Iran, mostly confined to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilan_Province"] Gilan and Mazenderan, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilaki_language"] Gilaki and
 Mazenderani languages are widely spoken, both having affinities to the neighboring
 Caucasian languages. In parts of Gilan, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talysh_language"] Talysh language is also widely spoken,
which stretches up to the neighboring [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan"] Republic of Azerbaijan. Varieties of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_languages"] Kurdish
are widely spoken in the province of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Province"] Kurdistan and nearby areas. In Khuzestan,
 several distinct varieties of Persian are spoken. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luri_language"] Luri and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achomi_language"] Lari are also spoken in
southern Iran. 
Iran's population growth (1880–2016)
 Azerbaijani, which is by far the most spoken language in the country after Persian,[386] as well as several other Turkic
languages and dialects, is spoken in various regions of Iran, especially in the region of Azerbaijan.
Page 22
Notable minority languages in Iran include Armenian, Georgian, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Aramaic_languages"] Neo-Aramaic, and Arabic. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khuzestani_Arabic"] Khuzi Arabic is spoken by the
 Arabs in Khuzestan, as well as the wider group of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Arabs"] Iranian Arabs. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassian_languages"] Circassian was also once widely spoken by the large
Circassian minority, but, due to assimilation over the many years, no sizable number of Circassians speak the language
anymore.[387][388][389][390]
Percentages of spoken language continue to be a point of debate, as many opt that they are politically motivated; most
notably regarding the largest and second largest ethnicities in Iran, the Persians and Azerbaijanis. Percentages given by the
 CIA's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Factbook"] World Factbook include 53% Persian, 16% Azerbaijani, 10% Kurdish, 7% [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazanderani_language"] Mazenderani and Gilaki, 7% Luri, 2%
Turkmen, 2% Balochi, 2% Arabic, and 2% the remainder Armenian, Georgian, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Aramaic_languages"] Neo-Aramaic, and Circassian.[3]
Ethnic groups
As with the spoken languages, the ethnic group composition also remains a point of
debate, mainly regarding the largest and second largest ethnic groups, the Persians
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Factbook"] and Azerbaijanis, due to the lack of Iranian state censuses based on ethnicity. The
CIA's World Factbook has estimated that around 79% of the population of Iran is a
diverse [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-Europeans"] Indo-European [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnolinguistics"] ethno-linguistic group that comprise speakers of various
 Iranian languages,[391] with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_people"] Persians (including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazanderani_people"] Mazenderanis and Gilaks)
constituting 61% of the population, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurds"] Kurds 10%, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lurs"] Lurs 6%, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baloch_people"] Balochs 2%. Peoples
of other ethnolinguistic groups make up the remaining 21%, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Azerbaijanis"] Azerbaijanis
constituting 16%, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs"] Arabs 2%, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmens"] Turkmens and other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples"] Turkic tribes 2%, and others (such
as Armenians, Talysh, Georgians, Circassians, Assyrians) 1%.[3] 
Iran's provinces by population
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress"] Library of Congress issued slightly different estimates: 65% Persians (including density (2013)
Mazenderanis, Gilaks, and the Talysh), 16% Azerbaijanis, 7% Kurds, 6% Lurs, 2%
Baloch, 1% Turkic tribal groups (incl. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qashqai_people"] Qashqai and Turkmens), and non-Iranian,
non-Turkic groups (incl. Armenians, Georgians, Assyrians, Circassians, and Arabs) less than 3%. It determined that Persian
is the first language of at least 65% of the country's population, and is the second language for most of the remaining
35%.[392]
Religion
 Twelver Shia Islam is the official [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion"] state religion, to which about 90% to
95%[394][395] of the population adhere. About 4% to 8% of the population
are Sunni Muslims, mainly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Kurds"] Kurds and Baloches. The remaining 2% are non-
Muslim religious minorities, including Christians, Zoroastrians, Jews,
 Baháʼís, Mandeans, and Yarsanis.[3][396]

around 90–95% of Iranian Muslims associate themselves with the Shia branch of Islam, the official state religion, and about
5–10% with the Sunni and Sufi branches of Islam.[403]
There are a large population of adherents of Yarsanism, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurds_in_Iran"] Kurdish indigenous religion, making it the largest (unrecognized)
 minority religion in Iran. Its followers are mainly Gorani Kurds and certain groups of Lurs. They are based in Kurdistan
Province, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermanshah_Province"] Kermanshah Province and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorestan"] Lorestan mainly.
Christianity, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and the Sunni branch of Islam are officially recognized by the government and have
reserved seats in the Iranian Parliament.[145] Historically, early [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_religions"] Iranian religions such as the Proto-Iranic religion and the
subsequent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism"] Zoroastrianism and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism"] Manichaeism were the dominant religions in Iran, particularly during the Median,
Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sasanian eras. This changed after the fall of the Sasanian Empire by the centuries-long
Page 23
 Islamization that followed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Persia"] Muslim Conquest of Iran. Iran was predominantly Sunni until the conversion of the country
 (as well as the people of what is today the neighboring Republic of Azerbaijan) to Shia Islam by order of the Safavid
dynasty in the 16th century.[126]
 Judaism has a long history in Iran, dating back to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Babylon"] Achaemenid conquest of Babylonia. Although many left in the wake
of the establishment of the State of Israel and the 1979 Revolution, about 8,756[404] to 25,000[405] Jewish people live in
Iran. Iran has the largest Jewish population in the Middle East outside of Israel.[406]
Around 250,000 to 370,000 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Iran"] Christians reside in Iran,[407][408] and Christianity is the country's largest recognized minority
religion.[409] Most are of Armenian background, as well as a sizable minority of Assyrians.[410] A large number of Iranians
have converted to Christianity from the predominant [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam"] Shia Islam.[411][412][413][414]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Special_Rapporteur_on_Human_Rights_in_Iran"] The Baháʼí Faith is not officially recognized and has been subject to official persecution.[415] According to the United
Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran, Baháʼís are the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran, with an
estimated 350,000 adherents.[416] Since the 1979 Revolution, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%ADs"] persecution of Baháʼís has increased with executions and
denial of civil rights, especially the denial of access to higher education and employment.[415][417][418]
Iranian officials have continued to support the rebuilding and renovation of Armenian churches in the Islamic Republic. The
 Armenian Monastic Ensembles of Iran has also received continued support. In 2019, the Iranian government registered the
 Holy Savior Cathedral, commonly referred to as Vank Cathedral, in the New Julfa district of Isfahan, as a UNESCO World
Heritage Site, with significant expenditures for its congregation. Currently three Armenian churches in Iran have been
included in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_World_Heritage_List"] UNESCO World Heritage List.[419][420]
Culture
The earliest attested cultures in Iran date back to the Lower Paleolithic. Owing to its geopolitical position, Iran has
influenced cultures as far as Greece and Italy to the west, Russia to the north, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula"] Arabian Peninsula to the south, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"] south
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"] east Asia to the east.
Art
The art of Iran encompasses many disciplines, including architecture, stonemasonry,
metalworking, weaving, pottery, painting, and calligraphy. Iranian works of art
show a great variety in style, in different regions and periods.[421] The art of the
 Medes remains obscure, but has been theoretically attributed to the Scythian
style.[422] The Achaemenids borrowed heavily from the art of their neighboring
 civilizations,[423] but produced a synthesis of a unique style,[424] with an eclectic
architecture remaining at sites such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis"] Persepolis and Pasargadae. Greek
iconography was imported by the Seleucids, followed by the recombination of
 Hellenistic and earlier Near Eastern elements in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_art"] art of the Parthians,[425] with
remains such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Anahita,_Kangavar"] Temple of Anahita and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statue,_National_Museum_of_Iran_2401"] Statue of the Parthian Nobleman. By
the time of the Sasanians, Iranian art came across a general renaissance.[426]
Although of unclear development,[427] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_art"] Sasanian art was highly influential, and
spread into far regions. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taq_Bostan"] Taq-e-Bostan, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taq_Kasra"] Taq-e-Kasra, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naqsh-e_Rustam"] Naqsh-e-Rostam, and the
 Shapur-Khwast Castle are among the surviving monuments from the Sasanian
period.

Museum of Art
During the Middle Ages, Sasanian art played a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asian medieval
art,[91] which carried forward to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_world"] Islamic world, and much of what later became known as Islamic learning—including
medicine, architecture, philosophy, philology, and literature—were of Sasanian basis.[428][429][430][431]
The Safavid era is known as the Golden Age of Iranian art,[432] and Safavid works of art show a far more unitary
 development than in any other period,[433] as part of a political evolution that reunified Iran as a cultural entity.[433] Safavid
art exerted noticeable influences upon the neighboring Ottomans, the Mughals, and the Deccans, and was also influential
through its fashion and garden architecture on 11th–17th-century Europe.[433]
Page 24
Iran's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_modern_and_contemporary_art"] contemporary art traces its origins back to the time of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamal-ol-molk"] Kamal-ol-Molk,[435] a
prominent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)"] realist painter at the court of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qajar_dynasty"] Qajar dynasty who affected the norms of
painting and adopted a naturalistic style that would compete with photographic
works. A new Iranian school of fine art was established by Kamal-ol-Molk in
1928,[435] and was followed by the so-called "coffeehouse" style of painting.
Iran's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avant-garde"] avant-garde modernists emerged by the arrival of new western influences
during World War II.[435] The vibrant contemporary art scene originates in the late
1940s, and Tehran's first modern art gallery, Apadana, was opened in September
1949 by painters Mahmud Javadipur, Hosein Kazemi, and Hushang
Ajudani.[436][437] The new movements received official encouragement by the mid-
1950s,[435] which led to the emergence of artists such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcos_Grigorian"] Marcos Grigorian,
signaling a commitment to the creation of a form of modern art grounded in
Iran.[438] 
 Kamal-ol-Molk's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_Hall"] Mirror Hall, often
 considered a starting point in Iranian
modern art[434]
Architecture
The history of architecture in Iran goes back to the seventh millennium BC.[439]
Iranians were among the first to use mathematics, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"] geometry and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy"] astronomy in
architecture. Iranian architecture displays great variety, both structural and aesthetic,

The guiding [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(visual_arts)"] motif of Iranian architecture is its cosmic symbolism, "by which man is
brought into communication and participation with the powers of heaven".[441]
Iran ranks seventh among [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO"] UNESCO's list of countries with the most archaeological
ruins and attractions from antiquity.[442]
Traditionally, the guiding formative motif of Iranian architecture has been its cosmic
 symbolism "by which man is brought into communication and participation with
the powers of heaven".[443] This theme has not only given unity and continuity to
the architecture of Persia but has been a primary source of its emotional character as
well.
According to Persian historian and archaeologist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Upham_Pope"] Arthur Pope, the supreme Iranian
art, in the proper meaning of the word, has always been its architecture. The
supremacy of architecture applies to both pre- and post-Islamic periods.[444]

Weaving
Iran's carpet-weaving has its origins in the Bronze Age and is one of the most
distinguished manifestations of Iranian art. Iran is the world's largest producer and
exporter of handmade carpets, producing three-quarters of the world's total output
and having a share of 30% of world's export markets.[445][446]

Literature
Iran's oldest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literature"] literary tradition is that of Avestan, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Iranian"] Old Iranian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_language"] sacred language of the Avesta, which consists of the
legendary and religious texts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism"] Zoroastrianism and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Iranian_religion"] ancient Iranian religion, with its earliest records dating back to the
pre-Achaemenid times.[447]
Of the various modern languages used in Iran, Persian, various dialects of which are spoken throughout the Iranian
Plateau,[448][449] has the most influential literature. Persian has been dubbed as a worthy language to serve as a conduit for
poetry, and is considered one of the four main bodies of world literature.[450] Despite originating from the region of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persis"] Persis
 (better known as Persia) in southwestern Iran, the Persian language was used and developed further through Persianate
societies in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia"] Asia Minor, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"] Central Asia, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"] South Asia, leaving massive influences on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_poetry"] Ottoman and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language_in_the_Indian_subcontinent"] Mughal literatures,
among others.

Iran has a number of famous medieval poets, most notably Rumi, Ferdowsi, Hafez,
 Sa'adi, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khayyam"] Omar Khayyam, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nizami_Ganjavi"] Nezami Ganjavi.[451] Iranian literature also inspired
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson"] writers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Henry David Thoreau, and Ralph
Waldo Emerson.[108][109][110]
Philosophy
Zoroaster, the founder of
Zoroastrianism, depicted on
 Raphael's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens"] The School of Athens 
 Iranian philosophy originates from Indo-
European roots, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroaster"] Zoroaster's reforms
having major influences. 
Tomb of the 10th-century Persian
poet Ferdowsi, author of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahnameh"] Šāhnāme,
 According to The Oxford Dictionary of
Philosophy, the chronology of the subject 
the classical Persian composition of
the Iranian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_epic"] national epics, in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tus,_Iran"] Tus
and science of philosophy starts with the
Indo-Iranians, dating this event to 1500 BC. The Oxford dictionary also states,
"Zarathushtra's philosophy entered to influence Western tradition through Judaism,
and therefore on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Platonism"] Middle Platonism."
While there are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-Iranian_religion"] ancient relations between the Indian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas"] Vedas and the Iranian Avesta,
the two main families of the Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences, especially
in their implications for the human being's position in society and their view of man's role in the universe.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_Cylinder"] Cyrus Cylinder, which is known as "the first charter of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights"] human rights", is often seen as a reflection of the questions and
thoughts expressed by Zoroaster, and developed in Zoroastrian schools of the Achaemenid era.[452][453] The earliest tenets
of Zoroastrian schools are part of the extant scriptures of the Zoroastrian religion in Avestan. Among them are treatises such
as the Zatspram, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikand-gumanig_Vizar"] Shkand-gumanik Vizar, and Denkard, as well as older passages of the Avesta and the Gathas.[454]
The current trends in Iranian philosophy have grown limited in scope because of Islamic frames of thought [455] although
the liberal ways of thought remain open to be generated in Iranian publications by Iranian intellectuals, especially outside
Iran, where the Iranian regime has less power to restrict Iranian thought and philosophy.
Mythology
 Iranian mythology consists of ancient [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_folklore"] Iranian folklore and stories, all involving extraordinary beings, reflecting attitudes
towards the confrontation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_and_evil"] good and evil, actions of the gods, and the exploits of heroes and fabulous creatures.
Myths play a crucial part in Iranian culture, and understanding of them is increased when they are considered within the
context of actual events in Iranian history. The geography of Greater Iran, a vast area covering present-day Iran, the
Caucasus, Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Central Asia, with its high mountain ranges, plays the main role in much of Iranian
mythology.
Tenth-century Persian poet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdowsi"] Ferdowsi's long [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry"] epic poem [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahnameh"] Šāhnāme ("Book of Kings"), which is for the most part based on
Xwadāynāmag, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Persian"] Middle Persian compilation of the history of Iranian kings and heroes from mythical times down to the
reign of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosrow_II"] Chosroes II,[456] is considered the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_epic"] national epic of Iran. It draws heavily on the stories and characters of the
Zoroastrian tradition, from the texts of the Avesta, the Denkard, and the Bundahishn.
Music
Iran is the apparent birthplace of the earliest complex instruments, dating back to the third millennium BC.[457] The use of
both vertical and horizontal angular [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harp"] harps have been documented at the sites Madaktu and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kul-e_Farah"] Kul-e Farah, with the largest
collection of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elam"] Elamite instruments documented at Kul-e Farah. Multiple depictions of horizontal harps were also sculpted in
Assyrian palaces, dating back between 865 and 650 BC.
 Xenophon's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyropaedia"] Cyropaedia mentions a great number of singing women at the court of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire"] Achaemenid Empire. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenaeus"] Athenaeus of
Naucratis, in his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deipnosophistae"] Deipnosophistae, points out to the capture of Achaemenid singing girls at the court of the last Achaemenid
king [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_III"] Darius III (336–330 BC) by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom)"] Macedonian general Parmenion. Under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire"] Parthian Empire, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gusans"] gōsān ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_language"] Parthian for

"minstrel") had a prominent role in the society.[458] According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutarch"] Plutarch's Life of
Crassus (32.3), they praised their national heroes and ridiculed their Roman rivals.
Likewise, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo"] Strabo's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographica"] Geographica reports that the Parthian youth were taught songs
about "the deeds both of the gods and of the noblest men".[459]
The history of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_music"] Sasanian music is better documented than the earlier periods and is
especially more evident in Avestan texts.[460] By the time of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosrow_II"] Chosroes II, the
Sasanian royal court hosted a number of prominent musicians, namely Azad,
Bamshad, Barbad, Nagisa, Ramtin, and Sarkash.
Iranian traditional musical instruments include string instruments such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang_(instrument)"] chang
(harp), qanun, santur, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rud"] rud (oud, barbat), tar, dotar, setar, tanbur, and kamanche,
wind instruments such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorna"] sorna (zurna, karna) and ney, and percussion instruments
such as tompak, kus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daf"] daf (dayere), and naqare. 
Karna, an ancient Iranian musical
instrument from the 6th century BC,
kept at the Persepolis Museum
Iran's first symphony orchestra, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran_Symphony_Orchestra"] Tehran Symphony Orchestra, was founded by Qolam-Hoseyn Minbashian in 1933. It
was reformed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parviz_Mahmoud"] Parviz Mahmoud in 1946, and is currently Iran's oldest and largest symphony orchestra. Later, by the late
1940s, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhollah_Khaleqi"] Ruhollah Khaleqi founded the country's first national music society, and established the School of National Music in
1949.[461]
 Iranian pop music has its origins in the Qajar era.[462] It was significantly developed since the 1950s, using indigenous
instruments and forms accompanied by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_guitar"] electric guitar and other imported characteristics. The emergence of genres such as
 rock in the 1960s and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_hip_hop"] hip hop in the 2000s also resulted in major movements and influences in Iranian
music.[463][464][465][466]
Theater
The earliest recorded representations of dancing figures within Iran were found in
prehistoric sites such as Tepe Sialk and Tepe Mūsīān.[467] The oldest Iranian
initiation of theater and the phenomena of acting can be traced in the ancient epic
ceremonial theaters such as Sug-e Siāvuš ("mourning of Siāvaš"), as well as dances
and theater narrations of Iranian mythological tales reported by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus"] Herodotus and
Xenophon.
Iran's traditional theatrical genres include Baqqāl-bāzi ("grocer play", a form of
slapstick comedy), Ruhowzi (or Taxt-howzi, comedy performed over a courtyard
pool covered with boards), Siāh-bāzi (in which the central comedian appears in
blackface), Sāye-bāzi ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_play"] shadow play), Xeyme-šab-bāzi (marionette), and Arusak-
bāzi (puppetry), and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta%27zieh"] Ta'zie (religious tragedy plays).[468] 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roudaki_Hall"] Roudaki Hall, constructed

artists and troupes,[469] with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roudaki_Hall"] Roudaki Hall of Tehran constructed to function as the national stage for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera"] opera and ballet.
Opened on 26 October 1967, the hall is home to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran_Symphony_Orchestra"] Tehran Symphony Orchestra, the Tehran Opera Orchestra, and the
 Iranian National Ballet Company, and was officially renamed Vahdat Hall after the 1979 Revolution.
 Loris Tjeknavorian's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostam_and_Sohrab_(opera)"] Rostam and Sohrab,  based on the tragedy of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rostam_and_Sohrab"] Rostam and Sohrab from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdowsi"] Ferdowsi's epic poem
 Šāhnāme, is an example of opera with Persian libretto. Tjeknavorian, a celebrated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Armenians"] Iranian Armenian composer and
 conductor, composed it in 25 years, and it was finally performed for the first time at Tehran's Roudaki Hall, with Darya
Dadvar in the role of Tahmina.
Cinema and animation
A third-millennium BC earthen goblet discovered at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahr-e_Sukhteh"] Burnt City, a Bronze Age urban settlement in southeastern Iran,
depicts what could possibly be the world's oldest example of animation. The artifact, associated with Jiroft, bears five
sequential images depicting a wild goat jumping up to eat the leaves of a tree.[471][472] The earliest attested Iranian
examples of visual representations, however, are traced back to the bas-reliefs of Persepolis, the ritual center of the
 Achaemenid Empire. The figures at Persepolis remain bound by the rules of grammar and syntax of visual language.[473]
The Iranian visual arts reached a pinnacle by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire"] Sasanian era, and several works from this period have been found to
Page 27
articulate movements and actions in a highly sophisticated manner. It is even
possible to see a progenitor of the cinematic close-up shot in one of these works of
art, which shows a wounded wild pig escaping from the hunting ground.[474] 
Reproduction of the 3rd-millennium
By the early 20th century, the five-year-old industry of cinema came to Iran. The
first Iranian filmmaker was probably [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Ebrahim_Khan_Akkas_Bashi"] Mirza Ebrahim (Akkas Bashi),  the court
photographer of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozaffar_ad-Din_Shah_Qajar"] Mozaffar-ed-Din Shah of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qajar_dynasty"] Qajar dynasty. Mirza Ebrahim 
BC goblet from southeastern Iran,

 obtained a camera and filmed the Qajar ruler's visit to Europe. Later in 1904, Mirza
Ebrahim (Sahhaf Bashi), a businessman, opened the first public movie theater in
Tehran.[475] After him, several others like Russi Khan, Ardeshir Khan, and Ali Vakili tried
to establish new movie theaters in Tehran. Until the early 1930s, there were around 15
 cinema theaters in Tehran and 11 in other provinces.[474] The first Iranian feature film, Abi
and Rabi, was a silent comedy directed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovanes_Ohanian"] Ovanes Ohanian in 1930. The first sounded one,
 Lor Girl, was produced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardeshir_Irani"] Ardeshir Irani and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdolhossein_Sepanta"] Abd-ol-Hosein Sepanta in 1932.
Iran's animation industry began by the 1950s, and was followed by the establishment of the
influential [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_the_Intellectual_Development_of_Children_and_Young_Adults"] Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children and Young Adults in
January 1965.[476][477] The 1960s was a significant decade for Iranian cinema, with 25
commercial films produced annually on average throughout the early 60s, increasing to 65 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbas_Kiarostami"] Abbas Kiarostami (1940–
by the end of the decade. The majority of the production focused on melodrama and 2016), an acclaimed Iranian
thrillers. With the screening of the films [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qeysar_(film)"] Qeysar and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cow_(1969_film)"] The Cow, directed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoud_Kimiai"] Masoud Kimiai film director
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dariush_Mehrjui"] Dariush Mehrjui respectively in 1969, alternative films set out to establish their status in
 the film industry and Bahram Beyzai's Downpour and Nasser Taghvai's Tranquility in the
Presence of Others followed soon. Attempts to organize a film festival, which had begun in 1954 within the framework of
the Golrizan Festival, resulted in the festival of Sepas in 1969. The endeavors also resulted in the formation of the Tehran's
World Film Festival in 1973.[478]
After the Revolution of 1979, and following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Cultural_Revolution"] Cultural Revolution, a new age emerged in
Iranian cinema, starting with Long Live! by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khosrow_Sinai"] Khosrow Sinai and followed by many other
directors, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbas_Kiarostami"] Abbas Kiarostami and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jafar_Panahi"] Jafar Panahi. Kiarostami, an acclaimed Iranian
director, planted Iran firmly on the map of world cinema when he won the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or"] Palme d'Or for
 Taste of Cherry in 1997.[479] The continuous presence of Iranian films in prestigious
international festivals, such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival"] Cannes Film Festival, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival"] Venice Film Festival, and the
 Berlin International Film Festival, attracted world attention to Iranian masterpieces.[480] In
2006, six Iranian films, of six different styles, represented Iranian cinema at the Berlin
International Film Festival. Critics considered this a remarkable event in the history of
Iranian cinema.[481][482]
 Asghar Farhadi, a well-known Iranian director, has received a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award"] Golden Globe Award and
two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award"] Academy Awards, representing Iran for Best Foreign Language Film in 2012 and

Cuisine
Due to its variety of ethnic groups and the influences from the neighboring cultures,
the cuisine of Iran is diverse. Herbs, along with fruits such as plums, pomegranate,
quince, prunes, apricots, and raisins, are frequently used. To achieve a balanced taste,
characteristic flavorings such as saffron, dried lime, cinnamon, and parsley are mixed
delicately and used in some special dishes. Onion and garlic are commonly used in
the preparation of the accompanying course, but are also served separately during
meals, either in raw or pickled form.
Iranian cuisine includes a wide range of main dishes, including various types of
kebab, pilaf, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stew"] stew (khoresh), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup"] soup and āsh, and omelette. Lunch and dinner meals are
commonly accompanied by side dishes such as plain [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogurt"] yogurt or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzatziki"] mast-o-khiar, sabzi,
 salad Shirazi, and torshi, and might follow dishes such as borani, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Ghassemi"] Mirza Qasemi, or
 kashk e bademjan as the appetizer. 
 Chelow kabab (rice and kebab), one
 of Iran's national
dishes[511][512][513]
In Iranian culture, tea (čāy) is widely consumed.[514][515] Iran is the world's seventh major tea producer,[516] and a cup of
tea is typically the first thing offered to a guest.[517] One of Iran's most popular desserts is the falude,[518] consisting of
 vermicelli in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_water"] rose water syrup, which has its roots in the fourth century BC.[519][520] There is also the popular saffron ice
cream, known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastani_Sonnati"] bastani sonnati ("traditional ice cream"),[521] which is sometimes accompanied with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot_juice"] carrot juice.[522] Iran
is also famous for its caviar.[523]

climbing,[527] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountaineering"] mountain climbing.[528][529] It is home to several ski resorts, the
most famous being Tochal, Dizin, and Shemshak, all within one to three hours
traveling from the capital city Tehran.[530] The resort of Tochal, located in the
 Alborz mountain rage, is the world's fifth-highest ski resort (3,730 m or 12,238 ft at
its highest station).
Iran's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Olympic_Committee_of_the_Islamic_Republic_of_Iran"] National Olympic Committee was founded in 1947. Wrestlers and
 weightlifters have achieved the country's highest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_at_the_Olympics"] records at the Olympics. In

to enter a country where they would be forced to wear a hijab.
Media
 Iran is one of the countries with the worst freedom of the press situation, ranking 174th out of 180 countries on the Press
Freedom Index (as of 2021).[538][539] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Culture_and_Islamic_Guidance"] Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance is Iran's main government department
responsible for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_policy"] cultural policy, including activities regarding communications and information.[540]
Iran's first newspapers were published during the reign of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naser_al-Din_Shah_Qajar"] Naser al-Din Shah of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qajar_dynasty"] Qajar dynasty in the mid-19th
century.[541] Most of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_Iran"] newspapers published in Iran are in Persian, the country's official language. The country's most
widely circulated periodicals are based in Tehran, among which are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etemad"] Etemad, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettela%27at"] Ettela'at, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayhan"] Kayhan, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamshahri"] Hamshahri, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resalat_(newspaper)"] Resalat, and

Television was introduced in Iran in 1958.[542] Although the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Asian_Games"] 1974 Asian Games were broadcast in color, full color
 programming began in 1978.[542] Since the 1979 Revolution, Iran's largest media corporation is the Islamic Republic of
Iran Broadcasting (IRIB).[329] Despite the restrictions on non-domestic television, about 65% of the residents of the capital
 city and about 30 to 40% of the residents outside the capital city access worldwide television channels through satellite
dishes, although observers state that the figures are likely to be higher.[543][544]
Iran received access to the Internet in 1993. According to Internet World Stats, as of 2017, around 69.1% of the population
of Iran are Internet users.[545] Iran ranks 17th among [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users"] countries by number of Internet users. According to the statistics
provided by the web information company of Alexa, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search"] Google Search is Iran's most widely used search engine and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram"] Instagram
is the most popular online [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking_service"] social networking service.[546] Direct access to many worldwide mainstream websites has been
blocked in Iran, including Facebook, which has been blocked since 2009 due to the organization of anti-governmental
protests on the website.[547] However, as of 2017, Facebook has around 40 million subscribers based in Iran (48.8% of the
population) who use [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network"] virtual private networks and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server"] proxy servers to access the website.[545] Some of the officials themselves
have verified accounts on the social networking websites that are blocked by the authorities, including Facebook and
Twitter.[548] About 90% of Iran's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce"] e-commerce takes place on the Iranian online store of Digikala, which has around
 750,000 visitors per day and more than 2.3 million subscribers and is the most visited online store in the Middle
East.[549][546]
Fashion and clothing
 Fashion in Iran is divided into several historical periods. The exact date of the emergence of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving"] weaving in Iran is not yet
known, but it is likely to coincide with the emergence of civilization. Clothing in Iran is mentioned in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_mythology"] Persian mythology.
 Ferdowsi and many historians have considered [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyumars"] Keyumars to be the inventor of the use of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_skin"] animals' skin and hair as clothing.
Some historians have also mentioned [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hushang"] Hushang as the first inventor of the use of living skins as clothing.[550] Ferdowsi
considers [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahmuras"] Tahmuras to be a kind of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile"] textile initiator in Iran. There are historical discoveries in northern Iran from about 6,000
BC that refer to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wool"] wool weaving at the time. Other discoveries in central Iran dating back to 4200 BC have shown that the
animals' skin has not been the only clothing worn on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Plateau"] Iranian Plateau since those years. The clothing of ancient Iran took
an advanced form, and the fabric and color of clothing became very important at that time. Depending on the social status,
eminence, climate of the region and the season, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_clothing"] Persian clothing during the Achaemenian period took various forms. The
philosophy used in this clothing, in addition to being functional, also had an aesthetic role.[550]
 Beauty pageant festivals inside Iran were not held after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_revolution"] 1979 revolution, and the last selection ceremony of the "beauty
queen of Iran" was held in 1978 in this country. Since then, many Iranian girls have participated in the Beauty pageant and
Miss Universe outside of Iran. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahar_Biniaz"] Sahar Biniaz ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Universe_Canada_2012"] Miss Universe Canada 2012) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shermine_Shahrivar"] Shermineh Shahrivar ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Germany"] Miss Germany and
 Miss Europe) are examples of Iranian models outside Iran.[551][552] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls_of_Enghelab_Street"] Girls of Enghelab Street was a series of protests in
2017–2019 against a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab_by_country#Iran"] compulsory hijab in Iran.[553]

b. In the Avesta, the airiia- are members of the ethnic group of the Avesta-reciters themselves, in
contradistinction to the anairiia- (the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneran"] non-Arya"). The word also appears four times in Old Persian: One is
in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behistun_Inscription"] Behistun Inscription, where ariya- is the name of a language (DB 4.89). The other three instances
occur in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_the_Great"] Darius the Great's inscription at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naqsh-e_Rostam"] Naqsh-e Rostam (DNa 14–15), in Darius I's inscription at Susa
(DSe 13–14), and in the inscription of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I"] Xerxes I at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis"] Persepolis (XPh 12–13). In these, the two Achaemenid
dynasties describe themselves as pārsa pārsahyā puça ariya ariyaciça "a Persian, son of a Persian, an
Ariya, of Ariya origin."—The phrase with ciça ("origin, descendance") assures that ariya is an ethnic name
wider in meaning than pārsa and not a simple adjectival epithet.[39]

Islamic Republic of Iran holds elections regularly, but they fall short of democratic standards due to the role
of the hard-line Guardian Council, which disqualifies all candidates deemed insufficiently loyal to the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei"] clerical establishment. Ultimate power rests in the hands of the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, and the unelected institutions under his control. Human rights abuses continued unabated in
2016, with the authorities carrying out Iran's largest mass execution in years and launching a renewed
crackdown on women's rights activists. The regime maintained restrictions on freedom of expression, both
offline and online, and made further arrests of journalists, bloggers, labor union activists, and dual nationals
visiting the country, with some facing heavy prison sentences. Hard-liners controlling powerful institutions,
including the judiciary and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), were behind many of the year's
abuses. There were no indications that President Hassan Rouhani, a self-proclaimed moderate seeking
reelection in 2017, was willing or able to push back against repressive forces and deliver the greater social
freedoms he had promised. Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi, his wife Zahra Rahnavard, and
reformist cleric Mehdi Karroubi remained under house arrest for a sixth year without being formally charged
or put on trial. As in 2015, the media were barred from quoting or reporting on former president Mohammad
Khatami, another important reformist figure."
