 Kazakhstan,[d] officially the Republic of Kazakhstan,[e] is a transcontinental landlocked
country located mainly in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"] Central Asia and partly in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe"] Eastern Europe.[f] It borders [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"] Russia to
 the north and west, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"] China to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93Kazakhstan_border"] the east, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyzstan"] Kyrgyzstan to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan%E2%80%93Kyrgyzstan_border"] the southeast, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistan"] Uzbekistan to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan%E2%80%93Uzbekistan_border"] the south,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmenistan"] Turkmenistan to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan%E2%80%93Turkmenistan_border"] the southwest. Its capital is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nur-Sultan"] Nur-Sultan, formerly known as Astana
until 2019. Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, was the country's capital until 1997.
 Kazakhstan is the world's largest landlocked country, the world's largest Muslim-majority
country by land area (and the northernmost), and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area"] ninth-largest country in the world
overall. It has a population of 19 million people, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population_density"] one of the lowest population densities
in the world, at fewer than 6 people per square kilometre (15 people per square mile).
The country dominates Central Asia economically and politically, generating 60 percent of
the region's GDP, primarily through its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry"] oil and gas industry; it also has vast mineral
resources.[12] Officially, it is a democratic, secular, unitary, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic"] constitutional republic with a
 diverse cultural heritage.[13] Kazakhstan is a member state of the United Nations, the World
 Trade Organization, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Shanghai Cooperation
Organisation, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Economic_Union"] Eurasian Economic Union, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_Security_Treaty_Organization"] Collective Security Treaty Organization,
 the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Organization of Islamic

Culture.
The territory of Kazakhstan has historically been inhabited by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad"] nomadic groups and empires.
 In antiquity, the ancient Iranian nomadic Scythians inhabited the land, and the Achaemenid
Persian Empire expanded towards the southern territory of the modern country. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples"] Turkic
nomads, who trace their ancestry to many [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Turkic_dynasties_and_countries"] Turkic states such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Turkic_Khaganate"] First Turkic Khaganate
and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Turkic_Khaganate"] Second Turkic Khaganate, have inhabited the country from as early as the 6th
century. In the 13th century, the territory was subjugated by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire"] Mongol Empire under
 Genghis Khan. In the 15th century, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_Khanate"] Kazakh Khanate conquered much land that would
later form the territory of modern Kazakhstan.
By the 16th century, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhs"] Kazakhs emerged as a distinct Turkic group, divided into three [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuz"] jüz.
They raided the territory of Russia throughout the 18th century, causing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians"] Russians to
advance into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_Steppe"] Kazakh Steppe; by the mid-19th century, the Russians nominally ruled all
of Kazakhstan as part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire"] Russian Empire and liberated all of the slaves that the Kazakhs
had captured in 1859.[14] Following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution"] 1917 Russian Revolution and subsequent outbreak
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War"] Russian Civil War, the territory of Kazakhstan was reorganized several times. In
1936, it was established as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_Soviet_Socialist_Republic"] Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic within the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"] Soviet Union.
Kazakhstan was the last of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union"] Soviet republics to declare independence during the
 dissolution of the Soviet Union from 1988 to 1991. Human rights organizations have
 described the Kazakh government as authoritarian, and regularly describe Kazakhstan's
human rights situation as poor.

Etymology
The name "Kazakh" comes from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Turkic_language"] ancient Turkic word qaz, "to wander", reflecting the
Kazakhs' [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_nomads"] nomadic culture.[15] The term "Cossack" is of the same origin.[15] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_language"] Persian
suffix [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-stan"] -stan means "land" or "place of", so Kazakhstan can be literally translated as "land of
the wanderers".
Though the term traditionally referred only to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhs"] ethnic Kazakhs, including those living in
China, Russia, Turkey, Uzbekistan and other neighbouring countries, the term Kazakh is
increasingly being used to refer to any inhabitant of Kazakhstan, including non-
Kazakhs.[16]
History
Kazakhstan has been inhabited since the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic"] Paleolithic era.[17] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoralism"] Pastoralism developed during
the Neolithic, as the region's climate and terrain are best suited to a nomadic lifestyle.

Approximate extent of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythia"] Scythia in the
1st century BC 
The Kazakh territory was a key constituent of the Eurasian trading [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe_Route"] Steppe Route, the ancestor of the
terrestrial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_UNESCO_World_Heritage_Sites"] Silk Roads. Archaeologists believe that humans first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication_of_the_horse"] domesticated the horse (i.e., ponies) in
the region's vast steppes. During recent prehistoric times, Central Asia was inhabited by groups such
as the possibly Indo-European [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afanasievo_culture"] Afanasievo culture,[18] later early Indo-Iranian cultures such as
Andronovo,[19] and later Indo-Iranians such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saka"] Saka and Massagetae.[20][21] Other groups
included the nomadic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythians"] Scythians and the Persian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire"] Achaemenid Empire in the southern territory of the
 modern country. In 329 BC, Alexander the Great and his Macedonian army fought in the Battle of
Jaxartes against the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythians"] Scythians along the Jaxartes River, now known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syr_Darya"] Syr Darya along the
southern border of modern Kazakhstan.
Cuman-Kipchak and Golden Horde
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuman_people"] Cumans entered the steppes of modern-day Kazakhstan around the early 11th century, where
they later joined with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kipchak_people"] Kipchak and established the vast Cuman-Kipchak confederation. While
ancient cities [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taraz"] Taraz (Aulie-Ata) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazrat-e_Turkestan"] Hazrat-e Turkestan had long served as important way-stations
along the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road"] Silk Road connecting Asia and Europe, true political consolidation began only with the
Mongol rule of the early 13th century. Under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire"] Mongol Empire, the first strictly structured
administrative districts (Ulus) were established. After the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_the_Mongol_Empire"] Division of the Mongol Empire in 1259, the
land that would become modern-day Kazakhstan was ruled by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horde"] Golden Horde, also known as the
Ulus of Jochi. During the Golden Horde period, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turco-Mongol_tradition"] Turco-Mongol tradition emerged among the ruling
elite wherein [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Turkicised&action=edit&redlink=1"] Turkicised descendants of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan"] Genghis Khan followed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"] Islam and continued to reign over

Kazakh Khanate
In 1465, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_Khanate"] Kazakh Khanate emerged as a result of dissolution of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horde"] Golden Horde. Established by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janibek_Khan"] Janibek Khan and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerei_Khan"] Kerei Khan, it
continued to be ruled by to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turco-Mongol_tradition"] Turco-Mongol clan of Tore ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jochi"] Jochid dynasty).
Throughout this period, traditional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad"] nomadic life and a livestock-based economy continued to dominate the steppe. In the 15th century, a
distinct [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhs"] Kazakh identity began to emerge among the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples"] Turkic tribes. This was followed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_War_of_Independence"] Kazakh War of Independence where the
khanate gained its sovereignty from the Shaybanids. The process was consolidated by the mid-16th century with the appearance of the
 Kazakh language, culture, and economy. 
Nevertheless, the region was the focus of ever-increasing disputes between the native Kazakh
 emirs and the neighbouring [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian-speaking_peoples"] Persian-speaking peoples to the south. At its height, the Khanate
would rule parts of Central Asia and control Cumania. The Kazakh khanate's territories would
expanding deep into Central Asia. By the early 17th century, the Kazakh Khanate was
struggling with the impact of tribal rivalries, which had effectively divided the population into
the Great, Middle and Little (or Small) hordes ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCz"] jüz). Political disunion, tribal rivalries, and the
diminishing importance of overland trade routes between east and west weakened the Kazakh
Khanate. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khiva_Khanate"] Khiva Khanate used this opportunity and annexed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangyshlak_Peninsula"] Mangyshlak Peninsula. Uzbek rule

During the 17th century, the Kazakhs fought Oirats, a federation of western [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol"] Mongol tribes,
including the Dzungar.[22] The beginning of the 18th century marked the zenith of the Kazakh
 Khanate. During this period the Little Horde participated in the 1723–1730 war against the
Dzungar Khanate, following their "Great Disaster" [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion"] invasion of Kazakh territories. Under the
leadership of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abul_Khair_Khan"] Abul Khair Khan, the Kazakhs won major victories over the Dzungar at the Bulanty River in 1726, and at the Battle of
Anrakay in 1729.[23]
 Ablai Khan participated in the most significant battles against the Dzungar from the 1720s to the 1750s, for which he was declared a "batyr"
("hero") by the people. The Kazakhs suffered from the frequent raids against them by the Volga Kalmyks. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokand_Khanate"] Kokand Khanate used the
weakness of Kazakh jüzs after Dzungar and Kalmyk raids and conquered present Southeastern Kazakhstan, including Almaty, the formal
capital in the first quarter of the 19th century. Also, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Bukhara"] Emirate of Bukhara ruled [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shymkent"] Shymkent before the Russians gained dominance.[24]
Russian Kazakhstan
In the first half of the 18th century, the Russian Empire constructed the Irtysh line, a series of forty-six forts and ninety-six redoubts,
including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omsk"] Omsk (1716), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semey"] Semipalatinsk (1718), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlodar"] Pavlodar (1720), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orenburg"] Orenburg (1743) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petropavl"] Petropavlovsk (1752),[25] to prevent Kazakh and
Oirat raids into Russian territory.[26] In the late 18th century the Kazakhs took advantage of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugachev%27s_Rebellion"] Pugachev's Rebellion, which was centred on the
Volga area, to raid Russian and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_Germans"] Volga German settlements.[27] In the 19th century, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire"] Russian Empire began to expand its influence into
 Central Asia. The "Great Game" period is generally regarded as running from approximately 1813 to the Anglo-Russian Convention of
1907. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar"] tsars effectively ruled over most of the territory belonging to what is now the Republic of Kazakhstan.
Page 4
The Russian Empire introduced a system of administration and built military garrisons and barracks
in its effort to establish a presence in Central Asia in the so-called "Great Game" for dominance in
the area against the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire"] British Empire, which was extending its influence from the south in India and
Southeast Asia. Russia built its first outpost, Orsk, in 1735. Russia introduced the Russian language
in all schools and governmental organisations.
Russian efforts to impose its system aroused the resentment by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_people"] Kazakh people, and, by the
1860s, some Kazakhs resisted Russia's rule. It had disrupted the traditional nomadic lifestyle and
livestock-based economy, and people were suffering from hunger and starvation, with some Kazakh
tribes being decimated. The Kazakh national movement, which began in the late 19th century, sought
to preserve the native language and identity by resisting the attempts of the Russian Empire to
assimilate and stifle them.

 Kazakhs (the Russians originally
called the Kazakhs "Kirgiz")
From the 1890s onward, ever-larger numbers of settlers from the Russian Empire began [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonising"] colonising
the territory of present-day Kazakhstan, in particular, the province of Semirechye. The number of
settlers rose still further once the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Aral_Railway"] Trans-Aral Railway from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orenburg"] Orenburg to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashkent"] Tashkent was completed in
1906. A specially created Migration Department (Переселенческое Управление) in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg"] St. Petersburg
oversaw and encouraged the migration to expand Russian influence in the area. During the 19th
century about 400,000 Russians immigrated to Kazakhstan, and about one million Slavs, Germans,
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasile_Balabanov"] Jews, and others immigrated to the region during the first third of the 20th century.[28] Vasile
Balabanov was the administrator responsible for the resettlement during much of this time. 
Map of the Kazakh Territory in 1903
The competition for land and water that ensued between the Kazakhs and the newcomers caused great resentment against colonial rule
during the final years of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire"] Russian Empire. The most serious uprising, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asian_Revolt"] Central Asian Revolt, occurred in 1916. The Kazakhs attacked
Russian and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cossack"] Cossack settlers and military garrisons. The revolt resulted in a series of clashes and in brutal massacres committed by both
sides.[29] Both sides resisted the communist government until late 1919.
Kazakh SSR
Following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution"] collapse of central government in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Petersburg"] Petrograd in November 1917, the Kazakhs (then in
 Russia officially referred to as "Kirghiz") experienced a brief period of autonomy (the Alash
 Autonomy) before eventually succumbing to the Bolsheviks′ rule. On 26 August 1920, the Kirghiz
Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic within the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic"] Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic
(RSFSR) was established. The Kirghiz ASSR included the territory of present-day Kazakhstan, but
its administrative centre was the mainly Russian-populated town of Orenburg. In June 1925, the
Kirghiz ASSR was renamed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_Autonomous_Soviet_Socialist_Republic"] Kazak ASSR and its administrative centre was transferred to the
town of Kyzylorda, and in April 1927 to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almaty"] Alma-Ata.
Soviet repression of the traditional elite, along with forced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivisation"] collectivisation in the late 1920s and
 1930s, brought famine and high fatalities, leading to unrest (see also: Famine in Kazakhstan of 1932–
33).[30][31] During the 1930s, some members of the Kazakh intelligentsia were executed – as part of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression_in_the_Soviet_Union"] policies of political reprisals pursued by the Soviet government in Moscow. 
Stanitsa Sofiiskaya, Talgar. 1920s
On 5 December 1936, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_Autonomous_Soviet_Socialist_Republic"] Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (whose territory by then
 corresponded to that of modern Kazakhstan) was detached from the Russian Soviet Federative
Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and made the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_Soviet_Socialist_Republic"] Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, a full [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republics_of_the_Soviet_Union"] union republic of
the USSR, one of eleven such republics at the time, along with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirghiz_Soviet_Socialist_Republic"] Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic.
The republic was one of the destinations for exiled and convicted persons, as well as for mass
resettlements, or deportations affected by the central USSR authorities during the 1930s and 1940s, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Pioneer_organization_of_the_Soviet_Union"] Young Pioneers at a Young Pioneer

Deportees and prisoners were interned in some of the biggest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag"] Soviet labour camps (the Gulag),

The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)"] Soviet-German War (1941–1945) led to an increase in industrialisation and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_extraction"] mineral extraction in support of the war effort. At the time of
 Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, however, Kazakhstan still had an overwhelmingly agricultural economy. In 1953, Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev initiated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Lands_Campaign"] Virgin Lands Campaign designed to turn the traditional pasturelands of Kazakhstan into a major grain-producing
region for the Soviet Union. The Virgin Lands policy brought mixed results. However, along with later modernisations under Soviet leader
 Leonid Brezhnev (in power 1964–1982), it accelerated the development of the agricultural sector, which remains the source of livelihood for
a large percentage of Kazakhstan's population. Because of the decades of privation, war and resettlement, by 1959 the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhs"] Kazakhs had become
a minority in the country, making up 30% of the population. Ethnic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians"] Russians accounted for 43%.[33]
In 1947, the USSR government, as part of its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_atomic_bomb_project"] atomic bomb project, founded an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semipalatinsk_Test_Site"] atomic bomb test site near the north-eastern town of
Semipalatinsk, where the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDS-1"] first Soviet nuclear bomb test was conducted in 1949. Hundreds of nuclear tests were conducted until 1989 with
adverse consequences for the nation's environment and population.[34] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nuclear_movement_in_Kazakhstan"] Anti-nuclear movement in Kazakhstan became a major political

In December 1986, mass demonstrations by young ethnic Kazakhs, later called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeltoqsan"] Jeltoqsan riot,
took place in Almaty to protest the replacement of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary"] First Secretary of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Kazakhstan"] Communist Party of the

troops suppressed the unrest, several people were killed, and many demonstrators were jailed.[35] In
the waning days of Soviet rule, discontent continued to grow and found expression under Soviet

Independence 
The International Conference on
Primary Health Care in 1978, known
On 25 October 1990, Kazakhstan declared its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty"] sovereignty on its territory as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alma_Ata_Declaration"] Alma-Ata Declaration
as a republic within the Soviet Union. Following the August 1991
aborted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_Soviet_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt"] coup attempt in Moscow, Kazakhstan declared [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstani_Independence_Day"] independence on
16 December 1991, thus becoming the last Soviet republic to declare independence. Ten days later, the Soviet
Union itself [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union"] ceased to exist.
Kazakhstan's communist-era leader, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev"] Nursultan Nazarbayev, became the country's first President. Nazarbayev
ruled in an authoritarian manner. An emphasis was placed on converting the country's economy to a market
economy while political reforms lagged behind economic advances. By 2006, Kazakhstan was generating 60%
of the GDP of Central Asia, primarily through its oil industry.[12]

Independence, Republic 
In 1997, the government moved the capital to Astana, renamed Nur-Sultan on 23 March 2019,[36] from Almaty,
Kazakhstan's largest city, where it had been established under the Soviet Union.[37]
Square, Almaty  In March 2019, Nazarbayev resigned 29 years after taking office. However, he continued to lead the influential
security council and held the formal title Leader of the Nation.[38] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassym-Jomart_Tokayev"] Kassym-Jomart Tokayev succeeded
Nazarbayev as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Kazakhstan"] President of Kazakhstan. His first official act was to rename the capital after his
predecessor.[39] In June 2019, the new president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, won Kazakhstan's presidential election.[40]
In January 2022, the country plunged into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Kazakhstan_unrest"] political unrest following a spike in fuel prices.[41] In consequence, President Kassym-Jomart
Tokayev took over as head of the powerful Security Council, removing his predecessor Nursultan Nazarbayev from the post.[42]
Geography
As it extends across both sides of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ural_River"] Ural River, considered the dividing line separating Europe and
 Asia, Kazakhstan is one of only two landlocked countries in the world that has territory in two
continents (the other is Azerbaijan).
With an area of 2,700,000 square kilometres (1,000,000 sq mi) – equivalent in size to Western
Europe – Kazakhstan is the ninth-largest country and largest landlocked country in the world. While
it was part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire"] Russian Empire, Kazakhstan lost some of its territory to China's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang"] Xinjiang
province,[43] and some to Uzbekistan's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karakalpakstan"] Karakalpakstan autonomous republic during Soviet years.
It shares borders of 6,846 kilometres (4,254 mi) with Russia, 2,203 kilometres (1,369 mi) with
Uzbekistan, 1,533 kilometres (953 mi) with China, 1,051 kilometres (653 mi) with Kyrgyzstan, and
379 kilometres (235 mi) with Turkmenistan. Major cities include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nur-Sultan"] Nur-Sultan, Almaty, Karagandy,
Shymkent, Atyrau, and Oskemen. It lies between latitudes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40th_parallel_north"] 40° and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/56th_parallel_north"] 56° N, and longitudes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/46th_meridian_east"] 46° and
 88° E. While located primarily in Asia, a small portion of Kazakhstan is also located west of the
 Urals in Eastern Europe.[44]

Natural resources
Kazakhstan has an abundant supply of accessible mineral and fossil fuel resources. Development of
petroleum, natural gas, and mineral extractions has attracted most of the over $40 billion in foreign
investment in Kazakhstan since 1993 and accounts for some 57% of the nation's industrial output (or
approximately 13% of gross domestic product). According to some estimates,[46] Kazakhstan has the
second largest uranium, chromium, lead, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"] zinc reserves; the third largest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese"] manganese reserves; the
fifth largest copper reserves; and ranks in the top ten for coal, iron, and gold. It is also an exporter of
diamonds. Perhaps most significant for economic development, Kazakhstan also has the 11th largest
proven reserves of both petroleum and natural gas.[47]
In total, there are 160 deposits with over 2.7 billion tonnes (2.7 billion long tons) of petroleum. Oil [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaganda_Region"] Karaganda Region
explorations have shown that the deposits on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_sea"] Caspian shore are only a small part of a much larger
deposit. It is said that 3.5 billion tonnes (3.4 billion long tons) of oil and 2.5 billion cubic metres (88 billion cubic feet) of gas could be found
in that area. Overall the estimate of Kazakhstan's oil deposits is 6.1 billion tonnes (6.0 billion long tons). However, there are only three
 refineries within the country, situated in Atyrau,[48] Pavlodar, and Shymkent. These are not capable of processing the total crude output, so
much of it is exported to Russia. According to the US [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Information_Administration"] Energy Information Administration Kazakhstan was producing approximately
1,540,000 barrels (245,000 m3) of oil per day in 2009.[49]
Kazakhstan also possesses large deposits of phosphorite. Two of the largest deposits include the Karatau basin with 650 million tonnes of
P2O5 and the Chilisai deposit of the [URL: "https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%90%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%B1%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BD"] Aqtobe phosphorite basin located in northwestern Kazakhstan, with resources of 500–800 million

On 17 October 2013, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extractive_Industries_Transparency_Initiative"] Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) accepted Kazakhstan as "EITI Compliant", meaning that the
country has a basic and functional process to ensure the regular disclosure of natural resource revenues.[52]
Climate
Kazakhstan has an "extreme" [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_climate"] continental climate, with hot summers and very cold winters. Indeed,
Nursultan is the second coldest capital city in the world after Ulaanbaatar. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)"] Precipitation varies
between arid and semi-arid conditions, the winter being particularly dry.[53]

Political system
Page 7
 Officially, Kazakhstan is a democratic, secular, constitutional unitary republic; Nursultan
 Nazarbayev led the country from 1991 to 2019.[59][60] He was succeeded by Kassym-
Jomart Tokayev.[61][62] The president may veto legislation that has been passed by the
 parliament and is also the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_in_chief"] commander in chief of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_the_Republic_of_Kazakhstan"] armed forces. The prime minister
chairs the cabinet of ministers and serves as Kazakhstan's head of government. There
are three deputy prime ministers and sixteen ministers in the cabinet.[63]
Kazakhstan has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameral"] bicameral parliament composed of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majilis"] Majilis (the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house"] lower house) and
 senate (the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house"] upper house).[64] Single-mandate districts popularly elect 107 seats in the
Majilis; there also are ten members elected by party-list vote. The senate has 48
members. Two senators are selected by each of the elected assemblies (mäslihats) of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassym-Jomart_Tokayev"] Kassym-Jomart Tokayev [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alihan_Smaiylov"] Alihan Smaiylov

of Nur-Sultan, Almaty, and Shymkent). The president appoints the remaining fifteen
senators. Majilis deputies and the government both have the right of legislative initiative, though the government proposes most legislation
considered by the parliament.
In 2020, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_House"] Freedom House rated Kazakhstan as a "consolidated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian"] authoritarian regime", stating that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech"] freedom of speech is not respected and
"Kazakhstan’s electoral laws do not provide for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_fair_election"] free and fair elections."[65]
Political reforms
Reforms have begun to be implemented after the election of Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in June 2019. Tokayev supports a culture of
opposition, public assembly, and loosening rules on forming political parties.[66] In June 2019, on the initiative of the President of
Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev the National Council of Public Trust have been established as a platform in which wider society can
discuss different views and strengthen the national conversation regarding government policies and reforms.[67] In July 2019, the President
of Kazakhstan announced a concept of a ‘listening state’ that quickly and efficiently responds to all constructive requests of the country's
citizens.[68] A law will be passed to allow representatives from other parties to hold Chair positions on some Parliamentary committees, to
foster alternative views and opinions. The minimum membership threshold needed to register a political party will be reduced from 40,000 to
20,000 members.[67] Special places for peaceful rallies in central areas will be allocated and a new draft law outlining the rights and
obligations of organisers, participants and observers will be passed.[67] In an effort to increase public safety, President Tokayev has
strengthened the penalties for those who commit crimes against individuals.[67]
Elections
 Elections to the Majilis in September 2004, yielded a lower house dominated by the pro-government
 Otan Party, headed by President Nazarbayev. Two other parties considered sympathetic to the
president, including the agrarian-industrial bloc AIST and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asar_Party"] Asar Party, founded by President
Nazarbayev's daughter, won most of the remaining seats. The opposition parties which were
officially registered and competed in the elections won a single seat. The Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe was monitoring the election, which it said fell short of international
standards.[69] 
On 4 December 2005, Nursultan Nazarbayev was re-elected [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ak_Orda_Presidential_Palace"] Ak Orda Presidential Palace
in an apparent landslide victory. The electoral commission
announced that he had won over 90% of the vote. The
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) concluded the election did not meet
international standards despite some improvements in the administration of the election.[70]
 Parliament of Kazakhstan 
On 17 August 2007, elections to the lower house of parliament were held and a coalition led by the
ruling [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nur-Otan"] Nur-Otan party, which included the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asar_Party"] Asar Party, the Civil Party of Kazakhstan, and the
 Agrarian Party, won every seat with 88% of the vote. None of the opposition parties has reached the
benchmark 7% level of the seats. Opposition parties made accusations of serious irregularities in the
election.[71][72]
In 2010, president Nazarbayev rejected a call from supporters to hold a referendum to keep him in
office until 2020. He insisted on presidential elections for a five-year term. In a vote held on 3 April
2011, president Nazarbayev received 95.54% of the vote with 89.9% of registered voters
participating.[73] In March 2011, Nazarbayev outlined the progress made toward democracy by
Kazakhstan.[74] As of 2010, Kazakhstan was reported on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index"] Democracy Index by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist"] The Economist
as an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian_regime"] authoritarian regime.
On 26 April 2015, the fifth presidential election was held in Kazakhstan.[75] Nursultan Nazarbayev
was re-elected with 97.7% of votes.[76]

On 19 March 2019, Nazarbayev announced his resignation from the presidency.[77] Kazakhstan's senate speaker [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassym-Jomart_Tokayev"] Kassym-Jomart Tokayev

June.[79]
Administrative divisions
Kazakhstan is divided into fourteen [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Kazakhstan"] regions (Kazakh: облыстар, oblystar; Russian: области, oblasti). The regions are subdivided into 177
 districts (Kazakh: аудандар, aýdandar; Russian: районы, rayony).[80] The districts are further subdivided into rural districts at the lowest
level of administration, which include all rural settlements and villages without an associated municipal government.[81]
The cities of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almaty"] Almaty and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nur-Sultan"] Nur-Sultan have status "state importance" and do not belong to any region. The city of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur"] Baikonur has a special
status because it is being leased until 2050 to Russia for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_cosmodrome"] Baikonur cosmodrome.[5] In June 2018 the city of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shymkent"] Shymkent became a "city of
republican significance".[82]
Each region is headed by an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akim"] äkim (regional governor) appointed by the president. District äkimi are appointed by regional akims.
Kazakhstan's government relocated its capital from Almaty, established under the Soviet Union, to Astana on 10 December 1997.[83]
Municipal divisions
Municipalities exist at each level of administrative division in Kazakhstan. Cities of republican, regional, and district significance are
designated as urban inhabited localities; all others are designated rural.[81] At the highest level are the cities of Almaty and Nur-Sultan, which
are classified as cities of republican significance on the administrative level equal to that of a region.[80] At the intermediate level are cities of
regional significance on the administrative level equal to that of a district. Cities of these two levels may be divided into city districts.[80] At
the lowest level are cities of district significance, and over two-thousand villages and rural settlements (aul) on the administrative level equal
to that of rural districts.[80]

membership, but that it would not be granted any status whatsoever at the council until its democracy and human rights records improved.
Since independence in 1991, Kazakhstan has pursued what is known as the "multivector foreign policy" (Kazakh: көпвекторлы сыртқы
саясат), seeking equally good relations with its two large neighbours, Russia and China, as well as with the United States and the rest of the
Western world.[88][89]Russia leases approximately 6,000 square kilometres (2,317 sq mi) of territory enclosing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baikonur_Cosmodrome"] Baikonur Cosmodrome

On 11 April 2010, presidents Nazarbayev and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama"] Obama met at the Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C., and discussed strengthening
the strategic partnership between the United States and Kazakhstan. They pledged to intensify bilateral co-operation to promote nuclear
safety and non-proliferation, regional stability in Central Asia, economic prosperity, and universal values.[90]
In April 2011, Obama called Nazarbayev and discussed many cooperative efforts regarding nuclear security, including securing nuclear
material from the BN-350 reactor. They reviewed progress on meeting goals that the two presidents established during their bilateral meeting
at the Nuclear Security Summit in 2010.[91]Since 2014 the Kazakhstani government has been bidding for a non-permanent member seat on
the UN Security Council for 2017–2018.[92]On 28 June 2016 Kazakhstan was elected as a non-permanent member to serve on the UN
Security Council for a two-year term.[93]
Kazakhstan has supported UN peacekeeping missions in Haiti, the Western Sahara, and Côte d'Ivoire.[94] In March 2014, the Ministry of
Defense chose 20 Kazakhstani military men as observers for the UN peacekeeping missions. The military personnel, ranking from captain to
colonel, had to go through a specialised UN training; they had to be fluent in English and skilled in using specialised military vehicles.[94]
In 2014, Kazakhstan gave Ukraine humanitarian aid during the conflict with Russian-backed rebels. In October 2014, Kazakhstan donated
$30,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross's humanitarian effort in Ukraine. In January 2015, to help the humanitarian crisis,
Kazakhstan sent $400,000 of aid to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novorossiya_(confederation)"] Ukraine's southeastern regions.[95] President Nazarbayev said of the war in Ukraine, "The fratricidal war
has brought true devastation to eastern Ukraine, and it is a common task to stop the war there, strengthen Ukraine's independence and secure
territorial integrity of Ukraine."[96] Experts believe that no matter how the Ukraine crisis develops, Kazakhstan's relations with the European
Union will remain normal.[97] It is believed that Nazarbayev's mediation is positively received by both Russia and Ukraine.[97]
Kazakhstan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement on 26 January 2015: "We are firmly convinced that there is no alternative to
 peace negotiations as a way to resolve the crisis in south-eastern Ukraine."[98] In 2018, Kazakhstan signed the UN treaty on the Prohibition
of Nuclear Weapons.[99]

 Most of Kazakhstan's military was inherited from the Soviet Armed Forces' Turkestan Military
District. These units became the core of Kazakhstan's new military. It acquired all the units of the
 40th Army (the former 32nd Army) and part of the 17th Army Corps, including six land-force
divisions, storage bases, the 14th and 35th air-landing brigades, two rocket brigades, two artillery
regiments, and a large amount of equipment that had been withdrawn from over the Urals after the
signing of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_Conventional_Armed_Forces_in_Europe"] Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. Since the late 20th century, the
Kazakhstan Army has focused on expanding the number of its armoured units. Since 1990,
armoured units have expanded from 500 to 1,613 in 2005.  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Guard_(Kazakhstan)"] Kazakhstan Republican Guard

In December 2013, Kazakhstan announced it will send officers to support United Nations Peacekeeping forces in Haiti, Western Sahara,
Ivory Coast and Liberia.[108]
Human rights
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist_Intelligence_Unit"] Economist Intelligence Unit has consistently ranked Kazakhstan as an "authoritarian regime" in its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index"] Democracy Index, ranking it 128th
out of 167 countries for 2020.[109][110]
Kazakhstan was ranked 122th out of 180 countries in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporters_Without_Borders"] Reporters Without Borders' [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Freedom_Index"] Press Freedom Index for 2022; previously it ranked 155th
for 2021.[111]
Kazakhstan's human rights situation has been described as poor by independent observers. In its 2015 report of human rights in the country,
 Human Rights Watch said that "Kazakhstan heavily restricts freedom of assembly, speech, and religion."[112] It has also described the
government as authoritarian.[113] In 2014, authorities closed newspapers, jailed or fined dozens of people after peaceful but unsanctioned
protests, and fined or detained worshipers for practising religion outside state controls. Government critics, including opposition leader
 Vladimir Kozlov, remained in detention after unfair trials. In mid-2014, Kazakhstan adopted new criminal, criminal executive, criminal
procedural, and administrative codes, and a new law on trade unions, which contain articles restricting fundamental freedoms and are
incompatible with international standards. Torture remains common in places of detention."[114] However, Kazakhstan has achieved
significant progress in reducing the prison population.[115] The 2016 Human Rights Watch report commented that Kazakhstan "took few
meaningful steps to tackle a worsening human rights record in 2015, maintaining a focus on economic development over political
 reform."[116] Some critics of the government have been arrested for allegedly spreading false information about the COVID-19 pandemic in
Kazakhstan.[117] Various police reforms, like creation of local police service and zero-tolerance policing, aimed at bringing police closer to
local communities have not improved cooperation between police and ordinary citizens.[118]
According to a U.S. government report released in 2014, in Kazakhstan:
The law does not require police to inform detainees that they have the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_an_attorney"] right to an attorney, and police did not do so. Human
rights observers alleged that law enforcement officials dissuaded detainees from seeing an attorney, gathered evidence through
preliminary questioning before a detainee's attorney arrived, and in some cases used corrupt defense attorneys to gather
evidence. [...][119]
The law does not adequately provide for an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_judiciary"] independent judiciary. The executive branch sharply limited judicial independence.
Prosecutors enjoyed a quasi-judicial role and had the authority to suspend court decisions. Corruption was evident at every stage
of the judicial process. Although judges were among the most highly paid government employees, lawyers and human rights
monitors alleged that judges, prosecutors, and other officials solicited [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribes"] bribes in exchange for favorable rulings in the majority of
criminal cases.[119]

Kazakhstan's global rank in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Justice_Project"] World Justice Project's 2015 Rule of Law Index was 65 out of 102; the country scored well on "Order and
Security" (global rank 32/102), and poorly on "Constraints on Government Powers" (global rank 93/102), "Open Government" (85/102)
and "Fundamental Rights" (84/102, with a downward trend marking a deterioration in conditions).[120]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_Rule_of_Law_Initiative"] ABA Rule of Law Initiative of the American Bar Association has programs to train justice sector professionals in Kazakhstan.[121][122]
Kazakhstan's Supreme Court has taken steps to modernise and to increase transparency and oversight over the country's legal system. With
funding from the US Agency for International Development, the ABA Rule of Law Initiative began a new program in April 2012 to
strengthen the independence and accountability of Kazakhstan's judiciary.[123]
In an effort to increase transparency in the criminal justice and court system, and improve human rights, Kazakhstan intended to digitise all
investigative, prosecutorial and court records by 2018.[124] Many criminal cases are closed before trial on the basis of reconciliation between
the defendant and the victim because they simplify the work of the law-enforcement officers, release the defendant from punishment, and pay
little regard to the victim's rights.[125]
Homosexuality has been legal in Kazakhstan since 1997, although it is still socially unacceptable in most areas.[126] Discrimination against
 LGBT people in Kazakhstan is widespread.[127][128]
Economy
Kazakhstan's economy, supported by rising oil output and prices, grew at an average of
8% per year until 2013, before suffering a slowdown in 2014 and 2015.[129]
Kazakhstan was the first former Soviet Republic to repay all of its debt to the
International Monetary Fund, 7 years ahead of schedule.[130]
Kazakhstan has a GDP of $179.332 billion and an annual growth rate of 4.5%. Per
capita, Kazakhstan's GDP stands at $9,686.[131]
Kazakhstan's increased role in global trade and central positioning on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belt_and_Road_Initiative"] new Silk Road
gave the country the potential to open its markets to billions of people.[132] Kazakhstan
joined the World Trade Organization in 2015.[133] 
Downtown [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nur-Sultan"] Nur-Sultan
Buoyed by high world [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_oil"] crude oil prices, GDP growth figures were between 8.9% and
13.5% from 2000 to 2007 before decreasing to 1–3% in 2008 and 2009, and then rising
again from 2010.[134] Other major exports of Kazakhstan include wheat, textiles, and livestock.
Kazakhstan is a leading exporter of uranium.[135][136]
Kazakhstan's economy grew by 4.6% in 2014.[137] The country experienced a slowdown in
economic growth from 2014 sparked by falling oil prices and the effects of the Ukrainian crisis.[138]
The country devalued its currency by 19% in February 2014.[139] Another 22% devaluation
occurred in August 2015.[140]
Kazakhstan's government continued to follow a conservative fiscal policy by controlling budget
spending and accumulating oil revenue savings in its Oil Fund – Samruk-Kazyna. The global
financial crisis forced Kazakhstan to increase its public borrowing to support the
economy. Public debt increased to 13.4 per cent in 2013 from 8.7 per cent in 2008.
Between 2012 and 2013, the government achieved an overall fiscal surplus of 4.5 per
cent.[141] 
GDP per capita development, since
1973
Since 2002, Kazakhstan has sought to manage strong inflows of foreign currency
without sparking inflation. Inflation has not been under strict control, however,
registering 6.6% in 2002, 6.8% in 2003, and 6.4% in 2004.
 In March 2002, the U.S. Department of Commerce granted Kazakhstan market
economy status under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Act_of_2002"] US trade law. This change in status recognised substantive market
economy reforms in the areas of currency convertibility, wage rate determination,
openness to foreign investment, and government control over the means of production
and allocation of resources. 
A proportional representation of Kazakhstan
exports, 2019
Kazakhstan weathered the global financial crisis by combining fiscal relaxation with
monetary stabilisation. In 2009, the government introduced large-scale support measures such as the recapitalisation of banks and support for
the real estate and agricultural sectors, as well as for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The total value of the stimulus programs
amounted to $21 billion, or 20 per cent of the country's GDP, with $4 billion going to stabilise the financial sector.[142] During the global
economic crisis, Kazakhstan's economy contracted by 1.2% in 2009, while the annual growth rate subsequently increased to 7.5% and 5% in
2011 and 2012, respectively.[129]

In September 2002, Kazakhstan became the first country in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States"] CIS to receive an investment grade
 credit rating from a major international [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating_agency"] credit rating agency.[143] By late December 2003,
Kazakhstan's gross foreign debt was about $22.9 billion. Total governmental debt was $4.2 billion,
14% of GDP. There has been a reduction in the ratio of debt to GDP. The ratio of total governmental
debt to GDP in 2000, was 21.7%; in 2001, it was 17.5%, and in 2002, it was 15.4%. It rose to 19.2%
in 2019.[144]
Economic growth, combined with earlier [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_reform"] tax and financial sector reforms, has dramatically improved
government finance from the 1999 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget_deficit"] budget deficit level of 3.5% of GDP to a deficit of 1.2% of GDP
in 2003. Government revenues grew from 19.8% of GDP in 1999 to 22.6% of GDP in 2001, but
decreased to 16.2% of GDP in 2003. In 2000, Kazakhstan adopted a new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_code"] tax code in an effort to
consolidate these gains. 
 Aktau is Kazakhstan's only seaport

On 29 November 2003, the Law on Changes to Tax Code which reduced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rates_around_the_world"] tax rates was adopted. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_added_tax"] value added tax fell from 16% to 15%,
the social tax, payable by all employers, from 21% to 20%, and the personal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax"] income tax, from 30% to 20%. On 7 July 2006, the personal
income tax was reduced even further to a flat rate of 5% for personal income in the form of dividends and 10% for other personal income.
Kazakhstan furthered its reforms by adopting a new land code on 20 June 2003, and a new customs code on 5 April 2003.
Energy has been the leading economic sector. Production of crude oil and
 natural gas condensate from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_and_gas_basins_of_Kazakhstan"] oil and gas basins of Kazakhstan amounted to
79.2 million tonnes (77.9 million [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_ton"] long tons; 87.3 million [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_ton"] short tons) in 2012 up
from 51.2 million tonnes (50.4 million long tons; 56.4 million short tons) in
2003. Kazakhstan raised oil and gas condensate exports to 44.3 million tons in
2003, 13% higher than in 2002. Gas production in Kazakhstan in 2003,
amounted to 13.9 billion cubic metres (490 billion [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_foot"] cubic feet),  up 22.7%
compared to 2002, including natural gas production of 7.3 billion cubic metres
(260 billion cubic feet). Kazakhstan holds about 4 billion tonnes (3.9 billion
long tons; 4.4 billion short tons) of proven recoverable oil reserves and 2,000 A map of Kazakhstan's imports, 2013
cubic kilometres (480 cubic miles) of gas. Kazakhstan is the 19th largest oil-
producing nation in the world.[145] Kazakhstan's oil exports in 2003, were
 valued at more than $7 billion, representing 65% of overall exports and 24% of the GDP. Major oil and gas fields and recoverable oil
reserves are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengiz_Field"] Tengiz with 7 billion barrels (1.1 billion cubic metres); [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachaganak_Field"] Karachaganak with 8 billion barrels (1.3 billion cubic metres) and 1,350

developed by BG, Agip, ChevronTexaco, and Lukoil.[147] Also [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"] Chinese oil companies are involved in the Kazakhstan's oil industry.[148]
Kazakhstan instituted a pension reform program in 1998. ByJanuary 2012, the pension assets were about $17 billion (KZT 2.5 trillion).
There are 11 saving pension funds in the country. The State Accumulating Pension Fund, the only state-owned fund, was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization"] privatised in 2006.
The country's unified financial regulatory agency oversees and regulates the pension funds. The growing demand of the pension funds for
investment outlets triggered development of the debt [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)"] securities market. Pension fund capital is being invested almost exclusively in corporate
and government bonds, including government of Kazakhstan Eurobonds. The government of Kazakhstan was studying a project to create a
unified national pension fund and transfer all the accounts from the private pension funds into it.[149]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bank_of_Kazakhstan"] Kazakh National Bank introduced deposit insurance in a campaign to strengthen the banking sector. Several major foreign banks had
branches in Kazakhstan, including RBS, Citibank, and HSBC. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kookmin&action=edit&redlink=1"] Kookmin and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UniCredit"] UniCredit both entered the Kazakhstan's financial services
market through acquisitions and stake-building.
According to the 2010–11 World Economic Forum in Global Competitiveness Report, Kazakhstan was ranked 72nd in the world in
economic competitiveness.[150]One year later, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Competitiveness_Report"] Global Competitiveness Report ranked Kazakhstan 50th in most competitive
markets.[151]
In 2012, Kazakhstan attracted $14 billion of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment"] foreign direct investment inflows into the country at a 7% growth rate.[152] In 2018, $24 billion
of FDI was directed into Kazakhstan, a significant increase since 2012.[153]
Kazakhstan climbed to 41st on the 2018 Economic Freedom Index published by the Wall Street Journal and The Heritage Foundation.[154]
Kazakhstan's economy grew at an average of 8% per year over the past decade on the back of hydrocarbon exports.[129] Despite the
lingering uncertainty of the global economy, Kazakhstan's economy has been stable. GDP growth in January–September 2013 was 5.7%,
according to preliminary calculations of the Ministry Economy and Budget Planning.[155]
From January to September 2014 Kazakhstan's GDP grew at 4%.[156] According to the results from the first half of the year, the current
account surplus is $6.6 billion, a figure two times higher than that of the first half of 2013.[156] According to the Chairman of the National
Bank of Kazakhstan, Kairat Kelimbetov, the increase was caused by a trade surplus of 17.4 percent, or approximately US$22.6 billion.[156]
The overall inflation rate for 2014 is forecasted at 7.4 percent.[156]

 China is one of the main economic and trade partners of Kazakhstan. In 2013, China launched the Belt
and Road Initiative (BRI) in which Kazakhstan functions as a transit hub.[157]
Foreign trade
Kazakhstan's foreign trade turnover in 2018 was $93.5 billion, which is 19.7% more compared to 2017.
Export in 2018 reached $67 billion (+25.7% vs 2017) and import was $32.5 billion (+9.9% vs
2017).[158] Exports accounted for 40.1% of Kazakhstan's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018.
Kazakhstan exports 800 products to 120 countries.[159]
Agriculture
 Agriculture accounts for approximately 5% of Kazakhstan's GDP.[5] Grain, potatoes, grapes, vegetables,
melons and livestock are the most important agricultural commodities. Agricultural land occupies
more than 846,000 square kilometres (327,000 sq mi). The available agricultural land consists of
205,000 km2 (79,000 sq mi) of arable land and 611,000 km2 (236,000 sq mi) of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasture"] pasture and hay
land. Over 80% of the country's total area is classified as agricultural land, including almost 70%
occupied by pasture. Its arable land has the second highest availability per inhabitant (1.5
hectares).[160] 
Kazakhstan has the largest
proven [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy_of_Kazakhstan"] oil reserves in the
Caspian Sea region.
Chief livestock products are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product"] dairy products, leather, meat, and wool. The country's major crops
include wheat, barley, cotton, and rice. Wheat exports, a major source of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_currency"] hard currency, rank among
the leading commodities in Kazakhstan's export trade. In 2003 Kazakhstan harvested 17.6 million
tons of grain in gross, 2.8% higher compared to 2002. Kazakhstani agriculture still has many
 environmental problems from mismanagement during its years in the Soviet Union. Some Kazakh
wine is produced in the mountains to the east of Almaty.[161]

is called Almaty: "rich with apple".[163] This tree is still found wild in the mountains of Central Asia, in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
 Tajikistan and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang"] Xinjiang in China.
Infrastructure
Railways provide 68% of all cargo and passenger traffic to over 57% of the country. There are 15,333 km (9,527 mi) in common carrier
service, excluding industrial lines.[164]15,333 km (9,527 mi) of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_ft_and_1520_mm_gauge_railways"] 1,520 mm (4 ft 1127⁄32 in) gauge, 4,000 km (2,500 mi) electrified, in

than 600 staff and two joint ventures with KTZ and its subsidiary in Kazakhstan.[165] In July 2017,
Alstom opened its first locomotive repairing centre in Kazakhstan. It is the only repairing centre in
Central Asia and the Caucasus.[166]

Map of Kazakhstan railway network
 Astana Nurly Zhol railway station, the most modern railway station in Kazakhstan, was opened in
Nur-Sultan on 31 May 2017. The opening of the station coincided with the start of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_2017"] Expo 2017
international exhibition. According to Kazakhstan Railways (KTZ), the 120,000m2 station was
expected to be used by 54 trains and would have the capacity to handle 35,000 passengers a
day.[167]
There is a small 8.56 km (5.32 mi) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"] metro system in Almaty. A second and third metro lines were
planned for the future. The second line would intersect with the first line at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alatau_(Almaty_Metro)"] Alatau and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhibek_Zholy_(Almaty_Metro)"] Zhibek Zholy
stations.[168] In May 2011, the construction of the second phase of the Almaty Metro line 1 began.
The general contractor is Almatymetrokurylys. More than 300 m (980 ft) of tunnels on the extension
project have been excavated. The extension includes five new stations, and will connect the
downtown area of Almaty with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalkaman"] Kalkaman in the suburbs. Its length will be 8.62 km (5.36 mi).[169]

The construction is divided into 3 phases. The first phase (the current phase) will be the addition of
two stations: Sairan and Moscow, a length of 2.7 km (1.7 mi).[169] For more details see: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almaty_Metro"] Almaty Metro.There was a tram system of 10 lines
which operated from 1937 to 2015.[170]

The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astana_Metro"] Astana Metro system has been under construction, but was abandoned at one point in 2013.[171] In May 2015, an agreement was signed
for the project to be resumed.[172] There is an 86 km (53 mi) tram network, which began service in 1965 with, as of 2012, 20 regular and
three special routes.[173]
The Khorgos Gateway dry port is one of Kazakhstan's primary dry ports for handling trans-Eurasian trains, which travel more than 9,000 km
(5,600 mi) between China and Europe. The Khorgos Gateway dry port is surrounded by Khorgos Eastern Gate SEZ that officially
commenced operations in December 2016.[174]
In 2009 the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"] European Commission blacklisted all Kazakh air carriers with a sole exception of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Astana"] Air Astana.[175] Thereafter, Kazakhstan took
measures to modernise and revamp its air safety oversight. In 2016 the European air safety authorities removed all Kazakh airlines from the
blacklist, saying there was "sufficient evidence of compliance" with international standards by Kazakh Airlines and the Civil Aviation
Committee.[176]
Tourism
Kazakhstan is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area"] ninth-largest country by area and the largest landlocked country in the world. As
of 2014, tourism accounted for 0.3% of Kazakhstan's GDP, but the government had plans to increase
 it to 3% by 2020.[177][178] According to the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism
Competitiveness Report of 2017, travel and tourism industry GDP in Kazakhstan was $3.08 billion
or only 1.6 percent of total GDP. The WEF ranked Kazakhstan 80th in its 2019 report.[179]
In 2017, Kazakhstan ranked 43rd in the number of tourist arrivals.</ref> In 2014, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian"] The Guardian
described tourism in Kazakhstan as, "hugely underdeveloped", despite the country's mountain, lake
and desert landscapes.[180] Factors hampering an increase in tourism were said to include high
prices, "shabby infrastructure," "poor service" and the difficulties of travel in a large underdeveloped
country.[180] Even for Kazakhs, going for holiday abroad may have cost only half the price of taking
a holiday in Kazakhstan.[180] 
Borovoe, view from Mount Bolectau
The Kazakh Government, long characterised as authoritarian with a history of human rights abuses
and suppression of political opposition,[12] in 2015 issued a "Tourism Industry Development Plan
 2020." It aimed to establish five tourism clusters in Kazakhstan: Nur-Sultan city, Almaty city, East
Kazakhstan, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Kazakhstan_Region"] South Kazakhstan, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Kazakhstan_Region"] West Kazakhstan Oblasts. It also sought investment of $4 billion
and the creation of 300,000 new jobs in the tourism industry by 2020.[181][180] 
A ski resort in Almaty
Kazakhstan has offered a permanent visa-free regime for up to 90 days to citizens of Armenia,

30 days to citizens of Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Serbia, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea"] South Korea, Tajikistan, Turkey, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE"] UAE and Uzbekistan. It also established a visa-
free regime for citizens of 54 countries, including the European Union and OECD member states, the U.S., Japan, Mexico, Australia and
New Zealand.[182][183]
Green economy
Kazakhstan launched the Green Economy Plan in 2013. It committed Kazakhstan to meet 50% of its energy needs from alternative and
renewable sources by 2050.[184] The green economy was projected to increase GDP by 3% and create some 500,000 jobs.[185] The
government set prices for energy produced from renewable sources. The price of 1 kilowatt-hour for energy produced by wind power plants
was set at 22.68 tenge ($0.12), for 1 kilowatt-hour produced by small hydro-power plants 16.71 tenge ($0.09), and from biogas plants 32.23
tenge ($0.18).[186]
Foreign direct investment
Kazakhstan has attracted $330 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) from more than 120 countries since its
independence.[187] In 2015, the U.S. State Department said Kazakhstan was widely considered to have the best
investment climate in the region.[188] In 2014, President Nazarbayev signed into law tax concessions to promote
foreign direct investment which included a 10-year exemption from corporation tax, an eight-year exemption
from property tax, and a 10-year freeze on most other taxes.[189] Other incentives include a refund on capital
investments of up to 30 percent once a production facility is in operation.[189]
In 2014, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Bank_of_Reconstruction_and_Development"] European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Kazakhstan created the
artnership for Re-Energizing the Reform Process in Kazakhstan to work with international financial institutions
to channel US$2.7 billion provided by the Kazakh government into important sectors of Kazakhstan's
economy.[190] 
Astana [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_2017"] Expo 2017 "Nur
Alem" Pavilion
As of May 2014, Kazakhstan had attracted $190 billion in gross foreign investments since its independence in 1991 and it led the CIS
countries in terms of FDI attracted per capita.[191] One of the factors that attract foreign direct investments is country's political stability.
Page 15
The OECD 2017 Investment Policy Review noted that "great strides" had been made to open up opportunities to foreign investors and
improving policy to attract FDI.[192]
Banking
The banking industry of Kazakhstan went through a boom-and-bust cycle in the early 21st century. After several years of rapid expansion in
the mid-2000s, the banking industry collapsed in 2008. Several large banking groups, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTA_Bank"] BTA Bank J.S.C. and Alliance Bank,
defaulted soon thereafter. The industry shrank and was restructured, with system-wide loans dropping from 59% of GDP in 2007 to 39% in
2011. Although the Russian and Kazakhstani banking systems share some common features, there are key differences: Banks in Kazakhstan
experienced a lengthy period of political stability and economic growth, which helped push Kazakhstan's banking system to a higher level of
development. Banking technology and personnel qualifications were stronger in Kazakhstan. On the negative side, past stability in
Kazakhstan arose from the concentration of virtually all political power in the hands of a single individual – the key factor in any assessment
of system or country risk.[193]
Bond market
In October 2014, Kazakhstan introduced its first overseas dollar bonds in 14 years.[194] Kazakhstan issued $2.5 billion of 10- and 30-year
bonds on 5 October 2014, in what was the nation's first dollar-denominated overseas sale since 2000.[194] Kazakhstan sold $1.5 billion of
10-year dollar bonds to yield 1.5 percentage points above midswaps and $1 billion of 30-year debt at two percentage points over
midswaps.[194] The country drew bids for $11 billion.[194]
Housing market
The housing market of Kazakhstan grew after 2010. In 2013, the total housing area in Kazakhstan
amounted to 336.1 million square metres (3,618 million square feet). Urban areas contained 62.5
percent of the country's housing stock. The housing stock rose over the year to 32.7 million sq. ft.,
nearly an 11% increase. Between 2012 and 2013, the living area per Kazakh citizen rose from 19.6
to 20.9 square metres (211 to 225 square feet).The UN's recommended standard for housing stands
at 30 square metres (320 square feet) per person. Kazakhstan was projected to reach the UN
standards by 2019 or 2020.[195]
"Nurly Jol" economic policy  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almaty"] Almaty
On 11 November 2014, President of Kazakhstan [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursultan_Nazarbayev"] Nursultan Nazarbayev delivered an unexpected
state-of-the-nation address in Nur-Sultan at an extended session of the Political Council of the Nur Otan party, introducing a "Nurly Jol"
(Bright Path), a new economic policy that implies massive state investment in infrastructure over the next several years.[196] The "Nurly
Zhol" policy is accepted as preventive measures needed to help steer the economy towards sustainable growth in the context of the modern
global economic and geopolitical challenges, such as the 25%-reduction in the oil price, reciprocal sanctions between the West and Russia
over Ukraine, etc.[196] The policy embraces all aspects of economic growth, including finances, industry and social welfare, but especially
emphasises investments into the development of infrastructure and construction works.[196] Given recent decreases in revenues from the
export of raw materials, funds will be used from Kazakhstan's National Fund.[196]
Economic competitiveness
In the 2020 Doing Business Report by the World Bank, Kazakhstan ranked 25th globally and as the number one best country globally for
protecting minority investors’ rights.[197] Kazakhstan achieved its goal of entering the top 50 most competitive countries in 2013, and has
maintained its position in the 2014–2015 World Economic Forum [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Competitiveness_Report"] Global Competitiveness Report that was published at the beginning of
September 2014.[198] Kazakhstan is ahead of other states in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States"] CIS in almost all of the report's pillars of competitiveness, including
institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, higher education and training, goods market efficiency, labour market development,
financial market development, technological readiness, market size, business sophistication and innovation, lagging behind only in the
category of health and primary education.[198] The Global Competitiveness Index gives a score from 1 to 7 in each of these pillars, and
Kazakhstan earned an overall score of 4.4.[198]
Corruption
In 2005, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank"] World Bank listed Kazakhstan as a corruption hotspot, on a par with Angola, Bolivia, Kenya, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libya"] Libya and Pakistan.[199] In 2012,
Kazakhstan ranked low in an index of the least corrupt countries[200] and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum"] World Economic Forum listed corruption as the biggest
problem in doing business in the country.[200]A 2017 OECD report on Kazakhstan indicated that Kazakhstan has reformed laws with regard
to the civil service, judiciary, instruments to prevent corruption, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_to_information"] access to information, and prosecuting corruption.[201] Kazakhstan has
implemented anticorruption reforms that have been recognised by organizations like Transparency International.[202]
Page 16
In 2011 Switzerland confiscated US$48 million in Kazakhstani assets from Swiss bank accounts, as a result of a bribery investigation in the
United States.[203] US officials believed the funds represented bribes paid by American officials to Kazakhstani officials in exchange for oil
or prospecting rights in Kazakhstan. Proceedings eventually involved US$84 million in the US and another US$60 million in
Switzerland.[203]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation"] Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Kazakh Anti-Corruption Agency signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty in February
2015.[204]
Science and technology
Research remains largely concentrated in Kazakhstan's largest city and former capital, Almaty, home
to 52% of research personnel. Public research is largely confined to institutes, with universities
making only a token contribution. Research institutes receive their funding from national research
councils under the umbrella of the Ministry of Education and Science. Their output, however, tends
to be disconnected from market needs. In the business sector, few industrial enterprises conduct
research themselves.[205][206]

One of the most ambitious targets of the State Programme for
Accelerated Industrial and Innovative Development adopted in 2010 is
to raise the country's level of expenditure on research and development
to 1% of GDP by 2015. By 2013, this ratio stood at 0.18% of GDP. It
will be difficult to reach the target as long as economic growth remains
strong. Since 2005, the economy has grown faster (by 6% in 2013) than
gross domestic expenditure on research and development, which only
progressed from PPP$598 million to PPP$714 million between 2005
and 2013.[206]
Innovation expenditure more than doubled in Kazakhstan between 2010
and 2011, representing KZT 235 billion (circa US$1.6 billion),  or
around 1.1% of GDP. Some 11% of the total was spent on research and
development. This compares with about 40–70% of innovation

expenditure in developed countries. This augmentation was due to a
sharp rise in product design and the introduction of new services and
production methods over this period, to the detriment of the acquisition of machinery and equipment, which has
traditionally made up the bulk of Kazakhstan's innovation expenditure. Training costs represented just 2% of
innovation expenditure, a much lower share than in developed countries.[205][206] Kazakhstan was ranked 79th
in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Innovation_Index"] Global Innovation Index in 2021.[207]
In December 2012, President Nursultan Nazarbayev announced the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kazakhstan_2050_Strategy&action=edit&redlink=1"] Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy with the slogan "Strong Business, Strong
State." This pragmatic strategy proposes sweeping socio-economic and political reforms to hoist Kazakhstan among the top 30 economies by
2050. In this document, Kazakhstan gives itself 15 years to evolve into a knowledge economy. New sectors are to be created during each
five-year plan. The first of these, covering the years 2010–2014, focused on developing industrial capacity in car manufacturing, aircraft
engineering and the production of locomotives, passenger and cargo railroad cars. During the second five-year plan to 2019, the goal is to
develop export markets for these products. To enable Kazakhstan to enter the world market of geological exploration, the country intends to
increase the efficiency of traditional extractive sectors such as oil and gas. It also intends to develop rare earth metals, given their importance
for electronics, laser technology, communication and medical equipment. The second five-year plan coincides with the development of the
Business 2020 roadmap for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which makes provision for the allocation of grants to SMEs in the
regions and for microcredit. The government and the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs also plan to develop an effective mechanism to
help start-ups.[206]
During subsequent five-year plans to 2050, new industries will be established in fields such as
mobile, multi-media, nano- and space technologies, robotics, genetic engineering and alternative
energy. Food processing enterprises will be developed with an eye to turning the country into a major
regional exporter of beef, dairy and other agricultural products. Low-return, water-intensive crop
varieties will be replaced with vegetable, oil and fodder products. As part of the shift to a "green
economy" by 2030, 15% of acreage will be cultivated with water-saving technologies. Experimental
agrarian and innovational clusters will be established and drought-resistant [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_crops"] genetically modified crops
developed.[206]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kazakhstan_2050_Strategy&action=edit&redlink=1"] Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy fixes a target of devoting 3% of GDP to research and development
by 2050 to allow for the development of new high-tech sectors.[206]

The Digital Kazakhstan program was launched in 2018 to boost the country's economic growth
through the implementation of digital technologies. Kazakhstan's digitization efforts generated 800 billion tenge (US$1.97 billion) in two
years. The program helped create 120,000 jobs and attracted 32.8 billion tenge (US$80.7 million) of investment into the country.
82% of all public services became automated as part of the Digital Kazakhstan program.[208]

Demographics
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Census_Bureau"] US Census Bureau International Database lists the population of Kazakhstan as 18.9 million
(May 2019),[209] while United Nations sources such as the 2019 revision of the World Population
Prospects[210][211] give an estimate of 18,319,618. Official estimates put the population of
Kazakhstan at 18.711 million as of May 2020.[212] In 2013, Kazakhstan's population rose to
17,280,000 with a 1.7% growth rate over the past year according to the Kazakhstan Statistics
Agency.[213]
The 2009 population estimate is 6.8% higher than the population reported in the last census from
January 1999. The decline in population that began after 1989 has been arrested and possibly
reversed. Men and women make up 48.3% and 51.7% of the population, respectively. 
 Population pyramid, 2020
Ethnic groups
As of 2018, ethnic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhs"] Kazakhs are 67.5% of the population and ethnic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians_in_Kazakhstan"] Russians in Kazakhstan are
19.8%.[214] Other groups include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatars"] Tatars (1.3%), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians"] Ukrainians (2.1%), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbeks"] Uzbeks (2.8%), Belarusians,
 Uyghurs (1.4%), Azerbaijanis, Dungans, Kalmyks, Chuvashes, Poles,[215] and Lithuanians. Some
minorities such as Ukrainians, Koreans, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volga_Germans"] Volga Germans (1.1%), Chechens,[216] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meskhetian_Turks"] Meskhetian Turks,
and Russian political opponents of the regime, had been [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_transfer_in_the_Soviet_Union"] deported to Kazakhstan in the 1930s and
1940s by Stalin. Some of the largest Soviet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_camp"] labour camps (Gulag) existed in the country.[217] 
Central Asian ethnolinguistic

 Significant Russian immigration was also connected with the Virgin Lands Campaign and Soviet
space program during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikita_Khrushchev"] Khrushchev era.[218] In 1989, ethnic Russians were 37.8% of the population and Kazakhs held a majority in only
 7 of the 20 regions of the country. Before 1991 there were about 1 million Germans in Kazakhstan, mostly descendants of the Volga
Germans deported to Kazakhstan during World War II. After the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union"] dissolution of the Soviet Union, most of them emigrated to Germany.[219]
Most members of the smaller [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontian_Greek"] Pontian Greek minority have emigrated to Greece. In the late 1930s thousands of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koreans"] Koreans in the Soviet Union
were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Koreans_in_the_Soviet_Union"] deported to Central Asia.[220] These people are now known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koryo-saram"] Koryo-saram.[221]
 The 1990s were marked by the emigration of many of the country's Russians, Ukrainians and Volga
Germans, a process that began in the 1970s. This has made indigenous Kazakhs the largest ethnic
group.[222] Additional factors in the increase in the Kazakhstani population are higher birthrates and
 immigration of ethnic Kazakhs from China, Mongolia, and Russia.

Languages
Kazakhstan is officially a bilingual country. Kazakh, (part of the Kipchak family of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_languages"] Turkic languages)[230] spoken natively by 64.4% of the
population, has the status of "state" language, whereas Russian, which is spoken by most Kazakhs,[231] is declared an "official" language,
and is used routinely in business, government, and inter-ethnic communication, although Kazakh is slowly replacing it.[232]
The government announced in January 2015 that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet"] Latin alphabet will replace [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic"] Cyrillic as the writing system for the Kazakh language by
2025.[233] Other minority languages spoken in Kazakhstan include Uzbek, Ukrainian, Uyghur, Kyrgyz, and Tatar. English, as well as
Turkish, have gained popularity among younger people since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Education across Kazakhstan is conducted in
Page 18
either Kazakh, Russian, or both.[234] In Nazarbayev's resignation speech of 2019, he projected that the people of Kazakhstan in the future
will speak three languages (Kazakh, Russian and English).[235]

 Islam is the largest religion in Kazakhstan, followed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodoxy_in_Kazakhstan"] Eastern Orthodox Christianity. After decades
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_Soviet_Union"] religious suppression by the Soviet Union, the coming of independence witnessed a surge in
expression of ethnic identity, partly through religion. The free practice of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion"] religious beliefs and the
establishment of full freedom of religion led to an increase of religious activity. Hundreds of
mosques, churches, and other religious structures were built in the span of a few years, with the
number of religious associations rising from 670 in 1990 to 4,170 today.[240]
Some figures show that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-denominational_Muslims"] non-denominational Muslims[241] form the majority, while others indicate
that most Muslims in the country are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam"] Sunnis following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanafi"] Hanafi school.[242] These include ethnic
Kazakhs, who constitute about 60% of the population, as well as ethnic Uzbeks, Uighurs, and

Education
Education is universal and mandatory through to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_education"] secondary level and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_literacy_rate"] adult literacy rate is
99.5%.[249] On average, these statistics are equal to both women and men in Kazakhstan.[250]
Education consists of three main phases: primary education (forms 1–4), basic general education
(forms 5–9) and senior level education (forms 10–11 or 12) divided into continued general education
and vocational education. Vocational Education usually lasts three or four years.[251] (Primary
education is preceded by one year of pre-school education.) These levels can be followed in one
institution or in different ones (e.g.,  primary school, then secondary school).  Recently, several
secondary schools, specialised schools, magnet schools, gymnasiums, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyceum#Lyceums_in_today's_education"] lyceums and linguistic and
technical gymnasiums have been founded. Secondary professional education is offered in special
professional or technical schools, lyceums or colleges and vocational schools.[249] 
 Khazret Sultan Mosque is the

At present, there are universities, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy"] academies and institutes, conservatories, higher schools and higher Kazakh National University of Arts
colleges. There are three main levels: basic higher education that provides the fundamentals of the
chosen field of study and leads to the award of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree"] Bachelor's degree; specialised higher education after which students are awarded the
Specialist's Diploma; and scientific-pedagogical higher education which leads to the master's degree. Postgraduate education leads to the
 Kandidat Nauk ("Candidate of Sciences") and the Doctor of Sciences (PhD). With the adoption of the Laws on Education and on Higher
Education, a private sector has been established and several private institutions have been licensed.
Over 2,500 students in Kazakhstan have applied for student loans totalling about $9 million. The largest number of student loans come from
Almaty, Nur-Sultan and Kyzylorda.[252]
The training and skills development programs in Kazakhstan are also supported by international organisations. For example, on 30 March
2015, the World Banks' Group of Executive Directors approved a $100 million loan for the Skills and Job project in Kazakhstan.[253] The
project aims to provide training to unemployed, unproductively self-employed, and employees in need of training.[253]

Culture 
Before the Russian colonisation, the Kazakhs had a highly developed culture based on their nomadic pastoral
economy. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"] Islam was introduced into the region with the arrival of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs"] Arabs in the 8th century. It initially
took hold in the southern parts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkestan"] Turkestan and spread northward.[254] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samanids"] Samanids helped the religion
take root through zealous missionary work. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horde"] Golden Horde further propagated Islam amongst the tribes
in the region during the 14th century.[255]
Kazakhstan is home to a large number of prominent contributors to literature,
 science and philosophy: Abay Qunanbayuli, Mukhtar Auezov, Gabit
 Musirepov, Kanysh Satpayev, Mukhtar Shakhanov, Saken Seyfullin, Jambyl
Jabayev, among many others.
Tourism is a rapidly growing industry in Kazakhstan and it is joining the
international tourism networking. In 2010, Kazakhstan joined The Region

metallogeny, principal
 Kazakh literature is defined as "the body of literature, both oral and written, produced in the Kazakh
language by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_people"] Kazakh people of Central Asia".[256] Kazakh literature expands from the current territory of
Kazakhstan, also including the era of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_Soviet_Socialist_Republic"] Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic, Kazakh recognised territory under 
advocate and the first
 president of Kazakhstan
Academy of Sciences
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire"] Russian Empire and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_Khanate"] Kazakh Khanate. There is some overlap with several complementary themes,
including the literature of Turkic tribes that inhabited Kazakhstan over the course of the history and literature written by ethnic Kazakhs.
According to Chinese written sources of 6th–8th centuries CE, Turkic tribes of Kazakhstan had oral
poetry tradition. These came from earlier periods, and were primarily transmitted by bards:
 professional storytellers and musical performers.[257] Traces of this tradition are shown on Orkhon
script stone carvings dated 5th–7th centuries CE that describe rule of Kultegin and Bilge, two early
Turkic rulers ("kagans"). Amongst the Kazakhs, the bard was a primarily, though not exclusively,
male profession. Since at least the 17th century, Kazakh bards could be divided in two main
categories: the zhıraws (zhiraus, žyraus), who passed on the works of others, usually not creating and
adding their own original work; and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqyn"] aqyns (akyns), who improvised or created their own poems,
stories or songs.[256] There were several types of works, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didactic"] didactic termes, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegiac"] elegiac tolgaws,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_(genre)"] epic zhırs.[256] Although the origins of such tales are often unknown, most of them were
associated with bards of the recent or more distant past, who supposedly created them or passed them
on, by the time most Kazakh poetry and prose was first written down in the second half of the 19th
century.[256] There are clear stylistic differences between works first created in the 19th century, and 
1965 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"] Soviet stamp honouring
 Kazakh essayist and poet Abai

works dating from earlier periods but not documented before the 19th century, such as those
attributed to such 16th- and 17th-century bards as Er Shoban and Dosmombet Zhıraw (also known as Dospambet Žyrau; he appeared to
have been literate, and reportedly visited Constantinople), and even to such 15th-century bards as Shalkiz and Asan Qayghı.[256]
Other notable bards include Kaztugan Žyrau, Žiembet Žyrau, Axtamberdy Žyrau, and Buxar Žyrau Kalkamanuly, who was an advisor to
 Ablai Khan, and whose works have been preserved by Mäšhür Žüsip Köpeev.[257] Er Targhın and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpamysh"] Alpamıs are two of the most famous
examples of Kazakh literature to be recorded in the 19th century.[256] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Dede_Korkut"] Book of Dede Korkut and Oguz Name (a story of ancient Turkic
king [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oghuz_Khan"] Oghuz Khan) are the most well-known Turkic heroic legends. Initially created around 9th century CE, they were passed on through
generations in oral form. The legendary tales were recorded by Turkish authors in 14–16th centuries C.E.[258][259]
The preeminent role in the development of modern literary Kazakh belongs to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abai_Qunanbaiuly"] Abai Qunanbaiuly (Kazakh: Абай Құнанбайұлы, sometimes
russified to Abay Kunanbayev, Абай Кунанбаев) (1845–1904), whose writings did much to preserve Kazakh folk culture. Abai's major
work is The Book of Words (Kazakh: қара сөздері, Qara sözderi), a philosophical treatise and collection of poems where he criticises
Russian colonial policies and encourages other Kazakhs to embrace education and literacy. The literary magazines [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ay_Qap"] Ay Qap (published
between 1911 and 1915 in Arabic script) and Qazaq (published between 1913 and 1918) played an important role in the development of the
intellectual and political life among early 20th-century Kazakhs.[260]
Music
The modern state of Kazakhstan is home to the Kazakh State Kurmangazy Orchestra of Folk Instruments, the Kazakh State Philharmonic
Orchestra, the Kazakh National Opera and the Kazakh State Chamber Orchestra. The folk instrument orchestra was named after
 Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly, a famous composer and dombra player from the 19th century. The Musical-Dramatic Training College, founded
Page 20
in 1931, was the first institute of higher education for music. Two years later, the Orchestra of
Kazakh Folk Musical Instruments was formed.[261]The Foundation Asyl Mura is archiving and
publishing historical recordings of great samples of Kazakh music both traditional and classical.The
leading conservatoire is in Almaty, the Qurmanghazy Conservatoire. It competes with the national
conservatoire in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan's capital.
When referring to traditional Kazakh music, authentic folklore must be separated from "folklorism".
The latter denotes music executed by academically trained performers who aim at preserving the
traditional music for coming generations. As far as can be reconstructed, the music of Kazakhstan
from the period before a strong Russian influence consists of instrumental music and vocal music.
Instrumental music, with the pieces ("Küy") being performed by soloists. Text is often seen in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowruz"] Nowruz on stamp of Kazakhstan
background (or "program") for the music, as a lot of Küy titles refer to stories. Vocal music, either as
part of a ceremony such as a wedding (mainly performed by women), or as part of a feast. Here we might divide into subgenres: epic
singing, containing not only historical facts, but as well the tribe's genealogy, love songs, didactic verses; and as a special form the
composition of two or more singers in public (Aitys), of dialogue character and usually unexpectedly frankly in content.
The Russian influence on the music life in Kazakhstan can be seen in two spheres: first, the
introduction of musical academic institutions such as concert houses with opera stages,
conservatories, where the European music was performed and taught, and second, by trying to
 incorporate Kazakh traditional music into these academic structures.Controlled first by the Russian
Empire and then the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"] Soviet Union, Kazakhstan's folk and classical traditions became connected with
 ethnic Russian music and Western European music. Prior to the 20th century, Kazakh folk music was
collected and studied by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnography"] ethnographic research teams including composers, music critics and
musicologists. In the first part of the 19th century, Kazakh music was transcribed in linear notation.
Some composers of this era set Kazakh folk songs to Russian-style [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_classical_music"] European classical music. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Studio"] A-Studio was created in 1982 in
The Kazakhs themselves, however, did not write their own music in notation until 1931. Later, as
part of the Soviet Union, Kazakh folk culture was encouraged in a sanitised manner designed to 
Almaty, then called Alma-Ata, hence
called "Alma-Ata Studio"
avoid political and social unrest. The result was a bland derivative of real Kazakh folk music. In
1920, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Zatayevich"] Aleksandr Zatayevich, a Russian official, created major works of art music with melodies and other elements of Kazakh folk music.
Beginning in 1928 and accelerating in the 1930s, he also adapted traditional Kazakh instruments for use in Russian-style ensembles, such as
by increasing the number of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fret"] frets and strings. Soon, these styles of modern orchestral playing became the only way for musicians to officially
play; Kazakh folk was turned into patriotic, professional and socialist endeavours.[262]
The current situation could be described as the effort to rediscover the traditional music as it had been practised before the heavy influence of
European musical styles. Contemporary musicians performing among traditional folk music are trained professionals (Rauchan Orazbaeva,
Ramazan Stamgazi).
Another very challenging aspect arises from the young composers generation, and the rock and jazz musicians, as they aim to incorporate
their traditional heritage into the music they learned from the western cultures, thus forming a new stage of "ethnic contemporary classics",
 respectively ethnic rock or jazz music that sounds distinctly Kazakh. For the classical sector outstanding: Aqtoty Raimkulova, Turan
ensemble; for jazz: "Magic of Nomads"; for rock: Roksonaki, Urker, Ulytau, Alda span.
Fine arts
In Kazakhstan, the fine arts in the classical sense has its origins in the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.
It was largely influenced by Russian artists, such as Vasily Vereshchagin and Nikolai Khludov, who internsively travelled in Central Asia.
Khludov had a particular influence on the development of the local school of painting, becoming the teacher of many local artists. The most
famous of these is Abilkhan Kasteyev, after whom the State Museum of Art of Kazakhstan was renamed in 1984.[263]
The Kazakh school of fine arts was fully formed by the 1940s, and flourished in the 1950s. Local painters, graphic artists and sculptors,
trained under the unified Soviet system of artist education, began active work, often using national motifs in their art. The painters O.
Tansykbaev, J. Shardenov, K. Telzhanov, and S. Aitbaev, graphic artists E. Sidorkina and A. Duzelkhanov, and sculptors H. Nauryzbaeva
and E. Sergebaeva are today counted among the key figures of Kazakhstani art.
Cuisine
In the national cuisine, livestock meat, like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_meat"] horse meat[264] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef"] beef can be cooked in a variety of ways and is usually served with a wide
assortment of traditional bread products. Refreshments include black tea, often served with milk and dried fruits (such as dried apricots) and
nuts. In southern provinces, people often prefer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_tea"] green tea. Traditional milk-derived drinks such as ayran, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubat"] shubat and kymyz. A traditional
Kazakh dinner involves a multitude of appetisers on the table, followed by a soup and one or two main courses such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilaf"] pilaf and
beshbarmak. They also drink their national beverage, which consists of fermented mare's milk.[265]

Assandi-Times newspaper, saying it was a part of the Respublika group. Human Rights Watch said: "this absurd
case displays the lengths to which Kazakh authorities are willing to go to bully critical media into silence."[275]

procedure, concerning special guests, in such a way as to include Eurasian States. Two Council of Europe member
States, Turkey and Russia, belong geographically to both Europe and Asia and are therefore Eurasian. Strictly speaking,
the three South Caucasus States, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are located in Asia, yet their membership of political
Europe is no longer in doubt. [...] This being the case, Kazakhstan, as a Eurasian State participating in the OSCE and a
signatory to the International covenant on civil and political rights and the International covenant on economic, social and
cultural rights, would meet the criteria laid down in Rule 59, making it eligible to apply for special guest status with the
