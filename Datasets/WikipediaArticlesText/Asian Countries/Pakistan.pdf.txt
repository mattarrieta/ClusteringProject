Pakistan,[c] officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,[d] is a
country in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"] South Asia. It is the world's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population"] fifth-most populous country,
 with a population of almost 242 million, and has the world's second-
 largest Muslim population.[13] Pakistan is the 33rd-largest country by
area, spanning 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 square miles). It
has a 1,046-kilometre (650-mile) coastline along the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Sea"] Arabian Sea and
 Gulf of Oman in the south, and is bordered by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"] India to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93Pakistan_border"] the east,
 Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest, and China to the
northeast. It is separated narrowly from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan"] Tajikistan by Afghanistan's
 Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with
Oman.
Pakistan is the site of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Pakistan"] several ancient cultures, including the 8,500-
 year-old Neolithic site of Mehrgarh in Balochistan,[14] and the Indus
Valley Civilisation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age"] Bronze Age, the most extensive of the
civilisations of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Eurasia"] Afro-Eurasia.[15][16] The region that comprises the
modern state of Pakistan was the realm of multiple empires and
 dynasties, including the Achaemenid; briefly that of Alexander the
Great; the Seleucid, the Maurya, the Kushan, the Gupta;[17] the
 Umayyad Caliphate in its southern regions, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_Shahis"] Hindu Shahis, the

Spurred by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Movement"] Pakistan Movement, which sought a homeland for the
 Muslims of British India, and election victories in 1946 by the All-
India Muslim League, Pakistan gained independence in 1947 after the
 Partition of the British Indian Empire, which awarded separate
statehood to its Muslim-majority regions and was accompanied by an
unparalleled mass migration and loss of life.[19] Initially a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_Pakistan"] Dominion
 of the British Commonwealth, Pakistan officially drafted its
constitution in 1956, and emerged as a declared [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_republic"] Islamic republic. In
1971, the exclave of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Pakistan"] East Pakistan seceded as the new country of
 Bangladesh after a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War"] nine-month-long civil war. In the following four
decades, Pakistan has been ruled by governments whose descriptions,
although complex, commonly alternated between civilian and military,
democratic and authoritarian, relatively [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism_in_Pakistan"] secular and Islamist.[20]
Pakistan elected a civilian government in 2008, and in 2010 adopted a
 parliamentary system with periodic elections.[21]
Pakistan is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_power"] regional[22][23][24] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_power"] middle power nation,[25][26][27]
and has the world's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel"] sixth-largest standing armed forces. It is a declared
 nuclear-weapons state, and is ranked amongst the emerging and
growth-leading economies,[28] with a large and rapidly-growing
middle class.[29] Pakistan's political history since independence has
been characterised by periods of significant economic and military
growth as well as those of political and economic instability. It is an
 ethnically and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Pakistan"] linguistically diverse country, with similarly diverse
 geography and wildlife. The country continues to face challenges,
including poverty, illiteracy, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_Pakistan"] corruption and terrorism.[30] Pakistan is a

Etymology
The name [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Pakistan"] Pakistan literally means "land of the pure" or "land of purity", in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu"] Urdu and Persian.[31] It alludes to the word
 ‎پاک (pāk), meaning "pure" in Persian and Pashto.[32] The suffix [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%80%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86#Persian"] ‎ـستان (transliterated in English as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-stan"] -stan) is from Persian,
and means "land" or "place of".[33][34][35]
The name of the country was coined in 1933 by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choudhry_Rahmat_Ali"] Choudhry Rahmat Ali, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Movement"] Pakistan Movement activist, who published it in
a pamphlet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Declaration"] Now or Never, using it as an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym"] acronym ("thirty million Muslim brethren who live in PAKISTAN")[36] to refer
to the names of the five northern regions of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj"] British Raj: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Province_(British_India)"] Punjab, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North-West_Frontier_Province_(1901%E2%80%932010)"] Afghania, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(princely_state)"] Kashmir, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sind_Province_(1936%E2%80%9355)"] Sindh, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baluchistan_(Chief_Commissioner%27s_Province)"] Baluchistan.[36]
History
Early and medieval age
Indus Priest King Statue
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohenjo-Daro"] Mohenjo-Daro. 
Some of the earliest ancient human civilisations in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"] South Asia originated from areas
encompassing present-day Pakistan.[37] The earliest known inhabitants in the region were
 Soanian during the Lower Paleolithic, of whom stone tools have been found in the Soan
Valley of Punjab.[38] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_River"] Indus region, which covers most of present day Pakistan, was
the site of several successive ancient cultures including the Neolithic Mehrgarh[39] and the
Bronze Age [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilisation"] Indus Valley Civilisation[40][41] (2,800–1,800 BCE) at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harappa"] Harappa and
 Mohenjo-Daro.[42]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_period"] Vedic period (1500–500 BCE) was characterised by an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_peoples"] Indo-Aryan culture; during
this period the Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism, were composed, and
this culture later became well established in the region.[43] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multan"] Multan was an important Hindu
pilgrimage centre.[44] The Vedic civilisation flourished in the ancient [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhara"] Gandhāran city of
Takṣaśilā, now [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxila"] Taxila in the Punjab, which was founded around 1000 BCE.[45][39]
 Successive ancient empires and kingdoms ruled the region: the Persian Achaemenid
 Empire (around 519 BCE), Alexander the Great's empire in 326 BCE[46] and the Maurya
Page 4
 Empire, founded by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandragupta_Maurya"] Chandragupta Maurya and extended by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka_the_Great"] Ashoka the Great, until
185 BCE. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Greek_Kingdom"] Indo-Greek Kingdom founded by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demetrius_I_of_Bactria"] Demetrius of Bactria (180–165 BCE)
included Gandhara and Punjab and reached its greatest extent under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menander_I"] Menander (165–
150 BCE), prospering the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhism"] Greco-Buddhist culture in the region.[39][47] Taxila had one of
the earliest universities and centres of higher education in the world, which was
established during the late Vedic period in 6th century BCE.[48][49] The school consisted
of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious
instruction was provided on an individualistic basis.[49] The ancient university was
documented by the invading forces of Alexander the Great and was also recorded by
Chinese pilgrims in the 4th or 5th century CE.[50]
At its zenith, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_Dynasty"] Rai Dynasty (489–632 CE) of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindh"] Sindh ruled this region and the
surrounding territories.[51] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pala_Dynasty"] Pala Dynasty was the last Buddhist empire, which, under
 Dharmapala and Devapala, stretched across South Asia from what is now [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"] Bangladesh
through [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_India"] Northern India to Pakistan.
Islamic conquest

The Arab conqueror [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Qasim"] Muhammad ibn Qasim conquered Sindh in 711 CE.[52][53] The
Pakistan government's official chronology claims this as the time when the foundation of Pakistan was laid[52][54] but the
concept of Pakistan arrived in the 19th century. The Early Medieval period (642–1219 CE) witnessed the spread of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"] Islam
in the region. During this period, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufi"] Sufi [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawah"] missionaries played a pivotal role in converting a majority of the regional Buddhist
 and Hindu population to Islam.[55] Upon the defeat of the Turk and Hindu Shahi dynasties which governed the Kabul
 Valley, Gandhara (present-day Khyber Pakhtunkwa), and western Punjab in the 7th to 11th centuries CE, several
successive Muslim empires ruled over the region, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghaznavids"] Ghaznavid Empire (975–1187 CE), the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghorid"] Ghorid Kingdom,
and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate"] Delhi Sultanate (1206–1526 CE). The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodi_dynasty"] Lodi dynasty, the last of the Delhi Sultanate, was replaced by the Mughal
Empire (1526–1857 CE). 
The Mughals introduced Persian literature and high culture, establishing
the roots of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Persian_culture"] Indo-Persian culture in the region.[56] In the region of
modern-day Pakistan, key cities during the Mughal period were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore"] Lahore
and Thatta,[57] both of which were chosen as the site of impressive
 Mughal buildings.[58] In the early 16th century, the region remained
under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire"] Mughal Empire.[59]
 Badshahi Mosque, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore"] Lahore 
In the 18th century, the slow disintegration of the Mughal Empire was
 hastened by the emergence of the rival powers of the Maratha
 Confederacy and later the Sikh Empire, as well as invasions by Nader
Shah from Iran in 1739 and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durrani_Empire"] Durrani Empire of Afghanistan in 1759.
The growing political power of the British in Bengal had not yet reached
the territories of modern Pakistan.
Colonial period
None of the territory of modern Pakistan was ruled by the British, or other European powers, until 1839, when Karachi,
then a small fishing village with a mud fort guarding the harbour, was taken, and held as an enclave with a port and
 military base for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Afghan_War"] First Afghan War that soon followed. The rest of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindh"] Sindh was taken in 1843, and in the following
decades, first the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_East_India_Company"] East India Company, and then after the post-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepoy_Mutiny"] Sepoy Mutiny (1857–1858) direct rule of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria"] Queen Victoria of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire"] British Empire, took over most of the country partly through wars, and also treaties. The main wars were that against
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baloch_people"] Baloch [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talpur_dynasty"] Talpur dynasty, ended by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Miani"] Battle of Miani (1843) in Sindh, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Sikh_War_(disambiguation)"] Anglo-Sikh Wars (1845–1849) and the
 Anglo-Afghan Wars (1839–1919). By 1893, all modern Pakistan was part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Indian_Empire"] British Indian Empire, and remained so
until independence in 1947.
 Under the British, modern Pakistan was mostly divided into the Sind Division, Punjab Province, and the Baluchistan
Agency. There were various [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princely_state"] princely states, of which the largest was Bahawalpur.
Page 5
A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857"] rebellion in 1857 called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepoy_mutiny"] Sepoy mutiny of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal"] Bengal was the
region's major armed struggle against the British.[60] Divergence in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93Islamic_relations"] relationship between Hinduism and Islam created a major rift in
 British India that led to motivated religious violence in British
India.[61] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi%E2%80%93Urdu_controversy"] language controversy further escalated the tensions
between Hindus and Muslims.[62] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_Renaissance"] Hindu renaissance witnessed
an awakening of intellectualism in traditional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism"] Hinduism and saw the
emergence of more assertive influence in the social and political
spheres in British India.[63] A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aligarh_Movement"] Muslim intellectual movement,
founded by Sir [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syed_Ahmed_Khan"] Syed Ahmed Khan to counter the Hindu renaissance,
envisioned as well as advocated for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-nation_theory"] two-nation theory[64] and led
to the creation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-India_Muslim_League"] All-India Muslim League in 1906. In contrast
to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress"] Indian National Congress's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-British_sentiment"] anti-British efforts, the Muslim
League was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglomania"] pro-British movement whose political program
 inherited the British values that would shape Pakistan's future civil
society.[65] The largely non-violent independence struggle led by the
Indian Congress engaged millions of protesters in mass campaigns of
 civil disobedience in the 1920s and 1930s against the British
Empire.[66][67] 
Sir [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syed_Ahmad_Khan"] Syed Ahmad Khan
(1817–1898), whose
 vision formed the basis
of Pakistan 
 Muhammad Ali Jinnah
(1876–1948) served as
Pakistan's first
Governor-General and
the leader of the
 Pakistan Movement
The Muslim League slowly rose to mass popularity in the 1930s amid fears of
under-representation and neglect by the British of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Muslims"] Indian Muslims in politics.
In his presidential address of 29 December 1930, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal"] Allama Iqbal called for "the
amalgamation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_India"] North-West Muslim-majority Indian states" consisting of Punjab,
 North-West Frontier Province, Sind, and Baluchistan.[68] The perceived neglect of
Muslim interests by Congress led British [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1937_Indian_provincial_elections"] provincial governments during the period
of 1937–39 convinced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah"] Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan to espouse
the two-nation theory and led the Muslim League to adopt the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore_Resolution"] Lahore Resolution
of 1940 presented by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sher-e-Bangla"] Sher-e-Bangla [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.K._Fazlul_Haque"] A.K. Fazlul Haque, popularly known as the
 Pakistan Resolution.[64] In World War II, Jinnah and British-educated founding
fathers in the Muslim League supported the United Kingdom's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_in_World_War_II"] war efforts,
countering opposition against it whilst working towards Sir Syed's vision.[69]

The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1946_Indian_provincial_elections"] 1946 elections resulted in the Muslim League winning 90 percent of the seats reserved for Muslims. Thus, the 1946
election was effectively a plebiscite in which the Indian Muslims were to vote on the creation of Pakistan, a plebiscite won
by the Muslim League. This victory was assisted by the support given to the Muslim League by the support of the
landowners of Sindh and Punjab. The Indian National Congress, which initially denied the Muslim League's claim of
being the sole representative of Indian Muslims, was now forced to recognise the fact.[70] The British had no alternative
except to take Jinnah's views into account as he had emerged as the sole spokesperson of the entirety of British India's
Muslims. However, the British [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_the_partition_of_India"] did not want colonial India to be partitioned, and in one last effort to prevent it, they
devised the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Mission_Plan"] Cabinet Mission plan.[71]
As the cabinet mission failed, the British government announced its intention to end the British Rule in 1946–47.[72]
 Nationalists in British India—including Jawaharlal Nehru and Abul Kalam Azad of Congress, Jinnah of the All-India
Muslim League, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Tara_Singh"] Master Tara Singh representing the Sikhs—agreed to the proposed terms of transfer of power and
independence in June 1947 with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-General_of_India"] Viceroy of India, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma"] Lord Mountbatten of Burma.[73] As the United Kingdom agreed to
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India"] partitioning of India in 1947, the modern state of Pakistan was established on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_of_August"] 14 August 1947 (27th of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan"] Ramadan in 1366
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Calendar"] Islamic Calendar), amalgamating the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_India"] Muslim-majority eastern and northwestern regions of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_India"] British India.[67] It
comprised the provinces of Balochistan, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Bengal"] East Bengal, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North-West_Frontier_Province_(1901%E2%80%931955)"] North-West Frontier Province, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_Pakistan"] West Punjab, and Sindh.[64][73]
In the riots that accompanied the partition in Punjab Province, it is believed that between 200,000 and 2,000,000[74]
people were killed in what some have described as a retributive genocide between the religions[75] while 50,000 Muslim
women were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_women_during_the_partition_of_India"] abducted and raped by Hindu and Sikh men, 33,000 Hindu and Sikh women also experienced the same fate
Page 6
at the hands of Muslims.[76] Around 6.5 million Muslims moved from India to West Pakistan and 4.7 million Hindus and
Sikhs moved from West Pakistan to India.[77] It was the largest mass migration in human history.[78] A subsequent dispute
over the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princely_state"] princely state of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(princely_state)"] Jammu and Kashmir eventually sparked the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1947%E2%80%931948"] Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948.[79]
Independence and modern Pakistan
After [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_of_Pakistan"] independence in 1947, Jinnah, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_chair"] President of the Muslim League, became the
nation's first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor-General_of_Pakistan"] Governor-General as well as the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_National_Assembly_of_Pakistan"] President-Speaker of the Parliament,
but he died of tuberculosis on 11 September 1948.[80] Meanwhile, Pakistan's founding
fathers agreed to appoint [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaquat_Ali_Khan"] Liaquat Ali Khan, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General"] secretary-general of the party, the
nation's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Pakistan"] first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan"] Prime Minister. From 1947 to 1956, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Pakistan"] Pakistan was a monarchy within the
Commonwealth of Nations, and had two monarchs before it became a republic.[81]
The creation of Pakistan was never fully
accepted by many British leaders, among them
 Lord Mountbatten.[83] Mountbatten clearly
expressed his lack of support and faith in the
Muslim League's idea of Pakistan.[84] Jinnah
 Queen Elizabeth II was the last
monarch of independent
Pakistan, before it became a
republic in 1956. 
refused Mountbatten's  offer to serve as
 Governor-General of Pakistan.[85] When
Mountbatten was asked by Collins and
Lapierre if he would have sabotaged Pakistan
had he known that Jinnah was dying of
tuberculosis, he replied 'most probably'.[86] 
The American [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency"] CIA film on Pakistan
made in 1950 examines the history
and geography of Pakistan.
Maulana [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbir_Ahmad_Usmani"] Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, a respected Deobandi alim (scholar) who
occupied the position of Shaykh al-Islam in Pakistan in 1949,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abul_A%27la_Maududi"] Maulana Mawdudi of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaat-e-Islami"] Jamaat-i-Islami played a pivotal role
in the demand for an Islamic constitution. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abul_A%27la_Maududi"] Mawdudi demanded
that the Constituent Assembly make an explicit declaration
affirming the "supreme sovereignty of God" and the
supremacy of the shariah in Pakistan.[87] 
"You are free; you are free to go to your temples,
you are free to go to your mosques or to any other
place or worship in this State of Pakistan. You may
belong to any religion or caste or creed – that has
nothing to do with the business of the State."
A significant result of the efforts of the Jamaat-i-Islami and the
 ulama was the passage of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_Resolution"] Objectives Resolution in March
1949. The Objectives Resolution, which [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaquat_Ali_Khan"] Liaquat Ali Khan
called the second most important step in Pakistan's history, 
—[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali_Jinnah"] Muhammad Ali Jinnah's first speech to the
Constituent Assembly of Pakistan[82]
declared that "sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to
God Almighty alone and the authority which He has delegated
to the State of Pakistan through its people for being exercised within the limits prescribed by Him is a sacred trust". The
Objectives Resolution has been incorporated as a preamble to the constitutions of 1956, 1962, and 1973.[88]
 Democracy was stalled by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_Pakistani_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"] martial law that had been enforced by President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iskander_Mirza"] Iskander Mirza, who was replaced by the
 army chief, General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayub_Khan_(President_of_Pakistan)"] Ayub Khan. After adopting a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan_of_1962"] presidential system in 1962, the country experienced exceptional
growth until a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1965"] second war with India in 1965 that led to an economic downturn and wide-scale [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashkent_Agreement"] public disapproval in
1967.[89][90] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_Framework_Order,_1970"] Consolidating control from Ayub Khan in 1969, President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Khan"] Yahya Khan had to deal with a devastating
 cyclone that caused 500,000 deaths in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Pakistan"] East Pakistan.[91]
In 1970 Pakistan held its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Pakistani_general_election"] first democratic elections since independence, meant to mark a transition from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_Framework_Order,_1970"] military rule to
democracy, but after the East Pakistani [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League"] Awami League won against the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Peoples_Party"] Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Yahya Khan and
the military establishment refused to hand over power.[92][93] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Searchlight"] Operation Searchlight, a military crackdown on the Bengali
 nationalist movement, led to a declaration of independence and the waging of a war of liberation by the Bengali Mukti
Bahini forces in East Pakistan,[93][94] which in West Pakistan was described as a civil war as opposed to a war of
liberation.[95]
Independent researchers estimate that between 300,000 and 500,000 civilians died during this period while the
Bangladesh government puts the number of dead at three million,[96] a figure that is now nearly universally regarded as
excessively inflated.[97] Some academics such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_Rummel"] Rudolph Rummel and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounaq_Jahan"] Rounaq Jahan say both sides[98] committed
Page 7
genocide; others such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Richard_Sisson"] Richard Sisson and Leo E. Rose believe there was no
genocide.[99] In response to India's support for the insurgency in East Pakistan,
 preemptive strikes on India by Pakistan's air force, navy, and marines sparked a
conventional war in 1971 that resulted in an Indian victory and East Pakistan gaining
 independence as Bangladesh.[93]
With Pakistan [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_of_Surrender_(1971)"] surrendering in the war, Yahya Khan was replaced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulfikar_Ali_Bhutto"] Zulfikar Ali Bhutto
as president; the country worked towards promulgating [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan"] its constitution and putting the
country on the road to democracy. Democratic rule resumed from 1972 to 1977—an era of
self-consciousness, intellectual leftism, nationalism, and nationwide reconstruction.[100] In
1972 Pakistan embarked on an ambitious plan to develop its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_and_its_Nuclear_Deterrent_Program"] nuclear deterrence capability
with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutually_assured_destruction"] the goal of preventing any [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_interventionism"] foreign invasion; the country's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KANUPP"] first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant"] nuclear power plant
 was inaugurated in that same year.[101][102] Accelerated in response to India's first nuclear
test in 1974, this [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_and_Nuclear_Weapons"] crash program was completed in 1979.[102]
 Democracy ended with a military coup in 1977 against the leftist PPP, which saw General
Zia-ul-Haq become the president in 1978. From 1977 to 1988, President Zia's
 corporatisation and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamization_of_Economy"] economic Islamisation initiatives led to Pakistan becoming one of the
 fastest-growing economies in South Asia.[103] While building up the country's nuclear
program, increasing Islamisation,[104] and the rise of a homegrown [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_Pakistan"] conservative

 President Zia died in a plane crash in 1988, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benazir_Bhutto"] Benazir Bhutto, daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was elected as the
country's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Muslim_societies"] first female Prime Minister. The PPP was followed by conservative [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Muslim_League_(N)"] Pakistan Muslim League (N), and over the
next decade the leaders of the two parties fought for power, alternating in office while the country's situation worsened;
economic indicators fell sharply, in contrast to the 1980s. This period is marked by prolonged stagflation, instability,
corruption, nationalism, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostrategy"] geopolitical rivalry with India, and the clash of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_in_Pakistan"] left wing-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_Pakistan"] right wing ideologies.[107] As [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Muslim_League_(N)"] PML (N)

 Military tension between the two countries in the Kargil district led to the Kargil
 War of 1999, and turmoil in civic-military relations allowed General Pervez
Musharraf to take over through a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_Pakistani_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"] bloodless coup d'état.[109][110] Musharraf
governed Pakistan as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government"] chief executive from 1999 to 2001 and as President from

August 2008, and was succeeded by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asif_Ali_Zardari"] Asif Ali Zardari.[114] Clashes with the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan"] judicature prompted Gillani's disqualification from the Parliament and as the Prime
Minister in June 2012.[115] By its own financial calculations, Pakistan's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan%27s_role_in_the_War_on_Terror"] involvement in the war on terrorism has cost up to
$118 billion,[116] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents_in_Pakistan_since_2001"] sixty thousand casualties and more than 1.8 million displaced civilians.[117] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Pakistani_general_election"] general election held in

Khan lost a no-confidence vote in the parliament.[120]
Role of Islam
Page 8
Pakistan is the only country to have been created in the name of Islam.[121] The idea of Pakistan, which had received
overwhelming popular support among Indian Muslims, especially those in the provinces of British India where Muslims
were in a minority such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Provinces_(1937%E2%80%9350)"] United Provinces,[122] was articulated in terms of an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_state"] Islamic state by the Muslim League
leadership, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulama"] ulama (Islamic clergy) and Jinnah.[123] Jinnah had developed a close association with the ulama and upon
his death was described by one such alim, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maulana_Shabbir_Ahmad_Usmani"] Maulana Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, as the greatest Muslim after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurangzeb"] Aurangzeb and
as someone who desired to unite the Muslims of the world under the banner of Islam.[124]
The Objectives Resolution in March 1949, which declared God as the sole sovereign over the entire universe, represented
the first formal step to transform Pakistan into an Islamic state.[125][88] Muslim League leader [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaudhry_Khaliquzzaman"] Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman
asserted that Pakistan could only truly become an Islamic state after bringing all believers of Islam into a single political
unit.[126] Keith Callard, one of the earliest scholars on Pakistani politics, observed that Pakistanis believed in the essential
unity of purpose and outlook in the Muslim world and assumed that Muslim from other countries would share their views
on the relationship between religion and nationality.[127]
However, Pakistan's pan-Islamist sentiments for a united Islamic bloc called
Islamistan were not shared by other Muslim governments,[128] although Islamists
such as the Grand Mufti of Palestine, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amin_al-Husseini"] Al-Haj Amin al-Husseini, and leaders of the
 Muslim Brotherhood, became drawn to the country. Pakistan's desire for an
international organization of Muslim countries was fulfilled in the 1970s when the
 Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) was formed.[129]
The strongest opposition to the Islamist ideological paradigm being imposed on the
state came from the Bengali Muslims of East Pakistan[130] whose educated class,
according to a survey by social scientist Nasim Ahmad Jawed, preferred secularism
and focused on ethnic identity unlike educated West Pakistanis who tended to prefer
an Islamic identity.[131] The Islamist party [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaat-e-Islami"] Jamaat-e-Islami considered Pakistan to be
an Islamic state and believed Bengali nationalism to be unacceptable. In the 1971
conflict over East Pakistan, the Jamaat-e-Islami fought the Bengali nationalists on the
Pakistan Army's side.[132] The conflict concluded with East Pakistan seceding and
the creation of independent Bangladesh.
After Pakistan's first ever general elections, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan"] 1973 Constitution was created by an
elected Parliament.[133] The Constitution declared Pakistan an Islamic Republic and
Islam as the state religion. It also stated that all laws would have to be brought into 
The Friday Prayers at the
 Badshahi Mosque in Lahore
accordance with the injunctions of Islam as laid down in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran"] Quran and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnah"] Sunnah and that no law repugnant to such
injunctions could be enacted.[134] The 1973 Constitution also created certain institutions such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia"] Shariat Court and the
 Council of Islamic Ideology to channel the interpretation and application of Islam.[135]
Pakistan's leftist Prime Minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulfikar_Ali_Bhutto"] Zulfikar Ali Bhutto faced vigorous opposition which coalesced into a movement united
under the revivalist banner of Nizam-e-Mustafa ("Rule of the Prophet")[136] which aimed to establish an Islamic state
based on Sharia laws. Bhutto agreed to some Islamist demands before being overthrown in a coup.[137]
In 1977, after taking power from Bhutto in a coup d'état, General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq"] Zia-ul-Haq, who came from a religious
background,[138] committed himself to establishing an Islamic state and enforcing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia"] sharia law.[137] Zia established separate
Shariat judicial courts[139] and court benches[140] to judge legal cases using Islamic doctrine.[141] Zia bolstered the
influence of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulama"] ulama (Islamic clergy) and the Islamic parties.[141] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq"] Zia-ul-Haq forged a strong alliance between the
 military and Deobandi institutions[142] and even though most Barelvi ulama[143] and only a few Deobandi scholars had
supported Pakistan's creation, Islamic state politics came to be mostly in favour of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deobandi"] Deobandi (and later Ahl-e-
Hadith/Salafi) institutions instead of Barelvi.[144] Sectarian tensions increased with Zia's anti-Shia policies.[145]
According to a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center"] Pew Research Center (PEW) opinion poll, a majority of Pakistanis support making Sharia the official law
of the land.[146] In a survey of several Muslim countries, PEW also found that Pakistanis tend to identify with their
religion more than their nationality in contrast to Muslims in other nations such as Egypt, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"] Indonesia and Jordan.[147]
Geography, environment, and climate
Page 9
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Pakistan"] geography and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Pakistan"] climate of Pakistan are extremely diverse, and the country is
home to a wide variety of wildlife.[148] Pakistan covers an area of 881,913 km2
(340,509 sq mi), approximately equal to the combined land areas of France and the
United Kingdom. It is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_area"] 33rd-largest nation by total area, although this ranking
varies depending on how the disputed territory of Kashmir is counted. Pakistan has a
1,046 km (650 mi) coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the
south[149] and land borders of 6,774 km (4,209 mi) in total: 2,430 km (1,510 mi) with
Afghanistan, 523 km (325 mi) with China, 2,912 km (1,809 mi) with India and
909 km (565 mi) with Iran.[150] It shares a marine border with Oman,[151] and is
separated from Tajikistan by the cold, narrow [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakhan_Corridor"] Wakhan Corridor.[152] Pakistan
occupies a geopolitically important location at the crossroads of South Asia, the
Middle East, and Central Asia.[153]
Geologically, Pakistan is located in the Indus–Tsangpo Suture Zone and overlaps the
 Indian tectonic plate in its Sindh and Punjab provinces; Balochistan and most of
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are within the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_plate"] Eurasian plate, mainly on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_plateau"] Iranian plateau.
 Gilgit-Baltistan and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azad_Kashmir"] Azad Kashmir lie along the edge of the Indian plate and hence
are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_earthquakes_in_Pakistan"] prone to violent earthquakes. This region has the highest rates of
 seismicity and the largest earthquakes in the Himalaya region.[154]
Ranging from the coastal areas of the south to the glaciated mountains
of the north, Pakistan's landscapes vary from plains to deserts, forests,
hills, and plateaus.[155] 
A satellite image showing the
topography of Pakistan
Pakistan is divided into three major geographic areas: the northern
highlands, the Indus River plain, and the Balochistan Plateau.[156] The
northern highlands contain the Karakoram, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_Kush"] Hindu Kush, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamir_Mountains"] Pamir
mountain ranges (see [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountains_of_Pakistan"] mountains of Pakistan), which contain some of
 the world's highest peaks, including five of the fourteen eight-
thousanders (mountain peaks over 8,000 metres or 26,250 feet), which 
 Köppen climate classification of Pakistan
attract adventurers and mountaineers from all over the world, notably
 K2 (8,611 m or 28,251 ft) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanga_Parbat"] Nanga Parbat (8,126 m or 26,660 ft).[157] The Balochistan Plateau lies in the west and the
 Thar Desert in the east. The 1,609 km (1,000 mi) Indus River and its tributaries flow through the country from the
Kashmir region to the Arabian Sea. There is an expanse of alluvial plains along it in the Punjab and Sindh.[158]
The climate varies from tropical to temperate, with arid conditions in the coastal south. There is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon"] monsoon season with
frequent flooding due to heavy rainfall, and a dry season with significantly less rainfall or none at all. There are four
distinct seasons in Pakistan: a cool, dry winter from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through
May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon
period of October and November.[64] Rainfall varies greatly from year to year, and patterns of alternate flooding and
drought are common.[159]
Flora and fauna
The diversity of the landscape and climate in Pakistan allows a wide variety of trees and plants to flourish. The forests
range from coniferous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_plant"] alpine and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subalpine"] subalpine trees such as spruce, pine, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deodar_cedar"] deodar cedar in the extreme northern mountains
to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous"] deciduous trees in most of the country (for example, the mulberry-like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalbergia_sissoo"] shisham found in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulaiman_Mountains"] Sulaiman Mountains), to
palms such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut"] coconut and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_dactylifera"] date in the southern Punjab, southern Balochistan, and all of Sindh. The western hills are home
to juniper, tamarisk, coarse grasses, and scrub plants. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove"] Mangrove forests form much of the coastal wetlands along the coast
in the south.[160]
Coniferous forests are found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 4,000 metres (3,300 to 13,100 feet) in most of the northern
and northwestern highlands. In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeric"] xeric regions of Balochistan, date palm and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedra_(genus)"] Ephedra are common. In most of the
Punjab and Sindh, the Indus plains support tropical and subtropical dry and moist broadleaf forest as well as tropical and
xeric shrublands. These forests are mostly of mulberry, acacia, and eucalyptus.[161] About 2.2% or 1,687,000 hectares
(16,870 km2) of Pakistan was forested in 2010.[162]

The fauna of Pakistan also reflects the country's varied climate. Around 668 bird species
are found there,[163] including crows, sparrows, mynas, hawks, falcons, and eagles.
 Palas, Kohistan, has a significant population of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_tragopan"] western tragopan.[164] Many birds
sighted in Pakistan are migratory, coming from Europe, Central Asia, and India.[165]
The southern plains are home to mongooses, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Indian_civet"] small Indian civet, hares, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_jackal"] Asiatic jackal,
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_pangolin"] Indian pangolin, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_cat"] jungle cat, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_cat"] desert cat. There are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugger_crocodile"] mugger crocodiles in the
Indus, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar"] wild boar, deer, porcupines, and small rodents in the surrounding areas. The Bear
sandy scrublands of central Pakistan are home to Asiatic jackals, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striped_hyena"] striped hyenas, wildcats,
and leopards.[166][167] The lack of vegetative cover, the severe climate, and the impact of
grazing on the deserts have left wild animals in a precarious position. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinkara"] chinkara is the
only animal that can still be found in significant numbers in Cholistan. A small number of
 nilgai are found along the Pakistan–India border and in some parts of Cholistan.[166][168]
A wide variety of animals live in the mountainous north, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Polo_sheep"] Marco Polo sheep,
 the urial (a subspecies of wild sheep), the markhor goat, the ibex goat, the Asian black
bear, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayan_brown_bear"] Himalayan brown bear.[166][169][170] Among the rare animals found in the
area are the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_leopard"] snow leopard[169] and the blind [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_river_dolphin"] Indus river dolphin, of which there are 
Tibetan wolf
believed to be about 1,100 remaining, protected at the Indus River Dolphin Reserve in
Sindh.[169][171] In total, 174 mammals, 177 reptiles, 22 amphibians, 198 freshwater fish species and 5,000 species of
invertebrates (including insects) have been recorded in Pakistan.[163]
The flora and fauna of Pakistan suffer from a number of problems. Pakistan has the second-highest rate of deforestation in
 the world, which, along with hunting and pollution, has had adverse effects on the ecosystem. It had a 2019 Forest
Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.42/10, ranking it 41st globally out of 172 countries.[172] The government has
established a large number of protected areas, wildlife sanctuaries, and game reserves to address these issues.[163]
Government and politics
Pakistan's political experience is essentially related to the struggle of Indian
Muslims to regain the power they lost to British colonisation.[173] Pakistan is a
democratic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_republic"] parliamentary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_parliamentary_republic"] federal republic, with Islam as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion"] state religion.[4] The
 first constitution was adopted in 1956 but suspended by Ayub Khan in 1958, who
replaced it with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan_of_1962"] second constitution in 1962.[67] A complete and
comprehensive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan"] constitution was adopted in 1973, it was suspended by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq"] Zia-ul-Haq
in 1977 but reinstated in 1985. This constitution is the country's most important
document, laying the foundations of the current government.[150] The Pakistani
military establishment has played an influential role in mainstream politics [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Pakistan"] Parliament House
throughout [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_history_of_Pakistan"] Pakistan's political history.[67] The periods 1958–1971, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_Pakistani_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"] 1977–1988,
and 1999–2008 saw [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_coups_in_Pakistan"] military coups that resulted in the imposition of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law_in_Pakistan"] martial law and military commanders who governed
as de facto presidents.[174] Today Pakistan has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_system"] multi-party [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system"] parliamentary system with clear [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers"] division of powers and
 checks and balances among the branches of government. The first successful [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Pakistani_general_election"] democratic transition occurred in May 2013.
Politics in Pakistan is centred on, and dominated by, a homegrown [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_philosophy"] social philosophy comprising a blend of ideas from
socialism, conservatism, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_way"] third way. As of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Pakistani_general_election"] general elections held in 2013, the three main political parties in the
country are: the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-right_politics"] centre-right [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_Pakistan"] conservative [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Muslim_League_(N)"] Pakistan Muslim League-N; the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics"] centre-left [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism_in_Pakistan"] socialist PPP; and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_politics"] centrist and
third-way [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf"] Pakistan Movement for Justice (PTI).
 Head of State: The President, who is elected by an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_of_Pakistan"] Electoral College is the ceremonial head of the state
 and is the civilian commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Armed Forces (with the Chairman Joint Chiefs of
Staff Committee as principal military adviser), but military appointments and key confirmations in the
armed forces are made by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan"] Prime Minister after reviewing the reports on candidates' merit and
performance. Almost all appointed officers in the judicature, military, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff_Committee"] chairman joint chiefs, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff_Committee"] joint staff,
and legislature require the executive confirmation from the Prime Minister, whom the President must
consult by law. However, the powers to pardon and grant clemency lie with the President of Pakistan.
Legislative: The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameral"] bicameral legislature comprises a 104-member [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Pakistan"] Senate ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_House"] upper house) and a 342-member
 National Assembly (lower house). Members of the National Assembly are elected through the first-past-
the-post system under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_adult_suffrage"] universal adult suffrage, representing electoral districts known as National
Assembly constituencies. According to the constitution, the 70 seats reserved for women and religious
Page 11
minorities are allocated to the political parties according to their proportional representation. Senate
members are elected by provincial legislators, with all the provinces having equal representation.
Executive: The Prime Minister is usually the leader of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_rule"] majority rule
party or a coalition in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(Pakistan)"] National Assembly— the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house"] lower house. The
Prime Minister serves as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government"] head of government and is designated to
exercise as the country's chief executive. The Prime Minister is
responsible for appointing a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Pakistan"] cabinet consisting of ministers and advisers
as well as running the government operations, taking and authorising
 executive decisions, appointments and recommendations of senior civil
servants that require executive confirmation of the Prime Minister.
 Provincial governments: Each of the four provinces has a similar system
 Prime Minister's Office  of government, with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Pakistan"] directly elected [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Provincial_Assemblies_of_Pakistan"] Provincial Assembly in which the
leader of the largest party or coalition is elected [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Minister_(Pakistan)"] Chief Minister. Chief
Ministers oversee the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_provincial_governments_of_Pakistan"] provincial governments and head the provincial
cabinet. It is common in Pakistan to have different ruling parties or coalitions in each of the provinces. The
provincial bureaucracy is headed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Secretary_(Pakistan)"] Chief Secretary, who is appointed by the Prime Minister. The
provincial assemblies have power to make laws and approve the provincial budget which is commonly
presented by the provincial finance minister every fiscal year. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Governors_of_Pakistan"] Provincial governors who are the
ceremonial heads of the provinces are appointed by the President.[150]
Judicature: The judiciary of Pakistan is a hierarchical system with two
classes of courts: the superior (or higher) judiciary and the
subordinate (or lower) judiciary. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_Pakistan"] Chief Justice of Pakistan is the
 chief judge who oversees the judicature's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_system_of_Pakistan"] court system at all levels of
 command. The superior judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court
of Pakistan, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Shariat_Court"] Federal Shariat Court and five [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_courts_of_Pakistan"] high courts, with the
Supreme Court at the apex. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan"] Constitution of Pakistan entrusts the
superior judiciary with the obligation to preserve, protect and defend
the constitution. Other regions of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan
have separate court systems.

Foreign relations 
Since Independence, Pakistan has attempted to balance its relations with foreign
nations.[175] Pakistan is a strong ally of China, with both countries placing
considerable importance on the maintenance of an extremely close and supportive
 special relationship.[176] It has also been a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_non-NATO_ally"] major non-NATO ally of the United States
ever since the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_against_terrorism"] war against terrorism – a status achieved in 2004.[177] Pakistan's
 foreign policy and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_geostrategy"] geostrategy mainly focus on the economy and security against
threats to its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism_in_Pakistan"] national identity and territorial integrity, and on the cultivation of close
relations with other Muslim countries.[178]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict"] Kashmir conflict remains the major point of contention between Pakistan and
India; three of their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_conflicts"] four wars were fought over this territory.[179] Due partly to
difficulties in relations with its geopolitical rival India, Pakistan maintains close
political relations with Turkey and Iran,[180] and both countries have been a focal
point in Pakistan's foreign policy.[180] Saudi Arabia also maintains a respected
position in Pakistan's foreign policy.
President of Pakistan [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayub_Khan_(general)"] Ayub Khan A non-signatory party of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons"] Treaty on Nuclear Non-Proliferation, Pakistan is an
 with US President John F.
Kennedy in 1961 
influential member of the IAEA.[181] In recent events, Pakistan has blocked an
 international treaty to limit [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissile_material"] fissile material, arguing that the "treaty would target
Pakistan specifically".[182] In the 20th century, Pakistan's nuclear deterrence program
focused on countering India's nuclear ambitions in the region, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhran-II"] nuclear tests by
India eventually led Pakistan to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan%27s_nuclear_testing_series"] reciprocate to maintain a geopolitical balance as becoming a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Pakistan"] nuclear power.[183]
Currently, Pakistan maintains a policy of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-deterrence"] credible minimum deterrence, calling its program vital [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_and_its_Nuclear_Deterrent_Program"] nuclear deterrence against
foreign aggression.[184][185]
Page 12
Located in the strategic and geopolitical corridor of the world's major maritime oil supply lines and communication fibre
optics, Pakistan has proximity to the natural resources of Central Asian countries.[186] Briefing on the country's foreign
policy in 2004, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Senate"] Pakistani senator reportedly explained: "Pakistan highlights sovereign equality of states, bilateralism,
mutuality of interests, and non-interference in each other's domestic affairs as the cardinal features of its foreign
policy."[187] Pakistan is an active member of the United Nations and has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_Representative_of_Pakistan_to_the_United_Nations"] Permanent Representative to represent
Pakistan's positions in international politics.[188] Pakistan has lobbied for the concept of "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightened_moderation"] enlightened moderation" in the
 Muslim world.[189] Pakistan is also a member of Commonwealth of Nations,[190] the South Asian Association for
 Regional Cooperation (SAARC),  the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO),[191] and the G20 developing
nations.[192]
Due to ideological differences, Pakistan opposed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"] Soviet Union in the 1950s.
During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War"] Soviet–Afghan War in the 1980s, Pakistan was one of the closest allies
of the United States.[187][193] Relations between Pakistan and Russia have greatly
improved since 1999, and co-operation in various sectors has increased.[194]
Pakistan has had an "on-and-off" relationship with the United States. A close ally
of the United States during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War"] Cold War, Pakistan's relationship with the US
soured in the 1990s when the latter [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressler_amendment"] imposed sanctions because of Pakistan's
secretive nuclear development.[195] Since [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks"] 9/11, Pakistan has been a close ally of
the US on the issue of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism"] counterterrorism in the regions of the Middle East and
South Asia, with the US supporting Pakistan with aid money and
weapons.[196][197] Initially, the US-led war on terrorism led to an improvement in 
Pakistani Prime Minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan"] Imran Khan
 at the 2019 Shanghai Cooperation
Organisation summit
the relationship, but it was strained by a divergence of interests and resulting
mistrust during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present)"] war in Afghanistan and by issues related to terrorism.[198] The Pakistani intelligence agency, the ISI,
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_and_state-sponsored_terrorism"] was accused of supporting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban"] Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan.[199][200][201]
Pakistan does not have [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan-Israel_relations"] diplomatic relations with Israel;[202] nonetheless, some Israeli citizens have visited the country on
tourist visas.[203] However, an exchange took place between the two countries using Turkey as a communication
conduit.[204] Despite Pakistan being the only country in the world that has not established [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia%E2%80%93Pakistan_relations"] diplomatic relations with
Armenia, an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenians_in_Pakistan"] Armenian community still resides in Pakistan.[205] Pakistan had warm relations with Bangladesh, despite
some initial strains in their relationship.
Relations with China
Pakistan was one of the first countries to establish formal diplomatic relations with the
 People's Republic of China, and the relationship continues to be strong since China's
 war with India in 1962, forming a special relationship.[207] From the 1960s to 1980s,
Pakistan greatly helped China in reaching out to the world's major countries and
helped facilitate US President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon"] Richard Nixon's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972_Nixon_visit_to_China"] state visit to China.[207] Despite the
change of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan"] governments in Pakistan and fluctuations in the regional and global
situation, China's policy in Pakistan continues to be a dominant factor at all
times.[207] In return, China is Pakistan's largest trading partner, and economic co-
operation has flourished, with substantial Chinese investment in Pakistan's
infrastructural expansion such as the Pakistani deep-water port at Gwadar. Friendly
Sino-Pakistani relations reached new heights as both countries signed 51 agreements
and Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) in 2015 for co-operation in different
areas.[208] Both countries signed a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93Pakistan_Free_Trade_Agreement"] Free Trade Agreement in the 2000s, and Pakistan
continues to serve as China's communication bridge to the Muslim world.[209] In
2016, China announced that it will set up an anti-terrorism alliance with Pakistan,
Afghanistan, and Tajikistan.[210] In December 2018, Pakistan's government defended
China's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang_re-education_camps"] re-education camps for a million [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghurs"] Uyghur Muslims.[211][212]
Emphasis on relations with Muslim world
After Independence, Pakistan vigorously pursued bilateral relations with other
Muslim countries[213] and made an active bid for leadership of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world"] Muslim world, or
at least for leadership in efforts to achieve unity.[214] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maulana_Muhammad_Ali_Jauhar"] Ali brothers had sought to

project Pakistan as the natural leader of the Islamic world, in part due to its large manpower and military strength.[215] A
top-ranking [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Muslim_League"] Muslim League leader, Khaliquzzaman, declared that Pakistan would bring together all Muslim countries into
Islamistan – a pan-Islamic entity.[216]
 Such developments (along with Pakistan's creation) did not get American approval, and British Prime Minister Clement
Attlee voiced international opinion at the time by stating that he wished that India and Pakistan would re-unite.[217] Since
most of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world"] Arab world was undergoing a nationalist awakening at the time, there was little attraction to Pakistan's Pan-
Islamic aspirations.[218] Some of the Arab countries saw the 'Islamistan' project as a Pakistani attempt to dominate other
Muslim states.[219]
Pakistan vigorously championed the right of self-determination for Muslims around the world. Pakistan's efforts for the
independence movements of Indonesia, Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and Eritrea were significant and initially led to close
ties between these countries and Pakistan.[220] However, Pakistan also masterminded an attack on the Afghan city of
 Jalalabad during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Civil_War_(1989%E2%80%9392)"] Afghan Civil War to establish an Islamic government there. Pakistan had wished to foment an 'Islamic
Revolution' that would transcend national borders, covering Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Central Asia.[221]
 On the other hand, Pakistan's relations with Iran have been strained at times due to sectarian tensions.[222] Iran and Saudi
Arabia used Pakistan as a battleground for their proxy sectarian war, and by the 1990s Pakistan's support for the Sunni
Taliban organisation in Afghanistan became a problem for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia"] Shia Iran, which opposed a Taliban-controlled
Afghanistan.[223] Tensions between Iran and Pakistan intensified in 1998 when Iran accused Pakistan of war crimes after
Pakistani warplanes had bombarded Afghanistan's last Shia stronghold in support of the Taliban.[224]
Pakistan is an influential and founding member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation"] Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Maintaining cultural,
political, social, and economic relations with the Arab world and other countries in the Muslim world is a vital factor in
Pakistan's foreign policy.[225]

A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_parliamentary_republic"] federal parliamentary republic state, Pakistan is a federation that comprises [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Provinces_(Pakistan)"] four provinces: Punjab, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and Balochistan,[226] and three territories: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad_Capital_Territory"] Islamabad Capital Territory, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad
Kashmir. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan"] Government of Pakistan exercises the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto_standard"] de facto jurisdiction over the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_Regions"] Frontier Regions and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Kashmir"] western parts
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_Region"] Kashmir Regions, which are organised into the separate political entities Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan
(formerly Northern Areas). In 2009, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan"] constitutional assignment (the Gilgit–Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance
Order) awarded the Gilgit-Baltistan a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Pakistan"] semi-provincial status, giving it self-government.[227]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Pakistan"] local government system consists of a three-tier system of districts, tehsils, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Councils_of_Pakistan"] union councils, with an elected body at
each tier.[228] There are about 130 districts altogether, of which Azad Kashmir has ten[229] and Gilgit-Baltistan seven.[230]

 Law enforcement is carried out by a joint network of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Intelligence_Community"] intelligence community with jurisdiction limited to the relevant
province or territory. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Intelligence_Directorate_(Pakistan)"] National Intelligence Directorate coordinates the information intelligence at both federal and
provincial levels; including the FIA, IB, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highways_and_Motorway_Police"] Motorway Police, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary_forces_of_Pakistan"] paramilitary forces such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Rangers"] Pakistan Rangers and the
 Frontier Corps.[231]
Pakistan's "premier" intelligence agency, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence"] Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), was formed just within a year after the
Independence of Pakistan in 1947.[232] ABC News Point in 2014 reported that the ISI was ranked as the top intelligence
agency in the world[233] while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zee_News"] Zee News reported the ISI as ranking fifth among the world's most powerful intelligence
agencies.[234]
 The court system is organised as a hierarchy, with the Supreme Court at the apex, below which are high courts, Federal
Shariat Courts (one in each province and one in the federal capital), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_courts_of_Pakistan"] district courts (one in each district), Judicial Magistrate
Courts (in every town and city), Executive Magistrate Courts, and civil courts. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_penal_code"] Penal code has limited jurisdiction in
the Tribal Areas, where law is largely derived from tribal customs.[231][235]
Kashmir conflict
 Kashmir, a Himalayan region situated at the northernmost point of the Indian
 subcontinent, was governed as an autonomous princely state known as Jammu and
Kashmir in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj"] British Raj prior to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India"] Partition of India in August 1947. Following
the independence of India and Pakistan post-partition, the region became the subject
of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir_conflict"] major territorial dispute that has hindered [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93Pakistan_relations"] their bilateral relations. The two states
have engaged each other in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_conflicts"] two large-scale wars over the region in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1947%E2%80%931948"] 1947–1948 and

region in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siachen_conflict"] 1984 and 1999.[179] Approximately 45.1% of the Kashmir region is
controlled by India (administratively split into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)"] Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh),
which also claims the entire territory of the former princely state of Jammu and
Kashmir that is not under its control.[179] India's control over Jammu and Kashmir
and Ladakh as well as its claim to the rest of the region has likewise been contested
by Pakistan, which controls approximately 38.2% of the region (administratively split
into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azad_Kashmir"] Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit−Baltistan) and claims all of the territory
under Indian control.[179][236] Additionally, approximately 20% of the region has

 Sino-Indian War of 1962 and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Pakistan_Agreement"] Sino-Pakistani Agreement of 1963.[237] The Chinese-controlled areas of Kashmir
remain subject to an Indian territorial claim, but are not claimed by Pakistan.
India claims the entire Kashmir region on the basis of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_of_Accession_(Jammu_and_Kashmir)"] Instrument of Accession—a legal agreement with the princely
state of Jammu and Kashmir that was executed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja_Hari_Singh"] Hari Singh, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja"] maharaja of the state, who agreed to cede the entire area
to newly-independent India.[238] Pakistan claims most of Kashmir on the basis of its Muslim-majority population and of its
geography, the same principles that were applied for the creation of the two independent states.[239] India referred the
dispute to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"] United Nations on 1 January 1948.[240] In a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_38"] resolution passed in 1948, the UN's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly"] General Assembly asked

Pakistan to remove most of its military troops to set the conditions for the holding
of a plebiscite. However, Pakistan failed to vacate the region and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi_Agreement"] ceasefire was
reached in 1949 establishing a ceasefire line known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_Control"] Line of Control (LoC)
that divided Kashmir between the two states as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto"] de facto border.[241] India,
fearful that the Muslim-majority populace of Kashmir would vote to secede from
India, did not allow a plebiscite to take place in the region. This was confirmed in
a statement by India's Defense Minister, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._K._Krishna_Menon"] Krishna Menon, who stated: "Kashmir
would vote to join Pakistan and no Indian Government responsible for agreeing to

Kashmir.  Pakistan claims that its position is for the right of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiris"] Kashmiri people to determine
their future through impartial elections as mandated by the United Nations,[243]
while India has stated that Kashmir is an "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhand_Bharat"] integral part" of India, referring to the
 1972 Simla Agreement and to the fact that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Jammu_and_Kashmir"] regional elections take place regularly.[244] In recent developments, certain
Kashmiri independence groups believe that Kashmir should be independent of both India and Pakistan.[179]
Law enforcement
 The law enforcement in Pakistan is carried out by joint network of several federal and provincial police agencies. The four
provinces and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad_Capital_Territory"] Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) each have a civilian police force with jurisdiction extending only to
the relevant province or territory.[150] At the federal level, there are a number of civilian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Intelligence_Community"] intelligence agencies with
nationwide jurisdictions including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Investigation_Agency"] Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_Bureau_(Pakistan)"] Intelligence Bureau (IB), as well as
several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary_forces_of_Pakistan"] paramilitary forces such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_of_Pakistan"] National Guards ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Areas_of_Pakistan"] Northern Areas), the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Rangers"] Rangers (Punjab and Sindh), and the
 Frontier Corps (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan).
The most senior officers of all the civilian police forces also form part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Service_of_Pakistan"] Police Service, which is a component of the
 civil service of Pakistan. Namely, there is four provincial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Service_of_Pakistan"] police service including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Police_(Pakistan)"] Punjab Police, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindh_Police"] Sindh Police,

 has its own police component, the Capital Police, to maintain law and order in the capital. The CID bureaus are the crime
investigation unit and form a vital part in each provincial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Service_of_Pakistan"] police service.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_Pakistan"] law enforcement in Pakistan also has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highways_%26_Motorway_Police"] Motorway Patrol which is responsible for enforcement of traffic and safety
laws, security and recovery on Pakistan's inter-provincial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorways_of_Pakistan"] motorway network. In each of provincial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Service_of_Pakistan"] Police Service, it also
maintains a respective [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_Police"] Elite Police units led by the NACTA—a counter-terrorism police unit as well as providing VIP
escorts. In the Punjab and Sindh, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Rangers"] Pakistan Rangers are an internal security force with the prime objective to provide
and maintain security in war zones and areas of conflict as well as maintaining law and order which includes providing
assistance to the police.[245] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier_Corps"] Frontier Corps serves the similar purpose in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa"] Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and the

Military history
Since 1947 Pakistan has been involved in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_wars_and_conflicts"] four [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_warfare"] conventional wars. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1947%E2%80%931948"] The first occurred in Kashmir with Pakistan gaining
control of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Kashmir"] Western Kashmir, (Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan), and India retaining [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Kashmir"] Eastern Kashmir (Jammu and
 Kashmir and Ladakh). Territorial problems eventually led to another conventional war in 1965. The issue of Bengali
refugees led to another war in 1971 which resulted in Pakistan's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_Instrument_of_Surrender"] unconditional surrender in East Pakistan.[260] Tensions in
Kargil brought the two countries at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1999"] brink of war.[109] Since 1947 the unresolved [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durand_Line"] territorial problems with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan"] Afghanistan
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_intelligence_community"] saw border skirmishes which were kept mostly at the mountainous border. In 1961, the military and intelligence
community repelled the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_Pakistan#Pakistan-Afghanistan_border_clash_of_1961"] Afghan incursion in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bajaur_Agency"] Bajaur Agency near the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durand_Line"] Durand Line border.[261]

For
 almost two weeks Saudi Special Forces and Pakistani commandos fought the insurgents who had occupied the Grand
Mosque's compound.[268] In 1991, Pakistan became involved with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War"] Gulf War and sent 5,000 troops as part of a US-led
coalition, specifically for the defence of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia"] Saudi Arabia.[269]
Despite the UN arms embargo on Bosnia, General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javed_Nasir"] Javed Nasir of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence"] ISI airlifted anti-tank weapons and missiles to
Bosnian mujahideen which turned the tide in favour of Bosnian Muslims and forced the Serbs to lift the siege. Under
Nasir's leadership the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence"] ISI was also involved in supporting Chinese Muslims in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang"] Xinjiang Province, rebel Muslim groups in
the Philippines, and some religious groups in Central Asia.[270]
Since 2004, the military has been engaged in an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_North-West_Pakistan"] insurgency in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, mainly against the
 Tehrik-i-Taliban factions.[271] Major operations undertaken by the army include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Black_Thunderstorm"] Operation Black Thunderstorm,

The structure of the Pakistani economy has changed from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Pakistan"] a mainly agricultural to a
strong service base. Agriculture as of 2015 accounts for only 20.9% of the GDP.[313]
Even so, according to the United Nations [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization"] Food and Agriculture Organization,
Pakistan produced 21,591,400 metric tons of wheat in 2005, more than all of Africa
(20,304,585 metric tons) and nearly as much as all of South America (24,557,784
metric tons).[314] Majority of the population, directly or indirectly, is dependent on
this sector. It accounts for 43.5% of employed labour force and is the largest source of
foreign exchange earnings.[313][315]  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_mining"] Surface mining in Sindh.
A large portion of the country's manufactured exports is dependent on raw materials
such as cotton and hides that are part of the agriculture sector, while supply shortages
and market disruptions in farm products do push up inflationary pressures. The

country is also the fifth-largest producer of cotton, with cotton production of
14 million bales from a modest beginning of 1.7 million bales in the early 1950s; is self-sufficient in sugarcane; and is the
fourth-largest producer in the world of milk. Land and water resources have not risen proportionately, but the increases
have taken place mainly due to gains in labour and agriculture productivity. The major breakthrough in crop production
took place in the late 1960s and 1970s due to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution"] Green Revolution that made a significant contribution to land and yield
increases of wheat and rice. Private tube wells led to a 50 percent increase in the cropping intensity which was augmented
by tractor cultivation. While the tube wells raised crop yields by 50 percent, the High Yielding Varieties (HYVs) of wheat
and rice led to a 50–60 percent higher yield.[316] Meat industry accounts for 1.4 percent of overall GDP.[317]
Industry
Industry is the second-largest sector of the economy, accounting for 19.74% of gross
domestic product (GDP),  and 24 percent of total employment. Large-scale
manufacturing (LSM), at 12.2% of GDP, dominates the overall sector, accounting for
66% of the sectoral share, followed by small-scale manufacturing, which accounts for
4.9% of total GDP. Pakistan's cement industry is also fast growing mainly because of
demand from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan"] Afghanistan and from the domestic real estate sector. In 2013 Pakistan
exported 7,708,557 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tons"] metric tons of cement.[319] Pakistan has an installed capacity of
44,768,250 metric tons of cement and 42,636,428 metric tons of clinker. In 2012 and
2013, the cement industry in Pakistan became the most profitable sector of the
economy.[320]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_industry_in_Pakistan"] textile industry has a pivotal position in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan. In
Asia, Pakistan is the eighth-largest exporter of textile products, contributing 9.5% to
the GDP and providing employment to around 15 million people (some 30% of the
49 million people in the workforce). Pakistan is the fourth-largest producer of cotton
with the third-largest spinning capacity in Asia after China and India, contributing 5%
to the global spinning capacity.[321] China is the second largest buyer of Pakistani

textiles, importing US$1.527 billion of textiles last fiscal. Unlike the US, where
mostly value-added textiles are imported, China buys only cotton yarn and cotton fabric from Pakistan. In 2012, Pakistani
textile products accounted for 3.3% or US$1.07bn of all UK textile imports, 12.4% or $4.61bn of total Chinese textile
imports, 3.0% of all US textile imports ($2,980 million), 1.6% of total German textile imports ($880 million) and 0.7% of
total Indian textile imports ($888 million).[322]

Services
The services sector makes up 58.8% of GDP[313] and has emerged as
the main driver of economic growth.[323] Pakistani society like other
developing countries is a consumption oriented society, having a high
marginal propensity to consume. The growth rate of services sector is
higher than the growth rate of agriculture and industrial sector. Services
sector accounts for 54 percent of GDP in 2014 and little over one-third Rising skyline of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi"] Karachi with several under

the fastest growing sector's in Pakistan. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum"] World Economic Forum, assessing the development of Information and
Communication Technology in the country ranked Pakistan 110th among 139 countries on the 'Networked Readiness
Index 2016'.[325]
As of May 2020, Pakistan has about 82 million internet users, making it the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_Internet_users"] 9th-largest population of Internet users in the
world.[326][327] The current growth rate and employment trend indicate that Pakistan's Information Communication
Technology (ICT) industry will exceed the $10-billion mark by 2020.[328] The sector employees 12,000 and count's
among top five freelancing nations.[329] The country has also improved its export performance in telecom, computer and
information services, as the share of their exports surged from 8.2pc in 2005–06 to 12.6pc in 2012–13. This growth is
much better than that of China, whose share in services exports was 3pc and 7.7pc for the same period respectively.[330]
Tourism
With its diverse cultures, people, and landscapes, Pakistan attracted around
6.6 million foreign tourists in 2018,[331] which represented a significant decline
since the 1970s when the country received unprecedented numbers of foreign
tourists due to the popular [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie_trail"] Hippie trail. The trail attracted thousands of Europeans
and Americans in the 1960s and 1970s who travelled via land through Turkey and
Iran into India through Pakistan.[332] The main destinations of choice for these
tourists were the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pass"] Khyber Pass, Peshawar, Karachi, Lahore, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swat_(Pakistan)"] Swat and

Nuclear power and energy
As of May 2021, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Pakistan"] nuclear power is provided by six licensed commercial
 nuclear power plants.[342] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Atomic_Energy_Commission"] Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC)
 is solely responsible for operating these power plants, while the Pakistan
Nuclear Regulatory Authority regulates safe usage of the nuclear energy.[343]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation"] electricity generated by commercial nuclear power plants constitutes
 roughly 5.8% of Pakistan's electrical energy, compared to 64.2% from fossil
fuels ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_oil"] crude oil and natural gas), 29.9% from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectric_power"] hydroelectric power, and 0.1%
from coal.[344][345] Pakistan is one of the four [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons"] nuclear armed states (along
 with India, Israel, and North Korea) that is not a party to the Nuclear Non-
 Proliferation Treaty, but it is a member in good standing of the International
Atomic Energy Agency.[346] 
 Tarbela Dam, the largest earth filled dam
in the world, was constructed in 1968.
 The KANUPP-I, a Candu-type nuclear reactor, was supplied by Canada in 1971—the country's first commercial nuclear
power plant. The Sino-Pakistani nuclear cooperation began in the early 1980s. After a Sino-Pakistani nuclear cooperation
agreement in 1986,[347] China provided Pakistan with a nuclear reactor dubbed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chashma_Nuclear_Power_Plant"] CHASNUPP-I for energy and the
industrial growth of the country. In 2005 both countries proposed working on a joint energy security plan, calling for a
huge increase in generation capacity to more than 160,000 MWe by 2030. Under its Nuclear Energy Vision 2050, the
Pakistani government plans to increase nuclear power generation capacity to 40,000 MWe,[348] 8,900 MWe of it by
2030.[349]
In June 2008 the nuclear [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chashma_Nuclear_Power_Plant"] commercial complex was expanded with the ground
work of installing and operationalising the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chashma_Nuclear_Power_Plant"] Chashma-III and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chashma_Nuclear_Power_Plant"] Chashma–IV reactors
at Chashma, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_(Pakistani_province)"] Punjab Province, each with 325–340 MWe and costing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_rupee"] ₨
129 billion; from which the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_rupee"] ₨ 80 billion came from international sources,
principally China. A further agreement for China's help with the project was
 signed in October 2008, and given prominence as a counter to the US–India
agreement that shortly preceded it. The cost quoted then was US$1.7 billion, with
a foreign loan component of US$1.07 billion. In 2013 Pakistan established a
second commercial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi_Nuclear_Power_Complex"] nuclear complex in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi"] Karachi with plans of additional reactors,
similar to the one in Chashma.[351] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_in_Pakistan"] electrical energy is generated by various
 energy corporations and evenly distributed by the National Electric Power
Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) among the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Provinces_(Pakistan)"] four provinces. However, the Karachi-
based [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-Electric"] K-Electric and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_and_Power_Development_Authority"] Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA)
generates much of the electrical energy used in Pakistan in addition to gathering
revenue nationwide.[352] In 2014, Pakistan had an installed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation"] electricity generation
capacity of ~22,797[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megawatt"] MWt.[344] 
Pakistan produced 1,135 megawatts
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy"] renewable energy for the month of
October 2016. Pakistan expects to
produce 3,000 megawatts of
renewable energy by the beginning of
2019.[350]
Transport
The transport industry accounts for ~10.5% of the nation's GDP.[353]
Motorways
 Motorways of Pakistan are a network of multiple-lane, high-speed, controlled-
access highways in Pakistan, which are owned, maintained, and operated federally
by Pakistan's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Authority"] National Highway Authority. As of 20 February 2020, 1882 km of
motorways are operational, while an additional 1854 km are under construction or
planned. All motorways in Pakistan are pre-fixed with the letter 'M' (for
"Motorway") followed by the unique numerical designation of the specific
highway (with a hyphen in the middle), e.g. "M-1".[354]
Pakistan's motorways are an important part of Pakistan's "National Trade Corridor
Project",[355] which aims to link Pakistan's three [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Sea"] Arabian Sea ports ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi_Port"] Karachi Port,
 Port Bin Qasim and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwadar_Port"] Gwadar Port) to the rest of the country through its national

motorways, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highways_of_Pakistan"] national highways, and expressways.
Highways
Highways form the backbone of Pakistan's transport system; a total road length of 263,942 kilometres (164,006 miles)
accounts for 92% of passengers and 96% of inland freight traffic. Road transport services are largely in the hands of the
 private sector. The National Highway Authority is responsible for the maintenance of national highways and motorways.
The highway and motorway system depends mainly on north–south links connecting the southern ports to the populous
provinces of Punjab and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa"] Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Although this network only accounts for 4.6% of total road length,[313] it
carries 85% of the country's traffic.[356][357]
Railways
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Railways"] Pakistan Railways, under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Railways_(Pakistan)"] Ministry of Railways (MoR),  operates the
railroad system. From 1947 until the 1970s the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Railways"] train system was the primary
means of transport until the nationwide constructions of the national highways and
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_boom"] economic boom of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cars_in_Pakistan"] automotive industry. Beginning in the 1990s there was
a marked shift in traffic from rail to highways; dependence grew on roads after the
introduction of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_Pakistan"] vehicles in the country. Now the railway's share of inland traffic is
below 8% for passengers and 4% for freight traffic.[313] As personal transportation
began to be dominated by the automobile, total rail track decreased from 8,775 
 Karachi Cantonment railway station
kilometres (5,453 miles) in 1990–91 to 7,791 kilometres (4,841 miles) in
2011.[356][358] Pakistan expects to use the rail service to boost [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_trade_of_Pakistan"] foreign trade with China, Iran, and Turkey.[359]
Airports
There are an estimated 151 airports and airfields in Pakistan as of 2013—including both the military and the mostly
publicly owned [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Authority_(Pakistan)"] civilian airports.[3] Although [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinnah_International_Airport"] Jinnah International Airport is the principal international gateway to
Pakistan, the international airports in Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, Quetta, Faisalabad, Sialkot, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multan_International_Airport"] Multan also handle
significant amounts of traffic.
 The civil aviation industry is mixed with public and private sectors, which was deregulated in 1993. While the state-
owned [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_International_Airlines"] Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is the major and dominant air carrier that carries about 73% of domestic
passengers and all domestic freight, the private airlines such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airblue"] airBlue and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Indus"] Air Indus, also provide similar services at a
 low cost.
Seaports
Major seaports are in Karachi, Sindh (the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Karachi"] Karachi port, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Qasim"] Port Qasim).[356][358]
Since the 1990s some seaport operations have been moved to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan,_Pakistan"] Balochistan with the
 construction of Gwadar Port, Port of Pasni and Gadani Port.[356][358] Gwadar
Port is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_water_port"] deepest sea port of the world.[360] According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum"] WEF's Global
Competitiveness Report, quality ratings of Pakistan's port infrastructure increased
from 3.7 to 4.1 between 2007 and 2016.[361]

Other Systems
 Karachi Circular Railway is a partially active regional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport"] public transit system in Karachi, which serves the
 Karachi metropolitan area. KCR was fully operational between 1969 and 1999. Since 2001, restoration of
the railway and restarting the system had been sought.[374] In November 2020, the KCR partially revived
operations.[375]
A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamedali_Tramways_Company"] tramway service was started in 1884 in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi"] Karachi but was closed in 1975 due to various factors.[376] The
 Sindh Government is planning to restart the tramway services in the city, collaborating with Austrian
experts.[377]
In October 2019, a project for the construction of tramway service in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore"] Lahore has also been signed by the
 Punjab Government. This project will be launched under public-private partnership in a joint venture of
European and Chinese companies along with the Punjab transport department.[378]
Flyovers and underpasses
Many flyovers and underpasses are located in major urban areas of the country to
segregate the flow of traffic. The highest number of flyovers and under passes are
located in Karachi, followed by Lahore.[379] Other cities having flyovers and
underpasses for the regulation of flow of traffic includes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad-Rawalpindi_metropolitan_area"] Islamabad-Rawalpindi,

Education
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pakistan"] constitution of Pakistan requires the state to provide [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_education"] free primary and secondary education.[408]
At the time of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_of_Pakistan"] establishment of Pakistan as a state, the country had only one
university, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Punjab"] Punjab University in Lahore.[409] Very soon the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan"] Pakistan government
 established public universities in each of the four provinces, including Sindh

 Balochistan University (1970). Pakistan has a large network of both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_universities"] public and
 private universities, which includes collaboration between the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_in_Pakistan"] universities aimed at
providing research and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_in_Pakistan"] higher education opportunities in the country, although
there is concern about the low quality of teaching in many of the newer
 schools.[410] It is estimated that there are 3,193 technical and vocational
institutions in Pakistan,[411] and there are also [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrassas_in_Pakistan"] madrassahs that provide free [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sargodha"] Central Library of University of
Islamic education and offer free board and lodging to students, who come mainly Sargodha
from the poorer strata of society.[412] Strong public pressure and popular criticism
over [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Taleban"] extremists' usage of madrassahs for recruitment, the Pakistan government has
made repeated efforts to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_reform"] regulate and monitor the quality of education in the madrassahs.[413]
 Education in Pakistan is divided into six main levels: nursery
(preparatory classes);  primary (grades one through five);  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school"] middle
(grades six through eight); [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_(upper_secondary)"] matriculation (grades nine and ten, leading

leading to a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Secondary_(School)_Certificate"] higher secondary certificate); and university programmes
leading to graduate and postgraduate degrees.[411] There is a network
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools_in_Pakistan"] private schools that constitutes a parallel secondary education
 system based on a curriculum set and administered by the Cambridge
International Examinations of the United Kingdom. Some students
choose to take the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_Level"] O-level and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCE_Advanced_Level"] A level exams conducted by the

Demographics
Page 25
Pakistan had a population of 213,222,917 according to the final
results of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Census_of_Pakistan"] 2017 Census of Pakistan.[427][428][429] This figure
 includes Pakistan's four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad
 Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan. Pakistan is the world's fifth-most
populated country.[430]
Between 1951 and 2017, Pakistan's population expanded over
sixfold, going from 33.7 million to 207.7 million. The country has a
relatively high, although declining, growth rate supported by high
birth rates and low death rates. Between 1998 and 2017, the average
annual population growth rate stood at +2.40%.
Dramatic social changes have led to urbanisation and the emergence Historical population of Pakistan
of two megacities: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi"] Karachi and Lahore. The country's urban
population more than tripled between 1981 and 2017 (from 23.8
million to 75.7 million, as Pakistan's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization"] urbanization rate rose from 28.2% to 36.4%. Even with this, the nation's urbanization
rate remains one of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization_by_country"] the lowest in the world, and in 2017, over 130 million Pakistanis (making up nearly 65% of the
population) lived in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area"] rural areas.
Due to a high [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate"] fertility rate, estimated at 3.5 in 2022, Pakistan has one of the world's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_median_age"] youngest populations. The 2017
census recorded that 40.3% of the country's population was under the age of 15, while only 3.7% of Pakistanis were aged
65 or more.[431] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_age"] median age of the country was 19,[431] while its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_ratio"] sex ratio was recorded to be 105 males per 100

 Because of this, Pakistan has a multicultural, multilinguistic, and multiethnic society. Despite Urdu being Pakistan's lingua
franca, estimates on how many languages are spoken in the country range from 75 to 85,[432][433] and in 2017, the
country's three largest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnolinguistic_group"] ethnolinguistic groups were the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabis"] Punjabis (making up 38.8% of the total population), the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtuns"] Pashtuns

 provincial languages. Urdu—the lingua franca and a symbol of Muslim
identity and national unity—is the national language and understood by over
75% of Pakistanis. It is the main medium of communication in the country,

colony, Ziaul Haq Colony, and Godhra Camp.[449]
Thousands of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghurs"] Uyghur Muslims have also migrated to the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan, fleeing religious and cultural
persecution in Xinjiang, China.[450] Since 1989 thousands of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmiris"] Kashmiri Muslim refugees have sought refuge in Pakistan,

Urbanisation
Since [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_Pakistan"] achieving independence as a result of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India"] partition of India, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanisation_in_Pakistan"] urbanisation
has increased exponentially, with several different causes. The majority of the
population in the south resides along the Indus River, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi"] Karachi the most
populous commercial city.[456] In the east, west, and north, most of the population
lives in an arc formed by the cities of Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Islamabad,
Sargodha, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Jhelum, Sheikhupura, Nowshera, Mardan,
and Peshawar. During the period 1990–2008, city dwellers made up 36% of
Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in South Asia.
Furthermore, more than 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or
more.[457] Immigration, from both within and outside the country, is regarded as 
 Kalma Underpass, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore"] Lahore
one of the main factors contributing to urbanisation in Pakistan. One analysis of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_Pakistan_Census"] 1998 national census highlighted the
Page 27
significance of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India"] partition of India in the 1940s as it relates to urban change in Pakistan.[458]During and after the
independence period, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhajir_(Urdu-speaking_people)"] Urdu speaking Muslims from India migrated in large numbers to Pakistan, especially to the port city
of Karachi, which is today the largest metropolis in Pakistan. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_to_Pakistan"] Migration from other countries, mainly from those nearby,
has further accelerated the process of urbanisation in Pakistani cities. Inevitably, the rapid urbanisation caused by these
large population movements has also created new political and socio-economic challenges. In addition to immigration,
economic trends such as the green revolution and political developments, among a host of other factors, are also important
causes of urbanisation.[458]

officially considered non-Muslims by virtue of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_Constitution_of_Pakistan"] constitutional amendment.[477] The
 Ahmadis are particularly persecuted, especially since 1974 when they were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_Constitution_of_Pakistan"] banned from
calling themselves Muslims. In 1984, Ahmadiyya places of worship were banned from
 being called "mosques".[478] As of 2012, 12% of Pakistani Muslims self-identify as non-
denominational Muslims.[479] There are also several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quraniyoon"] Quraniyoon communities.[480]
They are mainly concentratd in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalian_Tehsil"] Lalian Tehsil, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiniot_District"] Chiniot District, where approximately
13% of the population.[481]
Sufism, a mystical Islamic tradition, has a long history and a large following among the Sunni Muslims in Pakistan, at both
the academic and popular levels. Popular Sufi culture is centered around gatherings and celebrations at the shrines of saints
 and annual festivals that feature Sufi music and dance. Two Sufis whose shrines receive much national attention are Ali
Hajweri in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore"] Lahore (c. 12th century)[482] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahbaz_Qalander"] Shahbaz Qalander in Sehwan, Sindh (c. 12th century).[483]
There are two levels of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism"] Sufism in Pakistan. The first is the 'populist' Sufism of the rural population. This level of Sufism
involves belief in intercession through saints, veneration of their shrines, and forming bonds (Mureed) with a pir (saint).
Many rural Pakistani Muslims associate with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pir_(Sufism)"] pirs and seek their intercession.[484] The second level of Sufism in Pakistan
is 'intellectual Sufism', which is growing among the urban and educated population. They are influenced by the writings of
Sufis such as the medieval theologian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ghazali"] al-Ghazali, the Sufi reformer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaykh_Ahmad_Sirhindi"] Shaykh Aḥmad Sirhindi, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Wali_Allah"] Shah Wali Allah.[485]
Contemporary Islamic fundamentalists criticise Sufism's popular character, which in their view does not accurately reflect
the teachings and practice of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad"] Muhammad and his companions.[486]
Hinduism 
 Hinduism is the second-largest
religion in Pakistan after Islam and is
followed by 2.14% of the population
according to the 2017 census.[5][488]
According to the 2010 Pew report,
Pakistan had the fifth-largest Hindu
population in the world.[489] In the
Hindu Proportion of each Pakistani District
in 2017 according to the Pakistan Bureau
of Statistics 
2017 census, the Hindu population
was found to be 4,444,437.[490]
Hindus are found in all provinces of
Pakistan but are mostly concentrated
in Sindh, where they account for
 8.73% of the population.[5] Umerkot

 Mirpurkhas and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanghar_District"] Sanghar hosts more than half of the Hindu population in Pakistan.[481]
At the time of Pakistan's creation, the 'hostage theory' gained currency. According to this theory, the Hindu minority in
Pakistan was to be given a fair deal in Pakistan in order to ensure the protection of the Muslim minority in India.[491]
However, Khawaja Nazimuddin, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Pakistan"] second [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Pakistan"] Prime Minister of Pakistan, stated:
Page 29
I do not agree that religion is a private affair of the individual nor do I agree that in an Islamic state every
citizen has identical rights, no matter what his caste, creed or faith be.[492]
Some Hindus in Pakistan feel that they are treated as second-class citizens and many have continued to migrate to
 India.[467] Pakistani Hindus faced riots after the Babri Masjid demolition[493] and have experienced other attacks, forced
conversions, and abductions.[494]
Christianity and other religions
Christians formed the next largest religious minority after Hindus, with 1.27% of
the population following it.[436] The highest concentration of Christians in
 Pakistan is in Lahore District (5%) in Punjab province and in Islamabad Capital
Territory (over 4% Christian). There is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_Pakistan"] Roman Catholic community in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi"] Karachi
that was established by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa"] Goan and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_people"] Tamil migrants when Karachi's infrastructure

Culture and society
 Civil society in Pakistan is largely hierarchical, emphasising local cultural
etiquette and traditional Islamic values that govern personal and political life.
The basic family unit is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_family"] extended family,[497] although for socio-
 economic reasons there has been a growing trend towards nuclear
 families.[498] The traditional dress for both men and women is the Shalwar
Kameez; trousers, jeans, and shirts are also popular among men.[44] In recent
decades, the middle class has increased to around 35 million and the upper 
Christian Proportion of each Pakistani
District in 2017 according to the Pakistan
Bureau of Statistics
and upper-middle classes to around 17 million, and power is shifting from
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_ul-Fitr"] rural landowners to the urbanised elites.[499] Pakistani festivals, including Eid-ul-
Fitr, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Adha"] Eid-ul-Azha, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan"] Ramazan,  Christmas, Easter, Holi, and Diwali, are mostly
religious in origin.[497] Increasing globalisation has resulted in Pakistan ranking
56th on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.T._Kearney"] A.T. Kearney/FP [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization_Index"] Globalization Index.[500]
Clothing, arts, and fashion
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalwar_kameez"] Shalwar Kameez is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_dress"] national dress of Pakistan and is worn by both men
 and women in all four provinces: Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber- [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck_art_in_Pakistan"] Truck art is a distinctive feature of
Pakhtunkhwa, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azad_Kashmir"] Azad Kashmir. Each province has its own style of Shalwar Pakistani culture.
Kameez. Pakistanis wear clothes in a range of exquisite colours and designs and in
type of fabric (silk, chiffon, cotton, etc.). Besides the national dress, domestically
tailored [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suit_(clothing)"] suits and neckties are often worn by men, and are customary in offices, schools, and social gatherings.[501]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_fashion"] fashion industry has flourished in the changing environment of the fashion world. Since Pakistan came into being, its
fashion has evolved in different phases and developed a unique identity. Today, Pakistani fashion is a combination of
traditional and modern dress and has become a mark of Pakistani culture. Despite modern trends, regional and traditional
forms of dress have developed their own significance as a symbol of native tradition. This regional fashion continues to
 evolve into both more modern and purer forms. The Pakistan Fashion Design Council based in Lahore organizes PFDC
Fashion Week and the Fashion Pakistan Council based in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachi"] Karachi organizes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion_Pakistan_Week"] Fashion Pakistan Week. Pakistan's first
fashion week was held in November 2009.[502]

Media and entertainment
The private [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspapers_in_Pakistan"] print media, state-owned [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Television_Corporation"] Pakistan Television Corporation (PTV), and
 Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Pakistan"] radio were the dominant media
outlets until the beginning of the 21st century. Pakistan now has a large network of
domestic, privately owned 24-hour [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_channels_in_Pakistan"] news media and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_in_Pakistan"] television channels.[503] A
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Freedom_Index"] 2016 report by the Reporters Without Borders ranked Pakistan 147th on the Press
Freedom Index, while at the same time terming the Pakistani media "among the
freest in Asia when it comes to covering the squabbling among politicians."[504]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC"] BBC terms the Pakistani media "among the most outspoken in South
Asia".[505] Pakistani media has also played a vital role in exposing
corruption.[506]

 Neelum District
The Lollywood, Kariwood, Punjabi and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashto_cinema"] Pashto film industry is based in Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar. While
 Bollywood films were banned from public cinemas from 1965 until 2008, they have remained an important part of
popular culture.[507] In contrast to the ailing Pakistani film industry, Urdu [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_dramas"] televised dramas and theatrical performances
 continue to be popular, as many entertainment media outlets air them regularly.[508] Urdu dramas dominate the television
entertainment industry, which has launched critically acclaimed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries"] miniseries and featured popular actors and actresses since
the 1990s.[509] In the 1960s–1970s, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_pop_music"] pop music and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Deewane"] disco (1970s) dominated the country's music industry. In the 1980s–
 1990s, British influenced rock music appeared and jolted the country's entertainment industry.[510] In the 2000s, heavy
metal music gained popular and critical acclaim.[511]
Pakistani music ranges from diverse forms of provincial folk music and traditional styles such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qawwali"] Qawwali and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazal"] Ghazal
Gayaki to modern musical forms that fuse traditional and western music.[512][513] Pakistan has many famous folk singers.
The arrival of Afghan refugees in the western provinces has stimulated interest in Pashto music, although there has been
intolerance of it in some places.[514]
Diaspora
According to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Pakistan has the sixth-largest diaspora in the
world.[455] Statistics gathered by the Pakistani government show that there are around 7 million [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pakistan_people&action=edit&redlink=1"] Pakistanis residing
abroad, with the vast majority living in the Middle East, Europe, and North America.[515] Pakistan ranks 10th in the world
for remittances sent home.[307][516] The largest inflow of remittances, as of 2016, is from Saudi Arabia, amounting to
 $5.9 billion.[517] The term Overseas Pakistani is officially recognised by the Government of Pakistan. The Ministry of
Overseas Pakistanis was established in 2008 to deal exclusively with all matters of overseas Pakistanis such as attending to
their needs and problems, developing projects for their welfare, and working for resolution of their problems and issues.
Overseas Pakistanis are the second-largest source of foreign exchange remittances to Pakistan after exports. Over the last
several years, home remittances have maintained a steadily rising trend, with a more than 100% increase from
US$8.9 billion in 2009–10 to US$19.9 billion in 2015–16.[306][516]
The Overseas Pakistani Division (OPD) was created in September 2004 within the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Labour_(Pakistan)"] Ministry of Labour (MoL). It has since
recognised the importance of overseas Pakistanis and their contribution to the nation's economy. Together with
Community Welfare Attaches (CWAs) and the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF), the OPD is making efforts to
improve the welfare of Pakistanis who reside abroad. The division aims to provide better services through improved
facilities at airports, and suitable schemes for housing, education, and health care. It also facilitates the reintegration into
 society of returning overseas Pakistanis. Notable members of the Pakistani diaspora include the London Mayor Sadiq
 Khan, the UK cabinet member Sajid Javid, the former UK Conservative Party chair Baroness Warsi, the singers Zayn

Literature and philosophy
Pakistan has literature in Urdu, Sindhi, Punjabi, Pashto, Baluchi, Persian, English, and many other languages.[518] The
 Pakistan Academy of Letters is a large literary community that promotes literature and poetry in Pakistan and abroad.[519]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Library_of_Pakistan"] National Library publishes and promotes literature in the country. Before the 19th century, Pakistani literature
Page 31
consisted mainly of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyric_poetry"] lyric and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufi_poetry"] religious poetry and mystical and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_folklore"] folkloric works. During the
colonial period, native literary figures were influenced by western [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_realism"] literary realism and took up
increasingly varied topics and narrative forms. Prose fiction is now very popular.[520][521]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_poets"] national poet of Pakistan, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal"] Muhammad Iqbal, wrote
poetry in Urdu and Persian. He was a strong proponent
of the political and spiritual revival of Islamic
civilisation and encouraged Muslims all over the world
to bring about a successful revolution.[523] Well-known
figures in contemporary Pakistani Urdu literature
 Muhammad Iqbal,
Pakistan's national
poet who conceived
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conception_of_Pakistan"] idea of Pakistan 
 include Josh Malihabadi Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Saadat
Hasan Manto. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadequain"] Sadequain and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulgee"] Gulgee are known for
their calligraphy and paintings.[521] The Sufi poets
 Shah Abdul Latif, Bulleh Shah, Mian Muhammad
Bakhsh, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khawaja_Farid"] Khawaja Farid enjoy considerable
popularity in Pakistan.[524] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Kalich_Beg"] Mirza Kalich Beg has been
termed the father of modern Sindhi prose.[525] Historically, philosophical
development in the country was dominated by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Iqbal"] Muhammad Iqbal, Sir Syed Ahmad
Khan, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Asad"] Muhammad Asad, Maududi, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Ali_Jouhar"] Mohammad Ali Johar.[526] 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Shah_Rukn-e-Alam"] Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam is
part of Pakistan's Sufi heritage.[522]
 Ideas from British and American philosophy greatly shaped philosophical development in Pakistan. Analysts such as M.
M. Sharif and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syed_Zafarul_Hasan"] Zafar Hassan established the first major Pakistani philosophical movement in 1947.[527] After the 1971 war,
philosophers such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalaludin_Abdur_Rahim"] Jalaludin Abdur Rahim, Gianchandani, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik_Meraj_Khalid"] Malik Khalid incorporated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism"] Marxism into Pakistan's
philosophical thinking. Influential work by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzoor_Ahmad"] Manzoor Ahmad, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Elia"] Jon Elia, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasan_Askari_Rizvi"] Hasan Askari Rizvi, and Abdul Khaliq brought

influenced philosophical ideas in various fields of social and political philosophy.[529]
Architecture
Four periods are recognised in Pakistani architecture: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Pakistan#Early_history"] pre-Islamic, Islamic,
colonial, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Pakistan#Independence"] post-colonial. With the beginning of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_civilization"] Indus civilization around the
middle of the 3rd millennium BCE,[530] an advanced urban culture developed for
the first time in the region, with large buildings, some of which survive to this
day.[531] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohenjo-daro"] Mohenjo Daro, Harappa, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kot_Diji"] Kot Diji are among the pre-Islamic
settlements that are now tourist attractions.[157] The rise of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism"] Buddhism and the
influence of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_campaign_of_Alexander_the_Great"] Greek civilisation led to the development of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Buddhism"] Greco-Buddhist
style,[532] starting from the 1st century CE. The high point of this era was the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandara_art"] Gandhara style. An example of Buddhist architecture is the ruins of the Buddhist
monastery [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takht_Bhai"] Takht-i-Bahi in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.[533] 
 Minar-e-Pakistan is a national
monument marking Pakistan's
independence movement.
The arrival of Islam in what is today Pakistan meant the sudden end of Buddhist
architecture in the area and a smooth transition to the predominantly pictureless [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_architecture"] Islamic architecture. The most important
 Indo-Islamic-style building still standing is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rukn-e-Alam"] tomb of the Shah Rukn-i-Alam in Multan. During the Mughal era, design
elements of Persian-Islamic architecture were fused with and often produced playful forms of Hindustani art. Lahore, as
the occasional residence of Mughal rulers, contains many important buildings from the empire. Most prominent among
 them are the Badshahi Mosque, the fortress of Lahore with the famous Alamgiri Gate, the colourful, Mughal-style Wazir
Khan Mosque,[534] the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalimar_Gardens_(Lahore)"] Shalimar Gardens in Lahore, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahjahan_Mosque"] Shahjahan Mosque in Thatta. In the British colonial period,
predominantly functional buildings of the Indo-European representative style developed from a mixture of European and
Indian-Islamic components. Post-colonial national identity is expressed in modern structures such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisal_Mosque"] Faisal Mosque,
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minar-e-Pakistan"] Minar-e-Pakistan, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazar-e-Quaid"] Mazar-e-Quaid. Several examples of architectural infrastructure demonstrating the influence
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_the_United_Kingdom"] British design can be found in Lahore, Peshawar, and Karachi.[535]
Food and drink
Traditional food
Page 32
Pakistani cuisine is similar to that of other regions of South Asia, with some of it
being originated from the royal kitchens of 16th-century Mughal emperors.[537]
 Most of those dishes have their roots in British, Indian, Central Asian and Middle
Eastern cuisine.[538] Unlike Middle Eastern cuisine, Pakistani cooking uses large
quantities of spices, herbs, and seasoning. Garlic, ginger, turmeric, red chili, and
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garam_masala"] garam masala are used in most dishes, and home cooking regularly includes curry,
 roti, a thin flatbread made from wheat, is a staple food, usually served with curry,
meat, vegetables, and lentils. Rice is also common; it is served plain, fried with
spices, and in sweet dishes.[153][539]
 Lassi is a traditional drink in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_region"] Punjab region. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_tea_culture"] Black tea with milk and sugar is
popular throughout Pakistan and is consumed daily by most of the
population.[44][540] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sohan_halwa"] Sohan halwa is a popular sweet dish from the southern region
of Punjab province and is enjoyed all over Pakistan.[541]

largest food streets of Asia.[536]
Sports
Most sports played in Pakistan originated and were substantially developed by athletes and sports fans from the United
Kingdom who introduced them during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj"] British Raj. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_hockey"] Field hockey is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sport"] national sport of Pakistan; it has won three gold
medals in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games"] Olympic Games held in 1960, 1968, and 1984.[542] Pakistan has also won the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_World_Cup"] Hockey World Cup a record
four times, held in 1971, 1978, 1982, and 1994.[543]
Cricket, however, is the most popular game across the country.[544] The country
has had an array of success in the sport over the years, and has the distinct
achievement of having won each of the major [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council"] ICC international cricket
 tournaments: ICC Cricket World Cup, ICC World Twenty20, and ICC Champions
Trophy; as well as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Test_Championship"] ICC Test Championship.[545] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_national_cricket_team"] cricket team (known as

1999. Pakistan was runner-up in the inaugural [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_ICC_World_Twenty20"] World Twenty20 (2007) in South
Africa and won the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_ICC_World_Twenty20"] World Twenty20 in England in 2009. In March 2009,
militants [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_attack_on_the_Sri_Lanka_national_cricket_team"] attacked the touring [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team"] Sri Lankan cricket team,[546] after which no
international cricket was played in Pakistan until May 2015, when the
 Zimbabwean team agreed to a tour. Pakistan also won the 2017 ICC Champions
Trophy by defeating arch-rivals [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team"] India in the final.
 Pakistan Super League is one of the largest cricket leagues of the world with a
brand value of about ₨32.26 billion (US$200 million).[547] 
 Gaddafi Stadium, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore"] Lahore is the 3rd
largest cricket stadium in Pakistan
with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seating_capacity"] seating capacity of 27,000
spectators.
 Association Football is the second most played sports in Pakistan and it is organised and regulated by the Pakistan
Football Federation.[548] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Pakistan"] Football in Pakistan is as old as the country itself. Shortly after the creation of Pakistan in 1947,
the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) was created, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah became its first Patron-in-Chief.[549] The
highest football division in Pakistan is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Premier_League"] Pakistan Premier League.[550] Pakistan is known as one of the best

6500 BCE – 200 CE, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge_University_Press"] Cambridge University Press Quote: ""Mehrgarh remains one of the key sites in
South Asia because it has provided the earliest known undisputed evidence for farming and pastoral
communities in the region, and its plant and animal material provide clear evidence for the ongoing
manipulation, and domestication, of certain species. Perhaps most importantly in a South Asian context,
the role played by zebu makes this a distinctive, localised development, with a character completely
different to other parts of the world. Finally, the longevity of the site, and its articulation with the
neighbouring site of Nausharo (c. 2800—2000 BCE), provides a very clear continuity from South Asia's
first farming villages to the emergence of its first cities (Jarrige, 1984)."
15. Wright 2009, pp. 1–2:Quote: "The Indus civilisation is one of three in the 'Ancient East' that, along with
Mesopotamia and Pharaonic Egypt, was a cradle of early civilisation in the Old World (Childe, 1950).
Mesopotamia and Egypt were longer lived, but coexisted with Indus civilisation during its florescence
between 2600 and 1900 B.C. Of the three, the Indus was the most expansive, extending from today's
northeast Afghanistan to Pakistan and India."

development begins to become apparent in the greater Indus system, which we can now see to be a
formative stage underlying the Mature Indus of the middle and late third millennium. This development
seems to have involved the whole Indus system, and to a lesser extent the Indo-Iranian borderlands to its
west, but largely left untouched the subcontinent east of the Indus system."

the real turning point for the new Muslim League came with the general election of December 1945 and
January 1946. Despite facing a rejuvenated Congress, the League won four-fifths of all the Muslim-
reserved seats ... The result left no one, not least the British, in doubt about where the locus of power
within the Muslim community now lay (p. 71) ... In most respects, therefore, the League's success in the
elections of 1945–46 can be interpreted as a clear Muslim mandate for Pakistan. (p 72)"

of life was immense, with estimates ranging from several hundred thousand up to a million. But, even for
those who survived, fear generated a widespread perception that one could be safe only among members
of one's own community; and this in turn helped consolidate loyalties towards the state, whether India or
Pakistan, in which one might find a secure haven. This was especially important for Pakistan, where the
succour it offered to Muslims gave that state for the first time a visible territorial reality. Fear too drove
forward a mass migration unparalleled in the history of South Asia. ... Overall, partition uprooted some
12.5 million of undivided India's people."

Jordan's definition of middle powers, we argue that Pakistan is in fact a middle power despite its being
nuclear-armed. When looking at the numbers, for instance, it appears that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan can

became a republic upon independence on 15 August 1947. Instead, all three of these South Asian states
began their independent life as Realms within the British Commonwealth and mirrored the style and
institutions of the Dominions of Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. Though their
sovereignty was in no way impaired by this seemingly ambiguous position they all held the British
sovereign as their head of state who was represented in each capital by a governor- general appointed on

Congress. While doing so he clearly expressed his lack of support and faith in the Muslim League and its
Pakistan idea."

was asked by Collins and Lapierre if he would have sabotaged Pakistan if he had known that Jinnah was
dying of tuberculosis, his answer was instructive. There was no doubt in his mind about the legality or

(scholar) who was appointed to the prestigious position of Shaykh al-Islām of Pakistan in 1949, was the
first to demand that Pakistan become an Islamic state. But Mawdūdī and his Jamāʿat-i Islāmī played the
central part in the demand for an Islamic constitution. Mawdūdī demanded that the Constituent Assembly
make an unequivocal declaration affirming the "supreme sovereignty of God" and the supremacy of the
sharīʿah as the basic law of Pakistan."

Islāmī and the ʿulamāʿ was the passage of the Objectives Resolution in March 1949, whose formulation
reflected compromise between traditionalists and modernists. The resolution embodied "the main
principles on which the constitution of Pakistan is to be based". It declared that "sovereignty over the
entire universe belongs to God Almighty alone and the authority which He has delegated to the State of
Pakistan through its people for being exercised within the limits prescribed by Him is a sacred trust", that
"the principles of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice, as enunciated by Islam shall
be fully observed", and that "the Muslims shall be enabled to order their lives in the individual and
collective spheres in accord with the teaching and requirements of Islam as set out in the Holy Qurʿan and
Sunna". The Objectives Resolution has been reproduced as a preamble to the constitutions of 1956,
1962, and 1973."

Western scholars of Pakistani politics, Keith Callard, observed that Pakistanis seemed to believe in the
essential unity of purpose and outlook in the Muslim world: Pakistan was founded to advance the cause
of Muslims. Other Muslims might have been expected to be sympathetic, even enthusiastic. But this
assumed that other Muslim states would take the same view of the relation between religion and
nationality."

conducted a survey of nationalism in pre-divided Pakistan and identifies the links between religion,
politics and nationalism in both wings of Pakistan. His findings are fascinating and go some way to
explain the differing attitudes of West and East Pakistan to the relationship between Islam and Pakistani
nationalism and how this affected the views of people in both wings, especially the views of the peoples
of both wings towards each other. In 1969, Jawed conducted a survey on the type of national identity that
was used by educated professional people. He found that just over 60% in the East wing professed to
have a secular national identity. However, in the West wing, the same figure professed an Islamic and not
a secular identity. Furthermore, the same figure in the East wing described their identity in terms of their
ethnicity and not in terms of Islam. He found that the opposite was the case in the West wing where Islam
was stated to be more important than ethnicity."

Khaliq-uz-Zaman, announced that Pakistan would bring all Muslim countries together into Islamistan – a
pan-Islamic entity. None of these developments within the new country elicited approval among
Americans for the idea of India's partition ... British Prime Minister Clement Attlee voiced the international
consensus at the time when he told the House of Commons of his hope that 'this severance may not
endure.' He hoped that the proposed dominions of India and Pakistan would in course of time, come
together to form one great Member State of the British Commonwealth of Nations."

year, Choudhry Khaliquzzaman toured the Middle East, pleading for the formation of an alliance or

Pakistani attempt to dominate other Muslim states."

creation of Pakistan made Pakistan the true leader of Muslim causes around the world led Pakistan's
diplomats to vigorously champion the cause of self-determination for fellow Muslims at the United
Nations. Pakistan's founders, including Jinnah, supported anti-colonial movements: "Our heart and soul
go out in sympathy with those who are struggling for their freedom ... If subjugation and exploitation are
carried on, there will be no peace and there will be no end to wars." Pakistani efforts on behalf of
Indonesia (1948), Algeria (1948–1949), Tunisia (1948–1949), Morocco (1948–1956) and Eritrea (1960–
1991) were significant and initially led to close ties between these countries and Pakistan."

Sunnis and Shias with the resultant rise in sectarian tensions in Pakistan. The rise of the Taliban in

Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has boycotted the census since 1974 which renders official Pakistani
figures to be inaccurate. Independent groups have estimated the Pakistani Ahmadiyya population to be
somewhere between 2 million and 5 million Ahmadis. However, the 4 million figure is the most quoted
figure and is approximately 2.2% of the country. See:
 over 2 million: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (4 December 2008). "Pakistan: The

populist Sufism of the rural masses, associated with unorthodox religious rituals and practices, belief in
the intercessory powers of saints, pilgrimage and veneration at their shrines, and a binding spiritual
relationship between the shaykh or pir (master) and murīd (disciple). Many Muslims in rural areas of
Pakistan, where orthodox Islam has yet to penetrate effectively, identify themselves with some pir, living or
dead, and seek his intercession for the solution of their worldly problems and for salvation in the
hereafter."

phenomenon based in urban areas and becoming increasingly popular in educated circles. Influenced by
the writings of the medieval theologian al-Ghazālī (d. 1111), the Sūfī reformer Shaykh Aḥmad Sirhindī
(d. 1624), and Shāh Walī Allāh (d. 1762), and by the spiritual experiences of the masters of the
Suhrawardī and Naqshbandī orders, these modern Sūfīs are rearticulating Islamic metaphysics as an
answer to Western materialism."
