Afghanistan,[c] officially the Islamic Emirate of
Afghanistan,[d] is a landlocked country located at the
crossroads of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"] Central and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"] South Asia. Referred to as the
 Heart of Asia,[22] it is bordered by Pakistan to the east
and south,[e] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"] Iran to the west, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmenistan"] Turkmenistan to the
northwest, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistan"] Uzbekistan to the north, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan"] Tajikistan to the
northeast, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"] China to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan%E2%80%93China_border"] northeast and east.
Occupying 652,864 square kilometers (252,072 sq mi)
of land, the country is predominately mountainous with
plains [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Turkestan"] in the north and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistan_Basin"] the southwest, which are
separated by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_Kush"] Hindu Kush mountain range. As of
2021, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Afghanistan"] its population is 40.2 million,[7] composed mostly
of ethnic Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazaras, and Uzbeks. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul"] Kabul
is the country's largest city and serves as its capital.
 Human habitation in Afghanistan dates back to the
 Middle Paleolithic era, and the country's strategic
location along the historic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road"] Silk Road has led it to being
described, picturesquely, as the ‘roundabout of the
 ancient world’.[23] Known as the Graveyard of
Empires,[24] the land has historically been home to
 various peoples and has witnessed numerous military
campaigns, including those by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great"] Alexander the Great, the
 Maurya Empire, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquests_of_Afghanistan"] Arab Muslims, the Mongols, the
 British, the Soviet Union, and most recently by an
American-led coalition. Afghanistan also served as the
source from which the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrian_Kingdom"] Greco-Bactrians and the
Mughals, among others, rose to form major empires.[25]
The various conquests and periods in both the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Iran"] Iranian
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_India"] Indian cultural spheres[26][27] made the area a
center for Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and
later Islam throughout history.[28]
The modern state of Afghanistan began with the
 Durrani dynasty in the 18th century, with the Durrani
Afghan Empire being formed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Shah_Durrani"] Ahmad Shah Durrani.
The Durrani Empire led conquests in which, at its peak,
encompassed land that spanned from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Iran"] eastern Iran to
 northern India.[29][30] Following its decline and the
death of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Shah_Durrani"] Ahmad Shah Durrani, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur_Shah_Durrani"] Timur Shah, it was
divided into multiple smaller independent kingdoms,
including but not limited to: Herat, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Qandahar"] Kandahar and
Kabul. Afghanistan would be reunited in the 19th
 century after wars of unification led by Dost
Mohammad Khan, where he conquered the 
Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan

independent principalities in Afghanistan. Dost
 Mohammad died in 1863, weeks after his last campaign
 to unite Afghanistan, and as a result, threw Afghanistan
back into civil war with his successors. During this
 time, Afghanistan became a buffer state in the Great
 Game between the British Empire (in British-ruled
India) and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire"] Russian Empire. From India, the British
attempted to subjugate Afghanistan but were repelled in
 the First Anglo-Afghan War. However, the Second
Anglo-Afghan War saw a British victory and the
successful establishment of British political influence
 over Afghanistan. Following the Third Anglo-Afghan
War in 1919, Afghanistan became free of foreign
dominance, and eventually emerged as the independent
 Kingdom of Afghanistan in June 1926 under
 Amanullah Khan. This monarchy lasted almost 50
years, until [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Zahir_Shah"] Zahir Shah was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Afghan_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"] overthrown in 1973,
following which the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Afghanistan_(1973%E2%80%931978)"] Republic of Afghanistan was
established. Since the late 1970s, Afghanistan's history
has been dominated by extensive warfare, including
 coups, revolutions, invasions, insurgencies, and civil
wars. Due to the effects of war, the country has dealt
 with high levels of terrorism, poverty, and child
malnutrition. Afghanistan's economy is the world's
96th-largest, with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product"] gross domestic product (GDP) of
$72.9 billion by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity"] purchasing power parity; the country
fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP),
ranking 169th out of 186 countriesas of 2018.
 On 15 August 2021, the country was captured by the
Taliban, which marked the end of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%932021)"] 2001–2021 war,
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_lengths_of_United_States_participation_in_wars"] longest war in US history.[31] This led to the
overthrowing of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic_of_Afghanistan"] Islamic Republic of Afghanistan
under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Afghanistan"] President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani"] Ashraf Ghani and reinstating the
 Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan under the control of the
Taliban. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US%E2%80%93Taliban_deal"] US–Taliban deal, signed on 29 February
2020 in Qatar, was one of the critical events that caused
the collapse of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Security_Forces"] Afghan National Security Forces
(ANSF).[32] Following the deal, the US dramatically
reduced the number of air attacks and deprived the
 ANSF of a critical edge in fighting the Taliban
insurgency, leading to the Taliban takeover of
Kabul.[33] Soon after, former [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_Afghanistan"] first vice president
 Amrullah Saleh declared himself the caretaker president
 of Afghanistan and announced the resistance against the
Taliban.[34][35]
Afghanistan is prominently rich in natural resources.
Those resources include lithium, iron, zinc, and copper,
amongst many others. It is also the largest producer of
opium.[36] The country is a founding member of the
 United Nations, the Organisation of Islamic 
 unrecognized
government[3]

Etymology
Some scholars suggest that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_(linguistics)"] root name "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_(ethnonym)"] Afghān" is derived from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit"] Sanskrit word [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C5%9Bvaka"] Aśvakan or Assakan
which was the name used for ancient inhabitants of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_Kush"] Hindu Kush.[37] Aśvakan literally means
"horsemen", "horse breeders", or "cavalrymen" (from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%C5%9Bva"] aśva or aspa, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit"] Sanskrit and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avestan"] Avestan words for
"horse").[38] However, others such as Ibrahim Khan, have contended that the word Afghan comes from
Bactrian. [39]
Historically, the ethnonym Afghān was used to refer to ethnic Pashtuns.[40] The Arabic and Persian form of
the name, Afġān, was first attested in the 10th-century geography book [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudud_al-%27Alam"] Hudud al-'Alam.[41] The last part of
the name, "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-stan"] -stan" is a Persian suffix for "place of". Therefore, "Afghanistan" translates to "land of the
 Afghans", or "land of the Pashtuns" in a historical sense. According to the third edition of the Encyclopedia
of Islam:[42]
The name Afghanistan (Afghānistān, land of the Afghans/Pashtuns, afāghina, sing. afghān)
can be traced to the early eighth/fourteenth century, when it designated the easternmost part of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kartid"] Kartid realm. This name was later used for certain regions in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_Iran"] Ṣafavid and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire"] Mughal
empires that were inhabited by Afghans. While based on a state-supporting elite of
 Abdālī/Durrānī Afghans, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durrani_Empire"] Sadūzāʾī Durrānī polity that came into being in 1160/1747 was
not called Afghanistan in its own day. The name became a state designation only during the
colonial intervention of the nineteenth century.

 Hotak and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durrani_Empire"] Durrani dynasties, which marked the political origins of
the modern state.[43] Throughout millennia several cities within the
modern day Afghanistan served as capitals of various empires,
namely, Bactra (Balkh), Alexandria on the Oxus ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ai-Khanoum"] Ai-Khanoum),
Kapisi, Sigal, Kabul, Kunduz, Zaranj, Firozkoh, Herat, Ghazna

occupation during the 19th and 20th centuries, Afghanistan has been called the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_of_empires_(Afghanistan)"] graveyard of empires",[45]
though it is unknown who coined the phrase.[46]
Prehistory and antiquity
Excavations of prehistoric sites suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000
years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world. An important site
of early historical activities, many believe that Afghanistan compares to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt"] Egypt in terms of the historical
value of its archaeological sites.[47][48]
Ancient era
 Archaeological exploration done in the 20th century suggests
that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely
connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east,
west, and north. Artifacts typical of the Paleolithic,
Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age"] Iron Ages have been
found in Afghanistan. Urban civilization is believed to have
begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mundigak"] Mundigak
(near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar"] Kandahar in the south of the country) was a center of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmand_culture"] Helmand culture. More recent findings established that
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization"] Indus Valley Civilization stretched up towards modern- The extent of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization"] Indus Valley Civilization
day Afghanistan, making the ancient civilization today part during its mature phase
of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and India. In more detail, it
extended from what today is northwest Pakistan to northwest
India and northeast Afghanistan. An Indus Valley site has been found on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxus_River"] Oxus River at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortugai"] Shortugai in
northern Afghanistan.[49][50] There are several smaller IVC colonies to be found in Afghanistan as well.
An Indus Valley site has been found on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxus_River"] Oxus River at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortugai"] Shortugai in northern Afghanistan, shows
Afghanistan to have been a part of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization"] Indus Valley Civilization.[51]
After 2000 BCE, successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into
Afghanistan; among them were many [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages"] Indo-European-speaking [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Iranians"] Indo-Iranians. These tribes later migrated
further into South Asia, Western Asia, and toward Europe via the area north of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea"] Caspian Sea. The region
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz"]
Page 6
at the time was referred to as Ariana.[47][52]
By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medes"] Medes and incorporated Arachosia, Aria, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactria"] Bactria within its
 eastern boundaries. An inscription on the tombstone of Darius I of
Persia mentions the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabulistan"] Kabul Valley in a list of the 29 countries that he
had conquered.[53] The region of Arachosia, around [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar"] Kandahar in
modern-day southern Afghanistan, used to be primarily Zoroastrian
and played a key role in the transfer of the Avesta to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persis"] Persia and is
thus considered by some to be the "second homeland of
Zoroastrianism".[54][55][56]

occupation, the successor state of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire"] Seleucid Empire controlled
 the region until 305 BCE when they gave much of it to the Maurya
Empire as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans controlled the area south of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_Kush"] Hindu Kush until they
were overthrown in about 185 BCE. Their decline began 60 years after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka"] Ashoka's rule ended, leading to the
 Hellenistic reconquest by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Bactrians"] Greco-Bactrians. Much of it soon broke away from them and became part of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Greek_Kingdom"] Indo-Greek Kingdom. They were defeated and expelled by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Scythians"] Indo-Scythians in the late 2nd century
BCE.[57][58]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road"] Silk Road appeared during the first century BCE, and
Afghanistan flourished with trade, with routes to China, India,
Persia and north to the cities of Bukhara, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samarkand"] Samarkand and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khiva"] Khiva in
present-day Uzbekistan.[59] Goods and ideas were exchanged at
this center point, such as Chinese silk, Persian silver and Roman
gold, while the region of present Afghanistan was mining and
trading [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_lazuli"] lapis lazuli stones[60] mainly from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badakhshan"] Badakhshan region.
During the first century BCE, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire"] Parthian Empire subjugated the
region but lost it to their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Parthian"] Indo-Parthian vassals. In the mid-to-late
first century CE the vast [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kushan_Empire"] Kushan Empire, centered in Afghanistan,
became great patrons of Buddhist culture, making [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism"] Buddhism
flourish throughout the region. The Kushans were overthrown by
 the Sassanids in the 3rd century CE, though the Indo-
Sassanids continued to rule at least parts of the region.
They were followed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidarite"] Kidarites who, in turn, was
replaced by the Hephthalites. They were replaced by
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turk_Shahi"] Turk Shahi in the 7th century. The Buddhist Turk

extended their Islamic influence south of the Hindu Kush. It is reported that Muslims and non-Muslims still
lived side by side in Kabul before the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghaznavids"] Ghaznavids rose to power in the 10th century.[73][74][75]
By the 11th century, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_of_Ghazni"] Mahmud of Ghazni defeated the remaining Hindu rulers and effectively [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamized"] Islamized the

 The Ghurids controlled Afghanistan for less than a century before being conquered by the Khwarazmian
dynasty in 1215.[79]
Mongols and Babur with the Lodi Dynasty
 In 1219 CE, Genghis Khan and his Mongol army overran
the region. His troops are said to have annihilated the
Khwarazmian cities of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herat"] Herat and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkh"] Balkh as well as
Bamyan.[80] The destruction caused by the Mongols forced
many locals to return to an agrarian rural society.[81] Mongol
rule continued with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilkhanate"] Ilkhanate in the northwest while the
 Khalji dynasty administered the Afghan tribal areas south of
the Hindu Kush until the invasion of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur"] Timur (aka Tamerlane),
who established the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timurid_Empire"] Timurid Empire in 1370. Under the rule

Kabulistan, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_of_Afghanistan"] Afghanistan formed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frontier"] frontier between Khorasan and Hindustan. However, up to the
 19th century the term Khorasan was commonly used among natives to describe their country; Sir George
Elphinstone wrote with amazement that the country known to outsiders as "Afghanistan" was referred to
by its own inhabitants as "Khorasan" and that the first Afghan official whom he met at the border
welcomed him to Khorasan.[87][88][89][90]

Mirwais died of natural causes in 1715 and was
succeeded by his brother [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Aziz_Hotak"] Abdul Aziz, who was soon
killed by Mirwais' son [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Hotak"] Mahmud for possibly planning
to concede territories back to the Safavids. Mahmud

Fall of the Hotak Dynasty
In 1738, Nader Shah and his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afsharid_dynasty"] forces captured
Kandahar in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Kandahar"] Siege of Kandahar, the last Hotak
stronghold, from Shah [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussain_Hotak"] Hussain Hotak. Soon after, the
Persian and Afghan forces [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nader_Shah%27s_invasion_of_India"] invaded India, Nader Shah
had plundered Delhi, alongside his 16 year old
commander, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Shah_Durrani"] Ahmad Shah Durrani who had assisted
him on these campaigns. Nader Shah was assassinated
in 1747.[92][93]
Rise of the Durrani Empire
 After the death of Nader Shah in 1747, Ahmad Shah Map of the Hotak Empire at its height in 1728.
Durrani had returned to Kandahar with a contingent of  Disputed between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussain_Hotak"] Hussain Hotak (Centered in

accepted" Ahmad Shah as their new leader. With his
acension in 1747, Ahmad Shah had led multiple
campaigns against the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire"] Mughal Empire, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratha_Empire"] Maratha Empire, and then receding, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afsharid_Empire"] Afsharid Empire. Ahmad Shah
had captured [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul"] Kabul and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshawar"] Peshawar from the Mughal appointed governor, Nasir Khan. Ahmad Shah had
then conquered [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herat"] Herat in 1750, and had also captured [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir"] Kashmir in 1752.[94] Ahmad Shah had launched two
campaigns into Khorasan, (1750–1751) and (1754–1755).[95] His first campaign had seen the siege of
Mashhad, however he was forced to retreat after 4 months. In November 1750, he moved to siege
Nishapur, however he was unable to capture the city and was forced to retreat in early 1751. Ahmad Shah
returned in 1754, he captured Tun, and on 23 July, he sieged [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashhad"] Mashhad once again. Mashhad had fallen on
2 December, however Shah rokh was reappointed in 1755. He was forced to give up Torshiz, Bakharz,
Jam, Khaf, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torbat-e_Heydarieh"] Turbat-e Haidari to the Afghans. Following this, Ahmad Shah had sieged [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanate_of_Nishapur"] Nishapur once
again, and captured it.
Objectives and Invasions of India
Page 9
Ahmad Shah invaded India 8 times during his reign. With the
capture of Peshawar, Ahmad Shah had used this as a convenient
striking point to lead his military campaigns into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab"] Punjab and India.
Ahmad Shah had sought out multiple reasons for his invasions,
Ahmad Shah saw Afghanistan in a dire state, and one that needed
to expand and exploit a weak but rich neighboring country, which
Ahmad Shah had capitalized on in multiple opportunities during his
Invasions of India, he sought the reasons needed to fill his treasury
in a war-plunder conquest based economy.[96] Ahmad Shah had
launched his first invasion in 1748, crossing the indus river, his
armies sacked and absorbed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore"] Lahore into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durrani_Empire"] Durrani Realm.
 Ahmad Shah had met Mughal armies at the Battle of Manupur
(1748), where he was defeated and forced to retreat to back to
Afghanistan.[97] Ahmad Shah had returned the next year in 1749,
where he had captured the area around [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahore"] Lahore and Punjab,
presenting it as an Afghan victory for this campaign. From 1749 to
1767, Ahmad Shah would lead 6 more invasions, the most
important being his sixth invasion, with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Battle_of_Panipat"] Third Battle of Panipat,
which created a power vacumn in northern India, halting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratha_Empire"] Maratha
expansion.

Death of Ahmad Shah and his Successors
Ahmad Shah Durrani had died in October 1772, what followed would be a civil war in succession, with
his named successor, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timur_Shah_Durrani"] Timur Shah Durrani succeeding him after the defeat of his brother, Suleiman
Mirza.[98]
 Timur Shah Durrani ascended to the throne in November 1772, having defeated a coalition under Shah
Wali Khan, the influential prime minister of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durrani_Empire"] Durrani Empire, and Humayun Mirza. Timur Shah began
his reign by consolidating power toward himself and people loyal to him, purging Durrani Sardars and
influential tribal leaders in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul"] Kabul and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar"] Kandahar to bring support toward himself. Timur Shah's reforms also
saw the capital of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durrani_Empire"] Durrani Empire being shifted from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar"] Kandahar to Kabul, being able to cover the
empire better as a base of ordination since it was essentially the heartland of the empire. This reform saw
 Kabul as the modern capital of Afghanistan today. Having consolidated power to himself, Timur Shah
would fight multiple series of rebellions to consolidate and hold the empire apart, Timur Shah would also
lead campaigns into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab"] Punjab against the Sikhs like his father did, however being more successful. Most
prominent example of his battles during this campaign would be where Timur Shah led his forces under
Zangi Khan Durrani, with over 18,000 men total of Afghan, Qizilbash, and Mongol cavalrymen. Against
over 60,000 Sikh men. The Sikhs would lose over 30,000 in this battle and would stage a Durrani
resurgence in Punjab.[99] The Durranis lost [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multan"] Multan in 1772 after Ahmad Shah's death, following this
victory by Timur Shah, Timur Shah was able to lay siege to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multan"] Multan and recapture it,[100] incorporating it
into the Durrani empire once again, reintegrating it as a province until the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Multan_(1818)"] Siege of Multan (1818). Timur
Shah would be succeeded by his son, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaman_Shah_Durrani"] Zaman Shah Durrani after his death on 18 or 20 May 1793. Timur
Shah's reign oversaw the attempted stabilization and consolidation of the empire. However, Timur Shah
had over 24 sons, a mistake that would plunge the empire in civil war over succession crises.[101]
 Zaman Shah Durrani would succeed to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durrani_Empire"] Durrani Throne following the death of his father, Timur Shah
Durrani. This instigated civil war with his brothers, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Shah_Durrani"] Mahmud Shah Durrani, and Humayun Mirza revolting
against him. With Humayun centered in Kandahar, and Mahmud Shah centered in Herat.[102] Zaman Shah
would defeat Humayun and also force the loyalty of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Shah_Durrani"] Mahmud Shah Durrani.[102] Securing his position on
Page 10
the throne, Zaman Shah had led 3 campaigns into Punjab, with the first two campaigns capturing Lahore,
but being forced to retreat due to issues from a possible [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qajar_Iran"] Qajar invasion, or his brother, Mahmud Shah
Durrani revolting. Zaman Shah embarked on his third campaign for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab"] Punjab in 1800 to deal with a
rebellious Ranjit Singh.[103] However, he was forced to withdraw, with his brother, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Shah_Durrani"] Mahmud Shah Durrani
 revolting, Zaman Shah would be toppled from his reign, replaced by his brother, Mahmud Shah
Durrani.[103] However, just under 2 years in his reign, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Shah_Durrani"] Mahmud Shah Durrani would be deposed by his
 brother, Shah Shuja Durrani, on 13 July 1803.[104] Shah Shuja would attempt to consolidate the Durrani
Realm, which had been long striven by civil war. Shah Shuja would later be deposed by his brother at the
 Battle of Nimla (1809),[105] where [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Shah_Durrani"] Mahmud Shah Durrani would defeat and force Shah Shuja to flee, with
Shah Mahmud usurping the throne again for his second reign beginning on 3 May 1809.[106]

from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qajar_dynasty"] Persians in the west and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikh_Empire"] Sikh Empire in the east.
Afghanistan was divided, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herat_(1793-1863)"] Emirate of Herat centered
in the east. Fateh Khan, leader of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barakzai_dynasty"] Barakzai tribe, installed many
of his brothers in positions of power throughout the empire, mostly
ruling as governors of major cities and provinces. After his murder
for apparent treason against the Durrani king. Fateh Khan would be
sentenced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Shah_Durrani"] Mahmud Shah Durrani, having him executed. His
brothers rebelled and divided up the provinces of the empire
between themselves. During this turbulent period, Afghanistan had
many temporary rulers until [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dost_Mohammad_Khan"] Dost Mohammad Khan declared
himself emir in 1826.[107] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab"] Punjab and
 Kashmir were lost to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranjit_Singh"] Ranjit Singh,
who invaded [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa"] Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in
March 1823 and captured the city of
 Peshawar at  the Battle of
Nowshera.[108] In 1837, during the
 Battle of Jamrud near the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pass"] Khyber Pass,
 Akbar Khan and the Afghan army
failed to capture the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamrud_Fort"] Jamrud Fort from
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikh_Khalsa_Army"] Sikh Khalsa Army, but killed Sikh
Commander [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Singh_Nalwa"] Hari Singh Nalwa, thus
ending the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan-Sikh_Wars"] Afghan-Sikh Wars. By this
time the British were advancing from
the east and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Anglo-Afghan_War"] first major conflict
during "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game"] the Great Game" was
initiated.[109]
In 1838, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army"] British expeditionary force
marched into Afghanistan and arrested
 Dost Mohammad, sent him into exile
 in India and replaced him with Shah
Shuja, the former [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_heads_of_state_of_Afghanistan"] Durrani king as a
puppet on the throne.[110][111]

British gave up on their attempts to try and subjugate Afghanistan, and allowed Dost Mohammad Khan as
ruler and withdrew their military forces from Afghanistan. Dost Mohammad Khan would spend most of his
reign consolidating the parts of Afghanistan that were lost in the Durrani civil wars. Dost Mohammad Khan
would launch numerous campaigns, and also be able to reunite the Afghan realm in his reign, securing
 Herat in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herat_Campaign_of_1862%E2%80%9363"] Herat Campaign of 1862–63. Dost Mohammad died on 9 June 1863, a few months after his
 campaign to capture Herat. Dost Mohammad's successors would fight for the throne of Afghanistan,
 between Sher Ali Khan, Mohammad Afzal Khan, and Mohammad Azam Khan in the Afghan Civil War
(1863–1869). Sher Ali would win this civil war and would go on to rule the realm until In 1878, the British
had returned in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Anglo-Afghan_War"] Second Anglo-Afghan War which was fought over perceived Russian influence in the
region, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdur_Rahman_Khan"] Abdur Rahman Khan replaced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Ayub_Khan_(Emir_of_Afghanistan)"] Ayub Khan who had succeeded [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sher_Ali_Khan"] Sher Ali Khan after his death in

1879, making it an official [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Protectorate"] British Protected State.[112] In 1893, Amir Abdur Rahman signed an agreement

remained politically independent until being [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquests_of_Afghanistan"] conquered by Abdur Rahman Khan in 1891–1896. He was
known as the "Iron Amir" for his features and his ruthless methods against tribes.[113] The Iron Amir
viewed railway and telegraph lines coming from the Russian and British as "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse"] trojan horses" and therefore
 prevented railway development in Afghanistan.[114] He died in 1901, succeeded by his son, Habibullah
Khan.
How can a small power like Afghanistan, which is like a goat between these lions [Britain and
Russia] or a grain of wheat between two strong millstones of the grinding mill, [could] stand in
the midway of the stones without being ground to dust?
— Abdur [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdur_Rahman_Khan"] Rahman Khan, the "Iron Amir", in 1900[115][116]
During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War"] First World War, when Afghanistan was neutral, Habibullah Khan was met by officials of the
Central Powers in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niedermayer%E2%80%93Hentig_Expedition"] Niedermayer–Hentig Expedition, to declare full independence from the United
Kingdom, join them and attack British India, as part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu%E2%80%93German_Conspiracy"] Hindu–German Conspiracy. Their efforts to
bring Afghanistan into the Central Powers failed, but it caused discontent among the population for keeping
neutrality against the British. Habibullah was assassinated during a hunting trip in February 1919, and
 Amanullah Khan eventually assumed power. A staunch supporter of the 1915–1916 expeditions,
Amanullah Khan provoked the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Anglo-Afghan_War"] Third Anglo-Afghan War, entering British India via the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pass"] Khyber Pass.[117]
After the end of the Third Anglo-Afghan War and the signing of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Afghan_Treaty_of_1919"] Treaty of Rawalpindi on 19 August
1919, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emir_of_Afghanistan"] Emir Amanullah Khan declared the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Afghanistan"] Emirate of Afghanistan a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state"] sovereign and fully [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_state"] independent state.
He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the
international community, particularly with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"] Soviet Union and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic"] Weimar Republic of
Germany.[118][119] He proclaimed himself [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Afghanistan"] King of Afghanistan on 9 June 1926, when the Emirate of
Afghanistan became the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Afghanistan"] Kingdom of Afghanistan. Following a 1927–28 tour of Europe and Turkey, he
introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was
 Mahmud Tarzi, an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's
1923 constitution, which made elementary education compulsory. The institution of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery"] slavery was abolished
in the Emirate of Afghanistan in 1923.[120] King Amanullah's wife, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soraya_Tarzi"] Queen Soraya, was an important figure
during this period in the fight for woman's education and against their oppression.[121]
Some of the reforms that were put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa"] burqa for women and the
opening of several co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders, and this led
to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Civil_War_(1928%E2%80%931929)"] Afghan Civil War (1928–1929). Faced with the overwhelming armed opposition, King Amanullah

 Prince [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Nadir_Shah"] Mohammed Nadir Shah, Amanullah's cousin, in turn defeated and
killed Kalakani in October 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah.[123]
He abandoned the reforms of King Amanullah in favor of a more gradual
approach to modernization, but was assassinated in 1933 by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Khaliq_Hazara_(assassin)"] Abdul Khaliq,

 Mohammed Zahir Shah, Nadir Shah's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the
 throne and reigned as King from 1933 to 1973. The tribal revolts of 1944–
1947 saw King Zahir's reign challenged by Zadran, Safi, Mangal, and
 Wazir tribesmen led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazrak_Zadran"] Mazrak Zadran, Salemai, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faqir_Ipi"] Mirzali Khan, among

Contemporary history
Until 1946, King Zahir ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the
post of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Afghanistan"] Prime Minister and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another
of Zahir Shah's uncles, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Mahmud_Khan"] Shah Mahmud Khan, became Prime Minister in
1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but
reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. He was replaced
in 1953 by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Daoud_Khan"] Mohammed Daoud Khan, the king's cousin and brother-in-law,
and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtun"] Pashtun nationalist who sought the creation of a Pashtunistan, leading
to highly tense relations with Pakistan.[127] During his ten years at the post
until 1963, Daoud Khan pressed for social modernization reforms and
 sought a closer relationship with the Soviet Union. Afterward, the 1964
constitution was formed, and the first non-royal Prime Minister was sworn
in.[125]
King Zahir Shah, like his father Nadir Shah, had a policy of maintaining
national independence while pursuing gradual modernization, creating
nationalist feeling, and improving relations with the United Kingdom.

monarch of Afghanistan,

 World War II nor aligned with either power bloc in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War"] Cold War thereafter.
However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union
and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports, and other vital
 infrastructure in the post-war period. On a per capita basis, Afghanistan received more Soviet development
aid than any other country. Afghanistan had, therefore, good relations with both Cold War enemies. In
 1973, while the King was in Italy, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first President
of Afghanistan, abolishing the monarchy.
Democratic Republic and Soviet war
Page 13
 In April 1978, the communist People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA)
seized power in a bloody coup d'état against
then-President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Daoud_Khan"] Mohammed Daoud Khan, in
what is called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saur_Revolution"] Saur Revolution. The
PDPA declared the establishment of the
 Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, with its
 first leader named as People's Democratic
 Party general secretary Nur Muhammad Soviet troops in Gardez,
Taraki.[128] This would trigger a series of
events that would dramatically turn
Afghanistan from a poor and secluded (albeit
peaceful) country to a hotbed of international
terrorism.[129] The PDPA initiated various

social, symbolic and land distribution reforms
that provoked strong opposition, while also
brutally oppressing political dissidents. This
caused unrest and quickly expanded into a
state of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(1978%E2%80%93present)"] civil war by 1979, waged by guerrilla
 mujahideen (and smaller [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoist"] Maoist guerrillas)
against regime forces countrywide. It quickly
turned into a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_war"] proxy war as the Pakistani
government provided these rebels with covert
training centers, the United States [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cyclone"] supported them through Pakistan's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence"] Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI),[130]
and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"] Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA regime.[131] Meanwhile,
there was increasingly hostile friction between the competing factions of the PDPA – the dominant [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalq"] Khalq
and the more moderate Parcham.[132]
In September 1979, PDPA General Secretary Taraki was assassinated in an internal coup orchestrated by
fellow Khalq member, then-prime minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hafizullah_Amin"] Hafizullah Amin, who assumed the new general secretary of the
 People's Democratic Party. The situation in the country deteriorated under Amin and thousands of people
went missing.[133] Displeased with Amin's government, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Army"] Soviet Army invaded the country in December
1979, heading for Kabul and killing Amin just three days later.[134] A Soviet-organized regime, led by
Parcham's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babrak_Karmal"] Babrak Karmal but inclusive of both factions (Parcham and Khalq), filled the vacuum. Soviet
troops in more substantial numbers were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal, marking the
beginning of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War"] Soviet–Afghan War.[135] The United States and Pakistan,[130] along with smaller actors
like Saudi Arabia and China, continued supporting the rebels, delivering billions of dollars in cash and
weapons including two thousand [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIM-92_Stinger"] FIM-92 Stinger [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missiles"] surface-to-air missiles.[136][137] Lasting nine years, the
war caused the deaths of between 562,000[138] and 2 million Afghans,[139][140][141][142][143][144][145] and
displaced about 6 million people who subsequently fled Afghanistan, mainly to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghans_in_Pakistan"] Pakistan and Iran.[146]
Heavy air bombardment destroyed many countryside villages, millions of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landmine"] landmines were planted,[147] and
 some cities such as Herat and Kandahar were also damaged from bombardment. Pakistan's North-West
Frontier Province functioned as an organizational and networking base for the anti-Soviet Afghan
resistance, with the province's influential [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deobandi"] Deobandi ulama playing a major supporting role in promoting the
'jihad'.[148] After the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_withdrawal_from_Afghanistan"] Soviet withdrawal, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Civil_War_(1989-92)"] civil war ensued until the communist regime under People's
Democratic Party leader [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Najibullah"] Mohammad Najibullah collapsed in 1992.[149][150][151]
The Soviet-Afghan War had drastic social effects on Afghanistan. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarization"] militarization of society led to
heavily armed police, private bodyguards, openly armed civil defense groups and other such things
becoming the norm in Afghanistan for decades thereafter.[152] The traditional power structure had shifted
from clergy, community elders, intelligentsia and military in favor of powerful warlords.[153]
Page 14
Post–Cold War conflict
Another civil war broke out after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peshawar_Accords"] creation of a
dysfunctional coalition [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Afghanistan"] government between
leaders of various mujahideen factions. Amid a
state of  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy"] anarchy and factional
infighting,[154][155][156] various mujahideen
factions committed widespread rape, murder and
extortion,[155][157][158] while Kabul was heavily
bombarded and partially destroyed by the
fighting.[158] Several failed reconciliations and
alliances occurred between different leaders.[159]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban"] Taliban emerged in September 1994 as a
movement and militia of students (talib) from
Islamic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrassas_in_Pakistan"] madrassas (schools) in Pakistan,[158][160]
who soon had military support from Pakistan.[161]

they conquered more territories until finally
driving out the government of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burhanuddin_Rabbani"] Rabbani from Kabul in 1996,[162][163] where they established an
 emirate[164] that gained international recognition from 3 countries: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United
Arab Emirates.[165] The Taliban were condemned internationally for the harsh enforcement of their
interpretation of Islamic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia"] sharia law, which resulted in the brutal treatment of many Afghans, especially
women.[166][167] During their rule, the Taliban and their allies committed massacres against Afghan
civilians, denied UN food supplies to starving civilians and conducted a policy of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_earth"] scorched earth, burning
vast areas of fertile land and destroying tens of thousands of homes.[168][169][170][171][172][173]
 After the fall of Kabul to the Taliban, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Shah_Massoud"] Ahmad Shah Massoud and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Rashid_Dostum"] Abdul Rashid Dostum formed the
 Northern Alliance, later joined by others, to resist the Taliban. Dostum's forces were defeated by the
 Taliban during the Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif in 1997 and 1998; Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff, Pervez
Musharraf, began sending thousands of Pakistanis to help the Taliban defeat the Northern
Alliance.[174][161][175][176][177] By 2000 the Northern Alliance only controlled 10% of territory, cornered
in the north-east. On 9 September 2001, Massoud was assassinated by two Arab [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack"] suicide attackers in
 Panjshir Valley. Around 400,000 Afghans died in internal conflicts between 1990 and 2001.[178]
21st century
In October 2001, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_invasion_of_Afghanistan"] United States invaded Afghanistan to remove the Taliban from power after they
refused to hand over [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_Bin_Laden"] Osama Bin Laden, the prime suspect of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks"] September 11 attacks, who was a "guest"
of the Taliban and was operating his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda"] al-Qaeda network in Afghanistan.[179][180][181] The majority of
Afghans supported the American invasion of their country.[182][183] During the initial invasion, US and
UK forces bombed al-Qaeda training camps, and later working with the Northern Alliance, the Taliban
regime came to an end.[184]
In December 2001, after the Taliban government was overthrown, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Interim_Administration"] Afghan Interim Administration
under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Karzai"] Hamid Karzai was formed. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security_Assistance_Force"] International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) was established by
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council"] UN Security Council to help assist the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karzai_administration"] Karzai administration and provide basic security.[185][186] By
this time, after two decades of war as well as an acute [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine"] famine at the time, Afghanistan had one of the
highest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality"] infant and child mortality rates in the world, the lowest life expectancy, much of the population
were hungry,[187][188][189] and infrastructure was in ruins.[190] Many foreign donors started providing aid
and assistance to rebuild the war-torn country.[191][192]
Page 15
Taliban forces meanwhile began regrouping inside Pakistan, while
 more coalition troops entered Afghanistan to help the rebuilding
process.[193][194] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban_insurgency"] Taliban began an insurgency to regain
 control of Afghanistan. Over the next decade, ISAF and Afghan
troops led many offensives against the Taliban, but failed to fully
defeat them. Afghanistan remained one of the poorest countries in
 the world because of a lack of foreign investment, government
corruption, and the Taliban insurgency.[195][196] Meanwhile,
Karzai attempted to unite the peoples of the country,[197] and the
 Afghan government was able to build some democratic structures,
 adopting a constitution in 2004 with the name Islamic Republic of 
U.S. troops and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook"] Chinooks in
Afghanistan, 2008
Afghanistan. Attempts were made, often with the support of
foreign donor countries, to improve the country's economy, healthcare, education, transport, and
agriculture. ISAF forces also began to train the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Security_Forces"] Afghan National Security Forces. Following 2002, nearly
five million [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_diaspora"] Afghans were repatriated.[198] The number of NATO troops present in Afghanistan peaked at
140,000 in 2011,[199] dropping to about 16,000 in 2018.[200]
In September 2014 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani"] Ashraf Ghani became president after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_presidential_election,_2014"] 2014 presidential election where for the first
time in Afghanistan's history power was democratically transferred.[201][202][203][204][205] On 28
December 2014, NATO formally ended ISAF combat operations in Afghanistan and transferred full
security responsibility to the Afghan government. The NATO-led [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Resolute_Support"] Operation Resolute Support was formed
the same day as a successor to ISAF.[206][207] Thousands of NATO troops remained in the country to train
and advise Afghan government forces[208] and continue their fight against the Taliban.[209] It was
estimated in 2015 that "about 147,000 people have been killed in the Afghanistan war since 2001. More
than 38,000 of those killed have been civilians".[210] A report titled Body Count concluded that 106,000–
170,000 civilians had been killed as a result of the fighting in Afghanistan at the hands of all parties to the
conflict.[211] 
On 14 April 2021, NATO Secretary General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg"] Jens Stoltenberg said
 the alliance had agreed to start withdrawing its troops from
Afghanistan by 1 May.[212] Soon after the withdrawal of NATO
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive"] troops started, the Taliban launched an offensive against the
Afghan government, quickly advancing in front of collapsing
Afghan government forces.[213][214] On 15 August 2021, as the
Taliban once again controlled a vast majority of Afghan territory,
they [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Kabul_(2021)"] re-captured the capital city of Kabul, and many civilians,
government officials and foreign diplomats were evacuated.[215]

2021, an unofficial Coordination Council led by senior statesmen
was in the process of coordinating the transfer of the state
institutions of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to the
 Taliban.[217] On 17 August, the First Vice President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Amrullah
 Saleh, proclaimed himself the caretaker President of Afghanistan and announced the formation of an anti-
 Taliban front with a reported 6,000+ troops[218][219] in the Panjshir Valley, along with Ahmad
Massoud.[220][221] However, on 6 September, the Taliban took control of most of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panjshir_province"] Panjshir province,
with resistance fighters retreating to the mountains to continue fighting within the province.[222] Fights in
the valley ceased mid-September,[223] while resistances leaders [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amrullah_Saleh"] Amrullah Saleh and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Massoud"] Ahmad Massoud fled
to neighboring Tajikistan.[224][225][222]

The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was swiftly restored as its
opponents were defeated or left the country. It is apparently led by
 supreme leader [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibatullah_Akhundzada"] Hibatullah Akhundzada[226] and acting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Afghanistan"] Prime Minister
 Hasan Akhund, who took office on 7 September 2021.[227][228]
Akhund is one of the four founders of the Taliban[229] and was a
deputy Prime Minister in their previous Emirate; his appointment was
 seen as a compromise between moderates and hardliners.[230] A new,
all-male cabinet was formed including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Hakim_Ishaqzai"] Abdul Hakim Ishaqzai as
 Minister of Justice.[231][232] On 20 September 2021, United Nations
Secretary-General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres"] António Guterres received a letter from acting
 minister of Foreign Affairs [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amir_Khan_Muttaqi"] Amir Khan Muttaqi to formally claim

1996 to 2001, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"] United Nations never recognized their representatives and chose to work with the then-
government in exile instead.[233]
Western nations have suspended most humanitarian aid to Afghanistan following the Taliban's takeover of
the country in August 2021 and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank"] World Bank and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund"] International Monetary Fund also halted
 payments.[234][235] In October 2021, more than half of Afghanistan's 39 million people faced an acute food
shortage.[236] On 11 November 2021, the Human Rights Watch reported that Afghanistan was facing
widespread [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine"] famine due to an economic and banking crisis.[237]
Geography
Afghanistan is located in Southern-Central Asia.[238][239][240][241][242] The region centered at Afghanistan
is considered the "crossroads of Asia",[243] and the country has had the nickname Heart of Asia.[244] The
renowned [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu"] Urdu poet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allama_Iqbal"] Allama Iqbal once wrote about the country:
Asia is a body of water and earth, of which the Afghan nation is the heart. From its discord,
the discord of Asia; and from its accord, the accord of Asia.
At over 652,864 km2 (252,072 sq mi),[245] Afghanistan is the world's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area"] 41st largest country,[246] slightly
bigger than France and smaller than Myanmar, and about the size of Texas in the United States. There is no
coastline, as Afghanistan is landlocked. Afghanistan shares its longest land border (the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durand_Line"] Durand Line) with
Pakistan to the east and south, followed by borders with Tajikistan to the north-east, Iran to the west,
Turkmenistan to the north-west, Uzbekistan to the north and China to the north-east; India recognizes a
border with Afghanistan through Pakistani-administered Kashmir.[247] Clockwise from south-west,
Afghanistan shares borders with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistan_and_Baluchestan_Province"] Sistan and Baluchestan Province, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Khorasan_Province"] South Khorasan Province and

 Tajikistan; Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China; and the Gilgit-Baltistan territory, Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa province and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan,_Pakistan"] Balochistan province of Pakistan.[248]
The geography in Afghanistan is varied, but is mostly mountainous and rugged, with some unusual
mountain ridges accompanied by plateaus and river basins.[249] It is dominated by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_Kush"] Hindu Kush range,
the western extension of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas"] Himalayas that stretches to eastern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet"] Tibet via the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamir_Mountains"] Pamir Mountains and
 Karakoram Mountains in Afghanistan's far north-east. Most of the highest points are in the east consisting
of fertile mountain valleys, often considered part of the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roof_of_the_World"] Roof of the World". The Hindu Kush ends at the
west-central highlands, creating plains in the north and southwest, namely the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkestan"] Turkestan Plains and the
Page 17
 Sistan Basin; these two regions consist of rolling grasslands and semi-deserts, and hot windy deserts,
 respectively.[250] Forests exist in the corridor between Nuristan and Paktika provinces (see East Afghan
montane conifer forests),[251] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra"] tundra in the north-east. The country's highest point is Noshaq, at
7,492 m (24,580 ft) above sea level.[10] The lowest point lies in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jowzjan_Province"] Jowzjan Province along the Amu River
bank, at 258 m (846 ft) above sea level. 
Despite having numerous rivers and reservoirs,
large parts of the country are dry. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorheic"] endorheic
Sistan Basin is one of the driest regions in the
world.[252] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amu_Darya"] Amu Darya rises at the north of
the Hindu Kush, while the nearby [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Rud"] Hari Rud flows
west towards Herat, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arghandab_River"] Arghandab River
from the central region southwards. To the south
and west of the Hindu Kush flow a number of
streams that are tributaries of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_River"] Indus River,[249]
such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmand_River"] Helmand River. One exception is the
 Kabul River which flows in an easternly direction
to the Indus ending at the Indian Ocean.[253]
Afghanistan receives heavy snow during the

and the melting snow in the spring season enters
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rivers_of_Afghanistan"] rivers, lakes, and streams.[254][255] However,
two-thirds of the country's water flows into the
neighboring countries of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan. As reported in 2010, the state needs more than
US$2 billion to rehabilitate its irrigation systems so that the water is properly managed.[256]
The northeastern Hindu Kush [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_range"] mountain range, in and around the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badakhshan_Province"] Badakhshan Province of Afghanistan, is
in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment#Geological_activity"] geologically active area where earthquakes may occur almost every year.[257] They can be deadly and
destructive, causing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide"] landslides in some parts or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Afghan_avalanches"] avalanches during the winter.[258] The last strong
earthquakes were in 1998, which killed about 6,000 people in Badakhshan near Tajikistan.[259] This was
followed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Hindu_Kush_earthquakes"] 2002 Hindu Kush earthquakes in which over 150 people were killed and over 1,000
injured. A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Afghanistan_earthquake"] 2010 earthquake left 11 Afghans dead, over 70 injured, and more than 2,000 houses destroyed.
Climate
Afghanistan has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_climate"] continental climate with harsh winters
in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazarajat"] central highlands, the glaciated northeast (around
Nuristan), and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakhan_Corridor"] Wakhan Corridor, where the average
temperature in January is below −15 °C (5 °F) and can
reach −26 °C (−15 °F),[249] and hot summers in the
low-lying areas of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistan_Basin"] Sistan Basin of the southwest, the
 Jalalabad basin in the east, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Turkestan"] Turkestan plains
along the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amu_River"] Amu River in the north, where temperatures
average over 35 °C (95 °F) in July[10][261] and can go
over 43 °C (109 °F).[249] The country is generally [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arid"] arid 
 Köppen climate map of Afghanistan[260]
in the summers, with most rainfall falling between December and April. The lower areas of northern and
western Afghanistan are the driest, with precipitation more common in the east. Although proximate to
India, Afghanistan is mostly outside the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon"] monsoon zone,[249] except the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuristan_Province"] Nuristan Province which
occasionally receives summer monsoon rain.[262]

variety of birds despite its relatively arid climate – an estimated 460 species of which 235 breed within.[265]
The forest region of Afghanistan has vegetation such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_tree"] pine trees, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce_tree"] spruce trees, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fir_tree"] fir trees and larches,
whereas the steppe grassland regions consist of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadleaf_tree"] broadleaf trees, short grass, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_plant"] perennial plants and shrublands.
The colder high elevation regions are composed of hardy grasses and small flowering plants.[263] Several
regions are designated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_protected_areas_of_Afghanistan"] protected areas; there are three [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_parks"] national parks: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band-e_Amir"] Band-e Amir, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakhan_National_Park"] Wakhan and Nuristan.
Afghanistan had a 2018 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Landscape_Integrity_Index"] Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 8.85/10, ranking it 15th globally
out of 172 countries.[266]
Demographics
The population of Afghanistan was estimated at
32.9 million as of 2019 by the Afghanistan Statistics and
Information Authority,[268] whereas the UN estimates
over 38.0 million.[269] In 1979 the total population was
reported to be about 15.5 million.[270] About 23.9% of
them are urbanite, 71.4% live in rural areas, and the
remaining 4.7% are nomadic.[271] An additional
3 million or so Afghans are temporarily housed in
neighboring [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghans_in_Pakistan"] Pakistan and Iran, most of whom were born
and raised in those two countries. As of 2013,
Afghanistan was the largest refugee-producing country
in the world, a title held for 32 years. 
A 2005 CIA map showing traditional Afghan tribal
territories. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtun_tribes"] Pashtun tribes form the world's largest
tribal society.[267]
The current population growth rate is 2.37%,[10] one of
the highest in the world outside of Africa. This population is expected to reach 82 million by 2050 if
current population trends continue.[272] The population of Afghanistan increased steadily until the 1980s,
when civil war caused millions to flee to other countries such as Pakistan.[273] Millions have since returned
and the war conditions contribute to the country having the highest fertility rate outside Africa.[274]
Afghanistan's healthcare has recovered since the turn of the century, causing falls in infant mortality and
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuristan_National_Park"]
Page 19
increases in life expectancy, although it has the lowest life expectance of any country outside Africa. This
(along with other factors such as returning refugees) caused rapid population growth in the 2000s that has
only recently started to slow down. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient"] Gini coefficient in 2008 was 27.8.[275]
Ethnicity and languages
 Afghans are divided into several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnolinguistic"] ethnolinguistic groups.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtuns"] Pashtuns are the largest ethnic group, comprising
 39% (2019 sociological research data by The Asia
Foundation),  followed by Tajiks (or Farsiwans),
comprising 37%.[276] of the country's  population.
Generally the other three major ethnic groups are the
Tajiks, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazaras"] Hazaras and Uzbeks. A further 10 other ethnic
groups are recognized and each are represented in the
 Afghan National Anthem.[277]
 Dari and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashto"] Pashto are the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_language"] official languages of
Afghanistan; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilingualism"] bilingualism is very common.[278] Dari,
which is a variety of and mutually intelligible with
 Persian (and very often called 'Farsi' by some Afghans
like in Iran) functions as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingua_franca"] lingua franca in Kabul as  Ethnolinguistic map of Afghanistan (2001)
well as in much of the northern and northwestern parts
of the country.[279] Native speakers of Dari, of any
ethnicity, are sometimes called Farsiwans.[280] Pashto is the native tongue of the Pashtuns, although many
of them are also fluent in Dari while some non-Pashtuns are fluent in Pashto. Despite the Pashtuns having
been dominant in Afghan politics for centuries, Dari remained the preferred language for government and
bureaucracy.[281] According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Factbook"] CIA World Factbook, Dari Persian is spoken by 78% ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_language"] L1 + L2) and
functions as the lingua franca, while Pashto is spoken by 50%, Uzbek 10%, English 5%, Turkmen 2%,
Urdu 2%, Pashayi 1%, Nuristani 1%, Arabic 1%, and Balochi 1% (2021 est). Data represent the most
widely spoken languages; shares sum to more than 100% because there is much bilingualism in the country
and because respondents were allowed to select more than one language.There are a number of smaller
regional languages, including Uzbek, Turkmen, Balochi, Pashayi, and Nuristani.[282]
When it comes to foreign languages among the populace, many are able to speak or understand [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_language"] Hindustani
(Urdu-Hindi), partly due to returning Afghan refugees from Pakistan and the popularity of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollywood"] Bollywood films
respectively.[283] English is also understood by some of the population,[284] and has been gaining
popularity as of the 2000s.[285] Some Afghans retain some ability in Russian, which was taught in public
schools during the 1980s.[283]
Religion
The CIA estimated in 2009 that 99.7% of the Afghan population was Muslim[10] and most are thought to
adhere to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni"] Sunni [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanafi"] Hanafi school.[286] According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center"] Pew Research Center, as much as 90% are of the
Sunni denomination, 7% [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia"] Shia and 3% [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-denominational_Muslim"] non-denominational.[287] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA"] CIA Factbook variously estimates up
to 89.7% Sunni or up to 15% Shia.[10] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Izady"] Michael Izady estimated 70% of the population to be followers of
Sunni Islam, 25% [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imamiyyah"] Imami Shia Islam, 4.5% [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isma%27ilism"] Ismaili Shia Islam, and 0.5% [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Afghanistan#Minority_religious_groups"] other religions.[288]
Afghan [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism_in_Afghanistan"] Sikhs and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism_in_Afghanistan"] Hindus are also found in certain major cities (namely Kabul, Jalalabad, Ghazni,
Kandahar)[289][290] accompanied by gurdwaras and mandirs.[291] According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Welle"] Deutsche Welle in
September 2021, 250 remain in the country after 67 were evacuated to India.[292]
Page 20
There was a small [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Afghanistan"] Jewish community in Afghanistan, living mainly
in Herat and Kabul. Over the years, this small community was
forced leave due to decades of warfare and religious persecution.
By the end of the twentieth century, the entire community had
emigrated to Israel and the United States, with the exception of one
person, Herat-born [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zablon_Simintov"] Zablon Simintov. He remained for years, being
the caretaker of the only remaining Afghan synagogue.[293] After
the second Taliban takeover, he left Afghanistan for the United
States.[294]
 Afghan Christians, who number 500–8,000, practice their faith
secretly due to intense societal opposition, and there are no public
churches.[295][296] 
 Blue Mosque in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazar-i-Sharif"] Mazar-i-Sharif is the

Urbanization
As estimated by the CIA World Factbook, 26% of the population was urbanized as of 2020. This is one of
the lowest figures in the world; in Asia it is only higher than Cambodia, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal"] Nepal and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka"] Sri Lanka. Urbanization
has increased rapidly, particularly in the capital Kabul, due to returning refugees from Pakistan and Iran
after 2001, internally displaced people, and rural migrants.[297] Urbanization in Afghanistan is different
from typical urbanization in that it is centered on just a few cities.[298]
The only city with over a million residents is its capital, Kabul, located in the east of the country. The other
large cities are located generally in the "ring" around the Central Highlands, namely [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar"] Kandahar in the south,
 Herat in the west, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazar-i-Sharif"] Mazar-i-Sharif and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz"] Kunduz in the north, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalalabad"] Jalalabad in the east.[271]

Education
 Education in Afghanistan includes K–12 and higher education, which is overseen by the Ministry of
Education and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Higher_Education_(Afghanistan)"] Ministry of Higher Education. There are over 16,000 schools in the country and roughly
9 million students. Of this, about 60% are males and 40% females. However, the new regime has thus far
forbidden girls and female teachers from returning to secondary schools.[300][301] Over 174,000 students
are enrolled in different [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_universities_in_Afghanistan"] universities around the country. About 21% of these are females.[302] Former
Education Minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghulam_Farooq_Wardak"] Ghulam Farooq Wardak had stated that construction of 8,000 schools is required for the
remaining children who are deprived of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_learning"] formal learning.[303] As of 2018 the literacy rate of the population
Page 21
age 15 and older is 43.02% (males 55.48% and females
29.81%).[304]
 The top universities in Afghanistan are the American
 University of Afghanistan (AUAF) followed by Kabul
University (KU), both of which are located in Kabul. The
 National Military Academy of Afghanistan, modeled after the
 United States Military Academy at West Point, was a four-year
military development institution dedicated to graduating
 officers for the Afghan Armed Forces. The Afghan Defense UNESCO Institute of Statistics
University was constructed near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qargha"] Qargha in Kabul. Major Afghanistan Literacy Rate population
universities outside of Kabul include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_University"] Kandahar University in  plus15 1980–2018

and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz_University"] Kunduz University in the north, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nangarhar_University"] Nangarhar University and
 Khost University in the east. Kabul University was founded in 1932 and is a respected institute that played
a significant part in the country's education;[305] from the 1960s the Kabul University was also a hotbed of
radical political ideologies such as Marxism and Islamism, which played major parts in society, politics and
the war that began in 1978.[306]
After the Taliban regained power in 2021, it became unclear to what extent female education would
continue in the country. In March 2022, after they had been closed for some time, it was announced that
girl's schools after 6th grade would be reopened shortly. However, shortly before reopening, the order was
rescinded and schools for older girls remained closed.[307]
Health
According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index"] Human Development Index, Afghanistan is the
 15th least developed country in the world. The average life
expectancy is estimated to be around 60 years.[308][309] The
country's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_mortality"] maternal mortality rate is 396 deaths/100,000 live births
and its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality"] infant mortality rate is 66[309] to 112.8 deaths in every 1,000
live births.[10] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Public_Health_(Afghanistan)"] Ministry of Public Health plans to cut the infant
mortality rate to 400 for every 100,000 live births before 2020. The
country has more than 3,000 midwives, with an additional 300 to
400 being trained each year.[310] 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daoud_Khan_Military_Hospital"] Daoud Khan Military Hospital in
Kabul is one of the largest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hospitals_in_Afghanistan"] hospitals
There are over 100 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitals_in_Afghanistan"] hospitals in Afghanistan,[311] with the most 
in Afghanistan
 advanced treatments being available in Kabul. The French Medical
Institute for Children and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi_Children%27s_Hospital"] Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital in Kabul are the leading [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_hospital"] children's hospitals in
 the country. Some of the other leading hospitals in Kabul include the Jamhuriat Hospital and Jinnah
Hospital.[312] In spite of all this, many Afghans travel to Pakistan and India for advanced treatment.
It was reported in 2006 that nearly 60% of the Afghan population lives within a two-hour walk of the
nearest health facility.[313] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability"] Disability rate is also high in Afghanistan due to the decades of war.[314] It was
reported recently that about 80,000 people are missing limbs.[315][316] Non-governmental charities such as
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_the_Children"] Save the Children and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahboba%27s_Promise"] Mahboba's Promise assist orphans in association with governmental structures.[317]

others to conduct a survey in Afghanistan focusing on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_death"] maternal death, among other things.[318]
Governance
Page 22
 Following the effective collapse of the Islamic Republic of
Afghanistan during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive"] 2021 Taliban offensive, the Taliban declared
the country an Islamic Emirate. A new caretaker government was
announced on 7 September.[319] As of 8 September 2021, no other
country had formally recognized the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as
the de jure government of Afghanistan.[320]
A traditional instrument of governance in Afghanistan is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loya_jirga"] loya jirga
(grand assembly),  a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtun"] Pashtun consultative meeting that was mainly
organized for choosing a new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state"] head of state, adopting a new
constitution, or to settle national or regional issue such as war.[321]
Loya jirgas have been held since at least 1747,[322] with the most
recent one occurring in August 2020.[323][324]

Development of Taliban government
On 17 August 2021, the leader of the Taliban-affiliated
 Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin party, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulbuddin_Hekmatyar"] Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, met
 with both Hamid Karzai, the former President of
Afghanistan, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_Abdullah"] Abdullah Abdullah, the former chairman of
the High Council for National Reconciliation and former
 Chief Executive, in Doha, Qatar, with the aim of forming a
 national unity government.[325][326] President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani"] Ashraf Ghani,
having fled the country during the Taliban advance to either
 Tajikistan or Uzbekistan, emerged in the United Arab
Emirates and said that he supported such negotiations and
was in talks to return to Afghanistan.[327][328] Many figures
within the Taliban generally agreed that continuation of the
 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan may, if correctly applied,
be workable as the basis for the new religious state as their
objections to the former government were political, and not
religious.[329]

by CNN-News18, sources said the new government was going to be governed similarly to Iran with
Haibatullah Akhundzada as supreme leader similar to the role of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Khamenei"] Saayid Ali Khamenei, and would be
based out of Kandahar. Baradar or Yaqoob would be head of government as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister"] Prime Minister. The
government's ministries and agencies will be under a cabinet presided over by the Prime Minister. The
Supreme Leader would preside over an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)"] executive body known Supreme Council with anywhere from 11 to
Page 23
72 members. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdul_Hakim_Ishaqzai"] Abdul Hakim Ishaqzai is likely to be promoted
to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_justice"] Chief Justice. According to the report, the new
government will take place within the framework of an
amended [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_Constitution_of_Afghanistan"] 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan.[331]
However, later interviews disclosed to News18 that
negotiations were not yet completed and that representatives
were still in Kandahar, and that the announcement of the new
government would not take place until 4 September or
later.[332][333][334] Government formation was further
delayed with the announcement postponed to some time
during the week of 6 September, due to concerns about
forming a broad-based government acceptable to the
international community.[335] It was later added however that
the Taliban's Rahbari Shura, the group's leadership council
was divided between the hardline Haqqani Network and

moderate Abdul Ghani Baradar over appointments needed to
form an "inclusive" government. This culminated in a skirmish which led to Baradar being injured and
treated in Pakistan.[336] It was speculated that the government would be announced on 11 September 2021,
the 20th anniversary of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9/11_attacks"] 9/11 attacks, with invitations possibly being extended to the governments of
Turkey, China, Iran, Pakistan, and Qatar.[337]
As of early September, the Taliban were planning the Cabinet to be men-only, stating that women would
not be allowed to "work in high-ranking posts" in the government and that women were "ruled out" from
the Cabinet. Journalists and other human rights activists, mostly women, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Afghan_protests"] protested in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herat"] Herat and Kabul,
calling for women to be included in the Cabinet.[338] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Afghanistan#Islamic_Emirate_(2021%E2%80%93present)"] acting Cabinet announced on 7 September was
men-only, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Women%27s_Affairs_(Afghanistan)"] Ministry of Women's Affairs appeared to have been abolished.[319] On March 23, 2022,
there were reports a cabinet shakeup was underway as another meeting of the Leadership Council was held
in Kandahar for the second time since the Taliban Islamic Movement [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Kabul_(2021)"] came to power as a way to get
international recognition. The last meeting of the Leadership Council was held from August 28, 2021, to
August 30, 2021.[339][340]
Administrative divisions
Afghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilayat"] wilayat).[341] Each province has a governor and
a capital. The country is further divided into nearly 400 provincial districts, each of which normally covers
a city or several villages. Each district is represented by a district governor.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_governors_of_Afghanistan"] provincial governors are now appointed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Afghanistan"] Prime Minister of Afghanistan, and the district
governors are selected by the provincial governors.[342] The provincial governors are representatives of the
central government in Kabul and are responsible for all administrative and formal issues within their
provinces. There are also provincial councils that are elected through direct and general elections for four
years.[343] The functions of provincial councils are to take part in provincial development planning and to
participate in the monitoring and appraisal of other provincial governance institutions.
According to article 140 of the constitution and the presidential decree on electoral law, mayors of cities
should be elected through free and direct elections for a four-year term. In practice however, mayors are
appointed by the government.[344]

Foreign relations
Afghanistan became a member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"] United Nations in 1946.[345] Historically, Afghanistan had strong
relations with Germany, one of the first countries to recognize Afghanistan's independence in 1919; the
Soviet Union, which provided much aid and military training for Afghanistan's forces and includes the
signing of a Treaty of Friendship in 1921 and 1978; and India, with which a friendship treaty was signed in
1950.[346] Relations with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan%E2%80%93Pakistan_relations"] Pakistan have often been tense for various reasons such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durand_Line"] Durand Line
border issue and alleged Pakistani involvement in Afghan insurgent groups.

The present Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is currently internationally unrecognized, but has had notable
unofficial ties with China, Pakistan, and Qatar.[347][348] Under the previous Islamic Republic of
 Afghanistan, it enjoyed cordial relations with a number of NATO and allied nations, particularly the United
States, Canada, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan%E2%80%93United_Kingdom_relations"] United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and Turkey. In 2012, the United States and the
then-republic in Afghanistan signed their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US%E2%80%93Afghanistan_Strategic_Partnership_Agreement"] Strategic Partnership Agreement in which Afghanistan became a
 major non-NATO ally.[349]
Military
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_the_Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan"] Armed Forces of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan captured a large amount of weapons, hardware,
vehicles, aerocrafts, and equipment from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Armed_Forces"] Afghan Armed Forces following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Taliban_offensive"] 2021 Taliban offensive
and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Kabul_(2021)"] Fall of Kabul. The total value of the captured equipment has been estimated at US$83
billion.[350][351]
Human rights
Homosexuality is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo"] taboo in Afghan society;[352] according to the Penal Code, homosexual intimacy is
 punished by up to a year in prison.[353] With implementing Sharia law offenders can be punished by
death.[354][355] However an ancient tradition involving male homosexual acts between youngsters and
older men (typically wealthy or elite people) called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacha_bazi"] bacha bazi persists.
Religious minorities such as Sikhs,[356] Hindus,[357] and Christians have reportedly faced persecution in
the country.[358][359]
Since May 2022, all women in Afghanistan have been required by law to wear full-body coverings when
in public (either a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa"] burqa or an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaya"] abaya paired with a niqāb, which leaves only the eyes uncovered).[360][361]
In a May interview with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiane_Amanpour"] Christiane Amanpour, First [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Leader_of_the_Islamic_Emirate_of_Afghanistan"] Deputy Leader [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirajuddin_Haqqani"] Sirajuddin Haqqani claimed the decree
is only advisory and no form of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab"] hijab is compulsory in Afghanistan,[362] though this contradicts the
reality.[363] It has been speculated that there is a genuine internal policy division over women's rights
between hardliners, including Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada, and pragmatists, though they publicly
present a united front.[364] Another decree was issued shortly after the first, requiring female TV presenters
to cover their faces during broadcasts.[365]
In May 2022, the Taliban dissolved Afghanistan's Human Rights Commission along with four other
government departments, citing the country's budget deficit.[366]
Economy
Afghanistan's nominal GDP was $21.7 billion in 2018, or $72.9 billion by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity"] purchasing power parity
(PPP).[20] Its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita"] GDP per capita is $2,024 (PPP).[20] Despite having $1 trillion or more in mineral
deposits,[367] it remains one of the world's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_developed_countries"] least developed countries. Afghanistan's rough physical
geography and its landlocked status has been cited as reasons why the country has always been among the
least developed in the modern era – a factor where progress is also slowed by contemporary conflict and
political instability.[249] The country imports over $7 billion worth of goods but exports only $784 million,
mainly fruits and nuts. It has $2.8 billion in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_debt"] external debt.[10] The service sector contributed the most to the
GDP (55.9%) followed by agriculture (23%) and industry (21.1%).[368]

While the nation's current account deficit is largely financed with
donor money, only a small portion is provided directly to the
government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary
expenditure and donor-designated projects through the United
Nations system and non-governmental organizations.[369]

One of the main drivers for
the current economic recovery is the return of over 5 million
expatriates, who brought with them entrepreneurship and wealth-
creating skills as well as much needed funds to start up businesses.
Many Afghans are now involved in construction, which is one of
the largest industries in the country.[372] Some of the major national
construction projects include the $35 billion New Kabul City next
 to the capital, the Aino Mena project in Kandahar, and the Ghazi
Amanullah Khan Town near Jalalabad.[373][374][375] Similar 
 Afghan rugs are one of Afghanistan's
main exports
development projects have also begun in Herat, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazar-e-Sharif"] Mazar-e-Sharif,
and other cities.[376] An estimated 400,000 people enter the labor market each year.[377]
Several small companies and factories began operating in different parts of the country, which not only
provide revenues to the government but also create new jobs. Improvements to the business environment
have resulted in more than $1.5 billion in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunication"] telecom investment and created more than 100,000 jobs since
2003.[378] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_rug"] Afghan rugs are becoming popular again, allowing many carpet dealers around the country to
hire more workers; in 2016–17 it was the fourth most exported group of items.[379]
Afghanistan is a member of WTO, SAARC, ECO, and OIC. It holds an observer status in SCO. In 2018, a
majority of imports come from either Iran, China, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, while 84% of exports are to
Pakistan and India.[380]
Since the Taliban's takeover of the country in August 2021, the United States has [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_frozen_assets"] frozen about $9 billion in
assets belonging to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Afghanistan_Bank"] Afghan central bank,[381] blocking the Taliban from accessing billions of dollars
held in U.S. bank accounts.[382][383]
Agriculture
Agricultural production is the backbone of Afghanistan's economy[384] and has traditionally dominated the
economy, employing about 40% of the workforce as of 2018.[385] The country is known for producing
pomegranates, grapes, apricots, melons, and several other fresh and dry fruits. It is also known as the
world's largest producer of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_production_in_Afghanistan"] opium – as much as 16% or more of the nation's economy is derived from the
cultivation and sale of opium.[386] It is also one of the world's top producers of cannabis.[387]
Saffron, the most expensive spice, grows in Afghanistan, particularly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herat_Province"] Herat Province. In recent years, there
has been an uptick in saffron production, which authorities and farmers trying to replace poppy cultivation.
Between 2012 and 2019, the saffron cultivated and produced in Afghanistan was consecutively ranked the
Page 27
world's  best by the International Taste and Quality
Institute.[388][389] Production hit record high in 2019 (19,469 kg of
saffron), and one kilogram is sold domestically between $634 and
$1147.[390]
The availability of cheap diesel-powered water pumps imported
from China and Pakistan, and in the 2010s, of cheap solar power to
pump water, resulted in expansion of agriculture and population in
the southwestern deserts of Afghanistan in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_Province"] Kandahar Province,
 Helmand Province and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimruz_Province"] Nimruz Province in the 2010s. Wells have
gradually been deepened, but water resources are limited. Opium is

as the world's best
the major crop, but as of 2022, was under attack by the new
Taliban government which, in order to suppress opium production, was systematically suppressing water
pumping.[391][392]
Mining 
The country's natural resources include: coal, copper, iron ore, lithium,
uranium, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_earth_element"] rare earth elements, chromite, gold, zinc, talc, barite, sulfur, lead,
marble, precious and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-precious_stones"] semi-precious stones, natural gas, and
petroleum.[393][394] In 2010, US and Afghan government officials
 estimated that untapped mineral deposits located in 2007 by the US
Geological Survey are worth at least $1 trillion.[395]
 Michael E. O'Hanlon of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brookings_Institution"] Brookings Institution estimated that if
Afghanistan generates about $10 billion per year from its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_in_Afghanistan"] mineral deposits,
its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_national_product"] gross national product would double and provide long-term funding for
 Afghan security forces and other critical needs.[396] The United States
 Lapis lazuli stones 
Geological Survey (USGS) estimated in 2006 that northern Afghanistan
has an average 460 million m3 (2.9 billion bbl) of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_oil"] crude oil, 440 billion m3
(15.7 trillion cu ft) of natural gas, and 67 billion L (562 million US bbl) of
 natural gas liquids.[397] In 2011, Afghanistan signed an oil exploration
contract with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Petroleum_Corporation"] China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) for the development of three oil fields along
the Amu Darya river in the north.[398]
The country has significant amounts of lithium, copper, gold, coal, iron ore, and other
minerals.[393][394][399] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanashin"] Khanashin [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonatite"] carbonatite in Helmand Province contains 1,000,000 tonnes

for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mes_Aynak#Copper_Mine"] Aynak copper mine to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Metallurgical_Group"] China Metallurgical Group for $3 billion,[401] making it the biggest
 foreign investment and private business venture in Afghanistan's history.[402] The state-run Steel Authority
of India won the mining rights to develop the huge [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajigak_Pass"] Hajigak iron ore deposit in central Afghanistan.[403]
Government officials estimate that 30% of the country's untapped mineral deposits are worth at least
$1 trillion.[395] One official asserted that "this will become the backbone of the Afghan economy" and a
Pentagon memo stated that Afghanistan could become the "Saudi Arabia of lithium".[404] The lithium
reserves of 21 Mio. tons could amount to the ones of Bolivia, which is currently viewed as the country with
the largest lithium reserves.[405] Other larger deposits are the ones of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauxite"] Bauxit and Cobalt.[405] In a 2011
news story, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Christian_Science_Monitor"] CSM reported, "The United States and other Western nations that have borne the brunt of
the cost of the Afghan war have been conspicuously absent from the bidding process on Afghanistan's
mineral deposits, leaving it mostly to regional powers."[406]

Access to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biocapacity"] biocapacity in Afghanistan is lower than world average. In 2016, Afghanistan had 0.43 global
hectares[407] of biocapacity per person within its territory, much less than the world average of 1.6 global
hectares per person.[408] In 2016 Afghanistan used 0.73 global hectares of biocapacity per person - their
 ecological footprint of consumption. This means they use just under double as much biocapacity as
Afghanistan contains. As a result, Afghanistan is running a biocapacity deficit.[407]
Infrastructure
Energy
According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank"] World Bank, 98% of the rural population have
access to electricity in 2018, up from 28% in 2008.[409] Overall the
figure stands at 98.7%.[410] As of 2016, Afghanistan produces
1,400 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megawatt"] megawatts of power, but still imports the majority of
electricity via transmission lines from Iran and the Central Asian
states.[411] The majority of electricity production is via
hydropower, helped by the amount of rivers and streams that flow
from the mountains.[412] However electricity is not always reliable
and blackouts happen, including in Kabul.[413] In recent years an
increasing number of solar, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass"] biomass and wind power plants have
been constructed.[414] Currently under development are the

Tourism 
Tourism is a small industry in Afghanistan due to security issues.
Nevertheless, some 20,000 foreign tourists visit the country
annually as of 2016.[415] In particular an important region for
domestic and international tourism is the picturesque [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamyan"] Bamyan
Valley, which includes lakes, canyons and historical sites, helped
by the fact it is in a safe area away from insurgent activity.[416][417]
Smaller numbers visit and trek in regions such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakhan"] Wakhan
 Band-e Amir National Park 
Valley, which is also one of the world's  most remote
communities.[418] From the late 1960s onwards, Afghanistan was a
popular stop on the famous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippie_trail"] hippie trail, attracting many Europeans
and Americans. Coming from Iran, the trail traveled through various Afghan provinces and cities including
Herat, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar"] Kandahar and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul"] Kabul before crossing to northern Pakistan, northern India, and Nepal.[419][420]
Tourism peaked in 1977, the year before the start of political instability and armed conflict.[421]
The city of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghazni"] Ghazni has significant history and historical sites, and together with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamyan"] Bamyan city have in recent
years been voted Islamic Cultural Capital and South Asia Cultural Capital respectively.[422] The cities of
Herat, Kandahar, Balkh, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaranj"] Zaranj are also very historic. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minaret_of_Jam"] Minaret of Jam in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_River,_Afghanistan"] Hari River valley is a
 UNESCO World Heritage Site. A cloak reputedly worn by Islam's prophet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad"] Muhammad is kept inside the
 Shrine of the Cloak in Kandahar, a city founded by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great"] Alexander the Great and the first capital of
Page 29
Afghanistan. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_of_Alexander"] citadel of Alexander in the western city of Herat has been
renovated in recent years and is a popular attraction. In the north of the
country is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrine_of_Ali"] Shrine of Ali, believed by many to be the location where [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali"] Ali
was buried.[423] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Afghanistan"] National Museum of Afghanistan is located in Kabul
and hosts a large number of Buddhist, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactria"] Bactrian Greek and early Islamic
antiquities; the museum suffered greatly by civil war but has been slowly
restoring since the early 2000s.[424]
Communication
 Telecommunication services in Afghanistan are provided by Afghan
Telecom, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_Wireless"] Afghan Wireless, Etisalat, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTN_Group"] MTN Group, and Roshan. The
country uses its own space [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite"] satellite called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghansat_1"] Afghansat 1, which provides
services to millions of phone, internet, and television subscribers. By 2001
following years of civil war, telecommunications was virtually a non-
existent sector, but by 2016 it had grown to a $2 billion industry, with
22 million mobile phone subscribers and 5 million internet users. The sector
employs at least 120,000 people nationwide.[425] 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minaret_of_Jam"] Minaret of Jam is a
 UNESCO World Heritage
Site, currently under threat

Transportation 
Due to Afghanistan's geography, transport between various parts of
the country has historically been difficult. The backbone of
Afghanistan's road network is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highway_1_(Afghanistan)"] Highway 1, often called the "Ring
Road",  which extends for 2,210 kilometers (1,370 mi) and
connects five major cities: Kabul, Ghazni, Kandahar, Herat and
Mazar-i-Sharif,[426] with spurs to Kunduz and Jalalabad and

tunnel in the world, provides a key
connection between the north and
south of the country 
The Ring Road is crucially important for domestic and international
trade and the economy.[428] A key portion of the Ring Road is the
 Salang Tunnel, completed in 1964, which facilitates travel through
the Hindu Kush mountain range and connects northern and
 southern Afghanistan.[429] It is the only land route that connects Central Asia to the Indian
subcontinent.[430] Several mountain passes allow travel between the Hindu Kush in other areas. Serious
traffic accidents are common on Afghan roads and highways, particularly on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul%E2%80%93Kandahar_Highway"] Kabul–Kandahar and the
 Kabul–Jalalabad Road.[431] Traveling by bus in Afghanistan remains dangerous due to militant
activities.[432]
Air transport in Afghanistan is provided by the national carrier, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariana_Afghan_Airlines"] Ariana Afghan Airlines,[433] and by the
private company [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kam_Air"] Kam Air. Airlines from a number of countries also provide flights in and out of the
country. These include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_India"] Air India, Emirates, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Air"] Gulf Air, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Aseman_Airlines"] Iran Aseman Airlines, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_International_Airlines"] Pakistan International Airlines,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Airlines"] Turkish Airlines. The country has four international airports: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamid_Karzai_International_Airport"] Hamid Karzai International Airport
(formerly Kabul International Airport), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kandahar_International_Airport"] Kandahar International Airport, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herat_International_Airport"] Herat International Airport, and
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazar-e_Sharif_International_Airport"] Mazar-e Sharif International Airport. Including domestic airports, there are 43.[10] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagram_Air_Base"] Bagram Air Base is a
major military airfield.
Page 30
The country has three rail links: one, a 75-kilometer (47 mi) line
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazar-i-Sharif"] Mazar-i-Sharif to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan%E2%80%93Uzbekistan_Friendship_Bridge"] Uzbekistan border;[434] a 10-kilometer
(6.2 mi) long line from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toraghundi"] Toraghundi to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmenistan"] Turkmenistan border
(where it continues as part of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkmen_Railways"] Turkmen Railways); and a short link
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqina"] Aqina across the Turkmen border to Kerki, which is planned
to be extended further across Afghanistan.[435] These lines are used
for freight only and there is no passenger service. A rail line
between Khaf, Iran and Herat, western Afghanistan, intended for
both freight and passengers, is under construction as of
2019.[436][437] About 125 kilometers (78 mi) of the line will lie on
the Afghan side.[438][439] There are various proposals for the
construction of additional rail lines in the country.[440]

Private vehicle ownership has increased substantially since the early 2000s. Taxis are yellow in color and
consist of both cars and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_rickshaw"] auto rickshaws.[441] In rural Afghanistan, villagers often use donkeys, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule"] mules or
 horses to transport or carry goods. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel"] Camels are primarily used by the Kochi nomads.[265] Bicycles are
popular throughout Afghanistan.[442]
Culture
 Afghans have both common cultural features and those that differ
between the regions of Afghanistan, each with distinctive cultures
partly as a result of geographic obstacles that divide the
country.[249] Family is the mainstay of Afghan society and families
are often headed by a patriarch.[443] In the southern and eastern
region, the people live according to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtun_culture"] Pashtun culture by
following [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashtunwali"] Pashtunwali (the Pashtun way).[444] Key tenets of
Pashtunwali include hospitality, the provision of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanawatai"] sanctuary to those
seeking refuge, and revenge for the shedding of blood.[445] The
Pashtuns are largely connected to the culture of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"] Central Asia and
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Plateau"] Iranian Plateau. The remaining Afghans are culturally [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persianization"] Persian
and Turkic. Some non-Pashtuns who live in proximity with 
An Afghan family near Kholm, 1939
– most Afghans are tribal
Pashtuns have adopted Pashtunwali in a  process called
Pashtunization, while some Pashtuns have been Persianized. Those who have lived in Pakistan and Iran
over the last 30 years have been further influenced by the cultures of those neighboring nations. The
Afghan people are known to be strongly religious.[286]
Afghans, particularly Pashtuns, are noted for their tribal solidarity and high regard for personal honor.[446]
One writer considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country
that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an
uncomplicated lifestyle.[447] There are various [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Afghanistan"] Afghan tribes, and an estimated 2–3 million nomads.[448]
Afghan culture is deeply Islamic,[449] but pre-Islamic practices persist.[450] One example is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacha_bazi"] bacha bazi, a
term for activities involving sexual relations between older men and younger adolescent men, or boys.[451]
 Child marriage is prevalent in Afghanistan;[452] the legal age for marriage is 16.[453] The most preferred
 marriage in Afghan society is to one's parallel cousin, and the groom is often expected to pay a bride
price.[454]
In the villages, families typically occupy [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudbrick"] mudbrick houses, or compounds with mudbrick or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_wall"] stone walled
houses. Villages typically have a headman (malik), a master for water distribution (mirab) and a religious

covering; some women, typically from highly conservative
communities, wear the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burqa"] burqa, a full body covering. These were
worn by some women of the Pashtun community well before Islam
came to the region, but the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban"] Taliban enforced this dress on women
when they were in power.[455] Another popular dress is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapan"] chapan

Architecture
The nation has a complex history that has survived either in

ages, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece"] Greek and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist"] Buddhist stupas, monasteries,
monuments, temples and Islamic minarets. Among the most

contemporary buildings
famous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhas_of_Bamiyan"] Buddhas of Bamiyan were destroyed by the Taliban,
who regarded them as idolatrous. Despite that, archaeologists are still finding Buddhist relics in different
parts of the country, some of them dating back to the 2nd century.[461] As there was no colonialism in the
modern era in Afghanistan, European-style architecture is rare but does exist: the Victory Arch at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paghman"] Paghman
and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darul_Aman_Palace"] Darul Aman Palace in Kabul were built in this style in the 1920s by the Afghans themselves.

Carpets have been produced in the region for thousands of years
and traditionally done by women.[462] Some crafters express their
feelings through the designs of rugs; for example after the outbreak
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Afghan_War"] Soviet–Afghan War, "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_rugs"] war rugs", a variant of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_rug"] Afghan rugs,
were created with designs representing pain and misery caused by
the conflict.[463] Every province has its own specific characteristics
in making rugs.[464] In some of the Turkic-populated areas in the
north-west, bride and wedding ceremony prices are driven by the
bride's weaving skills.[465]

Afghan cuisine is largely based upon the nation's chief crops, such
as wheat, maize, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley"] barley and rice. Accompanying these staples are
native fruits and vegetables as well as dairy products such as milk,
 yogurt and whey. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuli_palaw"] Kabuli palaw is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_dish"] national dish of

Literature 
 Non (bread) from a local baker, the
most widely consumed bread in
Afghanistan
Classic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_literature"] Persian and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashto_poetry"] Pashto poetry are a cherished part of Afghan culture. Poetry has always been one of the
major educational pillars in the region, to the level that it has integrated itself into culture.[488] One of the
poetic styles is called landay. A popular theme in Afghan folklore and mythology are Divs, monstrous
creatures.[489] Thursdays are traditionally "poetry night" in the city of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herat"] Herat when men, women and

the 13th century, considered the persophonist throughout the world as the greatest mystical poet of the
entire Muslim world. The Afghan Pashto literature, although quantitatively remarkable and in great growth
in the last century, has always had an essentially local meaning and importance, feeling the influence of
both Persian literature and the contiguous literatures of India. Both main literatures, from the second half of
the nineteenth century, have shown themselves to be sensitive to genres (novel, theater), movements and
stylistic features imported from Europe.
 Khushal Khan Khattak of the 17th century is considered the national poet. Other notable poets include
 Rabi'a Balkhi, Jami, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahman_Baba"] Rahman Baba, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalilullah_Khalili"] Khalilullah Khalili, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parween_Pazhwak"] Parween Pazhwak.[491]

(Megasthenes and Arrian, p 180. See also: Alexander's Invasion of India, p 38; J.W.
McCrindle).
"Even the name Afghan is Aryan being derived from Asvakayana, an important clan of
the Asvakas or horsemen who must have derived this title from their handling of
celebrated breeds of horses" (See: Imprints of Indian Thought and Culture Abroad, p
124, Vivekananda Kendra Prakashan).
cf: "Their name (Afghan) means "cavalier" being derived from the Sanskrit, Asva, or
Asvaka, a horse, and shows that their country must have been noted in ancient times, as
it is at the present day, for its superior breed of horses. Asvaka was an important tribe
settled north to Kabul river, which offered a gallant resistance but ineffectual resistance
to the arms of Alexander "(Ref: Scottish Geographical Magazine, 1999, p 275, Royal
Scottish Geographical Society).

scarcely modified in the Assakani or Assakeni of the historians of the expedition of
Alexander" (Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Indian"] Anglo-Indian words and phrases,

"During the intervening fourteen years of Communist rule, an estimated 1.5 to 2 million
Afghan civilians were killed by Soviet forces and their proxies- the four Communist regimes
in Kabul, and the East Germans, Bulgarians, Czechs, Cubans, Palestinians, Indians and
others who assisted them. These were not battle casualties or the unavoidable civilian
victims of warfare. Soviet and local Communist forces seldom attacked the scattered guerilla
bands of the Afghan Resistance except, in a few strategic locales like the Panjsher valley.
Instead they deliberately targeted the civilian population, primarily in the rural areas."
