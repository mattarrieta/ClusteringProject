Saudi Arabia,[c] officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
 (KSA),[d] is a country on the Arabian Peninsula in Western
Asia. It has a land area of about 2,150,000 km2
(830,000 sq mi), making it the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Asian_countries_by_area"] fifth-largest country in Asia,
the second-largest in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world"] Arab world, and the largest in
Western Asia. It is bordered by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea"] Red Sea to the west;
Jordan, Iraq, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait"] Kuwait to the north; the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf"] Persian Gulf,
 Qatar and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates"] United Arab Emirates to the east; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman"] Oman to the
southeast; and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen"] Yemen to the south. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain"] Bahrain is an island
country off the east coast. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aqaba"] Gulf of Aqaba in the
northwest separates Saudi Arabia from Egypt. Saudi Arabia
is the only country with a coastline along both the Red Sea
and the Persian Gulf, and most of its terrain consists of arid
 desert, lowland, steppe, and mountains. Its capital and largest
city is Riyadh. The country is home to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca"] Mecca and Medina,
the two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiest_sites_in_Islam"] holiest cities in Islam.
 Pre-Islamic Arabia, the territory that constitutes modern-day
Saudi Arabia, was the site of several ancient cultures and
civilizations; the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory_of_Saudi_Arabia"] prehistory of Saudi Arabia shows some of
the earliest traces of human activity in the world.[16] The
world's second-largest religion,[17] Islam, emerged in what is
now Saudi Arabia. In the early 7th century, the Islamic
prophet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad"] Muhammad united the population of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabia"] Arabia and
created a single Islamic religious polity.[18] Following his
death in 632, his followers rapidly expanded the territory
 under Muslim rule beyond Arabia, conquering huge and
 unprecedented swathes of territory (from the Iberian
Peninsula in the west to parts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"] Central and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"] South Asia in
the east) in a matter of decades. Arab dynasties originating
from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidun_Caliphate"] Rashidun (632–
661),  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate"] Umayyad (661–750),  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_Caliphate"] Abbasid (750–1517),  and
 Fatimid (909–1171) caliphates, as well as numerous other
dynasties in Asia, Africa, and Europe.
The area of modern-day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of
mainly four distinct historical regions: Hejaz, Najd, and parts
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Arabia"] Eastern Arabia (Al-Ahsa) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Arabia"] Southern Arabia ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Asir_Region"] 'Asir).[19]
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by
King Abdulaziz (known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Saud"] Ibn Saud in the West). He united
the four regions into a single state through a series of
conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the
ancestral home of his family, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Saud"] Al Saud. Saudi Arabia has
since been an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy"] absolute monarchy, where the king, the
princes of the large Al Saud royal family and the country’s
traditional elites have overseen a highly authoritarian
regime.[20][21][22] The ultraconservative [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabi"] Wahhabi religious
movement within [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam"] Sunni Islam has been described as a
"predominant feature of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_culture"] Saudi culture",[20][21] although the
power of the religious establishment has been significantly

eroded in the 2010s.[23] In its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law_of_Saudi_Arabia"] Basic Law, Saudi Arabia
continues to define itself as a sovereign Arab [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_state"] Islamic state
with Islam as its official religion, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language"] Arabic as its official
language, and Riyadh as its capital. Saudi Arabia is
sometimes called "the Land of the Two Holy Mosques" in
 reference to Al-Masjid al-Haram (in Mecca) and Al-Masjid
an-Nabawi (in Medina), the two holiest places in Islam.
Petroleum was discovered on 3 March 1938 and followed
up by several other finds in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Province,_Saudi_Arabia"] Eastern Province.[24][25]
Saudi Arabia has since become the world's second-largest oil
producer (behind the US) and the world's largest oil
exporter, controlling the world's second-largest oil reserves
and the sixth largest gas reserves.[26] The kingdom is
categorized as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_high-income_economy"] World Bank high-income economy with a
very high [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index"] Human Development Index[27] and is the only
Arab country to be part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20_major_economies"] G20 major economies.[28][29]
The kingdom spends 8% of its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP"] GDP on the military (highest
in the world after Oman),[30] which places it as the world's
third biggest military spender behind the United States and
China,[31] and the world's largest arms importer from 2015
to 2019, receiving half of all the US arms exports to the
Middle East.[32][33] According to the BICC, Saudi Arabia is
the 28th most militarized country in the world and possesses
the second-best military equipment qualitatively in the
region, after Israel.[34] By the late 2010s, there have been
continual calls for halting of arms sales to Saudi Arabia,
mainly due to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen#Reports_of_war_crimes"] alleged war crimes in Yemen[35] and
 especially following the assassination of Jamal
Khashoggi.[36][37] The state has attracted criticism for a
variety of reasons, including its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen"] role in the Yemeni Civil War,
 alleged sponsorship of Islamic terrorism and its poor human
rights record, which has been characterized by the excessive
and often extrajudicial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Saudi_Arabia"] use of capital punishment,[38] failure
to adopt adequate measures against [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_Saudi_Arabia"] human trafficking, state-
sponsored [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_Saudi_Arabia"] discrimination against religious minorities and
atheists,[39][40] and antisemitism, and its strict interpretation
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia_law"] Sharia law.[41][42]
Saudi Arabia is considered both a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_power"] regional and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_power"] middle
power.[43][44] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_economy"] Saudi economy is the largest in the
Middle East and eighteenth-largest in the world.[45] Saudi
Arabia also has one of the world's youngest populations,
with approximately 50 per cent of its population of 34.2
million being under 25 years old.[46] In addition to being a
member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Cooperation_Council"] Gulf Cooperation Council, Saudi Arabia is an
active and founding member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"] United Nations,

Etymology
Following the amalgamation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hejaz"] Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd, the new state was named al-Mamlakah al-
ʿArabīyah as-Suʿūdīyah (a transliteration of ‎السعودية ‎العربية ‎المملكة in Arabic) by royal decree on 23 September
1932 by its founder, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Saud"] Abdulaziz bin Saud. Although this is normally translated as "the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia" in
Page 4
English,[47] it literally means "the Saudi Arab kingdom",[48] or "the Arab Saudi Kingdom".[49]
The word "Saudi" is derived from the element as-Saʿūdīyah in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language"] Arabic name of the country, which is a type of
adjective known as a nisba, formed from the dynastic name of the Saudi royal family, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saud"] Al Saud (Arabic: ‎سعود ‎آل).
Its inclusion expresses the view that the country is the personal possession of the royal family.[50][51] Al Saud is an
 Arabic name formed by adding the word Al, meaning "family of" or "House of",[52] to the personal name of an
ancestor. In the case of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Saud"] Al Saud, this is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saud_ibn_Muhammad_ibn_Muqrin"] Saud ibn Muhammad ibn Muqrin, the father of the dynasty's 18th-century
founder, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_bin_Saud"] Muhammad bin Saud.[53]
History
Prehistory
There is evidence that human habitation in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula"] Arabian Peninsula dates back to
about 125,000 years ago.[54] A 2011 study found that the first modern humans to
 spread east across Asia left Africa about 75,000 years ago across the Bab-el-
Mandeb connecting the Horn of Africa and Arabia.[55] The Arabian peninsula is
regarded as a central figure in the understanding of hominin evolution and
dispersals. Arabia underwent an extreme environmental fluctuation in the
 Quaternary that led to profound evolutionary and demographic changes. Arabia
has a rich [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Paleolithic"] Lower Paleolithic record, and the quantity of Oldowan-like sites in the
region indicate a significant role that Arabia had played in the early hominin
colonization of Eurasia.[56]
In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic"] Neolithic period, prominent cultures such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Magar"] Al-Magar, whose centre lay in
modern-day southwestern Najd flourished. Al-Magar could be considered a
"Neolithic Revolution" in human knowledge and handicraft skills.[57] The culture
is characterized as being one of the world's first to involve the widespread
domestication of animals, particularly the horse, during the Neolithic
period.[58][59] Aside from horses, animals such as sheep, goats, dogs, in particular
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saluki"] Saluki breed, ostriches, falcons and fish were discovered in the form of
stone statues and rock engravings. Al-Magar statues were made from local stone,
and it seems that the statues were fixed in a central building that might have had a
significant role in the social and religious life of the inhabitants.[60]

 In November 2017, hunting scenes showing images of the most likely domesticated dogs, resembling the Canaan
dog, wearing leashes were discovered in Shuwaymis, a hilly region of northwestern Saudi Arabia. These rock
engravings date back more than 8,000 years, making them the earliest depictions of dogs in the world.[61]
At the end of the 4th millennium BC, Arabia entered the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age"] Bronze Age after witnessing drastic transformations; metals
were widely used, and the period was characterized by its 2 m high burials which were simultaneously followed by
the existence of numerous temples, that included many free-standing sculptures originally painted with red
colours.[62]
In May 2021, archaeologists announced that a 350,000-year-old [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acheulean"] Acheulean site named An Nasim in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E1%B8%A4a%CA%BCil_Province"] Hail region
could be the oldest human habitation site in northern Saudi Arabia. The site was first discovered in 2015 using remote
sensing and palaeohydrological modelling. It contains paleolake deposits related with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Pleistocene"] Middle Pleistocene materials.
354 artefacts, hand axes and stone tools, flakes discovered by researchers provided information about tool-making
traditions of the earliest living man inhabited South-West Asia. Besides, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic"] Paleolithic artefacts are similar to material
remains uncovered at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acheulean"] Acheulean sites in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Nafud"] Nefud Desert.[63][64][65][66]

The earliest sedentary culture in Saudi Arabia dates back to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubaid_period"] Ubaid period, upon
discovering various pottery sherds at Dosariyah. Initial analysis of the discovery
concluded that the eastern province of Saudi Arabia was the homeland of the earliest
settlers of Mesopotamia, and by extension, the likely origin of the Sumerians.
However, experts such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Oates"] Joan Oates had the opportunity to see the Ubaid period
sherds in eastern Arabia and consequently conclude that the sherds date to the last
two phases of the Ubaid period (period three and four), while a handful of examples
could be classified roughly as either Ubaid 3 or Ubaid 2. Thus, the idea that colonists
from Saudi Arabia had emigrated to southern Mesopotamia and founded the region's
first sedentary culture was abandoned.[68]
Climatic change and the onset of aridity may have brought about the end of this phase
of settlement, as little archaeological evidence exists from the succeeding
millennium.[69] The settlement of the region picks up again in the period of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilmun"] Dilmun in
the early 3rd millennium. Known records from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk"] Uruk refer to a place called Dilmun,
associated on several occasions with copper, and in later periods it was a source of
imported woods in southern Mesopotamia. A number of scholars have suggested that
Dilmun originally designated the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, notably linked
with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an-Nussi and Umm ar-Ramadh in the
interior and Tarout on the coast. It is likely that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarout_Island"] Tarout Island was the main port and
the capital of Dilmun.[67] Mesopotamian inscribed clay tablets suggests that, in the

early period of Dilmun, a form of hierarchical organized political structure existed. In
1966, an earthwork in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarout"] Tarout exposed an ancient burial field that yielded a large, impressive statue dating to the
Dilmunite period (mid 3rd millennium BC). The statue was locally made under the strong Mesopotamian influence
on the artistic principle of Dilmun.[67]
By 2200 BC, the centre of Dilmun shifted for unknown reasons from Tarout and the Saudi Arabian mainland to the
island of Bahrain, and a highly developed settlement emerged there, where a laborious temple complex and thousands
of burial mounds dating to this period were discovered.[67]

By the late Bronze Age, a historically recorded people and land (Midian and
the Midianites) in the north-western portion of Saudi Arabia are well-
documented in the Bible. Centred in Tabouk, it stretched from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadi_Arabah"] Wadi Arabah
in the north to the area of al-Wejh in the south.[70] The capital of Midian was
Qurayyah,[71] it consists of a large fortified citadel encompassing 35 hectares
and below it lies a walled settlement of 15 hectares. The city hosted as many
as 10 to 12 thousand inhabitants.[72] The Midianites were depicted in two
major events in the Bible that recount Israel's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midian_war"] two wars with Midian,
somewhere in the early 11th century BC. Politically, the Midianites were
described as having a decentralized structure headed by five kings (Evi,
Rekem, Tsur, Hur, and Reba), the names appears to be toponyms of important
Midianite settlements.[73] It is common to view that Midian designated a
confederation of tribes, the sedentary element settled in the Hijaz while its
nomadic affiliates pastured, and sometimes pillaged as far away land as
Palestine.[74] The nomadic Midianites were one of the earliest exploiters of
the domestication of camels that enabled them to navigate through the harsh
terrains of the region.[74]
At the end of the 7th century BC, an emerging kingdom appeared in the
historical theatre of north-western Arabia. It started as a Sheikdom of Dedan,
which developed into the Kingdom of Lihyan tribe.[75] The earliest attestation of state regality, King of Lihyan, was
in the mid-sixth century BC.[76] The second stage of the kingdom saw the transformation of Dedan from a mere city-
state of which only influence they exerted was inside their city walls, to a kingdom that encompasses much wider
domain that marked the pinnacle of Lihyan civilization.[75] The third state occurred during the early 3rd century BC
with bursting economic activity between the south and north that made Lihyan acquire large influence suitable to its
strategic position on the caravan road.[77]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz"]
Page 6
Lihyan was a powerful and highly organized ancient [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian"] Arabian kingdom that played a
vital cultural and economic role in the north-western region of the Arabian
Peninsula.[78] The Lihyanites ruled over a large domain from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina"] Yathrib in the south and
parts of the Levant in the north.[79] In antiquity, Gulf of Aqaba used to be called Gulf
of Lihyan. A testimony to the extensive influence that Lihyan acquired.[80]
The Lihyanites fell into the hands of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabataeans"] Nabataeans around 65 BC upon their seizure
of Hegra then marching to Tayma, and to their capital Dedan in 9 BC. The
Nabataeans ruled large portions of north Arabia until their domain was annexed by
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire"] Roman Empire, which renamed it [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabia_Petraea"] Arabia Petraea, and remained under the rule of
the Romans until 630.[81]

early 20th century, Mecca and Medina were under the control of a local Arab ruler known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharif_of_Mecca"] Sharif of Mecca, but
at most times the Sharif owed allegiance to the ruler of one of the major Islamic empires based in Baghdad, Cairo or
Istanbul. Most of the remainder of what became Saudi Arabia reverted to traditional tribal rule.[85][86]
For much of the 10th century, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isma%27ilism"] Isma'ili-Shi'ite [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qarmatians"] Qarmatians were the most powerful
force in the Persian Gulf. In 930, the Qarmatians pillaged Mecca, outraging the
Muslim world, particularly with their theft of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Stone"] Black Stone.[87] In 1077–1078, an
Arab Sheikh named [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_bin_Ali_Al_Uyuni"] Abdullah bin Ali Al Uyuni defeated the Qarmatians in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Arabia"] Bahrain
 and al-Hasa with the help of the Great Seljuq Empire and founded the Uyunid
dynasty.[88][89] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyunid_Emirate"] Uyunid Emirate later underwent expansion with its territory

In the 16th century, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottomans"] Ottomans added the Red Sea and Persian Gulf coast (the Hejaz, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27Asir_Province"] Asir and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Arabia"] Al-Ahsa) to the
Empire and claimed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzerainty"] suzerainty over the interior. One reason was to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_naval_expeditions_in_the_Indian_Ocean"] thwart Portuguese attempts to attack the Red Sea
(hence the Hejaz) and the Indian Ocean.[98] The Ottoman degree of control over these lands varied over the next four
centuries with the fluctuating strength or weakness of the Empire's central authority.[99][100] These changes
contributed to later uncertainties, such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Ma%27an"] dispute with Transjordan over the inclusion of the sanjak of Ma'an,
including the cities of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%27an"] Ma'an and Aqaba.
Foundation of the Saud dynasty
The emergence of what was to become the Saudi royal family, known as the
Al Saud, began in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nejd"] Nejd in central Arabia in February 1727,[101][102] when
 Muhammad bin Saud, founder of the dynasty, joined forces with the religious
leader [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Abd_al-Wahhab"] Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab,[103] founder of the Wahhabi
movement, a strict puritanical form of Sunni Islam.[104] This alliance formed
in the 18th century provided the ideological impetus to Saudi expansion and
remains the basis of Saudi Arabian dynastic rule today.[105]
In 1727, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Diriyah"] Emirate of Diriyah established in the area around Riyadh rapidly
expanded and briefly controlled most of the present-day territory of Saudi
Arabia,[106] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabi_sack_of_Karbala"] sacking Karbala in 1802, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_early_Islamic_heritage_sites_in_Saudi_Arabia"] capturing Mecca in 1803. In 1818,
 it was destroyed by the Ottoman viceroy of Egypt, Mohammed Ali 
Atlas map of Arabia and the wider
region in 1883
Pasha.[107] The much smaller [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Nejd"] Emirate of Nejd was established in 1824.
Throughout the rest of the 19th century, the Al Saud contested control of the interior of what was to become Saudi
Arabia with another Arabian ruling family, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashidi_dynasty"] Al Rashid, who ruled the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Jabal_Shammar"] Emirate of Jabal Shammar. By 1891, the Al
Rashid were victorious and the Al Saud were driven into exile in Kuwait.[85]
At the beginning of the 20th century, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire"] Ottoman Empire continued to
control or have a suzerainty over most of the peninsula. Subject to this
suzerainty, Arabia was ruled by a patchwork of tribal rulers,[108][109] with the
 Sharif of Mecca having pre-eminence and ruling the Hejaz.[110] In 1902,
 Abdul Rahman's son, Abdul Aziz—later to be known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Saud"] Ibn Saud—
recaptured control of Riyadh bringing the Al Saud back to Nejd, creating the
 third "Saudi state".[85] Ibn Saud gained the support of the Ikhwan, a tribal
army inspired by Wahhabism and led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faisal_Al-Dawish"] Faisal Al-Dawish, and which had
grown quickly after its foundation in 1912.[111] With the aid of the Ikhwan,
Ibn Saud captured Al-Ahsa from the Ottomans in 1913.
In 1916, with the encouragement and support of Britain (which was fighting
the Ottomans in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"] World War I), the Sharif of Mecca, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussein_bin_Ali,_Sharif_of_Mecca"] Hussein bin Ali, led a
 pan-Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire to create a united Arab
state.[112] Although the Arab Revolt of 1916 to 1918 failed in its objective,
 the Allied victory in World War I resulted in the end of Ottoman suzerainty
and control in Arabia and Hussein bin Ali became [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hejaz"] King of Hejaz.[113] 
 Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, the founding
father and first king of Saudi Arabia
Ibn Saud avoided involvement in the Arab Revolt, and instead continued his
struggle with the Al Rashid. Following the latter's final defeat, he took the title [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultanate_of_Nejd"] Sultan of Nejd in 1921. With the help
of the Ikhwan, the Kingdom of Hejaz was conquered in 1924–25, and on 10 January 1926, Ibn Saud declared
himself King of Hejaz.[114] For the next five years, he administered the two parts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hejaz_and_Nejd"] his dual kingdom as separate
units.[85]
After the conquest of the Hejaz, the Ikhwan leadership's objective switched to expansion of the Wahhabist realm into
the British protectorates of Transjordan, Iraq and Kuwait, and began raiding those territories. This met with Ibn
Saud's opposition, as he recognized the danger of a direct conflict with the British. At the same time, the Ikhwan
became disenchanted with Ibn Saud's domestic policies which appeared to favour modernization and the increase in
the number of non-Muslim foreigners in the country. As a result, they turned against Ibn Saud and, after a two-year
Page 8
struggle, were defeated in 1929 at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sabilla"] Battle of Sabilla, where their leaders were massacred.[115] On 23 September
1932, the two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Hejaz_and_Nejd"] kingdoms of the Hejaz and Nejd were united as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,[85] and that date is now
a national holiday called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_National_Day"] Saudi National Day.[116]
Post-unification
The new kingdom was reliant on limited agriculture and pilgrimage
revenues.[117] In 1938, vast reserves of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum"] oil were discovered in the Al-Ahsa
region along the coast of the Persian Gulf, and full-scale development of the
 oil fields began in 1941 under the US-controlled Aramco (Arabian American
Oil Company). Oil provided Saudi Arabia with economic prosperity and
substantial political leverage internationally.[85]
Cultural life rapidly developed, primarily in the Hejaz, which was the centre
 for newspapers and radio. However, the large influx of foreign workers in
Saudi Arabia in the oil industry increased the pre-existing propensity for
xenophobia.[118] At the same time, the government became increasingly
wasteful and extravagant. By the 1950s this had led to large governmental
deficits and excessive foreign borrowing.[85] 
Political map of Saudi Arabia
In 1953, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saud_of_Saudi_Arabia"] Saud of Saudi Arabia succeeded as the king of Saudi Arabia, on his
father's death, until 1964 when he was deposed in favour of his half brother
 Faisal of Saudi Arabia, after an intense rivalry, fuelled by doubts in the royal family over Saud's competence. In 1972,
Saudi Arabia gained a 20 per cent control in Aramco, thereby decreasing US control over Saudi oil.
In 1973, Saudi Arabia led an oil boycott against the Western countries that supported Israel in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War"] Yom Kippur War
 against Egypt and Syria. Oil prices quadrupled.[85] In 1975, Faisal was assassinated by his nephew, Prince Faisal bin
Musaid and was succeeded by his half-brother [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_of_Saudi_Arabia"] King Khalid.[119]
By 1976, Saudi Arabia had become the largest oil producer in the world.[120] Khalid's reign saw economic and social
development progress at an extremely rapid rate, transforming the infrastructure and educational system of the
country;[85] in foreign policy, close ties with the US were developed.[119] In 1979, two events occurred which greatly
concerned the government,[121] and had a long-term influence on Saudi foreign and domestic policy. The first was
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution"] Iranian Islamic Revolution. It was feared that the country's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shi%27a_Islam_in_Saudi_Arabia"] Shi'ite minority in the Eastern Province (which is also
the location of the oil fields) might rebel under the influence of their Iranian co-religionists. There were several anti-
government uprisings in the region such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_Qatif_Uprising"] 1979 Qatif Uprising.[122]
The second event was the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Mosque_Seizure"] Grand Mosque Seizure in Mecca by Islamist extremists. The militants involved were in
part angered by what they considered to be the corruption and un-Islamic nature of the Saudi government.[122] The
government regained control of the mosque after 10 days and those captured were executed. Part of the response of
the royal family was to enforce the much stricter observance of traditional religious and social norms in the country
(for example, the closure of cinemas) and to give the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulema"] Ulema a greater role in government.[123] Neither entirely
succeeded as Islamism continued to grow in strength.[124]
In 1980, Saudi Arabia bought out the American interests in Aramco.[125] King Khalid died of a heart attack in June
1982. He was succeeded by his brother, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahd_of_Saudi_Arabia"] King Fahd, who added the title "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques" to his
name in 1986 in response to considerable fundamentalist pressure to avoid the use of "majesty" in association with
anything except God. Fahd continued to develop close relations with the United States and increased the purchase of
American and British military equipment.[85]
The vast wealth generated by oil revenues was beginning to have an even greater impact on Saudi society. It led to
rapid technological (but not cultural) modernization, urbanization, mass public education, and the creation of new
media. This and the presence of increasingly large numbers of foreign workers greatly affected traditional Saudi
norms and values. Although there was a dramatic change in the social and economic life of the country, political
power continued to be monopolized by the royal family[85] leading to discontent among many Saudis who began to
look for wider participation in government.[126]
Page 9
In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia spent $25 billion in support of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein"] Saddam Hussein in
 the Iran–Iraq War;[127] however, Saudi Arabia condemned the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait in 1990 and asked the US to intervene.[85] King Fahd allowed
American and coalition troops to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. He invited the
Kuwaiti government and many of its citizens to stay in Saudi Arabia, but
expelled citizens of Yemen and Jordan because of their governments' support
of Iraq. In 1991, Saudi Arabian forces were involved both in bombing raids
on Iraq and in the land invasion that helped to liberate Kuwait.
Saudi Arabia's relations with the West began to cause growing concern
among some of the ulema and students of Sharia law and was one of the
issues that led to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_militant_incidents_in_Saudi_Arabia"] an increase in Islamist terrorism in Saudi Arabia, as well as
 Islamist terrorist attacks in Western countries by Saudi nationals. Osama bin

responsible for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_U.S._embassy_bombings"] 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa and the 2000
 USS Cole bombing near the port of Aden, Yemen. 15 of the 19 terrorists
involved in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks"] September 11 attacks in New York City, Washington, D.C., and
near Shanksville, Pennsylvania were Saudi nationals.[128] Many Saudis who did not support the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamist"] Islamist terrorists
were nevertheless deeply unhappy with the government's policies.[129]
Islamism was not the only source of hostility to the government. Although extremely wealthy by the 21st century,
Saudi Arabia's economy was near stagnant. High taxes and a growth in unemployment have contributed to discontent
and have been reflected in a rise in civil unrest, and discontent with the royal family. In response, a number of limited
reforms were initiated by King Fahd. In March 1992, he introduced the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law_of_Saudi_Arabia"] Basic Law", which emphasized the duties
and responsibilities of a ruler. In December 1993, the Consultative Council was inaugurated. It is composed of a
chairman and 60 members—all chosen by the King. The King's intent was to respond to dissent while making as few
actual changes in the status quo as possible. Fahd made it clear that he did not have democracy in mind, saying: "A
system based on elections is not consistent with our Islamic creed, which [approves of] government by consultation
[shūrā]."[85]
In 1995, Fahd suffered a debilitating stroke, and the Crown Prince, Abdullah, assumed the role of de facto regent,
taking on the day-to-day running of the country; however, his authority was hindered by conflict with Fahd's full
brothers (known, with Fahd, as the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudairi_Seven"] Sudairi Seven").[130] From the 1990s, signs of discontent continued and
included, in 2003 and 2004, a series of bombings and armed violence in Riyadh, Jeddah, Yanbu and Khobar.[131] In
February–April 2005, the first-ever nationwide municipal elections were held in Saudi Arabia. Women were not
allowed to take part in the poll.[85]
In 2005, King Fahd died and was succeeded by Abdullah, who continued the
policy of minimum reform and clamping down on protests. The king
introduced a number of economic reforms aimed at reducing the country's
reliance on oil revenue: limited deregulation, encouragement of foreign
investment, and privatization. In February 2009, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_of_Saudi_Arabia"] Abdullah announced a series
of governmental changes to the judiciary, armed forces, and various ministries
to modernize these institutions including the replacement of senior appointees
in the judiciary and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_religious_police"] Mutaween (religious police) with more moderate
individuals and the appointment of the country's first female deputy
minister.[85]
On 29 January 2011, hundreds of protesters gathered in the city of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah"] Jeddah in
a rare display of criticism against the city's poor infrastructure after deadly
floods swept through the city, killing 11 people.[132] Police stopped the
demonstration after about 15 minutes and arrested 30 to 50 people.[133]

Since 2011, Saudi Arabia has been affected by its own [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%9313_Saudi_Arabian_protests"] Arab Spring protests.[134] In response, King Abdullah
announced on 22 February 2011 a series of benefits for citizens amounting to $36 billion, of which $10.7 billion was
earmarked for housing.[135][136][137] No political reforms were announced as part of the package, though some
prisoners indicted for financial crimes were pardoned.[138] On 18 March the same year, King Abdullah announced a
Page 10
package of $93 billion, which included 500,000 new homes to a cost of $67 billion, in addition to creating 60,000
new security jobs.[139][140] Although male-only [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian_municipal_elections,_2011"] municipal elections were held on 29 September 2011,[141][142]
Abdullah allowed women to vote and be elected in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian_municipal_elections,_2015"] 2015 municipal elections, and also to be nominated to the
 Shura Council.[143]
Since 2001, Saudi Arabia has engaged in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Saudi_Arabia#The_Internet"] widespread internet censorship. Most online censorship generally falls into
two categories: one based on censoring "immoral" (mostly pornographic and LGBT-supportive websites along with
 websites promoting any religious ideology other than Sunni Islam) and one based on a blacklist run by Saudi Arabia's
Ministry of Media, which primarily censors websites critical of the Saudi regime or associated with parties that are
opposed to or opposed by Saudi Arabia.[144][145][146]
Politics 
Saudi Arabia is an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy"] absolute monarchy;[147] however, according to
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law_of_Saudi_Arabia"] Basic Law of Saudi Arabia adopted by royal decree in 1992,
the king must comply with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia"] Sharia (Islamic law) and the Quran,
while the Quran and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnah"] Sunnah (the traditions of Muhammad) are
declared to be the country's constitution.[148] No political parties
or national elections are permitted.[147] Saudi Arabia is
authoritarian,[149][150][151] and some critics regard it as a
 totalitarian state.[152][153][154] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist"] The Economist rated the Saudi

Minister 
In the absence of national elections and political parties,[147]
politics in Saudi Arabia takes place in two distinct arenas: within
the royal family, the Al Saud, and between the royal family and the rest of Saudi society.[157] Outside of the Al-Saud,
participation in the political process is limited to a relatively small segment of the population and takes the form of the
royal family consulting with the ulema, tribal sheikhs, and members of important commercial families on major
decisions.[158] This process is not reported by the Saudi media.[159]
By custom, all males of full age have a right to petition the king directly through the traditional tribal meeting known
as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majlis"] majlis.[160] In many ways the approach to government differs little from the traditional system of tribal rule.
Tribal identity remains strong and, outside of the royal family, political influence is frequently determined by tribal
affiliation, with tribal sheikhs maintaining a considerable degree of influence over local and national events.[158] As
mentioned earlier, in recent years there have been limited steps to widen political participation such as the
establishment of the Consultative Council in the early 1990s and the National Dialogue Forum in 2003.[161]
 The rule of the Al Saud faces political opposition from four sources: Sunni Islamist activism; liberal critics; the Shi'ite
minority—particularly in the Eastern Province; and long-standing tribal and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regionalism_(politics)"] regionalist particularistic opponents (for
example in the Hejaz).[162] Of these, the minority activists have been the most prominent threat to the government
and have in recent years perpetrated a number of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_militant_incidents_in_Saudi_Arabia"] violent incidents in the country.[131] However, open protest against
the government, even if peaceful, is not tolerated.[163]
Monarchy and royal family
The king combines legislative, executive, and judicial functions[158] and royal decrees form the basis of the country's
legislation.[164] The king is also the prime minister, and presides over the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Ministers_of_Saudi_Arabia"] Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia and
 Consultative Assembly of Saudi Arabia. The royal family dominates the political system. The family's vast numbers
allow it to control most of the kingdom's important posts and to have an involvement and presence at all levels of
government.[165] The number of princes is estimated to be at least 7,000, with most power and influence being
wielded by the 200 or so male descendants of Ibn Saud.[166] The key ministries are generally reserved for the royal
family,[147] as are the 13 regional governorships.[167]
Page 11
Long-term political and government appointments have resulted in the
creation of "power fiefdoms" for senior princes,[168] such as those of King
Abdullah, who had been Commander of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian_National_Guard"] National Guard since 1963 (until
 2010, when he appointed his son to replace him),[169] former Crown Prince

1975 to his death in 2012, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saud_bin_Faisal_bin_Abdulaziz_Al_Saud"] Prince Saud who had been Minister of Foreign

faction is known as the '[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudairi"] Sudairi Seven', comprising the late King Fahd and
his full brothers and their descendants.[173] Ideological divisions include
issues over the speed and direction of reform,[174] and whether the role of the ulema should be increased or reduced.
There were divisions within the family over who should succeed to the throne after the accession or earlier death of
Prince Sultan.[173][175] When prince Sultan died before ascending to the throne on 21 October 2011, King Abdullah
appointed Prince Nayef as crown prince.[176] The following year, Prince Nayef also died before ascending to the
throne.[177]
As many as 500 princes,
government ministers, and business

Abdullah, were arrested by Saudi
Arabian authorities as part of the

The Saudi government[178][179][180] and the royal family[181][182][183] have
often been accused of corruption over many years,[184] and this continues
into the 21st century.[185] In a country that is said to "belong" to the royal
family and is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology_of_Saudi_Arabia"] named for them,[51] the lines between state assets and the
personal wealth of senior princes are blurred.[166] The extent of corruption
has been described as systemic[186] and endemic,[187] and its existence was
acknowledged[188] and defended[189] by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_bin_Sultan"] Prince Bandar bin Sultan (a senior
member of the royal family)[190] in an interview in 2001.[191] Although
corruption allegations have often been limited to broad undocumented
accusations,[192] specific allegations were made in 2007, when it was claimed
that the British defence contractor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE_Systems"] BAE Systems had paid Prince Bandar
US$2 billion in bribes relating to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Yamamah_arms_deal"] Al-Yamamah arms deal.[193][194] Prince
Bandar denied the allegations.[195] In 2010, investigations by both US and
UK authorities resulted in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain"] plea bargain agreements with the company, by
which it paid $447 million in fines but did not admit to bribery.[196]

from 0 to 10 where 0 is "highly corrupt" and 10 is "highly clean").[197] Saudi Arabia has undergone a process of
political and social reform, such as to increase public transparency and good governance, but nepotism and patronage
are widespread when doing business in the country; the enforcement of the anti-corruption laws is selective and
public officials engage in corruption with impunity. A number of prominent Saudi Arabian princes, government
ministers, and businesspeople, including Prince [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Waleed_bin_Talal"] Al-Waleed bin Talal, were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Saudi_Arabian_anti-corruption_arrests"] arrested in Saudi Arabia in November
2017.[198]
There has been mounting pressure to reform and modernize the royal family's rule, an agenda championed by King
Abdullah both before and after his accession in 2005. The creation of the Consultative Council in the early 1990s did
not satisfy demands for political participation, and, in 2003, an annual National Dialogue Forum was announced that
would allow selected professionals and intellectuals to publicly debate current national issues, within certain
prescribed parameters. In 2005, the first municipal elections were held. In 2007, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegiance_Council"] Allegiance Council was created
to regulate the succession.[161] In 2009, the king made significant personnel changes to the government by appointing
reformers to key positions and the first woman to a ministerial post;[199][200] however, these changes have been
criticized as being too slow or merely cosmetic.[201]

Al ash-Sheikh and role of the ulema
Saudi Arabia is almost unique in giving the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulama"] ulema (the body of Islamic
religious leaders and jurists) a direct role in government.[202] The preferred
ulema are of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salafi_movement"] Salafi persuasion. The ulema have also been a key influence
 in major government decisions, for example the imposition of the oil embargo
in 1973 and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War"] invitation to foreign troops to Saudi Arabia in 1990.[203] In
addition, they have had a major role in the judicial and education systems[204]
and a monopoly of authority in the sphere of religious and social morals.[205] 
 Abdullah ibn Muhammad Al ash-
By the 1970s, as a result of oil wealth and the modernization of the country Sheikh with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogdan_Borusewicz"] Bogdan Borusewicz in
initiated by King Faisal, important changes to Saudi society were underway
and the power of the ulema was in decline.[206] However, this changed 
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Senate"] Polish Senate, 26 May 2014
following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Mosque_Seizure"] seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 by Islamist
radicals.[207] The government's response to the crisis included strengthening the ulema's powers and increasing their
financial support:[123] in particular, they were given greater control over the education system[207] and allowed to
enforce the stricter observance of Wahhabi rules of moral and social behaviour.[123] After his accession to the throne
in 2005, King Abdullah took steps to reduce the powers of the ulema, for instance transferring control over girls'
education to the Ministry of Education.[208]
The ulema have historically been led by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_ash-Sheikh"] Al ash-Sheikh,[209] the country's leading religious family.[205] The Al
ash-Sheikh are the descendants of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Abd_al-Wahhab"] Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the 18th-century founder of the Wahhabi form of
Sunni Islam which is today dominant in Saudi Arabia.[210] The family is second in prestige only to the Al Saud (the
royal family)[211] with whom they formed a "mutual support pact"[212] and power-sharing arrangement nearly 300
years ago.[203] The pact, which persists to this day,[212] is based on the Al Saud maintaining the Al ash-Sheikh's
authority in religious matters and upholding and propagating Wahhabi doctrine. In return, the Al ash-Sheikh support
the Al Saud's political authority[213] thereby using its religious-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_authority"] moral authority to legitimize the royal family's
rule.[214] Although the Al ash-Sheikh's domination of the ulema has diminished in recent decades,[215] they still hold
the most important religious posts and are closely linked to the Al Saud by a high degree of intermarriage.[205]
Legal system
The primary source of law is the Islamic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia"] Sharia derived from the teachings of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qur%27an"] Qur'an and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnah"] Sunnah (the traditions of the Prophet).[164] Saudi Arabia is
unique among modern Muslim states in that Sharia is not codified and there is
no system of judicial precedent, giving judges the power to use independent
legal reasoning to make a decision. Saudi judges tend to follow the principles
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanbali"] Hanbali school of jurisprudence ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiqh"] fiqh) found in pre-modern texts[217]
and noted for its literalist interpretation of the Qur'an and hadith.[218]
Because the judge is empowered to disregard previous judgments (either his
own or of other judges) and may apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to
any particular case, divergent judgments arise even in apparently identical
cases,[219] making predictability of legal interpretation difficult.[220] The
Sharia court system constitutes the basic judiciary of Saudi Arabia and its
judges (qadi) and lawyers form part of the ulema, the country's Islamic
scholars.[221] 
Verses from the Quran. The Quran is
the official constitution of the country
and a primary source of law. Saudi
Arabia is unique in enshrining a
religious text as a political
document.[216]
Royal decrees are the other main source of law; but are referred to as regulations rather than laws because they are
subordinate to the Sharia.[164] Royal decrees supplement Sharia in areas such as labour, commercial and corporate
law. Additionally, traditional tribal law and custom remain significant.[222] Extra-Sharia government tribunals usually
handle disputes relating to specific royal decrees.[223] Final appeal from both Sharia courts and government tribunals
is to the King and all courts and tribunals follow Sharia rules of evidence and procedure.[224]

The Saudi system of justice has been criticized for its "ultra-puritanical judges", who are often harsh in their
sentencing (with beheading for the crime of witchcraft), but also sometimes overly lenient (for cases of rape or wife-
beating) and slow, for example leaving thousands of abandoned women unable to secure a divorce.[225][226] The
system has also been criticized for being arcane,[227] lacking in some of the safeguards of justice, and unable to deal
with the modern world.[228]In 2007, King Abdullah issued royal decrees reforming the judiciary and creating a new
court system,[219] and, in 2009, the King made a number of significant changes to the judiciary's personnel at the
most senior level by bringing in a younger generation.[227] Studies have shown that Saudi Arabia has one of the
lowest crime rates in the world although there are differing views as to whether this is attributable to the legal system
or other factors such as social structures.[229]Although repeated theft can be punishable by amputation of the right
hand, only one instance of judicial amputation was reported between 2007[230] and 2010.[231][232][233] Atheism or
"calling into question the fundamentals of the Islamic religion on which this country is based" is considered a terrorist
crime.[234]Lashings are a common form of punishment[235] and are often imposed for offences against religion and
public morality such as drinking alcohol and neglect of prayer and fasting obligations.[236]
Retaliatory punishments, or Qisas, are practised: for instance, an eye can be surgically removed at the insistence of a
victim who lost his own eye.[226] Families of someone unlawfully killed can choose between demanding the death
penalty or granting clemency in return for a payment of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diyya"] diyya (blood money), by the perpetrator.[237]
Foreign relations 
Saudi Arabia joined the UN in 1945[47][238] and is a founding member of the
 Arab League, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation_Council_for_the_Arab_States_of_the_Gulf"] Gulf Cooperation Council, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_World_League"] Muslim World League, and the
 Organisation of the Islamic Conference (now the Organisation of Islamic
 Cooperation).[239] It plays a prominent role in the International Monetary
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"] Fund and the World Bank, and in 2005 joined the World Trade
 Organization.[47] Saudi Arabia supports the intended formation of the Arab
Customs Union in 2015 and an Arab [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_market"] common market[240] by 2020, as
U.S. President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"] Donald Trump and  announced at the 2009 Arab League summit.[241]

Since 1960, as a founding member of OPEC, its oil pricing policy has been
generally to stabilize the world oil market and try to moderate sharp price
movements so as to not jeopardize the Western economies.[47][242] In 1973,
Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations imposed an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_embargo"] oil embargo against the
United States, United Kingdom, Japan and other Western nations which
supported [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"] Israel in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War"] Yom Kippur War of October 1973.[243] The embargo caused an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis"] oil crisis with many short- and
long-term effects on global politics and the global economy.[244]
Between the mid-1970s and 2002, Saudi Arabia expended over $70 billion in "overseas development aid". However,
there is evidence that the vast majority was, in fact, spent on propagating and extending the influence of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism"] Wahhabism
at the expense of other forms of Islam.[245] There has been an intense debate over whether Saudi aid and Wahhabism
has fomented extremism in recipient countries.[246] The two main allegations are that, by its nature, Wahhabism
encourages intolerance and promotes terrorism.[247] Counting only the non-Muslim-majority countries, Saudi Arabia
has paid for the construction of 1359 mosques, 210 Islamic centres, 202 colleges, and 2000 schools.[248]
 Saudi Arabia and the United States are strategic allies,[249][250] and since President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama"] Barack Obama took office in
2009, the US has sold $110 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia.[251] However, the relationship between Saudi Arabia and
 the United States became strained and have witnessed major decline during the last years of the Obama
administration,[252][253][254] although Obama had authorized US forces to provide logistical and intelligence support
to the Saudis in their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen"] military intervention in Yemen, establishing a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_of_Yemen#United_States's_role"] joint coordination planning cell with the Saudi
military that is helping manage the war,[255][256] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA"] CIA used Saudi bases for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposition_Matrix"] drone assassinations in
Yemen.[257][258][259][260] In the first decade of the 21st century the Saudi Arabia paid approximately $100 million to
 American firms to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia_lobby_in_the_United_States"] lobby the U.S. government.[261] On 20 May 2017, President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"] Donald Trump and King Salman
signed a series of letters of intent for Saudi Arabia to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_United_States%E2%80%93Saudi_Arabia_arms_deal"] purchase arms from the United States totalling US$110 billion
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qisas"]
Page 14
immediately and $350 billion over 10 years.[262][263] In December 2021, the
US Senate voted against a proposal to stop a $650 million sales of advanced
medium range air-to-air missiles to Saudi Arabia to discourage it from its
military intervention in Yemen.[264][265]
In the Arab and Muslim worlds,
Saudi Arabia is considered to be pro-
Western and pro-American,[267] and
it is certainly a long-term ally of the
United States.[268] However, this[269]
and Saudi Arabia's role in the 1991
 Gulf War, particularly the stationing
of US troops on Saudi soil from
1991, prompted the development of a

 Faisal Mosque in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad"] Islamabad is
named after a Saudi king. The
kingdom is a strong ally of Pakistan.
 WikiLeaks claimed that Saudis are 
hostile Islamist response
internally.[270] As a result, Saudi Arabia has, to some extent, distanced itself
from the US and, for example, refused to support or to participate in the US-
led [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War"] invasion of Iraq in 2003.[158]
"long accustomed to having a
significant role in Pakistan's
affairs".[266] 
 China and Saudi Arabia are major allies, with relationship between the two
countries growing significantly in recent decades. A significant number of
Saudi Arabians have also expressed a positive view of China.[271][272][273]
 In February 2019, Crown Prince Mohammad defended China's Xinjiang re-
education camps for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghurs"] Uyghur Muslims,[274][275] saying "China has the right to carry out anti-terrorism and de-
extremisation work for its national security."[276][277] In July 2019, UN ambassadors of 37 countries, including Saudi
Arabia, have signed a joint letter to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHRC"] UNHRC defending China's treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minority
groups in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang"] Xinjiang region.[278]
The consequences of the 2003 invasion and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring"] Arab Spring led to increasing alarm within the Saudi monarchy over
the rise of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"] Iran's influence in the region.[279] These fears were reflected in comments of King Abdullah,[208] who
privately urged the United States to attack Iran and "cut off the head of the snake".[280] The tentative rapprochement
between the US and Iran that began in secret in 2011[281] was said to be feared by the Saudis,[282] and, during the
run up to the widely welcomed deal on Iran's nuclear programme that capped the first stage of US–Iranian détente,
Robert Jordan, who was US ambassador to Riyadh from 2001 to 2003, said "[t]he Saudis' worst nightmare would be
the [Obama] administration striking a grand bargain with Iran."[283] A trip to Saudi by US President Barack Obama
in 2014 included discussions of US–Iran relations, though these failed to resolve Riyadh's concerns.[284]
In order to protect the house of Khalifa, the monarchs of Bahrain, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi-led_intervention_in_Bahrain"] Saudi Arabia invaded Bahrain by sending military
troops to quell the uprising of Bahraini people on 14 March 2011.[285] The Saudi government considered the two-
month uprising as a "security threat" posed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam"] Shia who represent the majority of Bahrain population.[285]
On 25 March 2015, Saudi Arabia, spearheading a coalition of Sunni Muslim
states,[286] started a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabian-led_intervention_in_Yemen"] military intervention in Yemen against the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam"] Shia [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthis"] Houthis
and forces loyal to former President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Abdullah_Saleh"] Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was deposed in
the 2011 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring"] Arab Spring uprisings.[287] At least 56,000 people have been killed
in armed violence in Yemen between January 2016 and October 2018.[288]
 Saudi Arabia, together with Qatar and Turkey, openly supported the Army of
Conquest,[289][290] an umbrella group of anti-government forces fighting in
 the Syrian Civil War that reportedly included an al-Qaeda linked al-Nusra
Front and another [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salafi_jihadism"] Salafi coalition known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahrar_al-Sham"] Ahrar al-Sham.[291] Saudi
Arabia was also involved in the CIA-led [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_Sycamore"] Timber Sycamore covert operation
to train and arm [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_armed_groups_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War"] Syrian rebels.[292]

In March 2015, Sweden scrapped an arms deal with Saudi Arabia, marking an end to a decade-old defence
agreement with the kingdom. The decision came after Swedish Foreign Minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_Wallstr%C3%B6m"] Margot Wallstrom was blocked by
the Saudis while speaking about democracy and women's rights at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League"] Arab League in Cairo. This also led to Saudi
Arabia recalling its ambassador to Sweden.[296]
Saudi Arabia has been seen as a moderating influence in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_conflict"] Arab–Israeli conflict, periodically putting forward a
peace plan between Israel and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_people"] Palestinians and condemning Hezbollah.[297] Following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring"] Arab Spring Saudi
Arabia offered asylum to deposed President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine_El_Abidine_Ben_Ali"] Zine El Abidine Ben Ali of Tunisia and King Abdullah telephoned
President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosni_Mubarak"] Hosni Mubarak of Egypt (prior to his deposition) to offer his support.[298] In early 2014 relations with
 Qatar became strained over its support for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_Brotherhood"] Muslim Brotherhood, and Saudi Arabia's belief that Qatar was
interfering in its affairs. In August 2014 both countries appeared to be exploring ways of ending the rift.[299] Saudi
Arabia and its allies have criticized Qatar-based TV channel [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera"] Al Jazeera and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Qatar_relations"] Qatar's relations with Iran. In 2017,
Saudi Arabia imposed a land, naval and air [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017%E2%80%9318_Qatar_diplomatic_crisis"] blockade on Qatar.[300]
Saudi Arabia halted new trade and investment dealings with Canada and
 suspended diplomatic ties in a dramatic escalation of a dispute over the
kingdom's arrest of women's rights activist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samar_Badawi"] Samar Badawi on 6 August
2018.[301][302]
Tensions have escalated between Saudi Arabia and its allies after the
disappearance of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Khashoggi"] Jamal Khashoggi from the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
Turkish officials are highly sceptical of Khashoggi being murdered inside the
 consulate; this has strained the already suffering Saudi Arabia–Turkey
relations. As stated by Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, director of the German Marshall
Fund's Ankara office "Turkey is maintaining a very delicate balance in its
relations with Saudi Arabia. The relations have the potential of evolving into
a crisis at any moment."[303] 
 Major Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy
conflict locations
The pressure on Saudi to reveal the insights about [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Jamal_Khashoggi"] Khashoggi's disappearance from the US and other European
countries has increased. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia%E2%80%93United_States_relations"] Saudi-US relations took an ugly turn on 14 October 2018, when Trump promised "severe
punishment" if the royal court was responsible for Khashoggis' death. The Saudi Foreign Ministry retaliated with an
equal statement saying, "it will respond with greater action," indicating the kingdom's "influential and vital role in the
global economy." A joint statement was issued by Britain, France, and Germany also demanding a "credible
investigation to establish the truth about what happened, and — if relevant — to identify those bearing responsibility
for the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, and ensure that they are held to account."[304]
The US expects its Gulf allies involved in the coalition in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen"] Yemen to put in more efforts and address the rising
concerns about the millions that have been pushed to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine_in_Yemen_(2016%E2%80%93present)"] brink of famine. According to the United Nations, the
Arabian peninsula nation is home to the world's worst humanitarian crisis.[305] More than 50,000 children in Yemen
died from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation"] starvation in 2017.[306] The famine in Yemen is the direct result of the Saudi-led intervention and blockade
of the rebel-held area.[307][308]
In the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's murder in October 2018, the US secretary of state [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pompeo"] Mike Pompeo and the US
defence secretary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Mattis"] Jim Mattis called for a ceasefire in Yemen within 30 days followed by UN-initiated peace talks.
Pompeo has asked Saudi Arabia and the UAE to stop their airstrikes on populated areas in Yemen. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_May"] Theresa May
backed the US call to end the coalition. President of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Rescue_Committee"] International Rescue Committee [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Miliband"] David Miliband called the
US announcement as "the most significant breakthrough in the war in Yemen for four years".[309]
In September 2020, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showtime_(TV_network)"] Showtime announced that it will premiere its original documentary, Kingdom of Silence, on 2
October that year. The film was based on the 2018 murder of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Khashoggi"] Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi authorities. Directed by
filmmaker Rick Rowley, the documentary examines the relationship between the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"] US and Saudi Arabia, as a backdrop

to the murder of Khashoggi, along with the interactions between the Trump administration and Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman.[310] Another documentary by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Fogel"] Bryan Fogel, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dissident"] The Dissident, which excavated a web of deceit
behind the murder, was to be released on the same day that marked the second death anniversary of Khashoggi.[311]
 Jeremy Hunt, the UK Foreign Secretary, on his visit to Saudi Arabia and the UAE on 12 November 2018, is
expected to raise the need for a ceasefire from all sides in the four-year-long Yemen civil war. The US called for a
 ceasefire within 30 days.[312] Andrew Smith, of Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), said that Hunt and Boris
Johnson "played an utterly central and complicit role in arming and supporting the Saudi-led destruction of
Yemen."[313][314]
In 2017, as part of its nuclear power program, Saudi Arabia planned to extract uranium domestically, taking a step
towards self-sufficiency in producing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fuel"] nuclear fuel. On 24 August 2017, the Kingdom signed a memorandum of
understanding with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Nuclear_Corporation"] China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) to explore and assess uranium[315] On 4 August
2020, a report claimed that Saudi Arabia has constructed a facility in the desert near Al-'Ula for extracting uranium
yellowcake from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_ore"] uranium ore with the help of China. The facility raised concerns among the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"] US and allied officials
about Saudi nuclear energy plans and the country's option of developing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"] nuclear weapon.[316] On 19 August 2020,
Congressional Democrats asked the US secretary of state, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pompeo"] Mike Pompeo, to provide information about China's
alleged role in building a uranium processing facility in Saudi Arabia.[317]
On 17 September 2020, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian"] The Guardian released an exclusive report revealing that Saudi Arabia was paving the way
for domestic production of nuclear fuel. The confidential report obtained by the media house stated that the Kingdom
was assisted by Chinese geologists to produce over 90,000 tonnes of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium"] uranium from three major deposits in the centre
and northwest of Saudi, near the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEOM"] NEOM megacity development. The disclosure raised concerns regarding Riyadh's
aggressive interest in developing atomic weapons program.[318] Apart from China, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN"] UN nuclear watchdog,
 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was also assisting Saudi's nuclear ambition.[319]
Allegations of sponsoring global terrorism
According to the Iraqi prime minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouri_al-Maliki"] Nouri al-Maliki in March 2014, Saudi
Arabia along with Qatar provided political, financial, and media support to
terrorists against the Iraqi government.[320] Similarly, President of Syria
 Bashar al-Assad noted that the sources of the extreme ideology of the terrorist
organization [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant"] ISIS and other such [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salafi_jihadism"] salafist extremist groups are the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahabbism"] Wahabbism
that has been supported by the royal family of Saudi Arabia.[321]
Relations with the U.S. became strained following [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks"] 9/11 terror attacks.[322]
American politicians and media accused the Saudi government of supporting
terrorism and tolerating a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadist"] jihadist culture.[323] Indeed, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden"] Osama bin Laden and
15 out of the 19 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia;[324] in ISIL-

Department of State memo, dated 17 August 2014, says that "governments of
Qatar and Saudi Arabia...are providing clandestine financial and logistic
 support to ISIS and other radical groups in the region."[254] According to former US Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, "Saudi Arabia remains a critical financial support base for al-Qaida, the Taliban, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeT"] LeT and other terrorist
groups...  Donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups
worldwide."[326] Former CIA director [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Woolsey"] James Woolsey described it as "the soil in which [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda"] Al-Qaeda and its sister
terrorist organizations are flourishing."[327] The Saudi government denies these claims or that it exports religious or
cultural extremism.[328] In April 2016, Saudi Arabia has threatened to sell off $750 billion in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security"] Treasury securities and
other US assets if [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress"] Congress passes a bill that would allow the Saudi government to be sued over 9/11.[249] In
September 2016, the Congress passed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Against_Sponsors_of_Terrorism_Act"] Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act that would allow relatives of
victims of the 11 September attacks to sue Saudi Arabia for its government's alleged role in the attacks.[329] Congress
overwhelmingly rejected President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_presidential_vetoes"] Barack Obama's veto.[253][254]
According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Patey"] Sir William Patey, former British ambassador to Saudi Arabia, the kingdom funds mosques throughout
Europe that have become hotbeds of extremism. "They are not funding terrorism. They are funding something else,
which may down the road lead to individuals being radicalised and becoming fodder for terrorism," Patey said. He
Page 17
said that Saudi has been funding an ideology that leads to extremism and the leaders of the kingdom are not aware of
the consequences.[330]
However, since 2016 the kingdom began backing away from Islamist ideologies.[331] Several reforms took place
including curbing the powers of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_the_Promotion_of_Virtue_and_the_Prevention_of_Vice_(Saudi_Arabia)"] religious police,[332] stopping funding mosques in foreign countries,[333] and first

return to “moderate Islam”.[335]
Military 
 The Saudi military consists of the Royal Saudi Land Forces, the Royal Saudi
 Air Force, the Royal Saudi Navy, the Royal Saudi Air Defense, the Saudi
Arabian National Guard (SANG, an independent military force),  and
paramilitary forces, totalling nearly 200,000 active-duty personnel. In 2005
the armed forces had the following personnel: the army, 75,000; the air force,
"The Saudi pilots training in Italy
1935"—a scene from 'Our Eagles', 
18,000; air defence, 16,000; the navy, 15,500 (including 3,000 marines); and
the SANG had 75,000 active soldiers and 25,000 tribal levies.[336] In
addition, there is an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Mukhabarat_Al_A%27amah"] Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah military intelligence service.

The kingdom has a long-standing military relationship with Pakistan, it has
 long been speculated that Saudi Arabia secretly funded Pakistan's atomic
bomb programme and seeks to purchase atomic weapons from Pakistan, in
near future.[337][338] The SANG is not a reserve but a fully operational front-
line force, and originated out of Ibn Saud's tribal military-religious force, the Ikhwan. Its modern existence, however,
is attributable to it being effectively [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_of_Saudi_Arabia"] Abdullah's private army since the 1960s and, unlike the rest of the armed forces,
is independent of the Ministry of Defense and Aviation. The SANG has been a counterbalance to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudairi"] Sudairi faction
in the royal family: The late prince Sultan, former Minister of Defense and Aviation, was one of the so-called 'Sudairi
Seven' and controlled the remainder of the armed forces until his death in 2011.[339]
Spending on defence and security has increased significantly since the mid-
1990s and was about US$78.4 billion, as of 2019.[31] Saudi Arabia has one
of the highest percentages of military expenditure in the world, spending
around 8% of its GDP in its military, according to the 2020 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_International_Peace_Research_Institute"] SIPRI
estimate.[340] Its modern high-technology arsenal makes Saudi Arabia among
the world's most densely armed nations, with its military equipment being
supplied primarily by the US, France, and Britain.[336]
The United States sold more than $80 billion in military hardware between
1951 and 2006 to the Saudi military.[341] On 20 October 2010, the US State
Department notified Congress of its intention to make the biggest arms sale in 
Saudi soldiers from the First Airborne
Brigade.
American history—an estimated $60.5 billion purchase by the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia. The package represents a considerable improvement in the offensive capability of the Saudi armed
forces.[342] 2013 saw Saudi military spending climb to $67bn, overtaking that of the UK, France and Japan to place
fourth globally.[343]
The United Kingdom has also been a major supplier of military equipment to Saudi Arabia since 1965.[344] Since
1985, the UK has supplied military aircraft—notably the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panavia_Tornado"] Tornado and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurofighter_Typhoon"] Eurofighter Typhoon combat aircraft—and
other equipment as part of the long-term [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Yamamah_arms_deal"] Al-Yamamah arms deal estimated to have been worth £43 billion by 2006
and thought to be worth a further £40 billion.[345] In May 2012, British defence giant BAE signed a £1.9bn ($3bn)
deal to supply Hawk trainer jets to Saudi Arabia.[346]
According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_International_Peace_Research_Institute"] Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, in 2010–14 Saudi Arabia became the
world's second-largest arms importer, receiving four times more major arms than in 2005–2009. Major imports in
2010–14 included 45 combat aircraft from the UK, 38 combat helicopters from the US, four tanker aircraft from
Spain, and over 600 armoured vehicles from Canada. Saudi Arabia has a long list of outstanding orders for arms,
including 27 more combat aircraft from the UK, 154 combat aircraft from the US, and a large number of armoured
Page 18
vehicles from Canada.[347] Saudi Arabia received 41 per cent of UK arms exports in 2010–14.[348] France
authorized $18 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia in 2015 alone.[251] The $15 billion arms deal with Saudi
Arabia is believed to be the largest arms sale in Canadian history.[349] In 2016, the European Parliament decided to
temporarily impose an arms embargo against Saudi Arabia, as a result of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen"] Yemen civilian population's suffering
 from the conflict with Saudi Arabia.[350] In 2017, Saudi Arabia signed a 110 billion dollar arms deal with the United
States.
Saudi Arabia is Britain's largest arms customer, with more than £4.6 billion worth of arms bought since the start of
Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. A recent poll conducted by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov"] YouGov for Save the Children and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avaaz"] Avaaz stated that 63 per
cent of British people oppose the sale of weapons to Saudi.[351]
Following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Jamal_Khashoggi"] killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a nonbinding resolution was passed in the European Parliament on 25
October 2018, urging EU countries to impose an EU-wide arms embargo on Saudi Arabia.[352] Germany became the
first Western government to suspend future arms deal with the kingdom after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel"] Angela Merkel stated that "arms exports
can't take place in the current circumstances."[353]
According to the new report from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Affairs_Canada"] Department of Global Affairs, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"] Canada sold record-breaking amount of military
hardware to Saudi Arabia in 2019, despite its poor human rights record.[354]
Human rights
The Saudi government, which mandates Muslim and non-Muslim observance of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia"] Sharia law under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_monarchy"] absolute rule of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Saud"] House of Saud, have been accused of and denounced by various international organizations and governments for
violating human rights within the country.[355] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarian"] totalitarian regime ruling the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is
consistently ranked among the "worstest" in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_House"] Freedom House's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_in_the_World"] annual survey of political and civil rights.[356]
According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International"] Amnesty International, security forces continued to torture and ill- treat detainees to extract confessions
to be used as evidence against them at trial.[357] Saudi Arabia abstained from the United Nations vote adopting the
 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, saying it contradicted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia_law"] sharia law.[358] Mass execution such as those carried
out [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Saudi_Arabia_mass_execution"] in 2016 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Saudi_Arabia_mass_execution"] in 2019 have been condemned by international rights groups.[359]
Saudi Arabian law does not recognize sexual orientations, religious freedom,
with the public practice of non-Muslim religions is actively prohibited,[362]
and regularly engages in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"] capital punishment, including public executions by
beheading.[363] The death penalty can be imposed for a wide range of
offenses,[364] including murder, rape, armed robbery, repeated drug use,
apostasy,[365] adultery,[236] witchcraft and sorcery[366] and can be carried out
by beheading with a sword,[365] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoning"] stoning or firing squad,[236] followed by
crucifixion.[366] In April 2020, Saudi Supreme Court issued a directive to
eliminate the punishment of flogging from the Saudi court system, and it is to  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deera_Square"] Deera Square, central Riyadh. It is a

headings.[360][361]
Saudi women face [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination"] discrimination in many aspects of their lives, such as the
 justice system, and under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wali_(Islamic_legal_guardian)"] male guardianship system are effectively treated
as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)"] legal minors.[369] Although they make up 70% of those enrolled in universities, for social reasons, women make
up 5% of the workforce in Saudi Arabia,[370] the lowest proportion in the world.The treatment of women has been
referred to as "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_segregation"] sex segregation",[371][372]"gender apartheid".[373][374]
Saudi Arabia is a notable destination country for men and women trafficked for the purposes of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery"] slave labour and
commercial sexual exploitation. Men and women from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"] Central Asia, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East"] Middle East, and Africa, and many other
countries voluntarily travel to Saudi Arabia as domestic servants or other low-skilled labourers, but some
subsequently face conditions indicative of involuntary servitude.[375]
Geography
Page 19
Saudi Arabia occupies about 80 per cent of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula"] Arabian Peninsula
(the world's largest peninsula),[378] lying between latitudes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_parallel_north"] 16°

southern borders with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates"] United Arab Emirates and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman"] Oman are not
precisely marked, the exact size of the country is undefined.[378]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Statistics_Division"] United Nations Statistics Division estimates 2,149,690 km2
(830,000 sq mi) and lists Saudi Arabia as the world's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area"] 12th largest
state. It is geographically the largest country in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East"] Middle East
and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Plate"] Arabian Plate.[379]
 Saudi Arabia's diverse geography is dominated by the Arabian
Desert, associated semi-desert, shrubland, steppes, several
mountain ranges, volcanic lava fields and highlands. The

contiguous sand desert.[158][380] Though there are lakes in the
country, Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the world by area
with no permanent rivers. Wadis, non-permanent rivers, however, are very
numerous. The fertile areas are to be found in the alluvial deposits in wadis,
basins, and oases.[158] The main topographical feature is the central plateau
which rises abruptly from the Red Sea and gradually descends into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nejd"] Nejd
and toward the Persian Gulf. On the Red Sea coast, there is a narrow coastal
plain, known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tihamah"] Tihamah parallel to which runs an imposing escarpment.

 Except for the southwestern regions such as Asir, Saudi Arabia has a desert
climate with very high day-time temperatures during the summer and a sharp
temperature drop at night. Average summer temperatures are around 45 °C
(113 °F), but can be as high as 54 °C (129 °F) at its most extreme. In the
winter the temperature rarely drops below 0 °C (32 °F) with the exception of
mostly the northern regions of the country where annual snowfall, in
particular in the mountainous regions of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabuk_province"] Tabuk province, is not uncommon.[381] The lowest recorded temperature to
date, −12.0 °C (10.4 °F), was measured in Turaif.[382]
In the spring and autumn the heat is temperate, temperatures average around 29 °C (84 °F). Annual rainfall is very
low. The Southern regions differ in that they are influenced by the Indian Ocean monsoons, usually occurring
between October and March. An average of 300 mm (12 in) of rainfall occurs during this period, which is about 60
per cent of the annual precipitation.[383] Saudi Arabia is home to approximately 1300 islands.[384]
Biodiversity
 Saudi Arabia is home to five terrestrial ecoregions: Arabian Peninsula coastal fog desert, Southwestern Arabian
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea_Nubo-Sindian_tropical_desert_and_semi-desert"] foothills savanna, Southwestern Arabian montane woodlands, Arabian Desert, and Red Sea Nubo-Sindian tropical
desert and semi-desert.[385]Wildlife includes the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_leopard"] Arabian leopard,[386][387] wolf, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striped_hyena"] striped hyena, mongoose, baboon,
hare, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_cat"] sand cat, and jerboa. Animals such as gazelles, oryx, leopards and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_cheetah"] cheetahs[388] were relatively numerous until
 the 19th century, when extensive hunting reduced these animals almost to extinction. The culturally important Asiatic
lion occurred in Saudi Arabia until the late 19th century before it was hunted to extinction in the wild.[389] Birds
include falcons (which are caught and trained for hunting), eagles, hawks, vultures, sandgrouse, and bulbuls. There
are several species of snakes, many of which are venomous. Saudi Arabia is home to a rich marine life. The Red Sea
Page 20
in particular is a rich and diverse ecosystem. More than [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_of_the_Red_Sea"] 1200 species of fish[390]
have been recorded in the Red Sea, and around 10 per cent of these are found
nowhere else.[391] This also includes 42 species of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deep_water_fish_of_the_Red_Sea"] deepwater fish.[390]
The rich diversity is in part due to the 2,000 km (1,240 mi) of coral reef
extending along its coastline; these [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fringing_reef"] fringing reefs are 5000–7000 years old and
are largely formed of stony [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropora"] acropora and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porites"] porites corals. The reefs form platforms
and sometimes lagoons along the coast and occasional other features such as
cylinders (such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Hole_(Red_Sea)"] Blue Hole (Red Sea) at Dahab). These coastal reefs are
 also visited by pelagic species of Red Sea fish, including some of the 44 species
of shark.The Red Sea also contains many offshore reefs including several true
atolls. Many of the unusual offshore reef formations defy classic (i.e.,
Darwinian) coral reef classification schemes, and are generally attributed to the
high levels of tectonic activity that characterize the area.Domesticated animals
include the legendary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_horse"] Arabian horse, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_camel"] Arabian camel, sheep, goats, cows,
donkeys, chickens, etc. Reflecting the country's dominant desert conditions,

little water. The date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) is widespread.[158]

Economy
As of October 2018, Saudi Arabia is the largest economy in the Middle East and the 18th largest in the world.[13]
 Saudi Arabia has the world's second-largest proven petroleum reserves and the country is the largest exporter of
 petroleum.[393][394] It also has the fifth-largest proven natural gas reserves. Saudi Arabia is considered an "energy
superpower".[395][396] It has the second highest total estimated value of natural resources, valued at US$34.4 trillion
in 2016.[397]Saudi Arabia's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_economy"] command economy is petroleum-based; roughly 63%[398] of budget revenues and
67%[399] of export earnings come from the oil industry. It is strongly dependent on foreign workers with about 80%
of those employed in the private sector being non-Saudi.[400][401]Challenges to the Saudi economy include halting
Page 21
or reversing the decline in per-capita income, improving education to
prepare youth for the workforce and providing them with employment,
diversifying the economy, stimulating the private sector and housing
construction, and diminishing corruption and inequality.[402]
The oil industry constitutes about 45% of Saudi Arabia's nominal gross
domestic product, compared with 40% from the private sector (see
below).  Saudi Arabia officially has about 260 billion barrels
(4.1×1010 m3) of oil reserves, comprising about one-fifth of the
world's proven total petroleum reserves.[403] 
A proportional representation of Saudi
In the 1990s, Saudi Arabia experienced a significant contraction of oil Arabia exports, 2019
revenues combined with a high rate of population growth. Per capita
income fell from a high of $11,700 at the height of the oil boom in
1981 to $6,300 in 1998.[404] Taking into account the impact of the real oil price changes on the Kingdom's real gross
domestic income, the real command-basis GDP was computed to be 330.381 billion 1999 USD in 2010.[405]
 Increases in oil prices in the early 2000s helped boost per capita GDP to $17,000 in 2007 dollars (about $7,400
adjusted for inflation),[406] but have declined since oil price drop in mid-2014.[407]
 OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) limits its
members' oil production based on their "proven reserves." Saudi Arabia's
published reserves have shown little change since 1980, with the main
exception being an increase of about 100 billion barrels (1.6×1010 m3)
between 1987 and 1988.[408] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Simmons"] Matthew Simmons has suggested that Saudi
Arabia is greatly exaggerating its reserves and may soon show production
declines (see [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil"] peak oil).[409]

From 2003 to 2013, "several key services" were privatized—municipal water
supply, electricity, telecommunications—and parts of education and health
care, traffic control and car accident reporting were also privatized.
According to Arab News columnist Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg, "in almost
every one of these areas, consumers have raised serious concerns about the
performance of these privatized entities."[410] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadawul"] Tadawul All Share Index (TASI) of the Saudi stock exchange
peaked at 16,712.64 in 2005, and closed at 8,535.60, at the end of 2013.[411] In November 2005, Saudi Arabia was
approved as a member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"] World Trade Organization. Negotiations to join had focused on the degree to which
 Saudi Arabia is willing to increase market access to foreign goods and in 2000, the government established the Saudi
Arabian General Investment Authority to encourage foreign direct investment in the kingdom. Saudi Arabia
maintains a list of sectors in which foreign investment is prohibited, but the government plans to open some closed
sectors such as telecommunications, insurance, and power transmission/distribution over time. The government has
also made an attempt at "Saudizing" the economy, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals with limited
success.[412]
In addition to petroleum and gas, Saudi also has a significant gold mining sector in the ancient [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahd_adh_Dhahab"] Mahd adh Dhahab
region and significant other mineral industries, an agricultural sector (especially in the southwest but not only) based
on vegetables, fruits, dates etc. and livestock, and large number of temporary jobs created by the roughly two million
annual [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj"] hajj pilgrims.[402]Saudi Arabia has had five-year "Development Plans" since 1970. Among its plans were to
launch "economic cities" (e.g. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Abdullah_Economic_City"] King Abdullah Economic City) to be completed by 2020, in an effort to diversify the
economy and provide jobs. As of 2013 four cities were planned.[414] The King has announced that the per capita
income is forecast to rise from $15,000 in 2006 to $33,500 in 2020.[415] The cities will be spread around Saudi
Arabia to promote diversification for each region and their economy, and the cities are projected to contribute $150
billion to the GDP.
Saudi Arabia is increasingly activating its ports in order to participate in trade between Europe and China in addition
to oil transport. To this end, ports such as Jeddah Islamic Port or King Abdullah Economic City are being rapidly
expanded and investments are being made in logistics. The country is historically and currently part of the Maritime
Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to the south via the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there through
Page 22
the Red Sea via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic
 region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central
Europe, Eastern Europe and the North Sea.[416][417][418][419]
Statistics on poverty in the kingdom are not available through the UN resources
because the Saudi government does not issue any.[420] The Saudi state
discourages calling attention to or complaining about poverty. In December
2011, the Saudi interior ministry arrested three reporters and held them for almost
two weeks for questioning after they uploaded a video on the topic to
YouTube.[421][422][423] Authors of the video claim that 22 per cent of Saudis
may be considered poor (2009).[424] Observers researching the issue prefer to
stay anonymous[425] because of the risk of being arrested.
In September 2018, the Public Investment Fund completed a deal with a group
of global lenders for a loan of $11 billion.[426] The deal raised more than initially
planned and was the first time the PIF had incorporated loans and debt
instruments into its funding.[427] According to data from Fitch Ratings, over two
years starting from May 2016 Saudi Arabia went from having zero debt to
raising $68 billion in dollar-denominated bonds and syndicated loans—one of
the fastest rates among emerging economies.[428] 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj"] hajj is an annual [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"] Islamic
 pilgrimage to Mecca, the holiest
city for Muslims.[413]
Each year, about a quarter-million young Saudis enter the job market. With
the first phase of Saudization into effect, 70% of sales jobs are expected to be
filled by Saudis. However, the private sector still remains hugely dominated
by foreigners. The rate of local unemployment is 12.9%, its highest in more
than a decade.[427] According to a report published by Bloomberg
Economics in 2018, the government needs to produce 700,000 jobs by 2020
to meet its 9% unemployment target.[427]
The unexpected impact of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic"] COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, along with
Saudi Arabia's poor human rights records, laid unforeseen challenges before
the development plans of the Kingdom, where some of the programs under
 'Vision 2030' were also expected to be affected.[429] On 2 May, the Finance 
King Abdullah Financial Center is
one of the largest investment centres
in the Middle East, located in Riyadh
Minister of Saudi Arabia admitted that the country's economy was facing a
severe economical crisis for the first time in decades, due to the pandemic as well as declining global oil markets.
 Mohammed Al-Jadaan said that the country will take "painful" measures and keep all options open to deal with the
impact.[430]
Agriculture
Serious large-scale agricultural development began in the 1970s. The
government launched an extensive program to promote modern farming
technology; to establish rural roads, irrigation networks and storage and
export facilities; and to encourage agricultural research and training
institutions.As a result, there has been a phenomenal growth in the
production of all basic foods. Saudi Arabia is now completely self-sufficient
in a number of foodstuffs, including meat, milk, and eggs.The country
exports wheat, dates, dairy products, eggs, fish, poultry, fruits, vegetables,
and flowers to markets around the world. Dates, once a staple of the Saudi
diet, are now mainly grown for global humanitarian aid.In addition, Saudi
farmers grow substantial amounts of other grains such as barley, sorghum,
and millet. As of 2016, in the interest of preserving precious water resources,
domestic production of wheat has ended.[431] 
 Al-Hasa is known for its palm trees
and dates. Al-Hasa has over 30
million palm trees which produce
over 100 thousand tons of dates
every year.
Page 23
The Kingdom likewise has some of the most modern and largest dairy farms in the Middle East. Milk production
boasts a remarkably productive annual rate of 6,800 litres (1,800 US gallons) per cow, one of the highest in the
world. The local dairy manufacturing company [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almarai"] Almarai is the largest vertically integrated dairy company in the
Middle East.[432]
The Kingdom's most dramatic agricultural accomplishment, noted worldwide, was its rapid transformation from
importer to exporter of wheat. In 1978, the country built its first grain silos. By 1984, it had become self-sufficient in
wheat. Shortly thereafter, Saudi Arabia began exporting wheat to some 30 countries, including China and the former
Soviet Union, and in the major producing areas of Tabuk, Hail, and Qasim, average yields reached 8.1 tonnes per
hectare (3.6 short ton/acre).The Kingdom has, however, stepped up fruit and vegetable production, by improving
both agricultural techniques and the roads that link farmers with urban consumers. Saudi Arabia is a major exporter of
fruits and vegetables to its neighbours. Among its most productive crops are watermelon, grapes, citrus fruits, onions,
squash, and tomatoes. At Jizan in the country's well-watered southwest, the Al-Hikmah Research Station is
producing tropical fruits including pineapples, paw-paws, bananas, mangoes, and guavas.[433]
The olive tree is indigenous to Saudi Arabia. In 2018, the Al Jouf Agricultural Development Company received a
certificate of merit from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guinness_World_Records"] The Guinness World Records for the largest modern olive plantation in the world. The farm
covers 7730 hectares and has 5 million olive trees. Also, the Guinness World Records took their production capacity
of 15000 tonnes of high-quality olive oil into consideration, while the kingdom consumes double that.The Al Jouf
farms are located in Sakaka, a city in the north-western part of Saudi Arabia, which is a deeply-rooted in history.
Sakaka dates back more than 4,000 years.[434] The Al Jouf region has millions of olive trees and the expected
number is expected to go up to 20 million trees soon.[435] Consuming non-renewable groundwater resulted in the loss
of an estimated four-fifths of the total groundwater reserves by 2012.[436]
Water supply and sanitation
 Water supply and sanitation in Saudi Arabia is characterized by challenges and achievements. One of the main
challenges is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity"] water scarcity. In order to overcome water scarcity, substantial investments have been undertaken in
 seawater desalination, water distribution, sewerage and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater_treatment"] wastewater treatment. Today about 50% of drinking water
comes from desalination, 40% from the mining of non-renewable groundwater and only 10% from surface water in
the mountainous southwest of the country.[437] Saudi Arabia is suffering from a major depletion of the water in its
underground aquifers and a resultant break down and disintegration of its agriculture as a consequence.[438][439] As a
result of the catastrophe, Saudi Arabia has bought agricultural land in the United States,[440][441] Argentina,[442] and
Africa.[443][444][445][446] Saudi Arabia ranked as a major buyer of agricultural land in foreign countries.[447][448]
According to the Joint Monitoring Program (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO"] WHO and UNICEF, the
latest reliable source on access to water and sanitation in Saudi Arabia is the 2004 census. It indicates that 97% of the
population had access to an improved source of drinking water and 99% had access to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improved_sanitation"] improved sanitation. For 2015,
the JMP estimates that access to sanitation increased to 100%. Sanitation was primarily through on-site solutions and
only about 40% of the population was connected to sewers.[449] In 2015, still 886 thousand people lacked access to
"improved" water.[450][451]
Tourism
Although most tourism in Saudi Arabia still largely involves religious pilgrimages, there is growth in the leisure
tourism sector. According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank"] World Bank, approximately 14.3 million people visited Saudi Arabia in 2012,
making it the world's 19th-most-visited country.[452] Tourism is an important component of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Vision_2030"] Saudi Vision 2030
and according to a report conducted by BMI Research in 2018, both religious and non-religious tourism have
significant potential for expansion.[453]
Starting December 2018, the kingdom offers an electronic visa for foreign visitors to attend sports events and
concerts. The "sharek" visa process started on 15 December 2018 when the Saudi Ad Diriyah E Prix race
started.[454] In September 2019, the Kingdom announced its plans to open visa applications for visitors, where people
from about 50 countries would be able to get tourist visas to Saudi.[455] In January 2020, it was announced that
holders of a US, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"] UK or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area"] Schengen visa are eligible for a Saudi electronic visa upon arrival.[456]

Demographics
The population of Saudi Arabia as of July 2013 is estimated to be 26.9
million, including between 5.5 million[5] and 10 million non-nationalized
immigrants,[401][457] though the Saudi population has long proved difficult to
accurately estimate due to Saudi leaders' historical tendency to inflate census
results.[458] Saudi population has grown rapidly since 1950 when it was
estimated to be 3 million,[459] and for many years had one of the highest
population growth rates in the world at around 3 per cent a year.[460]
 The ethnic composition of Saudi citizens is 90% Arab and 10% Afro-
Arab.[461] Most Saudis live in the Hejaz (35%), Najd (28%), and the Eastern
Province (15%).[462] Hejaz is the most populated region in Saudi Arabia.[463]
As late as 1970, most Saudis lived a subsistence life in the rural provinces,
but in the last half of the 20th century, the kingdom has urbanized rapidly. As
of 2012 about 80% of Saudis live in urban metropolitan areas—specifically
Riyadh, Jeddah, or Dammam.[464][465] 
Saudi Arabia population density
(people per km2)
Its population is also quite young with over half the population under 25 years old.[466] A large fraction are foreign
nationals. (The CIA Factbook estimated that as of 2013 foreign nationals living in Saudi Arabia made up about 21%
of the population.[5] Other estimates are 30%[467] or 33%[468]) Immigrants make up 38.3% of the total population,
according to UN data (2019), mostly coming from the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.[469] As recently as the early
1960s, Saudi Arabia's slave population was estimated at 300,000.[470] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_slavery_in_the_Muslim_world"] Slavery was officially abolished in
1962.[471][472]

Languages
The official language of Saudi Arabia is Arabic. The three main regional variants spoken by Saudis are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Najdi_Arabic"] Najdi Arabic
(about 14.6 million speakers[483]), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejazi_Arabic"] Hejazi Arabic (about 10.3 million speakers[484]), and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Arabic"] Gulf Arabic (about 0.96
million speakers[485]). [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faifi_language"] Faifi is spoken by about 50,000. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Sign_Language"] Saudi Sign Language is the principal language of the deaf
community, amounting to around 100,000 speakers. The large expatriate communities also speak their own
languages, the most numerous of which, according to 2018 data, are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_language"] Bengali (~1,500,000), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagalog_language"] Tagalog (~900,000),
 Eastern Punjabi (~800,000), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu"] Urdu (~740,000), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Arabic"] Egyptian Arabic (~600,000), Rohingya, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Levantine_Arabic"] North Levantine Arabic
(both ~500,000)[486] and Malayalam.[487]
Religions
Virtually all Saudi citizens are Muslim[488] (officially, all are), and almost all Saudi residents are Muslim.[489][490]
Estimates of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni"] Sunni population of Saudi Arabia range between 75% and 90%, with the remaining 10–25% being
 Shia Muslim.[491][492][493][494][495] The official and dominant form of Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia is commonly
known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism"] Wahhabism[496] (proponents prefer the name Salafism, considering Wahhabi derogatory[497]), which was
founded in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula"] Arabian Peninsula by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Abd_al-Wahhab"] Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab in the 18th century. Other denominations, such
as the minority [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam"] Shia Islam, are systematically suppressed.[498]
According to estimates there are about 1,500,000 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Saudi_Arabia"] Christians in Saudi Arabia, almost all foreign workers.[499] Saudi
Arabia allows Christians to enter the country as foreign workers for temporary work, but does not allow them to
practice their faith openly. The percentage of Saudi Arabian citizens who are Christians is officially zero,[500] as
Saudi Arabia forbids religious conversion from Islam (apostasy) and punishes it by death.[501] According to Pew
Research Center there are 390,000 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus"] Hindus in Saudi Arabia, almost all foreign workers.[502] There may be a
significant fraction of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism"] atheists and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism"] agnostics in Saudi Arabia,[503][504] although they are officially called
"terrorists".[505] In its 2017 religious freedom report, the US State Department named Saudi Arabia a Country of
Particular Concern (CPC).[506]
Education
Education is free at all levels, although higher education is restricted to citizens only.[507] The school system is
composed of elementary, intermediate, and secondary schools. Classes are segregated by sex. At secondary level,
students are able to choose from 3 types of schools: general education, vocational and technical, or religious.[508] The
Page 26
rate of literacy is 97.1% among males and is about 92.71% among females
(2017).[509] For the youth, literacy rate rose up to 99.55% among males and
99.45% among females (2020).[510][511]
According to the educational plan for secondary (high school) education
1435–1438 Hijri, students enrolling in the "natural sciences" path are required
to take five religion subjects which are: Tawhid, Fiqh, Tafseer, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith"] Hadith and
 Islamic Education and Quran. However, in 2021 the Saudi Ministry of
Education merged the multiple Islamic subjects into one single book as part of
a series of reforms to revamp the school education system.[512] In addition,
students are required to take six science subjects which are Maths, Physics,
Chemistry, Biology, Geology and Computer.[513] 
Laboratory buildings at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KAUST"] KAUST
 Higher education has expanded rapidly, with large numbers of universities
and colleges being founded particularly since 2000. Institutions of higher
education include the country's first university, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Saud_University"] King Saud University founded
 in 1957, the Islamic University at Medina founded in 1961, and the King
Abdulaziz University in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah"] Jeddah founded in 1967. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Nora_bint_Abdul_Rahman_University"] Princess Norah University,
 the largest women's university in the world, was founded in 1970. King
Abdullah University of Science and Technology, known as KAUST,
founded recently in 2009. Other colleges and universities emphasize curricula
in sciences and technology, military studies, religion, and medicine. Institutes
devoted to Islamic studies, in particular, abound. Women typically receive
college instruction in segregated institutions.[158]

among the 2022 world’s top universities and 23 universities among the top
 100 in the Arab world.[515] The 2022 list of U.S. News & World Report Best
Global University Ranking ranked King Abdulaziz University among the top
50 universities in the world and King Abdullah University of Science and
Technology among the top 100 universities in the world.
In 2018, Saudi Arabia ranked 28th worldwide in terms of high-quality
research output according to the scientific journal Nature.[516]This makes
Saudi Arabia the best performing Middle Eastern, Arab, and Muslim country. 
 UIS literacy rate Saudi Arabia
population, 15 plus, 1990–2015
Saudi Arabia spends 8.8% of its gross domestic product on education,
compared with the global average of 4.6%.[517] Saudi Arabia was ranked
66th in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Innovation_Index"] Global Innovation Index in 2021, up from 68th in 2019.[518][519][520][521]
Memorization by rote of large parts of the Qur'an, its interpretation and understanding (Tafsir) and the application of
Islamic tradition to everyday life is at the core of the curriculum. Religion taught in this manner is also a compulsory
subject for all University students.[522] As a consequence, Saudi youth "generally lacks the education and technical
skills the private sector needs" according to the CIA.[5] Similarly, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicle_of_Higher_Education"] The Chronicle of Higher Education wrote in 2010
that "the country needs educated young Saudis with marketable skills and a capacity for innovation and
entrepreneurship. That's not generally what Saudi Arabia's educational system delivers, steeped as it is in rote learning
and religious instruction."[523]
The religious sector of the Saudi national curriculum was examined in a 2006 report by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_House"] Freedom House which
concluded that "the Saudi public school religious curriculum continues to propagate an ideology of hate toward the
'unbeliever', that is, Christians, Jews, Shiites, Sufis, Sunni Muslims who do not follow Wahhabi doctrine, Hindus,
atheists and others".[524][525] The Saudi religious studies curriculum is taught outside the Kingdom via Saudi-linked
madrasah, schools, and clubs throughout the world.[526] Critics have described the education system as "medieval"
and that its primary goal "is to maintain the rule of absolute monarchy by casting it as the ordained protector of the
faith, and that Islam is at war with other faiths and cultures".[527] This radical teaching takes place in Saudi funded
mosques and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrasas"] madrasas across the Islamic world from Morocco to Pakistan to Indonesia.[528]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiqh"]

The approach taken in the Saudi education system has been accused of encouraging [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism"] Islamic terrorism, leading to
reform efforts.[529][530] Following the 9/11 attacks, the government aimed to tackle the twin problems of encouraging
extremism and the inadequacy of the country's university education for a modern economy, by slowly modernising
the education system through the "Tatweer" reform program.[529] The Tatweer program is reported to have a budget
of approximately US$2 billion and focuses on moving teaching away from the traditional Saudi methods of
memorization and rote learning towards encouraging students to analyse and problem-solve. It also aims to create an
education system which will provide a more secular and vocationally based training.[523][531]
In 2021, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post"] Washington Post newspaper published a report on the measures taken by Saudi Arabia to clean
textbooks from paragraphs considered anti-Semitic and anti-women. The paragraphs dealing with the punishment of
homosexuality or same-sex relations have been deleted, and expressions of admiration for the extremist martyrdom.
Anti-Semitic expressions and calls to fight the Jews became fewer. David Weinberg, director of international affairs
for the Anti-Defamation League in Washington, said that references to demonizing Jews, Christians, and Shiites have
been removed from some places or have toned down, noting the deletion of paragraphs that talk about killing gays,
infidels and witches. The US State Department expressed in an email that it welcomed the changes to the materials
affecting Saudi educational curricula. The Foreign Ministry supports a training program for Saudi teachers.[532]
Health care
Health care in Saudi Arabia is a national health care system in which the
government provides free health care services through a number of
government agencies. Saudi Arabia has been ranked among the 26 best
 countries in providing high quality healthcare.[533] The Saudi Ministry of
Health (MOH) is the major [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government"] government agency entrusted with the provision
of preventive, curative, and rehabilitative health care for the Kingdom's
population.The Ministry's origins can be traced to 1925, when a number of
regional health departments were established, with the first in Makkah, Saudi
Arabia.The various healthcare institutions were merged to become a
ministerial body in 1950.[534] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_bin_Faisal_Al_Saud"] Abdullah bin Faisal Al Saud was the first
health minister and served in the position for three years, with his main role to
set up the newly formed Ministry.[535] 
Historical development of life
expectancy in Saudi Arabia
The Health Ministry created a friendly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition"] competition between each of the districts, and between different medical
services and hospitals. This idea resulted in the creation of the "Ada'a" project launched in 2016. The new system is a
nationwide performance indicator, for services and hospitals. Following the implementation of the new KPI tables,
waiting times and other major measurements improved dramatically across the Kingdom.[536]
A new strategy has been developed by the Ministry, known as Diet and Physical Activity Strategy or DPAS for
short.[537] Many lifestyle issues in the country were causing bad lifestyle choices. This led to the Ministry advising
that there should be a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax"] tax increase on unhealthy food, drink and also cigarettes in the region. This additional tax could
be utilized to improve healthcare offerings. The tax was implemented in 2017.[538] As part of the same strategy,
calorie labels were added in 2019 to a number of food and drink products. Ingredients were also listed, not as an aim
to reduce obesity, but also for citizens with health issues, to manage their diet.[539] As part of the ongoing focus on
tackling obesity, women-only gyms were allowed to open in 2017. A number of sports were offered in each of these
 gyms, including bodybuilding, running and swimming to maintain higher standards of health.[540][541]Smoking in
Saudi-Arabia in all age groups was widespread. In 2009 the lowest median percentage of smokers was university
students (~13.5%) while the highest was elderly people (~25%). The study also found the median percentage of male
smokers to be much higher than that of females (~26.5% for males, ~9% for females). Before 2010, Saudi Arabia had
no policies banning or restricting smoking.
The MOH has been awarded "Healthy City" certificates by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization"] World Health Organization (WHO) for the cities of
 Unayzah and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh_Al_Khabra"] Riyadh Al Khabra as 4th and 5th Healthy Cities in Saudi Arabia.[542]The WHO had earlier classified
three Saudi Arabian cities, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_Diriyah"] Ad Diriyah, Jalajil, and Al-Jamoom as "Healthy city", as part of the WHO Healthy Cities
Program. Recently [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Baha"] Al-Baha has also been classified as a healthy city to join the list of global healthy cities approved
by the World Health Organization.[543]
Page 28
In May 2019, the then Saudi Minister of Health [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawfig_AlRabiah"] Dr. Tawfiq bin Fawzan AlRabiah received a global award on behalf
of the Kingdom for combatting smoking through social awareness, treatment, and application of regulations.[544] The
award was presented as part of the 72nd session of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Assembly"] World Health Assembly, held in Geneva in May 2019. After
becoming one of the first nations to ratify the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in 2005, it plans to
reduce tobacco use from 12.7% in 2017, to 5% in 2030.[544]
Saudi Arabia has a life expectancy of 74.99 years (73.79 for males and 76.61 for females) according to the latest data
for the year 2018 from the World Bank.[545] Infant mortality in 2019 was 5.7 per 1,000.[545] In 2016, 69.7% of the
adult population was overweight and 35.5% was obese.[546]
Foreigners
Saudi Arabia's Central Department of Statistics & Information estimated the foreign population at the end of 2014 at
33% (10.1 million).[547] The CIA Factbook estimated that as of 2013 foreign nationals living in Saudi Arabia made
up about 21% of the population.[5] Other sources report differing estimates.[468] Indian: 1.5 million, Pakistani: 1.3
million,[548] Egyptian: 900,000, Yemeni: 800,000, Bangladeshi: 400,000, Filipino: 500,000, Jordanian/Palestinian:
260,000, Indonesian: 250,000, Sri Lankan: 350,000, Sudanese: 250,000, Syrian: 100,000 and Turkish: 80,000.[549]
According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian"] The Guardian, as of 2013 there were more than half a million [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_domestic_workers"] foreign-born domestic workers in Saudi
Arabia. Most have backgrounds in poverty and come from Africa, the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.[550]
To go to work in Saudi Arabia, they must often pay large sums to recruitment agencies in their home countries. The
agencies then handle the necessary legal paperwork.[551]As the Saudi population grows and oil export revenues
stagnate, pressure for "Saudization" (the replacement of foreign workers with Saudis) has grown, and the Saudi
government hopes to decrease the number of foreign nationals in the country.[552] Saudi Arabia expelled 800,000
Yemenis in 1990 and 1991[553] and has built a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi%E2%80%93Yemen_barrier"] Saudi–Yemen barrier against an influx of illegal immigrants and
against the smuggling of drugs and weapons.[554] In November 2013, Saudi Arabia expelled thousands of illegal
Ethiopian residents from the Kingdom. Various Human Rights entities have criticized Saudi Arabia's handling of the
issue.[555] Over 500,000 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_in_Saudi_Arabia"] undocumented migrant workers — mostly from Somalia, Ethiopia, and Yemen — have
been detained and deported since 2013.[556] An investigation led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Telegraph"] The Sunday Telegraph, exposed the condition of
African migrants who were detained in Saudi Arabia allegedly for containing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019"] COVID-19 in the kingdom. They were
beaten, tortured, and electrocuted. Many of the migrants died due to heatstroke or by attempting suicide, after being
severely beaten and tortured. The migrants lack proper living conditions, provision of food and water.[557]
Foreigners cannot apply for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_residency"] permanent residency, though a specialized [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premium_Residency"] Premium Residency visa became available in
2019.[558] Only Muslims can become Saudi citizens.[559] Foreigners who have resided in the kingdom and hold
degrees in various scientific fields may apply for Saudi citizenship,[560][561] and exception made for Palestinians who
are excluded unless married to a male Saudi national, because of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League"] Arab League instructions barring the Arab states
from granting them citizenship. Saudi Arabia is not a signatory to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_relating_to_the_Status_of_Refugees"] 1951 UN Refugee Convention.[562]
Culture
Saudi Arabia has centuries-old attitudes and traditions, often derived from Arab civilization. The main factors that
influence the culture of Saudi Arabia are Islamic heritage and Bedouin traditions as well as its historical role as an
ancient trade centre.[563]
Religion in society
Religion is a core aspect of everyday life in Saudi Arabia. It plays a dominant role in the country's governance and
legal system, deeply influences culture and daily life, although the power of the religious establishment has been
significantly eroded in the 2010s.[23] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz"] Hejaz region, where the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiest_sites_in_Islam"] Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina are
located, is the destination of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj"] Ḥajj pilgrimage, and often deemed to be the cradle of Islam.[564][e]
Page 29
Islam is the state religion of Saudi Arabia. There is no law that requires all
citizens to be Muslim, but non-Muslims and many foreign and Saudi Muslims
whose beliefs are deemed not to conform with the government's interpretation
of Islam must practice their religion in private and are vulnerable to
discrimination, harassment, detention, and, for foreigners, deportation.[575]
 Neither Saudi citizens nor guest workers have the right of freedom of
religion.[576] The dominant form of Islam in the kingdom—Wahhabism—
arose in the central region of Najd, in the 18th century. Proponents call the
movement "Salafism",[497] and believe that its teachings purify the practice of
Islam of innovations or practices that deviate from the seventh-century
teachings of Muhammad and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahaba"] his companions.[577] The Saudi government
has often been viewed as an active oppressor of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam"] Shia Muslims because of the
funding of the Wahhabi ideology which denounces the Shia faith.[578][579]
Prince [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_bin_Sultan"] Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi ambassador to the United States, stated:
"The time is not far off in the Middle East when it will be literally 'God help
the Shia'. More than a billion Sunnis have simply had enough of them."[580] 
 Supplicating pilgrim at Al-Masjid Al-
Ḥarām (The Sacred Mosque) in
Mecca. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba"] Kaaba is the cubic
building in front of the pilgrim.
Saudi Arabia is one of the few countries that have "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_the_Promotion_of_Virtue_and_the_Prevention_of_Vice_(Saudi_Arabia)"] religious police" (known as Haia or Mutaween), who patrol the
streets "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enjoining_good_and_forbidding_wrong"] enjoining good and forbidding wrong" by enforcing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing_laws_by_country"] dress codes, strict [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_segregation"] separation of men and women,
attendance at prayer ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salat"] salat) five times each day, the ban on alcohol, and other aspects of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia"] Sharia (Islamic law).
However, since 2016 the power of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_the_Promotion_of_Virtue_and_the_Prevention_of_Vice_(Saudi_Arabia)"] religious police was curbed, which barred them from pursuing, questioning,
requesting identification or arresting suspects.[332] In the privacy of homes, behaviour can be far looser, and reports
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiLeaks"] WikiLeaks indicate that low ranked members of the ruling Saudi Royal family indulge in parties with alcohol,
drugs, and prostitutes.[581]
Until 2016, the kingdom only used the lunar [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar"] Islamic calendar, not the international [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar"] Gregorian calendar,[582] but in
2016 the kingdom announced its switch to the Gregorian calendar for civil purposes.[583][584] Daily life is influenced
by Islamic observance. Some businesses decide to close three or four times a day[585] for 30 to 45 minutes during
business hours while employees and customers are sent off to pray.[586][587] The weekend is Friday-Saturday, not
Saturday-Sunday because Friday is the holiest day for Muslims.[158][588] For many years only two religious holidays
were publicly recognized – [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BF%C4%AAd_al-Fi%E1%B9%ADr"] ʿĪd al-Fiṭr and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CA%BF%C4%AAd_al-A%E1%B8%8D%E1%B8%A5%C4%81"] ʿĪd al-Aḍḥā. (ʿĪd al-Fiṭr is "the biggest" holiday, a three-day period of
"feasting, gift-giving and general letting go").[589]
In 2004, approximately half of the broadcast airtime of Saudi [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_in_Saudi_Arabia#State-managed_stations"] state television was devoted to religious issues.[590] 90
per cent of books published in the kingdom were on religious subjects, and most of the doctorates awarded by its
universities were in Islamic studies.[591] In the state school system, about half of the material taught is religious. In
contrast, assigned readings over 12 years of primary and secondary schooling devoted to covering the history,
literature, and cultures of the non-Muslim world come to a total of about 40 pages.[590]
"Fierce religious resistance" had to be overcome to permit such innovations
as paper money (in 1951), female education (1964), and television (1965) and
the abolition of slavery (1962).[592] Public support for the traditional
political/religious structure of the kingdom is so strong that one researcherinterviewing Saudis found virtually no support for reforms to secularize the
state.[593]
Celebration of other (non-Wahhabi) Islamic holidays, such as the
 Muhammad's birthday and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_Ashura"] Day of Ashura, (an important holiday for the
10–25 per cent of the population[492][493][494] that is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia"] Shīʿa Muslim), are
tolerated only when celebrated locally and on a small scale.[594] Shias also
face systematic discrimination in employment, education, the justice system
according to Human Rights Watch.[595][596] Non-Muslim festivals like 
Non-Muslims are prohibited from
entering the Islamic holy city of
Mecca
Christmas, Easter, Halloween, and New Year were not tolerated until
recently.[597][598][599] No churches, temples or other non-Muslim houses of worship are permitted in the country.
 Proselytizing by non-Muslims and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostasy_in_Islam"] conversion by Muslims to another religion is illegal,[600] and as of 2014 the
distribution of "publications that have prejudice to any other religious belief other than Islam" (such as Bibles), was
Page 30
reportedly punishable by death.[601] In legal compensation court cases ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diyya"] Diyya) non-Muslim are awarded less than
Muslims.[602] Atheists are legally designated as terrorists.[603] At least one religious minority, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmadiyya"] Ahmadiyya
Muslims, had its adherents deported,[604] as they are legally banned from entering the country.[605]
In a recent move to promote a modern image, Saudi Arabia banned the religious group known as 'Tablighi Jamaat'.
The announcement was made on social media by the country's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Islamic_Affairs"] Minister of Islamic Affairs who warned people against
association during the Friday sermon.[606]
Women in society
Throughout history, women did not have equal rights to men in the kingdom; the
 U.S. State Department considers Saudi Arabian government's discrimination against
women a "significant problem" in Saudi Arabia and notes that women have few
 political rights due to the government's discriminatory policies.[607] The World
Economic Forum 2021 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Gender_Gap_Report"] Global Gender Gap Report ranked Saudi Arabia 147th out of
156 countries for gender parity.[608] However, since [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_bin_Salman,_Crown_Prince_of_Saudi_Arabia"] Mohammed bin Salman was
appointed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Prince_of_Saudi_Arabia"] Crown Prince in 2017, a series of social reforms have been witnessed
regarding women's rights.
Under Saudi law, every adult female must have a male relative as her "guardian"
([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wali_(Islamic_legal_guardian)"] wali),[607] As of 2008, a woman was required to have permission from her male
guardian in order to travel, study, or work.[607][609] A royal decree passed in May
2017 allowed them to avail government services such as education and healthcare
without the need of a consent of a male guardian. The order however also stated that
it should only be allowed if it does not contradict the Sharia system.[610][611]
According to a leading Saudi feminist and journalist, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wajeha_al-Huwaider"] Wajeha al-Huwaider, "Saudi
women are weak, no matter how high their status, even the 'pampered' ones among
them, because they have no law to protect them from attack by anyone."[612]
Women face discrimination in the courts, where the testimony of one man equals that
of two women [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_system_of_Saudi_Arabia#Family_law"] in family and inheritance law.[607] Polygamy is permitted for
men,[613] and men have a unilateral right to divorce their wives (talaq) without
needing any legal justification.[614] A woman can only obtain a divorce with the
consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her.[615] In practice, it
is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce.[615] With regard to the
law of inheritance, the Quran specifies that fixed portions of the deceased's estate
must be left to the Qur'anic heirs[616] and generally, female heirs receive half the
portion of male heirs.[616] 
 Sarah Attar is a track and
field athlete who competed
 at the 2012 Summer
Olympics as one of the first
two female Olympians
representing Saudi Arabia.
Obesity is a problem among middle and upper-class Saudis who have domestic servants to do traditional work but,
until 2018, were forbidden to drive and so are limited in their ability to leave their home.[617] As of April 2014, Saudi
authorities in the education ministry have been asked by the Shoura Council to consider lifting a state school ban on
sports for girls with the proviso that any sports conform to Sharia rules on dress and gender segregation, according to
the official SPA news agency.[401] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_religious_police"] religious police, known as the mutawa, imposed many restrictions on women
in public in Saudi Arabia.[607][618] The restrictions include forcing women to sit in separate specially designated
family sections in restaurants, to wear an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaya"] abaya and to cover their hair.[607] However, in 2016, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultative_Assembly_of_Saudi_Arabia"] Saudi cabinet has
drastically reduced the power of the religious police and barred it "from pursuing, questioning, asking for
identification, arresting and detaining anyone suspected of a crime".
A few Saudi women have risen to the top of the medical profession; for example, Dr. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adah_Almutairi"] Ghada Al-Mutairi heads a
 medical research centre in California[619] and Dr. Salwa Al-Hazzaa is head of the ophthalmology department at King
Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh and was the late King Fahad's personal ophthalmologist.[620]
Heritage sites
Page 31
Saudi [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism"] Wahhabism is hostile to any reverence given to historical or religious
places of significance for fear that it may give rise to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirk_(Islam)"] 'shirk' (idolatry), and the
most significant historic Muslim sites (in Mecca and Medina) are located in
the western Saudi region of the Hejaz.[564] As a consequence, under Saudi
rule, an estimated 95% of Mecca's historic buildings, most over a thousand
years old, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_early_Islamic_heritage_sites_in_Saudi_Arabia"] have been demolished for religious reasons.[621] Critics claim that
over the last 50 years, 300 historic sites linked to Muhammad, his family or
companions have been lost,[622] leaving fewer than 20 structures remaining The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masjid_al-Haram"] Masjid al-Haram is the holiest
in Mecca that date back to the time of Muhammad.[623] Demolished [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic"] Islamic site, located in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca"] Mecca
structures include the mosque originally built by Muhammad's daughter
Fatima, and other mosques founded by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Bakr"] Abu Bakr (Muhammad's father-in-
 law and the first Caliph), Umar (the second Caliph), Ali (Muhammad's son-in-law and the fourth Caliph), and Salman
al-Farsi (another of Muhammad's companions).[624]
Six cultural sites in Saudi Arabia are designated as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_World_Heritage_Sites"] UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Al-Hijr Archaeological Site
 (Madâin Sâlih);[625] the Turaif district in the city of Diriyah;[626] Historic Jeddah, the Gate to Mecca;[627] Al-Ahsa
Oasis;[628] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_Art_in_the_Ha%27il_Region"] Rock Art in the Hail Region;[629] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bir_Hima_Rock_Petroglyphs_and_Inscriptions"] Ḥimā Cultural Area.[630] Ten other sites submitted requests for
recognition to UNESCO in 2015.[631] 
 There are six elements inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage
of Humanity list:[632] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qatt_Al-Asiri"] Al-Qatt Al-Asiri, female traditional interior wall
decoration in Asir; Almezmar, drumming and dancing with sticks; Falconry,
a living human heritage; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_coffee"] Arabic coffee, a symbol of generosity; Majlis, a
cultural and social space; Alardah Alnajdiyah, dance, drumming and poetry
in Saudi Arabia.
 In June 2014, the Council of Ministers approved a law that gives the Saudi
Commission for Tourism and National Heritage the means to protect Saudi
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque_of_the_Prophet"] Mosque of the Prophet in
 Medina containing the tomb of
 Muhammad 
Arabia's ancient relics and historic sites. Within the framework of the 2016
National Transformation Program, also known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Vision_2030"] Saudi Vision 2030, the
kingdom allocated 900 million euros to preserve its historical and cultural
heritage.[633] Saudi Arabia also participates in the International Alliance for
the Protection of Heritage in Conflict Areas (ALIPH), created in March 2017,
with a contribution of 18.5 million euros.[634]
In 2017, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman promised to return Saudi Arabia to the "moderate Islam" of the era
before the 1979 Iranian revolution.[635] A new centre, the King Salman Complex for the Prophet's Hadith, was
established that year to monitor interpretations of the Prophet Mohammed's hadiths to prevent them being used to
justifying terrorism.[636]
In March 2018, the Crown Prince met the Archbishop of Canterbury during a visit to the UK, pledging to promote
interfaith dialogue. In Riyadh the following month King Salman met the head of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for
Interreligious Dialogue.[637] In July 2019, UNESCO signed a letter with the Saudi Minister of Culture in which
Saudi Arabia contributed US$25 million to UNESCO for the preservation of heritage.[638]
Dress
Saudi Arabian dress strictly follows the principles of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijab"] hijab (the Islamic principle of modesty, especially in dress). The
predominantly loose and flowing, but covering, garments are suited to Saudi Arabia's desert climate. Traditionally,
men usually wear a white ankle-length garment woven from wool or cotton (known as a thawb), with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffiyeh"] keffiyeh (a
large checkered square of cotton held in place by an agal) or a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffiyeh"] ghutra (a plain white square made of a finer cotton,
also held in place by an agal) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a camel-hair cloak (bisht) over
the top. In public women are required to wear a black [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abaya"] abaya or other black clothing that covers everything under the
neck with the exception of their hands and feet, although most women cover their head in respect of their religion.
Page 32
This requirement applies to non-Muslim women too and failure to abide can result in police action, particularly in
more conservative areas of the country. Women's clothes are often decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins,
metallic thread, and appliques.
 Ghutrah (Arabic: ‎غتره) is a traditional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headdress"] headdress typically worn by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab"] Arab men. It is made of a square of
cloth ("scarf"), usually cotton, folded and wrapped in various styles around the head. It is commonly
worn in areas with an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arid"] arid climate, to provide protection from direct [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_exposure"] sun exposure, and also protection
of the mouth and eyes from blown dust and sand.
 Agal (Arabic: ‎عقال) is an item of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab"] Arab headgear constructed of cord which is fastened around the
 Ghutrah to hold it in place. The agal is usually black in colour.
 Thawb (Arabic: ‎ثوب) is the standard Arabic word for garment. It is ankle-length, usually with long
sleeves, similar to a robe.
 Bisht (Arabic: ‎بشت) is a traditional Arabic men's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloak"] cloak usually only worn for prestige on special
occasions such as weddings.
 Abaya (Arabic: ‎عبائة) is a woman's garment. It is a black cloak that loosely covers the entire body
except for the head. Some women choose to cover their faces with a niqāb and some do not. Some
abayas cover the top of the head as well.[639]
Arts and entertainment
During the 1970s, cinemas were numerous in the Kingdom although they were seen
as contrary to Wahhabi norms.[640] During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_revival"] Islamic revival movement in the
1980s, and as a political response to an increase in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamist"] Islamist activism including the
1979 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Mosque_Seizure"] seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca, the government closed all cinemas
and theatres. However, with King Abdullah and King Salman's reforms, cinemas
re-opened,[641] including one in KAUST.
From the 18th century onward, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabi"] Wahhabi fundamentalism discouraged artistic
development inconsistent with its teaching. In addition, Sunni Islamic prohibition of
creating representations of people have limited the visual arts, which tend to be
dominated by geometric, floral, and abstract designs and by calligraphy. With the
advent of the oil-wealth in the 20th century came exposure to outside influences,
such as Western housing styles, furnishings, and clothes. Music and dance have
always been part of Saudi life. Traditional music is generally associated with poetry
and is sung collectively. Instruments include the rabābah, an instrument not unlike a 
King Abdullah practising
falconry, a traditional pursuit
in the country
three-string fiddle, and various types of percussion instruments, such as the ṭabl
(drum) and the ṭār (tambourine). Of the native dances, the most popular is a martial
line dance known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardah"] arḍah, which includes lines of men, frequently armed with swords or rifles, dancing to the
beat of drums and tambourines. Bedouin poetry, known as nabaṭī, is still very popular.[158]
Censorship has limited the development of Saudi literature, although several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Saudi_Arabian_writers"] Saudi novelists and poets have achieved
critical and popular acclaim in the Arab world—albeit generating official hostility in their home country. These
 include Ghazi Algosaibi, Mansour al-Nogaidan, Abdelrahman Munif, Turki al-Hamad and Rajaa al-
Sanea.[642][643][644] In 2016, the General Entertainment Authority was formed to oversee the expansion of the Saudi
entertainment sector.[645]The first concerts in Riyadh for 25 years took place the following year.[646] Other events
since the GEA's creation have included comedy shows, professional wrestling events and monster truck rallies.[647]
In 2018 the first public cinema opened after a ban of 35 years, with plans to have more than 2,000 screens running by
2030.[648]
Developments in the arts in 2018 included Saudi Arabia's debut appearances at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival"] Cannes Film Festival and the
 Venice Biennale.[649][650] Guetta's comments come as Saudi Arabia increasingly attracts big name western music
acts to perform in the kingdom.[651]
Cuisine
Page 33
 Saudi Arabian cuisine is similar to that of the surrounding countries in the Arabian
Peninsula and the wider Arab world, and has influenced and been influenced by
Turkish, Indian, Persian, and African food. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_dietary_laws"] Islamic dietary laws are enforced: pork is not
allowed and other animals are slaughtered in accordance with halal. Kebabs and falafel
are popular, as is shāwarmā (shawarma), a marinated grilled meat dish of lamb, mutton,
or chicken. As in other Arab countries of the Arabian Peninsula, machbūs (kabsa), a rice
dish with lamb, chicken, fish or shrimp, is among the national dishes as well as the dish
mandi. Flat, unleavened [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboon_bread"] taboon bread is a staple of virtually every meal, as are dates,
fresh fruit, yoghurt, and hummus. Coffee, served in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_coffee"] Arabic style, is the traditional
beverage but tea and various fruit juices are popular as well.[158] Arabic coffee is a
traditional beverage in Arabian cuisine. The earliest substantiated evidence of either
 coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree is from the 15th century, in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufi"] Sufi
monasteries of Arabia.
Sport 
 Arabic coffee is a
traditional beverage in
Arabian cuisine
 Football is the national sport in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabia national
football team is considered one of Asia's most successful national teams,
having reached a joint record 6 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Asian_Cup"] AFC Asian Cup finals, winning three of those
finals (1984, 1988, and 1996) and having qualified for the World Cup four
 consecutive times ever since debuting at the 1994 tournament.In the 1994
FIFA World Cup under the leadership of Jorge Solari, Saudi Arabia beat both
Belgium and Morocco in the group stage before falling to defeat Sweden in
the round of 16. During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_King_Fahd_Cup"] 1992 FIFA Confederations Cup, which was
played in Saudi Arabia, the country reached the final, losing 1–3 to 
Uruguay – Saudi Arabia match at the
 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia
Argentina.Scuba diving, windsurfing, sailing and basketball (which is played
by both men and women) are also popular with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia_national_basketball_team"] Saudi Arabian national basketball team winning bronze at the
 1999 Asian Championship.[652][653][654] More traditional sports such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing"] horse racing and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_racing"] camel racing are also
popular. A stadium in Riyadh holds races in the winter. The annual King's Camel Race, begun in 1974, is one of the
sport's most important contests and attracts animals and riders from throughout the region. Falconry, another
traditional pursuit, is still practised.[158]
Women's sport is controversial due to the suppression of female participation in sport by conservative Islamic
religious authorities,[655] however this restriction has eased slightly in recent years.[656][657][658] Until 2018 women
were not permitted in sport stadiums. Segregated seating, allowing women to enter, has been developed in three
stadiums across major cities.[659]
Saudi Arabia, in its vision for modernization, introduced the nation to a number of international sporting events,
bringing sports stars to the Kingdom. However, in August 2019, the kingdom's strategy received criticism for
appearing as a method of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportswashing"] sportswashing soon after Saudi's US-based 2018 lobbying campaign foreign registration
documentations got published online. The documents showed Saudi Arabia as allegedly implementing a
'sportswashing' strategy, inclusive of meetings and official calls with supreme authorities of associations like the
Major League Soccer (MLS), World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), National Basketball Association (NBA). The
strategy is being viewed as a method of sportswashing following the chaos spread across Yemen for 6 years.[660]
TV and Media
Television was introduced in Saudi Arabia in 1954. Saudi Arabia is a major market for pan-Arab satellite and pay-
TV. Among the major Saudi-owned broadcasting companies are the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBC_Group"] Middle East Broadcasting Center, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotana_Group"] Rotana and
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Broadcasting_Authority"] Saudi Broadcasting Authority which control a large share of the pan-Arab broadcasting market.[661] The Saudi
government closely monitors media and restricts it under official state law. Changes have been made to lessen theserestrictions; however, some government-led efforts to control information have also drawn international attention. As
of 2022, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporters_Without_Borders"] Reporters Without Borders rates the Kingdom's press "Very Serious" situation.[662]
Page 34
Most of the early [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspapers"] newspapers in the Persian Gulf region were established in
Saudi Arabia.[663] The first newspaper founded in the country and in the Persian
Gulf area is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Fallah"] Al Fallah, which was launched in 1920,[663] and the first English-
language newspaper is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_News"] Arab News, which was launched in 1975.[664] All of the
newspapers published in Saudi Arabia are privately owned.[665]
 Saudi Arabia received access to the Internet in 1994.[666] According to World
Bank, as of 2020, 98% of the population of Saudi Arabia are Internet users
which puts it in the 8th rank among countries with the highest percentage of
internet users.[667] Saudi Arabia has one of the fastest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G"] 5G internet speeds in the
world.[668][669] Saudi Arabia is the 27th largest market for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce"] e-commerce with a
revenue of US$8 billion in 2021, placing it ahead of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium"] Belgium and behind
Norway.[670]

Notes
a. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahada"] Shahādah (Statement of faith) is sometimes translated into English as 'There is no god but Allah',
using the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization"] romanization of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language"] Arabic word [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah"] Allāh instead of its translation. The word Allāh (Arabic: ‎ٱلله)
literally translates as the God, as the prefix 'Al-' is the definite article.[2][3][4]
b. There is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consultative_Assembly_of_Saudi_Arabia"] Consultative Assembly, or Shura Council, which has no legislative power.[10] As its role is
only consultative it is not considered to be a legislature.[11]
c. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˌsɔːdi əˈreɪbiə/ (  listen), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˌsaʊ-/ (  listen); Arabic: ‎ة ‎َّي ‎ِد ‎ْو ‎ُع ‎ٱلُّس As-Suʿūdīyah
d. Arabic: ‎ة ‎َّي ‎ِد ‎ْو ‎ُع ‎ٱلُّس ‎ة ‎َّي ‎ِب ‎َر ‎َع ‎ٱْل ‎ة ‎َك ‎َل ‎ْم ‎َم ‎ٱْل al-Mamlakah al-ʿArabīyah as-Suʿūdīyah,  pronunciation 
e. A number of Muslims, using justifications from the Quran,[565][566][567] insist that Islam did not begin
with Muhammad, but that it represents even previous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet"] Prophets such as Abraham,[568][569][570][571]
who is credited with having established the sanctuary of Mecca.[572][573][574]

412. House, p. 161: "Over the past decade, the government has announced one plan after another to
'Saudize' the economy, but to no avail. The foreign workforce grows, and so does unemployment
among Saudis. .... The previous plan called for slashing unemployment to 2.8% only to see it rise to
10.5% in 2009, the end of that plan period. Government plans in Saudi are like those in the old Soviet
Union, grandiose but unmet. (Also, as in the old Soviet Union, nearly all Saudi official statistics are
unreliable, so economists believe the real Saudi unemployment rate is closer to 40%)"
