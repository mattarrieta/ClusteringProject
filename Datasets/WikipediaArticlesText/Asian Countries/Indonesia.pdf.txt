Indonesia,[a] officially the Republic of Indonesia,[b] is a country in
 Southeast Asia and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania"] Oceania between the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean"] Indian and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean"] Pacific oceans. It
consists of over [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_islands_of_Indonesia"] 17,000 islands, including Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, and
 parts of Borneo and New Guinea. Indonesia is the world's largest island
country and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area"] 14th-largest country by area, at 1,904,569 square
kilometres (735,358 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_mile"] square miles).  With over 270 million people,
Indonesia is the world's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population"] fourth-most populous country and the most
 populous Muslim-majority country. Java, the world's most populous
island, is home to more than half of the country's population.
 Indonesia is a presidential republic with an elected legislature. It has 34
provinces, of which five have [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_administrative_division"] special status. The country's capital,
Jakarta, is the world's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cities"] second-most populous urban area. Indonesia shares
 land borders with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea"] Papua New Guinea, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor"] East Timor, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Malaysia"] eastern part of
Malaysia, as well as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_border"] maritime borders with Singapore, Vietnam,
 Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, Palau, and India (Andaman and
Nicobar Islands).  Despite its large population and densely populated
regions, Indonesia has vast areas of wilderness that support one of the
 world's highest levels of biodiversity.
The Indonesian archipelago has been a valuable region for trade since at
least the 7th century when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srivijaya"] Srivijaya and later [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majapahit"] Majapahit traded with
entities from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_China"] mainland China and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent"] Indian subcontinent. Local rulers
gradually absorbed foreign influences from the early centuries, and
 Hindu and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_Indonesia"] Buddhist kingdoms flourished. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam"] Sunni traders and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufism"] Sufi
 scholars brought Islam, while Christianity was spread by European
missionaries. Although the Portuguese, the French, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_British_interregnum_in_the_Dutch_East_Indies#British_interregnum_1811%E2%80%931816"] British also
ruled at some point, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies#History"] Dutch were the foremost [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Empire"] colonial power for
much of their 350-year presence in the archipelago. The concept of
"Indonesia" as a nation-state [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_National_Awakening"] emerged in the early 20th century,
culminating later in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_Indonesian_Independence"] proclamation of Indonesian Independence in
1945. However, it was not until 1949 that the Dutch recognised
 Indonesia's sovereignty following an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_National_Revolution"] armed and diplomatic conflict
between the two.
Indonesia consists of hundreds of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Indonesia"] distinct native ethnic and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Indonesia"] linguistic
groups, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_people"] Javanese being the largest. A shared identity has developed
with the motto "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhinneka_Tunggal_Ika"] Bhinneka Tunggal Ika" ("Unity in Diversity" literally,
"many, yet one"),  defined by a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_language"] national language, cultural diversity,
religious pluralism within a Muslim-majority population, and a history of
colonialism and rebellion against it. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Indonesia"] economy of Indonesia is the
world's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)"] 17th-largest by nominal GDP and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)"] 7th-largest by PPP. It is a
 regional power and is considered a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_power"] middle power in global affairs. The
country is a member of several multilateral organisations, including the
 United Nations, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"] World Trade Organization, G20, and a founding member
of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement"] Non-Aligned Movement, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN"] Association of Southeast Asian Nations,

After 1900, Indonesia became more common in academic circles outside the Netherlands, and native nationalist groups
adopted it for political expression.[19] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Bastian"] Adolf Bastian of the University of Berlin popularized the name through his book
 Indonesien oder die Inseln des Malayischen Archipels, 1884–1894. The first native scholar to use the name was Ki Hajar
Dewantara when in 1913, he established a press bureau in the Netherlands, Indonesisch Pers-bureau.[15]
History
Early history
Fossilised remains of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus"] Homo erectus, popularly known as the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Man"] Java Man", suggest the
Indonesian archipelago was inhabited two million to 500,000 years ago.[21][22][23]
 Homo sapiens reached the region around 43,000 BCE.[24] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_people"] Austronesian peoples,
who form the majority of the modern population, migrated to Southeast Asia from
what is now Taiwan. They arrived in the archipelago around 2,000 BCE and
confined the native [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanesians"] Melanesian peoples to the far eastern regions as they spread
east.[25] Ideal agricultural conditions and the mastering of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_field"] wet-field rice cultivation as
early as the eighth century BCE[26] allowed villages, towns, and small kingdoms to
flourish by the first century CE. The archipelago's strategic sea-lane position fostered
inter-island and international trade, including with Indian kingdoms and Chinese
dynasties, from several centuries BCE.[27] Trade has since fundamentally shaped
Indonesian history.[28][29]

From the seventh century CE, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srivijaya"] Srivijaya naval kingdom flourished due to trade 1st century CE.[20]
and the influences of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism"] Hinduism and Buddhism.[30][31] Between the eighth and tenth
centuries CE, the agricultural Buddhist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailendra"] Sailendra and Hindu [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mataram_Kingdom"] Mataram dynasties thrived and declined in inland Java, leaving
grand religious monuments such as Sailendra's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borobudur"] Borobudur and Mataram's Prambanan. The Hindu [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majapahit"] Majapahit kingdom was
founded in eastern Java in the late 13th century, and under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gajah_Mada"] Gajah Mada, its influence stretched over much of present-day
Indonesia. This period is often referred to as a "Golden Age" in Indonesian history.[32]
 The earliest evidence of Islamized populations in the archipelago dates to the 13th century in northern Sumatra.[33] Other
parts of the archipelago gradually adopted Islam, and it was the dominant religion in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java"] Java and Sumatra by the end of the 16th
century. For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and religious influences, which shaped the
predominant form of Islam in Indonesia, particularly in Java.[34]
Colonial era 
The first Europeans arrived in the archipelago in 1512, when Portuguese traders, led
 by Francisco Serrão, sought to monopolise the sources of nutmeg, cloves, and cubeb
pepper in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maluku_Islands"] Maluku Islands.[35] Dutch and British traders followed. In 1602, the
Dutch established the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_India_Company"] Dutch East India Company (VOC) and became the dominant
European power for almost 200 years. The VOC was dissolved in 1800 following
bankruptcy, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batavian_Republic"] Netherlands established the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies"] Dutch East Indies as a nationalised
colony.[36]

For most of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Indonesia#Colonial_era"] colonial period, Dutch control over the archipelago was tenuous.
Dutch forces were engaged continuously in quelling rebellions both on and off Java.
 The influence of local leaders such as Prince Diponegoro in central Java, Imam
Bonjol in central Sumatra, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattimura"] Pattimura in Maluku, and the bloody [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aceh_War"] 30-year war in Aceh
weakened the Dutch and tied up the colonial military forces.[37][38][39] Only in the
early 20th century did Dutch dominance extend to what was to become Indonesia's current boundaries.[39][40][41][42]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_East_Indies_campaign"] Japanese invasion and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_the_Dutch_East_Indies"] subsequent occupation during World War II ended Dutch rule[43][44][45] and encouraged the
previously suppressed independence movement.[46] Two days after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan"] surrender of Japan in August 1945, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukarno"] Sukarno and
 Mohammad Hatta, influential nationalist leaders, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proclamation_of_Indonesian_Independence"] proclaimed Indonesian independence and were appointed president and
vice-president, respectively.[47][48][49][47][50]
Page 4
The Netherlands attempted to re-establish their rule, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_National_Revolution"] a bitter armed and diplomatic struggle ended in December 1949
when the Dutch formally recognised Indonesian independence in the face of international pressure and transferred
sovereignty to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_Indonesia"] United States of Indonesia.[51][49][52] Despite extraordinary political, social and sectarian divisions,
Indonesians, on the whole, found unity in their fight for independence.[53][54]
Post-World War II

As president, Sukarno moved Indonesia from democracy towards authoritarianism and maintained power by balancing the
opposing forces of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_National_Armed_Forces"] the military, political Islam, and the increasingly powerful [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Indonesia"] Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI).[55]
Tensions between the military and the PKI culminated in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/30_September_Movement"] an attempted coup in 1965. The army, led by Major General
Suharto, countered by instigating a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_mass_killings_of_1965%E2%80%9366"] violent anti-communist purge that killed between 500,000 and one million
people.[56][57][58] The PKI was blamed for the coup and effectively destroyed.[59][60][61] Suharto capitalised on Sukarno's
weakened position, and following a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_to_the_New_Order"] drawn-out power play with Sukarno, Suharto was appointed president in March 1968.
His [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Order_(Indonesia)"] "New Order" administration,[62] supported by the United States,[63][64][65] encouraged [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment"] foreign direct investment,[66][67]
which was a crucial factor in the subsequent three decades of substantial economic growth.
Indonesia was the country hardest hit by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis"] 1997 Asian financial crisis.[68] It brought out [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1998_riots_of_Indonesia#Background"] popular discontent with the New
Order's corruption and suppression of political opposition and ultimately ended Suharto's presidency.[43][69][70][71] In 1999,
East Timor seceded from Indonesia, following its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_invasion_of_East_Timor"] 1975 invasion by Indonesia[72] and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_occupation_of_East_Timor"] 25-year occupation marked by
international condemnation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor_genocide"] human rights abuses.[73]
 Since 1998, democratic processes have been strengthened by enhancing regional autonomy and instituting the country's first
direct presidential election in 2004.[74] Political, economic and social instability, corruption, and instances of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_Indonesia"] terrorism (the
deadliest being the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Bali_bombings"] 2002 Bali bombings) remained problems in the 2000s; however, the economy has performed strongly in
the last 15 years. Although relations among the diverse population are mostly harmonious, acute sectarian discontent and
violence remain a problem in some areas.[75][76] A political settlement to an armed separatist conflict in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aceh"] Aceh was achieved
in 2005 following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami"] 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that killed 130,000 Indonesians.[77]
Geography
Indonesia lies between latitudes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_parallel_south"] 11°S and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6th_parallel_north"] 6°N, and longitudes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/95th_meridian_east"] 95°E and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/141st_meridian_east"] 141°E. It is

east to west and 1,760 kilometres (1,094 mi) from north to south.[78] The country's
 Coordinating Ministry for Maritime and Investments Affairs says Indonesia has
17,504 islands (with 16,056 registered at the UN)[79] scattered over both sides of the
equator, around 6,000 of which are inhabited.[80] The largest are Sumatra, Java,
 Borneo (shared with Brunei and Malaysia), Sulawesi, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea"] New Guinea (shared with

Climate
 Rainforest in Mount Palung National
Park, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Kalimantan"] West Kalimantan 
Indonesia lies along the equator, and its climate tends to be relatively even year-
round.[83] Indonesia has two seasons—a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_season"] wet season and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dry_season"] dry season—with no
extremes of summer or winter.[84] For most of Indonesia, the dry season falls
between May and October, with the wet season between November and April.[84]
 Indonesia's climate is almost entirely tropical, dominated by the tropical rainforest
climate found in every large island of Indonesia. More cooling climate types do exist
in mountainous regions that are 1,300 to 1,500 metres (4,300 to 4,900 feet) above sea
level. The oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb) prevails in highland areas adjacent to
rainforest climates, with reasonably uniform precipitation year-round. In highland
areas near the tropical monsoon and tropical savanna climates, the subtropical
highland climate (Köppen Cwb) is prevalent with a more pronounced dry season.
Some regions, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalimantan"] Kalimantan and Sumatra, experience only slight differences in
rainfall and temperature between the seasons, whereas others, such as Nusa
Tenggara, experience far more pronounced differences with droughts in the dry
season and floods in the wet. Rainfall varies across regions, with more in western
Sumatra, Java, and the interiors of Kalimantan and Papua, and less in areas closer to
Australia, such as Nusa Tenggara, which tend to be dry. The almost uniformly warm
waters that constitute 81% of Indonesia's area ensure that land temperatures remain [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ppen_climate_classification"] Köppen-Geiger climate classification
relatively constant. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity"] Humidity is quite high, at between 70 and 90%.  Winds are map for Indonesia[85]
moderate and generally predictable, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon"] monsoons usually blowing in from the
south and east in June through October and from the northwest in November through
March. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon"] Typhoons and large-scale storms pose little hazard to mariners; significant dangers come from swift currents in
channels, such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombok_Strait"] Lombok and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sape_Strait"] Sape straits.[86]
Several studies consider Indonesia to be at severe risk from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_Indonesia"] projected effects of climate change.[87] These include
unreduced emissions resulting in an average temperature rise of around 1 °C (2 °F) by mid-century,[88][89] raising the
frequency of drought and food shortages (with an impact on precipitation and the patterns of wet and dry seasons, and thus
Indonesia's agriculture system[89]) as well as numerous diseases and wildfires.[89] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise"] Rising sea levels would also threaten the
majority of Indonesia's population who lives in low-lying coastal areas.[89][90][91] Impoverished communities would likely be
affected the most by climate change.[92]
Geology
Major volcanoes in Indonesia.
 Indonesia is in the Pacific Ring of
Fire area. 
Tectonically, most of Indonesia's area is highly unstable, making it a site of numerous
volcanoes and frequent earthquakes.[93] It lies on the Pacific [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire"] Ring of Fire where the
 Indo-Australian Plate and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Plate"] Pacific Plate are pushed under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_plate"] Eurasian plate,
where they melt at about 100 kilometres (62 miles) deep. A string of volcanoes runs
through Sumatra, Java, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali"] Bali and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusa_Tenggara"] Nusa Tenggara, and then to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banda_Islands"] Banda Islands of
 Maluku to northeastern Sulawesi.[94] Of the 400 volcanoes, around 130 are
active.[93] Between 1972 and 1991, there were 29 volcanic eruptions, mostly on

Indonesia's size, tropical climate, and archipelagic geography support one of the world's highest levels of biodiversity and is
among the 17 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megadiverse_countries"] megadiverse countries identified by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_International"] Conservation International. Its flora and fauna is a mixture of Asian and
 Australasian species.[101] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunda_Shelf"] Sunda Shelf islands (Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Bali) were once linked to mainland Asia and
have a wealth of Asian fauna. Large species such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatran_tiger"] Sumatran tiger, rhinoceros, orangutan, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant"] Asian elephant, and leopard
were once abundant as far east as Bali, but numbers and distribution have dwindled drastically. Having been long separated
from the continental landmasses, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku have developed their unique flora and
fauna.[102][103] Papua was part of the Australian landmass and is home to a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauna_of_New_Guinea"] unique fauna and flora closely related to that of
Australia, including over 600 bird species.[104]
Indonesia is second only to Australia in terms of total endemic species, with 36% of its 1,531 species of bird and 39% of its
515 species of mammal being endemic.[105] Tropical seas surround Indonesia's 80,000 kilometres (50,000 miles) of coastline.
The country has a range of sea and coastal ecosystems, including beaches, dunes, estuaries, mangroves, coral reefs, seagrass
beds, coastal mudflats, tidal flats, algal beds, and small island ecosystems.[14] Indonesia is one of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Triangle"] Coral Triangle countries
with the world's most enormous diversity of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef_fish"] coral reef fish, with more than 1,650 species in eastern Indonesia only.[106]
British naturalist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace"] Alfred Russel Wallace described a dividing line ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Line"] Wallace Line) between the distribution of Indonesia's Asian
and Australasian species.[107] It runs roughly north–south along the edge of the Sunda Shelf, between Kalimantan and
Sulawesi, and along the deep [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombok_Strait"] Lombok Strait, between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombok"] Lombok and Bali. Flora and fauna on the west of the line are generally
Asian, while east from Lombok, they are increasingly Australian until the tipping point at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_Line"] Weber Line. In his 1869 book,
 The Malay Archipelago, Wallace described numerous species unique to the area.[108] The region of islands between his line
and New Guinea is now termed Wallacea.[107]
Indonesia's large and growing population and rapid industrialisation present serious
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues_in_Indonesia"] environmental issues. They are often given a lower priority due to high poverty levels
and weak, under-resourced governance.[109] Problems include the destruction of
 peatlands, large-scale illegal deforestation (causing extensive haze across parts of
Southeast Asia),  over-exploitation of marine resources, air pollution, garbage
management, and reliable [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_supply_and_sanitation_in_Indonesia"] water and wastewater services.[109] These issues contribute
to Indonesia's low ranking (number 116 out of 180 countries) in the 2020
 Environmental Performance Index. The report also indicates that Indonesia's
performance is generally below average in both regional and global context.[110]
Indonesia reportedly has one of the fastest deforestation rates in the world.[111][112]
In 2018, forests cover approximately 49.7% of the country's land area,[113] down
from 87% in 1950.[114] Starting in 1970s, and continuing up to the present day, log

production, various plantations and agriculture have been responsible for much of the
 deforestation in Indonesia.[114] Most recently, it has been driven by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_oil"] palm oil
industry.[115] Such industries have been criticised for their environmental impact and displacement of local
communities.[116][117] The situation has made Indonesia the world's largest forest-based emitter of greenhouse gases.[118] It
also threatens the survival of indigenous and endemic species. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature"] International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
 identified 140 species of mammals as threatened and 15 as critically endangered, including the Bali myna,[119] Sumatran
orangutan,[120] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javan_rhinoceros"] Javan rhinoceros.[121]
Government and politics
Page 7
 Indonesia is a republic with a presidential system. Following the fall of the New
Order in 1998, political and governmental structures have undergone sweeping
reforms, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Indonesia#Constitutional_amendments"] four constitutional amendments revamping the executive, legislative
and judicial branches.[122] Chief among them is the delegation of power and
authority to various regional entities while remaining a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_state"] unitary state.[123] The
 President of Indonesia is the head of state and head of government, commander-in-
chief of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_National_Armed_Forces"] Indonesian National Armed Forces (Tentara Nasional Indonesia, TNI),
and the director of domestic governance, policy-making, and foreign affairs. The
president may serve a maximum of two consecutive five-year terms.[124]  A presidential inauguration by the
 The highest representative body at the national level is the People's Consultative
Assembly (Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat,  MPR).  Its main functions are 
MPR in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPR/MPR_Building"] Parliament Complex

supporting and amending the constitution, inaugurating and impeaching the
 president,[125][126] and formalising broad outlines of state policy. The MPR comprises two houses; the People's
Representative Council (Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat, DPR), with 575 members, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Representative_Council"] Regional Representative Council
(Dewan Perwakilan Daerah, DPD), with 136.[127] The DPR passes legislation and monitors the executive branch. Reforms
since 1998 have markedly increased its role in national governance,[122] while the DPD is a new chamber for matters of
regional management.[128][126]
Most civil disputes appear before the State Court (Pengadilan Negeri); appeals are heard before the High Court (Pengadilan
Tinggi). The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Indonesia"] Supreme Court of Indonesia (Mahkamah Agung) is the highest level of the judicial branch and hears final
cessation appeals and conducts case reviews. Other courts include the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_Indonesia"] Constitutional Court (Mahkamah Konstitusi) that
listens to constitutional and political matters, and the Religious Court (Pengadilan Agama) that deals with codified Islamic
Law (sharia) cases.[129] Additionally, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Commission_of_Indonesia"] Judicial Commission (Komisi Yudisial) monitors the performance of judges.[130]
Parties and elections
Since 1999, Indonesia has had a multi-party system. In all [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Indonesia"] legislative elections
since the fall of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Order_(Indonesia)"] New Order, no political party has managed to win an overall
majority of seats. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_Democratic_Party_of_Struggle"] Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), which
secured the most votes in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Indonesian_general_election"] 2019 elections, is the party of the incumbent
 president, Joko Widodo.[131] Other notable parties include the Party of the
Functional Groups (Golkar), the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Indonesia_Movement_Party"] Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra),
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(Indonesia)"] Democratic Party, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperous_Justice_Party"] Prosperous Justice Party (PKS).
The first general election was held in 1955 to elect members of the DPR and the
 Constitutional Assembly (Konstituante).  The most recent elections in 2019
resulted in nine political parties in the DPR, with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_threshold"] parliamentary threshold of

4% of the national vote.[132] At the national level, Indonesians did not elect a
president until 2004. Since then, the president is elected for a five-year term, as are the party-aligned members of the DPR
and the non-partisan DPD.[127][122] Beginning with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Indonesian_local_elections"] 2015 local elections, elections for governors and mayors have
occurred on the same date. In 2014, the Constitutional Court ruled that legislative and presidential elections would be held
simultaneously, starting in 2019.[133]
Administrative divisions
Indonesia has several levels of subdivisions. The first level is that of the provinces, which have a legislature (Dewan
Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah, DPRD) and an elected governor. A total of 34 provinces have been established from the original
eight provinces in 1945,[134] with the most recent change being the split of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Kalimantan"] North Kalimantan from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Kalimantan"] East Kalimantan in
2012.[135] The second level is that of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regency_(Indonesia)"] regencies (kabupaten) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_status_in_Indonesia"] cities (kota), led by regents (bupati) and mayors
(walikota) respectively and a legislature (DPRD Kabupaten/Kota). The third level is that of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Indonesia"] districts (kecamatan, distrik in
Papua, or kapanewon and kemantren in Yogyakarta), and the fourth is of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villages_of_Indonesia"] villages (either desa, kelurahan, kampung,
nagari in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Sumatra"] West Sumatra, or gampong in Aceh).[136]
The village is the lowest level of government administration. It is divided into several community groups (rukun warga, RW),
which are further divided into neighbourhood groups (rukun tetangga, RT). In Java, the village (desa) is divided into smaller
units called dusun or dukuh (hamlets), which are the same as RW. Following the implementation of regional autonomy
Page 8
measures in 2001, regencies and cities have become chief administrative units responsible for providing most government
services. The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen's daily life and handles village or neighbourhood
matters through an elected village head (lurah or kepala desa).[137]
Five of Indonesian provinces—Aceh, Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Papua, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Papua_(province)"] West Papua—are granted a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_administrative_division"] special autonomous status
(otonomi khusus) from the central government. A conservative [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism"] Islamic territory, Aceh has the right to create some aspects of
an independent legal system implementing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia"] sharia.[138] Jakarta is the only [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_city"] city with a provincial government due to its
position as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_of_Indonesia"] capital of Indonesia.[139][140] Yogyakarta is the only [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indonesian_monarchies"] pre-colonial monarchy legally recognised within
 Indonesia, with the positions of governor and vice governor being prioritised for the reigning Sultan of Yogyakarta and Duke
of Pakualaman, respectively.[141] Papua and West Papua are the only provinces where the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_people_of_New_Guinea"] indigenous people have privileges
in their local government.[142]

Foreign relations
Indonesia maintains 132 diplomatic missions abroad, including 95 embassies.[143]
The country adheres to what it calls a "free and active" foreign policy, seeking a role
in regional affairs in proportion to its size and location but avoiding involvement in
conflicts among other countries.[144]
Indonesia was a significant battleground during the Cold War. Numerous attempts by
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"] United States and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"] Soviet Union,[145][146] and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China"] People's Republic of China
to some degree,[147] culminated in the 1965 coup attempt and subsequent upheaval
that led to a reorientation of foreign policy.[148] Quiet alignment with the Western
world while maintaining a non-aligned stance has characterised Indonesia's foreign
policy since then.[149] Today, it maintains close relations with its neighbours and is a

observers have pointed out that Indonesia has ties with Israel, albeit discreetly.[150]
 Indonesia has been a member of the United Nations since 1950[c] and was a founding member of the Non-Aligned
 Movement (NAM) and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).[152] Indonesia is a signatory to the ASEAN Free
Trade Area agreement, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairns_Group"] Cairns Group, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"] World Trade Organization (WTO), and an occasional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC"] OPEC member.[153]
Indonesia has been a humanitarian and development aid recipient since 1966,[154][155][156] and recently, the country
established its first overseas aid program in late 2019.[157]
Military
 Indonesia's Armed Forces (TNI) include the Army (TNI–AD), Navy (TNI–AL, which includes Marine Corps), and Air

Force (TNI–AU). The army has about 400,000 active-duty personnel. Defence spending in the national budget was 0.7% of
GDP in 2018,[158] with controversial involvement of military-owned commercial interests and foundations.[159] The Armed
Forces were formed during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_National_Revolution"] Indonesian National Revolution when it undertook guerrilla warfare along with informal
militia. Since then, territorial lines have formed the basis of all TNI branches' structure, aimed at maintaining domestic
stability and deterring foreign threats.[160] The military has possessed a strong political influence since its founding, which
 peaked during the New Order. Political reforms in 1998 included the removal of the TNI's formal representation from the
legislature. Nevertheless, its political influence remains, albeit at a reduced level.[161]
Since independence, the country has struggled to maintain unity against local insurgencies and separatist movements.[162]
Some, notably in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency_in_Aceh"] Aceh and Papua, have led to an armed conflict and subsequent allegations of human rights abuses and
brutality from all sides.[163][164][165] The former was resolved peacefully in 2005,[77] while the latter has continued, amid a
significant, albeit imperfect, implementation of regional autonomy laws and a reported decline in the levels of violence and
 human rights abuses as of 2006.[166] Other engagements of the army include the campaign against the Netherlands New
 Guinea to incorporate the territory into Indonesia, the 1960s opposition to the creation of Malaysia ("Konfrontasi"), the mass
killings of Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_invasion_of_East_Timor"] invasion of East Timor, which remains Indonesia's most massive
military operation.[167][168]
Economy
Indonesia has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy"] mixed economy in which both the private sector and government
play vital roles.[170] As the only [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20"] G20 member state in Southeast Asia,[171] the
 country has the largest economy in the region and is classified as a newly
 industrialised country. Per a 2022 estimate, it is the world's 17th largest economy by
nominal GDP and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)"] 7th in terms of GDP at PPP, estimated to be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"] US$1.289 trillion and
 US$3.995 trillion, respectively. Per capita GDP in PPP is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"] US$14,535, while nominal
 per capita GDP is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"] US$4,691.[9] The debt ratio to GDP is 29.2%.[172] The services
are the economy's largest sector and account for 43.4% of GDP (2018), followed by
industry (39.7%) and agriculture (12.8%).[173] Since 2009, it has employed more
people than other sectors, accounting for 47.7% of the total labour force, followed by
agriculture (30.2%) and industry (21.9%).[174]

Over time, the structure of the economy has changed considerably.[175] Historically, oil.[169]
it has been weighted heavily towards agriculture, reflecting both its stage of economic
development and government policies in the 1950s and 1960s to promote agricultural
self-sufficiency.[175] A gradual process of industrialisation and urbanisation began in the late 1960s and accelerated in the
1980s as falling oil prices saw the government focus on diversifying away from oil exports and towards manufactured
exports.[175] This development continued throughout the 1980s and into the next decade despite the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_oil_price_shock"] 1990 oil price shock,
during which the GDP rose at an average rate of 7.1%. As a result, the official poverty rate fell from 60% to 15%.[176] Trade
 barriers reduction from the mid-1980s made the economy more globally integrated. The growth ended with the 1997 Asian
financial crisis that severely impacted the economy, including a 13.1% real GDP contraction in 1998 and a 78% inflation.
The economy reached its low point in mid-1999 with only 0.8% real GDP growth.[177]
Relatively steady inflation[178] and an increase in GDP deflator and the Consumer Price Index[179] have contributed to
strong economic growth in recent years. From 2007 to 2019, annual growth has accelerated to between 4% and 6% as a
 result of improvement in the banking sector and domestic consumption,[180] helping Indonesia weather the 2008–2009 Great

 Recession,[181] and regain in 2011 the investment grade rating it had lost
in 1997.[182] As of 2019, 9.41% of the population lived below the poverty
line, and the official open unemployment rate was 5.28%.[183] However,
in late 2020, Indonesia fell into its first recession in 22 years due to the
effects of the global [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic"] COVID-19 pandemic.[184]
Indonesia has abundant natural resources like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum"] oil and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas"] natural gas, coal, tin,

coffee, cacao, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicinal_plants"] medicinal plants, spices, and rubber. These commodities
make up a large portion of the country's exports, with palm oil and coal
briquettes as the leading export commodities. In addition to refined and
crude petroleum as the primary imports, telephones, vehicle parts and
wheat cover the majority of additional imports. China, the United States,

Indonesia's transport system has been shaped over time by the economic resource base of an archipelago, and the distribution
of its 250 million people highly concentrated on Java.[186] All transport modes play a role in the country's transport system
and are generally complementary rather than competitive. In 2016, the transport sector generated about 5.2% of GDP.[187]
The road transport system is predominant, with a total length of 542,310 kilometres (336,980 miles) as of 2018.[188] Jakarta
has the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransJakarta"] most extended bus rapid transit system globally, boasting 251.2 kilometres (156.1 miles) in 13 corridors and ten cross-
corridor routes.[189] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickshaw"] Rickshaws such as bajaj and becak and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_taxi"] share taxis such as Angkot and Metromini are a regular sight in
the country.
Most [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Indonesia"] railways are in Java, used for freight and passenger transport, such as local commuter rail services (mainly in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRL_Commuterline"] Jakarta
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KRL_Commuterline_Yogyakarta%E2%80%93Solo"] Yogyakarta–Solo) complementing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_Indonesia"] inter-city rail network in several cities. In the late 2010s, Jakarta and Palembang
were the first cities in Indonesia to have [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_transit"] rapid transit systems, with more planned for other cities in the future.[190] In 2015,
the government announced a plan to build a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail_in_Indonesia"] high-speed rail, which would be a first in Southeast Asia.[191]
 Indonesia's largest airport, Soekarno–Hatta International Airport, is among the busiest in the Southern Hemisphere, serving

and third-busiest airport, respectively. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garuda_Indonesia"] Garuda Indonesia, the country's flag carrier since 1949, is one of the world's leading
airlines and a member of the global airline alliance SkyTeam. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Tanjung_Priok"] Port of Tanjung Priok is the busiest and most advanced
Indonesian port,[192] handling more than 50% of Indonesia's trans-shipment cargo traffic.
Energy
 In 2017, Indonesia was the world's 9th largest energy producer with 4,200 terawatt-hours (14.2 quadrillion British thermal
units), and the 15th largest energy consumer, with 2,100 terawatt-hours (7.1 quadrillion British thermal units).[193] The
country has substantial energy resources, including 22 billion barrels (3.5 billion cubic metres) of conventional oil and gas
reserves (of which about 4 billion barrels are recoverable), 8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent of coal-based methane (CBM)
Page 11
resources, and 28 billion tonnes of recoverable coal.[194] While reliance on domestic
coal and imported oil has increased,[195] Indonesia has seen progress in renewable
energy, with hydropower being the most abundant source. Furthermore, the country
has the potential for geothermal, solar, wind, biomass and ocean energy.[196] As of
2019, Indonesia's total national installed power generation capacity stands at
69,678.85 MW.[197]
The country's largest dam, Jatiluhur, has several purposes, including the provision of
hydroelectric power generation, water supply, flood control, irrigation and
aquaculture. The earth-fill dam is 105 m (344 ft) high and withholds a reservoir of
3.0 billion m3 (2.4 million acre⋅ft). It helps to supply water to Jakarta and to irrigate
240,000 ha (590,000 acres) of rice fields[198] and has an installed capacity of 186.5
MW which feeds into the Java grid managed by the State Electricity Company

Science and technology
Government expenditure on research and development is relatively low (0.3% of
GDP in 2019)[199] and Indonesia only ranked 87th (out of 132 economies) on the
2021 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Innovation_Index"] Global Innovation Index report.[200] Historical examples of scientific and
technological developments include the paddy cultivation technique [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrace_(agriculture)"] terasering,
 which is common in Southeast Asia, and the pinisi boats by the Bugis and Makassar
people.[201] In the 1980s, Indonesian engineer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tjokorda_Raka_Sukawati"] Tjokorda Raka Sukawati invented aroad construction technique named [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosrobahu"] Sosrobahu that allows the construction of long
stretches of flyovers above existing main roads with minimum traffic disruption. It
later became widely used in several countries.[202] The country is also an active
producer of passenger trains and freight wagons with its state-owned company, the
 Indonesian Railway Industry (INKA), and has exported trains abroad.[203] 
 Palapa satellite launch in 1984
Indonesia has a long history of developing military and small commuter aircraft. It is
the only country in Southeast Asia to build and produce aircraft. The state-owned
 Indonesian Aerospace company (PT. Dirgantara Indonesia) has provided components for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing"] Boeing and Airbus.[204] The
company also collaborated with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EADS_CASA"] EADS CASA of Spain to develop the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA/IPTN_CN-235"] CN-235, which has seen use by several
 countries.[205] Former President B. J. Habibie played a vital role in this achievement.[206] Indonesia has also joined the South
Korean programme to manufacture the 4.5-generation jet fighter [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KAI_KF-21_Boramae"] KAI KF-21 Boramae.[207]
Indonesia has a space programme and space agency, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Aeronautics_and_Space"] National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (Lembaga Penerbangan
dan Antariksa Nasional, LAPAN). In the 1970s, Indonesia became the first developing country to operate a satellite system
called Palapa,[208] a series of communication satellites owned by Indosat. The first satellite, PALAPA A1, was launched on 8
July 1976 from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center"] Kennedy Space Center in Florida, United States.[209] As of 2019, Indonesia has launched 18 satellites for
various purposes.[210]
Tourism 
 Tourism contributed around [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"] US$19.7 billion to GDP in 2019. In 2018,
Indonesia received 15.8 million visitors, a growth of 12.5% from last year, and
received an average receipt of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"] US$967.[212][213] China, Singapore, Malaysia,

Nature and culture are prime attractions of Indonesian tourism. The former can
boast a unique combination of a tropical climate, a vast archipelago, and a long
stretch of beaches, and the latter complement those with a rich cultural heritage
reflecting Indonesia's dynamic history and ethnic diversity. Indonesia has a well-
preserved natural ecosystem with rain forests that stretch over about 57% of Indonesia's land (225 million acres). Forests on
Sumatra and Kalimantan are examples of popular destinations, such as the Orangutan wildlife reserve. Moreover, Indonesia

has one of the world's longest coastlines, measuring 54,716 kilometres (33,999 mi).
The ancient [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borobudur"] Borobudur and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prambanan"] Prambanan temples, as well as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toraja"] Toraja and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali"] Bali with their
traditional festivities, are some of the popular destinations for cultural tourism.[217]
 Indonesia has nine UNESCO World Heritage Sites, including the Komodo National
Park and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ombilin_Coal_Mine"] Sawahlunto Coal Mine; and a further 19 in a tentative list that includes
 Bunaken National Park and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raja_Ampat_Islands"] Raja Ampat Islands.[218] Other attractions include the
specific points in Indonesian history, such as the colonial heritage of the Dutch East

 The 2020 census recorded Indonesia's population as 270.2 million, the fourth largest
in the world, with a moderately high population growth rate of 1.25%.[219] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java"] Java is
the world's most populous island,[220] where 56% of the country's population lives.[8]
The population density is 141 people per km2 (365 per sq mi),[8] ranking 88th in the
world, although Java has a population density of 1,067 people per km2 (2,435 per sq
mi). In 1961, the first post-colonial census recorded a total of 97 million people.[221]
It is expected to grow to around 295 million by 2030 and 321 million by 2050.[222]
The country currently possesses a relatively young population, with a median age of
30.2 years (2017 estimate).[80]

Ethnic groups and languages
Indonesia is an ethnically diverse country, with around 1,300 distinct native ethnic groups.[4] Most Indonesians are descended
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_peoples"] Austronesian peoples whose languages had origins in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Austronesian_language"] Proto-Austronesian, which possibly originated in what is now
 Taiwan. Another major grouping is the Melanesians, who inhabit eastern Indonesia (the Maluku Islands and Western New
Guinea).[25][227][228]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraton_Ngayogyakarta_Hadiningrat"]
Page 13
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_people"] Javanese are the largest ethnic group, constituting 40.2% of the
population,[4] and are politically dominant.[229] They are
predominantly located in the central to eastern parts of Java and also
sizeable numbers in most provinces. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundanese_people"] Sundanese are the next
largest group (15.4%),  followed by Batak, Madurese, Betawi,
Minangkabau, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugis_people"] Buginese and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_Indonesians"] Malay people.[d] A sense of
Indonesian nationhood exists alongside strong regional
identities.[230] 
A map of ethnic groups in Indonesia
The country's official language is Indonesian, a variant of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_language"] Malay
based on its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestige_(sociolinguistics)"] prestige dialect, which had been the archipelago's
 lingua franca for centuries. It was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Pledge"] promoted by nationalists in the 1920s and achieved official status in 1945 under the name
Bahasa Indonesia.[231] As a result of centuries-long contact with other languages, it is rich in local and foreign influences,
including Javanese, Sundanese, Minangkabau, Makassarese, Hindustani, Sanskrit, Tamil, Chinese, Arabic, Dutch,
Portuguese and English.[232][233][234] Nearly every Indonesian speaks the language due to its widespread use in education,
academics, communications, business, politics, and mass media. Most Indonesians also speak at least one of more than 700
 local languages,[3] often as their first language. Most belong to the Austronesian language family, while over 270 Papuan
languages are spoken in eastern Indonesia.[3] Of these, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_language"] Javanese is the most widely spoken[80] and has co-official status in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Region_of_Yogyakarta"] Special Region of Yogyakarta.[235]
In 1930, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_people"] Dutch and other Europeans ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totok"] Totok), Eurasians, and derivative people like the Indos, numbered 240,000 or 0.4% of
the total population.[236] Historically, they constituted only a tiny fraction of the native population and remain so today. Also,
the Dutch language never had a substantial number of speakers or official status despite the Dutch presence for almost 350
years.[237] The small minorities that can speak it or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch-based_creole_languages"] Dutch-based creole languages fluently are the aforementioned ethnic
groups and descendants of Dutch colonisers. This reflected the Dutch colonial empire's primary purpose, which was
commercial exchange as opposed to sovereignty over homogeneous landmasses.[238] Today, there is some degree of fluency
by either educated members of the oldest generation or legal professionals,[239] as specific law codes are still only available in
Dutch.[240]
Religion
Despite guaranteeing religious freedom in the constitution,[241][126] the government officially recognises only [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Indonesia"] six religions:
Islam, Protestantism, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_Indonesia"] Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism;[242][243] with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_religions"] indigenous religions only
partly acknowledged.[243] With 231 million adherents (86.7%) in 2018, Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim-
majority country,[244][245] with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam"] Sunnis being the majority (99%).[246] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam_in_Indonesia"] Shias and Ahmadis, respectively, constitute 1%
(1–3 million) and 0.2% (200,000–400,000) of Muslims.[243][247] Almost 11% of Indonesians are Christians, while the rest
are Hindus, Buddhists, and others. Most [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu"] Hindus are Balinese,[248] and most [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism"] Buddhists are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Indonesians"] Chinese Indonesians.[249]
The natives of the Indonesian archipelago originally practised indigenous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism"] animism
and dynamism, beliefs that are common to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_people"] Austronesian people.[250] They
worshipped and revered ancestral spirit and believed that supernatural spirits ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyang"] hyang)
might inhabit certain places such as large trees, stones, forests, mountains, or sacred
 sites.[250] Examples of Indonesian native belief systems include the Sundanese Sunda
Wiwitan, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayak_people"] Dayak's Kaharingan, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_people"] Javanese Kejawèn. They have had a
significant impact on how other faiths are practised, evidenced by a large proportion
of people—such as the Javanese abangan, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_Hinduism"] Balinese Hindus, and Dayak Christians—

province where [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_Hinduism"] Hinduism is the

 Hindu influences reached the archipelago as early as the first century CE.[252] The
 Sundanese [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdoms_of_Sunda"] Kingdom of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salakanagara"] Salakanagara in western Java around 130 was the first
historically recorded [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_India"] Indianised kingdom in the archipelago.[253] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_Indonesia"] Buddhism arrived
around the 6th century,[254] and its history in Indonesia is closely related to that of
Hinduism, as some empires based on Buddhism had their roots around the same period. The archipelago has witnessed the
rise and fall of powerful and influential Hindu and Buddhist empires such as Majapahit, Sailendra, Srivijaya, and Mataram.
Though no longer a majority, Hinduism and Buddhism remain to have a substantial influence on Indonesian culture.[255][256]
 Islam was introduced by Sunni traders of the Shafi'i school as well as Sufi traders from the Indian subcontinent and southern
Arabia as early as the 8th century CE.[257][258] For the most part, Islam overlaid and mixed with existing cultural and
religious influences that resulted in a distinct form of Islam ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesantren"] pesantren).[34][259] Trade, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_missionary_activity"] Islamic missionary activity such as by

century, it had supplanted Hinduism and Buddhism as the dominant religion of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java#Religion"] Java
and Sumatra.

 Catholicism was brought by Portuguese
 traders and missionaries such as Jesuit Francis
Xavier, who visited and baptised several
thousand locals.[262][263] Its spread faced
difficulty due to the Dutch East India [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baiturrahman_Grand_Mosque"] Baiturrahman Grand Mosque in

 Protestantism is mostly a result of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvinism"] Calvinist
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutheranism"] Lutheran missionary efforts during the
Dutch colonial era.[264][265][266] Although they are the most common branch, there
is a multitude of other denominations elsewhere in the country.[267]
There was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Indonesia"] sizeable Jewish presence in the archipelago until 1945, mostly Dutch and some Baghdadi Jews. Since most left
after Indonesia proclaimed independence, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism"] Judaism was never accorded official status, and only a tiny number of Jews remain
today, mostly in Jakarta and Surabaya.[268]
At the national and local level, Indonesia's political leadership and civil society groups have played a crucial role in interfaith
relations, both positively and negatively. The invocation of the first principle of Indonesia's philosophical foundation,
Pancasila (the belief in the one and only God), often serves as a reminder of religious tolerance,[269] though instances of
intolerance have occurred.[75][76] An overwhelming majority of Indonesians consider religion to be essential and an integral
part of life.[270][271]
Education and health
Education is compulsory for 12 years.[272] Parents can choose between state-run,
non-sectarian schools or private or semi-private religious (usually Islamic) schools,
supervised by the ministries of Education and Religion, respectively.[273] Private
international schools that do not follow the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Indonesia#2013_curriculum"] national curriculum are also available. The
enrolment rate is 93% for primary education, 79% for secondary education, and 36%
for tertiary education (2018).[274] The literacy rate is 96% (2018),  and the
government spends about 3.6% of GDP (2015) on education.[274] In 2018, there
were 4,670 higher educational institutions in Indonesia, with most of them (74%)
 being located in Sumatra and Java.[275][276] According to the QS World University
 Rankings, Indonesia's top universities are the University of Indonesia, Gadjah Mada
University and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandung_Institute_of_Technology"] Bandung Institute of Technology.[277] 
 Bandung Institute of Technology in
West Java
Government expenditure on healthcare is about 3.3% of GDP in 2016.[278] As part of an attempt to achieve universal health
care, the government launched the National Health Insurance (Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional, JKN) in 2014.[279] It includes
coverage for a range of services from the public and also private firms that have opted to join the scheme. Despite remarkable
improvements in recent decades such as rising life expectancy (from 62.3 years in 1990 to 71.7 years in 2019)[280] and
declining child mortality (from 84 deaths per 1,000 births in 1990 to 23.9 deaths in 2019),[281] challenges remain, including
maternal and child health, low air quality, malnutrition, high rate of smoking, and infectious diseases.[282]
Issues
In the economic sphere, there is a gap in wealth, unemployment rate, and health between densely populated islands and
economic centres (such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatra"] Sumatra and Java) and sparsely populated, disadvantaged areas (such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maluku_Islands"] Maluku and
Papua).[283][284] This is created by a situation in which nearly 80% of Indonesia's population lives in the western parts of the
archipelago,[285] and yet growing at a slower pace than the rest of the country.
Page 15
 In the social arena, numerous cases of racism and discrimination, especially against
Chinese Indonesians and Papuans, have been well documented throughout
Indonesia's history.[286][287] Such cases have sometimes led to violent conflicts, most
notably the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1998_riots_of_Indonesia"] May 1998 riots and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_conflict"] Papua conflict, which has continued since 1962.
LGBT people also regularly face challenges. Although [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Indonesia"] LGBT issues have been
relatively obscure, the 2010s (especially after 2016) has seen a rapid surge of anti-
LGBT rhetoric, putting LGBT Indonesians into a frequent subject of intimidation,
discrimination, and even violence.[288][289] In addition, Indonesia has been reported
to have sizeable numbers of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labor"] child and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_labour"] forced labourers, with the former being
prevalent in the palm oil and tobacco industries, while the latter in the fishing
industry.[290][291] 
Riots on the streets of Jakarta on 14

Culture
The cultural history of the Indonesian archipelago spans more than two millennia. Influences from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent"] Indian subcontinent,
 mainland China, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East"] Middle East, Europe,[292][293] and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austronesian_peoples"] Austronesian peoples have historically shaped the cultural,
linguistic and religious makeup of the archipelago. As a result, modern-day Indonesia has a multicultural, multilingual and
multi-ethnic society,[3][4] with a complex cultural mixture that differs significantly from the original indigenous cultures.
Indonesia currently holds [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_Intangible_Cultural_Heritage_Lists"] twelve items of UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage, including a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayang"] wayang puppet theatre, kris,
batik,[294] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencak_silat"] pencak silat, angklung, gamelan, and the three genres of traditional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_dance"] Balinese dance.[295]
Art and architecture 
Indonesian arts include both age-old art forms developed through centuries and
recently developed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_art"] contemporary art. Despite often displaying local ingenuity,
 Indonesian arts have absorbed foreign influences—most notably from India, the Arab
world, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"] China and Europe, due to contacts and interactions facilitated, and often
motivated, by trade.[296] Painting is an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_art"] established and developed art in Bali, where
its people are famed for their artistry. Their painting tradition started as classical
 Kamasan or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayang"] Wayang style visual narrative, derived from visual art discovered on
 candi bas reliefs in eastern Java.[297]
Traditional Balinese painting
depicting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockfighting"] cockfighting There have been numerous discoveries of
 megalithic sculptures in Indonesia.[298]
Subsequently, tribal art has flourished within
the culture of Nias, Batak, Asmat, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayak_people"] Dayak and Toraja.[299][300] Wood and stone are
common materials used as the media for sculpting among these tribes. Between the
8th and 15th centuries, the Javanese civilisation has developed a refined stone
sculpting art and architecture influenced by Hindu-Buddhist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma"] Dharmic civilisation.
The temples of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borobudur"] Borobudur and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prambanan"] Prambanan are among the most famous examples of
the practice.[301] 
An avenue of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongkonan"] Tongkonan houses in a
 Torajan village, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sulawesi"] South Sulawesi
As with the arts, Indonesian architecture has absorbed foreign influences that have
brought cultural changes and profound effect on building styles and techniques. The
most dominant has traditionally been Indian; however, Chinese, Arab, and European influences have also been significant.
Traditional carpentry, masonry, stone and woodwork techniques and decorations have thrived in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernacular_architecture"] vernacular architecture, with
numbers of traditional houses' ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumah_adat"] rumah adat) styles that have been developed. The traditional houses and settlements vary by
ethnic groups, and each has a specific custom and history.[302] Examples include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toraja"] Toraja's Tongkonan, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minangkabau_people"] Minangkabau's
 Rumah Gadang and Rangkiang, Javanese style Pendopo pavilion with Joglo style roof, Dayak's longhouses, various Malay
houses, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_architecture"] Balinese houses and temples, and also different forms of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_barn"] rice barns (lumbung).
Music, dance and clothing
The music of Indonesia predates historical records. Various indigenous tribes incorporate chants and songs accompanied by
musical instruments in their rituals. Angklung, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kacapi_suling"] kacapi suling, gong, gamelan, talempong, kulintang, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasando"] sasando are examples
of traditional Indonesian instruments. The diverse world of Indonesian music genres results from the musical creativity of its
people and subsequent cultural encounters with foreign influences. These include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qanb%C5%ABs"] gambus and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasida"] qasida from the Middle
East,[303] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keroncong"] keroncong from Portugal,[304] and dangdut—one of Indonesia's most popular music genres—with notable Hindi

influence as well as Malay orchestras.[305] Today, the Indonesian music industry enjoys both nationwide and regional
popularity in Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei,[306][307] due to the common culture and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Indonesian_and_Standard_Malay"] mutual intelligibility between
 Indonesian and Malay.[308]
Indonesian dances have a diverse history, with more than 3,000 original dances. Scholars
believe that they had their beginning in rituals and religious worship.[309] Examples include
war dances, a dance of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_doctor"] witch doctors, and dance to call for rain or any agricultural rituals
such as Hudoq. Indonesian dances derive their influences from the archipelago's prehistoric
and tribal, Hindu-Buddhist, and Islamic periods. Recently, modern dances and urban teen
dances have gained popularity due to the influence of Western culture and those of Japan and
South Korea to some extent. However, various traditional dances, including those of Java,
Bali and Dayak, continue to be a living and dynamic tradition.[310]
Indonesia has various styles of clothing as a result of its long and rich cultural history. The
national costume has its origins in the indigenous culture of the country and traditional textile
traditions. The Javanese [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batik"] Batik and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kebaya"] Kebaya[311] are arguably Indonesia's most recognised
national costume, though they have [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundanese_people"] Sundanese and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_people"] Balinese origins as well.[312] Each
province has a representation of traditional attire and dress,[292] such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulos"] Ulos of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batak"] Batak from
 North Sumatra; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songket"] Songket of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malays_(ethnic_group)"] Malay and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minangkabau_people"] Minangkabau from Sumatra; and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikat"] Ikat of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasak_people"] Sasak from
Lombok. People wear national and regional costumes during traditional weddings, formal
ceremonies, music performances, government and official occasions,[312] and they vary from
traditional to modern attire.

Theatre and cinema 
Wayang, the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_puppet"] shadow puppet theatre display
several mythological legends such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana"] Ramayana and Mahabharata.[313] Other forms
of local drama include the Javanese [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludruk"] Ludruk and Ketoprak, the Sundanese Sandiwara,
Betawi Lenong,[314][315] and various Balinese dance drama. They incorporate
humour and jest and often involve audiences in their performances.[316] Some theatre
traditions also include music, dancing and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencak_Silat"] silat martial art, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randai"] Randai from
 Pandava and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna"] Krishna in an act of the
Wayang Wong performance 
 Minangkabau people of West Sumatra. It is usually performed for traditional
ceremonies and festivals,[317][318] and based on semi-historical Minangkabau
legends and love story.[318] Modern performing art also developed in Indonesia with
its distinct style of drama. Notable theatre, dance, and drama troupe such as Teater
Koma are famous as it often portrays social and political satire of Indonesian society.[319]
The first film produced in the archipelago was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loetoeng_Kasaroeng"] Loetoeng Kasaroeng,[320] a silent film by Dutch director L. Heuveldorp. The
film industry expanded after independence, with six films made in 1949 rising to 58 in 1955. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usmar_Ismail"] Usmar Ismail, who made
 significant imprints in the 1950s and 1960s, is generally considered the pioneer of Indonesian films.[321] The latter part of the
Sukarno era saw the use of cinema for nationalistic, anti-Western purposes, and foreign films were subsequently banned,
while the New Order utilised a censorship code that aimed to maintain social order.[322] Production of films peaked during
Page 17
the 1980s, although it declined significantly in the next decade.[320] Notable films in this
 period include Pengabdi Setan (1980), Nagabonar (1987), Tjoet Nja' Dhien (1988), Catatan
Si Boy (1989), and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warkop"] Warkop's comedy films.
 Independent filmmaking was a rebirth of the film industry since 1998, where films started
addressing previously banned topics, such as religion, race, and love.[322] Between 2000 and
 2005, the number of films released each year steadily increased.[323] Riri Riza and Mira
Lesmana were among the new generation of filmmakers who co-directed Kuldesak (1999),
 Petualangan Sherina (2000), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Apa_dengan_Cinta%3F"] Ada Apa dengan Cinta? (2002), and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laskar_Pelangi"] Laskar Pelangi (2008). In
2016, Warkop DKI Reborn: Jangkrik Boss Part 1 smashed box office records, becoming the
most-watched Indonesian film with 6.8 million tickets sold.[324] Indonesia has held annual
film festivals and awards, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_Film_Festival"] Indonesian Film Festival (Festival Film Indonesia)
held intermittently since 1955. It hands out the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citra_Award"] Citra Award, the film industry's most
prestigious award. From 1973 to 1992, the festival was held annually and then discontinued
until its revival in 2004.
Mass media and literature 
 Advertisement for Loetoeng
Kasaroeng (1926), the first
fiction film produced in the
Dutch East Indies
 Media freedom increased considerably after the fall of the New Order, during which
the Ministry of Information monitored and controlled domestic media and restricted
foreign media.[325] The television market includes several national commercial
networks and provincial networks that compete with public TVRI, which held a
monopoly on TV broadcasting from 1962 to 1989. By the early 21st century, the
improved communications system had brought television signals to every village, and
people can choose from up to 11 channels.[326] Private radio stations carry news
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelora_Bung_Karno_Stadium"] Metro TV at Gelora Bung Karno
 Stadium, reporting the 2010 AFF 
bulletins while foreign broadcasters supply programmes. The number of printed
publications has increased significantly since 1998.[326]
Championship Like other developing countries, Indonesia began developing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"] Internet in the early
1990s. Its first commercial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider"] Internet service provider, PT. Indo Internet began
operation in Jakarta in 1994.[327] The country had 171 million Internet users in 2018,
with a penetration rate that keeps increasing annually.[328] Most are between the ages of 15 and 19 and depend primarily on
mobile phones for access, outnumbering laptops and computers.[329]
The oldest evidence of writing in the Indonesian archipelago is a series of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit"] Sanskrit
 inscriptions dated to the 5th century. Many of Indonesia's peoples have firmly rooted oral
traditions, which help define and preserve their cultural identities.[331] In written poetry and
prose, several traditional forms dominate, mainly syair, pantun, gurindam, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Hikayat"] hikayat and babad.
Examples of these forms include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syair_Abdul_Muluk"] Syair Abdul Muluk, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikayat_Hang_Tuah"] Hikayat Hang Tuah, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_Annals"] Sulalatus Salatin,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babad_Tanah_Jawi"] Babad Tanah Jawi.[332]
Early modern Indonesian literature originates in the Sumatran tradition.[333][334] Literature
 and poetry flourished during the decades leading up to and after independence. Balai
Pustaka, the government bureau for popular literature, was instituted in 1917 to promote the
development of indigenous literature. Many scholars consider the 1950s and 1960s to be the
Golden Age of Indonesian Literature.[335] The style and characteristics of modern Indonesian
literature vary according to the dynamics of the country's political and social landscape,[335]
most notably the war of independence in the second half of the 1940s and the anti-communist
mass killings in the mid-1960s.[336] Notable literary figures of the modern era include
 Multatuli, Chairil Anwar, Mohammad Yamin, Merari Siregar, Marah Roesli, Pramoedya
Ananta Toer, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayu_Utami"] Ayu Utami.
Cuisine 
 Pramoedya Ananta Toer,
Indonesia's most famous
novelist. Many considered
him to be Southeast Asia's
leading candidate for a
 Nobel Prize in
Literature.[330]
Indonesian cuisine is one of the world's most diverse, vibrant, and colourful, full of intense flavour.[337] Many regional
cuisines exist, often based upon indigenous culture and foreign influences such as Chinese, European, Middle Eastern, and
Indian precedents.[338] Rice is the leading [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staple_food"] staple food and is served with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_dish"] side dishes of meat and vegetables. Spices (notably
chilli), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_milk"] coconut milk, fish and chicken are fundamental ingredients.[339]
Page 18
Some popular dishes such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasi_goreng"] nasi goreng, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gado-gado"] gado-gado, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satay"] sate, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soto_(food)"] soto are ubiquitous
and considered national dishes. The Ministry of Tourism, however, chose [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumpeng"] tumpeng as
the official national dish in 2014, describing it as binding the diversity of various
culinary traditions.[340] Other popular dishes include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendang"] rendang,  one of the many
 Padang cuisines along with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendeng"] dendeng and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulai"] gulai. Another fermented food is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncom"] oncom,
similar in some ways to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempeh"] tempeh but uses a variety of bases (not only soy), created by
different fungi, and is prevalent in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Java"] West Java.[341]

Sports
Sports are generally male-oriented, and spectators are often associated with illegal
gambling.[342] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton"] Badminton and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football"] football are the most popular sports. Indonesia is among the
only five countries that have won the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cup"] Thomas and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber_Cup"] Uber Cup, the world team championship
of men's and women's badminton. Along with weightlifting, it is the sport that contributes the
most to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia_at_the_Olympics"] Indonesia's Olympic medal tally. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liga_1_(Indonesia)"] Liga 1 is the country's premier football club league.
 On the international stage, Indonesia was the first Asian team to participate in the FIFA
World Cup in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_FIFA_World_Cup"] 1938 as the Dutch East Indies.[343] On a regional level, Indonesia won a
 bronze medal at the 1958 Asian Games as well as two gold medals at the 1987 and 1991
Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games). Indonesia's first appearance at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Asian_Cup"] AFC Asian Cup
was in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_AFC_Asian_Cup"] 1996 and successfully qualified for the next three tournaments, although they never
make the knockout phase.[344]
Other popular sports include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing"] boxing and basketball, which has a long history in Indonesia
and was part of the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Sports_Week_(Indonesia)"] National Games (Pekan Olahraga Nasional, PON) in 1948.[345] 
 A demonstration of Pencak
Silat, a form of martial arts
 Sepak takraw and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karapan_sapi"] karapan sapi (bull racing) in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madura_Island"] Madura are some examples of Indonesia's
traditional sports. In areas with a history of tribal warfare, mock fighting contests are held, such as caci in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flores"] Flores and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasola"] pasola
in Sumba. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pencak_Silat"] Pencak Silat is an Indonesian martial art and, in 1987, became one of the sporting events in the SEA Games, with
Indonesia appearing as one of the leading competitors. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia is one of the top sports powerhouses by
topping the SEA Games medal table ten times since 1977,[346] most recently in 2011.[347]
