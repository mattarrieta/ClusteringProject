India,  officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat
Gaṇarājya),[26] is a country in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"] South Asia. It is the
 seventh-largest country by area, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population"] second-most populous
country, and the most populous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy"] democracy in the world.
 Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian
Sea on the southwest, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal"] Bay of Bengal on the

 Bangladesh and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar"] Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean,
India is in the vicinity of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka"] Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its
 Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border
with Thailand, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar"] Myanmar and Indonesia.
 Modern humans arrived on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_subcontinent"] Indian subcontinent from
Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[27][28][29]Their
long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as
hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse,
second only to Africa in human [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"] genetic diversity.[30]
 Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western
margins of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_River"] Indus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_basin"] river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving
gradually into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilisation"] Indus Valley Civilisation of the third

emerged within Hinduism,[36]and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Buddhism_in_India"] Buddhism and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Jainism"] Jainism
had arisen, proclaiming [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_order"] social orders unlinked to
heredity.[37]Early political consolidations gave rise to the
 loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges
Basin.[38]Their collective [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era"] era was suffused with wide-
ranging creativity,[39] but also marked by the declining
status of women,[40] and the incorporation of
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untouchability"] untouchability into an organised system of belief.[g][41] In

the British East India Company followed, turning India
into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its
sovereignty.[50] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj"] British Crown rule began in 1858. The
rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[51][52] but
 technological changes were introduced, and ideas of
education, modernity and the public life took root.[53] A
pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged,
which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the
major factor in ending British rule.[54][55] In 1947 the
British Indian Empire was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India"] partitioned into two independent
 dominions,[56][57][58][59] a Hindu-majority Dominion of
India and a Muslim-majority [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_Pakistan"] Dominion of Pakistan, amid
large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[60]
India has been a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_republic"] federal republic since 1950, governed in a
democratic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system"] parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic,
 multilingual and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism"] multi-ethnic society. India's population
grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1.211 billion in 2011.[61]
During the same time, its nominal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_capita_income"] per capita income
increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its
literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%.  From being a

Etymology
According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary"] Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name "India" is derived from the
 Classical Latin India, a reference to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"] South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived
successively from: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_Greek"] Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία); [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek"] ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός); [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Persian"] Old Persian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindush"] Hindush, an
eastern province of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_empire"] Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its cognate, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit"] Sanskrit Sindhu, or "river,"
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.in#Internationalised_domain_names_and_country_codes"]
Page 4
specifically the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_River"] Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[72][73] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece"] ancient Greeks
 referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί (https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/langcodes_name.php?c
ode_ID=)), which translates as "The people of the Indus".[74]
The term [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_India#Bh%C4%81rata"] Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Hindi_and_Urdu"] [ˈbʱaːɾət] (  listen)), mentioned in both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_epic_poetry"] Indian epic poetry and the
 Constitution of India,[75][76] is used in its variations by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_India_in_its_official_languages"] many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the
historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_India"] North India,[77][78] Bharat gained increased
currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[75][79]
 Hindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] (  listen)) is a Middle Persian name for India, introduced during the Mughal
Empire and used widely since. Its meaning has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day
northern India and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan"] Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.[75][79][80]
History
Ancient India
By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens"] Homo sapiens,
had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had
earlier evolved.[27][28][29] The earliest known modern human
remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[27] After
6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals,
construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural
surplus appeared in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehrgarh"] Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now
 Balochistan, Pakistan.[82] These gradually developed into the Indus
Valley Civilisation,[83][82] the first urban culture in South Asia,[84]
which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan
and western India.[85] Centred around cities such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohenjo-daro"] Mohenjo-daro, 
An illustration from an early-modern
manuscript of the Sanskrit epic
Ramayana, composed in story-telling
fashion c. 400 BCE – c. 300 CE.[81]
Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms
of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[84]
During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcolithic"] Chalcolithic
cultures to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age"] Iron Age ones.[86] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[87] were
 composed during this period,[88] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab
region and the upper [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Gangetic_Plain"] Gangetic Plain.[86] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed
several waves of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Aryan_migration"] Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[87] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system"] caste system,
which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by
labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[89] On the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Plateau"] Deccan Plateau, archaeological
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"] evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[86] In South
India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalith"] megalithic monuments dating from
this period,[90] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation_tanks"] irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[90]
In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain
and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known
as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahajanapadas"] mahajanapadas.[91][92] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two
of which became independent religions. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"] Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar,
Mahavira.[93] Buddhism, based on the teachings of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha"] Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social
classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of
recorded history in India.[94][95][96] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up
 renunciation as an ideal,[97] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd
Page 5
century BCE, the kingdom of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magadha"] Magadha had annexed or reduced
other states to emerge as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurya_Empire"] Mauryan Empire.[98] The empire was
once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the
far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been
separated by large autonomous areas.[99][100] The Mauryan kings
are known as much for their empire-building and determined
management of public life as for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka"] Ashoka's renunciation of
militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist
 dhamma.[101][102]  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajanta_Caves"] Cave 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta
Caves
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangam_literature"] Sangam literature of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language"] Tamil language reveals that, between
200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the
Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Roman_trade"] traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with
 West and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"] South-East Asia.[103][104] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family,
leading to increased subordination of women.[105][98] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gupta_Empire"] Gupta Empire had
created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a
model for later Indian kingdoms.[106][107] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion,
rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[108] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of
 sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[107] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_literature#Classical_Sanskrit_literature"] Classical Sanskrit literature
flowered as well, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_science_and_technology_in_the_Indian_subcontinent"] Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_mathematics"] mathematics made significant
advances.[107]
Medieval India 
The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to
1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and
cultural diversity.[109] When [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harsha"] Harsha of Kannauj,
who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606
to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was
defeated by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalukya_dynasty"] Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[110]
When his successor attempted to expand eastwards,
he was defeated by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pala_Empire"] Pala king of Bengal.[110]
When the Chalukyas attempted to expand
southwards, they were defeated by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallava_dynasty"] Pallavas from
 Brihadeshwara temple,
Thanjavur, completed in
1010 CE 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qutub_Minar"] Qutub Minar, 73 m
(240 ft) tall, completed by
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_of_Delhi"] Sultan of Delhi,
 Iltutmish 
farther south, who in turn were opposed by the
 Pandyas and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chola_dynasty"] Cholas from still farther south.[110]
No ruler of this period was able to create an empire
and consistently control lands much beyond their
core region.[109] During this time, pastoral peoples,
whose land had been cleared to make way for the
growing agricultural economy, were accommodated
within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[111] The caste system consequently began
to show regional differences.[111]
In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti"] devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[112] They were
 imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern
languages of the subcontinent.[112] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew
citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[113] Temple towns of
various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[113] By the 8th and 9th
centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were
Page 6
exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam,
Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[114] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved
in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian
seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[114]
After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courser_(horse)"] swift-horse cavalry and raising vast
armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading
eventually to the establishment of the Islamic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate"] Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[115] The sultanate was to control
much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian
elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and
customs.[116][117] By repeatedly repulsing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire"] Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India
from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration"] migration of fleeing
soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby
creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[118][119] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the
regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayanagara_Empire"] Vijayanagara Empire.[120] Embracing
a strong [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaivism"] Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to
control much of peninsular India,[121] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[120]
Early modern India
In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[122] fell again to the superior
mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[123] The resulting Mughal Empire
did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new
administrative practices[124][125] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[126] leading to more systematic,
centralised, and uniform rule.[127] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the
Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an
emperor who had near-divine status.[126] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues
from agriculture[128] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[129] caused
peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[127] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much
of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[127] resulting in greater patronage of
painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[130] Newly coherent social groups in northern and
western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions
during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military
experience.[131] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and
political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[131] As the empire disintegrated, many among
these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[132]
By the early 18th century, with the lines
between commercial and political dominance
being increasingly blurred, a number of
European trading companies, including the
English [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company"] East India Company, had established
coastal outposts.[133][134] The East India
Company's  control of the seas, greater
resources, and more advanced military training
and technology led it to increasingly assert its
military strength and caused it to become

attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these
factors were crucial in allowing the company
to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European
Page 7
companies.[135][133][136][137] Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased
strength and size of its army enabled it to annexe or subdue most of India by the 1820s.[138] India was then
no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was instead supplying the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire"] British Empire with
raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of India's colonial period.[133] By this time,
with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an
arm of British administration, the company began more consciously to enter non-economic arenas,
including education, social reform and culture.[139]
Modern India
Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment
in 1848 of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Broun-Ramsay,_1st_Marquess_of_Dalhousie"] Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes
essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the
surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them,
railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in
Europe.[140][141][142][143] However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857"] Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive British-style
social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion
rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[144][145]
Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the
 direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_state"] unitary state and a gradual but
limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a
feudal safeguard against future unrest.[146][147] In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all
over India, leading eventually to the founding of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress"] Indian National Congress in 1885.[148][149][150][151]
The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was
marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away
markets.[152] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[153] and, despite the risks of
infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for
Indians.[154] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled
Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[155] The railway network provided
critical famine relief,[156] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[156] and helped nascent Indian-owned
industry.[155] 
After World War I, in which approximately
 one million Indians served,[157] a new period
began. It was marked by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montagu%E2%80%93Chelmsford_Reforms"] British reforms but
also [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowlatt_act"] repressive legislation, by more strident
Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings
of a  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent"] nonviolent movement of non-co-
 operation, of which Mohandas Karamchand

Gandhi would become the leader and enduring
symbol.[158] During the 1930s, slow
legislative reform was enacted by the British;
the Indian National Congress won victories in
the resulting elections.[159] The next decade
 was beset with crises: Indian participation in
World War II, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All
were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India"] partition of India into two states:
India and Pakistan.[160]
Page 8
Vital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in
place a secular and democratic republic.[161] It has remained a democracy with civil liberties, an active
supreme court, and a largely independent press.[162] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1990s,
 has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into one of the world's fastest-growing
economies,[163] and increased its geopolitical clout. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an
increasing role in global culture.[162] Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural
and urban;[162] by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_violence_in_India"] religious and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste-related_violence_in_India"] caste-related violence;[164] by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naxalite"] Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[165]

with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93India_relations#1960s"] China[167] and with Pakistan.[167] India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the
world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its
disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved.[168]
Geography
India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Plate"] Indian tectonic plate, a part of the
 Indo-Australian Plate.[169] India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the
Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics"] drift caused by
 seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.[169] Simultaneously, the vast [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_Ocean"] Tethyan
 oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction"] subduct under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Plate"] Eurasian Plate.[169] These dual processes, driven
by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust"] continental crust
eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas.[169] Immediately south of the emerging
Himalayas, plate movement created a vast crescent-shaped [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trough_(geology)"] trough that rapidly filled with river-borne
sediment[170] and now constitutes the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Gangetic_Plain"] Indo-Gangetic Plain.[171] The original Indian plate makes its first
appearance above the sediment in the ancient [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aravalli_range"] Aravalli range, which extends from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Ridge"] Delhi Ridge in a
southwesterly direction. To the west lies the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thar_desert"] Thar desert, the eastern spread of which is checked by the
Aravallis.[172][173][174]
The Tungabhadra, with rocky
outcrops, flows into the peninsular
 Krishna river.[175] 
The remaining Indian Plate survives as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India"] peninsular India, the oldest
and geologically most stable part of India. It extends as far north as
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satpura_Range"] Satpura and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vindhya_Range"] Vindhya ranges in central India. These parallel
chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the
coal-rich [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chota_Nagpur_Plateau"] Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east.[176] To the
south, the remaining peninsular landmass, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Plateau"] Deccan Plateau, is
flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Ghats"] Western
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Ghats"] Eastern Ghats;[177] the plateau contains the country's oldest rock
formations, some over one billion years old. Constituted in such
fashion, India lies to the north of the equator between 6° 44′ and 35°
30′ north latitude[i] and 68° 7′ and 97° 25′ east longitude.[178]
India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of
this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India
and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and
Lakshadweep island chains.[179] According to the Indian naval
hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following:

severe floods and course changes.[181][182] Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their
waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain
into the Bay of Bengal;[183] and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narmada_River"] Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Sea"] Arabian Sea.[184] Coastal
features include the marshy [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rann_of_Kutch"] Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundarbans"] Sundarbans delta of eastern
India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh.[185] India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atoll"] coral atolls
 off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman
Sea.[186]
 Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the
economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons.[187] The Himalayas prevent cold
Central Asian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katabatic_wind"] katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than
most locations at similar latitudes.[188][189] The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-
laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's
 rainfall.[187] Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical
humid, and montane.[190]
Temperatures in India have risen by 0.7 °C (1.3 °F) between 1901 and 2018.[191] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_in_India"] Climate change in India
is often thought to be the cause. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retreat_of_glaciers_since_1850"] retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volumetric_flow_rate"] flow rate of
the major Himalayan rivers, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges"] Ganges and the Brahmaputra.[192] According to some current
projections, the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the
present century.[193]
Biodiversity
India is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megadiverse_country"] megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries
which display high [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_diversity"] biological diversity and contain many species

6.0% of all [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowering_plant"] flowering plant species.[197][198] Fully a third of Indian
plant species are endemic.[199] India also contains four of the
world's 34 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_hotspot"] biodiversity hotspots,[69] or regions that display
significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemism.[k][200]
According to official statistics, India's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_cover"] forest cover is 713,789 km2
(275,595 sq mi),  which is 21.71% of the country's total land
area.[70] It can be subdivided further into broad categories of
canopy density, or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by
its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_canopy"] tree canopy.[201] Very dense forest, whose canopy density is
greater than 70%, occupies 3.02% of India's land area.[201][202] It
predominates in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forest"] tropical moist forest of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andaman_Islands"] Andaman Islands,

9.39% of India's land area.[201][202] It predominates in the
 temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas, the moist deciduous
 sal forest of eastern India, and the dry deciduous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teak"] teak forest of

Many Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana, the southern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercontinent"] supercontinent from which
India separated more than 100 million years ago.[208] India's subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a
mass exchange of species. However, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Traps"] volcanism and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_variability_and_change"] climatic changes later caused the extinction of many
endemic Indian forms.[209] Still later, mammals entered India from Asia through two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoogeographical"] zoogeographical
passes flanking the Himalayas.[195] This had the effect of lowering endemism among India's mammals,
which stands at 12.6%,  contrasting with 45.8% among reptiles and 55.8% among amphibians.[198]}
 Among endemics are the vulnerable[210] hooded leaf monkey[211] and the threatened[212] Beddome's
toad[212][213] of the Western Ghats.
India contains 172 IUCN-designated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_endangered_animals_in_India"] threatened animal species, or

Politics and government
Politics
 India is the world's most populous democracy.[222] A parliamentary republic with a multi-party
system,[223] it has eight recognised [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recognised_political_parties_in_India#National"] national parties, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress"] Indian National Congress and the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party"] Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 40 regional parties.[224] The Congress is considered centre-left
in Indian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_culture"] political culture,[225] and the BJP [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics"] right-wing.[226][227][228] For most of the period between 1950
—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament.
Page 11
Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage
with the BJP,[229] as well as with powerful regional parties which
have often forced the creation of multi-party [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government"] coalition governments at
the centre.[230]
In the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957,

the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)"] Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively short-lived, lasting just under two
years.[231] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won an absolute majority. The Congress, as the
largest single party, was able to form a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_government"] minority government led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Narasimha_Rao"] P. V. Narasimha Rao.[232]
A two-year period of political turmoil followed the general election
of 1996. Several short-lived alliances shared power at the centre. The
BJP formed a government briefly in 1996; it was followed by two
comparatively long-lasting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Front_(India)"] United Front coalitions, which depended
on external support. In 1998, the BJP was able to form a successful
 coalition, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). Led by Atal
 Bihari Vajpayee, the NDA became the first non-Congress, coalition
 government to complete a five-year term.[233] Again in the 2004

 supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic and representative democracy, in which "majority
rule is tempered by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_rights"] minority rights protected by law". [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism_in_India"] Federalism in India defines the power distribution

between the union and the states. The Constitution of India, which
came into effect on 26 January 1950,[239] originally stated India to
be a "sovereign, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy"] democratic republic;" this characterisation was
 Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official 
amended in 1971 to "a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic
republic".[240] India's form of government, traditionally described as
"quasi-federal" with a strong centre and weak states,[241] has grown
increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political,
economic, and social changes.[242][243]

implemented by them.[250]
Legislature: The legislature of India is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism"] bicameral parliament. Operating under a
 Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya
Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha"] Lok Sabha (House of the
People).[251] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered
six-year terms.[252] Most are elected indirectly by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India"] state and union territorial legislatures in
numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population.[249] All but two of the
 Lok Sabha's 545 members are elected directly by popular vote; they represent single-
 member constituencies for five-year terms.[253] Two seats of parliament, reserved for Anglo-
Indian in the article 331, have been scrapped.[254][255]
 Judiciary: India has a three-tier unitary independent judiciary[256] comprising the supreme
court, headed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India"] Chief Justice of India, 25 high courts, and a large number of trial
 courts.[256] The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental
rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_jurisdiction"] appellate jurisdiction over
the high courts.[257] It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which
contravene the constitution,[258] and invalidate any government action it deems
unconstitutional.[259]

Administrative divisions
India is a federal union comprising 28 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India"] states and 8 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_territory"] union territories.[16] All states, as well as the union

legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five union
territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the
 States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.[260] There are over a quarter of a
million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.[261]

Foreign, economic and strategic relations
During the 1950s and 60s, India
 played a pivotal role in the Non-
Aligned Movement.[262] From left

In the 1950s, India strongly supported decolonisation in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"] Africa and
 Asia and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_and_the_Non-Aligned_Movement"] played a leading role in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Aligned_Movement"] Non-Aligned Movement.[263]
After initially cordial relations with neighbouring China, India went
to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War"] war with China in 1962, and was widely thought to have been
humiliated.[264] India has had [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_relations"] tense relations with neighbouring
Pakistan; the two nations have gone to war four times: in 1947,
1965, 1971, and 1999. Three of these wars were fought over the
 disputed territory of Kashmir, while the fourth, the 1971 war,
 followed from India's  support for the independence of
Bangladesh.[265] In the late 1980s, the Indian military twice
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Peace_Keeping_Force"] intervened abroad at the invitation of the host country: a peace-
keeping operation in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka"] Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990; and an
armed intervention to prevent a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Maldives_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"] 1988 coup d'état attempt in the
Maldives. After the 1965 war with Pakistan, India began to pursue
close military and economic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India-Soviet_Union_relations"] ties with the Soviet Union; by the late
1960s, the Soviet Union was its largest arms supplier.[266]
 Aside from ongoing its special relationship with Russia,[267] India has wide-ranging defence relations with
 Israel and France. In recent years, it has played key roles in the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"] World Trade Organization. The nation has provided 100,000 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Armed_Forces"] military and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_India"] police
 personnel to serve in 35 UN peacekeeping operations across four continents. It participates in the East Asia
 Summit, the G8+5, and other multilateral forums.[268] India has close economic ties with countries in South
America,[269] Asia, and Africa; it pursues a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_East_policy_(India)"] "Look East" policy that seeks to strengthen partnerships with
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Southeast_Asian_Nations"] ASEAN nations, Japan, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93South_Korea_relations"] South Korea that revolve around many issues, but especially those
involving economic investment and regional security.[270][271]
China's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/596_(nuclear_test)"] nuclear test of 1964, as well as its repeated threats to
intervene in support of Pakistan in the 1965 war, convinced India to
 develop nuclear weapons.[273] India conducted its first nuclear
weapons test in 1974 and carried out [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokhran-II"] additional underground testing
in 1998. Despite criticism and military sanctions, India has signed
 neither the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty nor the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, considering both to be flawed and
discriminatory.[274] India maintains a "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_first_use"] no first use" nuclear policy
 and is developing a nuclear triad capability as a part of its "Minimum
 Credible Deterrence" doctrine.[275][276] It is developing a ballistic
missile defence shield and, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_AMCA"] fifth-generation fighter jet.[277][278]
Other indigenous military projects involve the design and
 implementation of Vikrant-class aircraft carriers and Arihant-class
nuclear submarines.[279]

was the foreign guest was led by
the India's oldest regiment, the
 Maratha Light Infantry, founded in
1768.[272]
Since the end of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War"] Cold War, India has increased its economic,
strategic, and military co-operation with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India%E2%80%93United_States_relations"] United States and the
 European Union.[280] In 2008, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S.%E2%80%93India_Civil_Nuclear_Agreement"] civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United
States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not a party to the Nuclear Non-
 Proliferation Treaty, it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear
Page 15
 Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a
consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state.[281] India subsequently signed co-
 operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia,[282] France,[283] the United
Kingdom,[284] and Canada.[285] 
The President of India is the supreme commander of the nation's
armed forces; with 1.45 million active troops, they compose the
 world's second-largest military. It comprises the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Army"] Indian Army, the
 Indian Navy, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Air_Force"] Indian Air Force, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Coast_Guard"] Indian Coast Guard.[286]
The official Indian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures"] defence budget for 2011 was US$36.03 billion,
or 1.83% of GDP.[287] Defence expenditure was pegged at
US$70.12 billion for fiscal year 2022–23 and, increased 9.8% than

previous fiscal year.[288][289] India is the world's second largest arms
importer; between 2016 and 2020, it accounted for 9.5% of the total
global arms imports.[290] Much of the military expenditure was
focused on defence against Pakistan and countering growing
 Chinese influence in the Indian Ocean.[291] In May 2017, the Indian
Space Research Organisation launched the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia_Satellite"] South Asia Satellite, a
gift from India to its neighbouring [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAARC"] SAARC countries.[292] In
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-400_Triumf"] October 2018, India signed a US$5.43 billion (over ₹400 billion) agreement with Russia to procure four S-
400 Triumf surface-to-air missile defence systems, Russia's most advanced long-range [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_defence"] missile defence
system.[293]
Economy
According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund"] International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2021 was nominally worth
$3.04 trillion; it is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)"] sixth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is around $10.219 trillion, the
 third-largest by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity"] purchasing power parity (PPP).[297] With its average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over
 the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012,[298] India is one of the world's fastest-growing
economies.[299] However, the country ranks 139th in the world in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita"] nominal GDP per capita and 118th in
 GDP per capita at PPP.[300] Until 1991, all Indian governments followed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism"] protectionist policies that were
influenced by socialist economics. Widespread [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licence_Raj"] state intervention and regulation largely walled the economy
 off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its
economy;[301] since then it has moved slowly towards a free-market system[302][303] by emphasising both
foreign trade and direct investment inflows.[304] India has been a member of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"] World Trade Organization
since 1 January 1995.[305]
The 522-million-worker [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_in_India"] Indian labour force is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_labour_force"] world's second-largest, as of 2017.[286] The service
sector makes up 55.6% of GDP, the industrial sector 26.3% and the agricultural sector 18.1%. India's
 foreign exchange remittances of US$87 billion in 2021, highest in the world, were contributed to its
economy by 32 million Indians working in foreign countries.[306] Major agricultural products include: rice,
wheat, oilseed, cotton, jute, tea, sugarcane, and potatoes.[16] Major industries include: textiles,
telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food processing, steel, transport
equipment, cement, mining, petroleum, machinery, and software.[16] In 2006, the share of external trade in
India's GDP stood at 24%, up from 6% in 1985.[302] In 2008, India's share of world trade was 1.68%;[307]
In 2011, India was the world's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_imports"] tenth-largest importer and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_exports"] nineteenth-largest exporter.[308] Major exports
include: petroleum products, textile goods, jewellery, software, engineering goods, chemicals, and
manufactured leather goods.[16] Major imports include: crude oil, machinery, gems, fertiliser, and
Page 16
chemicals.[16] Between 2001 and 2011, the contribution of
petrochemical and engineering goods to total exports grew from
14% to 42%.[309] India was the world's second largest textile
exporter after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"] China in the 2013 calendar year.[310]
Averaging an economic growth rate of 7.5% for several years prior
to 2007,[302] India has more than doubled its hourly wage rates
during the first decade of the 21st century.[311] Some 431 million
Indians have left poverty since 1985; India's middle classes are
projected to number around 580 million by 2030.[312] Though
ranking 51st in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Competitiveness_Report"] global competitiveness, as of 2010, India ranks
17th in financial market sophistication, 24th in the banking sector,
44th in business sophistication, and 39th in innovation, ahead of
several advanced economies.[313] With seven of the world's top 15
information technology outsourcing companies based in India, as
of 2009, the country is viewed as the second-most favourable
outsourcing destination after the United States.[314] India was
ranked 46th in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Innovation_Index"] Global Innovation Index in 2021, it has
increased its ranking considerably since 2015, where it was
81st.[315][316][317][318] India's  consumer market, the world's
 eleventh-largest, is expected to become fifth-largest by 2030.[312] 
A farmer in northwestern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka"] Karnataka
ploughs his field with a tractor even
as another in a field beyond does the
same with a pair of oxen. In 2019,
43% of India's total workforce was
employed in agriculture.[294]
Driven by growth, India's nominal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP_per_capita"] GDP per capita increased
steadily from US$308 in 1991, when economic liberalisation
began, to US$1,380 in 2010, to an estimated US$1,730 in 2016. It
is expected to grow to US$2,313 by 2022.[21] However, it has
remained lower than those of other Asian developing countries
such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand,
and is expected to remain so in the near future. 
India is the world's largest producer
of milk, with the largest population of
cattle. In 2018, nearly 80% of India's
milk was sourced from small farms

milking.[296]
According to a 2011 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PricewaterhouseCoopers"] PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) report,
India's GDP at purchasing power parity could overtake that of the
United States by 2045.[320] During the next four decades, Indian
GDP is expected to grow at an annualised average of 8%, making
it potentially the world's fastest-growing major economy until
2050.[320] The report highlights key growth factors: a young and
rapidly growing working-age population; growth in the
manufacturing sector because of rising education and engineering
skill levels; and sustained growth of the consumer market driven by
a rapidly growing middle-class.[320] The World Bank cautions that,
for India to achieve its economic potential, it must continue to
focus on public sector reform, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_in_India"] transport infrastructure, agricultural
and rural development, removal of labour regulations, education,
 energy security, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_India"] public health and nutrition.[321]

the 1980s, when the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation"] multinational corporations began to set up centres in

China.[324]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_India"] Indian automotive industry, the world's second-fastest growing,
increased domestic sales by 26% during 2009–2010,[325] and
exports by 36% during 2008–2009.[326] At the end of 2011, the
 Indian IT industry employed 2.8 million professionals, generated
revenues close to US$100 billion equalling 7.5% of Indian GDP, and
contributed 26% of India's merchandise exports.[327]

The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_industry_in_India"] pharmaceutical industry in India emerged as a global player. As
of 2021, with 3000 pharmaceutical companies and 10,500 manufacturing units India is the world's third-
largest pharmaceutical producer, largest producer of generic medicines and supply up to 50%—60% of
global vaccines demand, these all contribute up to US$24.44 billions in exports and India's local
pharmacutical market is estimated up to US$42 billion.[328][329] India is among the top 12 biotech
destinations in the world.[330][331] The Indian biotech industry grew by 15.1% in 2012–2013, increasing its
revenues from ₹204.4 billion ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee"] Indian rupees) to ₹235.24 billion (US$3.94 billion at June 2013 exchange
rates).[332]

Socio-economic challenges
Despite economic growth during recent decades, India continues to face socio-economic challenges. In
2006, India contained the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_India"] largest number of people living below the World Bank's international poverty line
of US$1.25 per day.[339] The proportion decreased from 60% in 1981 to 42% in 2005.[340] Under the
World Bank's later revised poverty line, it was 21% in 2011.[l][342] 30.7% of India's children under the age

undernourished.[344][345] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Day_Meal_Scheme"] Mid-Day Meal Scheme attempts to
lower these rates.[346]
A 2018 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk_Free_Foundation"] Walk Free Foundation report estimated that nearly 8 million
people in India were living in different forms of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_slavery"] modern slavery,
such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonded_labour"] bonded labour, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour"] child labour, human trafficking, and forced
begging, among others.[347] According to the 2011 census, there
were 10.1 million child labourers in the country, a decline of
2.6 million from 12.6 million in 2001.[348]
Since 1991, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_states_by_GDP"] economic inequality between India's  states has
consistently grown: the per-capita [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_domestic_product"] net state domestic product of the
richest states in 2007 was 3.2 times that of the poorest.[349]
 Corruption in India is perceived to have decreased. According to the
 Corruption Perceptions Index, India ranked 78th out of 180 countries
in 2018 with a score of 41 out of 100, an improvement from 85th in
2014.[350][351]
Demographics, languages, and religion
 With 1,210,193,422 residents reported in the 2011 provisional census
report,[352] India is the world's second-most populous country. Its
population grew by 17.64% from 2001 to 2011,[353] compared to 21.54%
growth in the previous decade (1991–2001).[353] The human sex ratio,
according to the 2011 census, is 940 females per 1,000 males.[352] The
median age was 28.7 as of 2020.[286] The first post-colonial census,
conducted in 1951, counted 361 million people.[354] Medical advances
made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity
brought about by the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution_in_India"] Green Revolution" have caused India's population to
grow rapidly.[355] 
India by language
The average life expectancy in India is at 70 years—71.5 years for women,
68.7 years for men.[286] There are around 93 physicians per 100,000
people.[356] Migration from rural to urban areas has been an important

dynamic in India's recent history. The number of people living in urban
areas grew by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001.[357] Yet, in 2001, over 70% still lived in rural
areas.[358][359] The level of urbanisation increased further from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in
the 2011 Census. The slowing down of the overall population growth rate was due to the sharp decline in
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_million-plus_urban_agglomerations_in_India"] the growth rate in rural areas since 1991.[360] According to the 2011 census, there are 53 million-plus urban
agglomerations in India; among them Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad"] Hyderabad and
Ahmedabad, in decreasing order by population.[361] The literacy rate in 2011 was 74.04%: 65.46% among
females and 82.14% among males.[362] The rural-urban literacy gap, which was 21.2 percentage points in
2001, dropped to 16.1 percentage points in 2011. The improvement in the rural literacy rate is twice that of
urban areas.[360] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala"] Kerala is the most literate state with 93.91% literacy; while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar"] Bihar the least with

Culture
Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years.[368] During the
 Vedic period (c. 1700 BCE – c. 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu
philosophy, mythology, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_theology"] theology and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_texts"] literature were laid, and many
beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma"] dhárma, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma"] kárma,
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga"] yóga,  and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha"] mokṣa,  were established.[74] India is notable for its
 religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam,
Christianity, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism"] Jainism among the nation's major religions.[369]
The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various
historical schools of thought, including those of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads"] Upanishads,[370]
 the Yoga Sutras,  the Bhakti movement,[369] and by Buddhist
philosophy.[371]

Visual art
India has a very ancient tradition of art, which has exchanged many influences with the rest of Eurasia,
especially in the first millennium, when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_art"] Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to Central, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"] East and
 South-East Asia, the last also greatly influenced by Hindu art.[372] Thousands of seals from the Indus
Valley Civilization of the third millennium BCE have been found, usually carved with animals, but a few
with human figures. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Pashupati%22_seal"] "Pashupati" seal, excavated in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohenjo-daro"] Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29, is the best
known.[373][374] After this there is a long period with virtually nothing surviving.[374][375] Almost all
surviving ancient Indian art thereafter is in various forms of religious [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_sculpture"] sculpture in durable materials, or
coins. There was probably originally far more in wood, which is lost. In north India [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauryan_art"] Mauryan art is the first
imperial movement.[376][377][378] In the first millennium CE, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_art"] Buddhist art spread with Indian religions to
Central, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"] East and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South-East_Asia"] South-East Asia, the last also greatly influenced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_art"] Hindu art.[379] Over the following
centuries a distinctly Indian style of sculpting the human figure developed, with less interest in articulating
precise anatomy than [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_sculpture"] ancient Greek sculpture but showing smoothly-flowing forms expressing prana
("breath" or life-force).[380][381] This is often complicated by the need to give figures multiple arms or
heads, or represent different genders on the left and right of figures, as with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardhanarishvara"] Ardhanarishvara form of
Shiva and Parvati.[382][383]
Page 20
Most of the earliest large sculpture is Buddhist, either excavated from Buddhist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa"] stupas such as Sanchi,
 Sarnath and Amaravati,[384] or is rock-cut [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief"] reliefs at sites such as Ajanta, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karla_Caves"] Karla and Ellora. Hindu and Jain
sites appear rather later.[385][386] In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the
prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups, and sculptors
probably usually served all communities.[387] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gupta_art"] Gupta art, at its peak c. 300 CE – c. 500 CE, is often
regarded as a classical period whose influence lingered for many centuries after; it saw a new dominance of
Hindu sculpture, as at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephanta_Caves"] Elephanta Caves.[388][389] Across the north, this became rather stiff and
formulaic after c. 800 CE, though rich with finely carved detail in the surrounds of statues.[390] But in the
 South, under the Pallava and Chola dynasties, sculpture in both stone and bronze had a sustained period of
great achievement; the large bronzes with Shiva as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nataraja"] Nataraja have become an iconic symbol of
India.[391][392]
 Ancient painting has only survived at a few sites, of which the crowded scenes of court life in the Ajanta
Caves are by far the most important, but it was evidently highly developed, and is mentioned as a courtly
accomplishment in Gupta times.[393][394] Painted manuscripts of religious texts survive from Eastern India
about the 10th century onwards, most of the earliest being Buddhist and later Jain. No doubt the style of
these was used in larger paintings.[395] The Persian-derived [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_painting"] Deccan painting, starting just before the
 Mughal miniature, between them give the first large body of secular painting, with an emphasis on portraits,
and the recording of princely pleasures and wars.[396][397] The style spread to Hindu courts, especially
 among the Rajputs, and developed a variety of styles, with the smaller courts often the most innovative,
with figures such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nih%C3%A2l_Chand"] Nihâl Chand and Nainsukh.[398][399] As a market developed among European

Literature
The earliest literature in India, composed between 1500 BCE and 1200 CE, was in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit"] Sanskrit
language.[411] Major works of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_literature"] Sanskrit literature include the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda"] Rigveda (c. 1500 BCE – c. 1200 BCE), the
epics: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata"] Mahābhārata ( c. 400 BCE – c. 400 CE) and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana"] Ramayana (  c. 300 BCE and later);
Abhijñānaśākuntalam ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Recognition_of_%C5%9Aakuntal%C4%81"] The Recognition of Śakuntalā, and other dramas of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%81lid%C4%81sa"] Kālidāsa ( c. 5th century CE)
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_Classical_poetry"] Mahākāvya poetry.[412][413][414] In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_literature"] Tamil literature, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangam_literature"] Sangam literature (c. 600 BCE – c. 300 BCE)
consisting of 2,381 poems, composed by 473 poets, is the earliest work.[415][416][417][418] From the 14th to
the 18th centuries, India's literary traditions went through a period of drastic change because of the
emergence of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakti_movement"] devotional poets like Kabīr, Tulsīdās, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak"] Guru Nānak. This period was characterised by a
varied and wide spectrum of thought and expression; as a consequence, medieval Indian literary works
differed significantly from classical traditions.[419] In the 19th century, Indian writers took a new interest in
social questions and psychological descriptions. In the 20th century, Indian literature was influenced by the
 works of the Bengali poet, author and philosopher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore"] Rabindranath Tagore,[420] who was a recipient of the
 Nobel Prize in Literature.
Performing arts and media
 Indian music ranges over various traditions and regional styles. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_classical_music"] Classical music encompasses two genres
and their various folk offshoots: the northern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustani_classical_music"] Hindustani and southern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music"] Carnatic schools.[421] Regionalised
popular forms include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmi"] filmi and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_folk_music"] folk music; the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism"] syncretic tradition of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baul"] bauls is a well-known form of the
latter. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_in_India"] Indian dance also features diverse folk and classical forms. Among the better-known [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_folk_dances"] folk dances are:

 Theatre in India melds music, dance, and improvised or written
dialogue.[423] Often based on Hindu mythology, but also borrowing from
medieval romances or social and political events, Indian theatre includes:

The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doordarshan"] state monopoly on television broadcast ended in the 1990s. Since then,
satellite channels have increasingly shaped the popular culture of Indian
society.[431] Today, television is the most penetrative media in India; industry estimates indicate that as of
2012 there are over 554 million TV consumers, 462 million with satellite or cable connections compared to
other forms of mass media such as the press (350 million), radio (156 million) or internet (37 million).[432]
Society 
Traditional Indian society is sometimes defined by social hierarchy.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system_in_India"] Indian caste system embodies much of the social stratification
and many of the social restrictions found on the Indian subcontinent.
Social classes are defined by thousands of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogamous"] endogamous hereditary
groups, often termed as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C4%81ti"] jātis,  or "castes".[433] India declared
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untouchability"] untouchability to be illegal in 1947 and has since enacted other anti-
discriminatory laws and social welfare initiatives.
Muslims offer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah"] namaz at a mosque
in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_values"] Family values are important in the Indian tradition, and multi-
generational [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrilineal"] patrilineal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_family"] joint families have been the norm in India,
though [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_family"] nuclear families are becoming common in urban areas.[434]
An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arranged_marriage_in_the_Indian_subcontinent"] their marriages arranged by their parents or
other family elders.[435] Marriage is thought to be for life,[435] and the divorce rate is extremely low,[436]
with less than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.[437] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage"] Child marriages are common, especially
 in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age.[438] Female
 infanticide in India, and lately female foeticide, have created skewed gender ratios; the number of missing
women in the country quadrupled from 15 million to 63 million in the 50-year period ending in 2014, faster
than the population growth during the same period, and constituting 20 percent of India's female
electorate.[439] Accord to an Indian government study, an additional 21 million girls are unwanted and do
not receive adequate care.[440] Despite a government ban on sex-selective foeticide, the practice remains
commonplace in India, the result of a preference for boys in a patriarchal society.[441] The payment of
dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines.[442] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowry_deaths"] Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bride_burning"] bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.[443]

Pongal, Holi, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durga_Puja"] Durga Puja, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_ul-Fitr"] Eid ul-Fitr, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakr-Id"] Bakr-Id, Christmas, and Vaisakhi.[444][445]
Education
In the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with
81% for men and 65% for women. This compares to 1981 when
the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates
were 18%, 27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In
1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%,[446][447] According to Latika
Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for
every ten villages. Statistically, more caste and religious diversity
reduced private spending. Primary schools taught literacy, so local
diversity limited its growth.[448]
The education system of India is the world's second-largest.[449]
India has over 900 universities, 40,000 colleges[450] and 1.5
million schools.[451] In India's  higher education system, a
significant number of seats are reserved under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_in_India"] affirmative action
policies for the historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India's
improved education system is often cited as one of the main
contributors to its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development_in_India"] economic development.[452][453]

Clothing
From ancient times until the advent of the
modern, the most widely worn traditional dress
in India was draped.[454] For women it took
the form of a sari, a single piece of cloth many
yards long.[454] The sari was traditionally
wrapped around the lower body and the
shoulder.[454] In its modern form, it is
combined with an underskirt, or Indian
petticoat, and tucked in the waist band for
more secure fastening. It is also commonly
worn with an Indian blouse, or choli, which

serves as the primary upper-body garment, the
sari's end—passing over the shoulder—serving
to cover the midriff and obscure the upper
body's contours.[454] For men, a similar but
shorter length of cloth, the dhoti, has served as a lower-body garment.[455]

 The use of stitched clothes became widespread after Muslim rule was established at first by the Delhi
sultanate (ca 1300 CE) and then continued by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire"] Mughal Empire (ca 1525 CE).[456] Among the garments
introduced during this time and still commonly worn are: the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalwar"] shalwars and pyjamas, both styles of trousers,
and the tunics [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurta"] kurta and kameez.[456] In southern India, the traditional draped garments were to see much
longer continuous use.[456]
Page 25
Shalwars are atypically wide at the waist but narrow to a cuffed bottom.
They are held up by a drawstring, which causes them to become pleated
around the waist.[457] The pants can be wide and baggy, or they can be cut
quite narrow, on the bias, in which case they are called churidars. When
they are ordinarily wide at the waist and their bottoms are hemmed but not
cuffed, they are called pyjamas. The kameez is a long shirt or tunic,[458] its
side seams left open below the waist-line.[459] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurta"] kurta is traditionally
collarless and made of cotton or silk; it is worn plain or with embroidered
decoration, such as chikan; and typically falls to either just above or just
below the wearer's knees.[460]

In the last 50 years, fashions have changed a great deal in India.
Increasingly, in urban northern India, the sari is no longer the apparel of
everyday wear, though they remain popular on formal occasions.[461] The
traditional shalwar kameez is rarely worn by younger urban women, who
favour churidars or jeans.[461] In white-collar office settings, ubiquitous air
conditioning allows men to wear sports jackets year-round.[461] For
weddings and formal occasions, men in the middle- and upper classes often
wear bandgala, or short [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehru_jackets"] Nehru jackets, with pants, with the groom and his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groomsmen"] groomsmen sporting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherwani"] sherwanis
and churidars.[461] The dhoti, once the universal garment of Hindu males, the wearing of which in the
homespun and handwoven [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khadi"] khadi allowed Gandhi to bring Indian nationalism to the millions,[462]is seldom
seen in the cities.[461]
Cuisine
The foundation of a typical Indian meal is a cereal cooked in a plain
fashion and complemented with flavourful savoury dishes.[463] The cooked
cereal could be steamed rice; chapati, a thin unleavened bread made from
wheat flour, or occasionally cornmeal, and griddle-cooked dry;[464] the idli,
a steamed breakfast cake, or dosa, a griddled pancake, both leavened and
made from a batter of rice- and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigna_mungo"] gram meal.[465] The savoury dishes might
include lentils, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulses"] pulses and vegetables commonly spiced with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_root"] ginger and
garlic, but also with a combination of spices that may include coriander,
cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardamon"] cardamon and others as informed by culinary
conventions.[463] They might also include poultry, fish, or meat dishes. In
some instances, the ingredients might be mixed during the process of
cooking.[466] 
South Indian vegetarian
thali, or platter
A platter, or thali, used for eating usually has a central place reserved for
the cooked cereal, and peripheral ones for the flavourful accompaniments,
which are often served in small bowls. The cereal and its accompaniments
are eaten simultaneously rather than a piecemeal manner. This is 
 Railway mutton curry from

accomplished by mixing—for example of rice and lentils—or folding,
wrapping, scooping or dipping—such as chapati and cooked vegetables or lentils.[463]
India has distinctive vegetarian cuisines, each a feature of the geographical and cultural histories of its
adherents.[468] The appearance of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahimsa"] ahimsa, or the avoidance of violence toward all forms of life in many
religious orders early in Indian history, especially [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upanishads"] Upanishadic Hinduism, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism"] Buddhism and Jainism, is
thought to have contributed to the predominance of vegetarianism among a large segment of India's Hindu
population, especially in southern India, Gujarat, the Hindi-speaking belt of north-central India, as well as
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thali"]
Page 26
among Jains.[468] Although meat is eaten widely in India, the
proportional consumption of meat in the overall diet is low.[469] Unlike
China, which has increased its per capita meat consumption substantially
in its years of increased economic growth, in India the strong dietary
traditions have contributed to dairy, rather than meat, becoming the
preferred form of animal protein consumption.[470]
The most significant import of cooking techniques into India during the
last millennium occurred during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire"] Mughal Empire. Dishes such as the
pilaf,[471] developed in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_caliphate"] Abbasid caliphate,[472] and cooking
techniques such as the marinating of meat in yogurt, spread into northern
India from regions to its northwest.[473] To the simple yogurt marinade of
Persia, onions, garlic, almonds, and spices began to be added in
India.[473] Rice was partially cooked and layered alternately with the
sauteed meat, the pot sealed tightly, and slow cooked according to another
Persian cooking technique, to produce what has today become the Indian
biryani,[473] a feature of festive dining in many parts of India.[474] In the

entrepreneurial response among people from the Punjab who had been
displaced by the 1947 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India"] partition of India.[468]
Sports and recreation
Several traditional indigenous sports such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabaddi"] kabaddi,  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kho_kho"] kho kho,

composed and transmitted, without the use of script, in an unbroken line of transmission from

"In Punjab, a dry region with grasslands watered by five rivers (hence ‘panch’ and ‘ab’)
draining the western Himalayas, one prehistoric culture left no material remains, but some of
its ritual texts were preserved orally over the millennia. The culture is called Aryan, and
evidence in its texts indicates that it spread slowly south-east, following the course of the
Yamuna and Ganga Rivers. Its elite called itself Arya (pure) and distinguished themselves
sharply from others. Aryans led kin groups organized as nomadic horse-herding tribes. Their
ritual texts are called Vedas, composed in Sanskrit. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_Sanskrit"] Vedic Sanskrit is recorded only in hymns
that were part of Vedic rituals to Aryan gods. To be Aryan apparently meant to belong to the
elite among pastoral tribes. Texts that record Aryan culture are not precisely datable, but they
seem to begin around 1200 BCE with four collections of Vedic hymns (Rg, Sama, Yajur, and
Artharva)."
 (d) Dyson 2018, pp. 14–15 (https://books.google.com/books?id=3TRtDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1
4), "Although the collapse of the Indus valley civilization is no longer believed to have been
due to an ‘Aryan invasion’ it is widely thought that, at roughly the same time, or perhaps a
few centuries later, new Indo-Aryan-speaking people and influences began to enter the
subcontinent from the north-west. Detailed evidence is lacking. Nevertheless, a predecessor
of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the
north-west sometime between 3,900 and 3,000 years ago. This language was related to one
then spoken in eastern Iran; and both of these languages belonged to the Indo-European
language family. ... It seems likely that various small-scale migrations were involved in the
gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics.
However, there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the
one hand, and changes in language and culture on the other. Moreover, the process
whereby a dynamic new force gradually arose—a people with a distinct ideology who
eventually seem to have referred to themselves as ‘Arya’—was certainly two-way. That is, it
involved a blending of new features which came from outside with other features—probably
including some surviving Harappan influences—that were already present. Anyhow, it would
be quite a few centuries before Sanskrit was written down. And the hymns and stories of the
Arya people—especially the Vedas and the later Mahabharata and Ramayana epics—are
poor guides as to historical events. Of course, the emerging Arya were to have a huge
impact on the history of the subcontinent. Nevertheless, little is known about their early
presence.";

"The expansion of Aryan culture is supposed to have begun around 1500 BCE. It should not
be thought that this Aryan emergence (though it implies some migration) necessarily meant
either a sudden invasion of new peoples, or a complete break with earlier traditions. It
comprises a set of cultural ideas and practices, upheld by a Sanskrit-speaking elite, or
Aryans. The features of this society are recorded in the Vedas."

East Pakistan resulted from years of bitter negotiations and recriminations ... The departing
British also decreed that the hundreds of princes, who ruled one-third of the subcontinent
and a quarter of its population, became legally independent, their status to be settled later.
Geographical location, personal and popular sentiment, and substantial pressure and
incentives from the new governments led almost all princes eventually to merge their
domains into either Pakistan or India. ... Each new government asserted its exclusive
sovereignty within its borders, realigning all territories, animals, plants, minerals, and all
other natural and human-made resources as either Pakistani or Indian property, to be used
for its national development... Simultaneously, the central civil and military services and
judiciary split roughly along religious 'communal' lines, even as they divided movable
government assets according to a negotiated formula: 22.7 percent for Pakistan and 77.3
percent for India."

the partition of the British Indian empire into the new nation states of India and Pakistan
produced new diaspora on a vast, and hitherto unprecedented, scale, but hints that the
sheer magnitude of refugee movements in South Asia after 1947 must be understood in the
context of pre-existing migratory flows within the partitioned regions (see also Chatterji
2013). She also demonstrates that the new national states of India and Pakistan were
quickly drawn into trying to stem this migration. As they put into place laws designed to
restrict the return of partition emigrants, this produced new dilemmas for both new nations in
their treatment of ‘overseas Indians’; and many of them lost their right to return to their places
of origin in the subcontinent, and also their claims to full citizenship in host countries."

heard about it on the radio, from relations and friends, by reading newspapers and, later,
through government pamphlets. Among a population of almost four hundred million, where
the vast majority live in the countryside, ploughing the land as landless peasants or
sharecroppers, it is hardly surprising that many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands,
did not hear the new for many weeks afterwards. For some, the butchery and forced
relocation of the summer months of 1947 may hve been the first that they knew about the
creation of the two new states rising from the fragmentary and terminally weakened British

203. Tritsch 2001, p. 14India has two natural zones of thorn forest, one in the rain shadow area of
the Deccan Plateau east of the Western Ghats, and the other in the western part of the Indo-
Gangetic plain. Growth is limited only by moisture availability in these areas, so with
irrigation the fertile alluvial soil of Punjab and Haryana has been turned into India's prime
agricultural area. Much of the thorn forest covering the plains probably had savannah-like
features now no longer visible.

dominated by thorn forest interspersed by rolling grasslands which were grazed on by
millions of Blackbuck, accompanied by their dominant predator, the Cheetah. Always keen
hunters, the Moghul princes kept tame cheetahs which were used to chase and bring down

popular consciousness."

Two years later, Nehru died, humiliated by the Chinese, a broken man. Brigadier Dalvi noted
this in his account of the 1962 War and its aftermath, ‘Without a Nehru India ceased to be the
moral leader of the non-aligned world. Whereas prior to 1962 she wielded immense power
and influence despite her poverty and lack of military power, after the Chinese attack she
was "cut to size" in the words of one unfriendly critic of Nehru.'"

suffered the most humiliating military debacle in its post-independence history, at the hands
of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA). The outcome of this conflict had far-reaching
consequences for Indian foreign and defence policies. The harsh defeat that the Chinese
PLA had inflicted on the Indian Army called into question some of the most deeply held
precepts of Nehru's foreign and defence policies."

territory claimed by them was undertaken in the mistaken belief that Beijing would be
cautious in dealing with India owing to Moscow's stance on the dispute and its growing
proximity to India. These misjudgments would eventually culminate in India's humiliating
defeat in the war of October–November 1962."

"More than 63 million women are “missing” statistically across India, and more than 21
million girls are unwanted by their families, government officials say. The skewed ratio of
men to women is largely the result of sex-selective abortions, and better nutrition and
medical care for boys, according to the government's annual economic survey, which was
released on Monday. In addition, the survey found that “families where a son is born are
more likely to stop having children than families where a girl is born”.

modes of eating. Such newer trends included the consumption of Persian condiments,
