Turkey (Turkish: Türkiye [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Turkish"] [ˈtyɾcije]), officially the Republic of Türkiye
(Turkish: Türkiye Cumhuriyeti [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Turkish"] [ˈtyɾcije dʒumˈhuːɾijeti] (  listen)),  is a
 transcontinental country located mainly on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia"] Anatolian Peninsula in
 Western Asia, with a small portion on the Balkan Peninsula in Southeast
Europe. It shares borders with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea"] Black Sea to the north; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)"] Georgia to the
northeast; Armenia, Azerbaijan, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"] Iran to the east; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq"] Iraq to the southeast;
 Syria and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea"] Mediterranean Sea to the south; the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegean_Sea"] Aegean Sea to the west;
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"] Greece and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgaria"] Bulgaria to the northwest. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus"] Cyprus is located off the south
coast. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people"] Turks form the vast majority of the nation's population and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurds"] Kurds are
 the largest minority.[4] Ankara is Turkey's capital, while Istanbul is its largest
city and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_centre"] financial centre.
One of the world's earliest permanently [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settler"] settled regions, present-day Turkey
was home to important [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic"] Neolithic sites like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe"] Göbekli Tepe, and was inhabited
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization"] ancient civilisations including the Hattians, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_peoples"] Anatolian peoples,
 Mycenaean Greeks and others.[11][12][13][14] Following the conquests of
 Alexander the Great which started the Hellenistic period, most of the ancient
regions in modern Turkey were culturally Hellenised, which continued
during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire"] Byzantine era.[12][15] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuk_Empire"] Seljuk Turks began migrating in the
 11th century, and the Sultanate of Rum ruled Anatolia until the Mongol
invasion in 1243, when it disintegrated into small [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_beyliks"] Turkish principalities.[16]
 Beginning in the late 13th century, the Ottomans united the principalities and
conquered the Balkans, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkification"] Turkification of Anatolia increased during
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire"] Ottoman period. After [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_II"] Mehmed II [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople"] conquered [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople"] Constantinople (Istanbul)
in 1453, Ottoman expansion continued under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selim_I"] Selim I. During the reign of
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_of_the_Ottoman_Empire"] Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire became a global
 power.[11][17][18] From the late 18th century onwards, the empire's power
 declined with a gradual loss of territories.[19] Mahmud II started a period of
modernisation in the early 19th century.[20] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Turk_Revolution"] Young Turk Revolution of
 1908 restricted the authority of the Sultan and restored the Ottoman
 Parliament after a 30-year suspension, ushering the empire into a multi-party
period.[21][22] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1913_Ottoman_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"] 1913 coup d'état put the country under the control of the
 Three Pashas, who facilitated the Empire's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_entry_into_World_War_I"] entry into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"] World War I as part of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Powers"] Central Powers in 1914. During the war, the Ottoman government
committed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Ottoman_genocides"] genocides against its Armenian, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_genocide"] Greek and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_genocide"] Assyrian
subjects.[a][25] After its defeat in the war, the Ottoman Empire was
partitioned.[26]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_War_of_Independence"] Turkish War of Independence against the occupying [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I"] Allied Powers
resulted in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_the_Ottoman_sultanate"] abolition of the Sultanate on 1 November 1922, the signing of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lausanne"] Treaty of Lausanne (which superseded the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_S%C3%A8vres"] Treaty of Sèvres) on 24 July
1923 and the proclamation of the Republic on 29 October 1923. With the
 reforms initiated by the country's first president, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk"] Mustafa Kemal Atatürk,
Turkey became a secular, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_state"] unitary and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_republic"] parliamentary republic. Turkey played
a prominent role in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War"] Korean War and joined [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO"] NATO in 1952. The country
endured several military [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup"] coups in the latter half of the 20th century. The
economy was liberalised in the 1980s, leading to stronger economic growth
and political stability. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_republic"] parliamentary republic was replaced with a
 presidential system by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Turkish_constitutional_referendum"] referendum in 2017.
Turkey is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_power"] regional power and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newly_industrialized_country"] newly industrialized country,[27] with a
geopolitically strategic location.[28] Its economy, which is classified among
 the emerging and growth-leading economies, is the twentieth-largest in the
world by nominal GDP, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)"] eleventh-largest by PPP. It is a charter
member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"] United Nations, an early member of NATO, the IMF, and the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank"] World Bank, and a founding member of the OECD, OSCE, BSEC, OIC,

Name
The English name of Turkey (from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Latin"] Medieval Latin Turchia/Turquia[29]) means "land of the Turks". [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English"] Middle English usage of
Turkye is evidenced in an early work by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaucer"] Chaucer called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_the_Duchess"] The Book of the Duchess (c. 1369). The phrase land of Torke is used in the
15th-century [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Digby_Conversion_of_Saint_Paul"] Digby Mysteries. Later usages can be found in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Dunbar"] Dunbar poems, the 16th century [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipulus_Vocabulorum"] Manipulus Vocabulorum (Turkie)
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon"] Francis Bacon's Sylva Sylvarum (Turky). The modern spelling Turkey dates back to at least 1719.[30]
The name of Turkey appeared in the Western sources after the crusades.[31] In the 14th-century Arab sources, turkiyya is usually
contrasted with turkmaniyya (Turkomania), probably to be understood as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oghuz_Turks"] Oghuz in a broad sense.[32] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Battuta"] Ibn Battuta, in the 1330s
introduces the region as barr al-Turkiyya al-ma'ruf bi-bilad al-Rum ("the Turkish land known as the lands of Rum").[33] The
disintegration of the country after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"] World War I revived [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_nationalism"] Turkish nationalism, and the Türkler için Türkiye ("Turkey for the Turks")
sentiment rose up. With the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Alexandropol"] Treaty of Alexandropol signed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_Grand_National_Assembly"] Government of the Grand National Assembly with Armenia, the
name of Türkiye entered international documents for the first time. In the treaty signed with Afghanistan, the expression Devlet-i
Aliyye-i Türkiyye ("Sublime Turkish State") was used, likened to the Ottoman Empire's name.[31]
In January 2020, the Turkish Exporters' Assembly (TİM) — the umbrella organisation of Turkish exports — announced that it
would use "Made in Turkiye" on all its labels in a bid to standardise branding and the identity of Turkish businesses on the
international stage, using the term 'Turkiye' across all languages around the world.[34]
In December 2021, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan issued a circular calling for exports to be labelled "Made in Türkiye". The
circular also stated that in relation to other governmental communications "necessary sensitivity will be shown on the use of the
phrase 'Türkiye' instead of phrases such as 'Turkey', 'Türkei', 'Turquie' etc."[35][36] The reason given in the circular for preferring
Türkiye was that it "represents and expresses the culture, civilisation, and values of the Turkish nation in the best way". According
to Turkish state broadcaster [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRT_World"] TRT World, it was also to avoid a pejorative association with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)"] turkey, the bird.[34] It was reported in
 January 2022 that the government planned to register Türkiye with the United Nations.[37] Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlüt
Çavuşoğlu sent letters to the UN and other international organisations on 31 May 2022 requesting that they use Türkiye. The UN
agreed and implemented the request immediately.[38][39] Erdoğan also announced that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Airlines"] Turkish Airlines would commence
international operations under its Turkish name Türk Hava Yolları, based on the name change of the country.[40]
History
Prehistory of Anatolia and Eastern Thrace
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia"] Anatolian peninsula, comprising most of modern Turkey, is one of the oldest
permanently settled regions in the world. Various [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Anatolians"] ancient Anatolian populations have lived
in Anatolia, from at least the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic"] Neolithic until the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_civilization"] Hellenistic period.[12] Many of these
 peoples spoke the Anatolian languages, a branch of the larger Indo-European language
family:[42] and, given the antiquity of the Indo-European [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittite_language"] Hittite and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luwian_language"] Luwian languages,
 some scholars have proposed Anatolia as the hypothetical centre from which the Indo-
European languages radiated.[43] The European part of Turkey, called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Thrace"] Eastern Thrace, has
Some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henge"] henges at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe"] Göbekli Tepe were
erected as far back as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe#Layer_III"] 9600 BC, 
also been inhabited since at least forty thousand years ago, and is known to have been in
the Neolithic era by about 6000 BC.[13]
predating those of Stonehenge,
England, by over seven millennia.[41]  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe"] Göbekli Tepe is the site of the oldest known man-made religious structure, a temple dating
to circa 10,000 BC,[41] while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk"] Çatalhöyük is a very large Neolithic and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcolithic"] Chalcolithic
settlement in southern Anatolia, which existed from approximately 7500 BC to 5700 BC. It
is the largest and best-preserved Neolithic site found to date and is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site"] UNESCO World Heritage Site.[44] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neval%C4%B1_%C3%87ori"] Nevalı Çori was an early
 Neolithic settlement on the middle Euphrates, in Şanlıurfa. Urfa Man statue is dated c. 9000 BC to the period of the Pre-Pottery
Neolithic, and is considered as "the oldest naturalistic life-sized sculpture of a human".[45] It is considered as contemporaneous with
the sites of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe"] Göbekli Tepe. The settlement of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy"] Troy started in the Neolithic Age and continued into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age"] Iron Age.[46]
The earliest recorded inhabitants of Anatolia were the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattians"] Hattians and Hurrians, non-Indo-European peoples who inhabited central
and eastern Anatolia, respectively, as early as c. 2300 BC. Indo-European [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hittites"] Hittites came to Anatolia and gradually absorbed the
Hattians and Hurrians c. 2000–1700 BC. The first major empire in the area was founded by the Hittites, from the 18th through the
13th century BC. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria"] Assyrians conquered and settled parts of southeastern Turkey as early as 1950 BC until the year 612 BC,[47]
although they [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_continuity"] have remained a minority in the region, namely in Hakkari, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9E%C4%B1rnak_Province"] Şırnak and Mardin.[48]
 Urartu re-emerged in Assyrian inscriptions in the 9th century BC as a powerful northern rival of Assyria.[49] Following the collapse
of the Hittite empire c. 1180 BC, the Phrygians, an Indo-European people, achieved ascendancy in Anatolia until their kingdom
was destroyed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimmerians"] Cimmerians in the 7th century BC.[50] Starting from 714 BC, Urartu shared the same fate and dissolved in
590 BC,[51] when it was conquered by the Medes. The most powerful of Phrygia's successor states were Lydia, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caria"] Caria and Lycia.

 Sardis was an ancient city at the location of modern Sart in Western Turkey. The city
 served as the capital of the ancient kingdom of Lydia. As one of the seven churches of
 Asia, it was addressed in the Book of Revelation in the New Testament,[52] The Lydian
Lion coins were made of electrum, a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver but of
variable precious metal value. During the reign of King [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croesus"] Croesus that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgist"] metallurgists of
Sardis discovered the secret of separating [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"] gold from silver, thereby producing both metals
of a purity never known before.[53]
Antiquity
Starting around 1200 BC, the coast of Anatolia was heavily settled by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolians"] Aeolian and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionians"] Ionian
Greeks. Numerous important [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polis"] cities were founded by these colonists, such as Didyma,
Miletus, Ephesus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smyrna"] Smyrna (now İzmir) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantium"] Byzantium (now Istanbul), the latter founded
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks"] Greek colonists from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megara"] Megara in 657 BC.[54] Some of the most prominent pre-Socratic
philosophers lived in the city of Miletus. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus"] Thales of Miletus (c. 624 BCE – c. 546 BCE)
considered as first philosopher in the Greek tradition. [55][56] and he is otherwise
historically recognized as the first individual known to have entertained and engaged in
 scientific philosophy.[57][58] In Miletus, he is followed by two other significant pre-
Socratic philosophers [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander"] Anaximander (c. 610 BCE – c. 546 BCE) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximenes_of_Miletus"] Anaximenes (c. 585
BCE – c. 525 BCE) (known collectively, to modern scholars, as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milesian_school"] Milesian school).

capital of the Hittites.

 Aizanoi belongs to Phrygia.
For several centuries prior to the great [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars"] Persian invasion of Greece, perhaps the very greatest and wealthiest city of the Greek world
was Miletus, which founded more colonies than any other Greek city,[59] particularly in the Black Sea region. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diogenes_the_Cynic"] Diogenes the Cynic
was one of the founders of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynicism_(philosophy)"] Cynic philosophy born in one of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionians"] Ionian colonies [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinop,_Turkey"] Sinope on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea"] Black Sea coast of Anatolia in 412.

 Trojan War took place in the ancient city of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy"] Troy by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaeans_(Homer)"] Achaeans (Greeks) after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_(mythology)"] Paris of
Troy took [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_of_Troy"] Helen from her husband Menelaus, king of Sparta. The war is one of the most
important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of
 Greek literature, most notably [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer"] Homer's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad"] Iliad.  Whether there is any historical reality
behind the Trojan War remains an open question. Those who believe that the stories of
the Trojan War are derived from a specific historical conflict usually date it to the 12th or
11th century BC, often preferring the dates given by Eratosthenes, 1194–1184 BC, which
roughly correspond to archaeological evidence of a catastrophic burning of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_VII"] Troy VII,[65]
and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse"] Late Bronze Age collapse.
The first state that was called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia"] Armenia by neighbouring peoples was the state of the
 Armenian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orontid_dynasty"] Orontid dynasty, which included parts of what is now eastern Turkey
beginning in the 6th century BC. In Northwest Turkey, the most significant tribal group in
Thrace was the Odyrisians, founded by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teres_I"] Teres I.[66]
All of modern-day Turkey was conquered by the Persian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire"] Achaemenid Empire during the
6th century BC.[67] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars"] Greco-Persian Wars started when the Greek city states on the
coast of Anatolia rebelled against Persian rule in 499 BC.
 Artemisia I of Caria was a queen of the ancient Greek city-state of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halicarnassus"] Halicarnassus and she
fought as an ally of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I"] Xerxes I, King of Persia against the independent Greek city states
during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Persian_invasion_of_Greece"] second Persian invasion of Greece. She personally commanded her
contribution of five ships at the naval [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Artemisium"] battle of Artemisium in 480 BC.[68][69][70]
The territory of Turkey later fell to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great"] Alexander the Great in 334 BC,[71] which led to
increasing cultural homogeneity and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenization"] Hellenization in the area.[12] Following Alexander's
death in 323 BC, Anatolia was subsequently divided into a number of small Hellenistic
kingdoms, all of which became part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic"] Roman Republic by the mid-1st century
BC.[72] The process of Hellenization that began with Alexander's conquest accelerated
under Roman rule, and by the early centuries of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Era"] Christian Era, the local Anatolian
 languages and cultures had become extinct, being largely replaced by ancient Greek
language and culture.[15][73] From the 1st century BC up to the 3rd century CE, large
parts of modern-day Turkey were contested between the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire"] Romans and neighbouring

 Galatia was an ancient area in the highlands of central Anatolia inhabited by the Celts. The terms "Galatians" came to be used by
the Greeks for the three Celtic peoples of Anatolia: the Tectosages, the Trocmii, and the Tolistobogii.[74][75] By the 1st century BC
the Celts had become so [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenization"] Hellenized that some Greek writers called them Hellenogalatai (Ἑλληνογαλάται).[76] Galatia was named
after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauls"] Gauls from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrace"] Thrace (cf. Tylis), who settled here and became a small transient foreign tribe in the 3rd century BC, following
the supposed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_invasion_of_the_Balkans"] Gallic invasion of the Balkans in 279 BC.
 Kingdom of Pontus was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period"] Hellenistic kingdom, centered in the historical region of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontus_(region)"] Pontus and ruled by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridatic_dynasty"] Mithridatic dynasty of
 Persian origin,[77][78][79][80] which may have been directly related to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_I"] Darius the Great and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_dynasty"] Achaemenid dynasty.[81][80] The
kingdom was proclaimed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridates_I_of_Pontus"] Mithridates I in 281 BC and lasted until its conquest by the Roman Republic in 63 BC. The Kingdom
of Pontus reached its largest extent under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridates_VI"] Mithridates VI the Great, who conquered Colchis, Cappadocia, Bithynia, the Greek
colonies of the Tauric Chersonesos. After a long struggle with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire"] Rome in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mithridatic_Wars"] Mithridatic Wars, Pontus was defeated.
All territories corresponding to modern Turkey eventually fell into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire"] Roman Empire’s control.
Early Christian and Roman period
According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Apostles"] Acts of Apostles,[83] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioch"] Antioch (now Antakya), a city in southern Turkey,
is where followers of Jesus were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Christianity"] first called "Christians" and became very quickly an
important center of Christianity.[84][85] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Apostle"] Paul the Apostle traveled to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus"] Ephesus and stayed
there for almost three years, probably working there as a tentmaker,[86] as he had done
when he stayed in Corinth. He is claimed to have performed numerous miracles, healing
people and casting out demons, and he apparently organized missionary activity in other
regions.[87] Paul left [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus"] Ephesus after an attack from a local silversmith resulted in a pro-
 Artemis riot involving most of the city.[87]
In the year 123, Emperor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian"] Hadrian traveled to Anatolia. Numerous monuments erected for
his arrival and he met his lover [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous"] Antinous from Bithynia.[88] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian"] Hadrian focused on the
Greek revival and built several temples and improved the cities. Cyzicus, Pergamon,
Smyrna, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus"] Ephesus and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardes"] Sardes were promoted as regional centres for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_cult_(ancient_Rome)"] Imperial cult
([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocorate"] neocoros) during this period.[89] 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire"] Byzantine Empire in 555 under
 Justinian the Great, at its greatest
extent since the fall of the Western
Roman Empire.
Byzantine period
In 324, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I"] Constantine I chose Byzantium to be the new capital of the Roman Empire,
renaming it [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Rome"] New Rome. Under Constantine, Christianity did not become the exclusive
 religion of the state, but enjoyed imperial preference since he supported it with generous Originally a church, then a mosque,
privileges. Following the death of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I"] Theodosius I in 395 and the permanent division of the
Roman Empire between his two sons, the city, which would popularly come to be known
as Constantinople, became the capital of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire"] Eastern Roman Empire. This empire, which
would later be branded by historians as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire"] Byzantine Empire, ruled most of the territory
of present-day Turkey until the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages"] Late Middle Ages;[90] although the eastern regions 
later a museum, and now a mosque
again, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagia_Sophia"] Hagia Sophia in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul"] Istanbul
was built by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire"] Byzantine emperor
 Justinian I in 532–537 AD.[82]
remained firmly in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian"] Sasanian hands until the first half of the 7th century CE. The frequent
 Byzantine-Sassanid Wars, a continuation of the centuries-long [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman-Persian_Wars"] Roman-Persian Wars, took place in various parts of present-day
Turkey between the 4th and 7th centuries CE. Several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenical_councils"] ecumenical councils of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Church"] early Church were held in cities located in
present-day Turkey, including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea"] First Council of Nicaea (Iznik) in 325, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Constantinople"] First Council of Constantinople (Istanbul) in 381, the
 Council of Ephesus in 431, and the Council of Chalcedon (Kadıköy) in 451.[91] During most of its existence, the Byzantine
Empire was one of the most powerful economic, cultural, and military forces in Europe.[92]
Seljuks and the Ottoman Empire
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuq_dynasty"] House of Seljuk originated from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%B1n%C4%B1k_(tribe)"] Kınık branch of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oghuz_Turks"] Oghuz Turks who resided on the periphery of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_history#Abbasids_-_%22Islamic_Golden_Age%22"] Muslim world, in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oghuz_Yabgu_State"] Yabgu Khaganate of the Oğuz confederacy, to the north of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea"] Caspian and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aral_Sea"] Aral Seas, in the 9th century.[93] In the 10th
 century, the Seljuks started migrating from their ancestral homeland into Persia, which became the administrative core of the Great
Seljuk Empire, after its foundation by Tughril.[94]
In the latter half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks began penetrating into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Armenia"] medieval Armenia and the eastern regions of Anatolia.
In 1071, the Seljuks defeated the Byzantines at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Manzikert"] Battle of Manzikert, starting the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkification"] Turkification process in the area; the Turkish
language and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"] Islam were introduced to Armenia and Anatolia, gradually spreading throughout the region. The slow transition from
a predominantly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians"] Christian and Greek-speaking Anatolia to a predominantly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim"] Muslim and Turkish-speaking one was underway. The
 Mevlevi Order of dervishes, which was established in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konya"] Konya during the 13th century by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufi"] Sufi poet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celaleddin_Rumi"] Celaleddin Rumi, played a
significant role in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamization"] Islamization of the diverse people of Anatolia who had previously been Hellenized.[96][97] Thus, alongside

 the Turkification of the territory, the culturally Persianized Seljuks set the basis for a Turko-
Persian principal culture in Anatolia,[98] which their eventual successors, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_Ottoman_Empire"] the Ottomans,
would take over.[99][100]In 1243, the Seljuk armies were defeated by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire"] Mongols at the
 Battle of Köse Dağ, causing the Seljuk Empire's power to slowly disintegrate. In its wake,
one of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolian_beyliks"] Turkish principalities governed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osman_I"] Osman I would evolve over the next 200
years into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire"] Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans completed their conquest of the Byzantine
Empire by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople"] capturing its capital, Constantinople, in 1453: their commander thenceforth
being known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_the_Conqueror"] Mehmed the Conqueror.
In 1514, Sultan [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selim_I"] Selim I (1512–1520) successfully expanded the empire's southern and
eastern borders by defeating Shah [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_I"] Ismail I of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safavid_dynasty"] Safavid dynasty in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chaldiran"] Battle of Chaldiran.
In 1517, Selim I expanded Ottoman rule into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Algeria"] Algeria and Egypt, and created a naval
presence in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea"] Red Sea. Subsequently, a contest started between the Ottoman and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire"] Portuguese
 empires to become the dominant sea power in the Indian Ocean, with a number of naval
battles in the Red Sea, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Sea"] Arabian Sea and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf"] Persian Gulf. The Portuguese presence in the
Indian Ocean was perceived as a threat to the Ottoman monopoly over the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road"] ancient trade routes
between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"] East Asia and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe"] Western Europe. Despite the increasingly prominent European
presence, the Ottoman Empire's trade with the east continued to flourish until the second half
of the 18th century.[103]
The Ottoman Empire's power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly
during the reign of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suleiman_the_Magnificent"] Suleiman the Magnificent, who personally instituted major legislative
changes relating to society, education, taxation and criminal law.
 Topkapı and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolmabah%C3%A7e_Palace"] Dolmabahçe palaces
were the primary residences of

The empire was often at odds with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire"] Holy Roman Empire in its steady advance towards
 Central Europe through the Balkans and the southern part of the Polish–Lithuanian
Commonwealth.[104]
between 1465 to 1856[101] and
1856 to 1922,[102] respectively. 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Navy"] Ottoman Navy contended with
several Holy Leagues, such as those in
1538, 1571, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_League_(1684)"] 1684 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_League_(1717)"] 1717 (composed
primarily of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg_Spain"] Habsburg Spain, the
 Republic of Genoa, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice"] Republic of Venice, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Hospitaller"] Knights of St. John, the
 Papal States, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchy_of_Tuscany"] Grand Duchy of Tuscany and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Savoy"] Duchy of Savoy), for the
control of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea"] Mediterranean Sea.
In the east, the Ottomans were often at war with Safavid Persia over conflicts
stemming from territorial disputes or religious differences between the 16th
and 18th centuries.[105] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman-Persian_Wars"] Ottoman wars with Persia continued as the
Zand, Afsharid, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qajar_dynasty"] Qajar dynasties succeeded the Safavids in Iran, until the
 first half of the 19th century.
Even further east, there was an extension of the Habsburg-Ottoman conflict,
in that the Ottomans also had to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_expedition_to_Aceh"] send soldiers to their farthest and easternmost
vassal and territory, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aceh_Sultanate"] Aceh Sultanate[106][107] in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"] Southeast Asia, to defend
it from European colonizers as well as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_de_Salcedo"] Latino invaders who had crossed
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America"] Latin America and had Christianized the formerly Muslim-dominated
Philippines.[108] 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vienna"] Second Ottoman Siege of Vienna in 1683 (the
 First Siege was in 1529) initiated the Great Turkish
 War (1683–1699) between the Ottomans and a Holy
League of European states.
 From the 16th to the early 20th centuries, the Ottoman Empire also fought
twelve wars with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsardom_of_Russia"] Russian Tsardom and Empire. These were initially about Ottoman territorial expansion and consolidation in
southeastern and eastern Europe; but starting from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_(1768%E2%80%931774)"] Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774), they became more about the survival of
the Ottoman Empire, which had begun to lose its strategic territories on the northern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea"] Black Sea coast to the advancing Russians.
From the second half of the 18th century onwards, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_the_Ottoman_Empire"] Ottoman Empire began to decline. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzimat"] Tanzimat reforms, initiated by
 Mahmud II just before his death in 1839, aimed to modernise the Ottoman state in line with the progress that had been made in
Western Europe. The efforts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midhat_Pasha"] Midhat Pasha during the late Tanzimat era led the Ottoman [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_constitution_of_1876"] constitutional movement of 1876, which
 introduced the First Constitutional Era, but these efforts proved to be inadequate in most fields, and failed to stop the dissolution of
the empire.[109]
As the empire gradually shrank in size, military power and wealth; especially after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Eastern_Crisis"] Ottoman economic crisis and default in
1875[110] which led to uprisings in the Balkan provinces that culminated in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Turkish_War_(1877%E2%80%931878)"] Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878); many Balkan
Muslims migrated to the Empire's heartland in Anatolia,[111][112] along with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassians"] Circassians fleeing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian%E2%80%93Circassian_War"] Russian conquest of the
Caucasus. According to some estimates, up to 1.5 million Muslim [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassians"] Circassians died during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassian_genocide"] Circassian genocide, the survivors

 seek refugee in Ottoman Empire. The decline of the Ottoman Empire led to a rise in nationalist sentiment among its various subject
peoples, leading to increased ethnic tensions which occasionally burst into violence, such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamidian_massacres"] Hamidian massacres of Armenians,
which claimed up to 300,000 lives.[113]
The loss of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumelia"] Rumelia (Ottoman territories in Europe) with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Balkan_War"] First Balkan War
(1912–1913) was followed by the arrival of millions of Muslim refugees
([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhacir"] muhacir) to Istanbul and Anatolia.[114] Historically, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumelia_Eyalet"] Rumelia Eyalet and
 Anatolia Eyalet had formed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_divisions_of_the_Ottoman_Empire"] administrative core of the Ottoman Empire, with
their governors titled [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beylerbey"] Beylerbeyi participating in the Sultan's Divan, so the loss
of all Balkan provinces beyond the Midye-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enez"] Enez border line according to the
 London Conference of 1912–13 and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_London_(1913)"] Treaty of London (1913) was a major
shock for the Ottoman society and led to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1913_Ottoman_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"] 1913 Ottoman coup d'état. In the
 Second Balkan War (1913) the Ottomans managed to recover their former
capital [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edirne"] Edirne (Adrianople) and its surrounding areas in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Thrace"] East Thrace, which was
formalised with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Constantinople_(1913)"] Treaty of Constantinople (1913).  The 1913 coup d'état
effectively put the country under the control of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Pashas"] Three Pashas, making sultans
 Mehmed V and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmed_VI"] Mehmed VI largely symbolic figureheads with no real political

after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sarikamish"] Battle of Sarikamish (1914–1915). Russian forces advanced into northeastern
Anatolia and controlled the major cities there until retreating from World War I with the
 Treaty of Brest-Litovsk following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution"] Russian Revolution (1917). During the war, the
empire's Armenian subjects were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehcir_Law"] deported to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria"] Syria as part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide"] Armenian genocide. As a result, an estimated 600,000[115] to
 more than 1 million,[115] or up to 1.5 million[116][117][118] Armenians were killed. The Turkish government has refused to
 acknowledge the events as genocide and states that Armenians were only "relocated" from the eastern war zone.[119] Genocidal
campaigns were also committed against the empire's other minority groups such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_genocide"] Assyrians and Greeks.[120][121][122] The
share of non-Muslims in area within Turkey's current borders declined from 20-22% in 1914, or about 3.3.–3.6 million people, to
 around 3% in 1927.[123] Following the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918, the victorious Allied Powers sought to partition

War I prompted the establishment of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_National_Movement"] Turkish National Movement. Under the leadership
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk"] Mustafa Kemal Pasha, a military commander who had distinguished himself during the

and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Provisional_Government"] Turkish Provisional Government in Ankara, which had declared itself the legitimate
government of the country on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey"] 23 April 1920, started to formalise the legal transition from
the old Ottoman into the new Republican political system. On 1 November 1922, the
Turkish Parliament in Ankara formally [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolition_of_the_Ottoman_Sultanate"] abolished the Sultanate, thus ending 623 years of
monarchical Ottoman rule. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lausanne"] Treaty of Lausanne of 24 July 1923, which superseded the
Treaty of Sèvres,[124][125] led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the
newly formed "Republic of Turkey" as the successor state of the Ottoman Empire, and the
republic was officially proclaimed on 29 October 1923 in Ankara, the country's new
 capital.[127] The Lausanne Convention stipulated a population exchange between Greece
and Turkey, whereby 1.1 million Greeks left Turkey for Greece in exchange for 380,000 Muslims transferred from Greece to
Turkey.[128]

 Mustafa Kemal became the republic's first President and subsequently introduced many
reforms. The reforms aimed to transform the old [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet_(Ottoman_Empire)"] religion-based and multi-communal
Ottoman [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy"] constitutional monarchy into a Turkish [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_state"] nation state that would be governed as a
 parliamentary republic under a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Constitution_of_1924"] secular constitution.[130] With the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surname_Law"] Surname Law of 1934,
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Parliament"] Turkish Parliament bestowed upon Mustafa Kemal the honorific surname "Atatürk"

tribes, which were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudalism"] feudal (manorial) communities led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_chief"] chieftains ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agha_(title)"] agha) during the
Ottoman period, became discontent about certain aspects of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atat%C3%BCrk%27s_Reforms"] Atatürk's reforms aiming to
 modernise the country, such as secularism (the Sheikh Said rebellion, 1925)[132] and land
reform (the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dersim_rebellion"] Dersim rebellion, 1937–1938),[133] and staged armed revolts that were put
down with military operations. 
Eighteen female [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament"] deputies joined the
 Turkish Parliament with the 1935
general elections. Turkish women
 gained the right to vote and to hold
elected office as a mark of the far-
reaching [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atat%C3%BCrk%27s_Reforms"] social changes initiated by
Atatürk.[129]
 İsmet İnönü became Turkey's second President following Atatürk's death on 10 November 1938. On 29 June 1939, the Republic of
Hatay voted in favour of joining Turkey with a referendum. Turkey [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Cairo_Conference"] remained neutral during most of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"] World War II, but entered the
closing stages of the war on the side of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II"] Allies on 23 February 1945. On 26 June 1945, Turkey became a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Charter"] charter member of the
 United Nations.[134] In the following year, the single-party period in Turkey came to an end, with the first multiparty elections in
1946. In 1950 Turkey became a member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe"] Council of Europe.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democrat_Party_(Turkey,_1946%E2%80%9361)"] Democratic Party established by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cel%C3%A2l_Bayar"] Celâl Bayar won the 1950, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_Turkish_general_election"] 1954 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1957_Turkish_general_election"] 1957 general
elections and stayed in power for a decade, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adnan_Menderes"] Adnan Menderes as the Prime Minister
and Bayar as the President. After fighting as part of the United Nations forces in the
 Korean War, Turkey joined [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO"] NATO in 1952, becoming a bulwark against Soviet expansion
into the Mediterranean. Turkey subsequently became a founding member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development"] OECD in
1961, and an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ankara_Agreement"] associate member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community"] EEC in 1963.[135]

 Second Cairo Conference, 1943. 
The country's tumultuous transition to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_period_of_the_Republic_of_Turkey"] multiparty democracy was interrupted by military
 coups d'état in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960_Turkish_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"] 1960 and 1980, as well as by military memorandums in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Turkish_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"] 1971 and
1997.[136][137] Between 1960 and the end of the 20th century, the prominent leaders in
 Turkish politics who achieved multiple election victories were Süleyman Demirel, Bülent
Ecevit and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turgut_%C3%96zal"] Turgut Özal. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tansu_%C3%87iller"] Tansu Çiller became the first female prime minister of Turkey in
1993.
Following a decade of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypriot_intercommunal_violence"] Cypriot intercommunal violence and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1974_Cypriot_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"] coup in Cyprus on 15 July 1974 staged by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EOKA_B"] EOKA B
paramilitary organisation, which overthrew President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makarios_III"] Makarios and installed the pro-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enosis"] Enosis (union with Greece) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Sampson"] Nikos Sampson as

without restoring the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_ante_bellum"] status quo ante at the end of the military operation.[138] In 1983 the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Republic_of_Northern_Cyprus"] Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,
which is recognised only by Turkey, was established.[139] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annan_Plan_for_Cyprus"] Annan Plan for reunifying the island was supported by the majority
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Cypriots"] Turkish Cypriots, but rejected by the majority of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Cypriots"] Greek Cypriots, in separate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Cypriot_Annan_Plan_referendums"] referendums in 2004. However, negotiations for
solving the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_dispute"] Cyprus dispute are still ongoing between Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot political leaders.[140]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish%E2%80%93Turkish_conflict_(1978%E2%80%93present)"] conflict between Turkey and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdistan_Workers%27_Party"] Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) (designated a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_designated_terrorist_groups"] terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United
States,[141] and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"] European Union[142]) has been active since 1984, primarily in the southeast of the country. More than 40,000
people have died as a result of the conflict.[143][144][145] In 1999 PKK's founder [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_%C3%96calan"] Abdullah Öcalan was arrested and sentenced for
 terrorism[141][142] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason"] treason charges.[146][147] In the past, various [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_people"] Kurdish groups have unsuccessfully sought [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_separatism"] separation from
 Turkey to create an independent Kurdish state, while others have more recently pursued provincial autonomy and greater political
and cultural rights for Kurds in Turkey. In the 21st century some reforms have taken place to improve the cultural rights of ethnic
minorities in Turkey, such as the establishment of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRT_Kurd%C3%AE"] TRT Kurdî, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRT_Arabi"] TRT Arabi and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRT_Avaz"] TRT Avaz by the TRT.
Since the liberalisation of the Turkish economy in the 1980s, the country has enjoyed stronger economic growth and greater
political stability.[148] Turkey applied for full membership of the EEC in 1987, joined the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union"] EU Customs Union in 1995 and started
 accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005.[149][150] In a non-binding vote on 13 March 2019, the European
Parliament called on the EU governments to suspend EU accession talks with Turkey, citing violations of human rights and the rule
of law; but the negotiations, effectively on hold since 2018, remain active as of 2020.[151]
In 2013, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_protests_in_Turkey"] widespread protests erupted in many Turkish provinces, sparked by a plan to demolish [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gezi_Park"] Gezi Park but soon growing into
general anti-government dissent.[152] On 15 July 2016, an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Turkish_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt"] unsuccessful coup attempt tried to oust the government.[153] As a
reaction to the failed coup d'état, the government carried out [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Turkish_purges"] mass purges.[154][155]

 Between 9 October and 25 November 2019, Turkey invaded north-eastern
Syria.[156][157][158]
Administrative divisions
Turkey has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_state"] unitary structure in terms of administration and this aspect is one of the
most important factors shaping the Turkish public administration. When three powers
(executive, legislative and judiciary) are taken into account as the main functions of
the state, local administrations have little power. Turkey does not have a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism"] federal
system, and the provinces are subordinate to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_government"] central government in Ankara. Local
administrations were established to provide services in place and the government is
represented by the province governors (vali) and town governors (kaymakam). Other 
 Anıtkabir, the mausoleum of Mustafa
Kemal Atatürk in Ankara, is visited by
large crowds every year during national
holidays, such as Republic Day on 29
October.
senior public officials are also appointed by the central government instead of the
mayors (belediye başkanı) or elected by constituents.[159] Turkish municipalities have local legislative bodies (belediye meclisi) for
decision-making on municipal issues.
Within this unitary framework, Turkey is subdivided into 81 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Turkey"] provinces (il or vilayet) for administrative purposes. Each province is
divided into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Turkey"] districts (ilçe), for a total of 973 districts.[160] Turkey is also subdivided into 7 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_regions_of_Turkey"] regions (bölge) and 21 subregions for
geographic, demographic and economic purposes; this does not refer to an administrative division.

Government and politics
Turkey is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_system"] presidential [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic"] republic within a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_period_of_the_Republic_of_Turkey"] multi-party system.[161] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Turkey"] current constitution was approved by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1982_Turkish_constitutional_referendum"] referendum in 1982,
which determines the government's structure, lays forth the ideals and standards of the state's conduct, and sets out the state's
responsibility to its citizens. Furthermore, the constitution specifies the people's rights and obligations, as well as principles for the
delegation and exercise of sovereignty that belongs to the people of Turkey.[162]
 In the Turkish unitary system, citizens are subject to three levels of government: national, provincial, and local. The local
government's duties are commonly split between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_corporation"] municipal governments and districts, in which executive and legislative officials
are elected by a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting_system"] plurality vote of citizens by district. Turkey is subdivided into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Turkey"] 81 provinces for administrative purposes. Each
province is divided into districts, for a total of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_districts_in_Turkey"] 973 districts.
The government, regulated by a system of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers"] separation of powers as defined by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Turkey"] constitution of Turkey, comprises three branches:
Legislative: The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicameralism"] unicameral [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_National_Assembly_of_Turkey"] Parliament makes law, debates and adopts the budget bills, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war"] declares war, approves
treaties, proclaims [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty"] amnesty and pardon, and has the power of impeachment, by which it can remove sitting
members of the government.[163]
Executive: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Turkey"] The president is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief"] commander-in-chief of the military, can veto [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_(law)"] legislative bills before they become
law (subject to parliamentary override), can issue [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decree"] presidential decrees on matters regarding executive power with
exception of fundamental rights, individual rights and certain political rights (parliamentary laws prevail
presidential decrees), and appoints the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Turkey"] members of the Cabinet and other officers, who administer and enforce
national laws and policies.[164]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabzon_Province"]

Judicial: The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_Turkey"] Constitutional Court (for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality"] constitutional adjudication and review of
individual applications concerning human rights), the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Cassation_of_Turkey"] Court of Cassation (final
decision maker in ordinary judiciary), the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Council_of_State"] Council of State (final decision maker
in administrative judiciary) and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Jurisdictional_Disputes"] Court of Jurisdictional Disputes (for resolving
the disputes between courts for constitutional jurisdiction) are the four
organizations that are described by the Constitution as supreme courts. The
judges of the Constitutional Court are appointed by the president and the
parliament.[165]
The Parliament has 600 voting members, each representing a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituency"] constituency for a five-year term.
Parliamentairy seats are distributed among the provinces by population, conform with the
census apportionment. The president is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_presidential_elections"] elected by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_vote"] direct vote and serves a five-year term. The
president can't run for re-elections after two terms of five-year. If the Parliament decides to
prematurely renew the presidential elections during the second term of the President, he or she
may run for a third presidential term. Elections for the Parliament and presidential elections are
held on the same day. The Constitutional Court is composed of fifteen members. A member is
elected for a term of twelve years and can't be reelected. The members of the Constitutional
Court are obliged to retire when they are over the age of sixty-five.[166]

Elections in Turkey are held for six functions of government: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_presidential_elections"] presidential elections (national),

 provincial or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_municipalities_in_Turkey"] municipal council members (local) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhtar_(title)"] muhtars (local). Apart from elections,
 referenda are also held occasionally. 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_Turkey"] Constitutional Court, where
the nation's highest court for

Every Turkish citizen who has turned 18 has the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage"] right to vote and stand as a candidate at
elections. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage"] Universal suffrage for both sexes has been applied throughout Turkey since 1934 and
before most countries. In Turkey, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout"] turnout rates of both local and general elections are high compared
 to many other countries, which usually stands higher than 80 percent.[167] There are 600 members of
parliament who are elected for a five-year term by a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation"] party-list proportional representation system
from 88 electoral districts. The Constitutional Court can strip the public financing of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_parties_in_Turkey"] political parties
that it deems [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism_in_Turkey"] anti-secular or having ties to terrorism, or ban their existence altogether.[168][169] The
 electoral threshold for political parties at national level is seven percent of the votes.[170] Smaller
parties can avoid the electoral threshold by forming an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_alliance"] alliance with other parties, in which it is
sufficient that the total votes of the alliance passes 7%. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician"] Independent candidates are not subject to an
electoral threshold.
After World War II, Turkey operated under a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_period_of_the_Republic_of_Turkey"] multi-party system. On the right side of the Turkish
 political spectrum, parties like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(Turkey,_historical)"] Democrat Party (DP), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Party_(Turkey)"] Justice Party (AP), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherland_Party_(Turkey)"] Motherland Party (ANAP)
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey)"] Justice and Development Party (AKP) once became the largest political party in Turkey. Turkish

 right-wing parties are more likely to embrace principles of political ideologies such as conservatism,
 nationalism or Islamism.[171] On the left side of the spectrum, parties like Republican People's Party (CHP), Social Democratic
Populist Party (SHP) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Left_Party_(Turkey)"] Democratic Left Party (DSP) once enjoyed the largest electoral success. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics"] Left-wing parties are more likely
to embrace principles of socialism, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kemalism"] Kemalism or secularism.[172]
The 12th [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Turkey"] President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo%C4%9Fan"] Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the winner of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Turkish_presidential_election"] 2018 presidential election and former [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Turkey"] prime minister, is currently

is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_Grand_National_Assembly"] Speaker of the Grand National Assembly.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/27th_Parliament_of_Turkey"] 27th Parliament of Turkey was installed following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Turkish_parliamentary_election"] 2018 parliamentary election, with the starting composition of 295 seats
 for the Justice and Development Party (AKP), 146 seats for the Republican People's Party (CHP), 67 seats for the Peoples'
Democratic Party (HDP), 49 seats for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Movement_Party"] Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) and 49 seats for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Party"] Good Party (İP).[173] The next
parliamentary election is scheduled to take place in 2023.
Law
 With the founding of the Republic, Turkey adopted a civil law legal system, replacing Sharia-derived Ottoman law. The Civil
Code, adopted in 1926, was based on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Civil_Code"] Swiss Civil Code of 1907 and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Code_of_Obligations"] Swiss Code of Obligations of 1911. Although it
underwent a number of changes in 2002, it retains much of the basis of the original Code. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code"] Criminal Code, originally based on
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_law_codes#Penal_Code"] Italian Criminal Code, was replaced in 2005 by a Code with principles similar to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Penal_Code"] German Penal Code and German law

generally. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_law"] Administrative law is based on the French equivalent and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_law"] procedural law
generally shows the influence of the Swiss, German and French legal systems.[174]
Islamic principles do not play a part in the legal system.[175]
Turkey has adopted the principle of the separation of powers. In line with this principle,
judicial power is exercised by independent courts on behalf of the Turkish nation. The
independence and organisation of the courts, the security of the tenure of judges and
public prosecutors, the profession of judges and prosecutors, the supervision of judges
and public prosecutors, the military courts and their organisation, and the powers and
duties of the high courts are regulated by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Constitution"] Turkish Constitution.[176]  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_%C3%87a%C4%9Flayan_Justice_Palace"] Istanbul Çağlayan Justice Palace is a

jurisdiction of the courts, their functions and the trial procedures are regulated by law. In
line with the aforementioned article of the Turkish Constitution and related laws, the
court system in Turkey can be classified under three main categories; which are the Judicial Courts, Administrative Courts, and
Military Courts. Each category includes first instance courts and high courts. In addition, the Court of Jurisdictional Disputes rules
on cases that cannot be classified readily as falling within the purview of one court system.[176]
 Law enforcement in Turkey is carried out by several agencies under the jurisdiction of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_the_Interior_(Turkey)"] Ministry of Internal Affairs. These
agencies are the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Directorate_of_Security_(Turkey)"] General Directorate of Security, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmerie_General_Command"] Gendarmerie General Command and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_Guard_Command_(Turkey)"] Coast Guard Command.
Furthermore, there are other law enforcement agencies with specific ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Intelligence_Organization_(Turkey)"] National Intelligence Organization, General Directorate of
Customs Protection, etc.) or local (Village guards, Municipal Police, etc.) assignments that are under the jurisdiction of the president
or different ministries.
In the years of government by the AKP and Erdoğan, particularly since 2013, the independence and integrity of the Turkish
judiciary has increasingly been said to be in doubt by institutions, parliamentarians and journalists both within and outside of
Turkey; due to political interference in the promotion of judges and prosecutors, and in their pursuit of public
duty.[177][178][179][180] The Turkey 2015 report of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"] European Commission stated that "the independence of the judiciary and
respect of the principle of separation of powers have been undermined and judges and prosecutors have been under strong political
pressure."[177]
Foreign relations
Turkey is a founding member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_and_the_United_Nations"] United Nations (1945),[181] the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD"] OECD (1961),[182]
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_Islamic_Cooperation"] OIC (1969),[183] the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_for_Security_and_Co-operation_in_Europe"] OSCE (1973),[184] the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Cooperation_Organization"] ECO (1985),[185] the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_of_the_Black_Sea_Economic_Cooperation"] BSEC (1992),[186]
 the D-8 (1997)[187] and the G20 (1999).[188] Turkey was a member of the United Nations
Security Council in 1951–1952, 1954–1955, 1961 and 2009–2010.[189] In 2012 Turkey
became a dialogue partner of the SCO, and in 2013 became a member of the
ACD.[190][191]
In line with its traditional Western orientation, relations with Europe have always been a
central part of Turkish foreign policy. Turkey became [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_the_Council_of_Europe"] one of the early members of the
Council of Europe in 1950, applied for associate membership of the EEC (predecessor of

political negotiations, Turkey applied for full membership of the EEC in 1987, became an
associate member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_European_Union"] Western European Union in 1992, joined the EU Customs Union
in 1995 and has been in formal accession negotiations with the EU since 2005.[149][150] 
 After becoming one of the early
members of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Europe"] Council of Europe in
 1950, Turkey became an associate
member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community"] EEC in 1963, joined
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_Customs_Union"] EU Customs Union in 1995 and

The other defining aspect of Turkey's foreign policy was the country's long-standing

strategic alliance with the United States.[193][194] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Doctrine"] Truman Doctrine in 1947 enunciated
 American intentions to guarantee the security of Turkey and Greece during the Cold War, and resulted in large-scale U.S. military
and economic support. In 1948 both countries were included in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan"] Marshall Plan and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_European_Economic_Co-operation"] OEEC for rebuilding European
economies.[195] The common threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War led to Turkey's membership of NATO in
1952, ensuring close bilateral relations with the US. Subsequently, Turkey benefited from the United States' political, economic and
diplomatic support, including in key issues such as the country's bid to join the European Union.[196] In the post–Cold War
environment, Turkey's geostrategic importance shifted towards its proximity to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East"] Middle East, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus"] Caucasus and the Balkans.[197]
The independence of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_states"] Turkic states of the Soviet Union in 1991, with which Turkey shares a common cultural and linguistic
heritage, allowed Turkey to extend its economic and political relations deep into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"] Central Asia,[199] thus enabling the completion of
a multi-billion-dollar oil and natural gas [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku%E2%80%93Tbilisi%E2%80%93Ceyhan_pipeline"] pipeline from Baku in Azerbaijan to the port of Ceyhan in Turkey. The Baku–Tbilisi–
Page 12
 Ceyhan pipeline forms part of Turkey's foreign policy strategy to become an energy conduit
from the Caspian Sea basin to Europe. However, in 1993, Turkey sealed its land border
with Armenia in a gesture of support to Azerbaijan (a Turkic state in the Caucasus region)
during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nagorno-Karabakh_War"] First Nagorno-Karabakh War, and it remains closed.[200] Armenia and Turkey
started diplomatic talks in order to normalise the relationship between the two countries.
The discussions include opening the closed borders and starting trade. Turkey and Armenia
have also restarted commercial flights between the two countries.[201]The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Armed_Forces"] Turkish Armed Forces

largest standing military force in
NATO, after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces"] US Armed Forces.
Turkey joined the alliance in
1952.[198] 
Under the AKP government, Turkey's influence has grown in the formerly Ottoman
territories of the Middle East and the Balkans, based on the "strategic depth" doctrine (a
terminology that was coined by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmet_Davuto%C4%9Flu"] Ahmet Davutoğlu for defining Turkey's increased
engagement in regional foreign policy issues),  also called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Ottomanism"] Neo-Ottomanism.[202][203]
Following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring"] Arab Spring in December 2010, the choices made by the AKP government
for supporting certain political opposition groups in the affected countries have led to
tensions with some Arab states, such as Turkey's neighbour Syria since the start of the
 Syrian civil war, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt"] Egypt after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Egyptian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"] ousting of President Mohamed Morsi.[204][205]
As of 2021, Turkey does not have an ambassador in either Syria or Egypt.[206] Diplomatic
relations with Israel were also severed after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid"] Gaza flotilla raid in 2010, but were
normalised following a deal in June 2016.[207] These political rifts have left Turkey with
few allies in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levant"] East Mediterranean, where rich [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas"] natural gas fields have recently been
discovered;[208][209] in sharp contrast with the original goals that were set by the former
Foreign Minister (later Prime Minister) Ahmet Davutoğlu in his "zero problems with
neighbours"[210][211] foreign policy doctrine.[212] In 2015, Turkey, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia"] Saudi Arabia and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar"] Qatar
formed a "strategic alliance" against Syrian President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bashar_al-Assad"] Bashar al-Assad.[213] However,
following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia%E2%80%93Turkey_relations#Normalisation_of_ties"] rapprochement with Russia in 2016, Turkey revised its stance regarding the
solution of the conflict in Syria.[214][215][216] In January 2018, the Turkish military and the

abroad,[232] with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_overseas_military_bases"] military bases in Albania,[233] Iraq,[234] Qatar,[235] and Somalia.[236] The country also maintains a force of
 36,000 troops in Northern Cyprus since 1974.[237]
Human rights
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Turkey"] human rights record of Turkey has been the subject of much controversy and
international condemnation. Between 1959 and 2011 the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Human_Rights"] European Court of Human Rights
made more than 2400 judgements against Turkey for human rights violations on issues such
as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_of_Kurdish_people_in_Turkey"] Kurdish rights, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Turkey"] women's rights, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Turkey"] LGBT rights, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_of_Turkey"] media freedom.[238][239] Turkey's
 human rights record continues to be a significant obstacle to the country's membership of
the EU.[240]
In the latter half of the 1970s, Turkey suffered from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence_in_Turkey_(1976%E2%80%931980)"] political violence between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics"] far-left and
 far-right militant groups, which culminated in the military coup of 1980.[241] The Kurdistan
Workers' Party - a.k.a. PKK - (designated a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_designated_terrorist_groups"] terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United

Kurdish militants led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_%C3%96calan"] Abdullah Öcalan, seeking the foundation of an independent Kurdish state based on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_state"] Marxist-Leninist
ideology.[243] The initial reason given by the PKK for this was the oppression of Kurds in Turkey.[244][245] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish%E2%80%93Turkish_conflict_(1978%E2%80%93present)"] A full-scale insurgency
began in 1984, when the PKK announced a Kurdish uprising. Following the arrest and imprisonment of Abdullah Öcalan in
1999,[146][147] the PKK modified its demands into equal rights for ethnic Kurds and provincial autonomy within
Turkey.[246][247][248][249] Since the conflict began, more than 40,000 people have died, most of whom were Turkish Kurds.[250]
The European Court of Human Rights and other international human rights organisations have condemned Turkey for human
rights abuses.[238][239] Many judgments are related to cases such as civilian deaths in aerial bombardments,[251] torturing,[252]
forced displacements,[253] destroyed villages,[254][255][256] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_arrest"] arbitrary arrests,[257] murdered and disappeared Kurdish journalists,
activists and politicians.[258]
On 20 May 2016, the Turkish parliament stripped almost a quarter of its members of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_immunity"] immunity from prosecution, including 101
deputies from the pro-Kurdish [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples%27_Democratic_Party_(Turkey)"] HDP and the main opposition [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_People%27s_Party_(Turkey)"] CHP party.[259] In reaction to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Turkish_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat_attempt"] failed coup attempt on 15 July
2016, over 160,000 judges, teachers, police and civil servants have been suspended or dismissed, 77,000 have been formally
arrested,[260][261] and 130 media organisations, including 16 television broadcasters and 45 newspapers,[262] have been closed by
the government of Turkey.[263] 160 journalists have been imprisoned.[264]
According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_to_Protect_Journalists"] Committee to Protect Journalists, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey)"] AKP government has waged one of
the world's biggest crackdowns on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_freedom_in_Turkey"] media freedom.[265][266] Many journalists have been
arrested using charges of "terrorism" and "anti-state activities" such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergenekon_(organization)"] Ergenekon and
 Balyoz cases, while thousands have been investigated on charges such as "denigrating
Turkishness" or "insulting Islam" in an effort to sow self-censorship.[265] In 2017, the CPJ
identified 81 jailed journalists in Turkey (including the editorial staff of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumhuriyet"] Cumhuriyet,
Turkey's oldest newspaper still in circulation), all directly held for their published work (the
country ranked first in the world in that year, with more journalists in prison than in Iran,
Eritrea or China);[266] while in 2015 Freemuse identified nine musicians imprisoned for
their work (ranking third after Russia and China).[267]

 During the October 2019 offensive into Syria, Turkish forces have been accused of war
crimes, such as targeting civilians with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_phosphorus"] white phosphorus and various other human rights violations.[268][269] Turkey has officially
rejected the claims.[270]
LGBT rights
 Homosexual activity is legal in Turkey.[272] However, LGBT people in Turkey face discrimination, harassment and even violence
from their relatives, neighbors, etc.[273] The Turkish authorities have carried out many discriminatory practices.[274][275][276]
Despite these, LGBT acceptance in Turkey is growing. In a survey conducted by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadir_Has_University"] Kadir Has University in Istanbul in 2016, 33% of
respondents said that LGBT people should have equal rights, which increased to 45% in 2020. Another survey by Kadir Has
University in 2018 found that the proportion of people who would not want a homosexual neighbour decreased from 55% in 2018
to 47% in 2019.[277][278] A poll by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos"] Ipsos in 2015 found that 27% of the Turkish public was in favor of legalizing same-sex
marriage and 19% supported [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_unions"] civil unions instead.[279]

of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 square miles) is in Asia and 23,764 square
kilometres (9,175 square miles) is in Europe.[283] The country is encircled by seas on three sides: the Aegean Sea to the west, the
Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Turkey also contains the Sea of Marmara in the northwest.[284]
 Turkey is divided into seven geographical regions: Marmara, Aegean, Black Sea, Central Anatolia, Eastern Anatolia, Southeastern
Anatolia and the Mediterranean. The uneven north Anatolian terrain running along the Black Sea resembles a long, narrow belt.
This region comprises approximately one-sixth of Turkey's total land area. As a general trend, the inland Anatolian plateau
becomes increasingly rugged as it progresses eastward.[284]Pamukkale terraces are made of travertine, a sedimentary rock

Climate 
The coastal areas of Turkey bordering the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas have
a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperate"] temperate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate"] Mediterranean climate, with hot, dry summers and mild to cool, wet
winters.[302] The coastal areas bordering the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea"] Black Sea have a temperate
 oceanic climate with warm, wet summers and cool to cold, wet winters.[302]
The Turkish Black Sea coast receives the most [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)"] precipitation and is the only
region of Turkey that receives high precipitation throughout the year.[302] The
 Köppen climate classification of Turkey 
eastern part of the Black Sea coast averages 2,200 millimetres (87 in) annually
which is the highest precipitation in the country.[302] The coastal areas bordering
the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a
transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate
oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer"] summers and cool to cold, wet winters.[302] Snow falls on the coastal areas of the
Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea almost every winter, but usually melts in no more than a few days.[302] However, snow is rare
in the coastal areas of the Aegean Sea and very rare in the coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea.[302] Winters on the Anatolian
plateau are especially severe. Temperatures of −30 °C to −40 °C (−22 °F to −40 °F) do occur in northeastern Anatolia, and snow
may lie on the ground for at least 120 days of the year, and during the entire year on the summits of the highest mountains. In
central Anatolia the temperatures can drop below −20 °C ( -4 °F) with the mountains being even colder.
Mountains close to the coast prevent Mediterranean influences from extending inland, giving the central Anatolian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plateau"] plateau of the
interior of Turkey a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_climate"] continental climate with sharply contrasting seasons.[302]
Economy
Turkey is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newly_industrialized_country"] newly industrialized country, with an upper-middle income economy, which is
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)"] twentieth-largest in the world by nominal GDP, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)"] eleventh-largest by PPP.
Turkey is one of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_7"] Emerging 7 countries. According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank"] World Bank estimates, Turkey's
GDP per capita by PPP is $32,278 in 2021,[8] and approximately 11.7% of Turks are at risk
of poverty or social exclusion as of 2019.[303] Unemployment in Turkey was 13.6% in
2019,[304] and the middle class population in Turkey rose from 18% to 41% of the
population between 1993 and 2010 according to the World Bank.[305] As of
September 2021, the foreign currency reserves of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_the_Republic_of_Turkey"] Turkish Central Bank were $74.9

billion (a 5.1% decrease compared to the previous month), while its official reserve assets
stood at $121.3 billion.[306] As of October 2021, the foreign currency deposits of the citizens and residents in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_banks_in_Turkey"] Turkish banks stood
at $234 billion, equivalent to around half of all deposits.[307][308] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union_%E2%80%93_Turkey_Customs_Union"] EU–Turkey Customs Union in 1995 led to an extensive
liberalisation of tariff rates, and forms one of the most important pillars of Turkey's foreign trade policy.[309]

 The automotive industry in Turkey is sizeable, and produced over 1.3 million motor vehicles in 2015, ranking as the 14th largest
producer in the world.[310] Turkish automotive companies like TEMSA, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otokar"] Otokar and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMC_(Turkey)"] BMC are among the world's largest van, bus
and truck manufacturers. Turkish [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipyard"] shipyards are highly regarded both for the production of chemical and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_tanker"] oil tankers up to 10,000
 dwt and also for their mega yachts.[311] Turkish brands like Beko and Vestel are among the largest producers of consumer
electronics and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_appliances"] home appliances in Europe, and invest a substantial amount of funds for research and development in new
technologies related to these fields.[312][313][314]
Other key sectors of the Turkish economy are banking, construction, home
appliances, electronics, textiles, oil refining, petrochemical products, food,
mining, iron and steel, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_industry"] machine industry. In 2004, it was estimated that
46 percent of total disposable income was received by the top 20 percent of
income earners, while the lowest 20 percent received only 6 percent.[315]
 Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Turkey reached 22.05 billion USD in
2007 and 19.26 billion USD in 2015, but has declined in recent years.[316] In
the economic crisis of 2016 it emerged that the huge debts incurred for
investment during the AKP government since 2002 had mostly been
consumed in construction, rather than invested in sustainable economic
growth.[317] In 2020, according to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Tracker"] Carbon Tracker, money was being wasted

Turkey has seen a growth in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_gaming_industry"] video gaming industry during the recent years. Many game developing companies founded and gained
investment from venture capitalists.

Tourism
 Tourism in Turkey has increased almost every year in the 21st century,[328]
 and is an important part of the economy. The Turkish Ministry of Culture and
Tourism currently promotes Turkish tourism under the project [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_Home"] Turkey Home.
Turkey is one of the world's top ten destination countries, with the highest
percentage of foreign visitors arriving from Europe; specially Germany and
Russia in recent years.[328] In 2019, Turkey [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tourism_rankings#Most_visited_destinations_by_international_tourist_arrivals"] ranked sixth in the world in
terms of the number of international tourist arrivals behind Italy, with 51.2
 million foreign tourists visiting the country.[329] Turkey has 19 UNESCO [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmaris"] Marmaris in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Riviera"] Turkish Riviera

According to the Address-Based Population Recording System of Turkey, the country's
population was 74.7 million people in 2011,[368] nearly three-quarters of whom lived in
 towns and cities. According to the 2011 estimate, the population is increasing by 1.35
percent each year. Turkey has an average population density of 97 people per km². People
within the 15–64 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_group"] age group constitute 67.4 percent of the total population; the 0–14 age
group corresponds to 25.3 percent; while senior citizens aged 65 years or older make up 7.3
percent.[369]
Article 66 of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Constitution"] Turkish Constitution defines a "Turk" as "anyone who is bound to the
Turkish state through the bond of citizenship"; therefore, the legal use of the term "Turkish"
as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship"] citizen of Turkey is different from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_group"] ethnic definition.[370] However approximately
70 to 80 percent of the country's citizens are ethnic Turks.[371][4] It is estimated that there
are at least 47 ethnic groups represented in Turkey.[372] Reliable data on the ethnic mix of
the population is not available, because Turkish census figures do not include statistics on
ethnicity.[373]
 Kurds are the largest non-Turkish ethnicity at anywhere from 12–25 per cent of the
population.[374][375] The exact figure remains a subject of dispute; according to Servet
Mutlu, "more often than not, these estimates reflect pro-Kurdish or pro-Turkish sympathies
 CIA map of areas with a Kurdish and attitudes rather than scientific facts or erudition".[372] Mutlu's 1990 study estimated
majority[367]  Kurds made up around 12 per cent of the population, while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehrdad_Izady"] Mehrdad Izady placed the
figure around 25 per cent.[376] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurds"] Kurds make up a majority in the provinces of Ağrı,
Batman, Bingöl, Bitlis, Diyarbakır, Hakkari, Iğdır, Mardin, Muş, Siirt, Şırnak, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunceli_Province"] Tunceli and
Van; a near majority in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Eanl%C4%B1urfa_Province"] Şanlıurfa Province (47%); and a large minority in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kars_Province"] Kars Province (20%).[377] In addition, due to internal
migration, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_diaspora"] Kurdish diaspora communities exist in all of the major cities in central and western Turkey. In Istanbul, there are an
estimated three million Kurds, making it the city with the largest Kurdish population in the world.[378] Non-Kurdish minorities are
believed to make up an estimated 7–12 percent of the population.[4]
The three "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millet_(Ottoman_Empire)"] Non-Muslim" minority groups recognised in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Lausanne"] Treaty of Lausanne were Armenians, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_in_Turkey"] Greeks and Jews. Other ethnic
groups include Albanians, Arabs, Assyrians, Bosniaks, Circassians, Georgians, Laz, Pomaks, and Roma.[4][379][380][381][382]
Turkey is also home to a Muslim community of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megleno-Romanians"] Megleno-Romanians.[383]
Before the start of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war"] Syrian civil war in 2011, the estimated number of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs_in_Turkey"] Arabs in Turkey varied from 1 million to more than 2
 million.[384] As of April 2020, there are 3.6 million Syrian refugees in Turkey, who are mostly Arabs but also include Syrian
Kurds, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Turkmen"] Syrian Turkmen, and other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_of_Syria"] ethnic groups of Syria. The vast majority of these are living in Turkey with temporary residence
 permits. The Turkish government has granted Turkish citizenship to refugees who have joined the Syrian National
Army.[385][386][387]

Religion 
Turkey is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_state"] secular state with no official [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion"] state religion; the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Constitution"] Turkish Constitution provides for
 freedom of religion and conscience.[394][395] A 2016 survey by Ipsos, interviewing 17,180
adults across 22 countries, found that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"] Islam was the dominant religion in Turkey, adhered to
by 82% of the total population; religiously unaffiliated people comprised 13% of the
population, while 2% were Christians.[396] According to a religiosity poll conducted in

governmental statistics specifying the religious beliefs of the Turkish people, nor is religious data recorded in the country's
census.[402] Academics suggest the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alevi"] Alevi population may be from 15 to 20 million, while the Alevi-Bektaşi Federation states that
there are around 25 million.[403][404] According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aksiyon"] Aksiyon magazine, the number of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelver"] Twelver [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_Islam"] Shias (excluding Alevis) is three

17.5% (three million followers) in a population of 16 million to 2.5% percent in the early
 20th century.[409] mainly as a result of the Armenian genocide, the population exchange
between Greece and Turkey,[410] and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_emigration"] emigration of Christians that began in the late
19th century and gained pace in the first quarter of the 20th century.[411] Today, there are
more than 120,000–320,000 people of various [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denominations"] Christian denominations,[412] representing
 less than 0.2% of Turkey's population,[413] including an estimated 80,000 Oriental
 Orthodox, 35,000 Roman Catholics,[414] 18,000 Antiochian Greeks,[415] 5,000 Greek
Orthodox, smaller numbers of Protestants,[416] and 512 Mormons.[417] Currently, there are
236 churches open for worship in Turkey.[418]
Modern-day Turkey continues to have a small Jewish population;[419] with around 26,000
 Jews, the vast majority of whom are Sephardi.[420] Turkey has the biggest Jewish

compulsory and lasts twelve years: four years each of primary school, middle school and
high school.[432] All 12 years compulsory education is free of charge in public
schools.[433]

As of 2017, there are 190 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_in_Turkey"] universities in Turkey.[435] Except for the Open Education
Faculties (AÖF) at Anadolu, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_University"] Istanbul and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atat%C3%BCrk_University"] Atatürk University; entrance is regulated by the

Turkey has become a hub for foreign students in recent years. The number of foreign
students in Turkey was 795.962 in 2016.[442] The government has announced a vision to
draw around 500,000 foreign students at its universities by offering attractive
scholarships.[443] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BCrkiye_Scholarships"] Türkiye Scholarships is international scholarship program funded by

Health
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Turkey)"] Ministry of Health has run a universal public healthcare system since 2003.[447]
Known as Universal Health Insurance (Genel Sağlık Sigortası), it is funded by a tax
surcharge on employers, currently at 5%.[447] Public-sector funding covers approximately
75.2% of health expenditures.[447] Despite the universal health care, total expenditure on
health as a share of GDP in 2018 was the lowest among OECD countries at 6.3% of GDP,
compared to the OECD average of 9.3%.[447] The lower health care expenditure is due to
lower median age in Turkey which is 32.4, compared to Italy which is 47.3.[448] Aging
population is the prime reason for higher healthcare expenditure in the developed
world.[449]

There are many private hospitals in the country. Turkey benefits from medical tourism in the recent years. Health tourism earns
above $1 billion to Turkey in 2019. Some 60% of the income is obtained from plastic surgery and a total of 662,087 patients
received service in the country last year within the scope of health tourism.[452]
Culture
Turkey has a very diverse culture that is a blend of various elements of the Turkic, Anatolian, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_Ottoman_Empire"] Ottoman (which was itself a
 continuation of both Greco-Roman and Islamic cultures) and Western culture and traditions, which started with the Westernisation
of the Ottoman Empire and still continues today.[453][454] This mix originally began as a result of the encounter of Turks and their
culture with those of the peoples who were in their path during [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_migration"] their migration from Central Asia to the West.[453][455] Turkish
culture is a product of efforts to be a "modern" Western state, while maintaining traditional religious and historical values.[453]

Visual arts
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_miniature"] Ottoman miniature is linked to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_miniature"] Persian miniature tradition, as well as strong [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_painting#Late_imperial_China_(1368%E2%80%931895)"] Chinese
artistic influences. The words tasvir or nakış were used to define the art of miniature
painting in Ottoman Turkish. The studios the artists worked in were called
nakkaşhane.[456] The miniatures were usually not signed, perhaps because of the rejection
of individualism, but also because the works were not created entirely by one person; the
head painter designed the composition of the scene, and his apprentices drew the contours
(which were called tahrir) with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature without
creating an illusion of depth. The head painter, and much more often the scribe of the text,
were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts. The understanding of
perspective was different from that of the nearby European Renaissance painting tradition,
and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one picture. They
followed closely the context of the book they were included in, more illustrations than
standalone works of art.[457] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrak%C3%A7%C4%B1_Nasuh"] Matrakçı Nasuh (1480–1564) is one of the most prominent
artists of this era.  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ortak%C3%B6y_Mosque"] Ortaköy Mosque is a good example
of the Westernisation of Islamic-
 Turkish painting, in the Western sense, developed actively starting from the mid 19th
 century. The first painting lessons were scheduled at what is now the Istanbul Technical
University (then the Imperial Military Engineering School) in 1793, mostly for technical
purposes.[458] In the late 19th century, human figure in the Western sense was being

Impressionism, among the contemporary trends, appeared later on with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halil_Pasha_(painter)"] Halil Pasha (c.1857–1939). Other important Turkish
painters in the 19th century were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferik_%C4%B0brahim_Pasha"] Ferik İbrahim Paşa (1815–1891), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osman_Nuri_Pasha_(painter)"] Osman Nuri Paşa (c.1839–1906), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Eeker_Ahmet_Pa%C5%9Fa"] Şeker Ahmet Paşa (1841–
1907), and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoca_Ali_Riza"] Hoca Ali Riza (1864–1939).

Other important movements in
Turkish painting were the "Yeniler
Grubu" (The Newcomers Group) of
the late 1930s; the "On'lar Grubu" (Group of Ten) of the 1940s; the "Yeni Dal Grubu" (New Branch Group) of the 1950s; and the
"Siyah Kalem Grubu" (Black Pen Group) of the 1960s.[459]

 Carpet (halı) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilim"] tapestry (kilim) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving"] weaving is a traditional Turkish art form with roots in pre-Islamic times. During its long history,
the art and craft of weaving carpets and tapestries in Turkey has integrated numerous cultural traditions. Apart from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_peoples"] Turkic
design patterns that are prevalent, traces of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_carpet"] Persian and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_silk#Tapestry_and_embroidery"] Byzantine patterns can also be detected. There are also similarities with the
patterns used in Armenian, Caucasian and Kurdish carpet designs. The arrival of Islam in Central Asia and the development of
 Islamic art also influenced Turkic patterns in the medieval period. The history of the designs, motifs and ornaments used in Turkish
carpets and tapestries thus reflects the political and ethnic history of the Turks and the cultural diversity of Anatolia. However,
scientific attempts were unsuccessful, as yet, to attribute a particular design to a specific ethnic, regional, or even nomadic versus
village tradition.[460]
The earliest examples of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_paper_marbling"] Turkish paper marbling, called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_marbling"] ebru in Turkish, are said to be a copy of the Hâlnâme by the poet Arifî.
The text of this manuscript was rendered in a delicate cut paper découpage calligraphy by Mehmed bin Gazanfer and completed in
1540, and features many marbled and decorative paper borders. One early master by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym"] pseudonym of Şebek is mentioned
posthumously in the earliest Ottoman text on the art known as the Tertib-i Risâle-i Ebrî, which is dated based on internal evidence
to after 1615. The instructions for several ebru techniques in the text are accredited to this master. Another famous 18th-century
Page 22
master by the name of Hatip Mehmed Efendi (died 1773) is accredited with developing
motifs and perhaps early floral designs, although evidence from India appears to contradict
some of these reports. Despite this, marbled motifs are commonly referred to as hatip
designs in Turkey today.[462]
Literature and theatre 
 Turkish literature is a mix of cultural influences. Interaction
between the Ottoman Empire and the Islamic world along
with Europe contributed to a blend of Turkic, Islamic and
European traditions in modern-day Turkish music and
literary arts.[465] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_literature"] Turkish literature was heavily influenced

 Namık Kemal's works had a
profound influence on
 Atatürk and other Turkish
statesmen who established
the Turkish
Republic.[463][464] 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzimat"] Tanzimat reforms of the 19th century introduced previously unknown Western genres,
primarily the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel"] novel and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story"] short story. Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several
genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namik_Kemal"] Nâmık Kemal also wrote the important 1876 novel
İntibâh (Awakening), while the journalist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0brahim_%C5%9Einasi"] Şinasi has written, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play,
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_act_play"] one-act comedy "Şair Evlenmesi" (The Poet's Marriage). Most of the roots of modern Turkish
literature were formed between the years 1896 and 1923. Broadly, there were three primary literary
movements during this period: the Edebiyat-ı Cedîde (New Literature) movement; the Fecr-i Âtî
(Dawn of the Future) movement; and the Millî Edebiyat (National Literature) movement.
The first radical step of innovation in 20th century Turkish
poetry was taken by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A2z%C4%B1m_Hikmet_Ran"] Nâzım Hikmet, who introduced the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_verse"] free verse style. Another
 revolution in Turkish poetry came about in 1941 with the Garip movement led by Orhan
Veli, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktay_R%C4%B1fat_Horozcu"] Oktay Rıfat and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melih_Cevdet_Anday"] Melih Cevdet. The mix of cultural influences in Turkey is dramatised,
for example, in the form of the "new symbols of the clash and interlacing of cultures"
enacted in the novels of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orhan_Pamuk"] Orhan Pamuk, recipient of the 2006 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature"] Nobel Prize in Literature.[466]
The origin of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_theatre"] Turkish theatre dates back to ancient pagan rituals and oral legends. The
dances, music and songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of Anatolia
millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated. In time, the ancient
rituals, myths, legends and stories evolved into theatrical shows. Starting from the 11th-
century, the traditions of the Seljuk Turks blended with those of the indigenous peoples of
Anatolia and the interaction between diverse cultures paved the way for new plays.

After the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzimat"] Tanzimat (Reformation) period in the 19th century, characters in Turkish theatre
were modernised and plays were performed on European-style stages, with actors wearing
 European costumes. Following the restoration of constitutional monarchy with the Young
Turk Revolution in 1908, theatrical activities increased and social problems began to be
 reflected at the theatre as well as in historical plays. A theatrical conservatoire, Darülbedayi-
i Osmani (which became the nucleus of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_City_Theatres"] Istanbul City Theatres) was established in
1914. During the years of chaos and war, the Darülbedayi-i Osmani continued its activities
and attracted the younger generation. Numerous Turkish playwrights emerged in this era;
some of them wrote on romantic subjects, while others were interested in social problems,
and still others dealt with nationalistic themes. The first Turkish musicals were also written
in this period. In time, Turkish women began to appear on stage, which was an important
development in the late Ottoman society. Until then, female roles had only been played by
actresses who were members of Turkey's ethnic minorities. Today there are numerous
private theatres in the country, together with those which are subsidised by the government,
such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_State_Theatres"] Turkish State Theatres.[467]

music, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_music"] Greek music, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_music"] Ottoman music, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_traditional_music"] Persian music and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Southeastern_Europe"] Balkan music, as well as references to more modern European and
 American [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music"] popular music. The roots of traditional music in Turkey span across centuries to a time when the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuk_Turks"] Seljuk Turks migrated to
 Anatolia and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia"] Persia in the 11th century and contains elements of both Turkic and pre-Turkic influences. Much of its modern
popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the early 1930s drive for Westernization.[469]

With the assimilation of immigrants from various regions the diversity of musical genres
and musical instrumentation also expanded. Turkey has also seen documented folk music
and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of Greek, Armenian, Albanian,
 Polish and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish"] Jewish communities, among others.[470]
Many Turkish cities and towns have vibrant local music scenes which, in turn, support a
 number of regional musical styles. Despite this however, western music styles like pop
music and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanto_(music)"] kanto lost popularity to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabesque"] arabesque in the late 1970s and 1980s. It became popular
again by the beginning of the 1990s, as a result of an opening economy and society. With
the support of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sezen_Aksu"] Sezen Aksu, the resurging popularity of pop music gave rise to several
international Turkish pop stars such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajda_Pekkan"] Ajda Pekkan, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarkan_(singer)"] Tarkan and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sertab_Erener"] Sertab Erener.

Architecture
The Byzantine era is usually dated from 330 AD, when Constantine the Great moved the Roman capital to Byzantium, which
became Constantinople, until the fall of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire"] Byzantine Empire in 1453. Its architecture dramatically influenced the later medieval
architecture throughout Europe and the Near East, and became the primary progenitor of the Renaissance and Ottoman
architectural traditions that followed its collapse.[473] When the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire"] Roman Empire went Christian (as well as Eastwards) with its new
capital at Constantinople, its architecture became more sensuous and more ambitious. This new style would come to be known as
Byzantine with increasingly exotic domes and ever-richer mosaics, traveled west to Ravenna and Venice and as far north as
Moscow.[474]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuk_architecture"] architecture of the Seljuk Turks combined the elements and characteristics of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Central_Asia"] Turkic architecture of Central Asia with those
of Persian, Arab, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_architecture"] Armenian and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_architecture"] Byzantine architecture. The transition from Seljuk architecture to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_architecture"] Ottoman architecture is most
 visible in Bursa, which was the capital of the Ottoman State between 1335 and 1413. Following the Ottoman conquest of
Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1453, Ottoman architecture was significantly influenced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_architecture"] Byzantine architecture. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topkap%C4%B1_Palace"] Topkapı Palace in
 Istanbul is one of the most famous examples of classical Ottoman architecture and was the primary residence of the Ottoman
Sultans for approximately 400 years.[475] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimar_Sinan"] Mimar Sinan (c.1489–1588) was the most important architect of the classical period in
 Ottoman architecture. He was the chief architect of at least 374 buildings that were constructed in various provinces of the Ottoman
Empire in the 16th century.[476] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedefkar_Mehmed_Agha"] Sedefkar Mehmed Agha also known as the architect of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mosque,_Istanbul"] Blue Mosque was an Albanian origin
Devshirme. He became a pupil of architect Mimar Sinan, becoming his first assistant in charge of the office in the absence of Sinan.
His work heavily influenced by his teacher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimar_Sinan"] Mimar Sinan
Since the 18th century, Turkish architecture has been increasingly influenced by European styles, and this can be particularly seen
in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzimat"] Tanzimat era buildings of Istanbul like the Dolmabahçe, Çırağan, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taksim_Military_Barracks"] Taksim Military Barracks (demolished), Feriye, Beylerbeyi,
Küçüksu, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ihlamur_Palace"] Ihlamur and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%C4%B1ld%C4%B1z_Palace"] Yıldız palaces, which were all designed by members of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balyan_family"] Balyan family of Ottoman Armenian court
architects.[477] The Ottoman era [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yal%C4%B1"] waterfront houses (yalı) on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosphorus"] Bosphorus also reflect the fusion between classical Ottoman and
European architectural styles during the aforementioned period. Italian architect, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raimondo_D%27Aronco"] Raimondo D'Aronco served as the chief palace
architect to the Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamid II in Istanbul for 16 years. D'Aronco designed and built a large number of buildings of
various types in Istanbul. The stylistic features of his works can be classified in three groups: Revivalism, reinterpretation of the
Ottoman forms, Art Nouveau and Vienna Secession. Art Nouveau was first introduced to Istanbul by D'Aronco, and his designs
reveal that he drew freely on Byzantine and Ottoman decorations. He also mixed Western and Oriental styles in his work.

The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_National_Architectural_Movement"] First National Architectural Movement in the early 20th century sought to create a new
architecture, which was based on motifs from Seljuk and Ottoman architecture. The leading
architects of this movement were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedat_Tek"] Vedat Tek (1873–1942), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimar_Kemaleddin_Bey"] Mimar Kemaleddin Bey (1870–
1927),  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arif_Hikmet_Koyuno%C4%9Flu"] Arif Hikmet Koyunoğlu (1888–1982) and Giulio Mongeri (1873–1953).[478]
 Buildings from this era are the Grand Post Office in Istanbul (1905–1909),  Tayyare
 Apartments (1919–1922),[479] Istanbul 4th Vakıf Han (1911–1926),[480] State Art and

Cuisine
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_cuisine"] Turkish cuisine is largely the heritage of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_cuisine"] Ottoman cuisine. In the early years of the Republic, a
few studies were published about regional Anatolian dishes but cuisine did not feature heavily
in Turkish folkloric studies until the 1980s, when the fledgling tourism industry encouraged
the Turkish state to sponsor two food symposia. The papers submitted at the symposia
presented the history of Turkish cuisine on a "historical continuum" that dated back to Turkic
origins in Central Asia and continued through the Seljuk and Ottoman periods.[492] 
 Çırağan Palace (1867) in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul"] Istanbul
Many of the papers presented at these first two symposia were unreferenced. Prior to the
symposia, the study of Turkish culinary culture was first popularised by the publication of
Süheyl Ünver's Fifty Dishes in Turkish History in 1948. This book was based on recipes
found in an 18th century Ottoman manuscript. His second book was about palace cuisine
during the reign of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmet_II"] Mehmet II. Following the publication of Ünver's book subsequent studies
 were published, including a 1978 study by a historian named Bahaettin Ögel about the Central
Asian origins of Turkish cuisine.[492]
 Ottoman cuisine contains elements of Turkish, Byzantine, Balkan, Armenian, Kurdish, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_cuisine"] Arab
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_cuisine"] Persian cuisines.[493] The country's  position between Europe, Asia, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul_Main_Post_Office"] Grand Post Office (1909) in
Mediterranean Sea helped the Turks in gaining complete control of the major [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_route"] trade routes, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul"] Istanbul
an ideal landscape and climate allowed plants and animals to flourish. Turkish cuisine was
well established by the mid-1400s, the beginning of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire"] Ottoman Empire's six hundred-year
reign. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogurt"] Yogurt salads, fish in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_oil"] olive oil, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharbat"] sherbet and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolma"] stuffed and wrapped vegetables became
Turkish staples. The empire, eventually spanning from Austria and Ukraine to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabia"] Arabia and
North Africa, used its land and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the
world. By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman court housed over 1,400 live-in cooks and
passed laws regulating the freshness of food. Since the fall of the empire in World War I (1914–1918) and the establishment of the
Turkish Republic in 1923, foreign food such as French hollandaise sauce and Western fast food have made their way into the
modern Turkish diet.[494]
