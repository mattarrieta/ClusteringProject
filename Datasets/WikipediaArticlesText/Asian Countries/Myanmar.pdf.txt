Myanmar,[a] officially the Republic of the
Union of Myanmar (Burmese: ပြည်ထောင်စု
 သမ္မတ မြန်မာနိုင်ငံတေ; pronounced  [pjìdàʊɴzṵ
θàɴməda̰ mjəmà nàɪɴŋàɴdɔ̀]), also known as
Burma, is a country in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"] Southeast Asia. It is the
largest country in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_Southeast_Asia"] Mainland Southeast Asia, and
has a population of about 54 million as of 2017.[7]
Myanmar is bordered by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh"] Bangladesh and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"] India to
its northwest, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"] China to its northeast, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos"] Laos and
 Thailand to its east and southeast, and the
 Andaman Sea and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal"] Bay of Bengal to its south
and southwest. The country's capital city is
Naypyidaw, and its largest city is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon"] Yangon
(Rangoon).[3]
 Early civilisations in the area included the Tibeto-
 Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper
 Myanmar and the Mon kingdoms in Lower
 Myanmar.[11] In the 9th century, the Bamar
people entered the upper [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrawaddy_River"] Irrawaddy valley, and
 following the establishment of the Pagan
Kingdom in the 1050s, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_language"] Burmese language,
culture, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada"] Theravada [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_Myanmar"] Buddhism slowly became
dominant in the country. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagan_Kingdom"] Pagan Kingdom fell
to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Mongol_invasion_of_Burma"] Mongol invasions, and several warring states
emerged. In the 16th century, reunified by the
 Taungoo dynasty, the country became the largest
empire in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Southeast_Asia"] history of Southeast Asia for a short
period.[12]
The early 19th-century [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konbaung_dynasty"] Konbaung dynasty ruled
over an area that included modern Myanmar and
briefly controlled [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipur"] Manipur and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assam"] Assam as well.
The British [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company"] East India Company seized control of
 the administration of Myanmar after three Anglo-
Burmese Wars in the 19th century, and the
country became a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_rule_in_Burma"] British colony. After a brief
 Japanese occupation, Myanmar was reconquered
by the Allies and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(Myanmar)"] gained independence in 1948.
Following a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962_Burmese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"] coup d'état in 1962, it became a
 military dictatorship under the Burma Socialist
Programme Party.

For most of its independent years, the country has
 been engrossed in rampant ethnic strife and its
myriad ethnic groups have been involved in one
of the world's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_conflict_in_Myanmar"] longest-running ongoing civil wars.
During this time, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"] United Nations and several
other organisations have reported consistent and
systemic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Myanmar"] human rights violations in the
country.[13] In 2011, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Peace_and_Development_Council"] military junta was
 officially dissolved following a 2010 general
election, and a nominally civilian government was
 installed. This, along with the release of Aung
San Suu Kyi and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_prisoner"] political prisoners and
successful [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Myanmar_general_election"] elections in 2015, improved the
country's  human rights record and foreign
relations and led to the easing of trade and other
 economic sanctions,[14] although the country's
treatment of its ethnic minorities, particularly in
connection with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_conflict"] Rohingya conflict, continued
to be condemned by international organizations
and many nations.[15]
Following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Myanmar_general_election"] 2020 Myanmar general election, in
which [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"] Aung San Suu Kyi's party won a clear
 majority in both houses, the Burmese military
 (Tatmadaw) again seized power in a coup
d'état.[16] The coup, which was widely
 condemned, led to continuous ongoing
widespread protests in Myanmar and has been
marked by violent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression"] political repression by the
 military.[17] The military also arrested Aung San
Suu Kyi and charged her with crimes ranging
from corruption to the violation of Covid
protocols, all of which have been labeled as
"politically motivated" by independent observers,
in order to remove her from public life.[18]
Myanmar is a member of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia_Summit"] East Asia Summit,
 Non-Aligned Movement, ASEAN, and
BIMSTEC, but it is not a member of the
 Commonwealth of Nations despite once being
part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire"] British Empire. It is a country rich in
 jade and gems, oil, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas"] natural gas, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teak_in_Myanmar"] teak and other
 mineral resources. Myanmar is also endowed with
 renewable energy; it has the highest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power"] solar power
potential compared to other countries of the Great
 Mekong Subregion.[19] In 2013, its GDP
(nominal) stood at US$56.7 billion and its GDP
(PPP) at US$221.5 billion.[20] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality"] income gap in
Myanmar is among the widest in the world, as a
large proportion of the economy is controlled by
 cronies of the military junta.[21] As of 2020,

Etymology
The name of the country has been a matter of dispute and disagreement, particularly in the early 21st
century, focusing mainly on the political legitimacy of those using Myanmar versus Burma.[22][23] Both
names derive from the earlier [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_language"] Burmese Mranma or Mramma, an ethnonym for the majority [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamar_people"] Burman ethnic
group, of uncertain etymology.[24] The terms are also popularly thought to derive from Brahma Desha or
ब्रह्मादेश/ब्रह्मावर्त (Sanskrit) after Brahma.[25]
In 1989, the military government [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_renamed_places_in_Myanmar"] officially changed the English translations of many names dating back to
 Burma's colonial period or earlier, including that of the country itself: Burma became Myanmar.  The
renaming remains a contested issue.[26] Many political and ethnic opposition groups and countries continue
to use Burma because they do not recognise the legitimacy of the ruling military government or its authority
to rename the country.[27]
In April 2016, soon after taking office, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"] Aung San Suu Kyi commented on the question of which name
should be used and said that "it is up to you because there is nothing in the constitution of our country that
says that you must use any term in particular". She continued, "I use Burma very often because I am used
to using it. But it does not mean that I require other people to do that as well. And I'll make an effort to say
Myanmar from time to time so you all feel comfortable."[28]
The country's official full name is "Republic of the Union of Myanmar" (ပြည်ထောင်စုသမ္မတ မြန်မာနိုင်ငံ
 တော်,  Pyihtaungsu Thamada Myanma Naingngantaw,  pronounced  [pjìdàʊɴzṵ θàɴməda̰ mjəmà
nàɪɴŋàɴdɔ̀]). Countries that do not officially recognise that name use the long form "Union of Burma"
Page 5
instead.[3][29] In English, the country is popularly known as either Burma or Myanmar. In Burmese, the
pronunciation depends on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_(sociolinguistics)"] register used and is either Bama (pronounced  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Burmese"] [bəmà]) or Myamah
(pronounced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Burmese"] [mjəmà]).[26] The name Burma has been in use in English since the 18th century.
Official United States policy retains Burma as the country's name although the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State"] State Department's website
lists the country as Burma (Myanmar).[30] The CIA's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Factbook"] World Factbook lists the country as Burma as of
February 2021.[3] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada"] government of Canada has in the past used Burma,[31] such as in its 2007 legislation
imposing sanctions[32] but as of August 2020 generally uses Myanmar.[33] The Czech Republic officially
uses Myanmar, although its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Czech_Republic)"] Ministry of Foreign Affairs uses both Myanmar and Burma on its website.[34]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"] United Nations uses Myanmar, as does the ASEAN and as do Australia,[35] Russia, Germany,[36]
China, India, Bangladesh, Norway,[37] Japan[31] and Switzerland.[38] Most English-speaking international
news media refer to the country by the name Myanmar, including the BBC,[39] CNN,[40] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera"] Al Jazeera,[41]
Reuters,[42] and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation"] Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)/[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Australia"] Radio Australia.[43]
Myanmar is known by a name deriving from Burma as opposed to Myanmar in Spanish, Italian,
Romanian, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language"] Greek – Birmania being the local version of Burma in both Italian and Spanish, Birmânia
in Portuguese, and Birmanie in French.[44] As in the past, French-language media today consistently use
Birmanie.[45][46]
There is no established pronunciation of the English name Myanmar,  and at least nine different
pronunciations exist. Those with two syllables are listed as more common by major UK and US
dictionaries except Collins: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˌmjænˈmɑːr/, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈmjænmɑːr/, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˌmjɑːnˈmɑːr/ (  listen), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈmjɑːnmɑːr/. Dictionaries
and other sources also report pronunciations with three syllables [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈmiːənmɑːr/,  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /miˈænmɑːr/,
 /ˌmaɪənˈmɑːr/, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /maɪˈɑːnmɑːr/, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ˈmaɪænmɑːr/.[47]
Wikipedia's IPA conventions require indicating /r/ even in British English although only some British
English speakers pronounce r at the end of syllables. As [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Wells"] John Wells explains, the English spellings of both
Myanmar and Burma assume a non-rhotic variety of English, in which the letter r before a consonant or
finally serves merely to indicate a long vowel: [ˈmjænmɑː, ˈbɜːmə]. So the pronunciation of the last
syllable of Myanmar as [mɑːr] or of Burma as [bɜːrmə] by some speakers in the UK and all in North
America is in fact a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling_pronunciation"] spelling pronunciation based on a misunderstanding of non-rhotic spelling conventions.
The final r in Myanmar was not intended for pronunciation and is there to ensure that the final a is
pronounced with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_a"] broad ah ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ɑː/) in "father". If the Burmese name မြန်မာ [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Burmese"] [mjəmà] were spelled
"Myanma" in English, this would be pronounced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ə/ at the end by all English speakers. If it were spelled
"Myanmah", the end would be pronounced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ɑː/ by all English speakers.
History
Prehistory
Archaeological evidence shows that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus"] Homo erectus lived in the region now known as Myanmar as early as
 750,000 years ago, with no more erectus finds after 75,000 years ago.[48] The first evidence of Homo
sapiens is dated to about 25,000 BP with discoveries of stone tools in central Myanmar.[49] Evidence of
 Neolithic age domestication of plants and animals and the use of polished stone tools dating to sometime
between 10,000 and 6,000 BCE has been discovered in the form of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_painting"] cave paintings in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padah-Lin_Caves"] Padah-Lin Caves.[50]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age"] Bronze Age arrived c. 1500 BCE when people in the region were turning copper into bronze, growing
rice and domesticating poultry and pigs; they were among the first people in the world to do so.[51] Human
remains and artefacts from this era were discovered in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monywa_District"] Monywa District in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagaing_Region"] Sagaing Region.[52] The
 Iron Age began around 500 BCE with the emergence of iron-working settlements in an area south of
Page 6
present-day Mandalay.[53] Evidence also shows the presence of
rice-growing settlements of large villages and small towns that
traded with their surroundings as far as China between 500 BCE
and 200 CE.[54] Iron Age Burmese cultures also had influences
from outside sources such as India and Thailand, as seen in their
funerary practices concerning child burials. This indicates some
form of communication between groups in Myanmar and other
places, possibly through trade.[55]
Early city-states
Around the second century BCE the first-known [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state"] city-states
emerged in central Myanmar. The city-states were founded as part
of the southward migration by the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu
people, the earliest inhabitants of Myanmar of whom records are
extant, from present-day Yunnan.[56] The Pyu culture was heavily
influenced by trade with India, importing Buddhism as well as
other cultural, architectural and political concepts, which would
have an enduring influence on later Burmese culture and political
organisation.[57]
By the 9th century, several city-states had sprouted across the land:
the Pyu in the central dry zone, Mon along the southern coastline
and Arakanese along the western littoral. The balance was upset
when the Pyu came under repeated attacks from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanzhao"] Nanzhao between
 the 750s and the 830s. In the mid-to-late 9th century the Bamar
people founded a small settlement at Bagan. It was one of several
competing city-states until the late 10th century, when it grew in
authority and grandeur.[58] 
 Pyu city-states, c. 8th century;
 Pagan is shown for comparison only
and is not contemporary.
Pagan Kingdom
 Pagan gradually grew to absorb its surrounding states until the
1050s–1060s when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anawrahta"] Anawrahta founded the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagan_Kingdom"] Pagan Kingdom, the
first ever unification of the Irrawaddy valley and its periphery. In
 the 12th and 13th centuries, the Pagan Empire and the Khmer
Empire were two main powers in mainland Southeast Asia.[59] The
 Burmese language and culture gradually became dominant in the
upper Irrawaddy valley, eclipsing the Pyu, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mon_language"] Mon and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali"] Pali norms by
the late 12th century.[60] Theravada [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism"] Buddhism slowly began to
spread to the village level, although Tantric, Mahayana, Hinduism,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_folk_religion"] folk religion remained heavily entrenched. Pagan's rulers and
wealthy built over 10,000 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism"] Buddhist temples in the Pagan capital
zone alone. Repeated Mongol invasions in the late 13th century
toppled the four-century-old kingdom in 1287.[60] 
 Pagodas and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyaung"] kyaungs in present-day
 Bagan, the capital of the Pagan
Kingdom
Pagan's collapse was followed by 250 years of political fragmentation that lasted well into the 16th century.
Like the Burmans four centuries earlier, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_people"] Shan migrants who arrived with the Mongol invasions stayed
behind. Several competing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_States"] Shan States came to dominate the entire northwestern to eastern arc surrounding
the Irrawaddy valley. The valley too was beset with petty states until the late 14th century when two
Page 7
sizeable powers, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Ava"] Ava Kingdom and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanthawaddy_Kingdom"] Hanthawaddy Kingdom,
emerged. In the west, a politically fragmented Arakan was under
 competing influences of its stronger neighbours until the Kingdom
of Mrauk U unified the Arakan coastline for the first time in 1437.
The kingdom was a protectorate of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_Sultanate"] Bengal Sultanate at different
time periods.[61]
In the 14th and 15th centuries, Ava fought [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty_Years%27_War"] wars of unification but
could never quite reassemble the lost empire. Having held off Ava,
the Mon-speaking Hanthawaddy entered its golden age, and 
Temples at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrauk_U"] Mrauk U.
Arakan went on to become a power in its own right for the next
350 years. In contrast, constant warfare left Ava greatly weakened, and it slowly disintegrated from 1481
onward. In 1527, the Confederation of Shan States conquered Ava and ruled Upper Myanmar until 1555.
Like the Pagan Empire, Ava, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bago,_Myanmar"] Hanthawaddy and the Shan states were all [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiracial_people"] multi-ethnic polities. Despite the
wars, cultural synchronisation continued. This period is considered a golden age for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Myanmar"] Burmese culture.
 Burmese literature "grew more confident, popular, and stylistically diverse", and the second generation of
Burmese law codes as well as the earliest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_chronicles"] pan-Burma chronicles emerged.[62] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bago,_Myanmar"] Hanthawaddy monarchs
introduced religious reforms that later spread to the rest of the country.[63] Many splendid temples of Mrauk
U were built during this period.
Taungoo and Konbaung
Political unification returned in the mid-16th century, through the
efforts of Taungoo, a former vassal state of Ava. Taungoo's young,
ambitious King [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabinshwehti"] Tabinshwehti defeated the more powerful
Hanthawaddy in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toungoo%E2%80%93Hanthawaddy_War_(1534%E2%80%931541)"] Toungoo–Hanthawaddy War. His successor
 Bayinnaung went on to conquer a vast swath of mainland
 Southeast Asia including the Shan states, Lan Na, Manipur, Mong
Mao, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayutthaya_Kingdom"] Ayutthaya Kingdom, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lan_Xang"] Lan Xang and southern Arakan.
However, the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia
unravelled soon after Bayinnaung's death in 1581, completely
collapsing by 1599. Ayutthaya seized Tenasserim and Lan Na, and
Portuguese mercenaries established [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire"] Portuguese rule at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanlyin"] Thanlyin
(Syriam).
The dynasty regrouped and defeated the Portuguese in 1613 and
Siam in 1614. It restored a smaller, more manageable kingdom,
 encompassing Lower Myanmar, Upper Myanmar, Shan states, Lan 
 Toungoo Empire under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayinnaung"] Bayinnaung in

Na and upper Tenasserim. The restored Toungoo kings created a
legal and political framework whose basic features continued well into the 19th century. The crown
completely replaced the hereditary chieftainships with appointed governorships in the entire Irrawaddy
valley and greatly reduced the hereditary rights of Shan chiefs. Its trade and secular administrative reforms
built a prosperous economy for more than 80 years. From the 1720s onward, the kingdom was beset with
repeated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meitei_people"] Meithei raids into Upper Myanmar and a nagging rebellion in Lan Na. In 1740, the Mon of Lower
Myanmar founded the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restored_Hanthawaddy_Kingdom"] Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom. Hanthawaddy forces sacked Ava in 1752, ending
the 266-year-old Toungoo Dynasty.
After the fall of Ava, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konbaung%E2%80%93Hanthawaddy_War"] Konbaung–Hanthawaddy War involved one resistance group under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaungpaya"] Alaungpaya
defeating the Restored Hanthawaddy, and by 1759 he had reunited all of Myanmar and Manipur and
driven out the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"] French and the British, who had provided arms to Hanthawaddy. By 1770, Alaungpaya's
Page 8
heirs had subdued much of Laos and fought and won the
 Burmese–Siamese War against Ayutthaya and the Sino-Burmese
War against [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty"] Qing China.[64]
With Burma preoccupied by the Chinese threat, Ayutthaya
recovered its territories by 1770 and went on to capture Lan Na by
1776. Burma and Siam went to war until 1855, but all resulted in a
stalemate, exchanging [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenasserim_Island"] Tenasserim (to Burma) and Lan Na (to
Ayutthaya).  Faced with a powerful China and a resurgent
Ayutthaya in the east, King [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodawpaya"] Bodawpaya turned west, acquiring
Arakan (1785),  Manipur (1814) and Assam (1817). It was the
second-largest empire in Burmese history but also one with a long
ill-defined border with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidencies_and_provinces_of_British_India"] British India.[65]

The breadth of this empire was short-lived. In 1826, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma_campaign"] Burma lost
 Arakan, Manipur, Assam and Tenasserim to the British in the First
Anglo-Burmese War. In 1852, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire"] British easily seized Lower Burma in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Anglo-Burmese_War"] Second Anglo-Burmese War.
King [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindon_Min"] Mindon Min tried to modernise the kingdom and in 1875 narrowly avoided annexation by ceding the
 Karenni States. The British, alarmed by the consolidation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Indochina"] French Indochina, annexed the remainder of
the country in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Anglo-Burmese_War"] Third Anglo-Burmese War in 1885.
Konbaung kings extended Restored Toungoo's administrative reforms and achieved unprecedented levels
of internal control and external expansion. For the first time in history, the Burmese language and culture
came to predominate the entire Irrawaddy valley. The evolution and growth of Burmese literature and
theatre continued, aided by an extremely high adult male literacy rate for the era (half of all males and 5%
of females).[66] Nonetheless, the extent and pace of reforms were uneven and ultimately proved insufficient
to stem the advance of British colonialism.
British Burma (1885–1948)
In the 19th century, Burmese rulers, whose country had not
previously been of particular interest to European traders, sought to
maintain their traditional influence in the western areas of Assam,
 Manipur and Arakan. Pressing them, however, was the British East
India Company, which was expanding its interests eastwards over
the same territory. Over the next sixty years, diplomacy, raids,
 treaties and compromises, known collectively as the Anglo-
Burmese Wars, continued until [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"] Britain proclaimed control over
most of Burma.[67] With the fall of Mandalay, all of Burma came
under British rule, being [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Anglo-Burmese_War#Annexation_and_resistance"] annexed on 1 January 1886. 
The landing of British forces in
 Mandalay after the last of the Anglo-
Throughout the colonial era, many Indians arrived as soldiers, civil
servants, construction workers and traders and, along with the
 Anglo-Burmese community, dominated commercial and civil life in 
Burmese Wars, which resulted in the
abdication of the last Burmese
monarch, King [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thibaw_Min"] Thibaw Min
Burma. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon"] Rangoon became the capital of British Burma and an
important port between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata"] Calcutta and Singapore. Burmese resentment was strong, and was vented in violent
riots that paralysed Rangoon on occasion until the 1930s.[68] Some of the discontent was caused by a
disrespect for Burmese culture and traditions such as the British refusal to remove shoes when they entered
pagodas. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhikkhu"] Buddhist monks became the vanguards of the independence movement. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_Wisara"] U Wisara, an activist
monk, died in prison after a 166-day hunger strike to protest against a rule that forbade him to wear his
Buddhist robes while imprisoned.[69]

On 1 April 1937, Burma became a separately administered colony
of Great Britain, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba_Maw"] Ba Maw became the first Prime Minister and
Premier of Burma. Ba Maw was an outspoken advocate for
Burmese self-rule, and he opposed the participation of Great
Britain, and by extension Burma, in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"] World War II. He resigned
from the Legislative Assembly and was arrested for sedition. In
1940, before [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_during_World_War_II"] Japan formally entered the war, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San"] Aung San formed the
 Burma Independence Army in Japan.
As a major battleground, Burma was devastated during World War British troops firing a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)"] mortar on the
II by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Burma"] Japanese invasion. Within months after they entered the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawchi"] Mawchi road, July 1944
war, Japanese troops had advanced on Rangoon, and the British
administration had collapsed. A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Burma"] Burmese Executive Administration
headed by Ba Maw was established by the Japanese in August 1942. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orde_Wingate"] Wingate's British [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chindits"] Chindits were
formed into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-range_penetration"] long-range penetration groups trained to operate deep behind Japanese lines.[70] A similar
 American unit, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill%27s_Marauders"] Merrill's Marauders, followed the Chindits into the Burmese jungle in 1943.[71] Beginning
in late 1944, allied troops launched a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma_campaign_1944"] series of offensives that led to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma_campaign_1944%E2%80%9345"] end of Japanese rule in July 1945.
The battles were intense with much of Burma laid waste by the fighting. Overall, the Japanese lost some
150,000 men in Burma with 1,700 prisoners taken.[72] Although many Burmese fought initially for the
Japanese as part of the Burma Independence Army, many Burmese, mostly from the ethnic minorities,
served in the British Burma Army.[73] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma_Independence_Army"] Burma National Army and the Arakan National Army fought
with the Japanese from 1942 to 1944 but switched allegiance to the Allied side in 1945. Overall, 170,000
to 250,000 Burmese civilians died during World War II.[74]
Following [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"] World War II, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San"] Aung San negotiated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panglong_Agreement"] Panglong Agreement with ethnic leaders that guaranteed
the independence of Myanmar as a unified state. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_Zan_Wai"] Aung Zan Wai, Pe Khin, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Hmu_Aung"] Bo Hmu Aung, Sir Maung Gyi,
 Dr. Sein Mya Maung, Myoma U Than Kywe were among the negotiators of the historic Panglong
Conference negotiated with Bamar leader General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San"] Aung San and other ethnic leaders in 1947. In 1947,
Aung San became Deputy Chairman of the Executive Council of Myanmar, a transitional government. But
in July 1947, political rivals[75] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_Martyrs%27_Day"] assassinated Aung San and several cabinet members.[76]
Independence (1948–1962)
On [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(Myanmar)"] 4 January 1948, the nation became an independent republic,
under the terms of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma_Independence_Act_1947"] Burma Independence Act 1947. The new
country was named the Union of Burma, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sao_Shwe_Thaik"] Sao Shwe Thaik as
its first president and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_Nu"] U Nu as its first prime minister. Unlike most
other former British colonies and overseas territories, Burma did
not become a member of the Commonwealth. A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism"] bicameral
parliament was formed, consisting of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_Deputies_(Burma)"] Chamber of Deputies and a
 Chamber of Nationalities,[77] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_system"] multi-party elections were held in
 1951–1952, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1956_Burmese_general_election"] 1956 and 1960.
The geographical area Burma encompasses today can be traced to
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panglong_Agreement"] Panglong Agreement, which combined Burma Proper, which
consisted of Lower Burma and Upper Burma, and the Frontier
Areas, which had been administered separately by the British.[78]

In 1961, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_Thant"] U Thant, the Union of Burma's Permanent Representative to the United Nations and former
secretary to the prime minister, was elected [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations"] Secretary-General of the United Nations, a position he held for
 ten years.[79] Among the Burmese to work at the UN when he was secretary-general was Aung San Suu

 Kyi (daughter of Aung San), who went on to become winner of the 1991 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize"] Nobel Peace Prize.
When the non-Burman ethnic groups pushed for autonomy or federalism, alongside having a weak civilian
government at the centre, the military leadership staged a coup d'état in 1962. Though incorporated in the
1947 Constitution, successive military governments construed the use of the term [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism"] 'federalism' as being anti-
national, anti-unity and pro-disintegration.[80]
Military rule (1962–2011)
On 2 March 1962, the military led by General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ne_Win"] Ne Win [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1962_Burmese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat"] took control of Burma through a coup d'état, and the
government had been under direct or indirect control by the military since then. Between 1962 and 1974,
Myanmar was ruled by a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Revolutionary_Council"] revolutionary council headed by the general. Almost all aspects of society
 (business, media, production) were nationalised or brought under government control under the Burmese
Way to Socialism,[81] which combined Soviet-style nationalisation and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_planning"] central planning.
A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Myanmar"] new constitution of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Republic_of_the_Union_of_Burma"] Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma was adopted in 1974. Until 1988, the
country was ruled as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state"] one-party system, with the general and other military officers resigning and ruling
through the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma_Socialist_Programme_Party"] Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP).[82] During this period, Myanmar became one of the
world's most impoverished countries.[83] There were sporadic protests against military rule during the Ne
Win years, and these were almost always violently suppressed. On 7 July 1962, the government broke up
 demonstrations at Rangoon University, killing 15 students.[81] In 1974, the military violently suppressed
 anti-government protests at the funeral of U Thant. Student protests in 1975, 1976, and 1977 were quickly
suppressed by overwhelming force.[82]
In 1988, unrest over economic mismanagement and political
oppression by the government led to widespread pro-democracy
 demonstrations throughout the country known as the 8888
Uprising. Security forces killed thousands of demonstrators, and
 General Saw Maung staged a coup d'état and formed the State Law
and Order Restoration Council (SLORC).  In 1989, SLORC
declared martial law after widespread protests. The military
government finalised plans for People's Assembly elections on 31
May 1989.[84] SLORC changed the country's official English
name from the "Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma" to the
"Union of Myanmar" on 18 June 1989 by enacting the adaptation
of the expression law. 
Protesters gathering in central

In May 1990, the government held free multiparty elections for the first time in almost 30 years, and the
 National League for Democracy (NLD), the party of Aung San Suu Kyi, won[85] earning 392 out of a total
492 seats (i.e., 80% of the seats). However, the military junta refused to cede power[86] and continued to
rule the nation, first as SLORC and, from 1997, as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) until
its dissolution in March 2011. General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Than_Shwe"] Than Shwe took over the Chairmanship – effectively the position of
Myanmar's top ruler – from General Saw Maung in 1992 and held it until 2011.[87]
On 23 June 1997, Myanmar was admitted into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. On 27 March
2006, the military junta, which had moved the national capital from Yangon to a site near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyinmana"] Pyinmana in
November 2005, officially named the new capital Naypyidaw, meaning "city of the kings".[88]
In August 2007, an increase in the price of fuel led to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron_Revolution"] Saffron Revolution led by Buddhist monks that
were dealt with harshly by the government.[89] The government cracked down on them on 26 September
2007, with reports of barricades at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shwedagon_Pagoda"] Shwedagon Pagoda and monks killed. There were also rumours of
Page 11
disagreement within the Burmese armed forces, but none was
confirmed. The military crackdown against unarmed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest"] protesters was
 widely condemned as part of the international reactions to the
Saffron Revolution and led to an increase in economic sanctions
against the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Myanmar"] Burmese Government.
In May 2008, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Nargis"] Cyclone Nargis caused extensive damage in the
densely populated rice-farming delta of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayeyarwady_Region"] Irrawaddy Division.[90]
It was the worst natural disaster in Burmese history with reports of
an estimated 200,000 people dead or missing, damages totalled to
10 billion US dollars, and as many as 1 million were left
homeless.[91] In the critical days following this disaster, Myanmar's
 isolationist government was accused of hindering United Nations
recovery efforts.[92] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid"] Humanitarian aid was requested, but concerns
about foreign military or intelligence presence in the country
delayed the entry of United States military planes delivering
medicine, food, and other supplies.[93]
In early August 2009, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Kokang_incident"] a conflict broke out in Shan State in northern
Myanmar. For several weeks, junta troops fought against ethnic
minorities including the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokang_Chinese"] Han Chinese,[94] Wa, and Kachin.[95][96]
During 8–12 August, the first days of the conflict, as many as
10,000 Burmese civilians fled to Yunnan in neighbouring
China.[95][96][97]

 Civil wars have been a constant feature of Myanmar's socio-political landscape since the attainment of
independence in 1948. These wars are predominantly struggles for ethnic and sub-national autonomy, with
the areas surrounding the ethnically Bamar central districts of the country serving as the primary
geographical setting of conflict. Foreign journalists and visitors require a special travel permit to visit the
areas in which Myanmar's civil wars continue.[98]
In October 2012, the ongoing conflicts in Myanmar included the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kachin_conflict"] Kachin conflict,[99] between the Pro-
Christian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kachin_Independence_Army"] Kachin Independence Army and the government;[100] a civil war between the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_people"] Rohingya Muslims
and the government and non-government groups in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakhine_State"] Rakhine State;[101] and a conflict between the
Shan,[102] Lahu, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_people"] Karen[103][104] minority groups, and the government in the eastern half of the
country. In addition, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda"] al-Qaeda signalled an intention to become involved in Myanmar. In a video released
on 3 September 2014, mainly addressed to India, the militant group's leader [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayman_al-Zawahiri"] Ayman al-Zawahiri said al-
Qaeda had not forgotten the Muslims of Myanmar and that the group was doing "what they can to rescue
you".[105] In response, the military raised its level of alertness, while the Burmese Muslim Association
issued a statement saying Muslims would not tolerate any threat to their motherland.[106]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Kokang_offensive"] Armed conflict between ethnic Chinese rebels and the Myanmar Armed Forces resulted in the Kokang
offensive in February 2015. The conflict had forced 40,000 to 50,000 civilians to flee their homes and seek
shelter on the Chinese side of the border.[107] During the incident, the government of China was accused of
giving military assistance to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokang_Chinese"] ethnic Chinese rebels. Burmese officials have been historically
"manipulated" and pressured by the Chinese government throughout Burmese modern history to create
closer and binding ties with China, creating a Chinese satellite state in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"] Southeast Asia.[108] However,
uncertainties exist as clashes between Burmese troops and local insurgent groups continue.

Period of liberalisation, 2011–2021
The military-backed Government had promulgated a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadmap_to_democracy"] "Roadmap to Discipline-flourishing Democracy" in
1993, but the process appeared to stall several times, until 2008 when the Government published a new
draft national constitution, and organised a (flawed) national referendum which adopted it. The new
constitution provided for election of a national assembly with powers to appoint a president, while
practically ensuring army control at all levels.[109]
A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Myanmar_general_election"] general election in 2010 - the first for twenty years - was
 boycotted by the NLD. The military-backed Union Solidarity and
Development Party declared victory, stating that it had been
favoured by 80 per cent of the votes; fraud, however, was
alleged.[110][111] A nominally civilian government was then
formed, with retired general [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thein_Sein"] Thein Sein as President.[112]
A series of liberalising political and economic actions – or reforms
– then took place. By the end of 2011 these included the release of
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest, the
establishment of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar_National_Human_Rights_Commission"] National Human Rights Commission, the
granting of general amnesties for more than 200 political prisoners,
new labour laws that permitted labour unions and strikes, a

Secretary of State [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton"] Hillary Clinton

relaxation of press censorship, and the regulation of currency
practices.[113] In response, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State"] United States Secretary of State [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton"] Hillary Clinton visited Myanmar in December
2011 – the first visit by a US Secretary of State in more than fifty years[114] – meeting both President Thein
Sein and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.[115]
 Aung San Suu Kyi's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_for_Democracy"] NLD party participated in the 2012 by-elections, facilitated by the government's
abolition of the laws that previously barred it.[116] In the April 2012 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Myanmar_by-elections"] by-elections, the NLD won 43 of the
45 available seats. The 2012 by-elections were also the first time that international representatives were
allowed to monitor the voting process in Myanmar.[117]
Myanmar's improved international reputation was indicated by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN"] ASEAN's approval of Myanmar's bid for
the position of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN"] ASEAN chair in 2014.[118]
2015 general elections
General elections [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Myanmar_general_election"] were held on 8 November 2015. These were the first openly contested elections held in
 Myanmar since the 1990 general election (which was annulled[119]). The results gave the NLD an absolute
majority of seats in both chambers of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament"] national parliament, enough to ensure that its candidate would
become president, while NLD leader [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"] Aung San Suu Kyi is constitutionally barred from the
presidency.[119][120]
The new parliament convened on 1 February 2016,[121] and on 15 March 2016, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Htin_Kyaw"] Htin Kyaw was elected as
the first non-military president since the military coup of 1962.[122] On 6 April 2016, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"] Aung San Suu Kyi
assumed the newly created role of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Counsellor_of_Myanmar"] state counsellor, a role akin to a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Myanmar"] prime minister.[123]
Analysis of liberalisation period
 Throughout this decade of apparent liberalisation, opinions differed whether a transition to liberal
democracy was underway. To some it appeared merely that the Burmese military was allowing certain civil
liberties while clandestinely institutionalising itself further into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Myanmar"] Burmese politics and economy.[124][125][126]

2020 elections and 2021 military coup d'état
Election and aftermath
 In Myanmar's 2020 parliamentary election,the ostensibly ruling National
 League for Democracy (NLD), the party of State Counsellor Aung San
Suu Kyi, competed with various other smaller parties – particularly the
military-affiliated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Solidarity_and_Development_Party"] Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP).
Other parties and individuals allied with specific ethnic minorities also ran
for office.[127]
Suu Kyi's NLD won the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Myanmar_general_election"] 2020 Myanmar general election on 8 November
in a landslide, again winning supermajorities in both houses[127][128]—
winning 396 out of 476 elected seats in parliament.[129]
The USDP, regarded as a proxy for the military, suffered a "humiliating"
defeat[130][131] – even worse than in 2015[131] – capturing only 33 of the
476 elected seats.[129][130]
As the election results began emerging, the USDP rejected them, urging a
new election with the military as observers.[127][131]
More than 90 other, smaller parties contested the vote, including more
than 15 who complained of irregularities. However, election observers
declared there were no major irregularities in the voting.[130] 
Map of Myanmar and its
 divisions, including Shan
 State, Kachin State, Rakhine
State and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayah_State"] Karen State.
The military – arguing that it had found over 8 million irregularities in
voter lists, in over 300 townships – called on Myanmar's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Election_Commission"] Union Election Commission (UEC) and
government to review the results, but the commission dismissed the claims for lack of any
evidence.[129][132]
The election commission declared that any irregularities were too few and too minor to affect the outcome
of the election.[130] However, despite the election commission validating the NLD's overwhelming
victory,[132] the USDP and Myanmar's military persistently alleged fraud[133][134] and the military
threatened to "take action".[130][135][136][137][138]In January, 2021, just before the new parliament was to
be sworn in, The NLD announced that Suu Kyi would retain her State Counsellor role in the upcoming
government.[139]
Coup
In the early morning of 1 February 2021, the day parliament was set to convene, the Tatmadaw, Myanmar's
military, detained State Counsellor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"] Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the ruling party.[130][140][141]
The military handed power to military chief [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Aung_Hlaing"] Min Aung Hlaing and declared a state of emergency for one
year[142][140] and began closing the borders, restricting travel and electronic communications
nationwide.[141]
The military announced it would replace the existing election commission with a new one, and a military
media outlet indicated new elections would be held in about one year – though the military avoided making
an official commitment to that.[141]
Page 14
State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint were placed under house arrest, and the
military began filing various charges against them. The military expelled NLD party Members of
Parliament from the capital city, Naypyitaw.[141] By 15 March 2021 the military leadership continued to
extend martial law into more parts of Yangon, while security forces killed 38 people in a single day of
violence.[143]
Reaction
By the second day of the coup, thousands of protesters were
marching in the streets of the nation's largest city, and commercial
capital, Yangon, and other protests erupted nationwide, largely
halting commerce and transportation. Despite the military's arrests
and killings of protesters, the first weeks of the coup found growing
public participation, including groups of civil servants, teachers,
students, workers, monks and religious leaders – even normally
disaffected ethnic minorities.[144][145][141]
 The coup was immediately condemned by the United Nations
Secretary General, and leaders of democratic nations – including 
Protesters against the military coup
in Myanmar
the United States President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden"] Joe Biden, western European political
leaders, Southeast Asian democracies, and others around the world, who demanded or urged release of the
captive leaders, and an immediate return to democratic rule in Myanmar. The U.S. threatened sanctions on
the military and its leaders, including a "freeze" of US$1 billion of their assets in the U.S.[144][141]
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Russia, Vietnam, Thailand, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines"] Philippines and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"] China refrained from
criticizing the military coup.[146][147][148][149] The representatives of Russia and China had conferred with
the Tatmadaw leader Gen. Hlaing just days before the coup[150][151][152] Their possible complicity
angered civilian protesters in Myanmar.[153][154] However, both of those nations refrained from blocking a
 United Nations Security Council resolution calling for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and the other
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Human_Rights"] detained leaders[144][141] – a position shared by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human
Rights.[141]
International development and aid partners – business, non-governmental, and governmental – hinted at
suspension of partnerships with Myanmar. Banks were closed and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media"] Social media communications platforms,
including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"] Facebook and Twitter, removed Tatmadaw postings. Protesters appeared at Myanmar embassies
in foreign countries.[144][141]
Geography
Myanmar has a total area of 678,500 square kilometres (262,000 sq mi). It lies between latitudes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9th_parallel_north"] 9° and
 29°N, and longitudes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/92nd_meridian_east"] 92° and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/102nd_meridian_east"] 102°E. Myanmar is bordered in the northwest by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong_Division"] Chittagong Division of
 Bangladesh and the Mizoram, Manipur, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagaland"] Nagaland and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arunachal_Pradesh"] Arunachal Pradesh states of India. Its north and
northeast border is with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet_Autonomous_Region"] Tibet Autonomous Region and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan"] Yunnan for a Sino-Myanmar border total of
2,185 km (1,358 mi). It is bounded by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laos"] Laos and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"] Thailand to the southeast. Myanmar has 1,930 km
(1,200 mi) of contiguous coastline along the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Bengal"] Bay of Bengal and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andaman_Sea"] Andaman Sea to the southwest and the
south, which forms one quarter of its total perimeter.[3]
In the north, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hengduan_Mountains"] Hengduan Mountains form the border with China. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hkakabo_Razi"] Hkakabo Razi, located in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kachin_State"] Kachin State,
at an elevation of 5,881 metres (19,295 ft), is the highest point in Myanmar.[155] Many mountain ranges,
such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakhine_Yoma"] Rakhine Yoma, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bago_Yoma"] Bago Yoma, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shan_Hills"] Shan Hills and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenasserim_Hills"] Tenasserim Hills exist within Myanmar,
all of which run north-to-south from the Himalayas.[156] The mountain chains divide Myanmar's three river
Page 15
 systems, which are the Irrawaddy, Salween
(Thanlwin),  and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sittaung_River"] Sittaung rivers.[157] The
Irrawaddy River, Myanmar's longest river at nearly
 2,170 kilometres (1,348 mi), flows into the Gulf of
Martaban. Fertile plains exist in the valleys between
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_chain"] mountain chains.[156] The majority of Myanmar's
population lives in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrawaddy_River"] Irrawaddy valley, which is
 situated between the Rakhine Yoma and the Shan
Plateau.
Administrative divisions
Myanmar is divided into seven states (ပြည်နယ်) and Myanmar map of Köppen climate classification.
seven regions (တိုင်းဒေသကြီး),  formerly called
divisions.[158] Regions are predominantly Bamar (that is,
mainly inhabited by Myanmar's dominant ethnic group).
States, in essence, are regions that are home to particular
ethnic minorities. The administrative divisions are further
subdivided into districts, which are further subdivided into
townships, wards, and villages.
Below are the number of districts, townships, cities/towns,
wards, village groups and villages in each division and
state of Myanmar as of 31 December 2001:[159]

Climate
Much of the country lies between the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer"] Tropic of Cancer and the Equator. It lies in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon"] monsoon region of
Asia, with its coastal regions receiving over 5,000 mm (196.9 in) of rain annually. Annual [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(meteorology)"] rainfall in the
 delta region is approximately 2,500 mm (98.4 in), while average annual rainfall in the dry zone in central
Myanmar is less than 1,000 mm (39.4 in). The northern regions of Myanmar are the coolest, with average
temperatures of 21 °C (70 °F). Coastal and delta regions have an average maximum temperature of 32 °C
(89.6 °F).[157]
Biodiversity
Myanmar is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"] biodiverse country with more than 16,000 plant, 314
mammal, 1131 bird, 293 reptile, and 139 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian"] amphibian species, and 64
terrestrial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystems"] ecosystems including tropical and subtropical vegetation,
seasonally inundated wetlands, shoreline and tidal systems, and
alpine ecosystems. Myanmar houses some of the largest intact
natural ecosystems in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia"] Southeast Asia, but the remaining ecosystems
are under threat from land use intensification and over-exploitation.
According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUCN_Red_List_of_Ecosystems"] IUCN Red List of Ecosystems categories and
criteria more than a third of Myanmar's land area has been
converted to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropogenic_biome"] anthropogenic ecosystems over the last 2–3 centuries, 
 The limestone landscape of Kayin
State
and nearly half of its ecosystems are threatened. Despite large gaps
 in information for some ecosystems, there is a large potential to develop a comprehensive protected area
network that protects its terrestrial biodiversity.[160]
Page 17
Myanmar continues to perform badly in the global [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Performance_Index"] Environmental Performance Index (EPI) with an overall
ranking of 153 out of 180 countries in 2016; among the worst in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia"] South Asian region, only ahead of
 Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The EPI was established in 2001 by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum"] World Economic Forum as a global
 gauge to measure how well individual countries perform in implementing the United Nations' Sustainable
 Development Goals. The environmental areas where Myanmar performs worst (i.e. highest ranking) are air
quality (174), health impacts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues"] environmental issues (143) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity"] biodiversity and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat"] habitat (142). Myanmar
performs best (i.e. lowest ranking) in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_fishing"] environmental impacts of fisheries (21) but with declining [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_stocks"] fish stocks.
Despite several issues, Myanmar also ranks 64 and scores very good (i.e. a high percentage of 93.73%) in
 environmental effects of the agricultural industry because of an excellent management of the nitrogen
cycle.[161][162] Myanmar is one of the most highly vulnerable countries to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"] climate change; this poses a
number of social, political, economic and foreign policy challenges to the country.[163] The country had a
2019 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Landscape_Integrity_Index"] Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.18/10, ranking it 49th globally out of 172
countries.[164]
Myanmar's slow economic growth has contributed to the preservation of much of its environment and
ecosystems. Forests, including dense tropical growth and valuable [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teak"] teak in lower Myanmar, cover over 49%
 of the country, including areas of acacia, bamboo, ironwood and Magnolia champaca. Coconut and betel
palm and rubber have been introduced. In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highland"] highlands of the north, oak, pine and various rhododendrons
cover much of the land.[165]
Heavy logging since the new 1995 forestry law went into effect has seriously reduced forest area and
wildlife habitat.[166] The lands along the coast support all varieties of tropical fruits and once had large
areas of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar_Coast_mangroves"] mangroves although much of the protective mangroves have disappeared. In much of central
Myanmar (the dry zone), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation"] vegetation is sparse and stunted.
Typical jungle animals, particularly tigers, occur sparsely in Myanmar. In upper Myanmar, there are
rhinoceros, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_water_buffalo"] wild water buffalo, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clouded_leopard"] clouded leopard, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar"] wild boars, deer, antelope, and elephants, which are also
tamed or bred in captivity for use as work animals, particularly in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_industry"] lumber industry. Smaller mammals
are also numerous, ranging from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbon"] gibbons and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey"] monkeys to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pteropus"] flying foxes. The abundance of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird"] birds is notable
with over 800 species, including parrots, myna, peafowl, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl"] red junglefowl, weaverbirds, crows, herons, and
 barn owl. Among reptile species there are crocodiles, geckos, cobras, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_python"] Burmese pythons, and turtles.
Hundreds of species of freshwater fish are wide-ranging, plentiful and are very important food sources.[167]
Climate change
Previously and currently analysed data, as well as future projections on changes caused by climate change
predict serious consequences to development for all economic, productive, social, and environmental
 sectors in Myanmar.[168] In order to combat the hardships ahead and do its part to help combat climate
change Myanmar has displayed interest in expanding its use of renewable energy and lowering its level of
carbon emissions. Groups involved in helping Myanmar with the transition and move forward include the
 UN Environment Programme, Myanmar Climate Change Alliance, and the Ministry of Natural Resources
and Environmental Conservation which directed in producing the final draft of the Myanmar national
climate change policy that was presented to various sectors of the Myanmar government for review.[169]
In April 2015, it was announced that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank"] World Bank and Myanmar would enter a full partnership
framework aimed to better access to electricity and other basic services for about six million people and
expected to benefit three million pregnant woman and children through improved health services.[170]
Acquired funding and proper planning has allowed Myanmar to better prepare for the impacts of climate
change by enacting programs which teach its people new farming methods, rebuild its infrastructure with
materials resilient to natural disasters, and transition various sectors towards reducing greenhouse gas
emissions.[171]

But in

 became the Acting President of Myanmar and handed the power to the Commander-in-Chief of Defence
Services [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Aung_Hlaing"] Min Aung Hlaing and he assumed the role [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_State_Administration_Council"] Chairman of the State Administration Council, then
 Prime Minister. The President of Myanmar acts as the de jure head of state and the Chairman of the State
Administration Council acts as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto"] de facto [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government"] head of government.[172]
The constitution of Myanmar, its third since independence, was
drafted by its military rulers and published in September 2008. The
 country is governed as a parliamentary system with a bicameral
legislature (with an executive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Myanmar"] president accountable to the
legislature), with 25% of the legislators appointed by the military
and the rest elected in general elections.
The legislature, called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_the_Union"] Assembly of the Union, is bicameral and
made up of two houses: the 224-seat upper [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Nationalities"] House of Nationalities
and the 440-seat lower [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Myanmar)"] House of Representatives. The upper house
consists 168 members who are directly elected and 56 who are 
 Assembly of the Union (Pyidaungsu
Hluttaw)
appointed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatmadaw"] Burmese Armed Forces. The lower house consists
of 330 members who are directly elected and 110 who are appointed by the armed forces.
Political culture
 The major political parties are the National League for Democracy and the Union Solidarity and
Development Party.
Myanmar's army-drafted constitution was approved in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Burmese_constitutional_referendum"] referendum in May 2008. The results, 92.4% of
the 22 million voters with an official turnout of 99%, are considered suspect by many international
observers and by the National League of Democracy with reports of widespread fraud, ballot stuffing, and
voter intimidation.[173]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Myanmar_general_election"] elections of 2010 resulted in a victory for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party.
Various foreign observers questioned the fairness of the elections.[174][175][176] One criticism of the
election was that only government-sanctioned political parties were allowed to contest in it and the popular
Page 19
 National League for Democracy was declared illegal.[177] However, immediately following the elections,
the government ended the house arrest of the democracy advocate and leader of the National League for
Democracy, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"] Aung San Suu Kyi,[178] and her ability to move freely around the country is considered an
important test of the military's movement toward more openness.[177] After unexpected [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011%E2%80%932015_Myanmar_political_reforms"] reforms in 2011,
 NLD senior leaders have decided to register as a political party and to field candidates in future by-
elections.[179]
Myanmar's political history is underlined by its struggle to establish democratic structures amidst conflicting
factions. This political transition from a closely held military rule to a free democratic system is widely
believed to be determining the future of Myanmar. The resounding victory of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"] Aung San Suu Kyi's National
League for Democracy in the 2015 general election raised hope for a successful culmination of this
transition.[180][181]
Myanmar rates as a corrupt nation on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Perceptions_Index"] Corruption Perceptions Index with a rank of 130th out of 180
countries worldwide, with 1st being least corrupt, as of 2019.[182]
Foreign relations
 Though the country's foreign relations, particularly with Western
nations, have historically been strained, the situation has markedly
improved since the reforms following the 2010 elections. After
years of diplomatic isolation and economic and military
sanctions,[183] the United States relaxed curbs on foreign aid to
Myanmar in November 2011[115] and announced the resumption of
diplomatic relations on 13 January 2012[184] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"] European Union
has placed sanctions on Myanmar, including an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_embargo"] arms embargo,
cessation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_preference"] trade preferences, and suspension of all aid with the
exception of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid"] humanitarian aid.[185] 
Myanmar President Thein Sein

Sanctions imposed by the United States and European countries
against the former military government, coupled with boycotts and other
direct pressure on corporations by supporters of the democracy movement,
have resulted in the withdrawal from the country of most U.S. and many
 European companies.[186] On 13 April 2012, British Prime Minister David
Cameron called for the economic sanctions on Myanmar to be suspended
in the wake of the pro-democracy party gaining 43 seats out of a possible
45 in the 2012 by-elections with the party leader, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"] Aung San Suu Kyi
becoming a member of the Burmese parliament.[187]
Despite Western isolation, Asian corporations have generally remained
willing to continue investing in the country and to initiate new investments,
particularly in natural resource extraction. The country has close relations
with neighbouring India and China with several Indian and Chinese
companies operating in the country. Under India's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_East_policy_(India)"] Look East policy, fields
of co-operation between India and Myanmar include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_sensing"] remote sensing,[188]
oil and gas exploration,[189] information technology,[190] hydropower[191]
and construction of ports and buildings.[192] 
 The former Secretary-
General of the United
Nations, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_Thant"] U Thant (1961–
1971)
In 2008, India suspended military aid to Myanmar over the issue of human rights abuses by the ruling junta,
although it has preserved extensive commercial ties, which provide the regime with much-needed
 revenue.[193] The thaw in relations began on 28 November 2011, when Belarusian Prime Minister Mikhail
Page 20
 Myasnikovich and his wife Ludmila arrived in the capital, Naypyidaw, the same day as the country
received a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who also met with pro-democracy opposition
leader Aung San Suu Kyi.[194] International relations progress indicators continued in September 2012
when Aung San Suu Kyi visited the United States[195] followed by Myanmar's reformist president visit to
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"] United Nations.[196]
In May 2013, Thein Sein became the first Myanmar president to visit the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"] White House in 47 years; the last
Burmese leader to visit the White House was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ne_Win"] Ne Win in September 1966. President [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama"] Barack Obama praised
the former general for political and economic reforms and the cessation of tensions between Myanmar and
the United States. Political activists objected to the visit because of concerns over human rights abuses in
Myanmar, but Obama assured Thein Sein that Myanmar will receive U.S. support. The two leaders
discussed the release of more political prisoners, the institutionalisation of political reform and the rule of
law, and ending ethnic conflict in Myanmar—the two governments agreed to sign a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_trade"] bilateral trade and
investment framework agreement on 21 May 2013.[197]
In June 2013, Myanmar held its first ever summit, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum"] World Economic Forum on East Asia 2013. A
regional spinoff of the annual [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum"] World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the summit was held on 5–7
June and attended by 1,200 participants, including 10 heads of state, 12 ministers and 40 senior directors
from around the world.[198] In July 2019, UN ambassadors of 37 countries, including Myanmar, have
signed a joint letter to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council"] United Nations Human Rights Council defending China's treatment of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghurs"] Uyghurs
and other Muslim minority groups in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang"] Xinjiang region.[199]

Myanmar has received extensive military aid from China in the
past.[200]Myanmar has been a member of ASEAN since 1997.
Though it gave up its turn to hold the ASEAN chair and host the
 ASEAN Summit in 2006, it chaired the forum and hosted the
summit in 2014.[201] In November 2008, Myanmar's political
situation with neighbouring Bangladesh became tense as they
began searching for natural gas in a disputed block of the Bay of
Bengal.[202] Controversy surrounding the Rohingya population
also remains an issue between Bangladesh and Myanmar.[203]
Myanmar's armed forces are known as the Tatmadaw, which
 numbers 488,000. The Tatmadaw comprises the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. The country ranked
twelfth in the world for its number of active troops in service.[29] The military is very influential in
Myanmar, with all top cabinet and ministry posts usually held by military officials. Official figures for
military spending are not available. Estimates vary widely because of uncertain exchange rates, but
Myanmar's military forces' expenses are high.[204] Myanmar imports most of its weapons from Russia,
Ukraine, China and India.
Myanmar is building a research [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor"] nuclear reactor near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyin_Oo_Lwin"] Pyin Oo Lwin with help from Russia. It is one of the
 signatories of the nuclear non-proliferation pact since 1992 and a member of the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) since 1957. The military junta had informed the IAEA in September 2000 of its
intention to construct the reactor.[205][206] In 2010 as part of the Wikileaks leaked cables, Myanmar was
suspected of using North Korean construction teams to build a fortified surface-to-air missile facility.[207]
As of 2019, the United States [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Arms_Control,_Verification,_and_Compliance"] Bureau of Arms Control assessed that Myanmar is not in violation of its
obligations under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons"] Non-Proliferation Treaty but that the Myanmar government had a history of non-
transparency on its nuclear programs and aims.[208]
Page 21
Until 2005, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly"] United Nations General Assembly annually adopted a detailed resolution about the situation
in Myanmar by consensus.[209][210][211][212] But in 2006 a divided United Nations General Assembly
voted through a resolution that strongly called upon the government of Myanmar to end its systematic
violations of human rights.[213] In January 2007, Russia and China vetoed a draft resolution before the
 United Nations Security Council[214] calling on the government of Myanmar to respect human rights and
begin a democratic transition. South Africa also voted against the resolution.[215]
Human rights and internal conflicts
There is consensus that the former military regime in Myanmar (1962–
2010) was one of the world's  most repressive and abusive
regimes.[216][217] In November 2012, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Power"] Samantha Power, Barack Obama's
Special Assistant to the President on Human Rights, wrote on the White
House blog in advance of the president's visit that "Serious human rights
abuses against civilians in several regions continue, including against
women and children."[102] Members of the United Nations and major
international human rights organisations have issued repeated and
consistent reports of widespread and systematic human rights violations in
Myanmar. The United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly[218]
called on the Burmese military junta to respect human rights and in
November 2009 the General Assembly adopted a resolution "strongly
condemning the ongoing systematic violations of human rights and
fundamental freedoms" and calling on the Burmese military regime "to
take urgent measures to put an end to violations of international human
rights and humanitarian law."[219]
 International human rights organisations including Human Rights
 Watch,[220] Amnesty International[221] and the American Association for
the Advancement of Science[222] have repeatedly documented and
condemned widespread human rights violations in Myanmar. The
Freedom in the World 2011 report by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_House"] Freedom House notes, "The
military junta has ... suppressed nearly all basic rights; and committed
 human rights abuses with impunity." In July 2013, the Assistance
Association for Political Prisoners indicated that there were approximately
100 political prisoners being held in Burmese prisons.[223][224][225][226]

Evidence gathered by a British researcher was published in 2005
regarding the extermination or "Burmisation" of certain ethnic minorities, such as the Karen, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karenni"] Karenni and
Shan.[227]
Based on the evidence gathered by Amnesty photographs and video of the ongoing armed conflict between
the Myanmar military and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arakan_Army_(Kachin_State)"] Arakan Army (AA), attacks escalated on civilians in Rakhine State. Ming Yu
Hah, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International"] Amnesty International's Deputy Regional Director for Campaigns said, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council"] UN Security Council must
urgently refer the situation in Myanmar to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court"] International Criminal Court.[229] The military is notorious
for rampant use of sexual violence.[13]
Child soldiers
Child soldiers were reported in 2012 to have played a major part in the Burmese Army.[230] The
Independent reported in June 2012 that "Children are being sold as conscripts into the Burmese military for
as little as $40 and a bag of rice or a can of petrol."[231] The UN's Special Representative of the Secretary-
Page 22
 General for Children and Armed Conflict, Radhika
Coomaraswamy, who stepped down from her position a week later,
met representatives of the government of Myanmar in July 2012
and stated that she hoped the government's signing of an action
plan would "signal a transformation."[232] In September 2012, the
Myanmar Armed Forces released 42 child soldiers, and the
 International Labour Organization met with representatives of the
government as well as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kachin_Independence_Army"] Kachin Independence Army to secure
the release of more child soldiers.[233] According to Samantha
Power, a U.S. delegation raised the issue of child soldiers with the
government in October 2012. However, she did not comment on
the government's progress towards reform in this area.[102]

Slavery and human trafficking
 Forced labour, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking"] human trafficking, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labour"] child labour are common in Myanmar.[234][235] In 2007 the
international movement to defend women's human rights issues in Myanmar was said to be gaining
speed.[236] Human trafficking happens mostly to women who are unemployed and have low incomes.
They are mainly targeted or deceived by brokers into making them believe that better opportunities and
wages exist for them abroad.[237] In 2017, the government reported investigating 185 trafficking cases. The
government of Burma makes little effort to eliminate human trafficking. Burmese armed forces compel
troops to acquire labour and supplies from local communities. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State"] U.S. State Department reported that both
the government and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatmadaw"] Tatmadaw were complicit in sex and labour trafficking.[238] Women and girls from all
 ethnic groups and foreigners have been victims of sex trafficking in Myanmar.[230] They are forced into
prostitution, marriages, and or pregnancies.[239][240]
Genocide allegations and crimes against Rohingya people
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_people"] Rohingya people have consistently faced human rights abuses
by the Burmese regime that has refused to acknowledge them as
Burmese citizens (despite some of them having lived in Burma for
over three generations)—the Rohingya have been denied Burmese
citizenship since the enactment of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar_nationality_law"] 1982 citizenship law.[243] The
law created three categories of citizenship: citizenship, associate
citizenship, and naturalised citizenship. Citizenship is given to those
who belong to one of the national races such as Kachin, Kayah
(Karenni), Karen, Chin, Burman, Mon, Rakhine, Shan, Kaman, or
Zerbadee. Associate citizenship is given to those who cannot prove 
Displaced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_people"] Rohingya people of
Myanmar[241][242]
their ancestors settled in Myanmar before 1823 but can prove they
have one grandparent, or pre-1823 ancestor, who was a citizen of another country, as well as people who
applied for citizenship in 1948 and qualified then by those laws. Naturalised citizenship is only given to
those who have at least one parent with one of these types of Burmese citizenship or can provide
"conclusive evidence" that their parents entered and resided in Burma prior to independence in 1948.[244]
The Burmese regime has attempted to forcibly expel Rohingya and bring in non-Rohingyas to replace
them[245]—this policy has resulted in the expulsion of approximately half of the 800,000[246] Rohingya
from Burma, while the Rohingya people have been described as "among the world's least wanted"[247] and
"one of the world's most persecuted minorities."[245][248][249] But the origin of the "most persecuted
minority" statement is unclear.[250]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tak_Province"]
Page 23
Rohingya are not allowed to travel without official permission, are banned from owning land, and are
required to sign a commitment to have no more than two children.[243] As of July 2012, the Myanmar
government does not include the Rohingya minority group—classified as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statelessness"] stateless Bengali Muslims from
Bangladesh since 1982—on the government's list of more than 130 ethnic races and, therefore, the
government states that they have no claim to Myanmar citizenship.[251]
In 2007 German professor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassam_Tibi"] Bassam Tibi suggested that the Rohingya conflict may be driven by an Islamist
political agenda to impose religious laws,[252] while non-religious causes have also been raised, such as a
lingering resentment over the violence that occurred during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_occupation_of_Burma"] Japanese occupation of Burma in World
War II—during this time period the British allied themselves with the Rohingya[253] and fought against the
 puppet government of Burma (composed mostly of Bamar Japanese) that helped to establish the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatmadaw"] Tatmadaw
military organisation that remains in power except for a 5-year lapse in 2016 - 2021.
Since the democratic transition began in 2011, there has been continuous violence as 280 people have been
killed and 140,000 forced to flee from their homes in the Rakhine state in 2014.[254] A UN envoy reported
in March 2013 that unrest had re-emerged between Myanmar's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism"] Buddhist and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims"] Muslim communities, with
violence spreading to towns that are located closer to Yangon.[255]
Government reforms
According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_Group"] Crisis Group,[256] since Myanmar transitioned to a new government in August 2011, the
country's human rights record has been improving. Previously giving Myanmar its lowest rating of 7, the
2012 Freedom in the World report also notes improvement, giving Myanmar a 6 for improvements in civil
liberties and political rights, the release of political prisoners, and a loosening of restrictions.[257] In 2013,
Myanmar improved yet again, receiving a score of 5 in civil liberties and 6 in political freedoms.[258]
The government has assembled a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar_National_Human_Rights_Commission"] National Human Rights Commission that consists of 15 members from
various backgrounds.[259] Several activists in exile, including Thee Lay Thee Anyeint members, have
returned to Myanmar after President Thein Sein's invitation to expatriates to return home to work for
national development.[260] In an address to the United Nations Security Council on 22 September 2011,
Myanmar's Foreign Minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wunna_Maung_Lwin"] Wunna Maung Lwin confirmed the government's intention to release prisoners
in the near future.[261]
The government has also relaxed reporting laws, but these remain highly restrictive.[262] In September
2011, several banned websites, including YouTube, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Voice_of_Burma"] Democratic Voice of Burma and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_of_America"] Voice of America,
were unblocked.[263] A 2011 report by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauser_Center_for_Nonprofit_Organizations"] Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations found that, while
contact with the Myanmar government was constrained by donor restrictions, international humanitarian
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) see opportunities for effective advocacy with government
officials, especially at the local level. At the same time, international NGOs are mindful of the ethical
quandary of how to work with the government without bolstering or appeasing it.[264]
Following Thein Sein's first ever visit to the UK and a meeting
with Prime Minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron"] David Cameron, the Myanmar president
declared that all of his nation's political prisoners will be released
by the end of 2013, in addition to a statement of support for the
well-being of the Rohingya Muslim community. In a speech at
 Chatham House, he revealed that "We [Myanmar government] are
reviewing all cases. I guarantee to you that by the end of this year,
there will be no prisoners of conscience in Myanmar.", in addition
to expressing a desire to strengthen links between the UK and
Myanmar's military forces.[265]

minority.[268] Since August 2017 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9decins_Sans_Fronti%C3%A8res"] Doctors Without Borders have treated 113 Rohingya refugee females for
sexual assault with all but one describing military assailants.[269]
Economy
 Myanmar's economy is one of the fastest growing
economies in the world with a nominal GDP of
US$76.09 billion in 2019 and an estimated purchasing
power adjusted GDP of US$327.629 billion in 2017
according to the World Bank.[270] Foreigners are able to
legally lease but not own property.[271] In December
2014, Myanmar set up its first stock exchange, the
 Yangon Stock Exchange.[272]
The informal economy's share in Myanmar is one of the
biggest in the world and is closely linked to corruption, A proportional representation of Myanmar
smuggling and illegal trade activities.[273][274] In  exports, 2019
addition, decades of civil war and unrest have
contributed to Myanmar's current levels of poverty and
lack of economic progress. Myanmar lacks adequate infrastructure. Goods travel primarily across the Thai
border (where most illegal drugs are exported) and along the Irrawaddy River.[275]
Both China and India have attempted to strengthen ties with the government for economic benefit in the
early 2010s. Many Western nations, including the United States and Canada, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"] European Union,
historically imposed investment and trade sanctions on Myanmar. The United States and European Union
eased most of their sanctions in 2012.[276] From May 2012 to February 2013, the United States began to
lift its economic sanctions on Myanmar "in response to the historic reforms that have been taking place in
that country."[277] Foreign investment comes primarily from China, Singapore, the Philippines, South
Korea, India, and Thailand.[278] The military has stakes in some major industrial corporations of the
country (from oil production and consumer goods to transportation and tourism).[279][280]
Economic history
Under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire"] British administration, the people of Burma were at the
bottom of the social hierarchy, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe"] Europeans at the top, Indians,
Chinese, and Christianized minorities in the middle, and Buddhist
Burmese at the bottom.[281] Forcefully integrated into the world
 economy, Burma's economy grew in extractive industries and cash
crops agriculture; much of the wealth was concentrated in the
hands of Europeans, however. The country became the world's
largest exporter of rice, mainly to European markets, while other
colonies like India suffered mass starvation.[282] The British
followed the ideologies of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Darwinism"] Social Darwinism and the free market,
and opened up the country to large-scale immigration with
Rangoon exceeding New York City as the greatest immigration

port in the world in the 1920s. Historian Thant Myint-U states,
"This was out of a total population of only 13 million; it was equivalent to the United Kingdom today
Page 25
taking 2 million people a year." By then, in most of the largest cities in Burma, Rangoon, Akyab, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathein"] Bassein
and Moulmein, the Indian immigrants formed a majority of the population. The Burmese under British rule
felt helpless, and reacted with a "racism that combined feelings of superiority and fear".[281]
Crude oil production, an indigenous industry of Yenangyaung, was taken over by the British and put under
 Burmah Oil monopoly. British Burma began exporting crude oil in 1853.[283] European firms produced
75% of the world's teak.[27] The wealth was however, mainly concentrated in the hands of Europeans. In
the 1930s, agricultural production fell dramatically as international rice prices declined and did not recover
for several decades.[284] During the Japanese invasion of Burma in World War II, the British followed a
 scorched earth policy. They destroyed the major government buildings, oil wells and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawchi"] mines for tungsten,
tin, lead and silver to keep them from the Japanese. Myanmar was bombed extensively by the Allies.
After independence, the country was in ruins with its major infrastructure completely destroyed. With the
loss of India, Burma lost relevance and obtained independence from the British. After a parliamentary
government was formed in 1948, Prime Minister U Nu embarked upon a policy of nationalisation and the
state was declared the owner of all land. The government tried to implement an eight-year plan partly
financed by injecting money into the economy which caused some inflation.[285] The 1962 coup d'état was
followed by an economic scheme called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_Way_to_Socialism"] Burmese Way to Socialism, a plan to nationalise all industries,
with the exception of agriculture. While the economy continued to grow at a slower rate, the country
eschewed a Western-oriented development model, and by the 1980s, was left behind capitalist
powerhouses like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"] Singapore which were integrated into Western economy.[286][83] Myanmar asked for
admittance to a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_developed_countries"] least developed country status in 1987 to receive debt relief.[287]
Agriculture
The major agricultural product is rice, which covers about 60% of
the country's total cultivated land area. Rice accounts for 97% of
total food grain production by weight. Through collaboration with
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Rice_Research_Institute"] International Rice Research Institute 52 modern rice varieties
were released in the country between 1966 and 1997, helping
increase national rice production to 14 million tons in 1987 and to
19 million tons in 1996. By 1988, modern varieties were planted on
half of the country's ricelands, including 98 per cent of the irrigated
areas.[288] In 2008 rice production was estimated at 50 million
tons.[289] 
Rice is Myanmar's largest
agricultural product.
Extractive industries
Myanmar produces precious stones such as rubies, sapphires, pearls, and jade. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby"] Rubies are the biggest
earner; 90% of the world's rubies come from the country, whose red stones are prized for their purity and
hue. Thailand buys the majority of the country's gems. Myanmar's "Valley of Rubies", the mountainous
 Mogok area, 200 km (120 mi) north of Mandalay, is noted for its rare pigeon's blood rubies and blue
sapphires.[290]
Many [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"] U.S. and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"] European jewellery companies, including Bulgari, Tiffany and Cartier, refuse to import
these stones based on reports of deplorable working conditions in the mines. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch"] Human Rights Watch has
encouraged a complete ban on the purchase of Burmese gems based on these reports and because nearly all
profits go to the ruling junta, as the majority of mining activity in the country is government-run.[291] The
government of Myanmar controls the gem trade by direct ownership or by joint ventures with private
owners of mines.[292]
Page 26
 Rare-earth elements are also a significant export, as Myanmar supplies around 10% of the world's rare
earths.[293] Conflict in Kachin State has threatened the operations of its mines as of February
2021.[294][295]
Other industries include agricultural goods, textiles, wood products, construction materials, gems, metals,
oil and natural gas. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Myanmar_Engineering_Society&action=edit&redlink=1"] Myanmar Engineering Society has identified at least 39 locations capable of geothermal
power production and some of these hydrothermal reservoirs lie quite close to Yangon which is a
significant underutilised resource for electrical production.[296]
Tourism
The government receives a significant percentage of the income of
private-sector tourism services.[297] The most popular available
tourist destinations in Myanmar include big cities such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon"] Yangon
and Mandalay; religious sites in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mon_State"] Mon State, Pindaya, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bago,_Burma"] Bago and
 Hpa-An; nature trails in Inle Lake, Kengtung, Putao, Pyin Oo
Lwin; ancient cities such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagan"] Bagan and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrauk-U"] Mrauk-U; as well as
beaches in Nabule,[298] Ngapali, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngwe_Saung_Beach"] Ngwe-Saung, Mergui.[299]
Nevertheless, much of the country is off-limits to tourists, and
interactions between foreigners and the people of Myanmar,
particularly in the border regions, are subject to police scrutiny.
They are not to discuss politics with foreigners, under penalty of
imprisonment and, in 2001, the Myanmar Tourism Promotion
Board issued an order for local officials to protect tourists and limit
"unnecessary contact" between foreigners and ordinary Burmese
people.[300] 
Tourists in Myanmar
The most common way for travellers to enter the country is by
air.[301] According to the website [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonely_Planet"] Lonely Planet,  getting into
Myanmar is problematic: "No bus or train service connects
Myanmar with another country, nor can you travel by car or  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_Bein_Bridge"] U Bein Bridge in Mandalay.
motorcycle across the border – you must walk across." They
further state that "It is not possible for foreigners to go to/from
Myanmar by sea or river."[301] There are a few border crossings that allow the passage of private vehicles,
 such as the border between Ruili (China) to Mu-se, the border between Htee Kee (Myanmar) and Phu Nam
Ron (Thailand)—the most direct border between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawei"] Dawei and Kanchanaburi, and the border between
 Myawaddy and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_Sot"] Mae Sot, Thailand. At least one tourist company has successfully run commercial overland
routes through these borders since 2013.[302]
Flights are available from most countries, though direct flights are limited to mainly Thai and other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN"] ASEAN
airlines. According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_Eleven"] Eleven magazine, "In the past, there were only 15 international airlines and
increasing numbers of airlines have begun launching direct flights from Japan, Qatar, Taiwan, South Korea,
Germany and Singapore."[303] Expansions were expected in September 2013 but are mainly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"] Thai and
other Asian-based airlines.[303]

Southeast Asia.

Myanmar's fertility rate as of 2011 is 2.23, which is slightly above
 replacement level[309] and is low compared to Southeast Asian
countries of similar economic standing, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia"] Cambodia (3.18)
and Laos (4.41).[309] There has been a significant decline in
fertility in the 2000s, from a rate of 4.7 children per woman in
1983, down to 2.4 in 2001, despite the absence of any national
population policy.[309][310][311] The fertility rate is much lower in
urban areas. 
Population pyramid 2016
The relatively rapid decline in fertility is attributed to several
factors, including extreme delays in marriage (almost unparalleled
among developing countries in the region), the prevalence of illegal abortions, and the high proportion of
single, unmarried women of reproductive age, with 25.9% of women aged 30–34 and 33.1% of men and
women aged 25–34 being single.[311][312]
These patterns stem from economic dynamics, including high income inequality, which results in residents
of reproductive age opting for delay of marriage and family-building in favour of attempting to find
employment and establish some form of wealth;[311] the average age of marriage in Myanmar is 27.5 for
men, 26.4 for women.[311][312]

 Nepali and other ethnic minorities. Included in this group are the
 Anglo-Burmese. Once forming a large and influential community,
the Anglo-Burmese left the country in steady streams from 1958
onwards, principally to Australia and the United Kingdom. It is
estimated that 52,000 Anglo-Burmese remain in Myanmar. As of
2009, 110,000 Burmese [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"] refugees were living in refugee camps in
Thailand.[316]
Refugee camps exist along Indian, Bangladeshi and Thai borders
while several thousand are in Malaysia. Conservative estimates
state that there are over 295,800 minority refugees from Myanmar,
with the majority being Rohingya, Karen, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Karen"] Karenni are
principally located along the Thai-Myanmar border.[317] There are
nine permanent refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border,
most of which were established in the mid-1980s. The refugee
camps are under the care of the Thai-Burma Border Consortium
(TBBC).  Since 2006,[318] over 55,000 Burmese [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee"] refugees have
been resettled in the United States.[319]

place in 1964.[321] The Anglo-Burmese at this time either fled the country or changed their names and
blended in with the broader Burmese society.
Many [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_people"] Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar. Many refugees headed to neighbouring Bangladesh,
including 200,000 in 1978 as a result of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Dragon_operation_in_Arakan"] King Dragon operation in Arakan.[322] 250,000 more left in

Languages
 Myanmar is home to four major language families: Sino-Tibetan, Tai–Kadai, Austro-Asiatic, and Indo-
European.[324] Sino-Tibetan languages are most widely spoken. They include Burmese, Karen, Kachin,
Chin, and Chinese (mainly Hokkien). The primary Tai–Kadai language is Shan. Mon, Palaung, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Va_people"] Wa are
the major [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austroasiatic"] Austroasiatic languages spoken in Myanmar. The two major Indo-European languages are Pali,
the liturgical language of Theravada Buddhism, and English.[325] More than a hundred languages are
spoken in total. Since many of them are known only within small tribes around the country, they may have
been lost (many if not all) after a few generations.
Burmese, the mother tongue of the Bamar and official language of Myanmar, is related to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetic_languages"] Tibetan and
Chinese.[325] It is written in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_script"] script consisting of circular and semi-circular letters, which were adapted
from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mon_language"] Mon script, which in turn was developed from a southern Indian script in the 5th century. The
earliest known inscriptions in the Burmese script date from the 11th century. It is also used to write Pali, the
sacred language of Theravada Buddhism, as well as several ethnic minority languages, including Shan,
several Karen dialects, and Kayah (Karenni), with the addition of specialised characters and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic"] diacritics for
each language.[326]
The Burmese language incorporates widespread usage of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorific"] honorifics and is age-oriented.[327] Burmese
society has traditionally stressed the importance of education. In villages, secular schooling often takes
place in monasteries. Secondary and tertiary education take place at government schools.
Religion
Many religions are practised in Myanmar. Religion in Burma ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Myanmar_Census"] 2014 Myanmar Census)[328][nb 1]

and targeting of civilians is particularly notable
in eastern Myanmar, where over 3,000 villages
have been destroyed in the past ten years.[330][331][332] More than 200,000 Muslims have fled to
Bangladesh by 2007 to escape persecution.[333][334]
A large majority of the population practices Buddhism; estimates range from 80%[335] to 89%.[336]
According to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Myanmar_Census"] 2014 Myanmar Census, 87.9% of the population identifies as Buddhists.[328] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therav%C4%81da"] Theravāda
Buddhism is the most widespread.[336] There are some 500,000 Buddhist monks and 75,000 nuns in this
country of 54 million.[337] Other religions are practised largely without obstruction, with the notable
exception of some religious minorities such as the Rohingya people, who have continued to have their
citizenship status denied and treated as illegal immigrants instead,[243] and Christians in Chin State.[338]
According to 2014 census, 6.2% of the population identifies as Christian; 4.3% as Muslim; 0.8% as
followers of tribal religions; 0.5% as Hindus; 0.2% as followers of other religions; and 0.1% follow no
religion.[328] According to the 2010 estimates of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center"] Pew Research Center, 7% of the population is
Christian; 4% is Muslim; 1% follows traditional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism"] animistic beliefs; and 2% follow other religions, including
 Mahayana Buddhism, Hinduism, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asian_religions"] East Asian religions.[339][340] Jehovah's Witnesses have been present
Page 30
since 1914[341] and have about 80 congregations around the country and a branch office in Yangon
publishing in 16 languages.[342] A tiny Jewish community in Yangon had a synagogue but no resident
rabbi.[343]
Although Hinduism is practised by 0.5% of the population, it was a
major religion in Myanmar's past. Several strains of Hinduism
existed alongside both Theravada Buddhism and Mahayana
Buddhism in the Mon and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyu_city-states"] Pyu period in the first millennium,[344]
and down to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagan_Kingdom"] Pagan period (9th to 13th centuries) when "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaivism"] Saivite
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaishnavism"] Vaishana elements enjoyed greater elite influence than they
would later do."[345] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_folk_religion"] Burmese folk religion is practised by many
 Bamars alongside Buddhism.
Health  Praying Buddhist monks in
 Shwedagon Pagoda
The general state of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"] health care in Myanmar is poor. The
government spends anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of the country's GDP on health care, consistently ranking
among the lowest in the world.[346][347] Although [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care"] health care is nominally free, in reality, patients have to
pay for medicine and treatment, even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic
facilities and equipment. The 2010 maternal mortality rate per 100,000 births for Myanmar is 240. This is
compared with 219.3 in 2008 and 662 in 1990. The under 5 mortality rate, per 1,000 births is 73 and the
neonatal mortality as a percentage of under 5's mortality is 47. According to the report named "Preventable
Fate", published by Doctors without Borders, 25,000 Burmese AIDS patients died in 2007, deaths that
could largely have been prevented by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiretroviral_therapy"] antiretroviral therapy drugs and proper treatment.[348]
HIV/AIDS, recognised as a disease of concern by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Myanmar)"] Burmese Ministry of Health, is most prevalent
 among sex workers and intravenous drug users. In 2005, the estimated adult HIV prevalence rate in
Myanmar was 1.3% (200,000–570,000 people),  according to UNAIDS, and early indicators of any
progress against the HIV epidemic are inconsistent.[349][350][351] However, the National AIDS Programme
Myanmar found that 32% of sex workers and 43% of intravenous drug users in Myanmar have HIV.[351]
Education
According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO"] UNESCO Institute of Statistics, Myanmar's
official [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_rate"] literacy rate as of 2000 was 90%.[352] Historically,
Myanmar has had high literacy rates. The educational system of
 Myanmar is operated by the government agency, the Ministry of
Education. The education system is based on the United Kingdom's
system after nearly a century of British and Christian presences in
Myanmar. Nearly all schools are government-operated, but there
has been an increase in privately funded English language schools
in the early 21st century. Schooling is compulsory until the end of
elementary school, approximately about 9 years old, while the
compulsory schooling age is 15 or 16 at international level.

 Global Innovation Index in 2021, up from 30th in 2019[354]
Crime
Myanmar had a murder rate of 15.2 per 100,000 population with a total of 8,044 murders in 2012.[355]
Factors influencing Myanmar's high murder rate include communal violence and armed conflict.[356]
 Myanmar is one of the world's most corrupt nations. The 2012 Transparency International Corruption
Perceptions Index ranked the country at number 171, out of 176 countries in total.[357] Myanmar is the
world's second largest producer of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium"] opium after Afghanistan, producing some 25% of the world's opium,
and forms part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Triangle_(Southeast_Asia)"] Golden Triangle. The opium industry was a monopoly during colonial times and has
since been illegally operated by corrupt officials in the Burmese military and rebel fighters,[358] primarily as
the basis for heroin manufacture. Myanmar is the largest producer of methamphetamines in the world, with
the majority of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ya_ba"] Ya ba found in Thailand produced in Myanmar, particularly in the Golden Triangle and
northeastern Shan State, which borders Thailand, Laos and China.[359] Burmese-produced ya ba is
typically trafficked to Thailand via Laos, before being transported through the northeastern Thai region of
Isan.[360]
Culture
A diverse range of indigenous cultures exist in Myanmar, with majority
culture primarily Buddhist and Bamar. Bamar culture has been influenced
by the cultures of neighbouring countries, manifested in its language,
cuisine, music, dance and theatre. The arts, particularly literature, have
historically been influenced by the local form of Theravada Buddhism.
Considered the national epic of Myanmar, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yama_Zatdaw"] Yama Zatdaw, an adaptation
of India's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana"] Ramayana,  has been influenced greatly by Thai, Mon, and
 Indian versions of the play.[361] Buddhism is practised along with nat
worship, which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon
of 37 nats.[362][363]
In a traditional village, the monastery is the centre of cultural life. Monks
are venerated and supported by the lay people. A novitiation ceremony
called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinbyu"] shinbyu is the most important [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_age"] coming of age events for a boy, during
which he enters the monastery for a short time.[364] All male children in
Buddhist families are encouraged to be a novice (beginner for Buddhism)
before the age of twenty and to be a monk after the age of twenty.
Girls have ear-piercing ceremonies (နားသ) at the same time.[364]
Burmese culture is most evident in villages where local festivals are
 held throughout the year, the most important being the pagoda
festival.[327][365] Many villages have a guardian nat, and
superstition and taboos are commonplace. 
Burmese [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinnara"] Kinnayi Kinnaya

British colonial rule introduced Western elements of culture to
Myanmar. Myanmar's education system is modelled after that of the
United Kingdom. Colonial architectural influences are most evident
in major cities such as Yangon.[366] Many ethnic minorities,

Page 32
Burman population is 68% and the ethnic groups constitute 32%. In
contrast, the exiled leaders and organisations claim the country is
40% ethnic.
Cuisine
 Burmese cuisine is characterised by extensive use of fish products
such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_sauce"] fish sauce, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngapi"] ngapi (fermented seafood) and dried prawn.
 Mohinga is the traditional breakfast dish and is Myanmar's national
dish. Seafood is a common ingredient in coastal cities, while meat
and poultry are more commonly used in landlocked cities like
Mandalay. Freshwater fish and shrimp have been incorporated into

inland cooking as a primary source of protein and are used in a
variety of ways, fresh, salted whole or filleted, salted and dried, made into a salty paste, or fermented sour
and pressed. Burmese cuisine also includes a variety of salads ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_thoke"] a thoke), centred on one major ingredient,
ranging from starches like rice, wheat and rice noodles, glass noodles and vermicelli, to potato, ginger,
tomato, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaffir_lime"] kaffir lime, long bean, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lahpet"] lahpet (pickled tea leaves).
Sport
The Lethwei, Bando, Banshay, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pongyi_thaing"] Pongyi thaing martial arts and
 chinlone are traditional sports in Myanmar.[368] Football is played
all over the country, even in villages, and its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar_national_football_team"] national team is ruled
 by the Myanmar Football Federation. The 2013 Southeast Asian
Games took place in Naypyidaw, Yangon, Mandalay and
 Ngwesaung Beach in December representing the third occasion
that the event has been staged in Myanmar. Myanmar previously
hosted the games in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1961_Southeast_Asian_Peninsular_Games"] 1961 and 1969.[369]
Art  Men playing chinlone
Burmese traditional art concepts are popular and respected by the
Burmese people and people from abroad. Burmese contemporary art has developed quite rapidly on its
own terms. Artists born after the 1980s have had greater chances of art practice outside the country.
One of the first to study western art was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ba_Nyan"] Ba Nyan. Together with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngwe_Gaing"] Ngwe Gaing and a handful of other
artists, they were the pioneers of western painting style. Later on most young children learned the concepts
from them. Some well known contemporary artists are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lun_Gywe"] Lun Gywe, Aung Kyaw Htet, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPP_Yei_Myint"] MPP Yei Myint,

Media and communications
Because of Myanmar's political climate, there are not many media companies in relation to the country's
population. Some are privately owned. All programming must meet with the approval of the censorship
board. The Burmese government announced on 20 August 2012 that it would stop censoring media before
publication. Following the announcement, newspapers and other outlets no longer required approved by
state censors; however, journalists in the country can still face consequences for what they write and
Page 33
say.[370] In April 2013, international media reports were published to relay the enactment of the media
liberalisation reforms that we announced in August 2012. For the first time in numerous decades, the
publication of privately owned newspapers commenced in the country.[371]
Internet
Internet use is estimated to be relatively low compared to other
countries.[372][373] Myanmar's internet used to be subject to
censorship, and authorities viewed e-mails and posts on Internet
blogs until 2012 when the government removed media censorship.
During the strict censorship days, activity at internet cafes was
regulated, and one blogger named [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarganar"] Zarganar was sentenced to
 prison for publishing a video of destruction caused by Cyclone
Nargis in 2008; Zarganar was released in October 2011.

In regards to communications infrastructure, Myanmar is the last Lake, 2010
 ranked Asian country in the World Economic Forum's Networked
Readiness Index (NRI) – an indicator for determining the
development level of a country's information and communication technologies. With 139 countries reported
on, Myanmar ranked number 133 overall in the 2016 NRI ranking.[374]
Film
Myanmar's first film was a documentary of the funeral of Tun Shein—a leading politician of the 1910s,
who campaigned for Burmese independence in London. The first Burmese [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film"] silent film Myitta Ne Thuya
([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_and_Liquor"] Love and Liquor) in 1920 which proved a major success, despite its poor quality due to a fixed camera
position and inadequate film accessories. During the 1920s and 1930s, many Burmese-owned film
companies made and produced several films. The first Burmese [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film"] sound film was produced in 1932 in
Bombay, India with the title Ngwe Pay Lo Ma Ya (Money Can't Buy It). After World War II, Burmese
cinema continued to address political themes. Many of the films produced in the early Cold War era had a
strong propaganda element to them.
In the era that followed the political events of 1988, the film industry has been increasingly controlled by
the government. Film stars who had been involved in the political activities were banned from appearing in
films. The government issues strict rules on censorship and largely determines who produces films, as well
as who gets academy awards.[375]
Over the years, the movie industry has also shifted to producing many lower-budget [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-to-video"] direct-to-video films.
Most of the movies produced nowadays are comedies.[376] In 2008, only 12 films worthy of being
considered for an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards"] Academy Award were made, although at least 800 VCDs were produced.[377] Myanmar
is the primary subject of a 2007 graphic novel titled Chroniques Birmanes by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_City"] Québécois author and
animator, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Delisle"] Guy Delisle. The graphic novel was translated into English under the title [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma_Chronicles"] Burma Chronicles in
2008. In 2009, a documentary about Burmese [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videojournalist"] videojournalists called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma_VJ"] Burma VJ was released.[378] This
film was nominated for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Documentary_Feature"] Best Documentary Feature at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/82nd_Academy_Awards"] 2010 Academy Awards.[379] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady_(2011_film)"] The Lady had its

in British English although only some British English speakers pronounce r at the end of
syllables. As [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Wells"] John Wells explains, the English spellings of both Myanmar and Burma
assume a non-rhotic variety of English, in which the letter r before a consonant or finally
serves merely to indicate a long vowel: [ˈmjænmɑː, ˈbɜːmə]. So the pronunciation of the last
syllable of Myanmar as [mɑːr] or of Burma as [bɜːrmə] by some speakers in the UK and all in
North America is in fact a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling_pronunciation"] spelling pronunciation based on a misunderstanding of non-rhotic
spelling conventions. The final r in Myanmar was not intended for pronunciation and is there
to ensure that the final a is pronounced with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_a"] broad ah ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ɑː/) in "father". If the Burmese
name မြန်မာ [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Burmese"] [mjəmà] were spelled "Myanma" in English, this would be pronounced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English"] /ə/ at the
