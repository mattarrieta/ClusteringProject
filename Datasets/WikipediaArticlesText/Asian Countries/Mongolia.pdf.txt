ulus;  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation"] lit. "Mongol Nation" or "State of Mongolia")  is a
 landlocked country in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia"] East Asia, bordered by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"] Russia [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia%E2%80%93Russia_border"] to the north
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"] China [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93Mongolia_border"] to the south. It covers an area of 1,564,116 square
kilometres (603,909 square miles), with a population of just 3.3
 million, making it the world's most sparsely populated sovereign
nation. Mongolia is the world's largest landlocked country that
does not border a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorheic_basin"] closed sea, and much of its area is covered by
 grassy steppe, with mountains to the north and west and the Gobi
Desert to the south. Ulaanbaatar, the capital and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Mongolia"] largest city, is
home to roughly half of the country's population.
The territory of modern-day Mongolia has been ruled by various
 nomadic empires, including the Xiongnu, the Xianbei, the
 Rouran, the First Turkic Khaganate, and others. In 1206, Genghis
Khan founded the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire"] Mongol Empire, which became the largest
 contiguous land empire in history. His grandson [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kublai_Khan"] Kublai Khan
conquered China to establish the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty"] Yuan dynasty. After the collapse
of the Yuan, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongols"] Mongols retreated to Mongolia and resumed
their earlier pattern of factional conflict, except during the era of
 Dayan Khan and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumen_Zasagt_Khan"] Tumen Zasagt Khan. In the 16th century,
 Tibetan Buddhism spread to Mongolia, being further led by the
Manchu-founded [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty"] Qing dynasty, which absorbed the country in
the 17th century. By the early 20th century, almost one-third of
the adult male population were Buddhist monks.[11][12] After the
 collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, Mongolia declared
 independence, and achieved actual independence from the
Republic of China in 1921. Shortly thereafter, the country
became a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_state"] satellite state of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"] Soviet Union, which had aided its
 independence from China. In 1924, the Mongolian People's
Republic was founded as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_state"] socialist state.[13] After the anti-
communist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989"] revolutions of 1989, Mongolia conducted its own
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_system"] peaceful democratic revolution in early 1990. This led to a multi-
party system, a new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Mongolia"] constitution of 1992, and transition to a
 market economy.
Approximately 30% of the population is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad"] nomadic or semi-
nomadic; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_culture_in_Mongolia"] horse culture remains integral. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism"] Buddhism is the majority
religion, with the nonreligious being the second-largest group.
 Islam is the second-largest religion, concentrated among ethnic
Kazakhs. Most citizens are ethnic Mongols, with roughly 5% of
the population being Kazakhs, Tuvans, and other minorities, who
are especially concentrated in the west. Mongolia is a member of

The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoit_Tsenkher_Cave_Rock_Art"] Khoit Tsenkher Cave[17] in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khovd_Province"] Khovd Province shows lively pink, brown, and red ochre paintings (dated to
20,000 years ago) of mammoths, lynx, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactrian_camel"] bactrian camels, and ostriches, earning it the nickname "the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lascaux"] Lascaux of
Mongolia". The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_figurines_of_Mal%27ta"] venus figurines of Mal'ta (21,000 years ago) testify to the level of Upper Paleolithic art in
northern Mongolia; Mal'ta is now part of Russia.Neolithic agricultural settlements (c. 5500–3500 BC), such as
those at Norovlin, Tamsagbulag, Bayanzag, and Rashaan Khad, predated the introduction of horse-riding
nomadism, a pivotal event in the history of Mongolia which became the dominant culture. Horse-riding
nomadism has been documented by archeological evidence in Mongolia during the Copper and Bronze Age
 Afanasevo culture (3500–2500 BC); this culture was active to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khangai_Mountains"] Khangai Mountains in Central Mongolia.
The wheeled vehicles found in the burials of the Afanasevans have been dated to before 2200 BC.[18] Pastoral
nomadism and metalworking became more developed with the later [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okunev_culture"] Okunev culture (2nd millennium BC),
 Andronovo culture (2300–1000 BC) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karasuk_culture"] Karasuk culture (1500–300 BC), culminating with the Iron Age
 Xiongnu Empire in 209 BC. Monuments of the pre-Xiongnu Bronze Age include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer_stone"] deer stones, keregsur
kurgans, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_Grave_Culture"] square slab tombs, and rock paintings.

Although cultivation of crops has continued since the Neolithic, agriculture has always remained small in scale
compared to pastoral nomadism. Agriculture may have first been introduced from the west or arose
independently in the region. The population during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_Age"] Copper Age has been described as mongoloid in the
east of what is now Mongolia, and as europoid in the west.[17] Tocharians (Yuezhi) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythians"] Scythians inhabited
western Mongolia during the Bronze Age. The mummy of a Scythian warrior, which is believed to be about
2,500 years old, was a 30- to 40-year-old man with blond hair; it was found in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altai_Mountains"] the Altai, Mongolia.[19] As
equine nomadism was introduced into Mongolia, the political center of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_Steppe"] Eurasian Steppe also shifted to
Mongolia, where it remained until the 18th century CE. The intrusions of northern pastoralists (e.g. the
Guifang, Shanrong, and Donghu) into China during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shang_dynasty"] Shang dynasty (1600–1046 BC) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_dynasty"] Zhou dynasty
(1046–256 BC) presaged the age of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomadic_empire"] nomadic empires.
 The concept of Mongolia as an independent power north of China is expressed in a letter sent by Emperor
Wen of Han to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laoshang_Chanyu"] Laoshang Chanyu in 162 BC (recorded in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanshu"] Hanshu):
The Emperor of China respectfully salutes the great Shan Yu (Chanyu) of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiongnu"] Hsiung-nu
(Xiongnu)...When my imperial predecessor erected the Great Wall, all the bowmen nations on the
north were subject to the Shan Yu; while the residents inside the wall, who wore the cap and sash,
were all under our government: and the myriads of the people, by following their occupations,
ploughing and weaving, shooting and hunting, were able to provide themselves with food and
clothing...Your letter says:--"The two nations being now at peace, and the two princes living in
harmony, military operations may cease, the troops may send their horses to graze, and prosperity
and happiness prevail from age to age, commencing, a new era of contentment and peace." That
is extremely gratifying to me...Should I, in concert with the Shan Yu, follow this course,
complying with the will of heaven, then compassion for the people will be transmitted from age to
age, and extended to unending generations, while the universe will be moved with admiration,
and the influence will be felt by neighbouring kingdoms inimical to the Chinese or the Hsiung-
nu...As the Hsiung-nu live in the northern regions, where the cold piercing atmosphere comes at
an early period, I have ordered the proper authorities to transmit yearly to the Shan Yu, a certain
amount of grain, gold, silks of the finer and coarser kinds, and other objects. Now peace prevails
all over the world; the myriads of the population are living in harmony, and I and the Shan Yu
alone are the parents of the people...After the conclusion of the treaty of peace throughout the
world, take notice, the Han will not be the first to transgress.[20]
Since prehistoric times, Mongolia has been inhabited by nomads who,
from time to time, formed great confederations that rose to power and
prominence. Common institutions were the office of the Khan, the
 Kurultai (Supreme Council),  left and right wings, imperial army
(Keshig) and the decimal military system. The first of these empires,
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiongnu"] Xiongnu of undetermined ethnicity, were brought together by
 Modu Shanyu to form a confederation in 209 BC. Soon they emerged
as the greatest threat to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Dynasty"] Qin Dynasty, forcing the latter to construct
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China"] Great Wall of China. It was guarded by up to almost 300,000
soldiers during Marshal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meng_Tian"] Meng Tian's tenure, as a means of defense
against the destructive Xiongnu raids. The vast Xiongnu empire (209
BC–93 AD) was followed by the Mongolic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianbei_state"] Xianbei empire (93–234 
7th-century artifacts found 180 km
(112 mi) from Ulaanbaatar.
AD), which also ruled more than the entirety of present-day Mongolia.
The Mongolic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouran"] Rouran Khaganate (330–555), of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xianbei"] Xianbei provenance was the first to use "Khagan" as an
imperial title. It ruled a massive empire before being defeated by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6kt%C3%BCrks"] Göktürks (555–745) whose empire was
even bigger.
Page 5
 The Göktürks laid siege to Panticapaeum, present-day Kerch, in 576. They were succeeded by the Uyghur
Khaganate (745–840) who were defeated by the Kyrgyz. The Mongolic Khitans, descendants of the Xianbei,
ruled Mongolia during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liao_Dynasty"] Liao Dynasty (907–1125), after which the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khamag_Mongol"] Khamag Mongol (1125–1206) rose to
prominence.
Lines 3–5 of the memorial inscription of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilge_Khagan"] Bilge Khagan (684–737) in central Mongolia summarizes the time of
the Khagans:
In battles they subdued the nations of all four sides of the world and suppressed them. They made
those who had heads bow their heads, and who had knees genuflect them. In the east up to the
Kadyrkhan common people, in the west up to the Iron Gate they conquered... These Khagans
were wise. These Khagans were great. Their servants were wise and great too. Officials were
honest and direct with people. They ruled the nation this way. This way they held sway over
them. When they died ambassadors from Bokuli Cholug (Baekje Korea), Tabgach (Tang China),
Tibet (Tibetan Empire),  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pannonian_Avars"] Avar (Avar Khaganate),  Rome (Byzantine Empire),  Kirgiz, Uch-
Kurykan, Otuz-Tatars, Khitans, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumo_Xi"] Tatabis came to the funerals. So many people came to mourn over
the great Khagans. They were famous Khagans.[21]
Middle Ages to early 20th century
In the chaos of the late 12th century, a chieftain named [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan"] Temüjin finally
succeeded in uniting the Mongol tribes between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchuria"] Manchuria and the
 Altai Mountains. In 1206, he took the title [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan#Name_and_title"] Genghis Khan, and waged
a series of military campaigns – renowned for their brutality and
 ferocity – sweeping through much of Asia, and forming the Mongol
Empire, the largest contiguous land empire in world history. Under his
successors it stretched from present-day [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"] Poland in the west to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea"] Korea in
the east, and from parts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia"] Siberia in the north to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Oman"] Gulf of Oman and
 Vietnam in the south, covering some 33,000,000 square kilometres
(13,000,000 sq mi),[22] (22% of Earth's total land area) and had a
population of over 100 million people (about a quarter of Earth's total
population at the time).  The emergence of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Mongolica"] Pax Mongolica also
significantly eased trade and commerce across Asia during its
height.[23][24] 
 Mongol Empire expansion (1206 till
1294)
After Genghis Khan's death, the empire was subdivided into four
kingdoms or Khanates. These eventually became quasi-independent
after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toluid_Civil_War"] Toluid Civil War (1260–1264), which broke out in a battle for
power following [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6ngke_Khan"] Möngke Khan's death in 1259. One of the khanates,
the "Great Khaanate", consisting of the Mongol homeland and most of
 modern-day China, became known as the Yuan dynasty under Kublai
Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan. He set up his capital in present- 
1236-1242 Mongol invasions of
Europe
day Beijing. After more than a century of power, the Yuan dynasty
was overthrown by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty"] Ming dynasty in 1368, and the Yuan court fled
to the north, thus becoming the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Yuan"] Northern Yuan dynasty. As the Ming armies pursued the Mongols into their
homeland, they successfully sacked and destroyed the Mongol capital [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karakorum"] Karakorum and other cities. Some of
these attacks were repelled by the Mongols under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biligt%C3%BC_Khan_Ayushiridara"] Ayushridar and his general [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%B6ke_Tem%C3%BCr"] Köke Temür.[25]
After the expulsion of the Yuan rulers from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_proper"] China proper, the Mongols continued to rule their homeland,
known in historiography as the Northern Yuan dynasty. The next centuries were marked by violent power
struggles among various factions, notably the Genghisids and the non-Genghisid Oirats, as well as by several

had occurred.) Abtai Khan of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalkha"] Khalkha converted to Buddhism and
founded the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdene_Zuu"] Erdene Zuu monastery in 1585. His grandson [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zanabazar"] Zanabazar
became the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebtsundamba_Khutughtu"] Jebtsundamba Khutughtu in 1640. Following the leaders, the
entire Mongolian population embraced Buddhism. Each family kept
scriptures and Buddha statues on an altar at the north side of their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yurt"] ger (yurt).
Mongolian nobles donated land, money and herders to the monasteries. As
was typical in states with established religions, the top religious institutions,
the monasteries, wielded significant temporal power in addition to spiritual
power.
Genghis Khan the first Mongol
Emperor 
The last Mongol Khan was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligden_Khan"] Ligden Khan in the early 17th century. He came
into conflicts with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people"] Manchus over the looting of Chinese cities, and also
 alienated most Mongol tribes. He died in 1634. By 1636 most Inner
 Mongolian tribes had submitted to the Manchus, who founded the Qing
dynasty. The Khalkha eventually submitted to Qing rule in 1691, thus bringing all of today's Mongolia under
Manchu rule. After several [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzungar%E2%80%93Qing_Wars"] Dzungar–Qing Wars, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzungars"] Dzungars (western Mongols or Oirats) were virtually
annihilated during the Qing conquest of Dzungaria in 1757 and 1758.[26]
 Some scholars estimate that about 80% of the 600,000 or more Dzungar were
destroyed by a combination of disease and warfare.[27] Outer Mongolia was
given relative autonomy, being administered by the hereditary Genghisid khanates
of Tusheet Khan, Setsen Khan, Zasagt Khan and Sain Noyon Khan. The
 Jebtsundamba Khutuktu of Mongolia had immense de facto authority. The
Manchu forbade mass Chinese immigration into the area, which allowed the
Mongols to keep their culture. The Oirats who migrated to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontic%E2%80%93Caspian_steppe"] Volga steppes in
Russia became known as Kalmyks.
The main trade route during this period was the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberian_Route"] Tea Road through Siberia; it had
permanent stations located every 25 to 30 kilometres (16 to 19 mi), each of which
was staffed by 5–30 chosen families.
Until 1911, the Qing dynasty maintained control of Mongolia with a series of
alliances and intermarriages, as well as military and economic measures. Ambans,
Manchu "high officials", were installed in Khüree, Uliastai, and Khovd, and the
country was divided into numerous feudal and ecclesiastical fiefdoms (which also
placed people in power with loyalty to the Qing). Over the course of the 19th
century, the feudal lords attached more importance to representation and less

importance to the responsibilities towards their subjects. The behaviour of Mongolia's nobility, together with
 usurious practices by Chinese traders and the collection of imperial taxes in silver instead of animals, resulted
in widespread poverty among the nomads. By 1911 there were 700 large and small monasteries in Outer
Mongolia; their 115,000 monks made up 21% of the population. Apart from the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, there
were 13 other reincarnating high lamas, called 'seal-holding saints' (tamgatai khutuktu), in Outer Mongolia.
Modern history
With the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, Mongolia under the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogd_Khaan"] Bogd Khaan
declared its independence. But the newly established [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949)"] Republic of China
 considered Mongolia to be part of its own territory. Yuan Shikai, the President
of the Republic of China, considered the new republic to be the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Successor_state"] successor of
the Qing. Bogd Khaan said that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qing_dynasty_in_Inner_Asia"] both Mongolia and China had been
administered by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_people"] Manchu during the Qing, and after the fall of the Qing
dynasty in 1911, the contract of Mongolian submission to the Manchu had
become invalid.[28][b]
The area controlled by the Bogd Khaan was approximately that of the former
 Outer Mongolia during the Qing period. In 1919, after the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution"] October Revolution
in Russia, Chinese troops led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord_Era"] warlord [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Shuzheng"] Xu Shuzheng occupied Mongolia.
Warfare erupted on the northern border. As a result of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War"] Russian Civil War,
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_movement"] White Russian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_General"] Lieutenant General [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Ungern_von_Sternberg"] Baron Ungern led his troops into
Mongolia in October 1920, defeating the Chinese forces in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulaanbaatar"] Niislel Khüree
(now Ulaanbaatar) in early February 1921 with Mongol support.
To eliminate the threat posed by Ungern, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_SFSR"] Bolshevik Russia decided to support
the establishment of a communist Mongolian government and army.
This Mongolian army took the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altanbulag,_Selenge"] Mongolian part of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyakhta"] Kyakhta from
Chinese forces on 18 March 1921, and on 6 July, Russian and
Mongolian troops arrived in Khüree. Mongolia declared its
independence again on 11 July 1921.[29] As a result, Mongolia was
closely aligned with the Soviet Union over the next seven decades.

 sources claim, at the hands of Russian spies,[31] the country's political

system was changed. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People%27s_Republic"] Mongolian People's Republic was established. In 1928, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khorloogiin_Choibalsan"] Khorloogiin Choibalsan
 rose to power. The early leaders of the Mongolian People's Republic (1921–1952) included many with Pan-
Mongolist ideals. However, changing global politics and increased Soviet pressure led to the decline of Pan-
Mongol aspirations in the following period.
Khorloogiin Choibalsan instituted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectivization"] collectivization of livestock, began the destruction of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism"] Buddhist
monasteries, and carried out [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalinist_repressions_in_Mongolia"] Stalinist purges, which resulted in the murders of numerous monks and other
leaders. In Mongolia during the 1920s, approximately one-third of the male population were monks. By the
beginning of the 20th century, about 750 monasteries were functioning in Mongolia.[32]
In 1930, the Soviet Union stopped [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buryats"] Buryat migration to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People%27s_Republic"] Mongolian People's Republic to prevent Mongolian
reunification. All leaders of Mongolia who did not fulfill [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin"] Stalin's demands to perform [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Terror"] Red Terror against
Mongolians were executed, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peljidiin_Genden"] Peljidiin Genden and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandyn_Amar"] Anandyn Amar. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Purge"] Stalinist purges in Mongolia,
Page 8
which began in 1937, killed more than 30,000 people. Choibalsan died
suspiciously in the Soviet Union in 1952. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comintern"] Comintern leader [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohum%C3%ADr_%C5%A0meral"] Bohumír Šmeral said,
"People of Mongolia are not important, the land is important. Mongolian land is
larger than England, France and Germany".[33]
 Khorloogiin Choibalsan
led Mongolia during the
 Stalinist era and
presided over an
environment of intense
political persecution 
 After the Japanese invasion of
neighboring Manchuria in  1931,
Mongolia was threatened on this front.
During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Khalkhin_Gol"] Soviet-Japanese Border War
of 1939, the Soviet Union successfully
defended Mongolia against Japanese
expansionism. Mongolia fought against
Japan during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Khalkhin_Gol"] Battles of Khalkhin Gol
 in 1939 and during the Soviet–Japanese
 War in August 1945 to liberate Inner
Mongolia from Japan and Mengjiang.[34]

The February 1945 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference"] Yalta Conference provided for the Soviet Union's participation in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War"] Pacific War. One of
the Soviet conditions for its participation, put forward at Yalta, was that after the war Outer Mongolia would
retain its independence. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1945_Mongolian_independence_referendum"] The referendum took place on 20 October 1945, with (according to official numbers)
100% of the electorate voting for independence.[35]
After the establishment of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China"] People's Republic of China, both countries confirmed their mutual recognition
on 6 October 1949. However, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China"] Republic of China used its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_veto_power"] Security Council veto in 1955, to stop the
admission of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People%27s_Republic"] Mongolian People's Republic to the United Nations on the grounds it recognized all of
Mongolia —including Outer Mongolia— as part of China. This was the only time the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_China_and_the_United_Nations"] Republic of China ever
used its veto. Hence, and because of the repeated threats to veto by the ROC, Mongolia did not join the UN
until 1961 when the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"] Soviet Union agreed to lift its veto on the admission of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania"] Mauritania (and any other newly
independent African state), in return for the admission of Mongolia. Faced with pressure from nearly all the
other African countries, the ROC relented under protest. Mongolia and Mauritania were both admitted to the
UN on 27 October 1961.[36][37][38] (see [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_the_United_Nations"] China and the United Nations)
On 26 January 1952, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yumjaagiin_Tsedenbal"] Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal took power in Mongolia after the
death of Choibalsan. Tsedenbal was the leading political figure in Mongolia for
more than 30 years.[39] While Tsedenbal was visiting Moscow in August 1984,
his severe illness prompted the parliament to announce his retirement and replace
him with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambyn_Batm%C3%B6nkh"] Jambyn Batmönkh.
Post-Cold War
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Soviet_Union"] fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 strongly influenced Mongolian politics and
youth. Its people undertook the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_Revolution_of_1990"] peaceful Democratic Revolution in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutions_of_1989"] January 1990
and the introduction of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_system"] multi-party system and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy"] market economy. At the same
 time, the transformation of the former Marxist-Leninist Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party to the current social democratic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People%27s_Party"] Mongolian People's Party
reshaped the country's political landscape.

1990s the country had to deal with high inflation and food shortages.[40] The first election victories for non-

communist parties came in 1993 (presidential elections) and 1996 (parliamentary elections).  China has
 supported Mongolia's application for membership in to the Asia Cooperation Dialogue (ACD), Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) and granting it [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_status"] observer status in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation"] Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.[41]
Geography and climate
 At 1,564,116 km2 (603,909 sq mi), Mongolia is the world's 18th-
largest country (after Iran).[42] It is significantly larger than the next-
largest country, Peru. It mostly lies between latitudes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/41st_parallel_north"] 41° and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52nd_parallel_north"] 52°N (a
small area is north of 52°), and longitudes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/87th_meridian_east"] 87° and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/120th_meridian_east"] 120°E. As a point
of reference the northernmost part of Mongolia is on roughly the same
latitude as Berlin (Germany) and Saskatoon (Canada),  while the
southernmost part is on roughly the same latitude as Rome (Italy) and
Chicago (USA). The westernmost part of Mongolia is on roughly the
same longitude as Kolkata in India, while the easternmost part is on the
same longitude as Qinhuangdao and Hangzhou in China, as well as
the western edge of Taiwan. Although Mongolia does not share a
border with Kazakhstan, its westernmost point is only 36.76 kilometres
(22.84 mi) from Kazakhstan. 
The southern portion of Mongolia is
taken up by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobi_Desert"] Gobi Desert, while
the northern and western portions are
mountainous.
The geography of Mongolia is varied, with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobi_Desert"] Gobi Desert to the
 south and cold, mountainous regions to the north and west. Much of Mongolia consists of the Mongolian-
Manchurian grassland steppe, with forested areas accounting for 11.2% of the total land area,[43] a higher
percentage than Ireland (10%).[44] The whole of Mongolia is considered to be part of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_Plateau"] Mongolian Plateau.
The highest point in Mongolia is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh%C3%BCiten_Peak"] Khüiten Peak in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavan_bogd"] Tavan bogd massif in the far west at 4,374 m
(14,350 ft). The basin of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uvs_Lake"] Uvs Lake, shared with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuva_Republic"] Tuva Republic in Russia, is a natural [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site"] World Heritage Site.
Climate
Mongolia is known as the "Land of the Eternal Blue Sky" or "Country of Blue Sky" (Mongolian: "Mönkh
khökh tengeriin oron") because it has over 250 sunny days a year.[45][46][47][48]
Most of the country is hot in the summer and extremely cold in the
winter, with January averages dropping as low as −30 °C (−22 °F).[49]
A vast front of cold, heavy, shallow air comes in from Siberia in winter
and collects in river valleys and low basins causing very cold
temperatures while slopes of mountains are much warmer due to the
effects of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature_inversion"] temperature inversion (temperature increases with altitude).
Mongolia map of Köppen climate
classification zones.  In winter the whole of Mongolia comes under the influence of the
 Siberian Anticyclone. The localities most severely affected by this cold
weather are Uvs province (Ulaangom),  western Khovsgol
(Rinchinlhumbe), eastern Zavkhan (Tosontsengel), northern Bulgan (Hutag) and eastern Dornod province
(Khalkhiin Gol). Ulaanbaatar is strongly, but less severely, affected. The cold gets less severe as one goes
south, reaching the warmest January temperatures in Omnogovi Province (Dalanzadgad, Khanbogd) and the
region of the Altai mountains bordering China. A unique microclimate is the fertile grassland-forest region of
central and eastern Arkhangai Province (Tsetserleg) and northern Ovorkhangai Province (Arvaikheer) where
January temperatures are on average the same and often higher than the warmest desert regions to the south in
addition to being more stable. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khangai_Mountains"] Khangai Mountains play a certain role in forming this microclimate. In
Tsetserleg, the warmest town in this microclimate, nighttime January temperatures rarely go under −30 °C
(−22 °F) while daytime January temperatures often reach 0 °C (32 °F) to 5 °C (41 °F).[50][51]
Page 10
The country is subject to occasional harsh climatic conditions known
as zud. Zud, a natural disaster unique to Mongolia, results in large
proportions of the country's livestock dying from starvation or freezing
temperatures or both, resulting in economic upheaval for the largely
pastoral population. The annual average temperature in Ulaanbaatar is
−1.3 °C (29.7 °F),  making it the world's coldest capital city.[49]
Mongolia is high, cold and windy.[52] It has an extreme continental
climate with long, cold winters and short summers, during which most
of its annual precipitation falls.[52] The country averages 257 cloudless
days a year, and it is usually at the center of a region of high
atmospheric pressure.[52] Precipitation is highest in the north (average

which receives 100 to 200 millimeters (4 to 8 in) annually.[52] The
highest annual precipitation of 622.297 mm (24.500 in) occurred in the
forests of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgan_Province"] Bulgan Province near the border with Russia and the lowest of 41.735 mm (1.643 in) occurred in the
Gobi Desert (period 1961–1990).[53] The sparsely populated far north of Bulgan Province averages 600 mm
(24 in) in annual precipitation which means it receives more precipitation than Beijing (571.8 mm or 22.51 in)
or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin"] Berlin (571 mm or 22.5 in).
Environmental issues
There are many pressing environmental issues in Mongolia that are detrimental to both human and
environmental wellness. These problems have arisen in part due to natural factors, but increasingly because of
human actions. One of these issues is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change"] climate change, which will be responsible for an increase in
desertification, natural disasters, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_degradation"] land degradation.[54] Another is deforestation, which is expanding due to
human recklessness, pests, disease, and fires. Mongolian lands are becoming more arid through desertification,
a process that is being exacerbated due to irresponsible [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use"] land use. Additionally, more and more species are
disappearing and at risk for extinction. Moreover, especially in population centers, Mongolians deal with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution"] air
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution"] water pollution caused by industrialization.
Wildlife
The name "Gobi" is a Mongol term for a desert steppe, which usually
refers to a category of arid rangeland with insufficient vegetation to
support [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmot"] marmots but with enough to support camels.[52] Mongols
distinguish Gobi from desert proper, although the distinction is not
always apparent to outsiders unfamiliar with the Mongolian
landscape.[52]
Gobi rangelands are fragile and easily destroyed by overgrazing,
which results in expansion of the true desert, a stony waste where not
even [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bactrian_camel"] Bactrian camels can survive.[52] The arid conditions in the Gobi
are attributed to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_shadow_effect"] rain shadow effect caused by the Himalayas.
Before the Himalayas were formed by the collision of the Indo-
Australian plate with the Eurasian plate 10 million years ago,
Mongolia was a flourishing habitat for major fauna but still somewhat
arid and cold due to distance from sources of evaporation. Sea turtle
and mollusk fossils have been found in the Gobi, apart from well-
known dinosaur fossils. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadpole_shrimps"] Tadpole shrimps (Lepidurus mongolicus) are
still found in the Gobi today. The eastern part of Mongolia including
 the Onon and Kherlen rivers and Lake Buir form part of the Amur
river basin draining to the Pacific Ocean. It hosts some unique species 
 Bactrian camels by sand dunes in
Gobi Desert.

like the Eastern brook lamprey, Daurian crayfish (cambaroides dauricus) and Daurian pearl oyster (dahurinaia
dahurica) in the Onon/Kherlen rivers as well as Siberian prawn (exopalaemon modestus) in Lake Buir.
Mongolia had a 2019 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Landscape_Integrity_Index"] Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 9.36/10, ranking it sixth globally out of
172 countries.[55]
Demographics
Mongolia's total population as of January 2015 was estimated by the
 U.S. Census Bureau[56] to be 3,000,251 people, ranking around 121st
 in the world. But the U.S. Department of State Bureau of East Asian
and Pacific Affairs uses the United Nations (UN) estimations[57]
 instead of the U.S. Census Bureau estimations. United Nations
Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division[58]
estimates Mongolia's total population (mid-2007) as 2,629,000 (11%
less than the U.S. Census Bureau figure). UN estimates resemble those
made by the Mongolian National Statistical Office (2,612,900, end of
June 2007). Mongolia's population growth rate is estimated at 1.2%
(2007 est.).[58] About 59% of the total population is under age 30,
27% of whom are under 14. This relatively [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_in_Mongolia"] young and growing
population has placed strains on Mongolia's economy. 
 Ulaanbaatar is the capital and largest
city of Mongolia
The first census in the 20th century was carried out in 1918 and
recorded a population of 647,500.[59] Since the end of socialism,
Mongolia has experienced a decline of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate"] total fertility rate (children per
woman) that is steeper than in any other country in the world,
according to recent UN estimations:[58] in 1970–1975, fertility was
estimated to be 7.33 children per woman, dropping to about 2.1 in
2000–2005.[60] The decline ended and in 2005–2010, the estimated
fertility value increased to 2.5 and stabilised afterwards at the rate of
about 2.2–2.3 children per woman. 
In settlements, many families live in
 ger districts
Ethnic Mongols account for about 95% of the population and consist of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalkha"] Khalkha and other groups, all
distinguished primarily by dialects of the Mongol language. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalkha"] Khalkha make up 86% of the ethnic Mongol
population. The remaining 14% include Oirats, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buryats"] Buryats and others. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkic_people"] Turkic peoples ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhs"] Kazakhs and Tuvans)
constitute 4.5% of Mongolia's population, and the rest are Russian, Chinese, Korean and American
nationalities.[61]
Languages
The official language of Mongolia is Mongolian, and is spoken by 95% of the population. A variety of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialect"] dialects
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oirat_language"] Oirat and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buryat_language"] Buryat are spoken across the country, and there are also some speakers of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolic_language"] Mongolic Khamnigan.
 In the west of the country, Kazakh and Tuvan, both Turkic languages, are also spoken. Mongolian Sign
Language is the principal language of the deaf community.
Today, Mongolian is written using the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_alphabet"] Cyrillic alphabet in Mongolia, although in the past it was written using
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_script"] Mongolian script. An official reintroduction of the old script was planned for 1994, but has not taken place
as older generations encountered practical difficulties.[62] Schools are reintroducing the traditional alphabet.[63]
In March 2020, the Mongolian government announced plans to use both Cyrillic and the traditional Mongolian
script in official documents by 2025.[64][65]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Department_of_State"]

 Russian is the most frequently spoken foreign language in Mongolia, followed by English, although English
has been gradually replacing Russian as the second language. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language"] Korean has gained popularity as tens of
thousands of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolians_in_South_Korea"] Mongolians work in South Korea.[66]
Religion
According to the 2010 National Census, among Mongolians aged
 15 and above, 53% were Buddhists, while 39% were non-
religious.
 Mongolian shamanism has been widely practised throughout the
history of what is now Mongolia, with similar beliefs being
common among the nomads of central Asia. They gradually gave
way to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism"] Tibetan Buddhism, but shamanism has left a mark on
Mongolian religious culture, and it continues to be practiced. The
Kazakhs of western Mongolia, some Mongols, and other Turkic
peoples in the country traditionally adhere to Islam.

Throughout much of the 20th century, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People%27s_Republic"] communist government Other religions 6,933  0.4%
repressed religious practices. It targeted the clergy of the Total  1,905,566 100.0%
Mongolian Buddhist Church, which had been tightly intertwined
with the previous feudal government structures (e.g. from 1911 on, the head of the Church had also been the
 Khan of the country).[68] In the late 1930s, the regime, then led by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khorloogiin_Choibalsan"] Khorloogiin Choibalsan, closed almost all
 of Mongolia's over 700 Buddhist monasteries and killed at least 30,000 people, of whom 18,000 were
lamas.[69] The number of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_monk"] Buddhist monks dropped from 100,000 in 1924 to 110 in 1990.[68]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_communism"] fall of communism in 1991 restored public religious practice.
 Tibetan Buddhism, which had been the predominant religion prior to
the rise of communism, again rose to become the most widely
practised religion in Mongolia. The end of religious repression in the
1990s also allowed for other religions to spread in the country.
According to the Christian missionary group [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnabas_Fund"] Barnabas Fund, the
number of Christians grew from just four in 1989 to around 40,000 as
 Amarbayasgalant Monastery of 2008. In May 2013, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints"] The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
(LDS Church) held a cultural program to celebrate twenty years of
LDS Church history in Mongolia, with 10,900 members, and 16
church buildings in the country.[70] There are some 1,000 Catholics in Mongolia and, in 2003, a missionary
from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines"] Philippines was named Mongolia's first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church"] Catholic bishop.[71] In 2017 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventists"] Seventh-day Adventists reported
2,700 members in six churches up from zero members in 1991.[72]
Government and politics
Mongolia is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-presidential_system"] semi-presidential [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy"] representative democratic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic"] republic with a directly elected President.[73][74][3]
The people also elect the deputies in the national assembly, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Great_Khural"] State Great Khural. The president appoints the
prime minister, and nominates the cabinet on the proposal of the prime minister. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Mongolia"] constitution of Mongolia
guarantees a number of freedoms, including full [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_expression"] freedom of expression and religion. Mongolia has a number of
political parties; the largest are the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People%27s_Party"] Mongolian People's Party and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(Mongolia)"] Democratic Party. The non-governmental
organisation [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_House"] Freedom House considers Mongolia to be free.[75]
The People's Party – known as the People's Revolutionary Party between 1924 and 2010 – formed the
government from 1921 to 1996 (in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state"] one-party system until 1990) and from 2000 to 2004. From 2004 to 2006,
it was part of a coalition with the Democrats and two other parties, and after 2006 it was the dominant party in
Page 13
two other coalitions. The party initiated two changes of government
from 2004 prior to losing power in the 2012 election. The Democrats
were the dominant force in a ruling coalition between 1996 and 2000,
and an almost-equal partner with the People's Revolutionary Party in a
coalition between 2004 and 2006. An election of deputies to the
national assembly on 28 June 2012 resulted in no party having an
overall majority;[76] however, as the Democratic Party won the largest
number of seats,[77] its leader, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norovyn_Altankhuyag"] Norovyn Altankhuyag, was appointed
 State Great Khural chamber in
session 
 prime minister on 10 August 2012.[78] In 2014, he was replaced by
 Chimediin Saikhanbileg. The MPP won a landslide victory in the 2016
 elections and the next Prime Minister was MPP's Ukhnaagiin
Khürelsükh. In June 2020, MPP won a landslide victory in the
election. It took 62 seats and the main opposition DP, 11 of the 76 seats. Before the elections the ruling party
had redrawn the electoral map in a way that was beneficial for MPP.[79]In January 2021, Prime Minister
Ukhnaagiin Khürelsükh resigned after protests over the treatment of a coronavirus patient.[80] On 27 January
2021, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luvsannamsrain_Oyun-Erdene"] Luvsannamsrai Oyun-Erdene of MPP became new prime minister. He represents a younger generation
of leaders that had studied abroad.[81] 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Mongolia"] President of Mongolia is able to veto the laws made by
parliament, appoint judges and justice of courts and appoint
ambassadors. The parliament can override that veto by a two-thirds
majority vote. Mongolia's constitution provides three requirements for
taking office as president; the candidate must be a native-born
Mongolian, be at least 45 years old, and have resided in Mongolia for
five years before taking office. The president must also suspend their
party membership. After defeating incumbent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambaryn_Enkhbayar"] Nambaryn Enkhbayar,

 Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, a two-time former prime minister and member
of the Democratic Party, was elected as president on 24 May 2009 and
inaugurated on 18 June that year.[82] The ruling Mongolian People's
Revolutionary Party (MPRP) nominated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batbold_Sukhbaatar"] Batbold Sukhbaatar as new
Prime Minister in October 2009.[83] Elbegdorj was re-elected on 26
June 2013 and was inaugurated on 10 July 2013 for his second term as president.[84] In June 2017, opposition
Democratic Party candidate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaltmaagiin_Battulga"] Khaltmaagiin Battulga won the presidential election.[85] He was inaugurated on
10 July 2017.[86]
In June 2021, former Prime Minister [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukhnaagiin_Kh%C3%BCrels%C3%BCkh"] Ukhnaa Khurelsukh, the candidate of the ruling Mongolian People's
 Party (MPP),  became the country's sixth democratically elected president after winning the presidential
election.[87]
Mongolia uses a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicameralism"] unicameral legislature, the State Great Khural, with 76 seats, which is chaired by the Speaker
of the House. Its members are directly elected, every four years, by popular vote.[3]
Foreign relations
 Mongolia's foreign relations traditionally focus on its two large neighbors, Russia and the People's Republic of
China.[88] Mongolia is economically dependent on these countries: China receives 90% of Mongolia's exports
by value and accounts for 60% of its foreign trade, while Russia supplies 90% of Mongolia's energy
requirements.[4] It has begun seeking positive relations with a wider range of other nations especially in
cultural and economic matters, focusing on encouraging foreign investments and trade.[89]

Economy
Economic activity in Mongolia has long been based on herding and
agriculture, although development of extensive mineral deposits of
copper, coal, molybdenum, tin, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tungsten"] tungsten and gold have emerged as a
driver of industrial production.[97] Besides mining (21.8% of GDP)
and agriculture (16% of GDP), dominant industries in the composition
of GDP are wholesale and retail trade and service, transportation and
storage, and real estate activities.[97] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_economy"] informal economy is
estimated to be at least one-third the size of the official economy.[97]
As of 2006, 68.4% of Mongolia's exports went to the PRC, and the
PRC supplied 29.8% of Mongolia's imports.[98] 
Historical development of real GDP
per capita in Mongolia
 Mongolia is ranked as lower-middle-income economy by the World
Bank.[99] Some 22.4% of the population lives on less than [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"] US$1.25 a
day.[100] In 2011, GDP per capita was $3,100.[4] Despite growth, the
proportion of the population below the poverty line was estimated to
be 35.6% in 1998, 36.1% in 2002–2003, and 32.2% in 2006.[101]
Because of a boom in the mining sector, Mongolia had high growth
rates in 2007 and 2008 (9.9% and 8.9%, respectively).[97] In 2009,
sharp drops in commodity prices and the effects of the global financial
crisis caused the local currency to drop 40% against the U.S. dollar.
Two of the 16 commercial banks were taken into receivership.[97] In
2011, GDP growth was expected to reach 16.4%. However, inflation
continued to erode GDP gains, with an average rate of 12.6%
expected at the end of 2011.[97] Although GDP has risen steadily since
2002 at the rate of 7.5% in an official 2006 estimate, the state is still
working to overcome a sizable trade deficit. The Economist predicted
this trade deficit of 14% of Mongolia's GDP would transform into a
surplus in 2013.[102]

Mongolia was never listed among the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_market"] emerging market countries until
February 2011 when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup"] Citigroup analysts determined Mongolia to be
one of the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G_(countries)"] global growth generating" countries, which are countries
with the most promising growth prospects for 2010–2050.[103] The

listed with a total market capitalization of US$2 billion after quadrupling from US$406 million in 2008.[106]
Mongolia made a significant improvement in the ease of doing business in 2012, ranking 76th compared with
88th the previous year in the "Doing Business" report by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Finance_Corporation"] International Finance Corporation (IFC).[107]
Mineral industry
Minerals represent more than 80% of Mongolia's exports, a proportion expected to eventually rise to 95%.
Fiscal revenues from mining represented 21% of government income in 2010 and rose to 24% in
2018.[109][110] About 3,000 mining licences have been issued.[102] Mining continues to rise as a major
Page 17
industry of Mongolia as evidenced by the number of Chinese, Russian
and Canadian firms starting mining businesses in Mongolia.[4]
In 2009, the government negotiated an "investment agreement" with
 Rio Tinto and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turquoise_Hill_Resources"] Ivanhoe Mines to develop the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyu_Tolgoi"] Oyu Tolgoi copper and
gold deposit,[97] the biggest foreign-investment project in Mongolia,
expected to account for one-third of Mongolia's GDP by 2020.[102] In
 March 2011, six big mining companies prepared to bid for the Tavan
Tolgoi area, the world's largest untapped coal deposit. According to 
 Oyu Tolgoi employs 18,000 workers
and expects to be producing 450,000
Erdenes MGL, the government body in-charge of Tavan Tolgoi, tonnes of copper a year by 2020[108]

consortium of Japanese, South Korean and Russian firms are the preferred bidders.[111]
Agriculture
 Agriculture in Mongolia constitutes over 10% of
Mongolia's annual [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product"] Gross domestic product and
employs one-third of the labor force.[112] However,
the high altitude, extreme fluctuation in
temperature, long winters, and low precipitation
provides limited potential for agricultural
development. The growing season is only 95 – 110
days.[113] Because of Mongolia's harsh climate, it is
unsuited to most cultivation.
The agriculture sector therefore remains heavily
focused on nomadic animal husbandry with 75% of
the land allocated to pasture, and cropping only
employing 3% of the population. In 2002, about
30% of all households in Mongolia lived from
breeding livestock.[114] Most herders in Mongolia
follow a pattern of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomads"] nomadic or semi-nomadic
pastoralism.
Crops produced in Mongolia include corn, wheat,
barley, and potatoes. Animals raised commercially
in Mongolia include sheep, goats, cattle, horses,
camels, and pigs. They are raised primarily for their
meat, although goats are valued for their hair which
can be used to produce cashmere. Due to the severe
2009–2010 winter, Mongolia lost 9.7 million
animals, or 22% of total livestock. This immediately
affected meat prices, which increased twofold; the
GDP dropped 1.6% in 2009.[115] 
Mongolian landscape
Infrastructure
Communications
Page 18
Telecommunications in Mongolia face unique challenges. As the least densely populated country in the world,
with a significant portion of the population living a nomadic lifestyle, it has been difficult for many traditional
 information and communication technology (ICT) companies to make headway into Mongolian society. With
almost half the population clustered in the capital of Ulaanbaatar, most landline technologies are deployed
there. Wireless technologies have had greater success in rural areas.
Mobile phones are common, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Mongolia"] provincial capitals all having [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G"] 4G access. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_local_loop"] Wireless local loop is another
technology that has helped Mongolia increase accessibility to telecommunications and bypass fixed-line
infrastructure.
For Internet, Mongolia relies on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fibers"] fiber optic communications with its Chinese and Russian neighbors.
In 2005 Mongolia's state-run radio and TV provider converted to a public service provider. Private radio and
TV broadcasters, multi-channel satellite, and cable TV providers are also available.[116]
Postal services are provided by state-owned [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Post"] Mongol Post and 54 other licensed operators.[117]
Energy
Mongolia had a total [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_energy"] primary energy supply (TPES) of 6.66 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne_of_oil_equivalent"] Mtoe in 2019. Electricity consumption was 7.71
TWh.[118] Mongolia is a big producer of coal, which is mostly exported.[119] Domestic consumption of coal
accounts for about 70% of Mongolia's primary energy and makes up most of the electricity generation,
accounting for about 87% of the domestic electricity production in 2019.[118]
Transportation
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Mongolian_Railway"] Trans-Mongolian Railway is the main rail link between Mongolia
and its neighbors. It begins at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Siberian_Railway"] Trans-Siberian Railway in Russia at
the town of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulan-Ude"] Ulan-Ude, crosses into Mongolia, runs through
Ulaanbaatar, then passes into China at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erenhot"] Erenhot where it joins the
Chinese railway system. A separate railroad link connects the eastern
city of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choibalsan_(city)"] Choibalsan with the Trans-Siberian Railway. However, that link
is closed to passengers after the Mongolian town of
Chuluunkhoroot.[120]

Mongolia has a number of domestic airports, with some of them
having international status. However, the main international airport is
 Chinggis Khaan International Airport, located approximately 52 km
(32 mi) south of the capital Ulaanbaatar. Direct flight connections exist
between Mongolia and South Korea, China, Thailand, Hong Kong,
Japan, Russia, Germany, and Turkey. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIAT_Mongolian_Airlines"] MIAT Mongolian Airlines is
Mongolia's national air carrier, operating international flights, while air
carriers such as Aero Mongolia and Hunnu Airlines serve domestic
and short international routes. 
While the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_horse"] Mongolian horse continues
to be revered as the national symbol,
they are rapidly being replaced by
motorized vehicles.
Many overland roads in Mongolia are only gravel roads or simple
cross-country tracks. There are paved roads from Ulaanbaatar to the
Russian and Chinese borders, from Ulaanbaatar east- and westward (the so-called Millennium Road), and
from Darkhan to Bulgan. A number of road construction projects are currently underway. Mongolia has
4,800 km (3,000 mi) of paved roads, with 1,800 km (1,100 mi) of that total completed in 2013 alone.[121]
Education
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal"]
Page 19
During the state socialist period, education was one of the areas of
significant achievement in Mongolia. Before the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_People%27s_Republic"] People's Republic,
literacy rates were below one percent. By 1952, illiteracy was virtually
eliminated,[122] in part through the use of seasonal boarding schools
for children of nomadic families. Funding to these boarding schools
was cut in the 1990s, contributing to slightly increased illiteracy.
Primary and secondary education formerly lasted ten years, but was
expanded to eleven years. Since the 2008–2009 school year, new first-
graders are using the 12-year system, with a full transition to the 12-
year system in the 2019–2020 school year.[123]
As of 2006, English is taught in all secondary schools across
Mongolia, beginning in fourth grade.

 Mongolian national universities are all spin-offs from the National University of Mongolia and the Mongolian
University of Science and Technology. Almost three in five Mongolian youths now enroll in university. There
 was a six-fold increase in students between 1993 and 2010.[124] Mongolia was ranked 58th in the Global
Innovation Index in 2021, down from 53rd in 2019.[125][126][127][128]
Health
Modern Mongolia inherited a relatively good healthcare system from its socialist period, a world bank report
from 2007 notes "despite its low per capita income, Mongolia has relatively strong health indicators; a
reflection of the important health gains achieved during the socialist period." On average Mongolia's infant
mortality rate is less than half of that of similarly economically developed countries, its under-five mortality rate
and life expectancy are all better on average than other nations with similar GDP per capita.
Since 1990, key health indicators in Mongolia like life expectancy and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infant_mortality"] infant and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_mortality"] child mortality have steadily
improved, both due to social changes and to improvement in the health sector. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinococcosis"] Echinococcosis was one of the
commonest surgical diagnoses in the 1960s, but now has been greatly reduced. Yet, adult health deteriorated
during the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century and mortality rates increased significantly. Smallpox,
typhus, plague, poliomyelitis, and diphtheria were eradicated by 1981. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_Red_Cross_Society"] Mongolian Red Cross Society
focuses on preventive work. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation_of_Mongolian_Trade_Unions"] Confederation of Mongolian Trade Unions established a network of
sanatoriums.
 Serious problems remain, especially in the countryside. According to a 2011 study by the World Health
Organization, Mongolia's capital city, Ulaanbaatar, has the second highest level of fine particle pollution of any
city in the world. Poor air quality is also the largest occupational hazard, as over two-thirds of occupational
disease in Mongolia is dust induced chronic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis"] bronchitis or pneumoconiosis.
Average childbirth ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertility_rate"] fertility rate) is around 2.25–1.87 per woman (2007) and average [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy"] life expectancy is 68.5
years (2011). Infant mortality is at 1.9% to 4% and child mortality is at 4.3%.
Culture
The symbol in the left bar of the national flag is a Buddhist icon called Soyombo. It represents the sun, moon,
stars, and heavens per standard cosmological symbology abstracted from that seen in traditional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thangka"] thangka
paintings.
Visual arts
Page 20
Before the 20th century, most works of the fine arts in Mongolia had a religious function, and therefore
Mongolian fine arts were heavily influenced by religious texts.[129] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thangkas"] Thangkas were usually painted or made in
 appliqué technique. Bronze sculptures usually showed Buddhist deities. A number of great works are
attributed to the first [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebtsundamba_Khutuktu"] Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, Zanabazar.
In the late 19th century, painters like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marzan_Sharav"] "Marzan" Sharav turned to more realistic painting styles. Under the
 Mongolian People's Republic, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_realism"] socialist realism was the dominant painting style,[130] however traditional
 thangka-like paintings dealing with secular, nationalist themes were also popular, a genre known as "Mongol
zurag".
Among the first attempts to introduce [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism"] modernism into the fine arts of Mongolia was the painting Ehiin setgel
(Mother's love) created by Tsevegjav in the 1960s. The artist was purged as his work was censored.
All forms of fine arts flourished only after "Perestroika" in the late 1980s. Otgonbayar Ershuu is arguably one
of the most well-known Mongolian modern artists in the Western world, he was portrayed in the film
"ZURAG" by Tobias Wulff.[131]
Architecture 
The traditional Mongolian dwelling is known as a ger. In the past it
was known by the Russian term yurt, but this has been changing as the
Mongolian term becomes better known in English-speaking countries.
According to Mongolian artist and art critic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=N._Chultem&action=edit&redlink=1"] N. Chultem, the ger was
the basis for development of traditional Mongolian architecture. In the
16th and 17th centuries, lamaseries were built throughout the country.
 A ger in front of the Gurvan Saikhan
Mountains 
Many of them started as ger-temples. When they needed to be
enlarged to accommodate the growing number of worshippers, the
Mongolian architects used structures with 6 and 12 angles with
pyramidal roofs to approximate to the round shape of a ger. Further
enlargement led to a quadratic shape of the temples. The roofs were
made in the shape of marquées.[132] The trellis walls, roof poles and layers of felt were replaced by stone,
brick, beams and planks, and became permanent.[133]
Chultem distinguished three styles in traditional Mongolian architecture: Mongolian, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_architecture"] Tibetan and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_architecture"] Chinese as
well as combinations of the three. Among the first quadratic temples was Batu-Tsagaan (1654) designed by
Zanabazar. An example of the ger-style architecture is the lamasery Dashi-Choiling in Ulaanbaatar. The
temple Lavrin (18th century) in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erdene_Zuu"] Erdene Zuu lamasery was built in the Tibetan tradition. An example of a
temple built in the Chinese tradition is the lamasery Choijing Lamiin Sume (1904), which is a museum today.
The quadratic temple Tsogchin in lamasery Gandan in Ulaanbaatar is a combination of the Mongolian and
Chinese tradition. The temple of Maitreya (disassembled in 1938) is an example of the Tibeto-Mongolian
architecture.[132] Dashi-Choiling monastery has commenced a project to restore the temple and the 25 metres
(82 ft) sculpture of Maitreya.
Music
The music of Mongolia is strongly influenced by nature, nomadism, shamanism, and also Tibetan Buddhism.
The traditional music includes a variety of instruments, famously the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morin_khuur"] morin khuur, and also the singing styles
like the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_song"] urtyn duu ("long song"), and throat-singing (khoomei). The "tsam" is danced to keep away evil spirits
and it was seen as reminiscent of shamanism.

The first rock band of Mongolia was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyol_Erdene"] Soyol Erdene, founded in the 1960s.
Their Beatles-like manner was severely criticized by the communist
censorship. It was followed by Mungunhurhree, Ineemseglel, Urgoo, etc.,
carving out the path for the genre in the harsh environment of communist
ideology. Mungunhurhree and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haranga"] Haranga were to become the pioneers in the
Mongolia's heavy rock music. Haranga approached its zenith in the late 1980s
and 1990s.
The leader of Haranga, famous guitarist Enh-Manlai, generously helped the
growth of the following generations of rockers. Among the followers of
Haranga was the band Hurd. In the early 1990s, group Har-Chono pioneered
 Mongolia's folk-rock, merging elements of the Mongolian traditional "long
song" into the genre.
By that time, the environment for development of artistic thought had become
largely liberal thanks to the new democratic society in the country. The 1990s
saw the development of rap, techno, hip-hop and also boy bands and girl
bands flourished at the turn of the millennium.
Media
Mongolian press began in 1920 with close ties to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"] Soviet Union
under the Mongolian Communist Party, with the establishment of the
Unen ("Truth") newspaper similar to the Soviet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravda"] Pravda.[134] Until
reforms in the 1990s, the government had strict control of the media
and oversaw all publishing, in which no independent media were
allowed.[134] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union"] dissolution of the Soviet Union had a significant
impact on Mongolia, where the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state"] one-party state grew into a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-party_system"] multi-party
democracy, and with that, media freedoms came to the forefront.
A new law on press freedom, drafted with help from international
NGOs on August 28, 1998 and enacted on January 1, 1999, paved the
way for media reforms.[135] The Mongolian media currently consists
of around 300 print and broadcasting outlets.[136] 
Mongolian media interviewing the
opposition [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolian_Green_Party"] Mongolian Green Party in
2008. The media has gained
significant freedoms since
democratic reforms initiated in the
1990s.
Since 2006, the media environment has been improving with the
government debating a new [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country"] Freedom of Information Act, and the removal of any affiliation of media outlets
with the government.[137][138] Market reforms have led to an annually increasing number of people working
in the media, along with students at journalism schools.[137]
In its 2013 World Press Freedom Index report, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reporters_Without_Borders"] Reporters Without Borders classified the media environment as
98th out of 179, with 1st being most free.[139] In 2016, Mongolia was ranked 60th out of 180.[140]
According to 2014 Asian Development Bank survey, 80% of Mongolians cited television as their main source
of information.[141]
Mongolian cuisine
 Mongolian cuisine predominantly consists of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product"] dairy products, meat, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_fat"] animal fats. The most common rural
dish is cooked mutton. In the city, steamed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumpling"] dumplings filled with meat—"buuz"— are popular.
The extreme [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Mongolia"] continental climate of Mongolia has influenced the traditional diet. Use of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable"] vegetables and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice"] spices
are limited. Due to geographic proximity and deep historic ties with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"] China and Russia, Mongolian cuisine is
Page 22
also influenced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_cuisine"] Chinese and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cuisine"] Russian cuisine.[142]
Sports and festivals
The main national festival is Naadam, which has been organised for
centuries and takes place over three days in the summer, consisting of
three Mongolian traditional sports, archery, cross-country horse-racing,
and wrestling, traditionally recognized as the Three Manly Games of
Naadam. In modern-day Mongolia, Naadam is held from July 11 to 13
in the honour of the anniversaries of the National Democratic
Revolution and foundation of the Great Mongol State.
Another very popular activity called Shagaa is the "flicking" of sheep
ankle bones at a target several feet away, using a flicking motion of the
finger to send the small bone flying at targets and trying to knock the
target bones off the platform. At Naadam, this contest is popular
among older Mongolians. 
Various Mongolian meat dishes
 Horse riding is especially central to Mongolian culture. The long-
distance races that are showcased during Naadam festivals are one
aspect of this, as is the popularity of trick riding. One example of trick
 riding is the legend that the Mongolian military hero Damdin
Sükhbaatar scattered coins on the ground and then picked them up
while riding a horse at full gallop.
 Mongolian wrestling is the most popular of all Mongol sports. It is the
highlight of the Three Manly Games of Naadam. Historians claim that
Mongol-style wrestling originated some seven thousand years ago.
Hundreds of wrestlers from different cities and aimags around the
country take part in the
national wrestling competition.

 Freestyle wrestling has been practised since 1958 in Mongolia.[143] Mongolian freestyle wrestlers have won
the first and the most Olympic medals of Mongolia.
 Naidangiin Tüvshinbayar won Mongolia's first ever Olympic gold medal in the men's 100-kilogram class of
judo.[144]
 Amateur boxing has been practised in Mongolia since 1948.[145] The Mongolian Olympic boxing national
team was founded in 1960. The Communist government of Mongolia banned boxing from 1964 to 1967 but
the government soon ended the ban. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing"] Professional boxing began in Mongolia in the 1990s.
 Mongolia national basketball team enjoyed some success recently, especially at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_at_the_East_Asian_Games"] East Asian Games.
