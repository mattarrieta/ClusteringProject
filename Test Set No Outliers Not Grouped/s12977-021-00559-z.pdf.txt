Abstract 
Humanized mice have become an important workhorse model for HIV research. Advances that enabled development
of a human immune system in immune deficient mouse strains have aided new basic research in HIV pathogenesis
and immune dysfunction. The small animal features facilitate development of clinical interventions that are difficult
to study in clinical cohorts, and avoid the high cost and regulatory burdens of using non-human primates. The model
also overcomes the host restriction of HIV for human immune cells which limits discovery and translational research
related to important co-infections of people living with HIV. In this review we emphasize recent advances in modeling
bacterial and viral co-infections in the setting of HIV in humanized mice, especially neurological disease, and Mycobac-
terium tuberculosis and HIV co-infections. Applications of current and future co-infection models to address important
clinical and research questions are further discussed.

Introduction
New and chronic infections with human immunodefi-
ciency virus (HIV) remain a top global health concern
40 years into the pandemic. Approximately 39 million
people are chronically infected with HIV, and 1.7 mil-
lion become newly infected each year [1]. Development
of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV
infection from a fatal disease into a medically manage-
able chronic condition. Significant progress in providing
access to HIV testing and ART has also greatly increased
global awareness of HIV status (~ 81%) and ART access
(~ 67%) in people with HIV (PWH) [1]. Access to ART
has dramatically reduced incidence of several oppor-
tunistic infections (e.g. Pneumocystis pneumonia,

Cytomegalovirus) that are important causes of death in
people with low C­ D4+T cell count due to progression to
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) [2].
Among virally suppressed patients, a variety of co-
morbidities and co-infections still produce clinically
significant morbidity and mortality. A considerable pro-
portion of the 39 million PWH, including those who are
virally suppressed on ART, still suffer from HIV-associ-
ated conditions (e.g. advanced aging, hypertension) that
can reduce lifespan and quality of life [3]. In 2019, deaths
due to HIV-related illness were estimated at 700,000 [1].
Tuberculosis (TB),  caused by infection with Mycobac-
terium tuberculosis (Mtb), is a leading cause of death in
PWH, accounting for one in three AIDS-related deaths
[4]. Sexually transmitted diseases such as Neisseria gon-
orrhoeae,  Chlamydia trachomatis, and Herpes simplex
virus 2 have a significantly higher prevalence in HIV-
infected populations [5]. Co-infection with hepatitis C
virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are emerging

as important factors contributing to increased rates and
accelerated course of hepatocellular carcinoma in PWH
[6, 7].  Development of prophylactic and therapeutic
agents for these important co-infections of PWH has
been limited due to the paucity of animal models that can
support HIV replication. Non-human primate models
that employ SIV can effectively model many important
aspects of several diseases, including Mtb. However, the
cost, regulatory issues, and length of natural infections in
these models have long presented serious challenges to
timely progress.
The human immune system (HIS) mouse is a stand-
ard system for in vivo studies of HIV resulting from
over 20 years of research in variations of the model [see
reviews [8, 9]]. The lower cost and ease of use of the
small animal along with susceptibility to infection with
human clinical isolates offer several advantages for basic
and translational research. Research in HIS mice has sig-
nificantly expanded our understanding of HIV including
pathogenesis, mucosal transmission, latency and neuro-
logical manifestations. It has also emerged as a valuable
translational platform for drug and vaccine development
[10–17]. More recently the HIS mouse has been further
adapted to facilitate study of co-infections including
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Neisseria Gonorrhoeae 
[18–20].  Recent adaptations of humanized mice that
support development of human hepatocytes, and thus
infection with HBV and HCV, are paving the way for HIS
models of HIV co-infections with hepatitis viruses [21, 
22]. Here we review how HIS models can advance our
understanding of HIV neurological disease and impor-
tant bacterial and viral co-infections. We further discuss
the potential advantages and limitations of HIS models, 
and suggest applications that could advance our general
understanding of these diseases.
Humanized mouse models of HIV and TB
The HIV and TB syndemic: need for co‑infection models
TB and HIV infections have been the leading two causes
of death due to infectious disease over many years prior
to the COVID-19 pandemic. The two infections are con-
sidered a co-pandemic due to many factors including
microbial synergy and overlapping epidemiology as we
recently reviewed [23]. TB is the number one cause of
death in people with HIV/AIDS because HIV infection: 
(1) increases susceptibility to Mtb infection and reactiva-
tion; (2) accelerates development of Mtb drug resistance; 
(3) compromises TB diagnostics; (4) is associated with
drug interactions when combining TB chemotherapy and
ART; and (5) causes an aggressive course of TB disease
[24–27]. An increased risk of TB precedes C­ D4+ T cell
depletion and can even continue following restoration of
T cells by ART (see reviews [25, 28, 29]). The basis for this 
risk in virally suppressed persons is poorly understood. 
Speculatively, these outcomes could be driven by incom-
plete suppression in tissues with poor drug penetrance or
immune disturbance due to chronic and systemic inflam-
mation. Active tuberculosis can further promote HIV
pathogenesis by increasing pulmonary virus replication, 
while latent TB is a serious risk factor for development
of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) 
when ART is initiated [30]. Treatment of co-infected per-
sons is challenging due to the aggressive course of both
individual diseases, and often is further complicated by
drug interaction and malabsorption when combining
ART and TB chemotherapy [31].
Addressing these clinical challenges of the HIV and
TB co-syndemic requires a much greater understanding
of co-infection pathophysiology. Models that permit evi-
dence-based pathogenesis studies are needed to inform
development and implementation of countermeasures to
complement ART and antimycobacterial therapies in co-
infected people. To address this gap, our research group
has developed two novel models of HIV/TB co-infection
in HIS mice. As described below, these models of active
co-infection and TB relapse offer systems to investigate
mechanisms of microbial synergy and test novel inter-
ventions to treat co-infection.
Active Mtb and HIV co‑infection in the HIS mouse
Disease models that use standard mouse strains are
indispensable in the TB research field for basic discov-
ery and development of preventives and therapeutics. 
Depletion of ­CD4+T cells in vivo can simulate the effect
of severe immune compromise, characteristic of AIDS
in murine TB models [32]. The restriction of HIV for
human host cells, however, has posed a continual chal-
lenge for development of systems to understand ­CD4+T
cell loss-independent mechanisms of dual infection. The
development of the HIS mouse as a small animal model
of TB [33] was an important step that enabled application
of humanized mice to understand co-infection. HIS mice, 
generated using the NOD SCID gamma (NSG) mouse
and the bone marrow, liver, and thymus (BLT) method, 
were shown to develop a progressive, disseminating Mtb 
infection that produced caseous granulomatous inflam-
mation consistent with human disease [33]. Lesions in
the HIS model displayed typical gross pathology of Mtb-
driven inflammation including organization of human
­CD3+T cells in the periphery of Mtb granulomas adja-
cent to human macrophages positive for acid fast bacilli
(AFB). A human cellular immune response to Mtb infec-
tion was also demonstrated in the lung and periphery of
infected HIS mice including activation of human effec-
tor cytokines (e.g. TNF-α and IFN-γ) that have defined
roles in host defense and maintenance of latency. In two

separate reports, HIS BLT mice that were infected with
Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) BCG (vaccine strain) 
also were shown to mount an adaptive human immune
response and develop lung lesions populated by human T
cells and macrophages [34, 35]. Development of necrotic
TB lesions, a hallmark of human TB pathology, is only
observed to date in BLT mice infected with Mtb, and
not BCG [33, 34]. These early studies demonstrated the
potential to simulate important features of human pul-
monary TB in a system replete with human immune cells
and thus amenable to HIV infection.
An acute HIV infection model generated with BLT HIS
mice was subsequently used as the platform to develop a
model of Mtb co-infection [19]. HIV infection was estab-
lished by intravenous injection 3 weeks prior to pulmo-
nary Mtb challenge to simulate the progression of TB in
the setting of active viral replication in a human immune
system. Outcomes in this model reproduced several
endpoints observed in co-infected persons including
increased mycobacterial proliferation, disruption of
organized granulomatous lesions including TB pneumo-
nia, and development of exacerbated pro-inflammatory
immune responses. Similar to observations in the rhe-
sus macaque model of SIV/TB co-infection [36] and lung
of a co-infected human lung specimen [19], HIV + cells
are observed localized to Mtb lesions in the lungs of HIS
mice [19]. Interestingly, the increased pro-inflammatory
lung response and localization of HIV to Mtb-driven sites
of inflammation was shown to precede the increase in
lung bacterial load.
Although further investigations are needed, these
results in an experimentally controlled setting suggest
that recruitment or proliferation of H­ IV+ cells at the
site of Mtb infection could change the local immune
response to the advantage of Mtb pathogenesis. Similarly, 
the inflammatory host response to Mtb could provide a
microenvironment advantageous for replication of HIV. 
This model sets the stage for carefully controlled experi-
ments to address these and other important questions
relevant to understanding co-infection pathophysiology.
Model of TB relapse in the setting of HIV
A majority of the 10.4 million new TB cases that occur
annually are in those who have access to TB drug ther-
apy through public health programs [37]. Clinical cure is
observed in most subjects following the standard com-
bination drug therapy. A range of incomplete cures is
also commonly observed and can include latent as well
as active infections [38–40]. Relapse of TB in those with
incomplete cures can occur immediately following treat-
ment and most often is observed within the first year
as reviewed [41]. The recurrence of TB due to relapse
is strongly associated with the HIV pandemic and plays 
an important role in the global TB burden [42, 43]. In
addition to having a greater risk for new Mtb infections, 
PWH are more likely to experience reactivation of latent
TB, have greater rates of TB chemotherapy failure, and
experience increased rates of recurrence after treatment
[25, 44, 45]. Recurrent TB is also strongly associated with
the development of multi-drug resistant (MDR)-TB or
extensively drug resistant (XDR)-TB, which represent a
global health crisis [4, 46, 47].
The immune basis for TB recurrence or relapse in those
with HIV is poorly understood and difficult to inves-
tigate in affected human populations. The loss of both
numbers and function of ­CD4+T cells is linked to latent
TB reactivation, treatment failure, or relapse upon drug
therapy completion (see reviews [48, 49]. An increased
risk for TB relapse persists in PWH despite recovery
of ­CD4+T cell numbers and viral suppression follow-
ing ART [50, 51]. The natural development of latent TB
infection (LTBI) in the absence of drug therapy occurs
in NHP and can be experimentally reactivated with sim-
ian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) [36, 52].  The basis
for SIV-mediated reactivation of LTBI has been shown
to be associated with C­ D4+T cell loss-dependent and-
independent mechanisms in different NHP species [52, 
53]. To date, an NHP model of SIV-mediated TB relapse
following drug treatment has not been described and
immune events contributing to relapse are thus even less
understood than latency reactivation.
BLT mice generated with an NSG background were
used to develop a HIS mouse model of TB relapse follow-
ing development of paucibacillary TB due to anti-myco-
bacterial drug therapy [18].  In these studies, animals
were infected with Mtb and treated with the TB drugs
rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) to reproduce a Cor-
nell-like model of latency in HIS BLT mice [18] similar
to that established in mouse strains that are not suscepti-
ble to HIV [54, 55]. Infection of HIS mice with HIV after
establishment of paucibacillary (non-culturable) Mtb 
infection with RIF/INH promoted an accelerated rate of
regrowth in lung and a site of dissemination (liver). These
results are consistent with the increased rates of TB
relapse that occur following evidence for clinical cure and
are increasingly understood to represent regrowth of the
original infectious strain of Mtb in human subjects [43, 
45].
A surprising observation in the HIS mouse model
of HIV-mediated TB relapse was that regrowth did not
appear to coincide with breakdown of contained granu-
lomas as is generally assumed to occur [56].  Instead, 
lung lesions were observed to mostly resolve following
2 months of TB chemotherapy. Following HIV infection
in mice with drug-treated TB, increased mycobacterial
regrowth was observed in lung as well as liver prior to
Page 4

redevelopment of organized granulomas. These observa-
tions should be noted cautiously pending follow up stud-
ies in advanced models such as NHP where the natural
history of disease can be followed, and granuloma devel-
opment and architecture has been more fully character-
ized. Use of mycobacterial strains carrying a molecular
barcode and advanced imaging approaches described in
NHP models [57] could be further applied to human-
ized mice to understand trafficking and redistribution
of paucibacillary Mtb following TB chemotherapy and
regrowth driven by HIV.
HIV replication was also observed to increase in lung
and liver of mice with relapsed TB as compared to mice
with HIV mono-infection. Interestingly, a marked differ-
ence was observed in these tissue compartments despite
comparable viral load in the blood [18]. RNA scope anal-
ysis further revealed the presence of viral RNA in areas
of interstitial and solid lesion inflammation due to Mtb 
including in the T cell zones of lung granulomas. The
increased viral replication correlated with increases in
several cytokines that activate the HIV LTR (e.g. IL-1β, 
TNF-α, and IL-6) due to Mtb proliferation. An interesting
hypothesis supported by these observations, is that local-
ized inflammation at sites of paucibacillary Mtb contain-
ment could promote proliferation of an HIV reservoir. In
return, or potentially simultaneously, the compromise of
local immunity by HIV may permit growth and dissemi-
nation of Mtb away from the localized site. The small ani-
mal nature of the HIS mouse is an advantage that could
be exploited to investigate these and other mechanisms
of microbial synergy. Important caveats of Cornell or
Cornell-like models that should be considered are the
requirement for drug treatment to generate paucibacil-
lary infection, and reports that suggest rates and kinetics
of reactivation can be difficult to reproduce with preci-
sion in different groups of animals [55]. The additional
variability resulting from the biological or genetic differ-
ences in hematopoietic stem cells from different human
donors used in HIS mouse generation could further con-
tribute to this challenge. Implementation of experimental
indicators (e.g. weight loss or inflammatory biomarkers) 
of disease progression, rather than time, are likely to
be important tools needed to standardize and interpret
results in these models.
Impact of co‑infections on deep tissue
compartments including reservoirs
Several lines of evidence suggest that plasma viral load, 
which is used diagnostically to assess viral suppression
status, does not always reflect replication in other tissue
sites. This question is especially relevant in the setting of
co-infections where inflammation and other factors can
promote HIV pathogenesis in local tissue sites. Notably, 
viral shedding in lung lavage of those with concurrent
Mtb has long been known to be higher than Mtb-naïve
counterparts despite comparable plasma values [58].
Similarly, HIV co-infection is associated with higher
semen, but not plasma, viral loads in men with urethri-
tis due to N. gonorrhoeae infection [59]. As previously
discussed, both of these clinical disease outcomes have
been reproduced in HIV-infected HIS mice that were
co-infected with Mtb or N. gonorrhoeae [19, 20].  We
observed similar viral load in plasma of mice infected
with the HIV-1 JR-CSF strain, while HIV copies in the
lung and liver were markedly increased in mice with Mtb.
Xu and colleagues similarly demonstrated that vaginal
shedding of HIV-1 BaL was increased in mice with N. 
gonorrhoeae co-infection, an outcome also not reflected
in the plasma [20].
An important advantage of HIS mouse models is the
potential to assess determinants of replication and res-
ervoirs in tissue compartments under experimentally
controlled settings. As shown in our on-going studies in
Fig. 1A–D, human cells that are actively replicating HIV
are found distributed throughout tissues in BLT HIS
mice including brain, lung, liver, and spleen. Replica-
tion in several tissues including colon, uterus, and vagina
have also been described [20] as well as latent infections. 
This wide distribution of ­HIV+ cells throughout human-
ized mouse tissues is an important endpoint in the model
that enable studies of tissue specific pathogenesis. This
facilitates investigation of viral replication and latent
reservoirs in difficult to assess compartment such as the
CNS, as shown with human brain (Fig. 1E, F) where HIV
RNA markings are predominantly observed in microglial
cell processes of autopsy specimens from a case of HIV
encephalitis.
HIS models should emulate the neurological picture
illustrated in human brain (Fig. 1E, F) prior to ART
administration, where RNA predominates over DNA. 
Following ART administration, greater DNA should
be observed in brain or other tissues of suppressed HIS
mice in order to emulate human disease and demon-
strate relevance to viral reservoir modeling. Modeling
of TB and HIV dual infections of the CNS are also likely
to be feasible based on our preliminary observations. As
illustrated in Fig. 1G–I, Mtb proliferation and develop-
ment of TB encephalitis are also observed in the HIS BLT
model. These features of the HIS mouse could be further
exploited to advance models of co-infection that explore
events at tissue sites that are challenging in human sub-
jects or NHP models due to experimental control, tissue
availability, or cost.
In the case of HIV and TB, reproducing co-infection in
multiple tissue sites such as the brain, lung, spleen and
liver as illustrated in Fig. 1, permit investigations that are
Page 5
Endsley   et al. Retrovirology (2021) 18:14  Page 5 of 14
not feasible otherwise. An important note in this regard
is that many of the effects of HIV are mediated by viral
proteins and pathogen recognition receptor events of
host cells (including mouse) that do not require direct
cellular infection. This advantage related to understand-
ing the indirect effects of HIV infection poses a caveat for
interpretation of some co-infection outcomes. The small
numbers of dysfunctional murine myeloid cells that per-
sist in the NSG and other background strains used for
humanized mouse generation [60],  for example, could
contribute to outcomes of Mtb infections. Murine mac-
rophages in cord blood and BLT HIS mouse models have
been shown to support mycobacteria replication [34, 35].
Comparisons of humanized and non-humanized cohorts
infected with M. bovis BCG demonstrate that reconsti-
tution with human macrophages, however, promotes
greatly increased bacterial loads [34, 35].  Importantly, 
human macrophages have been shown to predominate in
the inflammatory lesions associated with mycobacterial
antigen concentration and recruited human T cells [35].
Experimental control of the human immune cell pop-
ulations represents an important advantage of the HIS
mouse. Reconstitution of human immune populations
lacking specific compartments is emerging as an impor-
tant tool for understanding unique roles of cell types in
HIV pathogenesis. The development of the myeloid only
model (MoM) or T cell only model (ToM) demonstrated
importance of the myeloid cells in HIV persistence [61, 
62]. Surgical engraftments of human tissue explants in
NSG background mice may further allow interroga-
tion of the mechanisms contributing to in vivo disease, 
as shown to be feasible for pathogens such as Middle
Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus, Zika virus, 
and Nipahvirus [63, 64]. These approaches further per-
mit comparisons of tissue-specific disease outcomes in
the presence or absence of circulating human immune
cells [63, 64], as shown with the recent demonstration of
localized M. bovis BCG replication and development of
immune responses to cytomegalovirus infection in a lung
only model (LoM) [64]. Long term, application of these
precision models could be important for understanding
the role of specific human immune cells dysfunction due
to HIV on the outcomes of co-infections in different tis-
sue compartments.
Modeling the effects of co‑infection on ART
outcomes
Treatment of people with both HIV and other infections
can be challenging due to the complexity and sometimes
lengthy period of combination therapy. ART requires
lifelong treatment of anti-retroviral cocktails that may
require modifications when combined with other medi-
cations for non-communicable and communicable 
diseases. TB chemotherapy requires treatment with a
multi-drug regimen for 6–18 months depending on the
relative drug susceptibility or resistance of the Mtb iso-
late. The side effects, complexity, access, and cost of the
treatments can lead to compliance issues and treatment
failure [65]. Pharmaceutical improvements have greatly
reduced drug/drug interactions and toxicity issues that
previously contributed to clinical challenges. However, 
gaps remain that are difficult to address using in vitro
systems or mono-infection models. Several issues related
to “breaks” in viral suppression previously attributed
to poor compliance are understood to have a biological
component related to an underlying co-infection [66, 67].
Initial drug toxicity and drug/drug interaction evalu-
ations can be done in normal rodent models, however, 
efficacy testing is relegated to expensive non-human
primates or HIS animal models. Among these, the HIS
mouse has proven to be reliable, cost effective and repro-
ducible. An additionally important advantage of the HIS
mouse is the potential to model co-infection disease and
treatment outcomes along with drug interactions and
efficacy. In preliminary studies (Fig. 2), we have begun to
evaluate the effect of an underlying opportunistic infec-
tion on ART efficacy. In this experiment, HIS mice were
infected with HIV for several weeks and subsequently
infected with Mtb or mock-infected shortly before initia-
tion of ART. Animals were then provided a daily regimen
of combination ART to evaluate any effects of active Mtb 
infection on viral suppression. A 3 week course of ART
led to viral suppression in all Mtb-naïve mice consistent
with similar reports [68]. In contrast, circulating HIV p24
was still detectable in 3/5 Mtb-infected mice at 3 weeks
and in 1/5 mice at 5 weeks post-ART initiation. The
effects did not reach significance due to variation and
small study size. These preliminary findings could suggest
that underlying Mtb infection impacts efficacy of ART in
this model. Expanded studies with larger animal numbers
and more rigorous assessments through measurements
of time to viral suppression kinetics are needed. Long
term, HIS models may have application in the study of
OI-driven inflammation, changes in tissue pathogen dis-
tribution (e.g. reservoirs), or other mechanisms of micro-
bial synergy that may compromise ART efficacy.
Humanized mice as models of neurological disease
Models of HIV‑associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND)
Reports using HIS mice as models of neurological dis-
ease are increasing in the literature. Potential utility of
these models is greatest when attempting to emulate the
pathophysiology of neurological diseases that require
or involve the human immune system. Infection with
HIV-1, which leads to HAND, fits that paradigm well
[9, 69]. HIV-1 infection exhibits strict tropism for the

Fig. 1  HIV Infection of Multiple Tissue Compartments Supports Potential for Co-infection Investigations in HIS Mice, including in CNS. Results
shown in A–D are from mice that were infected with 2500 ­TCID50 
of HIV JR-CSF using an i.v. route and tissue collected after 3 weeks of infection. 
Autopsy specimens of human brain displaying HIV encephalitis are shown in E and F Formalin-fixed and paraffin embedded tissue sections were
cut, dewaxed, and viral RNA (A–E) or DNA (F) detected by using in situ hybridization with probes specific to the HIV-1 gag gene using RNA Scope®
or DNA Scope® (ACD Bio) (A–F). Staining was visualized with bright field microscopy. Representative images of results from mice used in various
studies is shown. Results displayed in G–I are from HIS BLT mice infected i.n. with 1­ 02 CFU of Mtb H37Rv for 4 weeks. Shown is development
of TB encephalitis as visualized with H&E (G) and pockets of AFB (H) in the inflammatory lesion. Brains of Mtb-infected mice lacking significant
neuropathology (I) also occasionally presented with a rare AFB (I). These results are illustrative of observations from several different studies
performed with humanized NSG-BLT mice with mono-infections of HIV or Mtb 
human immune system and affects central nervous sys-
tem (CNS) function adversely. HAND occurs with and
without antiretroviral therapy (ART) [70] which creates
a puzzling “gap” between the sharp lowering of virus bur-
den in blood plasma versus persistent HAND [71]. There
is an analogous “gap” between the neurovirological data
and HAND in virally suppressed patients [72]. In patients
without ART, CNS dysfunction was strongly linked to
replicating HIV and CNS inflammation (HIV encephali-
tis; HIVE) [73].
In patients given ART, HIVE and CNS viral replication
virtually disappear while HAND persists. Thus, neuro-
pathological and neurovirologic substrates of HAND
remain essentially unknown, which in turn makes it 
difficult to emulate the clinical picture in animal models. 
Attempts to reproduce HIVE pathology in HIS mouse
models are interesting, and represent an essential step
forward [72].  Disease endpoints that establish clinical
relevancy to HAND in patients taking ART remain to
be demonstrated. A critical next step is to treat the ani-
mal with ART, reverse the neuropathological features
of HIVE and then observe residual CNS dysfunction in
the animal. Achieving the key next step would emulate
the characteristic virological “gaps” that are observed in
patients treated with ART.
Some studies using HIS mice have taken steps to rep-
licate aspects of HIV infection of the CNS. The first and
most basic hurdle was to produce CNS infection with

Fig. 2  Humanized Mouse Model for Testing Drug Efficacy in Setting
of Co-infection. A Experimental design for study to test potential
for Mtb infection to alter ART efficacy in HIS mice with HIV infection. 
Humanized mice (n = 10) were infected i.v. with 2500 ­TCID50 
HIV-1
JR-CSF. At 5 weeks following HIV infection, plasma samples were
analyzed for presence of HIVp24 capsid protein. Subsequently, mice
were infected with PBS (mock, n = 5) or 1­ 02 CFU of Mtb H37Rv (n = 5) 
for another 5 wk. ART was begun in both groups 1 wk post-infection
with Mtb. B Shown is production of HIV p24 capsid protein as
detected in serum with a diagnostic ELISA at 5 wk p.i. with HIV, 
and following 3 and 5 wk of ART treatment. ART was delivered by
daily i.p. injection of Emtricitabine (140-200 mg/kg body weight),
Raltegravir (56-80 mg/kg body weight), and Tenofovir (146-208 mg/
kg body weight). The HIV p24 capsid protein was detected using a
commercially available ELISA (Zeptometrix) and results are shown
as pg/ml of plasma. Significant differences between post-infection
and post-ART treatment are indicated with *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and
***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001
HIV-1 in the HIS mouse. This has been demonstrated in
several reports that utilized a variety of HIS models [74–
79].  These models are potentially useful for studies of
virus reduction, and in some cases, to study eradication
of HIV DNA in the CNS [9]. It is difficult to determine
what experimental paradigm of viral eradication HIS
models should emulate. Specifically, the types of human
inflammatory cells in xenografted mouse models are dif-
ferent than what is found in a native human brain. Many
HIS mouse models do not replace murine astrocytes and
microglia, and these cells are important components of 
the pool of residual HIV DNA in the CNS [9]. The pro-
portionate distribution of various cells that can support
HIV-1 infection (macrophages, dendritic cells, lympho-
cytes) in humans also diverges from what is produced in
current HIS mouse models. For example, a myeloid cell
type of reservoir of HIV-1 is postulated for the human
CNS, yet many HIS mouse models involve infection of
lymphoid cell populations preferentially. To overcome
that, at least one HIS mouse model has been developed
that specifically grafts a human myeloid cell population
in the rodent [9]. That model focuses on a crucial aspect
of CNS HIV infection, that of the myeloid cell reservoir. 
Other key aspects of viral persistence, such as yolk sac
derived microglia and the role of human astrocytes, are
not addressed with this model.
The neuropathological changes observed in many HIS
mouse models are usually subdued and do not represent
the full neuropathological picture of HIV encephalitis
(HIVE). Only moderate inflammatory changes have been
produced [13, 80, 81]. By comparison, neurosurgical xen-
ograft type models of HIVE in which the brain is directly
injected with HIV-1 infected human cells (SCID mice) 
often produce more intense and “accurate” HIVE type
inflammatory changes versus what is produced in HIS
mice [79]. A key limitation in development of suitable
HIS mouse models of HAND is that the grafting does not
replace rodent microglial cells, which function as the ani-
mal’s resident histiocytic pool in the CNS. There is poten-
tial however, as effective grafting of human microglia was
recently accomplished in a humanized bone marrow chi-
mera in which human interleukin-34 under the control
of the cytomegalovirus promoter drove brain reconstitu-
tion of human stem cell derived peripheral macrophages
to differentiate into human microglial-like cells in the
mouse brain [82]. These microglial-like cells were capa-
ble of hosting in vivo infection with a myeloid trophic
viral isolate. Although not yet widely available, these HIS
mice represent a major advance, because microglial cells
are a main source of replicating HIV in the CNS and they
probably contribute HIV DNA to the latent CNS pool in
virally suppressed patients.
Engineering rodent models of CNS impairment that
faithfully emulate HIV infected patients with viral sup-
pression appears to be within sight, but many challenges
remain. Human astrocytes are infected with HIV-1 and
may contribute to the size of the latent HIV DNA pool in
the CNS. Current HIS mouse models may be less suitable
to study that aspect of HIV latency. As well, the regional
distribution of infected human cells within the CNS of
HIS mouse models might differ from the CNS of peo-
ple living with HIV infection. High levels of HIV-1 rep-
lication in the human brain tend to occur in deep brain
structures such as the basal ganglia and thalamus. The
Page 8
Endsley et al. Retrovirology (2021) 18:14  Page 8 of 14
mapping of the latent (not replicating) pool of HIV-1 also
needs to be elucidated in these models for correlation
with human CNS infection. Comparative neurovirol-
ogy between human and rodent infections is an impor-
tant aspect with implications regarding the elucidation
of circuit level changes in CNS function in patients with
HAND. Perhaps most vexing of all is that populations of
HIV infected patients harbor comorbidities with higher
prevalence than noninfected populations, particularly
including substance abuse and chronic exposure to thera-
peutic drugs with potentially adverse effects in the CNS. 
These ongoing complexities suggest that specific HIS
mouse models may be required to emulate key aspects of
human CNS infection.
Further development of HIS mouse models should take
the step forward of emulating the CNS inflammatory pic-
ture of HIVE, with CNS dysfunction when replication is
not suppressed. A key subsequent step involves treating
the HIV-infected animals with ART to prevent HIVE and
reduce the intensity of CNS dysfunction, while not elimi-
nating it, as observed in ART treated patients. Virally
suppressed HIS mice should contain a pool of latent HIV
DNA that is comparable to what is observed in human
brain specimens including its size, its responsiveness to
latency reversing agents, and its neuroanatomical distri-
bution. As well, the HIS mouse response to psychological
testing should correspond to systemic anomalies corre-
lated with HAND, such as the association with bacterial
gut translocation [83],  systemic endothelial dysfunc-
tion and systemic virology (63). Given the complexities
involved it may not be possible for a single HIS mouse
model to faithfully emulate the essential pathophysiology
of HAND.
HIV co‑infections of the CNS
Prior to the ART era, CNS forms of several infections
such as cryptococcal meningitis, cerebral toxoplasmosis, 
and tuberculous meningitis were associated with severe
clinical outcomes [84]. Neuro-TB also continues to be an
important health concern in those with HIV, especially
in children [85]. Models of neurological infection with
mycobacteria have been developed in guinea pig, rab-
bits, and standard mouse inbred strains [86]. These mod-
els have application to understanding several different
aspects of mycobacterial infection and drug penetration. 
To date, systems that permit investigations of how HIV
compromises the CNS immunity to co-infections, or how
co-infections may contribute to HAND or maintenance
of CNS reservoirs, are lacking.
Various humanized mouse models generated with
human leukocytes or stem cells have been used over the
past two decades to understand HIV infections in the
CNS [87]. To date, however, the potential to investigate 
the outcomes of co-infections has been limited by lack
of studies that demonstrate productive infections of
human cells with important co-infections such as Mtb.
Our previously unpublished work shown in Fig. 1 pro-
vides preliminary support for the potential to investigate
HIV-associated neurological Mtb outcomes. In a limited
survey to date, we have occasionally observed acid-fast
bacilli (AFB) in the brains of humanized mice after sev-
eral weeks of Mtb infection (Fig. 1I). In animals with high
bacterial burden in the lungs and sites of dissemination
(e.g. liver),  we have also observed development of TB
encephalitis (Fig. 1G) associated with areas of Mtb prolif-
eration (Fig. 1H).
The CNS is also a well-established tissue reservoir for
HIV that is poorly understood and is currently the sub-
ject of intensive investigation. A contribution of co-
infections is suspected, based on associations, although
empirical evidence is lacking. Important questions that
could be addressed experimentally in the HIS model
include: whether opportunistic infections (OI) increase
the CNS viral load or reservoir size; if systemic or tissue
compartment inflammation due to OIs promotes HIV
CNS outcomes; whether OIs contribute to HIV Associ-
ated Neurological Dysfunctions; and what are the mech-
anistic bases for increased rates or more severe CNS
outcomes of OI in those with HIV? Demonstrations that
important endpoints of CNS co-infections could be real-
ized in the HIS mouse models would also support use in
translational studies to test clinical interventions.
Humanized mouse models of HIV/Hepatitis virus
co‑infection
Due to their similar routes of transmission, it is increas-
ingly common for PWH to have a hepatitis virus co-
infection. Of the current 39 million PWH [1], 10% are
estimated to be co-infected with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) 
[88] and 4–12% co-infected with Hepatitis C Virus
(HCV) [89],  yielding anywhere from 2 to 12 million
potential co-infections worldwide.
HIV/HBV co-infection exacerbates morbidity and
mortality of both viruses, with death rates of co-infected
individuals being 8 times that of HIV infection and nearly
20 times greater than HBV infection [90]. Much of this
increased mortality springs from a five-fold greater risk
of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in HBV infected
patients with HIV [6].  Similarly, HCV-mediated liver
damage, including fibrosis [91], cirrhosis and HCC [7],
is accelerated in individuals co-infected with HIV. Inci-
dence of cirrhosis was found to be tripled in co-infected
subjects as compared to those with HCV infection alone. 
While the mechanisms of this increased pathogenesis are
not well understood, possible causes include loss of T cell
Page 9
Endsley   et al. Retrovirology (2021) 18:14  Page 9 of 14
function, increased levels of fibrosis-inducing TGFβ, and
HIV infection of hepatic stellate cells, among others [92].
Much of the difficulty of studying these co-infections
stems from the challenges to establishing animal models
of infection. The human-restricted tropism of all three
viruses has proven to be nearly insurmountable to gain-
ing insights into single or dual infections. A number of
potential models described below have been developed
in attempts to overcome this obstacle.
AFC8‑hu‑HSC/Hep model
AFC8 mice were originally created to allow for human
hepatocyte engraftment into mice to facilitate the
study of HCV pathogenesis. A fusion protein consist-
ing of KF506-binding protein (KFBP) and caspase 8 was
knocked-in to Balb/c R­ ag2−/− ­IL2Rg−/− mice under the
control of the albumin promoter, allowing for the induc-
ible destruction of mouse hepatocytes [22].  Neonatal
KFBP knock-in mice are irradiated, and human hepato-
cytes are injected into the mouse liver. Destruction of
murine hepatocytes is initiated, and dying mouse hepato-
cytes are replaced by expanding human cells. This model
was expanded into the AFC8-hu-HSC/Hep model by co-
injecting human fetal-liver derived C­  D34+ hematopoietic
stem cells (HSC) into the irradiated neonatal mouse liver
along with the human hepatocytes [93]. The engrafted
HSCs then repopulated the immune system with human
lineage lymphocytes, enabling the study of the immune
response to HCV, along with viral life cycle and patho-
genesis. This model should be capable of supporting HIV
infection, as well as hepatitis virus infection.
FNRG models
Other liver xenograft models could be similarly adapted
to HIV/hepatitis virus co-infection. The FNRG mouse is a
NOD/rag1−/−/il2rg−/− background with a mutation that
disables the fah gene, which encodes fumarylacetoacetate
hydrolase [94]. These mice also exhibit hepatocyte toxic-
ity unless fed a diet lacking tyrosine and phenylalanine, 
and supplemented with the drug nitisinone, 2-(2-nitro-
4-trifluoro-methylbenzoyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione
(NTBC). This model has also been immune reconstituted
with human leukocytes (FNRG-hu-HSC/Hep) and used
successfully to examine immune responses to hepatitis
virus infections [95, 96].
HIS/HUHEP model
A similar approach was based upon Alb-uPA/SCID
(uPA) mice. In the uPA model, the urokinase-type plas-
minogen activator was placed under the control of the
albumin promoter. The accumulation of plasminogen
activator results in mouse hepatocyte death, which are
subsequently replaced by engrafted human hepatocytes. 
Strick-Marchand et al. established a Balb/c R­ag2−/−
IL2Rγ−/− NOD.sirpa ­uPAtg/tg (BRGS-uPA) strain that
carries the same hepatocyte-lethal phenotype, but is bet-
ter able to support establishment of a human immune
system due to the expression of human SIRPα [97]. These
mice were engrafted with both human hepatocytes and
fetal-liver derived HSCs for the study of HBV infection
and the immune response.
TK‑NOG model
The TK-NOG mouse [98] a NOD/SCID/IL2Rγ-knockout
mouse which bears a thymidine kinase gene under con-
trol of an albumin promoter, also undergoes a selective
hepatocyte toxicity, accepts human hepatocytes and is
capable of reconstituting a human immune system (TK-
NOG-hu-HSC/Hep).  This model was recently adapted
to HIV infection [99] to examine the effects of HIV on
hepatocyte function. Dagur et al. reconstituted TK-NOG
mice with human hepatocytes and ­CD34+ HSCs. The
resulting mice showed functional human hepatocytes
secreting serum albumin and human ­CD45+ lymphocyte
populations consisting of ­CD4+ and ­CD8+ T cells and B
cells. These humanized liver and immune system mice
were subsequently infected them with HIV. Decreases in
CD4:CD8 ratios and serum albumin levels were detected
in at 5 weeks post-infection. This successful demonstra-
tion of HIV infection in this model makes the TK-NOG-
hu-HSC /Hep model a leading candidate for the study of
HIV/Hepatitis virus co-infection.
Hepatic replacement models overcome the challenge
of infecting mice with viruses that have a specific tro-
pism for human cells, such as HIV, HBV and HCV. While
none of the above models, to our knowledge, has yet
been used to examine HIV/HBV or HIV/HCV co-infec-
tion, they should all be suitable for that purpose. Models
that can establish a human immune system from ­CD34+
cord blood HSCs would be particularly useful, given the
regional restrictions on use of human fetal tissues. Such
HIS-huHEP mouse models would have significant advan-
tages over other potential animal models. SHIV/HCV co-
infection of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), for example, 
should be feasible, but would be prohibitively expensive
and challenging from a regulatory standpoint in many
parts of the world. HIS-huHEP mice are cheaper, more
easily housed and enjoy a far greater breadth of available
reagents. Other potential animal models lack the abil-
ity to study genuine human-infectious pathogens in the
context of a human immune response. HIS-huHEP mice
afford the opportunity to study native HIV, HBV and
HCV, in the appropriate host cells, in the context of a rel-
evant human immune response. Studies of liver fibrosis, 
immune cell dysfunction, HIV viral reservoirs and a host
Page 10

of other pathologies of co-infection are all uniquely pos-
sible in these systems.
These models may have some shortcomings, however, 
particularly with regard to vaccine testing and develop-
ment, owing to the incomplete reconstitution of the B
cell compartment in most HIS mouse models. Also of
significant concern is the matter of immune cell compat-
ibility between the tissue donors. Graft vs. host disease
is an ongoing issue in HIS mice, with the reconstituted
immune system attacking the host animal as non-self. 
HIS-huHEP mice will likely have similar issues, possibly
compounded by graft vs graft disease, with the reconsti-
tuted immune system reacting to both the host animal
and the engrafted liver if they are not sourced from the
same donor.
HIL model
More recently, a simpler model has been shown to be
useful in the study of HCV infection. In the HIL model
[100],  the injection of human fetal hepatic progeni-
tor cells into NSG mice was demonstrated to yield both
human hepatocytes and HSCs, resulting in human liver
engraftment and the establishment of a matched human
immune system. Furthermore, virus-specific lym-
phocytes and responsiveness to drug treatment were
observed.
The HIL model has significant advantages over other
HIS-huHEP models. It is much simpler to establish, as
it does not require murine hepatocyte ablation. Hepatic
progenitor cells have been shown to engraft directly into
the mouse liver [101]. It also eliminates the possibility of
graft vs graft disease, as the resultant human hepatocytes
and immune cells arise for the same progenitors. One
potential shortcoming, however, is the use of fetal tis-
sue. This will unfortunately limit the models use in areas
where use of fetal tissue is prohibited.
HLA transgenic models
Another set of models that may be useful in the study of
HIV/HBV or HIV/HCV coinfection are those that carry
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. HLA transgenic
(HLA-tg) mice were developed to study the nature of
antigen recognition by T cell receptors in the context of
HLA molecules [102], and later adapted to the study of
immunogenic epitopes of human-tropic pathogens [103].
HLA-tg mice have been produced that carry numerous
common HLA genes, including A2, A3, A11, B65, DR1, 
DR4, and DR7 families, among others, that have been
used to study the immune response to numerous viruses
including HIV, HBV, HCV, Cytomegalovirus and poxvi-
ruses [103–108].
This model was further adapted to the study of HIV by
crossing HLA-tg mice with NSG mice (described above), 
resulting in HLA-tg/NSG mice [109]. These mice could
then be reconstituted with a human immune system by
injection of ­CD34+ HSCs (HLA-tg/NSG-HIS), hopefully
overcoming the limited T cell-dependent B cell activation
and cytotoxic T cell killing often observed in reconsti-
tuted NSG mice.
The HLA-tg/NSG-HIS model could be further applied
to the study of HIV/HBV or HIV/HCV co-infection. 
Such models can be chronically infected with HIV, and
either pulsed with HLA-specific hepatitis virus antigens
or hydrodynamically injected with DNA encoding hepa-
titis virus proteins. Hydrodynamic injection is a method
in which HCV cDNA or an HBV encoding plasmid is
injected intravenously in PBS equivalent to ~ 10% of the
animals’ weight in less than 10 s [110]. This rapid infu-
sion of liquid causes body tissues, particularly the liver, 
to uptake DNA and begin expression of the encoded pro-
teins, yielding a surrogate infection in a non-permissible
tissue. While the transfected cells do not produce prog-
eny virus, they do produce all encoded viral proteins and
elicit many effects of genuine infection.
HIV-infected, viral protein producing, HLA-tg/NSG-
HIS mice could have utility in a number of areas. They
would be particularly useful in studying the immune
reaction to HBV or HCV proteins in the context of HIV
infection, as all the immune dysfunction of HIV infec-
tion would be present. Similarly, candidate hepatitis
vaccines intended for use in PWH could undergo initial
animal testing in HLA-tg/NSG-HIS mice. The effects of
HBV or HCV infection on the establishment and mainte-
nance of the latent HIV reservoir could also be examined
is this model, as transfected hepatocytes replicate most
aspects of chronic viral infection, including long-term
inflammation.
The HLA-tg/NSG-HIS model would be of more limited
utility in studying the mechanisms by which HIV infec-
tion exacerbates viral hepatitis, as this model does not
replace murine with human hepatocytes. While most
viral proteins are expressed and most aspects of infection
are reproduced, the lack of viral replication, cell-to-cell
spread and dsRNA in infected cells are formidable obsta-
cles to the study of hepatic disease. Such investigations
would be best left to the hepatic replacement models
described above.
Co‑infections of the reproductive tract
A bidirectional relationship between HIV and several
sexually transmitted infections (STI) is well estab-
lished. Beyond the common route of transmission and
overlapping epidemiological factors, HIV increases
the susceptibility to, and disease outcome of, many
STIs [5].  Similarly, several STIs including Chlamydia
trichomonas,  N. gonorrhoeae,  and Herpes simplex-2
Page 11
Endsley   et al. Retrovirology (2021) 18:14  Page 11 of 14
also increase the risk for HIV infection through reduc-
tions in barrier effectiveness, activation of HIV co-
receptors, and inflammation [5]. Clinical presentations
in PWH that have co-infection with Neisseria gonor-
rhoeae, however,  suggest microbial synergy may also
occur [59, 111]. Increased viral load in semen of those
with N.  gonorrhoeae co-infection has been demon-
strated, including after viral suppression with ART [59].
The mechanistic basis for co-infection synergy among
HIV and important STIs is poorly understood to date. 
The human tropism for both pathogens has previ-
ously limited the availability of animal models to study
co-infection.
An important advance for modeling outcomes of
HIV in the reproductive tract has been the demonstra-
tion of rectal and vaginal mucosal infections in the HIS
mouse [12, 16, 61]. These innovations facilitated devel-
opment of co-infection models for important sexually
transmitted diseases in the HIS mouse, such as the
recently described model of HIV and N. gonorrhoeae 
co-infection [20]. Xu and colleagues demonstrated that
the gut and reproductive tract of NSG mice engrafted
with ­CD34+ stem cells are well populated with human
immune cells. Importantly, human T cells including
abundant ­CD4+CCR5+ T lymphocytes that support
productive HIV replication were described. Viral shed-
ding could be easily detected in vaginal washes of mice
that had been infected with HIV by an i.p. route. Co-
infection with N. gonorrhoeae was observed to increase
the time to establishment of HIV proliferation in the
reproductive tract, and to markedly increase viral shed-
ding in vaginal washes, compared to HIS mice infected
with HIV only. The description of this small animal
model of HIV and N.  gonorrhoeae supports further
investigations of mechanisms driving microbial synergy
and provides a translational platform to test microbi-
cides and other clinical interventions. Long term, the
demonstration that the HIS mouse repopulates these
important human immune components and supports
HIV infection in the gut and reproductive tract further
supports use of the ­CD34+ cord blood models for co-
infection studies when use of the BLT mouse is limited.
Development of HIS models of HIV co-infections
with other important pathogens which are transmitted
sexually is feasible. Productive infection with herpes
simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) and development of human
immune responses to the virus was previously demon-
strated in an HIS mouse developed using cord blood
stem cells [112].  Once developed, a dual infection
model of HIV and HSV-2 would have significant util-
ity for basic discovery related to microbial synergy and
development of clinical interventions in co-infected or
at risk populations. 
Conclusions
Improvements in engraftment of human immune com-
partments in xenochimeric mice continue to support
expanded applications of these models to HIV research. 
These advances have now permitted successful explo-
ration of HIV disease in multiple compartments, 
including co-infections of the respiratory system and
reproductive tract, that reproduce important features
of the respective human disease. Recent advances in
hepatocyte regeneration have further enabled develop-
ment of hepatitis virus models in HIS mice that could
additionally support modeling of HIV co-infections
with these important causes of cancer. Many caveats to
the use of HIS mice to study HIV as well as HIV asso-
ciated co-infections remain, most notably the xenochi-
meric immunity and physiology. Care must be taken
to define the research questions as appropriate to the
model advantages and limitations. Validation of the
outcomes using human specimens and human clini-
cal research is also central to ensuring advances have
translational relevance. Long term, HIS mouse models
of HIV-associated co-infections are likely to yield key
insights into mechanisms of microbial synergies and
provide an informative and economical platform for
testing clinical interventions.
