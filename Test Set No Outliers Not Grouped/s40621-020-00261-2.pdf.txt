Abstract
Background: Research in youth sports is often complex. As interest in youth sports injury prevention grows,
scientists should consider community priorities beyond a specific research study.
Main text: This commentary discusses the authors’ personal experiences researching concussion prevention in
middle school sports, as the overarching community faced multiple challenges. These challenges included a series
of weather-related emergencies that resulted in a shift in the community’s priorities, multi-day school closures, and
cancellations of sports activities and meetings. We discuss the importance of considering community priorities and
providing support as scientists, colleagues, and members of the communities in which we conduct research.
Conclusion: Scientists should consider the changing circumstances and dynamics surrounding community
priorities in order to help drive their research-based decisions and ensure successful and respectful applications of
research based on community values and priorities.

Introduction
Research in youth sports is often complex. First, youth
are a “vulnerable” population requiring additional pro-
tections (Belmont Report 1979; U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services 2016).  Further, working
with youth involves building trust with them, their legal
guardians, and the persons/organizations with whom
youth are associated (Kerr et al. 2018).
Second, alongside surveillance efforts within middle
school, high school, and recreational league/club sport
settings, (Pierpoint et al. 2018; Kerr et al. 2016; Dompier
et al. 2015; Kerr et al. 2017) interest in applied field re-
search is growing. With such research, scientists may
lack a degree of experimental oversight (e.g., inability to
control for all extraneous variables, consistency in

exposure to intervention across/within sites).  Still, ap-
plied field research can examine phenomenon in “real
world” settings with opportunities for participants to dir-
ectly participate in intervention development (Ahmed
et al. 2018).
Finally, scientists may likely conduct research locally
within their own communities. They may be linked to
the targeted youth population as parents or coaches.
This ethical dilemma, described as “divided loyalties” by
Bell and Nutt, (Bell and Nutt 2002) can consequently
manifest negatively if scientists do not consider how to
best approach such community-based research.
Scientists must carefully consider the communities in
which they work and identify the dynamics of these
communities’  priorities. These priorities likely vary by
community, setting, and research topic, but in youth
sports may include safety, competition, skills develop-
ment, and personal development (Kerr et al. 2018). Al-
though it can be argued that scientists are trained to
innately be cognizant of culture and norms that may

influence community priorities, it is nevertheless import-
ant to have these discussions, particularly while training
the next generation of scientists.
Considering these issues in our middle school concussion
prevention research
We found that such discussions of the priorities of the
community have been important in our ongoing re-
search that examines middle school sport concussion
prevention. The study, approved by the Institutional Re-
view Board at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, aimed to develop and implement an educational
intervention to improve concussion management in
middle school sports (Kerr et al. 2018). Using a sample
of local middle schools, we conducted formative ethno-
graphic research and interviews with the middle school
sport stakeholders (e.g., parents, coaches, athletes, staff,
administrators), and provided concussion education and
prevention materials to the middle schools. Such an ap-
proach to interact with stakeholders prior to the devel-
opment and dissemination of a concussion intervention
had been previously utilized in other settings (Craig
et al. 2019).  However, the middle school sports setting
was distinct from other settings and needed a concus-
sion education and prevention framework that could suit
its unique needs (Kerr et al. 2018).  Compared to high
schools, middle schools may be less likely to have an on-
site athletic trainer or enact concussion-related policy
(Kerr et al. 2018; DePadilla et al. 2020).  As in other
emerging and under-studied settings, (Caine and Pro-
vance 2018; Emery 2018) formative research in this area
was needed to identify community priorities, as related
to the specific sports settings and overall within the mid-
dle school. We hoped that doing so would help to
recognize the requisite factors to aid the successful im-
plementation of sport-related concussion education and
prevention strategies.
During the study, the community faced multiple chal-
lenges, resulting in multi-day school closures and the
cancellations of sports activities and meetings. Weather-
related emergencies, such as hurricanes and winter
storms, caused outdoor fields to be unusable and directly
impacted sport-related events. Additional atypical events
(e.g.,  water main break) also caused further school
closures.
In the midst of these challenges, our research and
interaction with middle school sport stakeholders came
to a halt due to changing priorities. A number of com-
munity members were personally affected (e.g.,  major
damage to their homes or homes of loved ones, resultant
financial burden). Consequently, some stakeholders not-
ing that middle school sports and our concurrent re-
search and prevention efforts were understandably not a
priority at the time. Members of our research staff also 
had to contend with similar tangible damage; one staff
member’s family home was flooded and another staff
member had a tree fall through the roof of her home.
We were aware of the need to proceed in a manner that
was respectful and needed to reflect on our next steps in
how best to respect our stakeholders’ priorities.
We knew that continuing to conduct research without
acknowledging the challenges in our community would
not be responsible. Further, these affected individuals
were members from our own community and we felt
our next actions could either support or inhibit cultivat-
ing a sense of trust. There were members of the commu-
nity that were still interested in the research and wanted
to continue the process over the long-term, but under-
standably had other immediate priorities. The steps we
took in response considered feedback and input from all
levels of the study, including community members, study
staff, and our funding agency.
Although we had some ideas of what steps could be
taken to provide support (e.g., contacting and checking
in with our schools, continuing to attend practices and
games when possible even if to simply cheer on the ath-
letes), we also had to be responsive to the circumstances
as they changed and evolved. We wanted to ensure that
we were respectful and were not perceived as solely car-
ing about our own research endeavors. For those par-
ticularly affected, we aimed to provide space to allow
them to assess their options in terms of disaster-related
outcomes, such as damage to their and their loved ones’
property and mental health. This also extended to our
own staff - work schedules were modified, with substi-
tutes completing tasks as needed. In collaboration with
our research community, we worked to modify data col-
lection procedures and efforts so that they fit within the
transition periods needed as everyone returned to a
sense of normalcy. In some cases, this included not col-
lecting data at all and rather, maintaining communica-
tion with coaches and administrators. We rescheduled
meetings and were flexible as school personnel worked
with parents and athletes to resume sport activity.
Throughout this period, we kept our funding agency
abreast of the evolving circumstances and any potential
changes/deviations from the proposed protocol (e.g.,
shorter fall and winter sport season lengths than previ-
ously anticipated).  We appreciate that the funding
agency was supportive of such communication.
Conclusions
Although the challenges that the community in our re-
search study encountered were likely uncommon, dis-
cussions of community priorities are salient across all
research disciplines and among all members of the re-
search community, from the most senior research team
leader to undergraduate students in a  research

methodology course. This discussion may be most im-
perative in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The
research community has ceased all face-to-face research
and continues to debate how to proceed with future re-
search efforts.
Scientists’  reactions to communities’  changing prior-
ities can impact the development and maintenance of
trust between science and the public. Further, applied
field research can require scientists to respond to condi-
tions that fall outside of the planned study timeline or
the entire scope of the study. Such response should
emphasize flexibility to the community’s changing prior-
ities. Such changes may cause scientists to become con-
cerned about their ability to complete objectives and
milestones set forth by their funding agencies. We rec-
ommend initiating and maintaining contact with one’s
funding agency when such concerns arise, and proposing
additional measures to achieve goals despite any set-
backs. Further, it may be possible that large-scale issues
may benefit from guidance from one’s Institutional Re-
view Board. Research communities should consider their
approaches when working with their populations of
interest to help ensure successful and respectful practice
of public health and injury prevention.
