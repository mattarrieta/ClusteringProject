Characteristics and purchasing behaviours of
food-allergic consumers and those who buy food
for them in Great Britain
Stella Anne Cochrane1*, M Hazel Gowland2, David Sheffield1 and René Wilfrid Robert Crevel1
Abstract
Background: Buying behaviours of food-allergic consumers can affect the risk they incur. An online survey was
undertaken to understand the characteristics and buying behaviours of food-allergic consumers in Great Britain (GB)
and people buying food for them.
Methods: Descriptive study of food-allergic individuals in GB and their buying behaviours, based on a survey of
500 food-allergic consumers and 500 people buying for allergic individuals.
Results: Fruit and vegetables were the most commonly mentioned food allergens for adults, cows’ milk in school-age
children and eggs in younger children. 45% of respondents reported a formal diagnosis, almost half (48%) by a
specialist. Significantly (P < 0.0001) more respondents reporting severe symptoms were likely to be formally diagnosed,
but most reactions remained unreported. Nearly 2/3 of respondents always read product labels first time, however only
1/3 on every occasion. Only a third of respondents always avoided products with ‘may contain’ labels. Respondents
reporting severe symptoms, albeit still a minority, showed significantly (P = 0.0026) more cautious buying behaviours.
Conclusions: Although self-reported, the pattern of food allergy reflects other studies. A minority of food-allergic
individuals in GB, even among those reporting severe symptoms, have a formal diagnosis and most never come to the
attention of health services, suggesting that food allergies are under-estimated while more severe reactors are
over-represented in GB clinic populations. A substantial proportion of respondents regularly take risks when purchasing
food including those reporting severe reactions, confirming that current application of precautionary labelling to
mitigate and communicate risk is of limited effectiveness. Furthermore the failure of most food-allergic consumers to
read labels on every occasion highlights the importance of thinking beyond legal compliance when designing labels,
for example when adding an allergen to a product that previously did not contain it, the change should be flagged on
the front of the pack to alert allergic consumers.

Background
The prevalence of food allergy is reported to be rising in
many countries, including Great Britain (GB),  with ap-
proximately 3-4% of adults and 6-8% of children affected
[1-5] and the prevalence of self-reported food allergy is
even higher [6].
Although immunotherapy for food allergies is
progressing [7-9], there are still no widely available long-

term curative treatments available for people with food al-
lergies, and as such they must manage their condition
through careful avoidance of their trigger foods and use of
medications to treat any arising symptoms when avoid-
ance fails.
European Union legislation mandates the declaration of
14 major allergens (milk, egg, fish, crustacea, molluscs, lu-
pin, peanuts, tree nuts, cereals containing gluten, sesame,
soya, celery, mustard and sulphites) and their derivatives
(unless specifically exempted) at present when used as in-
gredients in pre-packed foods and in clear terminology

of allergens, for instance through cross-contact is less clear
and has led to widely varying practices and terminology.
As a result, confusion and issues of trust and interpret-
ation have become prominent in relation to precautionary
labels such as ‘may contain’ or ‘manufactured on a facility
that handles tree nuts’ [13-18]. As a result much effort has
been and continues to be invested in defining a risk-based
approach to the assessment and management of uninten-
tionally present allergens in foods, including their labelling
[13,14,19-21].
This situation is aggravated by the lack of specialist ad-
vice, which is often difficult for patients to access in many
countries, including GB [22-24]. Individuals therefore rely
on self-diagnosis in interpreting their symptoms and attrib-
uting them to particular culprit foods, and self-education
regarding food avoidance. This can result in serious conse-
quences relative to food choices, nutrition and the risk to
which they are exposed.
The aim of this study was to ascertain the characteris-
tics and experiences of members of the general public
who consider themselves to have food allergy and/or
who buy food for allergic individuals.
As the buying behaviour of food-allergic consumers
can affect the risk that they incur, the results of this sur-
vey can be used to improve safety for these consumers
by gaining insights into attitudes to risk and how it is
managed. 
allergy support group. Additionally no guidance was
provided to respondents regarding any of the questions
or terminology used and thus the responses given reflect
the personal understanding by the respondents of terms
such as anaphylactic shock and so forth.
As the survey was delivered by a third party, an online
market research agency, none of the authors had access
to the primary/personally identifiable data.
Results were analysed with SAS v.9.3 using the procedure
PROC FREQ. This procedure produces multi-dimensional
frequency tables for count data. Where comparisons were
undertaken a Chi Squared Test for association was used.
Results and discussion
A total of 949 respondents (537 food allergic individuals
and 501 food buyers (including 89 of the food allergic in-
dividuals)) completed the online survey. 55.32% of respon-
dents were female, 44.47% male and the population
surveyed was close to being nationally representative with
respect to age distribution (18% aged 18–29 years, 51%
aged 30–50 years and 31% aged over 50 years), regions
(23% from London, 24% the rest of southern England, 21%
Midlands and Wales, 22% the North of England and 8%
Scotland) and socio-economic groups (67% in income
bracket ABC1 (middle class) and 33% in C2DE (working
class)).
Methods
An online survey was designed with a filter question to
focus upon those people experiencing symptoms typical
of ‘true’ food allergy, and delivered with the aim of sur-
veying 500 food allergic individuals and 500 people buy-
ing for such individuals.
The filter question used was: ‘Symptoms of allergic re-
actions to foods can include mouth itching, swelling of the
lips, face, throat, mouth and/or tongue, rashes, asthma, or
even collapse and unconsciousness. These reactions almost
always happen within two hours of eating the food’. Have
you ever suffered any such reaction to any foods, or are you
the main food buyer for someone who has suffered from
such a reaction? Please tell us even if the reaction was rela-
tively mild.
The full question set covered in this publication is pro-
vided in an additional file [see Additional file 1].
The survey was not aimed at any selected population,
such as members of allergic patient groups, but delivered
with the aim of reaching a group of people as represen-
tative of the wider, general population in Great Britain
as possible. An online research agency was therefore
approached to deliver the questionnaire to an unselected
panel of respondents who had opted in to participating
in online research activities. No specific requests were
made to target specific groups such as members of an 
Food allergy demographics
When asked ‘Who in your household suffers from food al-
lergies?’  the highest incidences of food allergies were
reported in children (65%), with 34% affecting school-age
children (5–17 years) and 31% affecting younger children
(0–4 years). The remaining 35% of allergies were reported
to affect adults in the household.
For all respondents (n = 949), as shown in Figure 1, fruit
& vegetables were reported as the main cause of food al-
lergy in adults (26%), while cows’ milk was most common
in school age children (28%) and eggs in younger children
(38%).  Nearly a third of respondents (31%,  n = 295) se-
lected the ‘other’ category of food groups as responsible
for causing allergy [Additional file 1], with 41% (n = 121)
of these respondents selecting this category in addition to
one of the other eight. A wide range of food stuffs was de-
scribed with the largest group being specified fruits and
vegetables, which should have been captured under option
8 (fruit and vegetables) but were not, perhaps reflecting a
lack of understanding of where some foods are categorised
or a wish to be more specific. In the fruit and vegetable
group the largest number of responses described alliums
such as onions and garlic, followed by citrus fruits, chil-
lies/peppers, bananas and then tomatoes. After fruit and
vegetables the next largest food group described was addi-
tives (colorants, preservatives, flavourings, monosodium

(n = 23) also indicated that their trigger food had yet to be
identified and in some cases it was also conveyed that this
was a cause of distress. 
Overall the most frequently reported symptoms were
rash and itching, followed by stomach and digestive symp-
toms, then asthma and breathing difficulties (Figure 2). For
cow’s milk, eggs, fish and shellfish and fruit and vegetables,
rash and itching were the dominant symptoms. Reactions
to peanuts and other nuts were associated with rash and
facial swelling while stomach cramps and other digestive
symptoms were predominant with soy and wheat. When

member suffered? [Please tick all that apply]’, of the 16 op-
tions available, anaphylactic shock was selected by a rela-
tively high proportion of all respondents (13%) and more
so by those buying for an allergic person than allergic
people themselves (9% (50/537) versus 18% (75/412) re-
spectively) (Figure 2) (For this analysis respondents were
separated into two mutually exclusive groups: food allergic
individuals (n = 537) and food buyers only (n = 412)). Ana-
phylactic shock was most commonly selected by respon-
dents citing allergy to peanuts (28% (44/155)), other nuts
(30% (53/174)) and soy (25% (7/28)).
Diagnostic demographics
45% of all respondents reported their allergy as being
formally diagnosed, with 54% of these indicating diagno-
sis by a general practitioner and 48% by a National
Health Service (NHS) specialist. Respondents reporting 
severe symptoms were more likely to be formally diag-
nosed than those with mild symptoms, whether this
reporting was by food allergic individuals (Figure 3a) or
those buying food for such individuals (Figure 3b),  with
66% (33/50) and 77% (58/75)% of respondents (food aller-
gic individuals and buyers respectively ) citing anaphylactic
shock and 55% (99/181) and 65% (98/150) respectively of
those citing asthma or breathing difficulties as a symptom
being formally diagnosed, compared to 43.5% (134/308)
and 54% (130/240) of respondents respectively reporting
rash and itching. When the diagnostic status of those
reporting symptoms of anaphylactic shock and or asthma
or breathing difficulties (symptoms considered to be se-
vere) was compared with those respondents reporting any
other symptoms there was a significant association be-
tween severity of symptoms and formal diagnosis (P <
0.0001).We recognise that 55% of respondents report no

formal diagnosis and this therefore could mean that many
do not have IgE-mediated allergy. However whilst this ob-
servation is important, it does not detract from the results
of the survey, which reflect the characteristics and behav-
iours of people who consider themselves to have food al-
lergy based upon the general understanding of this term
and therefore act on this belief.
Buying behaviours in relation to food allergy
characteristics
Only 34% of respondents always read product labels, al-
though this increased to 64% for new products. The same
proportion (34%) always avoid products with a relevant
‘may contain’ label, while 27% buy such products if the al-
lergen is not listed as an ingredient, and 8% regularly pur-
chase such products (Figure 4).  Generally, respondents
reporting severe symptoms (asthma, breathing difficulties
and anaphylactic shock showed more cautious and vigilant
buying behaviour than those citing non-severe symptoms.
When the buying behaviours (whether or not labels are al-
ways read, only read first time or not always read) of those
reporting symptoms of anaphylactic shock and or asthma
or breathing difficulties (symptoms considered to be severe)
was compared with those respondents reporting any other
symptoms, there was a significant association between se-
verity of symptoms and more cautious buying behaviours.
Thus respondents reporting severe symptoms were signifi-
cantly more likely to always read the label (P = 0.0026). A
separate analysis of those respondents who cited anaphyl-
actic shock as a symptom revealed that only 47% (23/49)
who were food- allergic and 53% (39/73) of those buying
foods for such individuals reported that they always read
product labels and 82% (40/49) and 84% (61/73) respect-
ively read the labels of new products only (Figure 5a and b). 
Reporting reactions
Respondents were asked the following question to
understand how many reactions would come to the at-
tention of public health authorities: “When you or your
family member has a reaction to a food, which of the fol-
lowing do you do?” and given the options:
 Always report a reaction no matter how mild.
 Only report a severe reaction, even if managed
without visiting a medical practitioner.
 Never report a reaction.
The majority of respondents (52%) never reported re-
actions, with 34% reporting a reaction when severe and
only 6% always reporting a reaction.
Surveys based on self-reporting frequently over-estimate
the incidence and prevalence of food allergies, but much
depends on how the question is posed. They also have the
potential to distort the pattern, compared to the actual one
observed in the population of interest. The pattern of self-
reported food allergy among respondents in this study
closely reflects that described in the scientific literature for
Northern Europe in terms of foods implicated and distri-
bution with age, with children being primarily affected by
food allergies, egg being the most common food allergen
in young children, milk in school-age children and fruit
and vegetables in adults (with the latter possibly reflecting
cross-sensitisations with pollen allergens in this age group)
[25,26].  The pattern of symptoms reported also reflects
those in the medical literature with skin being the most
common. This suggests that the respondents are a good
representation of the food allergic consumer population in
GB. Furthermore this population is different from the usu-
ally targeted clinic or patient group populations and in-
cludes people with allergies to a range of allergens; it could

therefore be considered to be more representative of the
population at large.
As has been highlighted by the medical community in
GB [22-24] access to allergy services needs to be improved
and this is reflected in the results of this survey where a
minority report food allergy being formally diagnosed. We 
note that respondents reporting more severe symptoms
were more likely to report a food allergy as being formally
diagnosed. Nevertheless it is concerning that a large pro-
portion of respondents reporting severe symptoms such as
breathing difficulties and anaphylactic shock had not been
formally diagnosed and could be reasonably considered to

most likely not have received formal counselling regard-
ing allergen avoidance. Taken together, these findings
imply that the prevalence of food allergies in GB is most
likely under-estimated, as the majority of respondents
report no formal diagnosis, and more severe reactors
are over-represented in GB clinic populations, as might
be expected. This has potential implications for work
underway to define ‘action levels’ for the risk manage-
ment of food allergens in food manufacturing, as such
levels are based upon data derived from clinic popula-
tions. It is positive to note however that individuals with
more severe symptoms are most likely to be protected
by approaches where action levels are derived from
clinic data rather than a random population sample.
A substantial minority of respondents regularly place
themselves at risk when purchasing food products, with
only approximately a third reading product labels every
time and approximately two thirds when they buy a new
product. In addition, although those with a formal diagno-
sis were more cautious, even among respondents reporting
anaphylactic shock only approximately 50% always read la-
bels, whilst approximately 80% read the labels of new prod-
ucts. When specifically questioned about ‘may contain’
labelling consumers always avoiding products with such la-
bels were also in the minority.
Patient advocacy groups, such as the Anaphylaxis
Campaign strongly recommend to their members that
they always read the full ingredient list, as well as any
precautionary statement. The failure of most food-
allergic consumers, including those with potentially se-
vere symptoms, to read labels on every occasion high-
lights the importance of food manufacturers thinking
beyond legal compliance when designing labels to com-
municate with their allergic consumers. This finding
clearly illustrates that where an allergen is formulated
into a product that previously did not contain it, simply
adding the allergen to the ingredient list may not suffi-
ciently protect the allergic consumer. In such cases the
addition of the allergen should be flagged on the front
of the pack to alert consumers such a change e.g. using
the wording ‘New recipe’ or ‘Now Contains’ [27].
Noimark et al. (2009) reported that in a survey of par-
ents of nut allergic children attending a tertiary paediatric
allergy clinic in the UK, more than 80% would avoid a
product labelled ‘may contain nuts’ or ‘not suitable for nut
allergy sufferers’, however only approximately 60% would
not purchase a product labelled ‘may contain traces of
nuts’  [15].  These response rates were similar to a study
among a Japanese population with self-reported severe food
allergies [28] but are higher than found in this survey. How-
ever this is perhaps not unexpected given that in the case
of Noimark et al. those questioned were parents of nut al-
lergic children reaching a tertiary referral clinic and in the
case of Imamura et al.,  individuals with severe food 
allergies. Again it is noteworthy that even among the poten-
tially more aware consumers at higher risk, a substantial
minority still purchase products with a ‘may contain’ label.
Similar findings regarding food allergic-consumers’  atti-
tudes to labelling, and in some cases ignoring of labels lead-
ing to accidental exposures, have been reported in other
countries, such as Canada [16,17] and the US [18] illustrat-
ing that this behaviour is potentially global in nature. Limi-
tations and consequences of the current approach to ‘may
contain’  labelling for food allergens have been considered
by groups such as Turner et al. (2011) and are consistent
with the findings of this survey [29]. It is clear that there is
a need for agreed, accepted standards for determining when
precautionary allergen labelling should be applied and there
is a great deal of time and effort currently being invested in
addressing this challenge [19-21].
As indicated by the reported lack of formal diagnosis
and publicised issues with access to allergy services in the
UK, reaching and educating food-allergic individuals in
GB regarding any changes in food allergy labelling will be
challenging. Indeed as reported by Jones et al. (2010) ‘GPs
may benefit from education and ongoing decision support
and be supported by public education on the nature of
allergy’  [24]. Thus alternative education delivery, beyond
that via National Health Service (NHS) clinics and dieti-
cians, may prove more effective in the UK.
The large majority of respondents stated that they never
report reactions and the likelihood of reporting was asso-
ciated with symptom severity. Assessing the impact of fu-
ture changes in risk management measures can probably
not be achieved by simple monitoring, but will require
more focussed studies.
Conclusions
This study confirms that the current application of precau-
tionary labelling to mitigate and communicate the risk from
allergenic foods is of limited effectiveness and with the
reported increasing prevalence of food allergies, and until
effective treatments become available, it is important that
labelling is as robust and effective as possible, accurately
and clearly communicating risk to the allergic population.
