Abstract
Background: One of the IL-17 family members, IL-25, has been implicated with the initiation and amplification of
Th2 responses in animal models and has been associated with airway hyper-reactivity. The involvement of IL-25
and also IL-17 in food allergic disease remains to be investigated.
Findings: In this study thirty children suspected of peanut allergic disease underwent a double-blind placebo
controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) and IL-25 and IL-17 plasma levels were determined before and after challenge.
IL-25 was highly elevated only in subgroup of children with a positive DBPCFC outcome. Plasma IL-25 was absent
in children with a negative DBPCFC outcome and in healthy controls.
Conclusions: This study shows that IL-25, an IL-17 family member, is highly elevated only in children with a clinical
response to peanut. This suggests a role for IL-25 in the pathogenesis of peanut allergy and elevated plasma IL-25
may be a sign of a severe atopic phenotype.

Findings
Members of the IL-17 cytokine family are emerging as
key factors in immune responses [1].  The prototypic
family member, IL-17A, triggers pro-inflammatory im-
mune responses and contributes to neutrophilia during
chronic airway inflammation. IL-17E, also known as
IL-25, is the most divergent cytokine in the IL-17 family
and, unlike the other members, has been identified as a
central player in the initiation and amplification of Th2
responses [1]. In experimental mouse models IL-25 me-
diates early differentiation towards a Th2 phenotype and
development of airway hyper-reactivity and allergic
disease [2,3].  Moreover, allergen provocation in asth-
matic patients increases expression of IL-25 and its
receptor [4], suggesting that IL-25 is implicated in both
sensitization and memory responses in airway hypersen-
sitivity. Increased duodenal levels of Il-25 was found in
peanut allergy in a mouse study [5]. In human subjects
however, the involvement of IL-25 and IL-17 in food

(peanut) allergy remains unknown. To investigate if
there is a difference in IL-25- and IL-17 expression in
peanut allergic versus peanut tolerant (i.e. peanut sensi-
tized but, not clinical reactive) we determined IL-25 and
IL-17 plasma levels, as well as the Th2 cytokines IL-4,
IL-5 and IL-13, in a well-defined cohort of peanut sensi-
tized children undergoing a double-blind placebo con-
trolled food challenge (DBPCFC).
Thirty children suspected of peanut allergic disease
(based on either elevated specific IgE to peanut (Immu-
noCap >0.35 kU/L) or positive skin test to peanut)
were referred to The Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital,
University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands for
a DBPCFC to obtain certainty about the diagnosis of
peanut allergy (for patient characteristics see Table 1).
The study was approved by the local medical ethics re-
view boards (METC, UMC Utrecht; project no. 05/084
and METC AMC, Amsterdam; project no. 05/254) and
informed consent was obtained for all subjects. The oral
challenge was performed as previously described[6].
Peripheral blood samples were collected before the start
of the DBPCFC, as well as when the challenge was fin-
ished. Plasma cytokine levels were determined by Xmap
technology (Luminex Austin) [7].

DBPCFC resulted in a positive (allergic) and negative
(tolerant) challenge group and peanut allergy was con-
firmed in 18 out of 30 patients. In the plasma samples of
the negative and positive challenge groups we found a
striking difference for the type 2-related cytokine IL-25.
Plasma IL-25 was not detected in any of the children
with a negative challenge response, whereas plasma
IL-25 was elevated in six children of the positive
challenge group (Figure 1A). In five out of six of these
children the IL-25 concentration was even extremely
elevated, with levels ranging up to 13000 pg/ml 
(Figure 1A, B). IL-25 levels were similar in plasma sam-
ples taken after challenge (data not shown).  IL-17 was
found in both the positive and negative challenge groups
(in 67% versus 83% of children respectively), but in con-
trast to IL-25, IL-17 levels were significantly lower in the
positive challenge than in the negative challenge group
(p < 0.01) (Figure 1A, B). We show that in this cohort of
peanut sensitized children, the presence of high levels of
IL-25 in plasma is only present in children with a posi-
tive challenge and clinical reactivity is inversely corre-
lated with plasma IL-17. These findings seem to be

rather specific for the cohort of (peanut) allergic chil-
dren since both IL-25 and IL-17 plasma levels were
below the detection limit in age-matched healthy con-
trols (n = 20) (data not shown).
We searched to explain why plasma IL-25 was ele-
vated in this subgroup of peanut allergic patients. No
difference was found in relation to the other Th2
cytokines. Levels of IL-4 were below the detection
limit and IL-5 and IL-13 levels were very low when
positive. Within the clinical responder group also no
difference in peanut-specific IgE levels was found
between the IL-25 negative and IL-25 positive sub-
groups (Figure 1C).
Plasma IL-25 did not associate with total IgE levels
(Figure 1D),  previous exposure to peanut, severity of
food allergic symptoms, or the presence of asthma and
atopic dermatitis, nor did it correlate with organ specific 
symptoms during challenge (Table 1). As IL-25 is often
mentioned to be related to asthma like symptoms we
reviewed IgE data to inhalant allergens. Plasma levels of
IgE to either birch, house dust mite (hdm) and cat from
17 patients were available. In general most children with
a peanut sensitization were also sensitized to inhalation
allergens, irrespective of the positive or negative chal-
lenge or IL-25 levels .
To extend our findings in peanut allergic children we
next measured IL-17 and IL-25 in a group of infants
diagnosed with cow’s milk allergy (CMA) (confirmed by
DBPCFC, n = 12).  In these infants IL-25 was found in
42% of the allergic patients but at very low levels
(1.5-14 pg/ml) and IL-17 levels were below the detection
level (data not shown). These data indicate that elevated
IL-25 in serum is not a general phenomenon in clinical
food allergy.

Peanut allergy is considered as an indication of a broad
and possibly severe atopic phenotype and, unlike other
food allergies (such as CMA), is infrequently outgrown
[8]. The original diagnosis of peanut allergy in our tested
cohort was not based on an oral challenge and this poses
limitations on conclusions about the resolution of pea-
nut allergy. However, the data do demonstrate that
plasma IL-25 was only present in children with ongoing
peanut allergy and, importantly, despite a peanut-free
diet for at least 6 months. Together these data may indi-
cate that elevated plasma IL-25 is a sign of chronic im-
mune activation that is not induced by the provoking
allergen itself but represents a risk factor for the devel-
opment or persistence of clinical reactivity to peanut.
Recently it was suggested that IL-25 secretion is induced
during disruption of epithelial barriers. Our data are in-
sufficient to make a conclusion on the nature of a IL-25
subgroup, but it can be speculated that these patients
have a more severe type of food allergy. The finding that
only 6 out of the 18 peanut allergic patients displayed
highly elevated IL-25 levels stresses the possibility of a
clinical subgroup within the group of peanut allergic
children and warrants larger cohort studies.
IL-25 is expressed by a variety of innate immune cells
and non-hematopoietic cells including basophils, eosino-
phils, epithelial and endothelial cells [9] and in the gut
IL-25 is predominantly found in epithelial cells [10].
Innate lymphoid cells have been described in the human
that respond to IL-25 and provide an innate source of
Th2 cytokines [11,12]. Together, increased production of
IL-25 triggered by environmental antigens or microbes
in the gut might therefore contribute to the atopic
phenotype by promoting Th2 differentiation and the
maintenance of allergen specific Th2 memory cells.
In conclusion, this study is the first to show that IL-25
is highly elevated in a subgroup of peanut-allergic chil-
dren and suggests a role for IL-25 in the development
and/or persistence of peanut allergy, in this subgroup.
These findings warrant further studies in a larger cohort
of patients as well as in other food allergies.
