Calculus of variations
The calculus of variations is a field of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"] mathematical analysis that uses variations, which are small changes in functions and functionals, to find maxima and
minima of functionals: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(mathematics)"] mappings from a set of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"] functions to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"] real numbers.[a] Functionals are often expressed as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_integral"] definite integrals involving functions and their
derivatives. Functions that maximize or minimize functionals may be found using the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation"] Euler–Lagrange equation of the calculus of variations.
A simple example of such a problem is to find the curve of shortest length connecting two points. If there are no constraints, the solution is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_line"] straight line between
the points. However, if the curve is constrained to lie on a surface in space, then the solution is less obvious, and possibly many solutions may exist. Such solutions
are known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic"] geodesics. A related problem is posed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_principle"] Fermat's principle: light follows the path of shortest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_length"] optical length connecting two points, which depends
upon the material of the medium. One corresponding concept in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics"] mechanics is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_action"] principle of least/stationary action.
Many important problems involve functions of several variables. Solutions of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_value_problem"] boundary value problems for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_equation"] Laplace equation satisfy the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet%27s_principle"] Dirichlet's principle.
 Plateau's problem requires finding a surface of minimal area that spans a given contour in space: a solution can often be found by dipping a frame in a solution of
soap suds. Although such experiments are relatively easy to perform, their mathematical interpretation is far from simple: there may be more than one locally
minimizing surface, and they may have non-trivial topology.

History
The calculus of variations may be said to begin with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_minimal_resistance_problem"] Newton's minimal resistance problem in 1687, followed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brachistochrone_curve"] brachistochrone curve problem raised by
 Johann Bernoulli (1696).[2] It immediately occupied the attention of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Bernoulli"] Jakob Bernoulli and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_de_l%27H%C3%B4pital"] Marquis de l'Hôpital, but [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler"] Leonhard Euler first elaborated the subject,
beginning in 1733. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Louis_Lagrange"] Lagrange was influenced by Euler's work to contribute significantly to the theory. After Euler saw the 1755 work of the 19-year-old Lagrange,
Euler dropped his own partly geometric approach in favor of Lagrange's purely analytic approach and renamed the subject the calculus of variations in his 1756
lecture  Elementa  Calculi

 Legendre (1786) laid down a method, not entirely satisfactory, for the discrimination of maxima and minima. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton"] Isaac Newton and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Leibniz"] Gottfried Leibniz also gave some
early attention to the subject.[5] To this discrimination [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenzo_Brunacci"] Vincenzo Brunacci (1810), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss"] Carl Friedrich Gauss (1829), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%A9on_Poisson"] Siméon Poisson (1831), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Ostrogradsky"] Mikhail Ostrogradsky
(1834), and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Gustav_Jakob_Jacobi"] Carl Jacobi (1837) have been among the contributors. An important general work is that of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Sarrus"] Sarrus (1842) which was condensed and improved by
 Cauchy (1844). Other valuable treatises and memoirs have been written by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauch"] Strauch (1849), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hewitt_Jellett"] Jellett (1850), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Hesse"] Otto Hesse (1857), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Clebsch"] Alfred Clebsch (1858), and Lewis
Buffett Carll (1885), but perhaps the most important work of the century is that of Weierstrass. His celebrated course on the theory is epoch-making, and it may be
asserted that he was the first to place it on a firm and unquestionable foundation. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_twentieth_problem"] 20th and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_twenty-third_problem"] 23rd [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_problems"] Hilbert problem published in 1900 encouraged further
development.[5]

alternative to the calculus of variations.[7][8][9][b]
Extrema
The calculus of variations is concerned with the maxima or minima (collectively called extrema) of functionals. A functional maps [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"] functions to scalars, so
functionals have been described as "functions of functions." Functionals have extrema with respect to the elements of a given [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space"] function space defined over a
given domain. A functional is said to have an extremum at the function if  has the same [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_(mathematics)"] sign for all in an arbitrarily small
neighborhood of [c] The function is called an extremal function or extremal.[d] The extremum is called a local maximum if  everywhere in an
arbitrarily small neighborhood of and a local minimum if  there. For a function space of continuous functions, extrema of corresponding functionals are
called strong extrema or weak extrema, depending on whether the first derivatives of the continuous functions are respectively all continuous or not.[11]
Both strong and weak extrema of functionals are for a space of continuous functions but strong extrema have the additional requirement that the first derivatives of
the functions in the space be continuous. Thus a strong extremum is also a weak extremum, but the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Converse_(logic)"] converse may not hold. Finding strong extrema is more
difficult than finding weak extrema.[12] An example of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessity_and_sufficiency"] necessary condition that is used for finding weak extrema is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation"] Euler–Lagrange equation.[13][e]
Euler–Lagrange equation
Finding the extrema of functionals is similar to finding the maxima and minima of functions. The maxima and minima of a function may be located by finding the
points where its derivative vanishes (i.e., is equal to zero). The extrema of functionals may be obtained by finding functions for which the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_derivative"] functional derivative is
equal to zero. This leads to solving the associated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation"] Euler–Lagrange equation.[f]
Consider the functional

In general this gives a second-order [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation"] ordinary differential equation which can be solved to obtain the extremal function The Euler–Lagrange equation is a
necessary, but not sufficient, condition for an extremum A sufficient condition for a minimum is given in the section Variations and sufficient condition for a
minimum.

In order to illustrate this process, consider the problem of finding the extremal function

purposes.

so that is a minimum. The equation for a straight line is  In
Beltrami's identity
In physics problems it may be the case that  meaning the integrand is a function of
Euler–Lagrange equation can be simplified to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltrami_identity"] Beltrami identity[16] 
and  but does not appear separately. In that case, the
where is a constant. The left hand side is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_transformation"] Legendre transformation of with respect to
 The intuition behind this result is that, if the variable is actually time, then the statement implies that the Lagrangian is time-independent. By Noether's
theorem, there is an associated conserved quantity. In this case, this quantity is the Hamiltonian, the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian, which (often) coincides
with the energy of the system. This is (minus) the constant in Beltrami's identity.
Euler–Poisson equation
If depends on higher-derivatives of  that is, if
then must satisfy the Euler–[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sim%C3%A9on_Denis_Poisson"] Poisson equation,[17]
Du Bois-Reymond's theorem
The discussion thus far has assumed that extremal functions possess two continuous derivatives, although the existence of the integral requires only first
derivatives of trial functions. The condition that the first variation vanishes at an extremal may be regarded as a weak form of the Euler–Lagrange equation. The
theorem of Du Bois-Reymond asserts that this weak form implies the strong form. If  has continuous first and second derivatives with respect to all of its
arguments, and if
then has two continuous derivatives, and it satisfies the Euler–Lagrange equation.
Lavrentiev phenomenon
Hilbert was the first to give good conditions for the Euler–Lagrange equations to give a stationary solution. Within a convex area and a positive thrice
differentiable Lagrangian the solutions are composed of a countable collection of sections that either go along the boundary or satisfy the Euler–Lagrange
equations in the interior.
However [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Lavrentyev"] Lavrentiev in 1926 showed that there are circumstances where there is no optimum solution but one can be approached arbitrarily closely by increasing
numbers of sections. The Lavrentiev Phenomenon identifies a difference in the infimum of a minimization problem across different classes of admissible functions.
For instance the following problem, presented by Manià in 1934:[18]
Page 5
Clearly, minimizes the functional, but we find any function gives a value bounded away from the infimum.
Examples (in one-dimension) are traditionally manifested across and  but Ball and Mizel[19] procured the first functional that displayed Lavrentiev's
Phenomenon across and for  There are several results that gives criteria under which the phenomenon does not occur - for instance
'standard growth', a Lagrangian with no dependence on the second variable, or an approximating sequence satisfying Cesari's Condition (D) - but results are often
particular, and applicable to a small class of functionals.
Connected with the Lavrentiev Phenomenon is the repulsion property: any functional displaying Lavrentiev's Phenomenon will display the weak repulsion
property.[20]
Functions of several variables
For example, if  denotes the displacement of a membrane above the domain in the plane, then its potential energy is proportional to its surface area:
 Plateau's problem consists of finding a function that minimizes the surface area while assuming prescribed values on the boundary of ; the solutions are called
minimal surfaces. The Euler–Lagrange equation for this problem is nonlinear:
See Courant (1950) for details.
Dirichlet's principle
It is often sufficient to consider only small displacements of the membrane, whose energy difference from no displacement is approximated by
The functional is to be minimized among all trial functions that assume prescribed values on the boundary of If is the minimizing function and is an
arbitrary smooth function that vanishes on the boundary of then the first variation of  must vanish:

in
The difficulty with this reasoning is the assumption that the minimizing function u must have two derivatives. Riemann argued that the existence of a smooth
minimizing function was assured by the connection with the physical problem: membranes do indeed assume configurations with minimal potential energy.
Riemann named this idea the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_principle"] Dirichlet principle in honor of his teacher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gustav_Lejeune_Dirichlet"] Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. However Weierstrass gave an example of a variational
problem with no solution: minimize
among all functions that satisfy  and    can be made arbitrarily small by choosing piecewise linear functions that make a transition
between −1 and 1 in a small neighborhood of the origin. However, there is no function that makes [j] Eventually it was shown that Dirichlet's principle is
valid, but it requires a sophisticated application of the regularity theory for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_partial_differential_equation"] elliptic partial differential equations; see Jost and Li–Jost (1998).
Generalization to other boundary value problems
A more general expression for the potential energy of a membrane is
Page 6
This corresponds to an external force density in  an external force on the boundary and elastic forces with modulus acting on The
function that minimizes the potential energy with no restriction on its boundary values will be denoted by Provided that and are continuous, regularity
theory implies that the minimizing function will have two derivatives. In taking the first variation, no boundary condition need be imposed on the increment
The first variation of  is given by
If we apply the divergence theorem, the result is
If we first set  on the boundary integral vanishes, and we conclude as before that
in  Then if we allow to assume arbitrary boundary values, this implies that must satisfy the boundary condition
on This boundary condition is a consequence of the minimizing property of : it is not imposed beforehand. Such conditions are called natural boundary
conditions.
The preceding reasoning is not valid if vanishes identically on In such a case, we could allow a trial function

where is a constant. For such a trial
By appropriate choice of  can assume any value unless the quantity inside the brackets vanishes. Therefore, the variational problem is meaningless unless
This condition implies that net external forces on the system are in equilibrium. If these forces are in equilibrium, then the variational problem has a solution, but it
is not unique, since an arbitrary constant may be added. Further details and examples are in Courant and Hilbert (1953).
Eigenvalue problems
Both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional eigenvalue problems can be formulated as variational problems.
Sturm–Liouville problems
The Sturm–Liouville eigenvalue problem involves a general quadratic form
where is restricted to functions that satisfy the boundary conditions
Let be a normalization integral
The functions and are required to be everywhere positive and bounded away from zero. The primary variational problem is to minimize the ratio
among all satisfying the endpoint conditions. It is shown below that the Euler–Lagrange equation for the minimizing is
where is the quotient
It can be shown (see Gelfand and Fomin 1963) that the minimizing has two derivatives and satisfies the Euler–Lagrange equation. The associated will be
denoted by ; it is the lowest eigenvalue for this equation and boundary conditions. The associated minimizing function will be denoted by  This
variational characterization of eigenvalues leads to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Ritz_method"] Rayleigh–Ritz method: choose an approximating as a linear combination of basis functions (for example
trigonometric functions) and carry out a finite-dimensional minimization among such linear combinations. This method is often surprisingly accurate.
The next smallest eigenvalue and eigenfunction can be obtained by minimizing under the additional constraint
This procedure can be extended to obtain the complete sequence of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for the problem.
Page 7
The variational problem also applies to more general boundary conditions. Instead of requiring that vanish at the endpoints, we may not impose any condition at
the endpoints, and set
where and are arbitrary. If we set  the first variation for the ratio is
where λ is given by the ratio  as previously.After integration by parts,
If we first require that vanish at the endpoints, the first variation will vanish for all such only if
If satisfies this condition, then the first variation will vanish for arbitrary only if
These latter conditions are the natural boundary conditions for this problem, since they are not imposed on trial functions for the minimization, but are instead a
consequence of the minimization.
Eigenvalue problems in several dimensions
Eigenvalue problems in higher dimensions are defined in analogy with the one-dimensional case. For example, given a domain with boundary in three
dimensions we may define
and
Let be the function that minimizes the quotient
where 
with no condition prescribed on the boundary The Euler–Lagrange equation satisfied by is
The minimizing must also satisfy the natural boundary condition
on the boundary This result depends upon the regularity theory for elliptic partial differential equations; see Jost and Li–Jost (1998) for details. Many
extensions, including completeness results, asymptotic properties of the eigenvalues and results concerning the nodes of the eigenfunctions are in Courant and
Hilbert (1953).
Applications
Optics
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_principle"] Fermat's principle states that light takes a path that (locally) minimizes the optical length between its endpoints. If the -coordinate is chosen as the parameter along
the path, and  along the path, then the optical length is given by

The light rays may be determined by integrating this equation. This formalism is used in the context of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_optics"] Lagrangian optics and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_optics"] Hamiltonian optics.
Snell's law
There is a discontinuity of the refractive index when light enters or leaves a lens. Let
where and are constants. Then the Euler–Lagrange equation holds as before in the region where or  and in fact the path is a straight line
there, since the refractive index is constant. At the  must be continuous, but may be discontinuous. After integration by parts in the separate regions
and using the Euler–Lagrange equations, the first variation takes the form
The factor multiplying is the sine of angle of the incident ray with the axis, and the factor multiplying is the sine of angle of the refracted ray with the
axis. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snell%27s_law"] Snell's law for refraction requires that these terms be equal. As this calculation demonstrates, Snell's law is equivalent to vanishing of the first variation of
the optical path length.
Fermat's principle in three dimensions
It is expedient to use vector notation: let

let be a parameter, let  be the parametric representation of a curve and let  be its
Note that this integral is invariant with respect to changes in the parametric representation of  The Euler–Lagrange equations for a minimizing curve have the
symmetric form
where
It follows from the definition that satisfies
Therefore, the integral may also be written as
This form suggests that if we can find a function whose gradient is given by then the integral is given by the difference of at the endpoints of the interval
of integration. Thus the problem of studying the curves that make the integral stationary can be related to the study of the level surfaces of In order to find such a
function, we turn to the wave equation, which governs the propagation of light. This formalism is used in the context of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_optics"] Lagrangian optics and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamiltonian_optics"] Hamiltonian optics.
Connection with the wave equation
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation"] wave equation for an inhomogeneous medium is
where is the velocity, which generally depends upon Wave fronts for light are characteristic surfaces for this partial differential equation: they satisfy
Page 9
We may look for solutions in the form
In that case, satisfies
where According to the theory of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_partial_differential_equation"] first-order partial differential equations, if
along a system of curves (the light rays) that are given by 
then satisfies
These equations for solution of a first-order partial differential equation are identical to the Euler–Lagrange equations if we make the identification
We conclude that the function is the value of the minimizing integral as a function of the upper end point. That is, when a family of minimizing curves is
constructed, the values of the optical length satisfy the characteristic equation corresponding the wave equation. Hence, solving the associated partial differential
equation of first order is equivalent to finding families of solutions of the variational problem. This is the essential content of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Jacobi_theory"] Hamilton–Jacobi theory, which
applies to more general variational problems.
Mechanics
In classical mechanics, the action, is defined as the time integral of the Lagrangian, The Lagrangian is the difference of energies,
where is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy"] kinetic energy of a mechanical system and its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy"] potential energy. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%27s_principle"] Hamilton's principle (or the action principle) states that the motion of a
conservative holonomic (integrable constraints) mechanical system is such that the action integral
is stationary with respect to variations in the path The Euler–Lagrange equations for this system are known as Lagrange's equations:
and they are equivalent to Newton's equations of motion (for such systems).
The conjugate momenta are defined by
For example, if
then
 Hamiltonian mechanics results if the conjugate momenta are introduced in place of by a Legendre transformation of the Lagrangian into the Hamiltonian
defined by
The Hamiltonian is the total energy of the system: Analogy with Fermat's principle suggests that solutions of Lagrange's equations (the particle
trajectories) may be described in terms of level surfaces of some function of  This function is a solution of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton%E2%80%93Jacobi_equation"] Hamilton–Jacobi equation:

Variations and sufficient condition for a minimum
Calculus of variations is concerned with variations of functionals, which are small changes in the functional's value due to small changes in the function that is its
argument. The first variation[k] is defined as the linear part of the change in the functional, and the second variation[l] is defined as the quadratic part.[22]
For example, if  is a functional with the function as its argument, and there is a small change in its argument from to
function in the same function space as then the corresponding change in the functional is[m] 
where is a
The functional is said to be differentiable if

variation of  and is denoted by,[28] 
is a quadratic functional,[p] and  as  The quadratic functional is the second
The second variation is said to be strongly positive if
for all and for some constant .[29]
Using the above definitions, especially the definitions of first variation, second variation, and strongly positive, the following sufficient condition for a minimum of
a functional can be stated.
Sufficient condition for a minimum:
The functional

has a minimum at  if its first variation at  and its second variation is strongly positive at  [30]

a. Whereas [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus"] elementary calculus is about [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal"] infinitesimally small changes in the values of functions without changes in the function itself, calculus
of variations is about infinitesimally small changes in the function itself, which are called variations.[1]
b. See [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_J._Kushner"] Harold J. Kushner (2004): regarding Dynamic Programming, "The calculus of variations had related ideas (e.g., the work of
Caratheodory, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation). This led to conflicts with the calculus of variations community."
c. The neighborhood of is the part of the given function space where
number that specifies the size of the neighborhood.[10] 
over the whole domain of the functions, with a positive
d. Note the difference between the terms extremal and extremum. An extremal is a function that makes a functional an extremum.
e. For a sufficient condition, see section Variations and sufficient condition for a minimum.
f. The following derivation of the Euler–Lagrange equation corresponds to the derivation on pp. 184–185 of Courant & Hilbert (1953).[14]
g. Note that and
constraints. 
are evaluated at the same values of which is not valid more generally in variational calculus with non-holonomic
h. The product is called the first variation of the functional and is denoted by Some references define the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_variation"] first variation differently by
leaving out the factor.
i. As a historical note, this is an axiom of Archimedes. See e.g. Kelland (1843).[15]
j. The resulting controversy over the validity of Dirichlet's principle is explained by Turnbull.[21]
k. The first variation is also called the variation, differential, or first differential.
l. The second variation is also called the second differential.
m. Note that and the variations below, depend on both and The argument has been left out to simplify the notation. For example, 
could have been written [23]
n. A functional is said to be linear if    and    where are functions and is a real number.[24]
o. For a function that is defined for
[25] 
where and are real numbers, the norm of is its maximum absolute value, i.e. 
p. A functional is said to be quadratic if it is a bilinear functional with two argument functions that are equal. A bilinear functional is a functional
that depends on two argument functions and is linear when each argument function in turn is fixed while the other argument function is
variable.[27]
q. For other sufficient conditions, see in Gelfand & Fomin 2000,
Chapter 5: "The Second Variation. Sufficient Conditions for a Weak Extremum" – Sufficient conditions for a weak minimum are given
by the theorem on p. 116.
Chapter 6: "Fields. Sufficient Conditions for a Strong Extremum" – Sufficient conditions for a strong minimum are given by the
theorem on p. 148.
r. One may note the similarity to the sufficient condition for a minimum of a function, where the first derivative is zero and the second derivative is
positive.
