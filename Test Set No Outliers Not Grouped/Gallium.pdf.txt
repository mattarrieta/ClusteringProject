Gallium
Gallium is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"] chemical element with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_(chemistry)"] symbol
Ga and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number"] atomic number 31. Discovered by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"] French
 chemist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul-%C3%89mile_Lecoq_de_Boisbaudran"] Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in
1875,[6] Gallium is in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_group"] group 13 of the periodic
table and is similar to the other metals of the
group (aluminium, indium, and thallium).

Elemental gallium is a soft, silvery [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"] metal in
 standard temperature and pressure. In its liquid
state, it becomes silvery white. If too much force
is applied, the gallium may fracture conchoidally.
Since its discovery in 1875, gallium has widely
been used to make [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy"] alloys with low melting
points. It is also used in semiconductors, as a
 dopant in semiconductor substrates.
The melting point of gallium is used as a
temperature reference point. Gallium alloys are
used in thermometers as a non-toxic and
 environmentally friendly alternative to mercury,
and can withstand higher temperatures than
mercury. An even lower melting point of −19 °C
(−2 °F), well below the freezing point of water, is
claimed for the alloy [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galinstan"] galinstan (62–⁠95% gallium,
5–⁠22% indium, and 0–⁠16% [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin"] tin by weight), but
that may be the freezing point with the effect of
supercooling.
Gallium does not occur as a free element in
nature, but as gallium(III) compounds in trace
amounts in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"] zinc ores (such as sphalerite) and in
bauxite. Elemental gallium is a  liquid at
temperatures greater than 29.76 °C (85.57 °F),
and will melt in a person's hands at normal
human body temperature of 37.0 °C (98.6 °F).
Gallium is predominantly used in electronics.
 Gallium arsenide, the primary chemical
compound of gallium in electronics, is used in
 microwave circuits, high-speed switching circuits,
 and infrared circuits. Semiconducting gallium
nitride and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indium_gallium_nitride"] indium gallium nitride produce blue
 and violet light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and diode
lasers. Gallium is also used in the production of
artificial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadolinium_gallium_garnet"] gadolinium gallium garnet for jewelry.

Elemental gallium is not found in nature, but it is
easily obtained by smelting. Very pure gallium is
a silvery blue metal that fractures [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conchoidal_fracture"] conchoidally

The melting point of gallium allows it to melt in the human hand, and then solidify if removed. The liquid
metal has a strong tendency to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercooling"] supercool below its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point"] melting point/[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing_point"] freezing point: Ga nanoparticles can be
kept in the liquid state below 90 K.[16] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_crystal"] Seeding with a crystal helps to initiate freezing. Gallium is one of
the four non-radioactive metals (with caesium, rubidium, and mercury) that are known to be liquid at, or
near, normal room temperature. Of the four, gallium is the only one that is neither highly reactive (as are
rubidium and caesium) nor highly toxic (as is mercury) and can, therefore, be used in metal-in-glass high-
temperature thermometers. It is also notable for having one of the largest liquid ranges for a metal, and for
having (unlike mercury) a low [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressure"] vapor pressure at high temperatures. Gallium's boiling point, 2673  K, is
more than eight times higher than its melting point on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_scale"] absolute scale, the greatest ratio between melting
point and boiling point of any element.[17] Unlike mercury, liquid gallium metal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetting"] wets glass and skin, along
with most other materials (with the exceptions of quartz, graphite, and Teflon), making it mechanically
more difficult to handle even though it is substantially less toxic and requires far fewer precautions. Gallium
painted onto glass is a brilliant mirror.[18] For this reason as well as the metal contamination and freezing-
expansion problems, samples of gallium metal are usually supplied in polyethylene packets within other
containers.

Gallium does not [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal"] crystallize in any of the simple [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure"] crystal structures.
The stable phase under normal conditions is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthorhombic"] orthorhombic with 8
atoms in the conventional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_cell"] unit cell. Within a unit cell, each atom
has only one nearest neighbor (at a distance of 244 pm).  The
remaining six unit cell neighbors are spaced 27, 30 and 39 pm
farther away, and they are grouped in pairs with the same
distance.[20] Many stable and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability_in_molecules"] metastable phases are found as

Ga2 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimer_(chemistry)"] dimers are seen as the fundamental building blocks of the
crystal. This explains the low melting point relative to the neighbor
elements, aluminium and indium. This structure is strikingly similar
to that of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodine"] iodine and may form because of interactions between the single 4p electrons of gallium atoms,
further away from the nucleus than the 4s electrons and the [Ar]3d10 core. This phenomenon recurs with
 mercury with its "pseudo-noble-gas" [Xe]4f145d106s2 electron configuration, which is liquid at room
temperature.[22] The 3d10 electrons do not shield the outer electrons very well from the nucleus and hence
the first ionisation energy of gallium is greater than that of aluminium.[9] Ga2 dimers do not persist in the
liquid state and liquid gallium exhibits a complex low-coordinated structure in which each gallium atom is
surrounded by 10 others, compared to values of 11-12 typical of most liquid metals.[23][24]
The physical properties of gallium are highly anisotropic, i.e. have different values along the three major
crystallographical axes a, b, and c (see table), producing a significant difference between the linear (α) and
volume [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_expansion"] thermal expansion coefficients. The properties of gallium are strongly temperature-dependent,
particularly near the melting point. For example, the coefficient of thermal expansion increases by several
hundred percents upon melting.[19]
Isotopes
Gallium has 31 known isotopes, ranging in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_number"] mass number from 56 to 86. Only two isotopes are stable and
occur naturally, gallium-69 and gallium-71. Gallium-69 is more abundant: it makes up about 60.1% of
natural gallium, while gallium-71 makes up the remaining 39.9%. All the other isotopes are radioactive,
with gallium-67 being the longest-lived (half-life 3.261  days). Isotopes lighter than gallium-69 usually
decay through [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_plus_decay"] beta plus decay (positron emission) or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_capture"] electron capture to isotopes of zinc, although the
lightest few (with mass numbers 56 through 59) decay through prompt [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_emission"] proton emission. Isotopes heavier
 than gallium-71 decay through beta minus decay (electron emission),  possibly with delayed neutron
emission, to isotopes of germanium, while gallium-70 can decay through both beta minus decay and
electron capture. Gallium-67 is unique among the light isotopes in having only electron capture as a decay
mode, as its decay energy is not sufficient to allow positron emission.[25] Gallium-67 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium-68"] gallium-68 (half-
life 67.7 min) are both used in nuclear medicine.
Chemical properties
Gallium is found primarily in the +3 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidation_state"] oxidation state. The +1 oxidation state is also found in some
compounds, although it is less common than it is for gallium's heavier congeners [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indium"] indium and thallium. For
example, the very stable GaCl2 contains both gallium(I) and gallium(III) and can be formulated as
GaIGaIIICl4; in contrast, the monochloride is unstable above 0 °C, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disproportionating"] disproportionating into elemental
gallium and gallium(III) chloride. Compounds containing Ga–Ga bonds are true gallium(II) compounds,
such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium(II)_sulfide"] GaS (which can be formulated as Ga24+(S2−)2) and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioxan"] dioxan complex Ga2Cl4(C4H8O2)2.[26]

Gallane is unstable above −10 °C, decomposing to elemental gallium and hydrogen.[37]
Organogallium compounds
Organogallium compounds are of similar reactivity to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organoindium_chemistry"] organoindium compounds, less reactive than
 organoaluminium compounds, but more reactive than [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallium#Organothallium_compounds"] organothallium compounds.[38] Alkylgalliums are
monomeric. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_acid"] Lewis acidity decreases in the order Al > Ga > In and as a result organogallium compounds do
not form bridged dimers as organoaluminium compounds do. Organogallium compounds are also less
reactive than organoaluminium compounds. They do form stable peroxides.[39] These alkylgalliums are
liquids at room temperature, having low melting points, and are quite mobile and flammable.
Triphenylgallium is monomeric in solution, but its crystals form chain structures due to weak intermolecluar
Ga···C interactions.[38]
Gallium trichloride is a common starting reagent for the formation of organogallium compounds, such as in
 carbogallation reactions.[40] Gallium trichloride reacts with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium"] lithium cyclopentadienide in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethyl_ether"] diethyl ether to
form the trigonal planar gallium cyclopentadienyl complex GaCp3. Gallium(I) forms complexes with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arene"] arene
ligands such as hexamethylbenzene. Because this ligand is quite bulky, the structure of the [Ga(η6-
C6Me6)]+ is that of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_sandwich_compound"] half-sandwich. Less bulky ligands such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesitylene"] mesitylene allow two ligands to be
attached to the central gallium atom in a bent sandwich structure. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzene"] Benzene is even less bulky and allows the
formation of dimers: an example is [Ga(η6-C6H6)2] [GaCl4]·3C6H6.[38]
History
In 1871, the existence of gallium was first predicted by Russian
chemist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitri_Mendeleev"] Dmitri Mendeleev, who named it "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendeleev%27s_predicted_elements"] eka-aluminium" from its
position in his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table"] periodic table. He also predicted several properties of
eka-aluminium that correspond closely to the real properties of
gallium, such as its density, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point"] melting point, oxide character, and
bonding in chloride.[41]

Mendeleev further predicted that eka-aluminium would be discovered by means of the spectroscope, and
that metallic eka-aluminium would dissolve slowly in both acids and alkalis and would not react with air.
He also predicted that M2O3 would dissolve in acids to give MX3 salts, that eka-aluminium salts would
form basic salts, that eka-aluminium sulfate should form alums, and that anhydrous MCl3 should have a
greater volatility than ZnCl2: all of these predictions turned out to be true.[42]
Gallium was discovered using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy"] spectroscopy by French chemist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Emile_Lecoq_de_Boisbaudran"] Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran in 1875
from its characteristic spectrum (two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violet_(color)"] violet lines) in a sample of sphalerite.[43] Later that year, Lecoq
obtained the free metal by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis"] electrolysis of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxide"] hydroxide in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_hydroxide"] potassium hydroxide solution.[44]
He named the element "gallia", from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"] Latin Gallia meaning Gaul, after his native land of France. It was later
claimed that, in a multilingual [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun"] pun of a kind favoured by men of science in the 19th century, he had also
named gallium after himself: "Le coq" is French for "the rooster" and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"] Latin word for "rooster" is
"gallus". In an 1877 article, Lecoq denied this conjecture.[44]
Originally, de Boisbaudran determined the density of gallium as 4.7 g/cm3, the only property that failed to
match Mendeleev's predictions; Mendeleev then wrote to him and suggested that he should remeasure the
density, and de Boisbaudran then obtained the correct value of 5.9 g/cm3, that Mendeleev had predicted
exactly.[42]
From its discovery in 1875 until the era of semiconductors, the primary uses of gallium were high-
temperature thermometrics and metal alloys with unusual properties of stability or ease of melting (some
such being liquid at room temperature).
The development of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium_arsenide"] gallium arsenide as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_and_indirect_band_gaps"] direct bandgap semiconductor in the 1960s ushered in the most
important stage in the applications of gallium.[18] In 1978, the electronics industry used gallium to fabricate
light emitting diodes, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics"] photovoltaics and semiconductors, while the metals business used it[45] to reduce the
melting point of alloys.[46]
Occurrence
Gallium does not exist as a free element in the Earth's crust, and the few high-content minerals, such as
gallite (CuGaS2), are too rare to serve as a primary source.[47] The abundance [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#Chemical_composition"] in the Earth's crust is
approximately 16.9 ppm.[48] This is comparable to the crustal abundances of lead, cobalt, and niobium. Yet
unlike these elements, gallium does not form its own ore deposits with concentrations of > 0.1 wt.% in ore.
Rather it occurs at trace concentrations similar to the crustal value in zinc ores,[47][49] and at somewhat
Page 9
higher values (~ 50 ppm) in aluminium ores, from both of which it is extracted as a by-product. This lack of
independent deposits is due to gallium's geochemical behaviour, showing no strong enrichment in the
processes relevant to the formation of most ore deposits.[47]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Geological_Survey"] United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that more than 1 million tons of gallium is
contained in known reserves of bauxite and zinc ores.[50][51] Some coal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flue"] flue [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust"] dusts contain small quantities
of gallium, typically less than 1% by weight.[52][53][54][55] However, these amounts are not extractable
without mining of the host materials (see below).  Thus, the availability of gallium is fundamentally
determined by the rate at which bauxite, zinc ores (and coal) are extracted.
Production and availability
Gallium is produced exclusively as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By-product"] by-product during the
processing of the ores of other metals. Its main source material is
bauxite, the chief ore of aluminium, but minor amounts are also
extracted from sulfidic zinc ores ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphalerite"] sphalerite being the main host
mineral).[56][57] In the past, certain coals were an important source.
During the processing of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauxite"] bauxite to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_oxide"] alumina in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process"] Bayer process,
gallium accumulates in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide"] sodium hydroxide liquor. From this it
99.9999% (6N) gallium sealed in
vacuum ampoule 
can be extracted by a variety of methods. The most recent is the use
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion-exchange_resin"] ion-exchange resin.[56] Achievable extraction efficiencies
critically depend on the original concentration in the feed bauxite.
At a typical feed concentration of 50 ppm, about 15% of the
contained gallium is extractable.[56] The remainder reports to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_mud"] red mud and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_hydroxide"] aluminium hydroxide
streams. Gallium is removed from the ion-exchange resin in solution. Electrolysis then gives gallium metal.
For [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor"] semiconductor use, it is further purified with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_melting"] zone melting or single-crystal extraction from a melt
([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czochralski_process"] Czochralski process). Purities of 99.9999% are routinely achieved and commercially available.[58]
Its by-product status means that gallium production is constrained
by the amount of bauxite, sulfidic zinc ores (and coal) extracted per
year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of
supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as
that amount which is economically extractable from its host
materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology
and price).[59] Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-
products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the
main-products.[60] Recent estimates put the supply potential of  Bauxite mine in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica"] Jamaica (1984)
gallium at a minimum of 2,100 t/yr from bauxite, 85 t/yr from
sulfidic zinc ores, and potentially 590 t/yr from coal.[56] These
figures are significantly greater than current production (375 t in 2016).[61] Thus, major future increases in
the by-product production of gallium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or
price. The average price in for low-grade gallium was $120 per kilogram in 2016 and $135–140 per
kilogram in 2017.[62]
In 2017, the world's production of low-grade gallium was ca. 315 tons — an increase of 15% from 2016.
China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and Ukraine were the leading producers, while Germany ceased
primary production of gallium in 2016. The yield of high-purity gallium was ca. 180 tons, mostly
originating from China, Japan, Slovakia, UK and U.S. The 2017 world annual production capacity was
estimated at 730 tons for low-grade and 320 tons for refined gallium.[62]
Page 10
China produced ca. 250 tons of low-grade gallium in 2016 and ca. 300 tons in 2017. It also accounted for
more than half of global LED production.[62]
Applications
Semiconductor applications dominate the commercial demand for gallium, accounting for 98% of the total.
The next major application is for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadolinium_gallium_garnet"] gadolinium gallium garnets.[63]
Semiconductors
Extremely high-purity (>99.9999%)  gallium is commercially
available to serve the semiconductor industry. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium_arsenide"] Gallium arsenide
(GaAs) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium_nitride"] gallium nitride (GaN) used in electronic components
represented about 98% of the gallium consumption in the United
States in 2007. About 66% of semiconductor gallium is used in the
U.S. in integrated circuits (mostly gallium arsenide), such as the
manufacture of ultra-high-speed logic chips and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESFET"] MESFETs for low-
noise microwave preamplifiers in cell phones. About 20% of this
gallium is used in optoelectronics.[50] 
Gallium-based blue LEDs
Worldwide, gallium arsenide makes up 95% of the annual global
gallium consumption.[58] It amounted $7.5 billion in 2016, with 53% originating from cell phones, 27%
from wireless communications, and the rest from automotive, consumer, fiber-optic, and military
applications. The recent increase in GaAs consumption is mostly related to the emergence of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G"] 3G and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4G"] 4G
smartphones, which use 10 times more GaAs than older models.[62]
Gallium arsenide and gallium nitride can also be found in a variety of optoelectronic devices which had a
market share of $15.3 billion in 2015 and $18.5 billion in 2016.[62] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_gallium_arsenide"] Aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs)
is used in high-power infrared laser diodes. The semiconductors gallium nitride and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indium_gallium_nitride"] indium gallium nitride
are used in blue and violet optoelectronic devices, mostly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_diode"] laser diodes and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-emitting_diode"] light-emitting diodes. For
 example, gallium nitride 405 nm diode lasers are used as a violet light source for higher-density Blu-ray
Disc compact data disc drives.[64]
Other major application of gallium nitride are cable television transmission, commercial wireless
infrastructure, power electronics, and satellites. The GaN radio frequency device market alone was
estimated at $370 million in 2016 and $420 million in 2016.[62]
 Multijunction photovoltaic cells, developed for satellite power applications, are made by molecular-beam
epitaxy or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalorganic_vapour-phase_epitaxy"] metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxy of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_film"] thin films of gallium arsenide, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indium_gallium_phosphide"] indium gallium phosphide,
or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indium_gallium_arsenide"] indium gallium arsenide. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Exploration_Rover"] Mars Exploration Rovers and several satellites use triple-junction gallium
arsenide on germanium cells.[65] Gallium is also a component in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic"] photovoltaic compounds (such as copper
indium gallium selenium sulfide Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2
) used in solar panels as a cost-efficient alternative to
 crystalline silicon.[66]
Galinstan and other alloys
Gallium readily [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy"] alloys with most metals, and is used as an ingredient in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-melting_alloy"] low-melting alloys. The nearly
 eutectic alloy of gallium, indium, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin"] tin is a room temperature liquid used in medical thermometers. This
alloy, with the trade-name [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galinstan"] Galinstan (with the "-stan" referring to the tin, stannum in Latin), has a low
Page 11
freezing point of −19 °C (−2.2 °F).[67] It has been suggested that
this family of alloys could also be used to cool computer chips in
place of water, and is often used as a replacement for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_grease"] thermal paste
in high-performance computing.[68][69] Gallium alloys have been
evaluated as substitutes for mercury [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_amalgam"] dental amalgams, but these
materials have yet to see wide acceptance.
Because gallium [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetting"] wets glass or porcelain, gallium can be used to
create brilliant mirrors. When the wetting action of gallium-alloys is
not desired (as in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galinstan"] Galinstan glass thermometers), the glass must be
protected with a transparent layer of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium(III)_oxide"] gallium(III) oxide.[70]
 The plutonium used in nuclear weapon pits is stabilized in the δ
phase and made machinable by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutonium%E2%80%93gallium_alloy"] alloying with gallium.[71][72]

Biomedical applications
Although gallium has no natural function in biology, gallium ions
interact with processes in the body in a manner similar to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferric#Ferric_iron_and_life"] iron(III).
Because these processes include inflammation, a marker for many
disease states, several gallium salts are used (or are in development)
as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_drug"] pharmaceuticals and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiopharmacology"] radiopharmaceuticals in medicine. Interest
in the anticancer properties of gallium emerged when it was
discovered that 67Ga(III) citrate injected in tumor-bearing animals
localized to sites of tumor. Clinical trials have shown gallium nitrate
to have antineoplastic activity against non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Owing to their low melting points,
and urothelial cancers. A new generation of gallium-ligand gallium and its alloys can be shaped
complexes such as tris(8-quinolinolato)gallium(III) (KP46) and
gallium maltolate has emerged.[73] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium_nitrate"] Gallium nitrate (brand name 
 into various 3D forms using 3D
printing and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_manufacturing"] additive manufacturing
Ganite) has been used as an intravenous pharmaceutical to treat
 hypercalcemia associated with tumor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"] metastasis to bones. Gallium
is thought to interfere with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoclast"] osteoclast function, and the therapy may be effective when other treatments have
failed.[74] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium_maltolate"] Gallium maltolate, an oral, highly absorbable form of gallium(III) ion, is an anti-proliferative to
pathologically proliferating cells, particularly cancer cells and some bacteria that accept it in place of ferric
iron (Fe3+). Researchers are conducting clinical and preclinical trials on this compound as a potential
treatment for a number of cancers, infectious diseases, and inflammatory diseases.[75]
When gallium ions are mistakenly taken up in place of iron(III) by bacteria such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas"] Pseudomonas, the ions
interfere with respiration, and the bacteria die. This happens because iron is redox-active, allowing the
transfer of electrons during respiration, while gallium is redox-inactive.[76][77]
A complex amine-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenol"] phenol Ga(III) compound MR045 is selectively toxic to parasites resistant to
chloroquine, a common drug against malaria. Both the Ga(III) complex and chloroquine act by inhibiting
crystallization of hemozoin, a disposal product formed from the digestion of blood by the parasites.[78][79]
Radiogallium salts
 Gallium-67 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)"] salts such as gallium [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrate"] citrate and gallium [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate"] nitrate are used as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiopharmaceutical"] radiopharmaceutical agents in the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine"] nuclear medicine imaging known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium_scan"] gallium scan. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radionuclide"] radioactive isotope 67Ga is used, and the compound
or salt of gallium is unimportant. The body handles Ga3+ in many ways as though it were Fe3+, and the ion
Page 12
is bound (and concentrates) in areas of inflammation, such as infection, and in areas of rapid cell division.
This allows such sites to be imaged by nuclear scan techniques.[80]
 Gallium-68, a positron emitter with a half-life of 68 min, is now used as a diagnostic radionuclide in PET-
CT when linked to pharmaceutical preparations such as DOTATOC, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatostatin"] somatostatin analogue used for
 neuroendocrine tumors investigation, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOTA-TATE"] DOTA-TATE, a newer one, used for neuroendocrine [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastasis"] metastasis
and lung neuroendocrine cancer, such as certain types of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microcytoma&action=edit&redlink=1"] microcytoma. Gallium-68's preparation as a
 pharmaceutical is chemical, and the radionuclide is extracted by elution from germanium-68, a synthetic
radioisotope of germanium, in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallium-68_generator"] gallium-68 generators.[81]
Other uses
Neutrino detection: Gallium is used for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino"] neutrino detection. Possibly the largest amount of pure gallium
 ever collected in a single location is the Gallium-Germanium Neutrino Telescope used by the SAGE
experiment at the Baksan Neutrino Observatory in Russia. This detector contains 55–57 tonnes (~9 cubic
metres) of liquid gallium.[82] Another experiment was the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GALLEX"] GALLEX neutrino detector operated in the early
1990s in an Italian mountain tunnel. The detector contained 12.2 tons of watered gallium-71. Solar
neutrinos caused a few atoms of 71Ga to become radioactive 71Ge, which were detected. This experiment
showed that the solar neutrino flux is 40% less than theory predicted. This deficit was not explained until
better solar neutrino detectors and theories were constructed (see SNO).[83]
Ion source: Gallium is also used as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_metal_ion_source"] liquid metal ion source for a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focused_ion_beam"] focused ion beam. For example, a
focused gallium-ion beam was used to create the world's smallest book, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teeny_Ted_from_Turnip_Town"] Teeny Ted from Turnip Town.[84]
Lubricants: Gallium serves as an additive in glide wax for skis and other low-friction surface materials.[85]
Flexible electronics: Materials scientists speculate that the properties of gallium could make it suitable for
the development of flexible and wearable devices.[86][87]
Hydrogen generation: Gallium disrupts the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivation_(chemistry)"] protective oxide layer on aluminium, allowing water to react
with the aluminium in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlGa"] AlGa to produce hydrogen gas.[88]
Humor: A well-known [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical_joke"] practical joke among chemists is to fashion gallium spoons and use them to serve
tea to unsuspecting guests, since gallium has a similar appearance to its lighter homolog aluminium. The
spoons then melt in the hot tea.[89]
Gallium in the ocean
Advances in trace element testing have allowed scientists to discover traces of dissolved gallium in the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans [90] In recent years, dissolved gallium concentrations have presented in the
Beaufort Sea.[90][91] These reports reflect the possible profiles of the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean waters.[91]
For the Pacific Oceans, typical dissolved gallium concentrations are between 4–6 pmol/kg at depths <~150
m. In comparison, for Atlantic waters 25–28 pmol/kg at depths >~350 m.[91]
Gallium has entered our oceans mainly through aeolian input, but having gallium in our oceans can be used
to resolve aluminium distribution in the oceans.[92] The reason for this is that gallium is geochemically
similar to aluminium, just less reactive. Gallium also has a slightly larger surface water residence time than
aluminium.[92] Gallium has a similar dissolved profile similar to that of aluminium, due to this gallium can
be used as a tracer for aluminium.[92] Gallium can also be used as a tracer of aeolian inputs of iron.[93]
Gallium is used as a tracer for iron in the northwest Pacific, south and central Atlantic Oceans.[93] For
Page 13
example, in the northwest Pacific, low gallium surface waters, in the subpolar region suggest that there is
low dust input, which can subsequently explain the following [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-nutrient,_low-chlorophyll"] high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll environmental
behavior.[93]
Precautions
Metallic gallium is not toxic. However, exposure to gallium halide
complexes can result in acute toxicity.[96] The Ga3+ ion of soluble
gallium salts tends to form the insoluble hydroxide when injected
in large doses; precipitation of this hydroxide resulted in
 nephrotoxicity in animals. In lower doses, soluble gallium is
tolerated well and does not accumulate as a poison, instead being
excreted mostly through urine. Excretion of gallium occurs in two
phases: the first phase has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_half-life"] biological half-life of 1 hour, while the
second has a biological half-life of 25 hours.[80]
