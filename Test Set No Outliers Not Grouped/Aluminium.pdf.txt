Aluminium
Aluminium (aluminum in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmE"] American and
 Canadian English) is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"] chemical element with the
symbol  Al and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number"] atomic number 13. Aluminium
has a density lower than those of other common
metals, at approximately one third that of steel. It
 has a great affinity towards oxygen, and forms a
protective layer of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_oxide"] oxide on the surface when
exposed to air. Aluminium visually resembles
silver, both in its color and in its great ability to
reflect light. It is soft, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"] non-magnetic and ductile. It
has one stable isotope, 27Al; this isotope is very
common, making aluminium the twelfth most
common element in the Universe. The
radioactivity of 26[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminum-26"] Al is used in radiodating.
Chemically, aluminium is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-transition_metal"] post-transition metal
in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_group"] boron group; as is common for the group,
aluminium forms compounds primarily in the +3
 oxidation state. The aluminium [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation"] cation Al3+ is
small and highly charged; as such, it is polarizing,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"] bonds aluminium forms tend towards
covalency. The strong affinity towards oxygen
leads to aluminium's common association with
oxygen in nature in the form of oxides; for this
reason, aluminium is found on Earth primarily in
rocks in the crust, where it is the third most
abundant element after [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen"] oxygen and silicon, rather
than in the mantle, and virtually never as the free
metal.
The discovery of aluminium was announced in
1825 by Danish physicist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_%C3%98rsted"] Hans Christian Ørsted.
The first industrial production of aluminium was
 initiated by French chemist Henri Étienne Sainte-
Claire Deville in 1856. Aluminium became much
 more available to the public with the Hall–
Héroult process developed independently by
French engineer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_H%C3%A9roult"] Paul Héroult and American
engineer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Martin_Hall"] Charles Martin Hall in 1886, and the
mass production of aluminium led to its extensive
use in industry and everyday life. In World Wars [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I"] I
and II, aluminium was a crucial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_resource"] strategic resource
for aviation. In 1954, aluminium became the most
produced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ferrous_metal"] non-ferrous metal, surpassing copper.
In the 21st century, most aluminium was

Despite its prevalence in the environment, no
living organism is known to use aluminium [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)"] salts
metabolically, but aluminium is well tolerated by
plants and animals. Because of the abundance of
these salts, the potential for a biological role for
them is of continuing interest, and studies
continue.

isotope. This makes aluminium very useful in
 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), as its single

therefore a detectable amount has not survived
since the formation of the planet.[8] However, minute traces of 26Al are produced from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon"] argon in the
 atmosphere by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spallation"] spallation caused by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray"] cosmic ray protons. The ratio of 26Al to 10[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium-10"] Be has been used for
 radiodating of geological processes over 105 to 106 year time scales, in particular transport, deposition,
 sediment storage, burial times, and erosion.[9] Most meteorite scientists believe that the energy released by
the decay of 26Al was responsible for the melting and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetary_differentiation"] differentiation of some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids"] asteroids after their formation
4.55 billion years ago.[10]
The remaining isotopes of aluminium, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_number"] mass numbers ranging from 22 to 43, all have half-lives well
under an hour. Three [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastable"] metastable states are known, all with half-lives under a minute.[5]
Electron shell
An aluminium atom has 13 electrons, arranged in an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_configuration"] electron configuration of [Ne] 3s2 3p1,[11] with three
electrons beyond a stable noble gas configuration. Accordingly, the combined first three [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization_energy"] ionization energies
of aluminium are far lower than the fourth ionization energy alone.[12] Such an electron configuration is
Page 4
shared with the other well-characterized members of its group, boron, gallium, indium, and thallium; it is
also expected for nihonium. Aluminium can relatively easily surrender its three outermost electrons in many
chemical reactions (see below). The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity"] electronegativity of aluminium is 1.61 (Pauling scale).[13]
High-resolution STEM-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annular_dark-field_imaging"] HAADF micrograph
of Al atoms viewed along the [001] zone
axis. 
A free aluminium atom has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_radius"] radius of 143 pm.[14] With the
three outermost electrons removed, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_radius"] radius shrinks to
39 pm for a 4-coordinated atom or 53.5 pm for a 6-
coordinated atom.[14] At [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_conditions_for_temperature_and_pressure"] standard temperature and pressure,
aluminium atoms (when not affected by atoms of other
elements) form a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubic_crystal_system"] face-centered cubic crystal system bound
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_bonding"] metallic bonding provided by atoms' outermost electrons;
hence aluminium (at these conditions) is a metal.[15] This
crystal system is shared by many other metals, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"] lead
and copper; the size of a unit cell of aluminium is comparable
to that of those other metals.[15] The system, however, is not
shared by the other members of its group; boron has
ionization energies too high to allow metallization, thallium
has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_close-packed"] hexagonal close-packed structure, and gallium and
indium have unusual structures that are not close-packed like
those of aluminium and thallium. The few electrons that are
available for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_bonding"] metallic bonding in aluminium metal are a
probable cause for it being soft with a low melting point and
low [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity"] electrical resistivity.[16]
Bulk
 Aluminium metal has an appearance ranging from silvery white to dull gray, depending on the surface
roughness.{{efn|The two sides of aluminium foil differ in their luster: one is shiny and the other is dull. The
difference is due to the small mechanical damage on the surface of dull side arising from the technological
process of aluminium foil manufacturing.[17] Both sides reflect similar amounts of visible light, but the
shiny side reflects a far greater share of visible light [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection"] specularly whereas the dull side almost exclusively
 diffuses light. Both sides of aluminium foil serve as good [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectance"] reflectors (approximately 86%) of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_light"] visible light
and an excellent reflector (as much as 97%) of medium and far [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"] infrared radiation.[18] Aluminium mirrors
are the most reflective of all metal mirrors for the near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet"] ultraviolet and far [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"] infrared light, and one of the most
reflective in the visible spectrum, nearly on par with silver, and the two therefore look similar. Aluminium is
also good at reflecting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_radiation"] solar radiation, although prolonged exposure to sunlight in air adds wear to the
surface of the metal; this may be prevented if aluminium is anodized, which adds a protective layer of oxideon the surface.
The density of aluminium is 2.70 g/cm3, about 1/3 that of steel, much lower than other commonly
encountered metals, making aluminium parts easily identifiable through their lightness.[19] Aluminium's
low density compared to most other metals arises from the fact that its nuclei are much lighter, while
difference in the unit cell size does not compensate for this difference. The only lighter metals are the metals
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metal"] groups 1 and 2, which apart from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium"] beryllium and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"] magnesium are too reactive for structural use (and
beryllium is very toxic).[20] Aluminium is not as strong or stiff as steel, but the low density makes up for
this in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace"] aerospace industry and for many other applications where light weight and relatively high
strength are crucial.[21]
Pure aluminium is quite soft and lacking in strength. In most applications various [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_alloys"] aluminium alloys are used
instead because of their higher strength and hardness.[22] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_(engineering)"] yield strength of pure aluminium is 7–11
MPa, while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_alloy"] aluminium alloys have yield strengths ranging from 200 MPa to 600 MPa.[23] Aluminium is
Page 5
ductile, with a percent elongation of 50-70%,[24] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleable"] malleable allowing it to be easily [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_(metalworking)"] drawn and
extruded.[25] It is also easily [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machining"] machined and cast.[25]
Aluminium is an excellent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_conduction"] thermal and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor"] electrical conductor, having around 60% the conductivity of copper,
both thermal and electrical, while having only 30% of copper's density.[26] Aluminium is capable of
superconductivity, with a superconducting critical temperature of 1.2 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin"] kelvin and a critical magnetic field of
about 100 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_(unit)"] gauss (10 milliteslas).[27] It is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramagnetic"] paramagnetic and thus essentially unaffected by static magnetic
fields.[28] The high electrical conductivity, however, means that it is strongly affected by alternating
magnetic fields through the induction of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_currents"] eddy currents.[29]
Chemistry
Aluminium combines characteristics of pre- and post-transition metals. Since it has few available electrons
for metallic bonding, like its heavier [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_13_element"] group 13 congeners, it has the characteristic physical properties of a
post-transition metal, with longer-than-expected interatomic distances.[16] Furthermore, as Al3+ is a small
and highly charged cation, it is strongly polarizing and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond"] bonding in aluminium compounds tends towards
covalency;[30] this behavior is similar to that of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium"] beryllium (Be2+), and the two display an example of a
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonal_relationship"] diagonal relationship.[31]
The underlying core under aluminium's valence shell is that of the preceding [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_gas"] noble gas, whereas those of its
heavier congeners gallium, indium, thallium, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihonium"] nihonium also include a filled d-subshell and in some
cases a filled f-subshell. Hence, the inner electrons of aluminium shield the valence electrons almost
completely, unlike those of aluminium's heavier congeners. As such, aluminium is the most electropositive
metal in its group, and its hydroxide is in fact more basic than that of gallium.[30][d] Aluminium also bears
minor similarities to the metalloid boron in the same group: AlX3 compounds are valence [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoelectronic"] isoelectronic to
BX3 compounds (they have the same valence electronic structure), and both behave as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_acid"] Lewis acids and
readily form adducts.[32] Additionally, one of the main motifs of boron chemistry is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_icosahedron"] regular icosahedral
structures, and aluminium forms an important part of many icosahedral [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasicrystal"] quasicrystal alloys, including the
Al–Zn–Mg class.[33]
Aluminium has a high [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_affinity"] chemical affinity to oxygen, which renders it suitable for use as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reducing_agent"] reducing agent in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite"] thermite reaction. A fine powder of aluminium metal reacts explosively on contact with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_oxygen"] liquid oxygen;
under normal conditions, however, aluminium forms a thin oxide layer (~5 nm at room temperature)[34] that
protects the metal from further corrosion by oxygen, water, or dilute acid, a process termed
passivation.[30][35] Because of its general resistance to corrosion, aluminium is one of the few metals that
retains silvery reflectance in finely powdered form, making it an important component of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_(color)"] silver-colored
paints.[36] Aluminium is not attacked by oxidizing acids because of its passivation. This allows aluminium
to be used to store reagents such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitric_acid"] nitric acid, concentrated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid"] sulfuric acid, and some organic acids.[37]
In hot concentrated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid"] hydrochloric acid, aluminium reacts with water with evolution of hydrogen, and in
aqueous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide"] sodium hydroxide or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_hydroxide"] potassium hydroxide at room temperature to form aluminates—protective
passivation under these conditions is negligible.[38] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_regia"] Aqua regia also dissolves aluminium.[37] Aluminium is
corroded by dissolved chlorides, such as common [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride"] sodium chloride, which is why household plumbing is
never made from aluminium.[38] The oxide layer on aluminium is also destroyed by contact with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)"] mercury
due to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalgam_(chemistry)"] amalgamation or with salts of some electropositive metals.[30] As such, the strongest aluminium
alloys are less corrosion-resistant due to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_cell"] galvanic reactions with alloyed copper,[23] and aluminium's
corrosion resistance is greatly reduced by aqueous salts, particularly in the presence of dissimilar metals.[16]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millitesla"]

Aluminium reacts with most nonmetals upon heating, forming compounds such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_nitride"] aluminium nitride
(AlN), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_sulfide"] aluminium sulfide (Al2S3), and the aluminium halides (AlX3). It also forms a wide range of
 intermetallic compounds involving metals from every group on the periodic table.[30]
Inorganic compounds
The vast majority of compounds, including all aluminium-containing minerals and all commercially
significant aluminium compounds, feature aluminium in the oxidation state 3+. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_number"] coordination number of
such compounds varies, but generally Al3+ is either six- or four-coordinate. Almost all compounds of
aluminium(III) are colorless.[30]
In aqueous solution, Al3+ exists as the hexaaqua cation
[Al(H2O)6]3+,  which has an approximate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_dissociation_constant"] Ka of 10−5.[6] Such
solutions are acidic as this cation can act as a proton donor and
progressively [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"] hydrolyze until a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation_(chemistry)"] precipitate of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_hydroxide"] aluminium hydroxide,
Al(OH)3, forms. This is useful for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedimentation_(water_treatment)"] clarification of water, as the
precipitate nucleates on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)"] suspended particles in the water, hence
removing them. Increasing the pH even further leads to the
hydroxide dissolving again as aluminate, [Al(H2O)2(OH)4]−,  is
formed.
Aluminium hydroxide forms both salts and aluminates and
dissolves in acid and alkali, as well as on fusion with acidic and
basic oxides.[30] This behavior of Al(OH)3 is termed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphoterism"] amphoterism
and is characteristic of weakly basic cations that form insoluble
hydroxides and whose hydrated species can also donate their
protons. One effect of this is that aluminium salts with weak acids

Mesmer)[39]
are hydrolyzed in water to the aquated hydroxide and the
corresponding nonmetal hydride: for example, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_sulfide"] aluminium sulfide
yields [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide"] hydrogen sulfide. However, some salts like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_carbonate"] aluminium carbonate exist in aqueous solution but are
unstable as such; and only incomplete hydrolysis takes place for salts with strong acids, such as the halides,
nitrate, and sulfate. For similar reasons, anhydrous aluminium salts cannot be made by heating their
"hydrates": hydrated aluminium chloride is in fact not AlCl3·6H2O but [Al(H2O)6]Cl3, and the Al–O
bonds are so strong that heating is not sufficient to break them and form Al–Cl bonds instead:[30]

All four [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halide"] trihalides are well known. Unlike the structures of the three heavier trihalides, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_fluoride"] aluminium fluoride
(AlF3) features six-coordinate aluminium, which explains its involatility and insolubility as well as high
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_of_formation"] heat of formation. Each aluminium atom is surrounded by six fluorine atoms in a distorted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedron"] octahedral
arrangement, with each fluorine atom being shared between the corners of two octahedra. Such {AlF6}
units also exist in complex fluorides such as cryolite, Na3AlF6.[e] AlF3 melts at 1,290 °C (2,354 °F) and is
made by reaction of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_oxide"] aluminium oxide with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_fluoride"] hydrogen fluoride gas at 700 °C (1,300 °F).[40]
With heavier halides, the coordination numbers are lower. The other trihalides are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimer_(chemistry)"] dimeric or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer"] polymeric
with tetrahedral four-coordinate aluminium centers.[f] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_trichloride"] Aluminium trichloride (AlCl3) has a layered
polymeric structure below its melting point of 192.4 °C (378 °F) but transforms on melting to Al2Cl6
dimers. At higher temperatures those increasingly dissociate into trigonal planar AlCl3 monomers similar to
Page 7
the structure of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boron_trichloride"] BCl3. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_tribromide"] Aluminium tribromide and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_triiodide"] aluminium triiodide form Al2X6 dimers in all three phases
and hence do not show such significant changes of properties upon phase change.[40] These materials are
 prepared by treating aluminium metal with the halogen. The aluminium trihalides form many addition
 compounds or complexes; their Lewis acidic nature makes them useful as catalysts for the Friedel–Crafts
reactions. Aluminium trichloride has major industrial uses involving this reaction, such as in the
manufacture of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthraquinone"] anthraquinones and styrene; it is also often used as the precursor for many other aluminium
compounds and as a reagent for converting nonmetal fluorides into the corresponding chlorides (a
 transhalogenation reaction).[40]
Aluminium forms one stable oxide with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_formula"] chemical formula Al2O3, commonly called alumina.[41] It can
be found in nature in the mineral corundum, α-alumina;[42] there is also a γ-alumina phase.[6] Its crystalline
form, corundum, is very hard ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_hardness"] Mohs hardness 9), has a high melting point of 2,045 °C (3,713 °F), has very
low volatility, is chemically inert, and a good electrical insulator, it is often used in abrasives (such as
toothpaste),  as a refractory material, and in ceramics, as well as being the starting material for the
electrolytic production of aluminium metal. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapphire"] Sapphire and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby"] ruby are impure corundum contaminated with
trace amounts of other metals.[6] The two main oxide-hydroxides, AlO(OH), are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boehmite"] boehmite and diaspore.
There are three main trihydroxides: bayerite, gibbsite, and nordstrandite, which differ in their crystalline
structure (polymorphs).  Many other intermediate and related structures are also known.[6] Most are
produced from ores by a variety of wet processes using acid and base. Heating the hydroxides leads to
formation of corundum. These materials are of central importance to the production of aluminium and are
themselves extremely useful. Some mixed oxide phases are also very useful, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinel"] spinel (MgAl2O4),
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_cement"] Na-β-alumina (NaAl11O17), and tricalcium aluminate (Ca3Al2O6, an important mineral phase in Portland
cement).[6]
The only stable [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcogenide"] chalcogenides under normal conditions are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_sulfide"] aluminium sulfide (Al2S3), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_selenide"] selenide (Al2Se3),
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Aluminium_telluride&action=edit&redlink=1"] telluride (Al2Te3). All three are prepared by direct reaction of their elements at about 1,000 °C
(1,800 °F) and quickly hydrolyze completely in water to yield aluminium hydroxide and the respective
 hydrogen chalcogenide. As aluminium is a small atom relative to these chalcogens, these have four-
coordinate tetrahedral aluminium with various polymorphs having structures related to wurtzite, with two-
thirds of the possible metal sites occupied either in an orderly (α) or random (β) fashion; the sulfide also has
a γ form related to γ-alumina, and an unusual high-temperature hexagonal form where half the aluminium
atoms have tetrahedral four-coordination and the other half have trigonal bipyramidal five-coordination. [43]
Four [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pnictide"] pnictides – [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_nitride"] aluminium nitride (AlN), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_phosphide"] aluminium phosphide (AlP), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_arsenide"] aluminium arsenide (AlAs), and
 aluminium antimonide (AlSb) – are known. They are all [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/III-V_semiconductor"] III-V semiconductors isoelectronic to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon"] silicon and
germanium, all of which but AlN have the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc_blende"] zinc blende structure. All four can be made by high-temperature
(and possibly high-pressure) direct reaction of their component elements.[43]
Aluminium alloys well with most other metals (with the exception of most [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkali_metals"] alkali metals and group 13
metals) and over 150 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermetallics"] intermetallics with other metals are known. Preparation involves heating fixed metals
together in certain proportion, followed by gradual cooling and annealing. Bonding in them is
predominantly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_bonding"] metallic and the crystal structure primarily depends on efficiency of packing.[44]
There are few compounds with lower oxidation states. A few [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium(I)"] aluminium(I) compounds exist: AlF, AlCl,
AlBr, and AlI exist in the gaseous phase when the respective trihalide is heated with aluminium, and at
cryogenic temperatures.[40] A stable derivative of aluminium monoiodide is the cyclic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adduct"] adduct formed with
triethylamine, Al4I4(NEt3)4. Al2O and Al2S also exist but are very unstable.[45] Very simple aluminium(II)
 compounds are invoked or observed in the reactions of Al metal with oxidants. For example, aluminium
monoxide, AlO, has been detected in the gas phase after explosion[46] and in stellar absorption spectra.[47]
More thoroughly investigated are compounds of the formula R4Al2 which contain an Al–Al bond and
where R is a large organic ligand.[48]

Organoaluminium compounds and related hydrides
A variety of compounds of empirical formula AlR3  and
AlR1.5Cl1.5 exist.[49] The aluminium trialkyls and triaryls are
reactive, volatile, and colorless liquids or low-melting solids. They
catch fire spontaneously in air and react with water, thus
necessitating precautions when handling them. They often form
dimers, unlike their boron analogues, but this tendency diminishes
for branched-chain alkyls (e.g. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isopropyl"] Pri, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isobutyl"] Bui, Me3CCH2); for example,
 triisobutylaluminium exists as an equilibrium mixture of the
monomer and dimer.[50][51] These dimers, such as
 trimethylaluminium (Al2Me6), usually feature tetrahedral Al centers
formed by dimerization with some alkyl group bridging between
both aluminium atoms. They are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSAB_theory"] hard acids and react readily with 
Structure of trimethylaluminium, a
compound that features five-
coordinate carbon.
ligands, forming adducts. In industry, they are mostly used in
alkene insertion reactions, as discovered by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Ziegler"] Karl Ziegler, most importantly in "growth reactions" that form
long-chain unbranched primary alkenes and alcohols, and in the low-pressure polymerization of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethene"] ethene and
propene. There are also some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterocycle"] heterocyclic and cluster organoaluminium compounds involving Al–N
bonds.[50]
The industrially most important aluminium hydride is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_aluminium_hydride"] lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH4), which is used
 in as a reducing agent in organic chemistry. It can be produced from lithium hydride and aluminium
trichloride.[52] The simplest hydride, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_hydride"] aluminium hydride or alane, is not as important. It is a polymer with
the formula (AlH3)n, in contrast to the corresponding boron hydride that is a dimer with the formula
(BH3)2.[52]
Natural occurrence
Space
Aluminium's per-particle abundance in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System"] Solar System is 3.15 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_per_million"] ppm (parts per million).[53][g] It is the
twelfth most abundant of all elements and third most abundant among the elements that have odd atomic
numbers, after hydrogen and nitrogen.[53] The only stable isotope of aluminium, 27Al, is the eighteenth
most abundant nucleus in the Universe. It is created almost entirely after fusion of carbon in massive stars
that will later become [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_II_supernova"] Type II supernovas: this fusion creates 26Mg, which, upon capturing free protons and
neutrons becomes aluminium. Some smaller quantities of 27Al are created in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_burning"] hydrogen burning shells of
evolved stars, where 26Mg can capture free protons.[54] Essentially all aluminium now in existence is 27Al.
26Al was present in the early Solar System with abundance of 0.005% relative to 27Al but its half-life of
728,000 years is too short for any original nuclei to survive; 26Al is therefore extinct.[54] Unlike for 27Al,
hydrogen burning is the primary source of 26Al, with the nuclide emerging after a nucleus of 25Mg catches
a free proton. However, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_radioisotope"] trace quantities of 26Al that do exist are the most common [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_ray"] gamma ray emitter
in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_gas"] interstellar gas;[54] if the original 26Al were still present, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_astronomy"] gamma ray maps of the Milky Way would
be brighter.[54]
Earth
Page 9
Overall, the Earth is about 1.59% aluminium by mass (seventh in
abundance by mass).[55] Aluminium occurs in greater proportion in
the Earth's crust than in the Universe at large, because aluminium
easily forms the oxide and becomes bound into rocks and stays in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_crust"] Earth's crust, while less reactive metals sink to the core.[54] In
the Earth's crust, aluminium is the most abundant metallic element
(8.23% by mass[24]) and the third most abundant of all elements
(after oxygen and silicon).[56] A large number of silicates in the
Earth's crust contain aluminium.[57] In contrast, the Earth's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)"] mantle
is only 2.38% aluminium by mass.[58] Aluminium also occurs in  Bauxite, a major aluminium ore. The
seawater at a concentration of 2 μg/kg.[24]  red-brown color is due to the
presence of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_oxide"] iron oxide minerals.
Because of its strong affinity for oxygen, aluminium is almost never
found in the elemental state; instead it is found in oxides or silicates.
Feldspars, the most common group of minerals in the Earth's crust, are aluminosilicates. Aluminium also
occurs in the minerals beryl, cryolite, garnet, spinel, and turquoise.[59] Impurities in Al2O3,  such as
 chromium and iron, yield the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemstone"] gemstones [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby"] ruby and sapphire, respectively.[60] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_aluminium"] Native aluminium metal is
extremely rare and can only be found as a minor phase in low oxygen [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugacity"] fugacity environments, such as the
interiors of certain volcanoes.[61] Native aluminium has been reported in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_seep"] cold seeps in the northeastern
 continental slope of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea"] South China Sea. It is possible that these deposits resulted from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria"] bacterial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"] reduction
of tetrahydroxoaluminate Al(OH)4−.[62]
Although aluminium is a common and widespread element, not all aluminium minerals are economically
viable sources of the metal. Almost all metallic aluminium is produced from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore"] ore [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauxite"] bauxite (AlOx(OH)3–
2x).  Bauxite occurs as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weathering"] weathering product of low iron and silica bedrock in tropical climatic
conditions.[63] In 2017, most bauxite was mined in Australia, China, Guinea, and India.[64]
History
The history of aluminium has been shaped by usage of alum. The first
written record of alum, made by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece"] Greek historian Herodotus, dates back to
the 5th century BCE.[65] The ancients are known to have used alum as a
dyeing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordant"] mordant and for city defense.[65] After the Crusades, alum, an
indispensable good in the European fabric industry,[66] was a subject of
international commerce;[67] it was imported to Europe from the eastern
Mediterranean until the mid-15th century.[68]
The nature of alum remained unknown. Around 1530, Swiss physician
 Paracelsus suggested alum was a salt of an earth of alum.[69] In 1595,
German doctor and chemist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Libavius"] Andreas Libavius experimentally confirmed
this.[70] In 1722, German chemist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hoffmann"] Friedrich Hoffmann announced his belief
that the base of alum was a distinct earth.[71] In 1754, German chemist
 Andreas Sigismund Marggraf synthesized alumina by boiling clay in
sulfuric acid and subsequently adding potash.[71] 
 Friedrich Wöhler, the
chemist who first thoroughly
described metallic elemental
aluminium
Attempts to produce aluminium metal date back to 1760.[72] The first successful attempt, however, was
completed in 1824 by Danish physicist and chemist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_%C3%98rsted"] Hans Christian Ørsted. He reacted anhydrous
 aluminium chloride with potassium amalgam, yielding a lump of metal looking similar to tin.[73][74][75] He
presented his results and demonstrated a sample of the new metal in 1825.[76][77] In 1827, German chemist
 Friedrich Wöhler repeated Ørsted's experiments but did not identify any aluminium.[78] (The reason for this
Page 10
inconsistency was only discovered in 1921.)[79] He conducted a similar experiment in the same year by
mixing anhydrous aluminium chloride with potassium and produced a powder of aluminium.[75] In 1845,
he was able to produce small pieces of the metal and described some physical properties of this metal.[79]
For many years thereafter, Wöhler was credited as the discoverer of aluminium.[80]
As Wöhler's method could not yield great quantities of aluminium, the
metal remained rare; its cost exceeded that of gold.[78] The first industrial
 production of aluminium was established in 1856 by French chemist Henri
Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville and companions.[81] Deville had discovered
that aluminium trichloride could be reduced by sodium, which was more
convenient and less expensive than potassium, which Wöhler had used.[82]
Even then, aluminium was still not of great purity and produced aluminium
differed in properties by sample.[83] Because of its electricity-conducting
capacity, aluminium was used as the cap of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Monument"] Washington Monument,
completed in 1885. The tallest building in the world at the time, the non-
corroding metal cap was intended to serve as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_rod"] lightning rod peak.
The first industrial large-scale production method was independently
developed in 1886 by French engineer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_H%C3%A9roult"] Paul Héroult and American
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall%E2%80%93H%C3%A9roult_process"] engineer Charles Martin Hall; it is now known as the Hall–Héroult
process.[84] The Hall–Héroult process converts alumina into metal.
Austrian chemist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Josef_Bayer"] Carl Joseph Bayer discovered a way of purifying bauxite
to yield alumina, now known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process"] Bayer process, in 1889.[85] Modern
production of the aluminium metal is based on the Bayer and Hall–Héroult
processes.[86] 
The statue of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anteros"] Anteros in
 Piccadilly Circus, London,
was made in 1893 and is
one of the first statues cast
in aluminium.
Prices of aluminium dropped and aluminium became widely used in jewelry, everyday items, eyeglass
frames, optical instruments, tableware, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_foil"] foil in the 1890s and early 20th century. Aluminium's ability to
form hard yet light alloys with other metals provided the metal with many uses at the time.[87] During
 World War I, major governments demanded large shipments of aluminium for light strong airframes;[88]
during [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"] World War II, demand by major governments for aviation was even higher.[89][90][91]
By the mid-20th century, aluminium had become a part of everyday life and an essential component of
housewares.[92] In 1954, production of aluminium surpassed that of copper,[h] historically second in
production only to iron,[95] making it the most produced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ferrous_metal"] non-ferrous metal. During the mid-20th century,
aluminium emerged as a civil engineering material, with building applications in both basic construction
and interior finish work,[96] and increasingly being used in military engineering, for both airplanes and land
armor vehicle engines.[97] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1"] Earth's first artificial satellite, launched in 1957, consisted of two separate
aluminium semi-spheres joined and all subsequent space vehicles have used aluminium to some extent.[86]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_can"] aluminium can was invented in 1956 and employed as a storage for drinks in 1958.[98]
Throughout the 20th century, the production of aluminium rose rapidly: while the world production of
aluminium in 1900 was 6,800 metric tons, the annual production first exceeded 100,000 metric tons in
1916; 1,000,000 tons in 1941; 10,000,000 tons in 1971.[93] In the 1970s, the increased demand for
aluminium made it an exchange commodity; it entered the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Metal_Exchange"] London Metal Exchange, the oldest industrial
metal exchange in the world, in 1978.[86] The output continued to grow: the annual production of
aluminium exceeded 50,000,000 metric tons in 2013.[93]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_price"] real price for aluminium declined from $14,000 per metric ton in 1900 to $2,340 in 1948 (in 1998
United States dollars).[93] Extraction and processing costs were lowered over technological progress and
the scale of the economies. However, the need to exploit lower-grade poorer quality deposits and the use of
Page 11
fast increasing input costs (above all, energy) increased the net cost
of aluminium;[99] the real price began to grow in the 1970s with the
rise of energy cost.[100] Production moved from the industrialized
countries to countries where production was cheaper.[101]
Production costs in the late 20th century changed because of
advances in technology, lower energy prices, exchange rates of the
United States dollar, and alumina prices.[102] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRIC"] BRIC countries'
combined share in primary production and primary consumption
grew substantially in the first decade of the 21st century.[103] China
is accumulating an especially large share of the world's production
thanks to an abundance of resources, cheap energy, and World production of aluminium since
governmental stimuli;[104] it also increased its consumption share 1900
from 2% in 1972 to 40% in 2010.[105] In the United States,
Western Europe, and Japan, most aluminium was consumed in
transportation, engineering, construction, and packaging.[106] In 2021, prices for industrial metals such as
aluminium have soared to near-record levels as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_global_energy_crisis"] energy shortages in China drive up costs for electricity.[107]
Etymology
The names aluminium and aluminum are derived from the word alumine, an obsolete term for alumina,[i] a
 naturally occurring oxide of aluminium.[109] Alumine was borrowed from French, which in turn derived it
from alumen, the classical Latin name for alum, the mineral from which it was collected.[110] The Latin
word alumen stems from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language"] Proto-Indo-European root *alu- meaning "bitter" or "beer".[111]
Coinage
British chemist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphry_Davy"] Humphry Davy, who performed a number of experiments
aimed to isolate the metal, is credited as the person who named the element.
The first name proposed for the metal to be isolated from alum was
alumium, which Davy suggested in an 1808 article on his electrochemical
research, published in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Transactions_of_the_Royal_Society"] Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.[112]
It appeared that the name was coined from the English word alum and the
Latin suffix -ium; but it was customary then to give elements names
originating in Latin, so that this name was not adopted universally. This
name was criticized by contemporary chemists from France, Germany, and
Sweden, who insisted the metal should be named for the oxide, alumina,
from which it would be isolated.[113] The English name alum does not
come directly from Latin, whereas alumine/alumina obviously comes from
the Latin word alumen (upon declension, alumen changes to alumin-).  1897 American
advertisement featuring the
One example was Essai sur la Nomenclature chimique (July 1811), written aluminum spelling
in French by a Swedish chemist, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6ns_Jacob_Berzelius"] Jöns Jacob Berzelius, in which the name
aluminium is given to the element that would be synthesized from
alum.[114][j] (Another article in the same journal issue also gives the name aluminium to the metal whose
oxide is the basis of sapphire.)[116] A January 1811 summary of one of Davy's lectures at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society"] Royal Society
mentioned the name aluminium as a possibility.[117] The next year, Davy published a chemistry textbook in
which he used the spelling aluminum.[118] Both spellings have coexisted since. Their usage is regional:
aluminum dominates in the United States and Canada; aluminium, in the rest of the English-speaking
world.[119]
Page 12
Spelling
In 1812, a British scientist, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Young_(scientist)"] Thomas Young,[120] wrote an anonymous review of Davy's book, in which he
proposed the name aluminium instead of aluminum, which he thought had a "less classical sound".[121]
This name did catch on: although the -um spelling was occasionally used in Britain, the American scientific
language used -ium from the start.[122] Most scientists throughout the world used -ium in the 19th
century;[119] and it was entrenched in many other European languages, such as French, German, and
Dutch.[k] In 1828, an American lexicographer, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Webster"] Noah Webster, entered only the aluminum spelling in his
 American Dictionary of the English Language.[123] In the 1830s, the -um spelling gained usage in the
United States; by the 1860s, it had become the more common spelling there outside science.[122] In 1892,
Hall used the -um spelling in his advertising handbill for his new electrolytic method of producing the
metal, despite his constant use of the -ium spelling in all the patents he filed between 1886 and 1903: it is
unknown whether this spelling was introduced by mistake or intentionally; but Hall preferred aluminum
since its introduction because it resembled [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"] platinum, the name of a prestigious metal.[124] By 1890, both
spellings had been common in the United States, the -ium spelling being slightly more common; by 1895,
the situation had reversed; by 1900, aluminum had become twice as common as aluminium; in the next
decade, the -um spelling dominated American usage. In 1925, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Chemical_Society"] American Chemical Society adopted this
spelling.[119]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_of_Pure_and_Applied_Chemistry"] International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted aluminium as the standard
international name for the element in 1990.[125] In 1993, they recognized aluminum as an acceptable
variant;[125] the most recent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAC_nomenclature_of_inorganic_chemistry_2005"] 2005 edition of the IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry also
acknowledges this spelling.[126] IUPAC official publications use the -ium spelling as primary, and they list
both where it is appropriate.[l]
Production and refinement
The production of aluminium starts with the extraction of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauxite"] bauxite rock from the ground. The bauxite is
 processed and transformed using the Bayer process into alumina, which is then processed using the Hall–
Héroult process, resulting in the final aluminium metal.
Aluminium production is highly energy-consuming, and so the producers tend to locate smelters in places
where electric power is both plentiful and inexpensive.[128] As of 2019, the world's largest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelting"] smelters of
aluminium are located in China, India, Russia, Canada, and the United Arab Emirates,[129] while China is
by far the top producer of aluminium with a world share of fifty-five percent.
According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Resource_Panel"] International Resource Panel's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Stocks_in_Society_report"] Metal Stocks in Society report, the global [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_capita"] per capita stock
of aluminium in use in society (i.e. in cars, buildings, electronics, etc.) is 80 kg (180 lb). Much of this is in
more-developed countries (350–500 kg (770–1,100 lb) per capita) rather than less-developed countries
(35 kg (77 lb) per capita).[130]
Bayer process
 Bauxite is converted to alumina by the Bayer process. Bauxite is blended for uniform composition and then
is ground. The resulting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurry"] slurry is mixed with a hot solution of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide"] sodium hydroxide; the mixture is then treated
in a digester vessel at a pressure well above atmospheric, dissolving the aluminium hydroxide in bauxite
while converting impurities into relatively insoluble compounds:[131]
Al(OH)3 + Na+ + OH− → Na+ + [Al(OH)4]−
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process"]
Page 13
After this reaction, the slurry is at a temperature above its atmospheric boiling point. It is cooled by
removing steam as pressure is reduced. The bauxite residue is separated from the solution and discarded.
The solution, free of solids, is seeded with small crystals of aluminium hydroxide; this causes
decomposition of the [Al(OH)4]− ions to aluminium hydroxide. After about half of aluminium has
precipitated, the mixture is sent to classifiers. Small crystals of aluminium hydroxide are collected to serve
as seeding agents; coarse particles are converted to alumina by heating; the excess solution is removed by
evaporation, (if needed) purified, and recycled.[131]
Hall–Héroult process
 The conversion of alumina to aluminium metal is achieved by the Hall–
Héroult process. In this energy-intensive process, a solution of alumina in a
molten (950 and 980 °C (1,740 and 1,800 °F)) mixture of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryolite"] cryolite
(Na3AlF6) with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_fluoride"] calcium fluoride is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis"] electrolyzed to produce metallic
aluminium. The liquid aluminium metal sinks to the bottom of the solution
and is tapped off, and usually cast into large blocks called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_stock"] aluminium billets
for further processing.[37]
Anodes of the electrolysis cell are made of carbon—the most resistant [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusion"] Extrusion billets of
material against fluoride corrosion—and either bake at the process or are aluminium
prebaked. The former, also called Söderberg anodes, are less power-
efficient and fumes released during baking are costly to collect, which is
why they are being replaced by prebaked anodes even though they save the power, energy, and labor to
prebake the cathodes. Carbon for anodes should be preferably pure so that neither aluminium nor the
electrolyte is contaminated with ash. Despite carbon's resistivity against corrosion, it is still consumed at a
rate of 0.4–0.5 kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium. Cathodes are made of anthracite; high purity
for them is not required because impurities [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaching_(chemistry)"] leach only very slowly. The cathode is consumed at a rate of
0.02–0.04 kg per each kilogram of produced aluminium. A cell is usually terminated after 2–6 years
following a failure of the cathode.[37]
The Hall–Heroult process produces aluminium with a purity of above 99%. Further purification can be
done by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoopes_process"] Hoopes process. This process involves the electrolysis of molten aluminium with a sodium,
barium, and aluminium fluoride electrolyte. The resulting aluminium has a purity of 99.99%.[37][132]
Electric power represents about 20 to 40% of the cost of producing aluminium, depending on the location
of the smelter. Aluminium production consumes roughly 5% of electricity generated in the United
States.[125] Because of this, alternatives to the Hall–Héroult process have been researched, but none has
turned out to be economically feasible.[37]
Recycling
Recovery of the metal through [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling"] recycling has become an important task of the aluminium industry.
 Recycling was a low-profile activity until the late 1960s, when the growing use of aluminium beverage
cans brought it to public awareness.[133] Recycling involves melting the scrap, a process that requires only
5% of the energy used to produce aluminium from ore, though a significant part (up to 15% of the input

with values reported below 1%.[135]

White dross from primary aluminium production and from
secondary recycling operations still contains useful quantities of
aluminium that can be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_dross_recycling"] extracted industrially. The process produces
aluminium billets, together with a highly complex waste material.
This waste is difficult to manage. It reacts with water, releasing a
mixture of gases (including, among others, hydrogen, acetylene,
and ammonia),  which spontaneously ignites on contact with
air;[136] contact with damp air results in the release of copious
quantities of ammonia gas. Despite these difficulties, the waste is
used as a filler in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphalt"] asphalt and concrete.[137]

Applications
Metal
The global production of aluminium in 2016 was 58.8 million
metric tons. It exceeded that of any other metal except [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"] iron
(1,231 million metric tons).[138][139]
Aluminium is almost always alloyed, which markedly improves its
mechanical properties, especially when tempered. For example, the
common [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_foil"] aluminium foils and beverage cans are alloys of 92% to
99% aluminium.[140] The main [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloying"] alloying agents are copper, zinc, 
Aluminium-bodied [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_A40_Sports"] Austin A40 Sports
(c. 1951)
magnesium, manganese, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon"] silicon (e.g., duralumin) with the levels of other metals in a few percent by
weight.[141] Aluminium, both wrought and cast, has been alloyed with: manganese, silicon, magnesium,
 copper and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"] zinc among others.[142] For example, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kynal"] Kynal family of alloys was developed by the British
chemical manufacturer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Chemical_Industries"] Imperial Chemical Industries.
The major uses for aluminium metal are in:[143]
Transportation (automobiles, aircraft, trucks, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railway_car"] railway cars,
marine vessels, bicycles, spacecraft, etc.). Aluminium is
used because of its low density;
Packaging (cans, foil, frame, etc.). Aluminium is used
because it is non-toxic (see below), non-adsorptive, and
splinter-proof;
Building and construction (windows, doors, siding,
building wire, sheathing, roofing, etc.). Since steel is
cheaper, aluminium is used when lightness, corrosion
resistance, or engineering features are important; 
 Aluminium can
Electricity-related uses (conductor alloys, motors, and generators, transformers, capacitors,
etc.). Aluminium is used because it is relatively cheap, highly conductive, has adequate
mechanical strength and low density, and resists corrosion;
A wide range of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household"] household items, from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_utensil"] cooking utensils to furniture. Low density, good
appearance, ease of fabrication, and durability are the key factors of aluminium usage;
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zinc"]
Page 15
Machinery and equipment (processing equipment, pipes, tools). Aluminium is used because
of its corrosion resistance, non-pyrophoricity, and mechanical strength.
Portable computer cases. Currently rarely used without alloying,[144] but aluminium can be
 recycled and clean aluminium has residual market value: for example, the used beverage
can (UBC) material was used to encase the electronic components of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air"] MacBook Air laptop,
 Pixel 5 smartphone or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montblanc_(company)"] Summit Lite smartwatch.[145][146][147]
Compounds
The great majority (about 90%) of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_oxide"] aluminium oxide is converted to metallic aluminium.[131] Being a very
hard material ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_hardness"] Mohs hardness 9),[148] alumina is widely used as an abrasive;[149] being extraordinarily
chemically inert, it is useful in highly reactive environments such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_pressure_sodium"] high pressure sodium lamps.[150]
Aluminium oxide is commonly used as a catalyst for industrial processes;[131] e.g. the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claus_process"] Claus process to
convert [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide"] hydrogen sulfide to sulfur in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refineries"] refineries and to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkylation"] alkylate amines.[151][152] Many industrial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis"] catalysts
are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalyst_support"] supported by alumina, meaning that the expensive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalysis"] catalyst material is dispersed over a surface of the
inert alumina.[153] Another principal use is as a drying agent or absorbent.[131][154]
Several sulfates of aluminium have industrial and commercial application.
 Aluminium sulfate (in its hydrate form) is produced on the annual scale of
 several millions of metric tons.[155] About two-thirds is consumed in water
treatment.[155] The next major application is in the manufacture of
paper.[155] It is also used as a mordant in dyeing, in pickling seeds,
deodorizing of mineral oils, in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanning_(leather)"] leather tanning, and in production of other
aluminium compounds.[155] Two kinds of alum, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonium_alum"] ammonium alum and
 potassium alum, were formerly used as mordants and in leather tanning, but
their use has significantly declined following availability of high-purity
aluminium sulfate.[155] Anhydrous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_chloride"] aluminium chloride is used as a catalyst
in chemical and petrochemical industries, the dyeing industry, and in
synthesis of various inorganic and organic compounds.[155] Aluminium
hydroxychlorides are used in purifying water, in the paper industry, and as
antiperspirants.[155] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_aluminate"] Sodium aluminate is used in treating water and as an
accelerator of solidification of cement.[155]
Many aluminium compounds have niche applications, for example: 
Laser deposition of alumina
on a substrate
 Aluminium acetate in solution is used as an astringent.[156]
 Aluminium phosphate is used in the manufacture of glass, ceramic, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_pulp"] pulp and paper
products, cosmetics, paints, varnishes, and in dental cement.[157]
 Aluminium hydroxide is used as an antacid, and mordant; it is used also in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water"] water
purification, the manufacture of glass and ceramics, and in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterproofing"] waterproofing of
fabrics.[158][159]
 Lithium aluminium hydride is a powerful reducing agent used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_chemistry"] organic chemistry.[160][161]
 Organoaluminiums are used as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_acid"] Lewis acids and co-catalysts.[162]
 Methylaluminoxane is a co-catalyst for Ziegler–Natta olefin polymerization to produce vinyl
polymers such as polyethene.[163]
Aqueous aluminium ions (such as aqueous aluminium sulfate) are used to treat against fish
parasites such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrodactylus_salaris"] Gyrodactylus salaris.[164]
In many vaccines, certain aluminium salts serve as an immune [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunologic_adjuvant"] adjuvant (immune response
booster) to allow the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein"] protein in the vaccine to achieve sufficient potency as an immune
Page 16
stimulant.[165]
Biology
Despite its widespread occurrence in the Earth's crust,
aluminium has no known function in biology.[37] At pH
6–9 (relevant for most natural waters),  aluminium
precipitates out of water as the hydroxide and is hence
not available; most elements behaving this way have no
biological role or are toxic.[167] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_sulfate"] Aluminium sulfate has
an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose"] LD50 of 6207 mg/kg (oral, mouse),  which
corresponds to 435 grams for an 70 kg (150 lb)
person.[37]
Toxicity
Aluminium is classified as a non-carcinogen by the
 United States Department of Health and Human
Services.[168][m] A review published in 1988 said that 
Schematic of aluminium absorption by human
skin.[166]
there was little evidence that normal exposure to
aluminium presents a risk to healthy adult,[171] and a 2014 multi-element toxicology review was unable to
 find deleterious effects of aluminium consumed in amounts not greater than 40 mg/day per kg of body
mass.[168] Most aluminium consumed will leave the body in feces; most of the small part of it that enters
the bloodstream, will be excreted via urine;[172] nevertheless some aluminium does pass the blood-brain
barrier and is lodged preferentially in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.[173][174] Evidence published in
1989 indicates that, for Alzheimer's patients, aluminium may act by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrostatically"] electrostatically [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosslink"] crosslinking proteins,
thus down-regulating genes in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_temporal_gyrus"] superior temporal gyrus.[175]
Effects
 Aluminium, although rarely, can cause vitamin D-resistant osteomalacia, erythropoietin-resistant microcytic
anemia, and central nervous system alterations. People with kidney insufficiency are especially at a
risk.[168] Chronic ingestion of hydrated aluminium silicates (for excess gastric acidity control) may result in
aluminium binding to intestinal contents and increased elimination of other metals, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"] iron or zinc;
sufficiently high doses (>50 g/day) can cause anemia.[168]
During the 1988 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelford_water_pollution_incident"] Camelford water pollution incident people in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelford"] Camelford had their drinking water
contaminated with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_sulfate"] aluminium sulfate for several weeks. A final report into the incident in 2013 concluded it
was unlikely that this had caused long-term health problems.[176]
Aluminium has been suspected of being a possible cause of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease"] Alzheimer's disease,[177] but research into this
for over 40 years has found, as of 2018, no good evidence of causal effect.[178][179]
Aluminium increases estrogen-related [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression"] gene expression in human [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer"] breast cancer cells cultured in the
laboratory.[180] In very high doses, aluminium is associated with altered function of the blood–brain
barrier.[181] A small percentage of people[182] have contact [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy"] allergies to aluminium and experience itchy red
rashes, headache, muscle pain, joint pain, poor memory, insomnia, depression, asthma, irritable bowel
syndrome, or other symptoms upon contact with products containing aluminium.[183]
Page 17
Exposure to powdered aluminium or aluminium
welding fumes can cause [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonary_fibrosis"] pulmonary fibrosis.[184] Fine
aluminium powder can ignite or explode, posing another
workplace hazard.[185][186]
Exposure routes
Food is the main source of aluminium. Drinking water
contains more aluminium than solid food;[168] however,
aluminium in food may be absorbed more than
aluminium from water.[187] Major sources of human
oral exposure to aluminium include food (due to its use
in food additives, food and beverage packaging, and
cooking utensils),  drinking water (due to its use in
municipal water treatment), and aluminium-containing
medications (particularly antacid/antiulcer and buffered
aspirin formulations).[188] Dietary exposure in
Europeans averages to 0.2–1.5 mg/kg/week but can be
as high as 2.3 mg/kg/week.[168] Higher exposure levels
of aluminium are mostly limited to miners, aluminium
production workers, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialysis"] dialysis patients.[189] 
There are five major aluminium forms absorbed
by human body: the free solvated trivalent cation
(Al3+
(aq)); low-molecular-weight, neutral, soluble
complexes (LMW-Al0(
aq)); high-molecular-weight,
neutral, soluble complexes (HMW-Al0(
aq)); low-
molecular-weight, charged, soluble complexes
(LMW-Al(L)n+
/−(
aq)); nano and micro-particulates
(Al(L)n(s)). They are transported across cell
membranes or cell epi-/[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothelia"] endothelia through five
major routes: (1) paracellular; (2) transcellular; (3)
 active transport; (4) channels; (5) adsorptive or
receptor-mediated endocytosis.[166]
Consumption of antacids, antiperspirants, vaccines, and
cosmetics provide possible routes of exposure.[190] Consumption of acidic foods or liquids with aluminium
enhances aluminium absorption,[191] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maltol"] maltol has been shown to increase the accumulation of aluminium
in nerve and bone tissues.[192]
Treatment
 In case of suspected sudden intake of a large amount of aluminium, the only treatment is deferoxamine
mesylate which may be given to help eliminate aluminium from the body by chelation.[193][194] However,
this should be applied with caution as this reduces not only aluminium body levels, but also those of other
metals such as copper or iron.[193]
Environmental effects
High levels of aluminium occur near mining sites; small amounts of
aluminium are released to the environment at the coal-fired power
plants or incinerators.[195] Aluminium in the air is washed out by
the rain or normally settles down but small particles of aluminium
remain in the air for a long time.[195]
Acidic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation"] precipitation is the main natural factor to mobilize
aluminium from natural sources[168] and the main reason for the
environmental effects of aluminium;[196] however, the main factor
of presence of aluminium in salt and freshwater are the industrial
processes that also release aluminium into air.[168] 
"[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauxite_tailings"] Bauxite tailings" storage facility in
Stade, Germany. The aluminium
industry generates about 70 million
tons of this waste annually.
Page 18
In water, aluminium acts as a toxiс agent on gill-breathing animals such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish"] fish when the water is acidic, in
which aluminium may precipitate on gills,[197] which causes loss of plasma- and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemolymph"] hemolymph ions leading
to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmoregulation"] osmoregulatory failure.[196] Organic complexes of aluminium may be easily absorbed and interfere with
metabolism in mammals and birds, even though this rarely happens in practice.[196]
Aluminium is primary among the factors that reduce plant growth on acidic soils. Although it is generally
harmless to plant growth in pH-neutral soils, in acid soils the concentration of toxic Al3+ [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cation"] cations increases
and disturbs root growth and function.[198][199][200][201] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat"] Wheat has [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation"] developed a tolerance to aluminium,
releasing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_compound"] organic compounds that bind to harmful aluminium cations. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorghum"] Sorghum is believed to have the same
tolerance mechanism.[202]
Aluminium production possesses its own challenges to the environment on each step of the production
process. The major challenge is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions"] greenhouse gas emissions.[189] These gases result from electrical
consumption of the smelters and the byproducts of processing. The most potent of these gases are
 perfluorocarbons from the smelting process.[189] Released [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide"] sulfur dioxide is one of the primary precursors of
 acid rain.[189]
A Spanish scientific report from 2001 claimed that the fungus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geotrichum_candidum"] Geotrichum candidum consumes the
aluminium in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc"] compact discs.[203][204] Other reports all refer back to that report and there is no supporting
original research. Better documented, the bacterium [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa"] Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the fungus
 Cladosporium resinae are commonly detected in aircraft fuel tanks that use kerosene-based fuels (not
avgas), and laboratory cultures can degrade aluminium.[205] However, these life forms do not directly
attack or consume the aluminium; rather, the metal is corroded by microbe waste products.[206]

Notes
a. Davy's 1812 written usage of the word aluminum was predated by other authors' usage of
aluminium. However, Davy is often mentioned as the person who named the element; he
was the first to coin a name for aluminium: he used alumium in 1808. Other authors did not
accept that name, choosing aluminium instead. See below for more details.
b. No elements with odd atomic numbers have more than two stable isotopes; even-numbered
elements have multiple stable isotopes, with tin (element 50) having the highest number of
stable isotopes of all elements, ten. The single exception is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beryllium"] beryllium which is even-
numbered but has only one stable isotope.[5] See [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_and_odd_atomic_nuclei"] Even and odd atomic nuclei for more
details.
c. Most other metals have greater standard atomic weights: for instance, that of iron is 55.8;
copper 63.5; lead 207.2.[7] which has consequences for the element's properties (see
below)
Page 19
d. In fact, aluminium's electropositive behavior, high affinity for oxygen, and highly negative
 standard electrode potential are all better aligned with those of scandium, yttrium,
lanthanum, and actinium, which like aluminium have three valence electrons outside a
noble gas core; this series shows continuous trends whereas those of group 13 is broken by
the first added d-subshell in gallium and the resulting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-block_contraction"] d-block contraction and the first added
f-subshell in thallium and the resulting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanthanide_contraction"] lanthanide contraction.[30]
e. These should not be considered as [AlF6]3− complex anions as the Al–F bonds are not
significantly different in type from the other M–F bonds.[40]
f. Such differences in coordination between the fluorides and heavier halides are not unusual,
occurring in SnIV and BiIII, for example; even bigger differences occur between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"] CO2 and
 SiO2.[40]
g. Abundances in the source are listed relative to silicon rather than in per-particle notation.
The sum of all elements per 106 parts of silicon is 2.6682 ×1010 parts; aluminium comprises
8.410 ×104 parts.
h. Compare annual statistics of aluminium[93] and copper[94] production by USGS.
i. The spelling alumine comes from French, whereas the spelling alumina comes from
Latin.[108]
j. Davy discovered several other elements, including those he named [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium"] sodium and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium"] potassium,
after the English words [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_lime"] soda and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potash"] potash. Berzelius referred to them as to natrium and
kalium. Berzelius's suggestion was expanded in 1814[115] with his proposed system of one
or two-letter [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_symbol"] chemical symbols, which are used up to the present day; sodium and potassium
have the symbols Na and K, respectively, after their Latin names.
k. Some European languages, like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"] Spanish or Italian, use a different suffix from the Latin -um/-
ium to form a name of a metal, some, like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_language"] Polish or Czech, have a different base for the
name of the element, and some, like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language"] Russian or Greek, don't use the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_script"] Latin script altogether.
l. For instance, see the November–December 2013 issue of Chemistry International: in a table
of (some) elements, the element is listed as "aluminium (aluminum)".[127]
m. While aluminium per se is not carcinogenic, Söderberg aluminium production is, as is noted
by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Agency_for_Research_on_Cancer"] International Agency for Research on Cancer,[169] likely due to exposure to polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons.[170]

Potassium, acting upon alumine and glucine, produces pyrophoric substances of
a dark grey colour, which burnt, throwing off brilliant sparks, and leaving behind
alkali and earth, and which, when thrown into water, decomposed it with great
violence. The result of this experiment is not wholly decisive as to the existence
of what might be called aluminium and glucinium

aluminium n. coexisted with its synonym aluminum n. throughout the 19th cent. From
the beginning of the 20th cent., aluminum gradually became the predominant
form in North America; it was adopted as the official name of the metal in the
United States by the American Chemical Society in 1925. Elsewhere, aluminum
was gradually superseded by aluminium, which was accepted as international
standard by IUPAC in 1990.
