In July 2014, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Pictures"] Universal Pictures announced its plan to reboot the "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Classic_Monsters"] Classic Monsters" franchise and its
properties, including the character of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Dracula"] Count Dracula, as part of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_universe"] shared universe known as the Dark
Universe, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Kurtzman"] Alex Kurtzman and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Morgan_(filmmaker)"] Chris Morgan attached to oversee its development.[2] After the release
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula_Untold"] Dracula Untold (2014), its connections to the shared universe were downplayed, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mummy_(2017_film)"] The Mummy
(2017) was re-positioned as the first film in the series.[3][4] In 2017, The Mummy was released, but was
deemed both a commercial and critical failure, resulting in Universal's decision to shift its focus on
individual storytelling and move away from the shared universe concept.[5]
In November 2019, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_Fletcher"] Dexter Fletcher was hired to direct Renfield for
Universal and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skybound_Entertainment"] Skybound Entertainment. Written by Ryan Ridley, it is based
on an original pitch by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kirkman"] Robert Kirkman. The film was described as a
 comedic approach to the world of Count Dracula, with similarities to Taika
Waititi's vampire mockumentary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_We_Do_in_the_Shadows"] What We Do in the Shadows and a major
 focus on the titular character.[6][7] In 2020, Leigh Whannell's The Invisible
Man became a commercial and critical success for Universal and served as
a relaunch to its monster universe.[8] In April 2021, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_McKay"] Chris McKay entered
negotiations to serve as director, after Fletcher left to work on a reboot of
 The Saint for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures"] Paramount Pictures. McKay was hired because he reportedly
gave a successful pitch combining the story's mix of humor and action,
"something the studio was looking to have more of".[9] 
Renfield is based on an
original pitch by comic book
writer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kirkman"] Robert Kirkman.
"We're doing this cool movie for Universal that's a focus on Renfield. It's a story about him
being Dracula's henchman and how shitty a job that is. It's a fun, extremely violent comedy
because I've got a crutch, and it's violence." — Robert Kirkman[10]
Casting
 Nicholas Hoult was cast in
the title role in August
2021.[11] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage"] Nicolas Cage was
cast to play Count Dracula
in  November,[12]
 Awkwafina and Ben
Schwartz were added to the
cast in December,[13][14]
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Martinez_(actor)"] Adrian Martinez,[1]
 Shohreh Aghdashloo,[15] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Hoult"] Nicholas Hoult and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage"] Nicolas Cage play [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renfield"] Renfield and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Dracula"] Count Dracula, respectively.
 Bess Rous,[16] and James
Moses Black were confirmed to star early in the new year.[17] An "enormous" fan of Dracula and the
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dracula"] original 1897 novel, Cage prepared for his role by observing the distinctive ways Dracula was portrayed on
screen by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bela_Lugosi"] Bela Lugosi, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Langella"] Frank Langella, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman"] Gary Oldman. "What can I bring that will be different?", he
Page 3
added, "I want it to pop in a unique way. We've seen it played well, we've seen it play not so well, so what
can we do? So I'm thinking to really focus on the movement of the character ... [and] that perfect tone of
comedy and horror". Cage mentioned [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_American_Werewolf_in_London"] An American Werewolf in London (1981),  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_(film)"] Ringu (1998),  and
 Malignant (2021) as inspirations for the role.[18][19][20] The film will mark Cage's first live-action film by a
major studio since starring in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Rider:_Spirit_of_Vengeance"] Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (2011).[21] In May, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Scott_Jones"] Brandon Scott Jones
was revealed as part of the cast.[22]
Filming
Filming began in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans"] New Orleans on February 3, 2022, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Amundsen"] Mitchell Amundsen serving as
cinematographer.[23][24] On February 8, more than twenty vehicles belonging to the production crew were
burglarized.[25] One security guard was present at the time of the incident, which occurred late at night in a
secured parking lot. Crew member Elmo Peoples said the vandals had stolen his insurance papers, two
bank cards, and a laptop. He added, "I'm supposed to be here all week and I don't even want to come back
because I feel like they don't really care about us as much as the main characters or actors." Love Bugs
Film LLC reassured the production crew that they would hire additional security.[26] Filming wrapped on
April 14, 2022, exactly one year prior to the film's release.[27]
Release
The film is scheduled to be released in theaters on April 14, 2023, by Universal Pictures.[28]
