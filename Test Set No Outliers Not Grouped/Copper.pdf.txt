Copper
Copper is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"] chemical element with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_(chemistry)"] symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and
 atomic number 29. It is a soft, malleable, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ductility"] ductile metal with very high
 thermal and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductivity"] electrical conductivity. A freshly exposed surface of pure copper
has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_(color)"] pinkish-orange color. Copper is used as a conductor of heat and
electricity, as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_material#Metal"] building material, and as a constituent of various metal alloys,
such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_silver"] sterling silver used in jewelry, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupronickel"] cupronickel used to make marine
hardware and coins, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantan"] constantan used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strain_gauge"] strain gauges and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouples"] thermocouples
for temperature measurement.

Cu
Copper is one of the few metals that can occur in nature in a directly usable
metallic form ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_metal"] native metals). This led to very early human use in several
regions, from circa 8000 BC. Thousands of years later, it was the first metal to
be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelting"] smelted from sulfide ores, circa 5000 BC; the first metal to be cast into a
shape in a mold, c. 4000 BC; and the first metal to be purposely alloyed with
another metal, tin, to create bronze, c. 3500 BC.[5]
In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome"] Roman era, copper was mined principally on Cyprus, the origin of the
name of the metal, from aes сyprium (metal of Cyprus), later corrupted to
сuprum (Latin). Coper ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English"] Old English) and copper were derived from this, the
later spelling first used around 1530.[6]

Commonly encountered compounds are copper(II) salts, which often impart
blue or green colors to such minerals as azurite, malachite, and turquoise, and
have been used widely and historically as pigments.
Copper used in buildings, usually for roofing, oxidizes to form a green
 verdigris (or patina). Copper is sometimes used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorative_art"] decorative art, both in its
elemental metal form and in compounds as pigments. Copper compounds are
used as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriostatic_agent"] bacteriostatic agents, fungicides, and wood preservatives.
Copper is essential to all living organisms as a trace [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_mineral"] dietary mineral because it
is a key constituent of the respiratory enzyme complex [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_c_oxidase"] cytochrome c oxidase.
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molluscs"] molluscs and crustaceans, copper is a constituent of the blood pigment
hemocyanin, replaced by the iron-complexed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemoglobin"] hemoglobin in fish and other
vertebrates. In humans, copper is found mainly in the liver, muscle, and
bone.[7] The adult body contains between 1.4 and 2.1 mg of copper per
kilogram of body weight.[8]

Copper, silver, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold"] gold are in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_11_element"] group 11 of the
periodic table; these three metals have one s-
orbital electron on top of a filled d-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_shell"] electron shell
and are characterized by high ductility, and
electrical and thermal conductivity. The filled d-
shells in these elements contribute little to
interatomic interactions, which are dominated by

the s-electrons through [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_bond"] metallic bonds. Unlike
metals with incomplete d-shells, metallic bonds in
copper are lacking a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond"] covalent character and are
relatively weak. This observation explains the low
 hardness and high ductility of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocrystalline"] single crystals of
copper.[9] At the macroscopic scale, introduction
of extended defects to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_lattice"] crystal lattice, such as
grain boundaries, hinders flow of the material under applied stress, thereby
increasing its hardness. For this reason, copper is usually supplied in a fine-
grained [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycrystalline"] polycrystalline form, which has greater strength than monocrystalline
forms.[10]
The softness of copper partly explains its high electrical conductivity
(59.6×106 S/m) and high thermal conductivity, second highest (second only to
silver) among pure metals at room temperature.[11] This is because the
resistivity to electron transport in metals at room temperature originates
primarily from scattering of electrons on thermal vibrations of the lattice,
which are relatively weak in a soft metal.[9] The maximum permissible current

natural color other than gray or silver.[13] Pure
copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarnish"] tarnish when exposed to air. The characteristic color of copper
results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells – the energy
difference between these shells corresponds to orange light.
As with other metals, if copper is put in contact with another metal, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_corrosion"] galvanic corrosion will occur.[14]
Chemical
Copper does not react with water, but it does slowly react with
atmospheric oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide
which, unlike the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust"] rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the
underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdigris"] verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper
structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings[15] and the
 Statue of Liberty.[16] Copper [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarnish"] tarnishes when exposed to some

62Cu and 64Cu have significant applications. 62Cu is used in 62Cu-PTSM as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_tracer"] radioactive tracer for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography"] positron emission tomography.[20]
Occurrence
Copper is produced in massive stars[21] and is present in the Earth's crust in a proportion of about 50 parts
per million (ppm).[22] In nature, copper occurs in a variety of minerals, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_copper"] native copper, copper
sulfides such as chalcopyrite, bornite, digenite, covellite, and chalcocite, copper [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfosalt_minerals"] sulfosalts such as
 tetrahedite-tennantite, and enargite, copper carbonates such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azurite"] azurite and malachite, and as copper(I) or
copper(II) oxides such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuprite"] cuprite and tenorite, respectively.[11] The largest mass of elemental copper
discovered weighed 420 tonnes and was found in 1857 on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keweenaw_Peninsula"] Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan, US.[22]
Native copper is a polycrystal, with the largest single crystal ever described measuring 4.4×3.2×3.2 cm.[23]
Copper is the 25th most abundant element in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_crust"] Earth's crust, representing 50 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_per_million"] ppm compared with 75 ppm for
zinc, and 14 ppm for lead.[24]
Typical background concentrations of copper do not exceed 1 ng/m3 in the atmosphere; 150 mg/kg in soil;
30 mg/kg in vegetation; 2 μg/L in freshwater and 0.5 μg/L in seawater.[25]

Production
Most copper is mined or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_extraction_techniques"] extracted as copper sulfides from large [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_pit_mine"] open pit mines in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyry_copper"] porphyry copper deposits that contain 0.4 to 1.0%
copper. Sites include Chuquicamata, in Chile, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingham_Canyon_Mine"] Bingham Canyon Mine, in Utah, United States, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Chino_Mine"] El Chino Mine, in New Mexico,
United States. According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Geological_Survey"] British Geological Survey, in 2005, Chile was the top producer of copper with at least one-third of the
world share followed by the United States, Indonesia and Peru.[11] Copper can also be recovered through the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-situ_leach"] in-situ leach process.
Several sites in the state of Arizona are considered prime candidates for this method.[26] The amount of copper in use is increasing and
the quantity available is barely sufficient to allow all countries to reach developed world levels of usage.[27] An alternative source of
copper for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea_mining"] collection currently being researched are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymetallic_nodules"] polymetallic nodules, which are located at the depths of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean"] Pacific Ocean
approximately 3000–6500 meters below sea level. These nodules contain other valuable metals such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt"] cobalt and nickel.[28]

Reserves and prices
Copper has been in use at least 10,000 years, but more
than 95% of all copper ever mined and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelting"] smelted has been
extracted since 1900.[29] As with many natural
resources, the total amount of copper on Earth is vast,
with around 1014 tons in the top kilometer of Earth's
Chuquicamata, in Chile, is one of the
world's largest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-pit_mining"] open pit copper [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining"] mines 
crust, which is about 5 million years' worth at the current
rate of extraction. However, only a tiny fraction of these
reserves is economically viable with present-day prices
and technologies. Estimates of copper reserves available
for mining vary from 25 to 60 years, depending on core
assumptions such as the growth rate.[30] Recycling is a major source of copper in the modern
world.[29] Because of these and other factors, the future of copper production and supply is the
subject of much debate, including the concept of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_copper"] peak copper, analogous to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil"] peak oil. 
World production trend
The price of copper has historically been unstable,[31] and its price increased from the 60-year
low of US$0.60/lb (US$1.32/kg) in June 1999 to $3.75 per pound ($8.27/kg) in May 2006. It
dropped to $2.40/lb ($5.29/kg) in February 2007, then rebounded to $3.50/lb ($7.71/kg) in April 
Copper prices 2003–2011 in US$ per
tonne
2007.[32] In February 2009, weakening global demand and a steep fall in commodity prices
since the previous year's highs left copper prices at $1.51/lb ($3.32/kg).[33] Between September 2010 and February 2011, the price of
copper rose from £5,000 a metric ton to £6,250 a metric ton.[34]
Methods 
The concentration of copper in ores averages only 0.6%, and most commercial ores are sulfides,
especially chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), bornite (Cu5FeS4) and, to a lesser extent, covellite (CuS) and
chalcocite (Cu2S).[35] Conversely, the average concentration of copper in polymetallic nodules
is estimated at 1.3%. The methods of extracting copper as well as other metals found in these
nodules include sulphuric leaching, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelting"] smelting and an application of the Cuprion process.[36][37]
For minerals found in land ores, they are concentrated from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comminution"] crushed ores to the level of 10–15%
copper by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Froth_flotation"] froth flotation or bioleaching.[38] Heating this material with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silica"] silica in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_smelting"] flash smelting
removes much of the iron as slag. The process exploits the greater ease of converting iron
sulfides into oxides, which in turn react with the silica to form the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicate"] silicate slag that floats on top
of the heated mass. The resulting copper matte, consisting of Cu2S, is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roasting_(metallurgy)"] roasted to convert the
sulfides into oxides:[35]
2 Cu2S + 3 O2 → 2 Cu2O + 2 SO2
The cuprous oxide reacts with cuprous sulfide to converted to blister copper upon heating:
Scheme of flash smelting process 
2 Cu2O + Cu2S → 6 Cu + 2 SO2
The Sudbury [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matte_(metallurgy)"] matte process converted only half the sulfide to oxide and then used this oxide to
remove the rest of the sulfur as oxide. It was then electrolytically refined and the anode mud
exploited for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum"] platinum and gold it contained. This step exploits the relatively easy reduction of copper oxides to copper metal.
 Natural gas is blown across the blister to remove most of the remaining oxygen and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrorefining"] electrorefining is performed on the resulting material
to produce pure copper:[39]

Recycling
Like aluminium,[40] copper is recyclable without any loss of quality, both from raw state and from manufactured products.[41] In
volume, copper is the third most recycled metal after iron and aluminium.[42] An estimated 80% of all copper ever mined is still in use
today.[43] According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Resource_Panel"] International Resource Panel's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Stocks_in_Society_report"] Metal Stocks in Society report, the global per capita stock of copper in use in
society is 35–55 kg. Much of this is in more-developed countries (140–300 kg per capita) rather than less-developed countries (30–
40 kg per capita).
The process of recycling copper is roughly the same as is used to extract copper but requires fewer steps. High-purity scrap copper is
 melted in a furnace and then reduced and cast into billets and ingots; lower-purity scrap is refined by electroplating in a bath of sulfuric
acid.[44]
Alloys
Numerous copper [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy"] alloys have been formulated, many with important uses. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass"] Brass is an alloy of
copper and zinc. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze"] Bronze usually refers to copper-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin"] tin alloys, but can refer to any alloy of copper
such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium_bronze"] aluminium bronze. Copper is one of the most important constituents of silver and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fineness"] karat
gold solders used in the jewelry industry, modifying the color, hardness and melting point of the
resulting alloys.[47] Some lead-free [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solder#Solder_alloys"] solders consist of tin alloyed with a small proportion of
copper and other metals.[48]
The alloy of copper and nickel, called cupronickel, is used in low-denomination coins, often for
the outer cladding. The US five-cent coin (currently called a nickel) consists of 75% copper and
25% nickel in homogeneous composition. Prior to the introduction of cupronickel, which was
widely adopted by countries in the latter half of the 20th century,[49] alloys of copper and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver"] silver
were also used, with the United States using an alloy of 90% silver and 10% copper until 1965,
when circulating silver was removed from all coins with the exception of the Half dollar - these
were debased to an alloy of 40% silver and 60% copper between 1965 and 1970.[50] The alloy
of 90% copper and 10% nickel, remarkable for its resistance to corrosion, is used for various
objects exposed to seawater, though it is vulnerable to the sulfides sometimes found in polluted
harbors and estuaries.[51] Alloys of copper with aluminium (about 7%) have a golden color and
are used in decorations.[22] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakud%C5%8D"] Shakudō is a Japanese decorative alloy of copper containing a low
percentage of gold, typically 4–10%, that can be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patina"] patinated to a dark blue or black color.[52] 
Copper alloys are widely used in the
production of coinage; seen here are
two examples - post-1964 American
dimes, which are composed of the
alloy [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupronickel"] cupronickel[45] and a pre-1968
 Canadian dime, which is composed
of an alloy of 80 percent silver and
20 percent copper.[46]

Compounds
Copper forms a rich variety of compounds, usually with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidation_state"] oxidation states +1 and +2, which are
often called cuprous and cupric,  respectively.[53] Copper compounds, whether organic
 complexes or organometallics, promote or catalyse numerous chemical and biological
processes.[54]
Binary compounds
As with other elements, the simplest compounds of copper are binary compounds, i.e. those
containing only two elements, the principal examples being oxides, sulfides, and halides. Both
 cuprous and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper(II)_oxide"] cupric oxides are known. Among the numerous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_sulfide"] copper sulfides, important
examples include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper(I)_sulfide"] copper(I) sulfide and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_monosulfide"] copper(II) sulfide.
Cuprous halides with fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper(I)_iodide"] iodine are known, as are cupric halides
with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. Attempts to prepare copper(II) iodide yield only copper(I)
iodide and iodine.[53]
2 Cu2+ + 4 I− → 2 CuI + I2 
A sample of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper(I)_oxide"] copper(I) oxide.
Coordination chemistry 
Copper forms [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_complex"] coordination complexes with ligands. In aqueous solution, copper(II) exists as
[Cu(H2O)6]2+
. This complex exhibits the fastest water exchange rate (speed of water ligands
 attaching and detaching) for any transition metal aquo complex. Adding aqueous sodium
hydroxide causes the precipitation of light blue solid [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper(II)_hydroxide"] copper(II) hydroxide. A simplified equation is:
Cu2+ + 2 OH− → Cu(OH)2
 Aqueous ammonia results in the same precipitate. Upon
adding excess ammonia, the precipitate dissolves, forming
 tetraamminecopper(II):
Copper(II) gives a deep blue
coloration in the presence of
ammonia ligands. The one used
 here is tetraamminecopper(II) 
Cu(H2O)4(OH)2 + 4 NH3 → [Cu(H2O)2(NH3)4]2++ 2

sulfate.  Many other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyanion"] oxyanions form complexes; these include

Polyols, compounds containing more than one alcohol [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_group"] functional group, generally interact with
cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reducing_sugars"] reducing sugars. Specifically, using
 Benedict's reagent and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fehling%27s_solution"] Fehling's solution the presence of the sugar is signaled by a color change
from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide.[56] Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with
 ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose.[57] Amino acids form very stable chelate
complexes with copper(II).[58][59][60] Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist, one involving
 potassium ferrocyanide, which gives a brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.

Copper(III) and copper(IV)
Copper(III) is most often found in oxides. A simple example is potassium cuprate, KCuO2, a blue-black solid.[67] The most extensively
studied copper(III) compounds are the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuprate_superconductor"] cuprate superconductors. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yttrium_barium_copper_oxide"] Yttrium barium copper oxide (YBa2Cu3O7) consists of both Cu(II) and
Cu(III) centres. Like oxide, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride"] fluoride is a highly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_(chemistry)"] basic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anion"] anion[68] and is known to stabilize metal ions in high oxidation states. Both
copper(III) and even copper(IV) fluorides are known, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_hexafluorocuprate(III)"] K3CuF6 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium_hexafluorocuprate(IV)"] Cs2CuF6, respectively.[53]
Some copper proteins form [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxo_complex"] oxo complexes, which also feature copper(III).[69] With tetrapeptides, purple-colored copper(III) complexes
are stabilized by the deprotonated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amide"] amide ligands.[70]
 Complexes of copper(III) are also found as intermediates in reactions of organocopper compounds.[71] For example, in the Kharasch–
Sosnovsky reaction.
History
A timeline of copper illustrates how this metal has advanced human civilization for the past 11,000 years.[72]
Prehistoric
Copper Age
A corroded copper [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingot"] ingot from Zakros,
Crete, shaped in the form of an
animal skin (oxhide) typical in that
era. 
Copper occurs naturally as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_copper"] native metallic copper and
was known to some of the oldest civilizations on record.
The history of copper use dates to 9000 BC in the
Middle East;[73] a copper pendant was found in northern
Iraq that dates to 8700 BC.[74] Evidence suggests that
gold and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteoric_iron"] meteoric iron (but not smelted iron) were the
only metals used by humans before copper.[75] The
history of copper metallurgy is thought to follow this
sequence: First, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_forming"] cold working of native copper, then
annealing, smelting, and, finally, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost-wax_casting"] lost-wax casting. In
southeastern Anatolia, all four of these techniques
appear more or less simultaneously at the beginning of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic"] Neolithic c. 7500 BC.[76]
Copper smelting was independently invented in different
places. It was probably discovered in China before 2800
BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West
 Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD.[77] Investment
casting was invented in 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Many tools during the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcolithic"] Chalcolithic
Asia[73] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dating"] carbon dating has established mining at

99.7% pure; high levels of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic"] arsenic in his hair suggest an involvement in copper smelting.[79]
Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper
smelting led to the discovery of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomery"] iron smelting.[79] Production in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Copper_Complex"] Old Copper Complex in
Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC.[80][81] Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon,
arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.[82]
Bronze Age
Alloying copper with tin to make bronze was first practiced about 4000 years after the discovery of copper smelting, and about 2000
years after "natural bronze" had come into general use.[83] Bronze artifacts from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_culture"] Vinča culture date to 4500 BC.[84] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer"] Sumerian and
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt"] Egyptian artifacts of copper and bronze alloys date to 3000 BC.[85] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age"] Bronze Age began in Southeastern Europe around 3700–3300
BC, in Northwestern Europe about 2500 BC. It ended with the beginning of the Iron Age, 2000–1000 BC in the Near East, and 600
BC in Northern Europe. The transition between the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic"] Neolithic period and the Bronze Age was formerly termed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcolithic"] Chalcolithic period
(copper-stone), when copper tools were used with stone tools. The term has gradually fallen out of favor because in some parts of the
world, the Chalcolithic and Neolithic are coterminous at both ends. Brass, an alloy of copper and zinc, is of much more recent origin. It
was known to the Greeks, but became a significant supplement to bronze during the Roman Empire.[85]

Ancient and post-classical
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alchemy"] alchemy the
symbol for
copper was also
the symbol for
the goddess and
planet Venus. 
In Greece, copper was known by the name chalkos (χαλκός). It was an
important resource for the Romans, Greeks and other ancient peoples. In
Roman times, it was known as aes Cyprium, aes being the generic Latin
term for copper alloys and Cyprium from Cyprus, where much copper was
mined. The phrase was simplified to cuprum, hence the English copper.
 Aphrodite ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_(goddess)"] Venus in Rome) represented copper in mythology and alchemy
because of its lustrous beauty and its ancient use in producing mirrors;
Cyprus, the source of copper, was sacred to the goddess. The seven
heavenly bodies known to the ancients were associated with the seven
metals known in antiquity, and Venus was assigned to copper, both because
of the connection to the goddess and because Venus was the brightest
heavenly body after the Sun and Moon and so corresponded to the most
lustrous and desirable metal after gold and silver.[86] 
 Chalcolithic copper mine in Timna
Valley, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negev_Desert"] Negev Desert, Israel.
Copper was first mined in ancient Britain as early as 2100 BC. Mining at the largest of these mines, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Orme"] Great Orme, continued into the
late Bronze Age. Mining seems to have been largely restricted to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supergene_(geology)"] supergene ores, which were easier to smelt. The rich copper deposits
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwall"] Cornwall seem to have been largely untouched, in spite of extensive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin"] tin mining in the region, for reasons likely social and political
rather than technological.[87]
In North America, copper mining began with marginal workings by Native Americans. Native copper is known to have been extracted
from sites on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_Royale"] Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600.[88] Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America,
particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's
commercial production did not start until the early 20th century.
The cultural role of copper has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps
as money. At first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually the shape and look of the copper became more important. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar"] Julius Caesar
had his own coins made from brass, while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus"] Octavianus Augustus Caesar's coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated
annual output of around 15,000 t, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_metallurgy"] Roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale unsurpassed until the time of the
 Industrial Revolution; the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_province"] provinces most intensely mined were those of Hispania, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus"] Cyprus and in Central Europe.[89][90]
The gates of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Jerusalem"] Temple of Jerusalem used [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corinthian_bronze"] Corinthian bronze treated with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depletion_gilding"] depletion gilding. The process was most prevalent in
Alexandria, where alchemy is thought to have begun.[91] In ancient India, copper was used in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holistic"] holistic medical science [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda"] Ayurveda for
 surgical instruments and other medical equipment. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt"] Ancient Egyptians ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Kingdom"] ~2400 BC) used copper for sterilizing wounds and drinking
water, and later to treat headaches, burns, and itching.
Modern
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Copper_Mountain"] Great Copper Mountain was a mine in Falun, Sweden, that operated from the 10th century
to 1992. It satisfied two-thirds of Europe's copper consumption in the 17th century and helped
fund many of Sweden's wars during that time.[92] It was referred to as the nation's treasury;
Sweden had a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_copper_currency_in_Sweden"] copper backed currency.[93]
Copper is used in roofing,[15] currency, and for photographic technology known as the
 daguerreotype. Copper was used in Renaissance sculpture, and was used to construct the Statue
of Liberty; copper continues to be used in construction of various types. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_plating"] Copper plating and
 copper sheathing were widely used to protect the under-water hulls of ships, a technique
pioneered by the British Admiralty in the 18th century.[94] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norddeutsche_Affinerie"] Norddeutsche Affinerie in
Hamburg was the first modern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroplating"] electroplating plant, starting its production in 1876.[95] The
German scientist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Osann"] Gottfried Osann invented [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powder_metallurgy"] powder metallurgy in 1830 while determining the
metal's atomic mass; around then it was discovered that the amount and type of alloying element
(e.g., tin) to copper would affect bell tones.
During the rise in demand for copper for the Age of Electricity, from the 1880s until the Great Copper Ornaments
Depression of the 1930s, the United States produced one third to half the world's newly mined
copper.[96] Major districts included the Keweenaw district of northern Michigan, primarily
native copper deposits, which was eclipsed by the vast sulphide deposits of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butte,_Montana"] Butte, Montana in the late 1880s, which itself was eclipsed
by porphyry deposits of the Souhwest United States, especially at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingham_Canyon,_Utah"] Bingham Canyon, Utah and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morenci,_Arizona"] Morenci, Arizona. Introduction of open
pit steam shovel mining and innovations in smelting, refining, flotation concentration and other processing steps led to mass production.
Early in the twentieth century, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona"] Arizona ranked first, followed by Montana, then [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah"] Utah and Michigan.[97]
 Flash smelting was developed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outokumpu"] Outokumpu in Finland and first applied at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harjavalta"] Harjavalta in 1949; the energy-efficient process accounts
for 50% of the world's primary copper production.[98]
Page 9
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Council_of_Copper_Exporting_Countries"] Intergovernmental Council of Copper Exporting Countries, formed in 1967 by Chile, Peru,
Zaire and Zambia, operated in the copper market as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPEC"] OPEC does in oil, though it never achieved
the same influence, particularly because the second-largest producer, the United States, was
never a member; it was dissolved in 1988.[99]
Applications
The major applications of copper are electrical wire (60%), roofing and plumbing (20%), and
industrial machinery (15%). Copper is used mostly as a pure metal, but when greater hardness is
required, it is put into such alloys as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass"] brass and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze"] bronze (5% of total use).[22] For more than two
centuries, copper paint has been used on boat hulls to control the growth of plants and
shellfish.[100] A small part of the copper supply is used for nutritional supplements and
fungicides in agriculture.[55][101] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machining"] Machining of copper is possible, although alloys are preferred
for good [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machinability"] machinability in creating intricate parts.
Wire and cable
Despite competition from other materials, copper remains the preferred [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor"] electrical conductor in
nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission"] electric power transmission where
 aluminium is often preferred.[102][103] Copper wire is used in power generation, power
transmission, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_distribution"] power distribution, telecommunications, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"] electronics circuitry, and countless types
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_equipment"] electrical equipment.[104] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_wiring"] Electrical wiring is the most important market for the copper
industry.[105] This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire,
communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper
mined is used for electrical wire and cable conductors.[106] Many electrical devices rely on
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductivity"] copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical
conductivity, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensile_strength"] tensile strength, ductility, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creep_(deformation)"] creep (deformation) resistance, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion"] corrosion resistance, low
 thermal expansion, high [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity"] thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of
installation.
For a short period from the late 1960s to the late 1970s, copper wiring was replaced by
 aluminium wiring in many housing construction projects in America. The new wiring was
implicated in a number of house fires and the industry returned to copper.[107]

Electronics and related devices
 Integrated circuits and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board"] printed circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium
because of its superior electrical conductivity; [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_sink"] heat sinks and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exchanger"] heat exchangers use copper
 because of its superior heat dissipation properties. Electromagnets, vacuum tubes, cathode ray
tubes, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetron"] magnetrons in microwave ovens use copper, as do [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waveguide"] waveguides for microwave
radiation.[108]
Electric motors
Copper's superior [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_wire_and_cable#Electrical_conductivity"] conductivity enhances the efficiency of electrical motors.[109] This is
important because motors and motor-driven systems account for 43%–46% of all global
electricity consumption and 69% of all electricity used by industry.[110] Increasing the mass and

Renewable energy production  Copper fittings for soldered plumbing
joints
 Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, tidal, hydro, biomass, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_energy"] geothermal have
become significant sectors of the energy market.[114][115] The rapid growth of these sources in
 the 21st century has been prompted by increasing costs of fossil fuels as well as their environmental impact issues that significantly
lowered their use.
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications"]
Page 10
Copper plays an important role in these renewable energy systems.[116][117][118][119][120]
Copper usage averages up to five times more in renewable energy systems than in traditional
power generation, such as fossil fuel and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power"] nuclear power plants.[121] Since copper is an excellent
 thermal and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_conductor"] electrical conductor among the engineering metals (second only to silver),[122]
power systems that utilize copper generate and transmit energy with high efficiency and with
minimum environmental impacts.
When choosing electrical conductors, facility planners and engineers factor capital investment
costs of the materials against operational savings due to their electrical energy efficiencies over
their useful lives, plus maintenance costs. Copper often fares well in these calculations. A factor
called "copper usage intensity,” is a measure of the quantity of copper necessary to install one
megawatt of new power-generating capacity.
Copper electrical [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busbar"] busbars distributing
power to a large building 
When planning for a new renewable power facility, engineers and product specifiers seek to
avoid supply shortages of selected materials. According to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Geological_Survey"] United States Geological Survey,
in-ground copper [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_resource_classification"] reserves have increased more than 700% since 1950, from almost 100 million
tonnes to 720 million tonnes in 2017, despite the fact that world refined usage has more than
tripled in the last 50 years.[123] Copper resources are estimated to exceed 5,000 million
tonnes.[124][125]
Bolstering the supply from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_extraction"] copper extraction is the fact that more than 30 percent of copper installed during the last decade came from
recycled sources.[126] Its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling_by_material"] recycling rate is higher than any other metal.[127]
This article discusses the role of copper in various renewable energy generation systems.
Architecture
Copper has been used since ancient times as a durable, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion_resistance"] corrosion resistant, and weatherproof
architectural material.[128][129][130][131] Roofs, flashings, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_gutter"] rain gutters, downspouts, domes,
spires, vaults, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door"] doors have been made from copper for hundreds or thousands of years.
Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior
 wall cladding, building [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_joint"] expansion joints, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RF_shielding"] radio frequency shielding, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_copper-alloy_touch_surfaces"] antimicrobial and
decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops.
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_expansion"] Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal
movement, light weight, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_rod"] lightning protection, and recyclability
The metal's distinctive natural green [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patina"] patina has long been coveted by architects and designers.
The final patina is a particularly durable layer that is highly resistant to atmospheric corrosion,
thereby protecting the underlying metal against further weathering.[132][133][134] It can be a
mixture of carbonate and sulfate compounds in various amounts, depending upon environmental
conditions such as sulfur-containing acid rain.[135][136][137][138] Architectural copper and its
alloys can also be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_in_architecture#Finishes"] 'finished' to take on a particular look, feel, or color. Finishes include
mechanical surface treatments, chemical coloring, and coatings.[139]
Copper has excellent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazing"] brazing and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering"] soldering properties and can be welded; the best results are
obtained with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_metal_arc_welding"] gas metal arc welding.[140] 
 Copper roof on the Minneapolis City
Hall, coated with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patina"] patina
Antibiofouling
Copper is biostatic, meaning bacteria and many other forms of life will not grow on it. For this
reason it has long been used to line parts of ships to protect against [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnacle"] barnacles and mussels. It was
originally used pure, but has since been superseded by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muntz_metal"] Muntz metal and copper-based paint.
Similarly, as discussed in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_alloys_in_aquaculture"] copper alloys in aquaculture, copper alloys have become important
netting materials in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture"] aquaculture industry because they are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"] antimicrobial and prevent
 biofouling, even in extreme conditions[141] and have strong structural and corrosion-
resistant[142] properties in marine environments.

approved the registrations of these copper alloys as "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial"] antimicrobial materials with public health
benefits";[146] that approval allows manufacturers to make legal claims to the public health
benefits of products made of registered alloys. In addition, the EPA has approved a long list of
antimicrobial copper products made from these alloys, such as bedrails, handrails, over-bed
tables, sinks, faucets, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_knobs"] door knobs, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet"] toilet hardware, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_keyboards"] computer keyboards, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_club"] health club equipment,

and in the subway transit system in Santiago, Chile, where copper-zinc alloy handrails were
installed in some 30 stations between 2011 and 2014.[149][150][151]Textile fibers can be blended with copper to create antimicrobial
protective fabrics.[152]
Speculative investing
Copper may be used as a speculative investment due to the predicted increase in use from worldwide infrastructure growth, and the
important role it has in producing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine"] wind turbines, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel"] solar panels, and other renewable energy sources.[153][154] Another reason predicted
demand increases is the fact that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car"] electric cars contain an average of 3.6 times as much copper as conventional cars, although the effect of
 electric cars on copper demand is debated.[155][156] Some people invest in copper through copper mining stocks, ETFs, and futures.
Others store physical copper in the form of copper bars or rounds although these tend to carry a higher premium in comparison to
precious metals.[157] Those who want to avoid the premiums of copper [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullion"] bullion alternatively store old [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_wire"] copper wire, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_tubing"] copper tubing or
American [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_(United_States_coin)"] pennies made before 1982.[158]
Folk medicine
Copper is commonly used in jewelry, and according to some folklore, copper bracelets relieve [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis"] arthritis symptoms.[159] In one trial for
osteoarthritis and one trial for rheumatoid arthritis, no differences is found between copper bracelet and control (non-copper)
bracelet.[160][161] No evidence shows that copper can be absorbed through the skin. If it were, it might lead to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_toxicity"] copper poisoning.[162]
Compression clothing
Recently, some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_bandage"] compression clothing with inter-woven copper has been marketed with health claims similar to the folk medicine claims.
Because compression clothing is a valid treatment for some ailments, the clothing may have that benefit, but the added copper may have
no benefit beyond a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo_effect"] placebo effect.[163]
Degradation
 Chromobacterium violaceum and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudomonas_fluorescens"] Pseudomonas fluorescens can both mobilize solid copper as a cyanide compound.[164] The ericoid
mycorrhizal fungi associated with Calluna,  Erica and Vaccinium can grow in metalliferous soils containing copper.[164] The
ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus protects young pine trees from copper toxicity. A sample of the fungus [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus_niger"] Aspergillus niger was
found growing from gold mining solution and was found to contain cyano complexes of such metals as gold, silver, copper, iron, and
zinc. The fungus also plays a role in the solubilization of heavy metal sulfides.[165]
Biological role
Biochemistry
 Copper proteins have diverse roles in biological electron transport and oxygen transportation, processes that exploit the easy
interconversion of Cu(I) and Cu(II).[166] Copper is essential in the aerobic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_respiration"] respiration of all eukaryotes. In mitochondria, it is found in
 cytochrome c oxidase, which is the last protein in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative_phosphorylation"] oxidative phosphorylation. Cytochrome c oxidase is the protein that binds the O2
between a copper and an iron; the protein transfers 8 electrons to the O2 molecule to reduce it to two molecules of water. Copper is also
found in many [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide_dismutase"] superoxide dismutases, proteins that catalyze the decomposition of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoxide"] superoxides by converting it (by disproportionation)
to oxygen and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_peroxide"] hydrogen peroxide:
Cu2+-SOD + O2− → Cu+-SOD + O2 (reduction of copper; oxidation of superoxide)
Cu+-SOD + O2− + 2H+ → Cu2+-SOD + H2O2 (oxidation of copper; reduction of superoxide)
Page 12
The protein [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemocyanin"] hemocyanin is the oxygen carrier in most [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusk"] mollusks and some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod"] arthropods such as the
 horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus).[167] Because hemocyanin is blue, these organisms have
blue blood rather than the red blood of iron-based hemoglobin. Structurally related to
hemocyanin are the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laccase"] laccases and tyrosinases. Instead of reversibly binding oxygen, these
proteins hydroxylate substrates, illustrated by their role in the formation of lacquers.[168] The
biological role for copper commenced with the appearance of oxygen in earth's atmosphere.[169]
Several copper proteins, such as the "blue copper proteins",  do not interact directly with
substrates; hence they are not enzymes. These proteins relay electrons by the process called
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_transfer"] electron transfer.[168]
A unique tetranuclear copper center has been found in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous-oxide_reductase"] nitrous-oxide reductase.[170]
Chemical compounds which were developed for treatment of Wilson's disease have been
investigated for use in cancer therapy.[171]
Nutrition
Copper is an essential [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_element"] trace element in plants and animals, but
not all microorganisms. The human body contains copper at a
level of about 1.4 to 2.1 mg per kg of body mass.[172] 
Rich sources of copper include
oysters, beef and lamb liver, Brazil
nuts, blackstrap molasses, cocoa,
and black pepper. Good sources
include lobster, nuts and sunflower
seeds, green olives, avocados, and
wheat bran.
Absorption
Copper is absorbed in the gut, then transported to the liver
bound to albumin.[173] After processing in the liver, copper is
distributed to other tissues in a second phase, which involves
the protein ceruloplasmin, carrying the majority of copper in
blood. Ceruloplasmin also carries the copper that is excreted
in milk, and is particularly well-absorbed as a copper
source.[174] Copper in the body normally undergoes
 enterohepatic circulation (about 5 mg a day, vs. about 1 mg
per day absorbed in the diet and excreted from the body), and
the body is able to excrete some excess copper, if needed, via
bile, which carries some copper out of the liver that is not
then reabsorbed by the intestine.[175][176] 
Photosynthesis functions by an elaborate electron transport chain within
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thylakoid_membrane"] thylakoid membrane. A central link in this chain is plastocyanin, a blue
copper protein.
Dietary recommendations
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Institute_of_Medicine"] U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated the estimated average requirements (EARs) and recommended dietary allowances
(RDAs) for copper in 2001. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adequate_Intake"] Adequate Intake
(AI) is used instead. The AIs for copper are: 200 μg of copper for 0–6-month-old males and females, and 220 μg of copper for 7–12-
month-old males and females. For both sexes, the RDAs for copper are: 340 μg of copper for 1–3 years old, 440 μg of copper for 4–8
years old, 700 μg of copper for 9–13 years old, 890 μg of copper for 14–18 years old and 900 μg of copper for ages 19 years and older.
For pregnancy, 1,000 μg. For lactation, 1,300 μg.[177] As for safety, the IOM also sets [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolerable_upper_intake_level"] tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins
and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of copper the UL is set at 10 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs
are referred to as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Reference_Intake"] Dietary Reference Intakes.[178]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Food_Safety_Authority"] European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population
Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States.
For women and men ages 18 and older the AIs are set at 1.3 and 1.6 mg/day, respectively. AIs for pregnancy and lactation is
1.5 mg/day. For children ages 1–17 years the AIs increase with age from 0.7 to 1.3 mg/day. These AIs are higher than the U.S.
RDAs.[179] The European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 5 mg/day, which is half the U.S.
value.[180]
For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For
copper labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 2.0 mg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 0.9 mg to bring it into
agreement with the RDA.[181][182] A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_Daily_Intake"] Reference Daily Intake.
Deficiency
Because of its role in facilitating iron uptake, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_deficiency"] copper deficiency can produce anemia-like symptoms, neutropenia, bone abnormalities,
hypopigmentation, impaired growth, increased incidence of infections, osteoporosis, hyperthyroidism, and abnormalities in glucose and
cholesterol metabolism. Conversely, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_disease"] Wilson's disease causes an accumulation of copper in body tissues.
Page 13
Severe deficiency can be found by testing for low plasma or serum copper levels, low ceruloplasmin, and low red blood cell superoxide
dismutase levels; these are not sensitive to marginal copper status. The "cytochrome c oxidase activity of leucocytes and platelets" has
been stated as another factor in deficiency, but the results have not been confirmed by replication.[183]
Toxicity
Gram quantities of various copper salts have been taken in suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans, possibly due
to redox cycling and the generation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_oxygen_species"] reactive oxygen species that damage DNA.[184][185] Corresponding amounts of copper salts
(30 mg/kg) are toxic in animals.[186] A minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits has been reported to be at least 3 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parts_per_million"] ppm in the
 diet.[187] However, higher concentrations of copper (100 ppm, 200 ppm, or 500 ppm) in the diet of rabbits may favorably influence feed
conversion efficiency, growth rates, and carcass dressing percentages.[188]
Chronic copper toxicity does not normally occur in humans because of transport systems that regulate absorption and excretion.
Autosomal recessive mutations in copper transport proteins can disable these systems, leading to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_disease"] Wilson's disease with copper
accumulation and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrhosis"] cirrhosis of the liver in persons who have inherited two defective genes.[172]
Elevated copper levels have also been linked to worsening symptoms of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease"] Alzheimer's disease.[189][190]
Human exposure
In the US, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration"] Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has designated a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissible_exposure_limit"] permissible exposure limit (PEL) for copper
 dust and fumes in the workplace as a time-weighted average (TWA) of 1 mg/m3.[191] The National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health (NIOSH) has set a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommended_exposure_limit"] recommended exposure limit (REL) of 1 mg/m3, time-weighted average. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLH"] IDLH (immediately dangerous
to life and health) value is 100 mg/m3.[192]
Copper is a constituent of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoke"] tobacco smoke.[193][194] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_plant"] tobacco plant readily absorbs and accumulates [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metals"] heavy metals, such as copper
from the surrounding soil into its leaves. These are readily absorbed into the user's body following smoke inhalation.[195] The health
implications are not clear.[196]
