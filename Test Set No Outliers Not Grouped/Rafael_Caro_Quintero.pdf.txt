Rafael Caro Quintero
Rafael Caro Quintero (born October 24, 1952) is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexicans"] Mexican
 drug lord who co-founded the now-disintegrated Guadalajara
Cartel with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_%C3%81ngel_F%C3%A9lix_Gallardo"] Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo and other drug traffickers
in the late 1970s. He is also the founder and suspected current
leader of the newly formed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caborca_Cartel"] Caborca Cartel based in Sonora. He is
the brother of fellow drug trafficker [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Caro_Quintero"] Miguel Caro Quintero,
founder and former leader of the defunct [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonora_Cartel"] Sonora Cartel. 
Rafael Caro Quintero
Having formed the Guadalajara Cartel in the 1970s, Caro Quintero
 worked with Gallardo, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, and Pedro Avilés
Pérez by shipping large quantities of marijuana to the United States
from Mexico. He was responsible for the kidnapping of the U.S.
 Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Enrique "Kiki"
Camarena, Camarena's pilot Alfredo Zavala Avelar, the American
writer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clay_Walker"] John Clay Walker, and dentistry student Alberto Radelat in
1985. After the murders, Caro Quintero fled to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica"] Costa Rica but was
later arrested and extradited back to Mexico, where he was
sentenced to 40 years in prison for murder.[1] Following his arrest,
the Guadalajara Cartel disintegrated, and its leaders were
 incorporated into the Tijuana Cartel, Sinaloa Cartel, and Juárez
Cartel.
Caro Quintero was freed from jail on August 9, 2013, after a state
court concluded that he had been tried improperly. However, amid
pressure from the United States' federal government to re-arrest
him, a Mexican federal court issued an arrest warrant against Caro
Quintero on August 14. Caro Quintero is still wanted for his
involvement in drug trafficking as well as the 1985 murders. He
remains at large as a wanted fugitive in Mexico, the United States,
and several other countries. The United States is offering a 20-
million-dollar reward for information leading to his capture, the
 highest value among fugitives currently listed on the FBI's Ten
Most Wanted Fugitives list.
Caro Quintero lost his final appeal to avoid extradition to the
United States on March 27, 2021.[2]

Early lifestyle
Rafael Caro Quintero was born in the community of La Noria, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badiraguato,_Sinaloa"] Badiraguato, Sinaloa, on October 24,
1952.[3] His parents, Emilio Caro Payán and Hermelinda Quintero, had twelve children; he was the oldest
son. His father worked in agriculture and grazing, and died when Caro Quintero was 14 years old. With his
father's absence, he worked alongside his mother to take care of his family.[4]
At the age of 16, he left La Noria and settled in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caborca"] Caborca, Sonora, where he worked in livestock grazing.[5]
Two years later, he worked as a truck driver in Sinaloa.[6] He also worked at a bean and corn plantation in
Sinaloa before deciding to leave his home state altogether to join the drug trade in the neighboring state of
Chihuahua.[7]
Criminal career
When he was a teenager, Caro Quintero allegedly began to grow marijuana on a small scale, at the ranch
owned by his brother Jorge Luis. In less than five years, Caro Quintero managed to buy several other
ranches in the surrounding areas and began to amass larger amounts of money and influence.
He is said to have first worked for the drug traffickers [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Avil%C3%A9s_P%C3%A9rez"] Pedro Avilés Pérez and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernesto_Fonseca_Carrillo"] Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo
before forming the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalajara_Cartel"] Guadalajara Cartel with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_%C3%81ngel_F%C3%A9lix_Gallardo"] Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Jos%C3%A9_Esparragoza_Moreno"] Juan José Esparragoza Moreno,
and others in the late 1970s.[6][7][8] He has been cited as a pioneer of the drug trade in Mexico and has
been described as one of the pre-eminent drug traffickers of his generation.[9][10]

Caro-Quintero is known to frequent the area of Badiraguato, Sinaloa, Mexico.
Caro-Quintero also has previous ties to Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, and
 Costa Rica.
Allegations of involvement in murders
John Clay Walker and Albert Radelat
Caro Quintero has been accused of ordering the abduction, torture, and murder of writer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clay_Walker"] John Clay Walker
and dentistry student Albert Radelat on January 30, 1985. According to the allegations, the two U.S.
citizens were dining in a Guadalajara restaurant when they encountered Caro Quintero and his men as they
accidentally walked into one of Caro Quintero's private parties.
Caro Quintero is alleged to have then ordered his men to seize the U.S. citizens and take them to a store
room, where they were tortured with ice picks and interrogated. John Walker died on the scene from blunt
force trauma to the head. Albert Radelat was still alive when he was wrapped in tablecloths, taken to a park
near the city, and buried.[12][13] The men's bodies were found six months later buried at the San Isidro
Mazatepec Park in Zapopan. The authorities believe that Caro Quintero had mistaken Walker and Radelat
for U.S. undercover agents.[13][14]
Enrique "Kiki" Camarena
 Caro Quintero has also been accused of involvement in the murder of US Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA) agent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrique_Camarena_(DEA_Agent)"] Enrique "Kiki" Camarena Salazar. In November 1984, the Mexican
authorities raided a 1,000-hectare (2,500-acre) ranch known as El Búfalo in the state of Chihuahua, owned
by Caro Quintero.[5] The authorities reportedly burned more than 10,000 tons of marijuana – totaling a loss
of around $160 million.[13][15] Camarena, who had been working undercover in Mexico, was said to be
responsible for leading the authorities to the ranch. This allegedly prompted Caro Quintero and other high-
ranking members of the Guadalajara Cartel to seek revenge against the DEA and Camarena.[16] In
retribution, Camarena and his pilot Alfredo Zavala Avelar were kidnapped in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalajara"] Guadalajara on February 7,
 1985, taken to a residence owned by Quintero located at 881 Lope de Vega in the colonia of Jardines del
Page 4
 Bosque, in the western section of the city,[17] brutally tortured, and
murdered.[18] Caro Quintero then left Mexico on March 9, 1985 with his
associates and his girlfriend Sara Cristina Cosío Gaona.[13] Former
Mexican Judicial Police chief Armando Pavón Reyes, after receiving a
$300,000 bribe, reportedly allowed Caro Quintero to flee from the airport
in Guadalajara, in a private jet, to seek refuge in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica"] Costa Rica. The police
chief was fired shortly afterward, and was charged with bribery and
complicity in the Camarena murder.[19]
Philanthropy
Locals from Badiraguato, Sinaloa, Caro Quintero's hometown, recall that
Caro Quintero was a benefactor in the area in the 1980s. The town's  Quintero in 1985
mayor, Ángel Robles Bañuelos, said in a 2013 interview that Caro
Quintero financed the construction of a 40-kilometre-long (25 mi)
highway in Badiraguato and helped electrify the area. The mayor recalled that before the highway was
built, it would take days for people to travel in and out of Badiraguato.[20]
Arrest and aftermath
On April 4, 1985, Caro Quintero was arrested in his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alajuela,_Costa_Rica"] Alajuela, Costa Rica mansion, while sleeping, just 800
metres (1⁄2 mi) from the Juan Santamaria International Airport and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition"] extradited to Mexico on charges of
involvement in Camarena's murder.[21][22][23] He was sentenced to 40 years for the murder of Camarena
and other crimes.[24] The US also hopes to try Caro Quintero, and the DEA still has him listed as a wanted
fugitive.[25]
Caro Quintero was first imprisoned at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Social_Readaptation_Center_No._1"] Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 maximum security
prison [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almoloya_de_Ju%C3%A1rez"] Almoloya de Juárez, State of Mexico. Even though Caro Quintero was to face a maximum of 199
years in prison, Mexican law during that time did not allow for inmates to serve more than 40.
In 2007, he was transferred to another maximum security prison, known as Puente Grande, in the state of
Jalisco. In 2010, a federal judge granted him the right to be transferred to another prison in Jalisco.[26]
Caro Quintero's Guadalajara Cartel fell apart in the early 1990s, and its remaining leaders went on to
establish their own drug trafficking organizations: in Tijuana, a large family formed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tijuana_Cartel"] Tijuana Cartel; in
Chihuahua, a group controlled by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amado_Carrillo_Fuentes"] Amado Carrillo Fuentes formed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ju%C3%A1rez_Cartel"] Juárez Cartel; and the remaining
faction moved to Sinaloa and formed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinaloa_Cartel"] Sinaloa Cartel under the traffickers [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu%C3%ADn_Guzm%C3%A1n_Loera"] Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismael_Zambada_Garc%C3%ADa"] Ismael El Mayo Zambada.[27] Caro Quintero's brother [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Caro_Quintero"] Miguel Caro Quintero succeeded him and
formed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonora_Cartel"] Sonora Cartel, which branched out of the Sinaloa organization.[28][29] The United States
government believes that Caro Quintero ran his criminal empire behind bars through at least six of his
family members, by creating a front that laundered millions of dollars through a gas station, construction
company, shoe factory, restaurant, real estate development companies, among others.[30]
Release
In the early hours of August 9, 2013, a tribunal ordered the immediate release of Caro Quintero after he had
served 28 years in prison.[22] After a motion by Rosalía Isabel Moreno Ruiz, who is a state judge and
 magistrate[31] the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalisco"] Jalisco state court ruled that Caro Quintero was tried improperly in a federal courtroom
for crimes that should have been treated at a state level: when Caro Quintero was given his 40-year
Page 5
sentence in the 1980s, he was convicted for murder (a state crime) and not for drug trafficking (a federal
one).[32][A 1] The magistrate ordered Caro Quintero's release after he had served time for other crimes he
had committed throughout his reign as leader of the Guadalajara Cartel.[34]
 The release of Caro Quintero outraged the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama; the United
States Department of Justice said they were "extremely disappointed" with the drug lord's release and stated
that they were going to pursue Caro Quintero for pending charges in the United States.[35] The Association
of Former Federal Narcotics Agents expressed their disappointment, too, but stated that Caro Quintero's
release was a result of the corruption that besets Mexico's judicial system.[36] Mexico's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_(Mexico)"] Attorney General
 Jesús Murillo Karam also expressed his concern vis-à-vis the case, stating that he was "worried" about
Caro Quintero's release and that he would investigate whether additional charges were pending in
Mexico.[37]
On August 14, 2013, a federal court granted the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_Mexico"] Office of the General Prosecutor (Spanish: Procuraduría
General de la República, PGR) an arrest warrant against Caro Quintero after the United States government
issued a petition to the Mexican government. Once the Mexican authorities re-arrest Caro Quintero, the
U.S. government has a maximum limit of 60 days to present a formal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition"] extradition request.[38] Mexico's
Attorney General clarified, however, that if arrested, Caro Quintero cannot be extradited to the United
States for the murder of Camarena, because Mexican law prohibits criminals from being tried for the same
crime in another country. U.S. lawyers, nonetheless, may argue that Caro Quintero's initial trial was
illegitimate in the first place and that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_jeopardy"] double jeopardy is not applicable. In order for Caro Quintero's
extradition to be accepted by Mexico, the United States has to present other criminal charges and accept
that he would not face the death penalty if convicted, because there are no laws for capital punishment in
Mexico.[39]
Following Caro Quintero's release from prison on August 9, he has not been seen in public.[40] There were
rumors, however, that he had paid a visit to his hometown of Badiraguato, Sinaloa.[41]
On March 7, 2018, the Mexican military used Black Hawk helicopters to search for Caro Quintero,
dropping Marines into the mountain villages of La Noria, Las Juntas, Babunica, and Bamopa, all in the
Badiraguato Municipality, but their hunt was unsuccessful.[42] Caro Quintero is among the 15 most-wanted
fugitives of Interpol. If arrested abroad, he will be immediately extradited to Mexico.[43][44] The US
government is offering a $20 million bounty for his capture.[45][46]
At the time of the arrest of Caro Quintero's cousin Quintero Navidad in the U.S. state of California in 2017,
it was acknowledged Navidad had become an associate of Sinaloa Cartel leader [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismael_Zambada-Garcia"] Ismael Zambada-Garcia,
a.k.a. El Mayo.[47] On May 1, 2019, Caro Quintero's longtime associate Ezequiel Godinez-Cervantes was
arrested for violating his parole.[48] In January 2020, Caro Quintero's nephew Ismael Quintero Arellanes
was arrested in Mexico on drug and weapons charges.[49][50]
On May 26, 2020, Caro Quintero's lawyer filed for an appeal to drop not only more recent drug trafficking
charges, but also charges filed against him in 2015 regarding the kidnapping and qualified homicide of
DEA agent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiki_Camarena"] Enrique “Kiki” Camarena and Mexican pilot Alfredo Zavala Avelar, stating Caro Quintero did
not have any chance of obtaining the financial resources needed to survive a new trial.[51][52] In court
documents, the lawyer stated “The plaintiff argues insolvency, because he says he is more than 60 years
old, is neither retired nor has a pension, and given the fact that he is a fugitive from the law, cannot work or
perform any activity to earn money.”[52] The appeal was filed before the First Collegiate Court in Criminal
Matters in Mexico City.[51] Convicted former Guadalajara Cartel leader [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernesto_Fonseca_Carrillo"] Ernesto Fonseca, “Don Neto”, is
accused of conspiring with Caro Quintero in the murder of Camarena and the pilot, but was later
transferred to house arrest due to his advanced age.[51]
Page 6
In June 2020, it was revealed that Sinaloa Cartel's Los Salazar affiliate was now a major figure in Sonora's
drug trafficking business.[53] However, both Rafael and Miguel Caro Quintero had recently rejected offers
 to join the Sinaloa Cartel due to a fallout with the sons of imprisoned former leader Joaquín Archivaldo
Guzmán over leadership status.[53] Despite this, both were said to be on good terms with de jure Sinaloa
Cartel leader Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, who was now in poor health.[53] Ex-DEA agent Mike Vigil
continued to downplay Caro Quintero's role in the drug trafficking business and stated that "He will fall
before he dies of old age."[53]
A Mexican court dismissed suggestions that the murder of Enrique Camarena was purely a Mexican affair
and opened the door to extradiction on 1985 murder charges of the former DEA agent on March 27,
2021.[2]
Proceso interview
On July 24, 2016, while still on the run, Caro Quintero gave an interview to Proceso magazine.[54] In this
interview he claims he did not kill Enrique Camarena. He told the reporter that after his release from prison,
he was visited (separately) by "El Chapo" Guzman and Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada. He claims he told
them he did not want to return to the business. He also told the reporter that he was no longer a drug
trafficker, and peace was the only thing he desired.
Huffington Post interview
Huffington Post journalist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabel_Hern%C3%A1ndez"] Anabel Hernández visited Caro Quintero in his home in Mazatlán, Mexico in
April 2018.[55] Despite having security guards, Caro Quintero was no longer able to live the lavish lifestyle
he had when he was a major drug lord, was now living in a shabby mountain home, and appeared to be
aging and frail.[55] During the interview, he rehashed that he wanted to be left in peace and that he also
spends his days looking for drones.[55] He also revealed that he was suffering from an ill [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate"] prostate and was
not speaking to his wife Diane or any of his children.[55] He also denied allegations of being a senior leader
in the Sinaloa cartel or being active in the drug trade.[55] Former DEA agent Mike Vigil, who previously
led the DEA international operations and was highly active in investigating Mexican drug operations,[56]
described Caro Quintero as "a shell" of his former self and stated that it was "ludicrous" to look into
allegations that he might have leadership in the Sinaloa Cartel.[55] Vigil even stated "Right now, we don’t
have any information that he is actually working with anybody."[55] It was acknowledged that Caro
Quintero's cousin Sajid, who was arrested by US authorities in October 2017 and pled guilty to charges of
drug trafficking and money laundering in a California courthouse on January 25, 2018,[55] may have
started these allegations in order to make a deal with prosecutors.[55]

did not hold a "diplomatic post". If he did, his murder would have been considered a federal
crime under Mexican law.[33]
