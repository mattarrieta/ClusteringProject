Robert William Fisher
Robert William Fisher (born April 13, 1961) is an American
 fugitive wanted for allegedly killing his family and blowing up the
house in which they lived in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottsdale,_Arizona"] Scottsdale, Arizona, on April 10,
2001. 
Robert William Fisher
Fisher served in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy"] United States Navy and later worked as a
 firefighter and in the medical field. He married Mary Fisher in
1987, and they had two children, Bobby and Brittney. The Fishers
had a difficult family life. Robert Fisher was described as
displaying cruel and controlling conduct towards his family, and
on many occasions was reported to have exhibited disturbing and
violent behavior. He was unfaithful to his wife at least once. His
own parents had divorced when Fisher was 15, and this was
believed to have played a role in the difficulties that he later
experienced.
On April 10, 2001, the family's home exploded. Inside, Fisher's
wife and two children were found dead. Their throats had been slit
and Mary had been shot in the back of her head. Robert Fisher,
along with Mary's car, was absent. Police named him as their only
suspect in the killings. On April 20, Mary's car was discovered in a
forest near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payson,_Arizona"] Payson, Arizona. Robert Fisher's ultimate fate is
unknown. On June 29, 2002, he was named by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation"] FBI as the
 475th fugitive to be placed on its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI_Ten_Most_Wanted_Fugitives"] Ten Most Wanted list.[1] On
November 3, 2021, Fisher was removed from the FBI's Most
Wanted Fugitives List. Despite his removal from the Top Ten List,
Fisher remains a wanted fugitive.[2]

Early life
Robert William Fisher was born on April 13, 1961, in Brooklyn,
 New York City, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)"] New York.[3] His father was William Fisher, a
banker, and his mother was Jan Howell. They had three offspring:
Robert and two daughters. The parents divorced in 1976, when
Robert was 15; after this, he and his sisters went to live with their
father in Arizona. All three attended [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahuaro_High_School"] Sahuaro High School in
 Tucson, Arizona. According to friends and relatives, the divorce
was turbulent and had long-lasting effects on him. A friend from
high school stated Robert was "very bitter" about it. Fisher
reportedly spoke of his parents' separation with co-workers at
 Mayo Clinic Hospital close to the time of the murders, and once
confided to an associate that his life would have been different had
Jan not left the family.[4]

List
Fisher enlisted in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy"] United States Navy and attempted to become part of the SEALs, but was not
successful.[5] He was an avid outdoorsman, hunter, and fisherman. Fisher worked as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter"] firefighter in
California but was forced to retire after a back injury. He then moved his family to Arizona and embarked
on a career in the medical field. He worked as a surgical [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catheter"] catheter technician, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_therapist"] respiratory therapist.[1][6]
Fisher worked as a weed sprayer for a time in the late 1980s. A man who employed him recalled that he
was a quiet man and suffered from serious back pain but was a good employee.[7] Fisher was a surgical
technician at a Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale at the time of the murders.[6]
Fisher married Mary Cooper in 1987.[8] He was described as a cruel and distant [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_freak"] control freak toward his
family. He and his wife fought about sex and money, with Mary taking a job that she told friends was a
"security fund." Fisher once turned a garden hose on Mary after he perceived her to have spoken out of
turn. Fisher was embarrassed that his son Bobby did not like to hunt or fish, and once tried to teach him and
daughter Brittney how to swim by throwing them off a boat. Hunting partner Sandy Gillespie said, "They
were crying, and Brittney was screaming, and he pulled them back in the boat and he said, 'Now there,
how's that?'" Fisher would not allow the walls in the house to be painted anything other than white, and
only a small number of pictures were allowed on the wall. "Several times her mother had made special
things, like quilts," Mary's friend, Kimberly Sue Davidson, told police. "She was not allowed to hang them
up. She had to store them in the closet. And then he would continually tell her, isn't it time you got rid of
this stuff?"[9] Fisher nonetheless tried to hold on to an image as a devoted family man.[4]
Mary's mother, Ginny Cooper, told investigators, "Fisher didn't socialize often with family because of a fear
of getting too close to people and losing them."[10] Fisher's mother Jan told investigators that she had been
a "yes-sir" wife who did not stand up to Fisher's father. She added that she saw similar dynamics early in
Fisher's marriage to Mary and that she had spoken to her about her concerns. A close friend of his stated
that his family bore a striking resemblance to that of his childhood.[4]
Fisher had been an outdoorsman and a hunter since he was a young adult. Friends noticed him exhibiting
disturbing behavior on hunting trips and other outdoor activities. In one case, after killing an elk, he began
smearing its blood on his face.[5] On at least one occasion, he sneaked up behind a family that was
picnicking and emptied his gun into the air.[9] Several years before his wife and children died, Fisher shot a
stray [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_bull"] pit bull. He claimed that he shot it because it attacked his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador_retriever"] labrador retriever, but police maintained that
he orchestrated the encounter because he wanted to shoot the dog.[4] Fisher had been an active participant
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEALs"]
Page 3
in the Scottsdale Baptist Church's men's ministry, but (in contrast to Mary) had begun to withdraw from
church activities a few months prior to the murders.[10] According to some of Fisher's friends, Fisher spoke
of committing suicide in around 1998 when he despaired over the condition of his marriage.[11] In 1998,
the Fishers went to the senior pastor for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_counseling"] marital counseling. Fisher told coworkers about a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidelity"] one-night affair
with a prostitute he met in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage_parlor"] massage parlor. He fretted that Mary would find out that it was the cause of a
 urinary tract infection that left him ill for several days in December 2000.[4][9] "They did not have a happy
marriage," said Wade Rencsok, a former neighbor. "They screamed constantly. Everybody heard it. You
could hear it in the house next door, and you never really heard him scream, which is kind of weird. I mean
he had a way about him, but you never heard him scream. You always heard his wife screaming. Things
like, 'You're worthless. I could have done better than you. We should get a divorce.'"[5]
Fisher told a hunting companion that he was renewing his commitment to his faith and marriage because he
"could not live without his family",  possibly hinting that he would consider suicide over divorce.
According to psychologists, an intense fear of loss is not unusual among individuals who were traumatized
by a divorce in adolescence.[4] Mary told several friends that she was going to divorce Fisher in the weeks
before her murder.[9]
Triple homicide and arson
A neighbor reported hearing a loud argument coming from inside the Fisher home at 10 pm on April 9,
2001, approximately ten hours before it exploded into flames.[10][12] Police theorized that the murders took
place between 9:30 pm and 10:15 pm. At 10:43 pm, Fisher was spotted on an ATM camera, where he
withdrew $280. Mary's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_4Runner"] Toyota 4Runner was in the background.[5][13] It is possible that Fisher later
returned to the house to commit the murders, but police believe that they had already taken place by then
because he was using Mary's car, in which he is alleged to have fled.[12]
Mary Fisher was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_trauma"] shot in the back of the head, and Brittney and Bobby's throats were slashed from ear to
ear.[10] At 8:42 am, the house exploded. Firefighters were immediately alerted to the explosion, which was
strong enough to collapse the front brick wall and rattle the frames of neighboring houses for one-half mile
(800 m) in all directions.[14] Before firefighters arrived, neighbors used garden hoses to try to keep the
flames under control.[6] Firefighters kept the 20-foot-high (6 m) blaze from spreading to other houses. A
series of smaller secondary explosions, believed to be caused by either rifle ammunition or paint cans,
forced them to keep their distance. One firefighter suffered minor injuries to his leg when he lost his
balance and fell near the blaze.[14]
The gas line from the back of the house's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furnace_(house_heating)"] furnace had been pulled. The accumulating gas was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_explosion"] later ignited
by a candle that Fisher had allegedly lit, waiting for the gas to accumulate and descend to the flame hours
after being lit. This delayed fuse would have given him an approximate ten-hour head start in his successful
attempt to evade law enforcement.[14] The decision to have the house explode is believed to have been an
attempt by Fisher to conceal evidence of his crimes and possibly to cause police to believe that he had
died.[5] The burned bodies of a woman and two children were found lying in bed in the burned-out
remains. They were identified as Mary (age 38), Brittney (age 12), and Bobby (age 10).[10] Investigators
theorized that Fisher murdered his family because he felt threatened by Mary's intention to divorce him, and
did not want Brittney and Bobby to go through what he did as a child.[9]
Investigation
Developments in investigation

Fisher, who disappeared at the time of the murders,
 was named as an official (and to date, the only) person
of interest in the case on April 14, 2001, when
 Arizona Department of Public Safety officers were
instructed in a statewide [URL: "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bulletin"] bulletin to arrest him. On
April 20, the last physical evidence of his whereabouts
surfaced when police found Mary's Toyota 4Runner in
 Tonto National Forest, near the towns of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young,_Arizona"] Young and
 Payson, Arizona, one hundred miles north of
Scottsdale.[15][16][17] The family dog Blue was found
outside the car.[6] It had taken shelter beneath the car
and was in a hungry and agitated state.[12] An
 Oakland Raiders hat identical to the one that Fisher 
Age-altered images of what Fisher may look like
years after his disappearance
was seen wearing in the ATM footage was inside the
vehicle.[17] A pile of human excrement was found
near the passenger door.[9] Although police searched the area immediately around where the vehicle was
discovered, they only searched one out of dozens of nearby caves. Some of these caves form a complex
underground network, extending for miles beneath the surface. Several professional cavers have suggested
that Fisher used them as a hiding place before either escaping, killing himself, or dying from low oxygen
levels.[18] Professional cavers have visited these caves many times in the years since the murders, but no
sign of Fisher has ever emerged.[6]
The Toyota was discovered less than a mile from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Apache_Indian_Reservation"] Fort Apache Indian Reservation, an area which police
never searched.[13] Police followed a set of footprints that led onto the reservation, but uncovered no sign
of Fisher.[6] A couple reported seeing a man resembling Fisher walking along the nearby Young Road
several days before the discovery of the car. According to them, when the woman saw him, she said to her
husband, "That looks like Robert Fisher." However, they waited until after the vehicle was found to report
the tip.[13] Lori Greenbeck, an acquaintance of the Fisher family, said that her husband had gone camping
with Fisher in the area where the truck was found shortly before April 10. She said that her husband
believed that Fisher was scouting the area. According to her, he was very familiar with the region.[13]
On July 19, a state arrest warrant was
issued in Phoenix, charging Fisher with
three counts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-degree_murder"] first-degree murder and
one count of arson. Subsequently, he was
declared a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive"] fugitive and a federal arrest
 warrant was issued by the United States
District Court for the District of Arizona,
charging him with unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution.[1] On June 29, 2002, Fisher
 was named by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) as the 475th fugitive
to be placed on its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI_Ten_Most_Wanted_Fugitives"] Ten Most Wanted list.
He was also on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Most_Wanted"] America's Most Wanted's
"Dirty Dozen",  the list of its most
notorious fugitives, and was profiled on
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunt_with_John_Walsh"] The Hunt with John Walsh.  The FBI
offers a reward of up to $100,000 for
information leading to Fisher's capture.[1] By April 2003, the FBI had received "hundreds and hundreds of
leads."[19] However, all reported sightings of Fisher have been either inconclusive or false.[8]
Page 5
In the years immediately following Fisher's disappearance, some people living in his old neighborhood
reported seeing a man resembling him driving in the area. In February 2004, an individual with a striking
 physical resemblance to Fisher was arrested in Vancouver, Canada, by the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police. The man had a missing tooth where Fisher had a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_teeth"] gold bicuspid, as well as a surgical scar on his
back, as Fisher had. However, his fingerprints did not match. He was held by Canadian police for
approximately one week, until a relative correctly identified him. Responding to speculation that his
fingerprints had been altered, Scottsdale Detective John Kirkham said that there was no scarring on them to
suggest this. The man's identity was not released.[8] The FBI alerted local law enforcement in 2012 that
Fisher may have been living in the Payson area in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gila_County,_Arizona"] Gila County, Arizona.[17] In October 2014, police raided
a house in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_City,_Colorado"] Commerce City, Colorado, after receiving a tip that he was hiding there. Despite arresting two
occupants, they did not find any sign of him.[20]
In April 2016, FBI officials and Scottsdale police displayed new age-enhanced photos of Fisher during a
news conference on the fifteenth anniversary of the murders.[21][22]
On November 3, 2021, Fisher was removed from the FBI Top 10 Most Wanted List. He was replaced by
 Yulan Adonay Archaga Carias, the alleged leader of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-13"] MS-13 in Honduras, and the 526th addition to the Top
Ten List.[11][23][24] "Because the extensive publicity Fisher’s case received during its nearly 20 years on
the list has not resulted in his successful location and/or capture, the case no longer fulfills that
requirement," the FBI said.[11] Despite his removal from the Top Ten List, Fisher remains a wanted
fugitive.[2][11]
Theories and speculation
The murders allegedly committed by Fisher and his subsequent disappearance have attracted significant
attention, and numerous theories have spawned about what ultimately happened to him.[6] Due in part to
factors such as the length of time that has gone by since his disappearance, the small amount of money that
Fisher is believed to have had with him, and the fact that he had spoken of ending his life before, there has
been speculation that he committed suicide or died, probably somewhere in the wilderness where Mary's
car was discovered, and that the body was never found. Others disagree and maintain that he most likely
survived. It is thought that he may have started a new life under an assumed identity.[6][9][11][12][13][25]
One possibility that has been spoken of is that he died after years as a fugitive but his remains were not
identified.[12]
If Fisher did survive, it is thought possible that he hitchhiked out of the area or had aid from an
accomplice.[12] There is a theory that Fisher may have used his survival skills to continue living in the
wilderness near Payson where his wife's car was discovered, although police and survival experts are
skeptical due to the difficulty of finding food and shelter in that environment as well as the fact that no
evidence has ever emerged of someone living in the woods in that area.[5][6] "He could be living in a small
town, where he gets paid cash and he works as a handyman," said Detective John Heinzelman. "Or he
could be in a big city and blend in."[6] It was postulated that Fisher may have crossed the southern United
States border; a hostile encounter occurred in Guatemala in 2009 between tourists and a man said to
resemble Fisher. Fisher's disappearance took place before the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks"] September 11 attacks. With border security
being more lax at that time than it would later become, police have considered this a reasonable possibility.
Police have speculated that Fisher may have started a new family, and have cited the fear that he might
eventually decide to leave and annihilate that family like he did his original family as one of their chief
reasons for continuing to search for him.[6] Some police have however conceded that they may never learn
what happened to Fisher. "Maybe this is the best we have, knowing he did it, and never finding him again,"
said Heintzelman.[13]
Page 6
FBI agent Bob Caldwell's sense of his personality and habits is that he is "arrogant. He's cocky. He's a
know-it-all...and a loner." Fisher has been known to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewing_tobacco"] chew tobacco and favors the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_(tobacco)"] Copenhagen brand. His
look has been described as average, but he sometimes walks in an odd, erect manner with his chest out due
to a back problem stemming from the injury that he suffered as a firefighter, and is an avid hunter and
 fisherman.[6][19] Fisher is considered armed and extremely dangerous and has ties to Florida and New
Mexico.[1]
In popular culture
Fisher was the subject of a documentary titled Where Is Robert Fisher?, released in 2011. It relied heavily
on interviews with journalists and detectives, and also featured interviews with his sister and one of his
neighbors. The documentary included home footage of Fisher taken by Mary, which was described as eerie
and disturbing.[7]
