Premise
A single mom named Gabbie and her 9-year-old son, who are
looking to start a new life, move into a strangely affordable
mansion in New Orleans, only to discover that the place is much
more than they bargained for. Desperate for help, they contact a
priest, who, in turn, enlists the aid of a widowed scientist-turned-
failed-paranormal expert, a French Quarter psychic, and a
crotchety historian to help [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcism"] exorcise the mansion.[3]

development for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Pictures"] Walt Disney Pictures, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro"] Guillermo del Toro as writer and producer.[4][5] Del Toro
stated the project would not take place in a real-world setting, but in a heightened reality. He revealed that
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatbox_Ghost"] Hatbox Ghost would be one of the main characters, and said the movie would be "scary and fun at the
same time, but the scary will be scary."[6][7] In June 2011, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World"] Walt Disney World Imagineer Jason Surrell was

In August 2020, it was announced that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Dippold"] Katie Dippold signed on to write a new screenplay for the film,
after it was decided that del Toro's script was too scary for family audiences. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Lin"] Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich
were hired as producers. The project will be a joint-venture production between Walt Disney Pictures and
Rideback.[15][16] By April 2021, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Simien"] Justin Simien entered early-negotiations to direct the film,[17] and was
officially confirmed as director by July 2021.
