Background
Flores was born in Honduras in 1975, although he has used dates
of birth ranging from 1975 to 1982.[1] Flores has a large surgical
 scar on his neck as a result of an injury sustained in Hurricane
Mitch in Honduras in 1998.[2]
Kidnapping and murder charges
In summer 2000, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness"] homeless drifter known as "Carlos" (or
"Carlo") had been given shelter, clothing and work as a handyman
by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting_Park,_Philadelphia"] Hunting Park, Philadelphia, resident Jorge Contreras.[3][4] On
August 3, five days after being reported missing, the body of five-
year-old Iriana DeJesus was found in the basement of an empty
apartment building where "Carlos" is believed to have stayed.[1]
She had been [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault"] sexually assaulted, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangling"] strangled and wrapped in a trash
bag. A T-shirt bearing a distinct political logo was found near
Iriana's body with her blood on it. When police questioned
Contreras about the shirt, he recognized it as one of the articles of
clothing he had lent to "Carlos,"[3] who had not been seen in the
area since the girl was reported missing.[1] "Carlos" then became
wanted for questioning and a sketch of him was profiled on
 America's Most Wanted.[3]

Arrests and deportation Added June 2, 2007
Number 487
Flores was arrested for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoplifting"] shoplifting in Arizona in 2002.[3] Two
years later, police came to Flores' residence in response to a noise Currently a Top Ten Fugitive
complaint. After giving fraudulent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document"] identity documents to police,
Flores was arrested for possession of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgery"] forgery device, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony"] felony in Arizona. When he was arrested, Flores
had a welcoming demeanor, was friendly, and cooperated with the police during questioning. Upon
entering his apartment for further investigation, officers noticed pornography spread out across the floors.
Flores told immigration officials that he had lived in Schaumburg, Illinois, prior to living in Phoenix. He
was incarcerated for 60 days and deported to Honduras after his release in June 2005.[1]
DNA match and addition to FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives
In 2006, Flores' [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA"] DNA sample taken in Arizona was added to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_DNA_Index_System"] Combined DNA Index System. In March
2007, his DNA sample positively matched DNA found at the crime scene in Philadelphia. It has been
determined that "Carlos" and Flores are the same person.[1]
On March 22, 2007, a local [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant"] arrest warrant was issued in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and Flores
was charged with murder and various other felonies. On the same date, a federal arrest warrant for Flores
was issued in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_Pennsylvania"] Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and he was charged with unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution.[5]
 Flores was added to the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list on June 2, 2007. He replaced Shauntay
Henderson on the list.[6] There is a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading directly to Flores'
capture offered by the FBI. He is also the subject of an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol"] Interpol [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Notice"] Red Notice.[7] He is considered armed and
extremely dangerous. Flores is fluent in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language"] Spanish and English,[7] and is believed to be either in his native
Honduras or to have returned to the United States.[1][8]
