A Quiet Place Part II
Paramount Pictures began the development of a sequel in April
2018, following the box-office success of the first film. By the
following August, Krasinski was working on the screenplay, and
in February 2019, he was confirmed as returning to direct.
Production took place in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_New_York"] Western New York from June to
September 2019. Krasinski was credited with writing the sequel,
based on characters created by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Woods"] Bryan Woods and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Beck"] Scott Beck. The
sequel was produced on a budget of around $55–61 million, over
three times the original's $17 million.
The film had its world premiere in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City"] New York City on March 8,
 2020, and after over a year of postponements due to the COVID-

During a little league game, the Abbott family – wife Evelyn, Budget
husband Lee, deaf daughter Regan, and sons Marcus and Beau – 
$55–61
million[4][5]
and other spectators witness a strange asteroid-like object hurtle Box office $297.4
towards the Earth. The Death Angels, hostile extraterrestrial million[6][7]
creatures that emerged from the asteroid, attack and begin
slaughtering people. The blind creatures possess armored skin, have extraordinary speed and strength, and
track victims with hypersensitive hearing, attacking anything that makes a noise.
Over a year later, the creatures have killed much of the Earth's population. Regan discovers that high-
frequency audio feedback makes the Death Angels vulnerable, and she devises a makeshift method of
transmitting the noise from her [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlear_implant"] cochlear implant through a portable microphone.
With their home destroyed, the family searches for other survivors. Entering a fenced-off area, Evelyn
accidentally sets off a sound alarm, alerting the creatures. As they flee, Marcus steps into a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapping#Foothold_traps"] bear trap,
attracting a Death Angel with his screams. Regan and Evelyn kill it, free Marcus, then run into an
abandoned steel foundry. An old friend, Emmett, appears and takes them to his soundproof underground
hideout. Emmett, who recently lost his family and developed a cynical outlook on life, refuses to help
further and says they cannot stay.
Marcus hears the song "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Sea_(song)"] Beyond the Sea" playing on the radio, which Emmett says has aired continuously
for four months. Regan determines it is a hint that survivors are on a nearby island. She theorizes that if she
can reach the island's radio tower, the hearing aid's high-frequency noise can be broadcast so other
survivors can weaponize the signal. She secretly ventures out alone to find the island. Emmett finds Regan
and saves her from a Death Angel. Regan persuades Emmett to help complete her mission.
Page 3
Evelyn leaves Marcus and her newborn baby at the foundry to fetch medical supplies in town. Marcus
discovers the corpse of Emmett's wife. Startled, he alerts a Death Angel and accidentally locks himself and
the baby inside an air-tight compartment.
Emmett and Regan arrive at a marina to board a boat to the island. They are attacked by bandits, and
Emmett deliberately creates noise and attracts Death Angels that slaughter the attackers. When one creature
drowns, he realizes that the creatures cannot swim and despite being capable of interstellar travel don't have
a clue how to build a raft. The two row to the island where a small colony of survivors is living normally.
The colony leader reveals that when the government discovered the creatures were unable to swim, the
 U.S. National Guard attempted to move as many people as possible to the islands. However, the chaos
from boarding created noise that attracted the Death Angels, leaving only two boats that made it to the
island.
When Evelyn returns to the foundry, she frees the children before they suffocate. The three hide inside the
bunker as the alien prowls the foundry. At the island, a Death Angel aboard a boat drifts to the island and
attacks the colonists. It kills the colony leader while Emmett and Regan run into the radio station. Regan
transmits the high frequency through the room's speakers, incapacitating the Death Angel, and impales its
exposed head with a rod, killing it.
At the foundry, the creature discovers the family. Marcus picks up Regan's transmission and plays the high-
pitched frequency through his portable radio before shooting the Death Angel. Regan leaves the hearing
aid connected to the radio station's microphone, allowing the broadcast signal to be weaponized by others.
Cast
 Emily Blunt as Evelyn Abbott. Now widowed, she leads her family to search for other
humans.
 Cillian Murphy as Emmett, a friend of Lee's who is now a hardened, reclusive survivor
whose children were killed by the aliens and wife died of an unspecified illness. Murphy
described his character as such, "For me, Emmett represents where the heart of the world
lies right now, which is: finally feeling like they've all given up. Here comes this girl [Regan]
who allows you to believe in more, and allows you to believe in yourself. That idea, I've
always been really enthralled by."[8]
 Millicent Simmonds as Regan Abbott, Evelyn's deaf daughter. Simmonds, who is deaf in
real life, described her character's evolution after the first film, "She has a lot of pressure to
become an adult very quickly." Simmonds has a more prominent role in the sequel, and
according to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syfy_Wire"] Syfy Wire, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deafness"] deafness and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language"] American Sign Language "are inherently linked to the
heroism of its heroine." Simmonds worked with an ASL coach to make sure her signing and
articulation were clean. She said she felt "a sense of pressure" being in a position to
represent the deaf and hard of hearing.[9]
 Noah Jupe as Marcus Abbott, Evelyn's son.
 Djimon Hounsou as the Man on the Island, the leader of a small island colony of survivors.
 John Krasinski as Lee Abbott, Evelyn's deceased husband and father of her children.[10] He
appears in an opening flashback sequence set the day when the creatures first arrived on
Earth and attacked.[11] Krasinski said he wrote himself into the sequel because the first film
"was such a personal experience" and his "love letter" to his children. He said, "It was really
important for me to continue the metaphor and we actually start dealing with how this all
started."[12]
 Scoot McNairy as Marina Man, who leads a small group of deranged bandits that prey on
travelers trying to reach the nearby island.[13]
Page 4
Alice Sophie Malyukova as Girl at Marina, a member of the bandits who lures Emmett into a
trap by pretending to be helpless.
Dean Woodward as Beau Abbott, Evelyn's deceased son who appears in the flashback
sequence. He was portrayed by Cade Woodward, who is Dean's real-life older brother, in
the first film.
 Okieriete Onaodowan as Ronnie, a police officer who is among the first to die when the
creatures attack.
Zachary Golinger as Emmett's young son, seen in the opening sequence, who has since
died.
Lauren Ashley Cristiano as Emmett's deceased wife, seen in the opening flashback
sequence.
Wayne Duvall as Roger, a grocery store owner.
Barbara Singer as Woman in Store, an elderly woman at Roger's grocery store.
Production
A Quiet Place Part II was produced under [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures"] Paramount Pictures with a budget of $61 million.[5] It was
written and directed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Krasinski"] John Krasinski, who also produced the film alongside [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bay"] Michael Bay, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Form"] Andrew Form,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Fuller_(producer)"] Brad Fuller.[1]
Development and casting
Paramount produced the first film, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Quiet_Place_(film)"] A Quiet Place, on a budget of $17 million.[14] The studio released the
film in the United States and Canada in April 2018, where it grossed $50.2 million on opening weekend,
well above a mid-$20 million forecast. Later in April, Paramount Chair and CEO [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gianopulos"] Jim Gianopulos
announced that a sequel was in development. The first film totaled $188 million in the US and Canada and
$340.9 million worldwide.[15] John Krasinski, who co-wrote, directed and starred in the first film, said he
considered it "as a one-off".[16] Uncertain of finding similar success in a sequel, he initially told Paramount
to seek another writer and director.[16] The first film's screenwriters [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Beck"] Scott Beck and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Woods"] Bryan Woods did not
return for the sequel. Woods said they were not interested in a franchise approach, and that they would
rather try "to create original ideas" and use their writing credits "as an opportunity to push several
projects."[17] Beck said, "Instead of focusing on sequels per se, it's about investing back into the ecosystem
of original ideas in a massive marketplace."[18]
Three months after A Quiet Place's release, Krasinski decided to brainstorm ideas for a sequel.[19]
According to Krasinski, Paramount rejected pitches from other writers and directors that were considered
too franchise-oriented.[20] He said, "I had this small idea, which was to make Millie [Simmonds] the lead of
the movie... her character opens the door to all the themes I was dealing with in the first movie."[19] The
studio invited him to write a script based on his idea.[20] By August 2018, Krasinski was writing the
film.[21] He wrote a draft in three and a half weeks.[22] In the following February, he was confirmed to
direct the sequel, and actors [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Blunt"] Emily Blunt, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millicent_Simmonds"] Millicent Simmonds, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Jupe"] Noah Jupe were set to reprise their
roles.[23] In March, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian_Murphy"] Cillian Murphy joined the cast.[24] In the following June, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Tyree_Henry"] Brian Tyree Henry was also
added,[25] but later left the film due to scheduling problems. He was replaced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djimon_Hounsou"] Djimon Hounsou in
August.[26]
Filming
Page 5
In June 2019, production began on the sequel.[27] Filming officially commenced on July 15.[28] There
were 47 days of filming throughout [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_New_York"] Western New York, including Akron, Olcott, Dunkirk, Lackawanna,
and Buffalo.[29] Other locations included [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_County,_New_York"] Erie County and the city of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Tonawanda,_New_York"] North Tonawanda,[30] and Barcelona
Harbor in the town of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfield,_New_York"] Westfield in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chautauqua_County,_New_York"] Chautauqua County.[31] Filming also took place on a giant [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_stage"] sound stage
 at Buffalo FilmWorks in South Buffalo.[32] One of the last filming locations, the northbound South Grand
Island Bridge, was shut down for 13 hours for filming.[33]
In addition to Western New York, filming took place in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Valley"] Hudson Valley, specifically the towns of Dover,
Pawling, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Paltz,_New_York"] New Paltz.[34] In New Paltz, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallkill_Valley_Rail_Trail"] Wallkill Valley Rail Trail was revisited to film on a bridge
that featured in the first film.[35] The production invested over $10 million in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York"] Upstate New York, created
400 hires, and involved 300 background actors.[36] By late September, production was finished.[37]
Cinematography
 Polly Morgan was the cinematographer for A Quiet Place Part II, replacing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Bruus_Christensen"] Charlotte Bruus Christensen
from the first film. Morgan continued the first film's use of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_movie_film"] 35 mm film and described its effect, "Although
A Quiet Place 2 is a horror, it looks pretty and engaging, with a nostalgic look that you would find hard to
achieve digitally." The film's "extensive dark situations" (night scenes and stage work that comprised 75%
of screen time) were shot with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motion_picture_film_stocks#Vision3_color_negative_(ECN-2_process_2007%E2%80%93present)"] Kodak Vision3 500T 5219 film stock, while Vision3 250D 5207 was used
mainly for day exteriors. Morgan filmed with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panavision"] Panavision Panaflex Millennium XL2 cameras and T-Series
 anamorphic lenses, which had been adjusted to match the C-Series lenses Christensen used on the first film.
One of Morgan's most challenging situations was lighting and shooting the furnace setting.[11]
The sequel's cinematography also evolved from its predecessor in following more action. Morgan described
director Krasinski's intent, "John wanted to always keep the camera moving and create long 'oners' to play
with rhythm and tension and to show how normal life can suddenly become very different and dangerous
—all in the same shot." Morgan used an array of tracking vehicles, on which there were different camera
mounts including jibs, cranes, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steadicam"] Steadicam vests, with the vehicles often going full speed.[11]
Sound design
 For the sequel's sound design, supervising sound editors Erik Aadahl and Ethan Van der Ryn and re-
recording mixer Brandon Proctor returned for the film. Krasinski instructed them to try to "follow the rules"
set up in the first film and said of the experience, "What we found was by doing that, and not trying to be
cool, we ended up uncovering way more stuff than we ever would've been able to [otherwise]."[38]
In an interview with Headliner Magazine, Ethan Van der Ryn and Erik Aadahl shared how sound (and
silence) was a central character in the film: "We started hearing stories after the first film that people were
afraid to eat their popcorn in the theatre! That was thrilling for us to hear because it's like, ‘Okay, this
experiment that we tried actually works’! We were able to literally make the audience hold their breath."[39]
Marketing
When Paramount Pictures planned to commercially release A Quiet Place Part II in March 2020, the studio
released a 30-second teaser trailer before select theatrical screenings of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Christmas_(2019_film)"] Black Christmas,  which was
released on December 13, 2019. Less than a week later, the teaser trailer became available online. A full
trailer was released on January 1, 2020.[40] During pre-game coverage before the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LIV"] Super Bowl on February
2, 2020, Paramount released a 30-second TV spot,[10] which revealed that Krasinski had reprised his role
in a newly filmed flashback sequence.[41]
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_New_York"]
Page 6
In early March, Paramount initiated "survival room" experiences in New York and Los Angeles in which
groups of visitors could try to overcome "physical and mental obstacles" without making too much
noise.[42] The setups cost less than a million dollars for Paramount. A marketing executive anticipated
 between seven thousand and eight thousand people to go through the experience and for fans and social
media influencers to engage in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiential_marketing"] experiential marketing.[43] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Blunt"] Emily Blunt appeared on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel_Live!"] Jimmy Kimmel Live!
on March 10 to promote the film. She appeared in a parody commercial advertising A Quiet Plane, starring
as a stewardess that enforces silence as a top priority to a plane's passengers.[44] Before the film's
postponement (see below), Paramount planned to host a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_feature"] double-feature event on March 18, 2020, that
would have screened the first and second films and given collector's prints to attendees.[45]
 Following the postponement of A Quiet Place Part II and other films during the start of the COVID-19
pandemic, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_science_and_technology#Telecommunications"] teleconferencing became popular, and Paramount's marketing team started providing virtual
backgrounds of A Quiet Place Part II and other films to be available on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_Video_Communications"] Zoom Video Communications.[46]
For the film's eventual May 2021 release date, Paramount released a final trailer several weeks in
advance.[47] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A.V._Club"] The A.V. Club's William Hughes wrote that the new trailer was a retread of previous trailers
with the most noteworthy element being its message that the film was the "experience that theaters are
made for",  encouraging increasingly-vaccinated moviegoers during the pandemic to go to movie
theaters.[48]
Release
A Quiet Place Part II had its world premiere at the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Center"] Lincoln Center in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City"] New York City on March 8, 2020.[49]
Paramount Pictures released the film in theaters on May 28, 2021 after a year's worth of delays due to the
 COVID-19 pandemic. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times"] The New York Times described it as "one of the first major films to receive an
exclusive theatrical release from a Hollywood studio in the not-quite-post-coronavirus era."[22] The studio
released the film on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount%2B"] Paramount+ 45 days after its theatrical release.[50]
Originally set for May 15, 2020 and March 20, 2020, as the pandemic case numbers had begun to rise in
mid March, Paramount postponed it to September 4, 2020.[51][52] Without a streaming service from 2020 to
early 2021, Paramount auctioned off multiple upcoming feature films but decided to keep A Quiet Place
Part II.[53] The studio eventually changed the date to April 23, 2021,[54] then September 17, 2021,[55]
before moving it to May 28, 2021.[56]
Postponement
The studio initially planned to release the film in theaters globally starting on March 18, 2020, before it
delayed the film due to the pandemic.[57] Paramount had already spent around 60% of its budget for global
prints and advertising, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood"] Deadline Hollywood wrote that the film's delay was "truly a shocker" because
the P&A expenses seemed to indicate that rescheduling was not an option. The studio films slated for the
previous weekend, March 13, were the last to be released before mass theater closures.[58][59] Director
John Krasinski said he wanted moviegoers to see the film together and that with the pandemic, it was not
the right time to provide that experience.[57] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC"] CNBC wrote that in particular, the film and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Heights_(film)"] In the Heights
were considered films best experienced with a crowd.[60]
The film was initially to be released in the United Kingdom and Australia on March 19, 2020,[61] and in
the United States and Canada, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Cinema"] Dolby Cinema and IMAX, on March 20, 2020.[40] Paramount
initially stated on March 6 that it would not reschedule the film in response to the pandemic,[62] but on
March 12, the studio pulled the film from release worldwide with the intent of scheduling it later in the
year.[57] In April 2020, it announced the release date of September 4, 2020.[52] The September release date
Page 7
would have been the start of the US holiday [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day_Weekend"] Labor Day Weekend. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood"] Deadline Hollywood wrote at the time
that the weekend is "summer [box office's] finale", and "typically the deadest period ever for moviegoing",
but that the studio anticipated pent-up demand after pandemic fears subside.[63]
In July 2020, Paramount changed the film's release date from September 4, 2020 to April 23, 2021. At the
time of the announcement, movie theaters in the United States and Canada had been closed for nearly four
months, and the pandemic was continuing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States"] to spread across the United States. The second postponement
followed other studios' decisions at the time to indefinitely delay the Warner Bros. film [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenet_(film)"] Tenet and the
Disney film [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulan_(2020_film)"] Mulan.  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)"] Variety reported, "While those films had been long positioned to help revive
moviegoing, sources say that Paramount did not want A Quiet Place Part 2 to stay on Labor Day weekend
and have the pressure of being the first new movie out of the gate during the pandemic."[54]
In January 2021, Paramount postponed the film's release from April 23, 2021 to September 17, 2021. At
the time of postponement, COVID-19 infections had surged in the United States in recent months. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)"] Variety
wrote of the circumstances in the United States and Canada, "Around 65% of movie theaters remain
closed, and cinemas that have stayed open have struggled to sell tickets." The postponement followed other
 studios' postponing of their films No Time to Die, Ghostbusters: Afterlife, Morbius, Cinderella, and The
King's Man.[64] On the September 2021 date at the time, A Quiet Place Part II would have been scheduled
to open against [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_on_the_Nile_(2022_film)"] Death on the Nile, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boss_Baby:_Family_Business"] The Boss Baby: Family Business, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_from_Toronto_(2021_film)"] The Man from Toronto,[65] all
three of which later had their own dates shifted.
Streaming service
In February 2021, Paramount announced that A Quiet Place Part II would become available on its
streaming service [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount%2B"] Paramount+ 45 days after its theatrical release. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood"] Deadline Hollywood reported that it was
"a clear sign that Paramount is committed to theatrical, but still open to the future of streaming."[50] Before
the COVID-19 pandemic, movie theater operators sought for films to be theatrically released for 90 days
before being released on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_media"] home media. As a result of the pandemic, Warner Bros. opted to release their 2021
slate of films on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO_Max"] HBO Max the same day as in theaters, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Pictures"] Universal Pictures made its films available via
 video-on-demand 17 days after their theatrical releases. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)"] Variety reported, "Paramount's strategy may be
received the most favorably among film exhibitors", with A Quiet Place Part II among Paramount's
tentpole films having the 45-day frame and its other titles having a 30-day frame.[66] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxoffice_Pro"] Boxoffice Pro reported
that the original film grossed 94% of its total of $188 million in the United States and Canada by its 45th
day, which indicated that Paramount's "decision works more in favor of exhibitors than against."[67]
Move-up
On March 4, 2021, director John Krasinski announced that the release date would be moved earlier from
September 17, 2021, to May 28, 2021, which is the start of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day"] Memorial Day holiday weekend in the
United States. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxoffice_Pro"] Boxoffice Pro wrote, "This marks the first time post-pandemic that a theatrically exclusive
major studio tentpole has moved a planned release up by this many months rather than back."[68] The
publication also wrote that the film would be "the first live-action tentpole exclusively in theaters" since
 Tenet was released in August 2020.[69]
Earlier in the day of Krasinski's announcement, Universal Pictures had postponed the action film [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F9_(film)"] F9 from
late May 2021 to June 25, 2021. In the move-up process, Paramount postponed another of its films, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_(film)"] Infinite,
from the May 28 release date.[70] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood"] Deadline Hollywood reported that Paramount was encouraged to release
A Quiet Place Part II earlier due to theaters reopening in New York City starting the weekend of March 5,
2021 and with plans for theaters in Los Angeles to also reopen in the near future.[56]
Page 8
As a result of Paramount shortening the theatrical run from 90 days to 45, John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, and
producers including Michael Bay whose compensation depends on box-office receipts, requested for the
studio to compensate them for the shorter run.[71]
Theatrical release
For its theatrical release on May 28, 2021, A Quiet Place Part II was released in 3,752 theaters in the
United States and Canada.[72]
The film was also released in 12 other markets on its opening weekend, including China as a last-minute
addition.[73]
Reception
Box office
A Quiet Place Part II grossed $160.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $137.3 million in other
territories, for a worldwide total of $297.4 million.[6][7]
Before A Quiet Place Part II was postponed from late March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
Boxoffice Pro predicted the film would gross $72 million on its opening weekend, based on the first film's
opening weekend ($50.2 million) and the continued involvement of Emily Blunt and John Krasinski; but
noted that the film would face competition from other titles such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulan_(2020_film)"] Mulan.[74][62] In February, early
industry tracking had the film debuting to around $55–60 million.[75][76] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood"] Deadline Hollywood's Anthony
D'Alessandro wrote, "A Quiet Place Part II is currently strong with females under 25, African Americans
and Hispanic demos, but overall I hear it's strong with all quads."[75]
For its 2021 theatrical release, Boxoffice Pro forecast that the film would gross between $30 million and
$50 million on its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, with a total gross between $75
million and $125 million.[69] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWire"] IndieWire wrote, "It has a core male audience that skews younger with
minority moviegoers, along with strong interest and critical support", and predicted between $40 to $50
million.[72] According to Fandango, US advance ticket sales were double the sales from the planned March
2020 release and also more than the sales for the first film in 2018.[77] The film made $19.3 million on its
first day, including $4.8 million from Thursday night previews, topping the $4.3 million preview figure of
the first film; both grosses were the highest of the pandemic. It went on to debut to $48.3 million in its
three-day opening weekend and a total of $58.5 million over the four day Memorial Day frame, topping the
box office and marking the biggest opening weekend since [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(film)"] Sonic the Hedgehog in February 2020.[78] In its
 sophomore weekend the film grossed $19.5 million, finishing second, behind The Conjuring: The Devil
Made Me Do It.[79] The film crossed the $100 million domestic mark on June 11, becoming the first film of
 the pandemic era to do so. In its third weekend the film regained the top spot, upsetting newcomer In the
Heights with $12 million.[80]
Critical response
A Quiet Place Part II received mostly positive reviews from film critics.[81][82] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Rant"] Screen Rant wrote that
critics liked the film and praised its "two-pronged story" and the introduction of Cillian Murphy's
character.[83] Meanwhile, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent"] The Independent wrote that critics were divided.[84] The film review aggregator
 Rotten Tomatoes assessed 346 reviews and determined 91% of them to be positive, with an average rating
Page 9
of 7.5/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "A nerve-wracking continuation of its predecessor, A
Quiet Place Part II expands the terrifying world of the franchise without losing track of its heart."[85]
According to review aggregator Metacritic, the film received "generally favorable reviews",  with a
weighted score of 71 out of 100 based on 57 critics.[86] Audiences polled by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CinemaScore"] CinemaScore gave the film an
average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, an improvement from the first film's B+ score. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostTrak"] PostTrak
reported 83% of audience members gave it a positive score, with 63% saying they would definitely
recommend it.[78]
 Peter Bradshaw of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian"] The Guardian gave the film 4 stars out of 5, stating, "This sequel from writer-director
 John Krasinski may not quite have all its focus and intimate horror, while the borrowings from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film)"] Alien,
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)"] Jurassic Park and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)"] Jaws are admittedly more obvious this time around. But it’s a really effective and
engrossing followup, with an absolutely sensational "prelude" sequence at the top of the movie, a
 barnstorming shocker equal to anything in AQP1." He also praised the performances of Millicent
Simmonds and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian_Murphy"] Cillian Murphy, stating that "Simmonds is an excellent performer: bold, confident and
 forthright, holding her own opposite the alpha-emoting presence of Murphy."[87] Jeannette Catsoulis of The
New York Times gave the film a positive review, stating, "...while this new installment is, like its
predecessor, wonderfully acted and intuitively directed (by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Krasinski"] John Krasinski, who is solely responsible for the
story this time around), it has also largely replaced the hushed horror of the original with full-on action.
Faster, coarser and far noisier, Part II sacrifices emotional depth for thriller setups that do less to advance
the plot than grow the younger characters",  and, "Though in many respects an exemplary piece of
filmmaking, Part II remains hobbled by a script that resolves two separate crises while leaving the movie
itself in limbo."[88] Justin Chang of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR"] NPR said that "A Quiet Place Part II [is] an unexpectedly resonant film
for the present moment as this country slowly emerges from a crisis that—while surely less terrifying than
an alien apocalypse—has revealed humanity at its best and its worst", and praised Krasinski's direction,
saying, "Not being able to fall back on verbal exposition has forced Krasinski to become a ruthlessly
efficient visual storyteller. It's often said that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock"] Alfred Hitchcock's movies are so sharply directed, you could
turn the sound off and still follow the action—a truth that applies to these movies as well."[89]
 Bloody Disgusting rated the film 3.5/5 and called it "a satisfying, worthwhile sequel".[90] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A.V._Club"] The A.V. Club
gave it a B− and remarked that it was "a part two in the classic, traditional sense, echoing without quite
amplifying the pleasures of its predecessor."[91] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io9"] io9 declared that the film was "a quintessential great
sequel."[92] Nick Allen of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RogerEbert.com"] RogerEbert.com gave the film three out of four stars, criticizing Krasinski for not
taking risks but praising its "incredibly robust and kinetic" action scenes.[93]
