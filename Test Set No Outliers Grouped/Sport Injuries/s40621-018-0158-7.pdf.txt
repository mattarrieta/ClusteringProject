Abstract
Behavioral interventions to increase disclosure and proper management of concussion in youth sports have
unrealized potential when it comes to preventing concussion. Interventions have focused on changing individual
athlete behavior and have fallen short of the potential for sustained systemic behavioral change. One potentially
critical reason for this shortfall is that other key determinants of risk behaviors at all levels of the socio-ecological
model (e.g. interpersonal, community, policy) are not addressed in extant programming. There is a critical need for
theory-driven interventions that address concussion prevention and education at the community level and target
sustainable culture change. The Popular Opinion Leader (POL) intervention, a multi-level intervention model
previously successfully employed in multiple public health contexts, is theoretically well positioned to affect such
change. POL is based on the Diffusion of Innovations framework and involves identifying, recruiting, and training
well-respected and trusted individuals to personally endorse prevention and risk-reduction within their social
networks. Critical behavioral changes related to concussion disclosure and management have been shown to
diffuse to others if enough opinion leaders endorse and support the behaviors. This article summarizes the
concepts and principles of POL and describes how it could be adapted for and implemented in youth sport
settings. For optimal impact, POL needs to adapt to several factors unique to youth sports settings and culture. First,
adult involvement may be important, given their direct involvement in the athlete’s medical care. However, parents and
coaches’ opinions on injury care-seeking, competition, and safety may affect their perceptions of POL. Second, youth
sports are structured settings both physically and socioculturally. Games and practices may provide opportunities for the
informal interactions that are critical to the success of POL. However, youth sport setting membership is transient as
players get older and move to other sport settings; POL approaches need to be self-sustaining despite this turnover.
Moreover, stakeholder value placed on athlete development and competition, alongside safety, must be considered.
Formative research is needed to ensure that POL principles are translated into the youth sport setting while maintaining
fidelity to the concepts and principles that have made POL successful for other health outcomes.

BackgroundConcussion has been documented in emergency depart-
ment (ED) populations (Bakhos et al. 2010; Coronado
et al. 2015; Bryan et al. 2016) and youth (Bryan et al. 2016;
Dompier et al. 2015),  high school (Marar et al. 2012;
O’Connor et al. 2017), collegiate (Zuckerman et al. 2015),
and professional (Benson et al. 2011; Green et al. 2015;
Orchard et al. 2013; Clark et al. 2017) sport settings. Pub-
lic concern has been intensified by recent research sug-
gesting potential short- and long-term effects associated
with recurrent concussion and head impact exposure in
current and former athletes (Guskiewicz et al. 2003, 2005,
2007; McCrea et al. 2003).
Despite this increased public awareness, prevention ef-
forts are hindered by notable gaps in our knowledge
around: (Bakhos et al. 2010) head impact prevention strat-
egies and (Coronado et al. 2015) injury identification, in
the context of youth populations. Of note, identification
of the injury remains a challenge as previous research has
identified ranges of 35-62% of concussions among high
school, collegiate, and professional athletes going unre-
ported and therefore unmanaged (Kerr et al. 2014).  Al-
though research has focused on increasing concussion
knowledge and awareness at the youth sport level (Regis-
ter-Mihalik et al. 2017; Kroshus et al. 2015a), and policy/
legislation has been introduced at the state and
organization levels to mitigate concussion risk (Pop
Warner Football 2018; Little League 2016),  increased
knowledge and awareness does not necessarily translate to
better reporting behaviors. Further, interventions that use a
community-level approach to concussion identification and
prevention are limited. Such interventions would likely
benefit from considering the tenets of the socio-ecological
model, which posits that there are determinants of behavior
at multiple levels distal to the individual (e.g., interpersonal,
environment, legislative) (Stokols 1992).
This article proposes the adaption of the Popular Opinion
Leader (POL) intervention to the problem of concussion in 
youth sports. Based on the Diffusion of Innovations frame-
work (Rogers 2010),  the POL model involves training
groups of influential individuals to have conversations in
which they personally endorse key prevention and manage-
ment messages within their social networks. When enough
opinion leaders endorse and support the desired behaviors,
behavioral changes have been shown to diffuse to
others – potentially leading to changes in community
norms (Kelly et al. 1991; Coker et al. 2017; Lomas
et al. 1991; Wiist and Snider 1991).  We begin by
summarizing selected key aspects of the state of
youth sports concussion prevention. We then intro-
duce and describe the theoretical basis of the POL
intervention, and provide areas of context that should
be considered for implementing such a POL program
in the diverse and challenging setting of youth sports.
For this paper, we define youth as <13 years of age.
Key Issues in youth sports concussion prevention
relevant to behavioral interventions
Magnitude and diversity of the problem of youth sports
concussion
Youth sports concussion has a large incidence, with esti-
mates suggesting that 1.1 to 1.9 million sport-related
traumatic brain injuries are sustained each year by US
children (Bryan et al. 2016).  However, there remains a
substantial gap in the literature with respect to deter-
mining the incidence of concussion in youth sports over-
all, particularly in sports other than football.
Concussions occur in a variety of settings, including high
schools, middle schools, club sports, recreational lea-
gues, and informal sports activities. However, only in the
past five years have quality data on youth level concus-
sion estimates been collected and published (Table 1).
Examining concussion risk relative to other settings is
made more difficult by the lack of studies as well as the
potential differences in methodologies among studies
that may bias comparisons (Kerr et al. 2017a).

Intervention strategies that integrate primary, secondary,
and tertiary prevention
From a public health perspective, although primary pre-
vention of concussion in youth sports aims to reduce
the incidence of concussion, it is also very important to
consider the secondary and tertiary intervention strat-
egies that include a range of targets for reducing the risk
and consequences of concussion injury (Table 2).  For
such a complex problem as concussion, intervention
strategies likely need to be applied at many points across
the natural history of concussion with the goal of pre-
venting and mitigating progression into adverse out-
comes for youth involved in sports. This framework also
ensures that those who were not protected by primary
prevention means have additional opportunities to en-
sure proper detection and management of their concus-
sions. Thus, alongside reducing concussion risk,
education and behavioral modifications should also im-
prove the on-site and subsequent management of con-
cussion so that the likelihood of long-term adverse
effects is reduced.
Too much emphasis on the individual and policy, not
enough emphasis on community relationships and
dynamics
As concussion-focused interventions develop primary,
secondary, and tertiary prevention strategies, there is
also a need to focus on those levels of influence within
the socio-ecological model that have yet to be addressed,
particularly the interpersonal relationships among youth
sports stakeholders and the social environment (e.g.,
norms) that exist within this setting (Kerr et al. 2014).
Research has also focused on increasing the knowledge
and awareness of concussion signs, symptoms, and man-
agement strategies, among athletes, administrators, coa-
ches, and parents in youth sports (Kerr et al. 2014;
Register-Mihalik et al. 2017; Kroshus et al. 2015a).
Meanwhile, policy/legislation has been introduced at the
state and organization levels to mitigate concussion risk
(Pop Warner Football 2018; Little League 2016). While
such research on the individual levels of intervention
has been highly beneficial and informative alongside the

Table is not exhaustive 
passage of policy/legislation, there has been little or no
emphasis on interventions that consider the interper-
sonal relationships among all the youth sport stake-
holders (e.g.,  among youth sport athlete parents,
between parent and athlete) and apply a
community-level approach to prevention and injury
identification. However, we lack research or established
intervention paradigms on how to comprehensively shift
sport cultures when it comes to concussion safety.
Athlete and community equity
The culture and resources of a given youth sport setting
play a critical role in concussion prevention and identifica-
tion. As such, there are equity concerns about the imple-
mentation of concussion interventions. Social inequalities
in concussion prevention related to lower socio-economic
status have been documented (Lin et al. 2015; Kroshus
et al. 2017a), potentially due to less access to resources,
lower levels of general health literacy, and additional fees
and extra costs that may inhibit participation. Large-scale
implementation of effective interventions could potentially
exacerbate current health inequalities if adoption or im-
plementation is unequal across communities (Frohlich
and Potvin 2008; Bernard et al. 2007; Lorenc et al. 2013).
Intervention programs should utilize formative research
to better understand factors that drive inequities and to
provide guidance on promoting adoption and implemen-
tation in diverse settings. Although school sports tend to
provide a setting that better represents the general popula-
tion, school-funding mechanisms tied to community
property taxes help produce disparities in school resources
(Kroshus et al. 2017b). Consequently, as seen in the high
school setting (Kroshus et al. 2017b), youth sport settings
in more affluent communities may have higher quality fa-
cilities and equipment and are also more likely to employ
athletic trainers, who play a key role in concussion educa-
tion, recognition, and management. To limit variable im-
plementation by community resources, it is necessary to
ensure that the intervention was scalable at relatively
modest cost and could be supported by what available re-
sources were readily available.
Rationale for considering a popular opinion
leader framework
Given the magnitude and complexities of concussion in
youth sport, a concussion intervention needs to be ap-
plicable to the context of youth sports concussions; ad-
dress both primary prevention (e.g.,  head impact
reduction) and secondary prevention (e.g., management
of concussion);  be capable of effecting change at the
community, environmental, and legislative levels; and
respond to social equity concerns (Table 3).  A public
health intervention model used in other domains
(Kelly et al. 1991) that shows promise in terms of

Table 3 Characteristics of an intervention that aims to reduce
the incidence and severity of sports concussion in a youth
sports setting
- Be applicable to the national context of youth sports concussion,
which has an estimated incidence of over a million injuries
per year (Bryan et al. 2016) in a wide variety of settings, many
of which do not have onsite health care providers
- Be capable of effecting change at multiple levels of the
socio-ecological model (individual, interpersonal, community/
environmental, and legislative)
- Address both concussion risk reduction such as head impact
reduction (primary prevention) and management of concussion
(secondary prevention), since narrowly focused programs will
not be adopted and maintained by sports communities and
will not fully address concussions from the prevention and
care standpoint
- Be flexible enough to adapt to diverse settings, so that social
equity concerns are not exacerbated by the intervention
meeting these criteria is the Popular Opinion Leader
(POL) intervention. Based on the Diffusion of Innova-
tions framework (Rogers 2010),  this model involves
groups of influential individuals, defined as those who
are trusted and respected by others, in spreading key
messaging with a goal of changing the norms in their
respective communities. Key behavioral changes in a
population can be initiated and has been shown to
diffuse to others if enough opinion leaders within the
population are known to adopt, endorse, and support
the behavior. Opinion leader interventions have been
widely used in other areas of public health (Kelly
et al. 1991; Coker et al. 2017; Lomas et al. 1991;
Wiist and Snider 1991) but to date have not been ap-
plied in youth sport settings.
Opinion leader interventions tend to be based on the
Diffusion of Innovation framework (Rogers 2010), (Fig. 1)
focusing on factors that affect adoption of ideas within
an entire community (i.e., change in cultural norms). In-
dividuals within a setting are divided into five groups: in-
novators, early adopters, early majority, late majority,
and laggards, all of whom adopt the idea at different
stages. Engaging innovators or “opinion leaders,” 
community members with early “buy-in” of the idea has
been shown to accelerate dissemination and the time at
which saturation of the idea occurs (Valente and Pum-
puang 2007). Opinion leader interventions, such as POL,
involve groups of trusted and respected individuals who
are recruited and trained to conduct public health out-
reach by changing the norms in their communities. An
opinion leader intervention is scalable and can be de-
ployed at relatively low-cost in a large number of set-
tings. Because adoption of ideas occurs in phases
(Rogers 2010), continued recruitment of opinion leaders
for buy-in of the idea helps cultivate changes in cultural
norms on an ongoing basis and can help with
sustainability.
Adaption and implementation of the opinion leader
approach to the problem of youth sports concussion re-
quires development of a carefully planned intervention
strategy, followed by testing of the strategy and refine-
ment of the approach. Fortunately, some of the com-
plexities of the intervention have been refined in other
public health settings and these lessons can be applied
to  youth sport, while recognizing that
population-specific adaptations will likely need to be
made. The opinion leader strategy has been utilized to
decrease high-risk sexual practices (Kelly et al. 1991),
sexual violence (Coker et al. 2017), caesarian births (Lo-
mas et al. 1991),  and adolescent smoking (Wiist and
Snider 1991).
The most widely used POL intervention focuses on
HIV risk reduction in men-who-have-sex-with-men
(MSM) (Kelly et al. 1991). In one study, trusted and in-
fluential individuals in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and
Transgender (LGBT) community in Biloxi, MS, were
first identified as opinion leaders, and then recruited,
and trained to have casual conversations with peers in
their social networks about their personal endorsements
of HIV risk reduction (Fig. 2) (Kelly et al. 1991).  The
opinion leaders were identified through ethnographic as-
sessments, coupled with interviews with “gatekeepers” or
individuals within the settings with an apt knowledge of
Fig. 1 Diffusion of Innovation framework (adapted from Rogers 2010). The framework centers on factors that affect adoption of ideas within the
entire community. Engaging innovators and early adopters, those of whom that have early “buy-in” of the idea, will help to accelerate the
dissemination process. The use of opinion leaders, who are perceived as being able to exert a large influence on the attitudes of individuals, may
equate to a greater likelihood of buy-in to the idea and consequently behavior change

Fig. 2 Sessions included in Popular Opinion Leader (POL) intervention
(content adapted from Kelly et al. 1991). The sessions provide opinion
leaders with education related to the outcome of interest and provide
training on how opinion leaders can have casual conversations with
peers in their social networks about their personal endorsements of
risk reduction related to the outcome of interest
who were the trusted and influential individuals. In the
original study, the “gatekeepers” were the bartending
staff that were employed within the bar in which the
study was focused (Kelly et al. 1991).
In the three-to-six-month follow-up, community-levelreductions in unprotected anal intercourse and increases
in condom use were observed (Kelly et al. 1991).  The
POL intervention has been successfully used in numer-
ous MSM communities (NIMH Collaborative HIV/STD
Prevention Trial Group 2010; Somerville et al. 2006;
Kelly et al. 1997) and international settings (NIMH Col-
laborative HIV/STD Prevention Trial Group 2010), and
among low SES women (Sikkema et al. 2000),  Latino
migrant workers (Somerville et al. 2006),  alcohol
users (Sivaram et al. 2004),  and injection drug users
(Latkin 1998).  Currently, the CDC includes the POL
intervention as part of its efforts to reduce HIV infec-
tions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
2015).  Furthermore, to better aid proper implementa-
tion, follow-up research has identified nine core 
elements of dissemination of the POL intervention
(Table 4) (Kelly 2004).
Adapting the POL intervention to the youth sport
setting
Much of the theory and strategy underlying the work of
the original POL intervention can be readily adapted to
the youth sport setting simply by shifting the focus from
HIV transmission to concussion prevention. Table 5 pro-
vides the preliminary framework for the adaption of
POL to youth sports concussion. Whereas the
HIV-specific POL interventions have recruited the ma-
jority of opinion leaders from the at-risk population (i.e.
MSM) (Kelly et al. 1991), a POL intervention adapted to
the youth sport setting could theoretically benefit from
also recruiting administrators, coaches and parents
alongside youth athlete opinion leaders. At this develop-
mental stage for youth, adults still play a critical role in
influencing youth opinions (Lau et al. 1990; Bauer et al.
2011; Lake et al. 2004; Kelly et al. 2002).
To implement the POL in the youth sport setting,
groups of trusted and influential individuals, including
athletes, parents, and coaches, need to be identified, re-
cruited, and trained to have casual, one-on-one conver-
sations with friends, peers, and teammates in their social
networks. “Gatekeepers” used to identify potential opin-
ion leaders are likely to vary by setting but may include
administrators, teachers, and on-site medical staff. Po-
tential opinion leaders could also be identified by asking
teams who they would trust to provide information and
asking members of the community if they would be will-
ing to share information related to concussion preven-
tion and sports safety.
The opinion leader training sessions would follow the
template used in the original study in which sessions
first provided education related to concussion and strat-
egies of good communication (Fig. 2) (Kelly et al. 1991).
Table 4 Core elements of the Popular Opinion Leader (POL) intervention (adapted from Kelly et al. 1991)
1 Direct the intervention to an identifiable target population in well-defined community setting where population’s size can be estimated
2 Use ethnographic techniques systematically to identify those persons who are most popular, influential, and trusted by others
(i.e., conduct community identification)
3 Over life of program, train 15% of the target population as opinion leaders
4 Teach opinion leaders skills for initiating risk-reduction messages to peers during everyday conversations
5 Teach opinion leaders characteristics of effective behavior change communication targeting risk-reduction attitudes, norms,
intentions, and self-efficacy; have opinion leaders endorse, in conversations, the benefits of safer behavior and recommend
practical steps needed to implement change
6 Hold weekly meetings of groups of opinion leaders in sessions that use instruction, facilitator modeling, and extensive role-playing exercises to
help opinion leaders refine their skills and gain confidence in delivering effective HIV prevention messages to others
7 Have opinion leaders set goals to engage in risk-reduction conversations with friends and acquaintances in the target population
between weekly sessions
8 Review, discuss, and reinforce outcomes of opinion leaders’ conversations at subsequent training sessions

Table 5 Strengths of Popular Opinion Leader (POL) Intervention and applicability to youth sport setting
Strength  As applied to youth sport setting
Community-level reductions in HIV-related risk behaviors (Kelly et al. 1991) May lead to a preventive sport culture that mitigates negative norms
and beliefs that may increase concussion risk in athletes
Used in settings of varying socio-economic statuses, race/ethnicity, and
urbanicity (Kelly et al. 1991; NIMH Collaborative HIV/STD Prevention Trial
Group 2010; Somerville et al. 2006; Kelly et al. 1997; Sikkema et al. 2000;
Latkin 1998) 
Formative research is an essential aspect of POL intervention to ensure
that it can be an effective means by which sport safety culture changes
can occur in multiple youth sport settings
Provides education and dispels myths and misconceptions (Kelly 2004) Intervention includes: education about the incidence, diagnosis,
management, and prevention of concussion; and the promotion of
safer game play
Concurrently considers individual, interpersonal, and environmental levels
of influence (Kelly et al. 1991) 
Training athletes, coaches, and parents to disseminate knowledge across
multiple youth sport stakeholders and change cultural norms within all
stakeholder-specific networks
Personal endorsements from influential community members regarding
risk reduction behaviors (Kelly et al. 1991) 
Can advance community-level knowledge of primary, secondary, and
tertiary concussion prevention strategies, while correcting related myths
and misconceptions
Dissemination framework of nine core elements (Kelly 2004)  Formative research and fidelity measures assess compliance with core
elements and identify implementation factors specific to youth sports
and concussion
Relies on community to disseminate and maintain cultural norm changes
(Kelly 2004) 
Intervention follows core elements to ensure a sufficient number of
appropriate opinion leaders are identified and recruited
The conversations that opinion leaders would have within
their social networks would focus on the endorsement of
strategies for safer practice and competition play, includ-
ing disclosing suspected concussion symptoms and seek-
ing proper management for suspected concussions.
During these conversations, opinion leaders would correct
misperceptions and discuss the importance of safer prac-
tice and competition play, and proper management of
concussions. They would 1) communicate their personal
approval of such tenets of player safety, and 2) discuss the
improvement in performance associated with improved
playing techniques, as even young athletes often value per-
formance above safety (Register-Mihalik et al. 2013).
A comprehensive understanding of the community in
which an intervention will occur is central to the POL
intervention model (Kelly et al. 1991; Kelly 2004). Given
that the youth sport setting differs in several important
respects from the previous LGBT/MSM communities
that have successfully incorporated the POL model, it is
important to consider how such factors may alter and
affect implementation in comparison to previous re-
search. Ethnographic research, inclusive of interviews
and organizational scans, are integral to ensuring that
the POL intervention will approach concussion preven-
tion in a manner that is relevant to the stakeholders in a
particular youth sport setting. Given these concerns, we
recommend formative research to examine how the
adaption of a POL intervention in the youth sport set-
ting can best adhere to the basic tenets of the original
intervention while considering the unique aspects of
youth sports.
There is a multitude of issues associated with adapting
an intervention from one setting to another. However, 
we believe that a starting point of focus should examine:
coach and parental involvement; the structured and hier-
archal nature of the youth sports setting that inherently
places emphasis on athlete development; and the transi-
ent nature of youth sports as players get older and move
to other sport settings. These topics are further dis-
cussed in detail below.
Integrating adults as opinion leaders in the youth sport
setting
We believe an adaption of the POL intervention to
youth sports will likely benefit from selecting opinion
leaders from a larger pool of stakeholders than would be
the case in the MSM communities. This includes adult
stakeholders such as coaches and parents. Alongside the
youth athletes and coaches, they form what is known as
the athletic triangle (Blom et al. 2013).  Although the
goal of the POL intervention is to impact youth athlete
behavior, doing so requires shaping the knowledge, atti-
tudes, and behaviors of everyone within a given youth
sport culture, including coaches and parents. In addition
to their role in communicating with athletes, using both
parents and coaches as opinion leaders strengthens the
dissemination of concussion prevention and care-seeking
messages across and within the different youth sports
stakeholder groups. (Fig. 3). Approaching different youth
sports stakeholder groups may also aid in still ensuring
dissemination of the POL intervention if one group is not
as invested (e.g., parents invested, but not coaches). With
this, the POL intervention would still operate with consid-
eration of the socio-ecological model given that athletes
(i.e., the individual level) and their interpersonal commu-
nication with their parents. Nevertheless, “buy-in” from

numerous stakeholders may aid in dissemination of the
intervention. As a result, process evaluation is warranted
to identify factors that facilitate and impede “buy-in”.
Coach roles in the sport setting
Coaches serve as a fundamental source of influence of
youth athletes, particularly in creating a team culture in
which care-seeking and treatment adherence are perceived
as positive outcomes (Barnett et al. 1992; Poczwardowski
et al. 2002; Koester 2000; Nixon and Howard 1994; Podlog
and Dionigi 2010).  Current research has focused on two
lines of research concerning coaches and concussion-related
safety outcomes. These areas suggest that coaches, as key
players in an intervention program, may have positive effects
on concussion safety outcomes of interest. The first evalu-
ates interventions that use coaches to help disseminate con-
cussion education and prevention. Sarmiento et al.
(Sarmiento et al. 2010) noted that high school coaches liked
the content of the CDC HEADS UP toolkit. Yet, Sawyer
et al. (Sawyer et al. 2010) reported that only 7.2% of coaches
had actually disseminated toolkit information to other
school staff, athletes, and parents (Sawyer et al. 2010). Re-
searchers have also evaluated USA Football’s “Heads Up
Football” (HUF) coaching education program. Although
youth football leagues adopting HUF had fewer head im-
pacts in practice (Kerr et al. 2015b), concussions rates did
not differ from “non-HUF” leagues. One study using a small
sample of Indiana high school football teams with a USA
Football-trained player safety coach had lower concussion 
rates in practices than teams with coaching education only
(Kerr et al. 2016b).
The second line of research has focused on coaches’
roles in encouraging and not stigmatizing disclosure and
care-seeking for suspected concussions (Kroshus et al.
2015a, b; Baugh et al. 2014; Kroshus et al. 2015c;
Kroshus et al. 2017c).  At the collegiate level, even
though medical staff are primarily involved in concus-
sion education, athletes reported wanting their coach to
be involved in sharing information about concussion
(Kroshus and Baugh 2016). Athletes that perceived sup-
port from their coaches were also more likely to report
concussion symptoms (Baugh et al. 2014).  A recent
study with collegiate wrestling coaches supported the
use of autonomy-supportive behaviors such as providing
choice, avoiding controlling behaviors, and acknow-
ledging athlete feelings to help encourage communi-
cation of concussion safety from coach to athlete
(Kroshus et al. 2017c).  Although such research has
largely focused on the high school and collegiate
levels and needs to be expanded to look at those at
the youth level, the findings illustrate that approaches
beyond instilling concussion-related knowledge are
necessary to support concussion safety.
Parental roles in the sport setting
Parents are viewed as important in influencing not only
youth athlete motivation but also achievement in sports
(Blom et al. 2013; Harwood and Swain 2001; Lavoi and
Stellino 2008) and sportsmanship (Shields et al. 2007).
However, unlike coaches, few studies or interventions
have targeted parents. As part of their child’s involve-
ment with sports, parents can also develop social net-
works with other parents on the team and be influenced
by these interactions (Dorsch et al. 2009).  Although
most of the research on socialization has been con-
ducted on younger children (Morrongiello and House
2004; Morrongiello and Schwebel 2008; Peterson et al.
1995; Peterson and Stern 1997), an understanding of this
process builds the basis for conceptualizing the
parent-child interaction for injury response in middle
school children. At the same time, there is limited re-
search on parent-focused intervention programs in
youth sports. Thus, concussion prevention interventions
should consider the role of parents to target issues such
as youth attitudes, behaviors, intentions to disclose a
concussion, and to address knowledge, perceived con-
trols, and normative perceptions in youth athletes re-
garding concussion.
Parents are also the primary socialization agent for in-
jury risk and response in children. Parents’ decisions to
seek medical assessment after sports concussion may in-
volve several factors, including their past experiences
and approaches to sports (Becker and Maiman 1975;
Page 8
Kerr et al. Injury Epidemiology (2018) 5:28  Page 8 of 11
Committee on Sports Medicine and Fitness 2000), their
attitudes about their child’s sport (Kroshus et al. 2017d),
their child’s past healthcare use (Janicke et al. 2001)
demographic factors (i.e. marital status, race and ethni-
city, access and insurance coverage) (Zandieh et al.
2009), and other less-explored factors such as their own
healthcare experiences. Parent income and educational
levels also contribute to their understanding of injury
risk (Lin et al. 2015; Bloodgood et al. 2013).
Considering the physical and sociocultural structure of
the youth sport setting
Youth sports, particularly those in school settings, have
structured aspects within their organization. This in-
cludes physical structures associated with the youth
sport setting (e.g., game and practice schedules), as well
as sociocultural structures related to all facets that may
be considered integral to youth sports, including athlete
development and competition. A successful adaption of
the POL intervention needs to be cognizant of the gen-
eral and site-specific structures of the youth sport set-
ting, yet also develop strategies to maximize facilitators
and minimize barriers to proper implementation.
Using games and practices as opportunities to have
conversations for opinion leaders
Youth sports are structured around scheduled training
and competition events. Such a schedule of sport-based
events may provide infrastructure to have the informal
interactions desired within the POL intervention. These
opportunities should also exist in recreational youth lea-
gues, where the focus may be more on skills develop-
ment and practices than competitions. Formative
research should include a focus on identifying times,
places, and contexts in which youth sport stakeholders
can have conversations with one another about concus-
sion. One possibility is that youth athletes need trans-
portation from guardians to and from practice most
days, which may not be present among older adolescent
athletes who are able to drive. Parents that stay or come
to these practices may also have opportunities to engage
in conversation with other parents. Also, if carpooling is
used to aid transportation needs, parents could also have
conversations with athletes besides their own children.
Acknowledging adults’ motivations for and investments in
their children’s sport participation
It is important to consider how differing motivations for
sport participation intersect with willingness to engage
with the POL intervention or general discussions about
safety. The focus of some parents and coaches may be
more focused on athlete development and competition,
more so than social networking and interaction. Prior re-
search suggests that parents who more strongly value their 
child’s sport achievement are less likely than other parents
to talk about concussion safety with their child (Kroshus
et al. 2017d). Although potential opinion leaders may be
influential and trusted, they may not be ready to advocate
all aspects of concussion prevention or risk reduction.
Thus, as potential opinion leaders are recruited and intro-
duced to the intervention during the first session, it is im-
portant to provide baseline concussion and sport safety
education and to gauge their interest and concerns regard-
ing continuing through the subsequent sessions. Further,
in reality, opinion leaders that are skeptical at first, but
then become more invested in the intervention as it pro-
gresses, may actually be beneficial as they will conse-
quently be able to discuss their own progression and
resulting buy-in in their conversations within their social
networks (Maiorana et al. 2007).
The competitive nature of sports may also impact the
acceptance of the intervention. This may occur as ath-
letes compete for a starting position or when parents
push for their children to have more playing time than
others. It is possible that communication about health
and safety with opinion leaders may be perceived to have
ulterior motives. For example, parents may misinterpret
an opinion leader’s discussion of health and safety as an
attempt to have a child removed from play to increase
playing time for their own child. To address this issue,
the messaging that is used by opinion leaders should not
focus on specific concussions sustained by children from
other families, but rather personal experiences with con-
cussion prevention strategies that can reflect how the
opinion leaders support safer gameplay and concussion
management. In addition, the POL intervention sessions
that allow opinion leaders to practice having personally
endorsed conversations should also provide time for
them to brainstorm how to approach the many unique
issues within this setting.
Changing and maintaining cultural norms in a transient
population
A community is a dynamic population in which individuals
will come and leave. The MSM communities used in the
original POL studies (Kelly et al. 1991, 1997) were likely
more stable than youth sport settings. Membership in
youth sports settings is necessarily transient as players will
get older and be required to move to other sport settings.
Likewise, parents move from these same sport settings with
their children. Also, there tends to be a high rate of youth
sport coach turnover (Smith and Smoll 2011; Woods 2015).
Consequently, a  POL intervention needs to be
self-sustaining despite this turnover between seasons, and
more importantly, capitalize on this opportunity for add-
itional dissemination as opinion leaders transition to new
sports settings. This may involve identifying more stable
positions (e.g.,  school administrator) that while not
Page 9
Kerr et al. Injury Epidemiology (2018) 5:28  Page 9 of 11
necessarily appropriate to be opinion leaders themselves,
may be able to function as a champion for the program
across time. To ensure local sustainability as stakeholders
within youth sports change, transfer of institutional know-
ledge should be situated within the existing infrastructure
of the specific youth sport setting (e.g., team manager leads
the process).
Consistent with the socio-ecological model, opinion
leaders may also more readily adopt and maintain a pro-
gram that is supported by the school or sports league.
School-level support could include ensuring that school
employees are engaged in the program. For example,
school-based certified medical professionals such as ath-
letic trainers may themselves be well placed to serve as
opinion leaders and to assist in identifying, recruiting,
and training other opinion leaders. Not all schools have
certified athletic trainers, and because of different school
sizes, resources, and organizational structures there is a
critical need to develop flexible school-level implementa-
tion strategies that are adaptable to the wide range of
economic and social factors that are characteristic of our
education systems.
Conclusions
The strong and well-replicated evidence base from
the HIV literature suggest POL interventions are a
promising means of shifting the norms of a sports
community so that community members increasingly
adopt concussion prevention- and sport safety-related
policies and practices. The youth sports community
comprises well-integrated groups with a strong sense
of identity and structure. The athletes involved are
minors that require coach supervision and often have
parents present at the majority of events. A POL
intervention could utilize key social referents includ-
ing athletes, parents, and coaches to converse with in-
dividuals at all levels of the youth sport programs in
an effort to diffuse key information that encourages
safer play and improved post-concussion recognition
and response. Formative research is needed to ensure
that the intervention is adapted to consider barriers
relevant to each unique youth sport setting, while en-
suring preservation of key POL principles that under-
pin the success of this intervention.
