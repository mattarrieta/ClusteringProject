Evaluating the effectiveness of traumatic
brain injury state laws among high school
athletes

Abstract
Background: Traumatic brain injury legislation varies across states. A comprehensive nationwide evaluation of state
traumatic brain injury laws is vital given growing populations of high school athletes. This study evaluates the
effectiveness of traumatic brain injury laws by examining longitudinal trends in incident and recurrent concussion
rates and determines if state level variations in legislation’s language affected the observed trends.
Methods: In this retrospective ecological study of a large national sample of US high schools from 2005/06
through 2017/18, piecewise regression models along with a profile likelihood approach were utilized to examine
longitudinal trends in incident and recurrent concussion rates.
Results: Overall incident concussion rates increased by an additional 1.85%/standardized month (STDM) (95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.14, 2.56%) prior to law passage and decreased by an additional 1.08%/ STDM (95%CI: −
1.43, − 0.72%) after law passage. Similar trends were observed for overall recurrent concussion rates. Among states
that specified the category of healthcare provider for return to play clearance, post-law recurrent concussion rates
decreased on average by an additional 1.59%/STDM (95%CI: − 3.42, 0.22%) compared to states that did not specify
the category of healthcare provider.
Conclusions: The passage of state level traumatic brain injury laws was associated with an increase in overall
incident and recurrent concussion rates prior to law passage and a decrease in rates after law passage. Although
not statistically significant, states with traumatic brain injury laws specifying the category of healthcare provider for
return to play clearance had a greater rate of decline in post-law recurrent concussion rates compared to states not
specifying the category of healthcare provider. The findings suggest that state traumatic brain injury laws may
benefit from specifying the category of healthcare provider allowed to provide return to play clearance, if they do
not already include such language.

Background
In the United States (US), approximately 8 million high
school athletes participate in over 60 different school
sanctioned sports annually (The National Federation of
State High School Associations 2018).  Participation in
high school sports has increased steadily over time (The
National Federation of State High School Associations
2018). As participation increases, sports related injuries,
including concussions, may also increase. A study of 25
US high schools over an 11-year period showed concus-
sion rates increased 15.5% annually (Lincoln et al. 2011).
Concussions, a mild form of traumatic brain injury(TBI) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
2018), may go undetected because of symptom variabil-
ity, lack of education regarding concussion signs and
symptoms, etc. (McCrea et al. 2004; Fedor and Gunstad
2015; Williamson and Goodman 2006) Undiagnosed
concussions may place athletes at risk for subsequent
brain injuries if they return to play (RTP) before they are
adequately recovered. Symptoms associated with recurrent
concussions, including the possibility of second impact
syndrome (Cantu 1998), may be more severe and require
a longer recovery time than those associated with incident
concussions (Collins et al. 2002; Guskiewicz et al. 2003).
State laws were implemented to address the potentially
devastating consequences of TBIs occurring in youth
sports activities (Harvey 2017).  The first TBI law, the
Zackery Lystedt Law, passed in 2009 in Washington
State contains three major components: (1) removing
athletes with a suspected head injury from play; (2) re-
quiring a licensed healthcare provider trained in the
evaluation and management of concussions to approve
an athlete’s RTP; and (3) requiring education for coa-
ches, parents/guardians, and youth athletes about con-
cussion symptoms (Harvey 2017). By 2014, all 50 states and
the District of Columbia had passed TBI laws, but specific
law language varied across states. For example, Rhode Is-
land requires a licensed physician to provide an athletes
RTP clearance; whereas in Iowa, an athletic trainer (AT)
can provide RTP clearance (Harvey 2017).
While state-specific studies examining the effects of
TBI laws on concussion rates exist (Mackenzie et al.
2015; O’Kane et al. 2014; LaRoche et al. 2016; Bompadre
et al. 2014),  only a few have studied the effects of the
state laws nationwide (Yang et al. 2017; Gibson et al.
2015). Several state-specific studies found a two-fold in-
crease in concussion rates after the state’s TBI law pas-
sage (Mackenzie et al. 2015; Bompadre et al. 2014; Yang
et al. 2017; Gibson et al. 2015),  while others found no
significant changes in concussion rates after passage
(O’Kane et al. 2014; LaRoche et al. 2016). A full under-
standing of the effectiveness of TBI laws has been lim-
ited because existing studies have only analyzed
concussion trends for a short time period, have not 
differentiated between incident and recurrent concus-
sions, and/or have not accounted for the variation in the
language used in TBI laws across states.
This study’s objective was to evaluate the effectiveness
of state level TBI laws by examining longitudinal trends
in incident and recurrent concussion rates. A secondary
objective was to determine if state level variations in leg-
islation’s language influenced observed trends. We hy-
pothesized that incident and recurrent concussion rates
increased in the first year after passage of state level TBI
laws, followed by a decrease in recurrent concussion
rates and a stabilization in incident concussion rates 2
years after law passage. Additionally, trends in concus-
sion rates were hypothesized to differ when stratifying
by the specific TBI legislation language.
Methods
Data sources
Data from the 2005/06 through 2017/18 academic years
was obtained from the National High School Sports-
Related Injury Surveillance Study (High School RIO), a
large national prospective internet-based sports injury
surveillance system (High School RIO 2018).  High
schools with National Athletic Trainers’  Association-
affiliated certified athletic trainers were eligible to par-
ticipate (High School RIO 2018; Comstock et al. 2018).
The methodology of High School RIO has been previ-
ously described (Yang et al. 2017; Kerr et al. 2018).
State-specific TBI law information was obtained from
LawAtlas, an online legal mapping tool that collects and
tracks public health laws and policies (Harvey 2017).
LawAtlas’ youth sport TBI dataset contains state-specific
legal text of the law across particular moments in time,
including initial law passage dates as well as dates of im-
plementation. Initial law passage date and information
was utilized in this study as opposed to law implementa-
tion because media coverage of and public notification
about new TBI laws was almost always greatest at the
time of the law’s passage.
Selection criteria
All concussions captured by High School RIO from
2005/06 through 2017/18 were evaluated (n = 17,336).
Concussions missing date of injury (n = 467), state (n =
9),  injury classification (i.e. incident or recurrent) (n =
162), or missing athletic exposure (AE) data (n = 7) were
excluded. Concussions with injury type classified as un-
known (n = 1),  other (n = 21),  or as a recurrent injury
that occurred from a non-sport related mechanism (e.g.
car accident, etc.) (n = 6) were also excluded. A total of
666 (3.8%) concussions were excluded. Concussion rates
were calculated using the state in which the student ath-
lete’s school was located rather than the location where
Page 3

the injury occurred because the latter is not available in
the High School RIO database.
Data management
Data management was performed using SAS, version 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina). Athletic expo-
sures and concussions were summed across four-week
increments from exposure weeks 1 through 52 for each
state by academic year. States were categorized into
groups using initial law passage information based on
state level variations in legislation’s language pertaining
to RTP clearance and education requirements. For RTP
clearance requirements, states were dichotomized into:
(1) those specifying the category of healthcare provider
(e.g., physicians, nurses, physician’s assistants, ATs, etc.);
or (2) those not specifying the category of healthcare
provider eligible to provide RTP clearance and Illinois,
the only state at law passage that did not require athletes
to receive RTP clearance from healthcare providers.
Additionally, states specifying the category of healthcare
provider were further dichotomized into: (1) those that
allowed multiple categories of healthcare providers (e.g.,
physicians, nurses, physician’s assistants, ATs, etc.); or (2)
those that specified only physicians were eligible to pro-
vide RTP clearance. For education requirements, states
were dichotomized into: (1) those requiring education re-
garding concussion signs and symptoms for both coaches
and parents/guardians; or (2) those requiring education
for coaches or parents/guardians, but not both.
A standardized month (STDM) variable was created to
account for the variation in the timing of law passage
across states, calculated by the difference in months be-
tween a state’s TBI law passage date and the date of a re-
ported concussion. Concussions reported during the
month of the relevant state law passage were categorized
as 0. One negative and positive STDM unit represents
concussions occurring 1 month before and 1 month
after law passage, respectively.
Data analysis
Data analysis was performed using SAS, version 9.4
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina). Fourteen gen-
eralized linear mixed-effects piecewise regression models
with a negative binomial distribution were employed to
test differences in incident and recurrent concussion
rates before and after TBI law passage. This includes
two models for overall incident and recurrent concus-
sion rates, four incident and recurrent models compar-
ing states specifying vs. not specifying the category of
healthcare provider eligible to provide RTP clearance,
four incident and recurrent models comparing states
that allowed multiple categories of healthcare providers
vs. those that specified only physicians were eligible to
provide RTP clearance, and four incident and recurrent 
models comparing states requiring education regarding
concussion signs and symptoms for both coaches and
parents/guardians vs. those requiring education for coa-
ches or parents/guardians, but not both. A random
intercept for state was included to account for the
single-level clustering and correlation.
The profile likelihood approach, a robust statistical
method used to identify unknown change points in
piecewise regression models, was employed in this study
(Muggeo 2003; Tishler and Zang 1981; Stasinopoulos
and Rigby 1992; Celermajer et al. 1994; Hall et al. 2000).
The method is utilized in various fields of research in-
cluding, but not limited to, infectious disease, chronic
disease, and surveillance related studies (Muggeo 2003;
Celermajer et al. 1994; Hall et al. 2000). The appeal of
the profile likelihood approach is that the method does
not require a priori knowledge of the timing or location
during which a shift in the piecewise regression model
occurs (Muggeo 2003; Tishler and Zang 1981).  The
method identifies change points based on maximizing
the likelihood for the data observed. Methods for apply-
ing the profile likelihood approach are described in pre-
vious research (Muggeo 2003; Tishler and Zang 1981;
Stasinopoulos and Rigby 1992; Hall et al. 2000). In this
study, a number of factors could have impacted the loca-
tion of the change points, such as injury categorization
(i.e. incident or recurrent), specific language of the TBI
laws, media coverage, etc. Thus, the true location of the
change points could not safely be assumed to be known
a priori.
Two knots (i.e. change points) were incorporated into
each model to allow for trends in concussion rates to
change immediately after law passage and during the
post-law period. This was accomplished by including the
following quantities in each model: (STDM - τ1
)+ and
(STDM - τ2
)+, where τ1 
is the change point immediately
after law passage and τ2 
is the change point during the
post-law period. For (STDM - τ1
)+,  the knot term was
zero for all concussions with a STDM of less than or
equal to τ1 
and the knot term was equal to STDM - τ1
for all concussions with a STDM of greater than τ1
.
Similarly, for (STDM - τ2
)+, the knot term was zero for
all concussions with a STDM of less than or equal to τ2
and the knot term was equal to STDM - τ2 
for all con-
cussions with a STDM of greater than τ2
.  In other
words, two knots were incorporated into the models to
allow for the relationship between the outcome variable
(Y) and the explanatory variable (X) to have different lin-
ear relationships at different ranges of X. The knots can
be thought of as values of X at which the linear relation-
ship between Y and X changes.
The profile likelihood as a function of τ1 
and τ2 
was
calculated by maximizing the multivariate log likelihood
with respect to all other parameters in the model. This
Page 4

was done over a range of six-month increment combina-
tions of τ1 
and τ2 
selected for evaluation. For example,
in this study, reported incident concussions occurred
over a range of − 96 through + 108 STDMs, which re-
sulted in the evaluation of 595 unique six-month incre-
ment combinations of τ1 
and τ2
. The combination of τ1
and τ2 
that resulted in the largest profile likelihood was
the maximum likelihood estimate for τ1 
and τ2
.  These
values were selected as the change points for the model
and applied as τ1 
and τ2 
for the knot quantities in the
piecewise regression model. In other words, to identify
the optimal placement of the knots, multiple models
were fit (in the incident concussion example above 595
models were assessed) by varying the placement of the
two knots based on all possible six-month combinations.
The log likelihood was obtained for each model assessed.
The model that resulted in the largest log likelihood of
all models evaluated was selected as the optimal model
and the knot values for that specific model were then
applied to the final model that was used for inference.
The analysis was stratified by injury classification (i.e. 
incident or recurrent) and TBI legislation language
groups. An alpha of 0.05 was selected as the level of sig-
nificance. The estimated rates of change in concussion
rates pre and post change points and their correspond-
ing confidence intervals were reported for all outcomes
modeled. Differences in rates of change in concussion
rates pre and post change points were reported by injury
classification and TBI legislation language groups. Add-
itionally, a two-sample independent t-test was employed
to test the differences in estimated rates of change in
concussion rates between the types of injury classifica-
tion, as well as, TBI law language groups.
Results
The study dataset contained 16,670 concussions: 15,153
(90.9%) incident and 1517 (9.1%) recurrent. A compari-
son of the distribution of states by specific TBI legisla-
tion language is presented in Table 1. The study dataset
contained concussion data for 49 states, including the
District of Columbia.

Trends in concussion rates
Overall
Overall incident concussion rates increased on average
by an additional 1.85%/STDM (95% confidence interval
(CI): 1.14, 2.56%) prior to law passage and decreased on
average by an additional 1.08%/STDM (95%CI: − 1.43, −
0.72%) after law passage. Overall recurrent concussion
rates increased on average by an additional 1.12%/STDM
(95%CI: 0.00, 2.26%) prior to law passage and decreased
on average by an additional 0.62%/STDM (95%CI: −
1.40, 0.16%) after law passage (Table 2 and Fig. 1a and
b). Although not statistically significant, the rate of de-
cline during the post-law period for recurrent concus-
sion rates was 0.15%/STDM (95%CI: − 0.48, 0.19%)
greater compared to incident concussion rates (Table 2).
Return to play clearance requirements
Among states with TBI laws specifying the category of
healthcare provider for RTP clearance, incident concus-
sion rates significantly increased prior to law passage
and decreased after law passage (Fig. 2a). Recurrent con-
cussion rates were observed to significantly increase and
decrease after law passage (Table 2 and Fig. 2b).
Incident concussion rates significantly increased prior
to law passage among states with TBI laws that allowed
multiple categories of healthcare providers for RTP
clearance. However, no significant changes in rates of 
incident concussions were observed during the post-law
period (Table 2 and Fig. 3a). While recurrent concussion
rates were observed to significantly increase after law
passage, the decline in recurrent concussion rates during
the post-law period was not statistically significant
(Table 2 and Fig. 3b).
Among states with TBI laws that specified only physi-
cians were eligible to provide RTP clearance, incident
concussion rates significantly decreased on average by
an additional 0.91%/STDM (95%CI: − 1.61, − 0.21%) and
significantly decreased again by an additional 3.35%/
STDM (95%CI: − 6.21, − 0.41%)  during the post-law
period (Table 2 and Fig. 3c).
Education requirements
For states with TBI laws that required education regard-
ing concussion signs and symptoms for both coaches
and parents/guardians, both incident and recurrent con-
cussion rates were observed to significantly increase
prior to law passage and decrease after law passage.
Additionally, no significant differences were observed
when comparing incident vs. recurrent concussion rates
before or after law passage. Similar trends were observed
among states with TBI laws that required education re-
garding concussion signs and symptoms for either coaches
or parents/guardians (Table 2 and Fig. 4).

Legislation language group comparisons
Return to play clearance requirements
Comparing states that specified vs. states that did not
specify the category of healthcare provider for RTP
clearance, no significant differences were observed for
trends of recurrent concussion rates (Table 3). Although
not statistically significant, the rate of decline during the
post-law period for recurrent concussion rates was
1.59%/STDM (95%CI: − 3.42, 0.22%)  greater among
states that specified the category of healthcare provider
compared to states that did not specify the category of
healthcare provider for RTP clearance.
When comparing states that specified physicians only
vs. states that allowed multiple categories of healthcare
providers to provide RTP clearance, a significant differ-
ence was only observed when comparing trends in inci-
dent concussion rates (Table 3).  Comparing the initial
change in incident concussion rates, states with TBI laws
that allowed multiple categories of healthcare providers
increased on average by an additional 0.73%/STDM
(95%CI: 0.19, 1.26%) compared to states with TBI laws
that specified physicians only for RTP clearance (Table 3).
Furthermore, comparing the subsequent change in 
incident concussion rates during the post-law period,
states with TBI laws that specified physicians only de-
creased on average by an additional 3.79%/STDM (95%CI:
− 6.75, − 0.92%) compared to states with TBI laws that
allowed multiple categories of healthcare providers for
RTP clearance. Although not statistically significant, the
decline in recurrent concussion rates during the post-law
period among states that specified physicians only for
RTP clearance was 0.37%/STDM (95%CI: − 3.86, 2.99%)
greater compared to states that allowed multiple categor-
ies of healthcare providers for RTP clearance.
Education requirements
Rates of incident and recurrent concussions over time
stratified by who is required to complete education re-
garding concussion signs and symptoms demonstrated
no significant differences when comparing states that
specified coaches and parents/guardians vs. coaches or
parents/guardians education (Table 3).
Discussion
A comprehensive understanding of the nationwide ef-
fectiveness of state TBI laws is important given the

growing population of high school athletes. This study
was the first, to our knowledge, to evaluate trends in
high school sports-related incident and recurrent con-
cussion rates in relation to what category of healthcare
provider is legally allowed to provide RTP clearance for 
athletes and who is required to complete education re-
garding concussion signs and symptoms.
Our findings partially support our a priori hypotheses.
Overall incident and recurrent concussion rates signifi-
cantly increased prior to law passage, and incident

concussion rates plateaued during the post-law period.
Although overall recurrent concussion rates were ob-
served to decrease in the post-law period, the decrease
was not statistically significant. These findings were con-
sistent with the other two nationwide studies (Yang
et al. 2017; Gibson et al. 2015).  However, our results
contradicted findings from two single state studies that
reported no significant change in concussion rates after
TBI law passage (O’Kane et al. 2014; LaRoche et al.
2016). Differences could be attributed to the small sam-
ple sizes, study population, and relatively short time
period of evaluation observed with the prior single-state
studies. The increase in concussion rates observed dur-
ing the pre-law period could be attributed to grassroot 
efforts, educational campaigns, and national media
coverage around sports-related concussions that oc-
curred prior to law passage (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention 2019; Schwarz 2019).  The observed in-
crease in concussion rates prior to law passage is likely
not an actual increase in the underlying incidence of
concussions, but rather the effect of educational and
media efforts during the pre-law period, resulting in in-
creased knowledge, recognition, reporting, and diagnoses
of concussions.
Our findings indicate that state TBI laws may be asso-
ciated with a greater, albeit non-significant, post-law im-
pact on recurrent compared to incident concussions.
Studies have suggested that preventing injured athletes

from returning to play until adequate recovery may re-
duce the risk of subsequent injuries (Committee on
Sports-Related Concussions in Youth 2014; Halstead
and Walter 2010; Boden et al. 2007). Intuitively, the RTP
components of TBI laws should not affect the risk of in-
cident concussions, as reflected in the near zero non-
significant post-law rate of decline in overall incident
concussion rates observed in this study. Results of our
study suggest that the RTP components of the law are
effective as a secondary rather than a primary concus-
sion intervention. Continued primary intervention ef-
forts, such as contact-practice limitations and rule
changes should be applied alongside state TBI laws to
attenuate the risk of both incident and recurrent
concussions.
We hypothesize that healthcare providers specifically
named in the respective TBI laws may be more inclined
to review current gold standards of concussion diagnosis
and RTP protocols compared to healthcare providers in
states with ambiguity in their TBI laws regarding the
category of healthcare provider. No significant differ-
ences were observed between post-law incident and re-
current concussion rates among states that did not
specify the category of healthcare provider for RTP
clearance. However, the post-law rate of decline was sig-
nificantly greater for recurrent compared to incident
concussion rates among states that specified the category
of healthcare provider for RTP clearance. Furthermore,
among states that specified the category of healthcare
provider for RTP clearance, the post-law rate of decline
in recurrent concussion rates was more than four times
the rate compared to states that did not specify the cat-
egory of healthcare provider for RTP clearance. Al-
though this difference was not statistically significant, it
is suggestive of a greater magnitude of decline in recur-
rent concussion rates among states with TBI laws that
specified the category of healthcare provider to provide
clearance for an injured athlete’s return to play. The re-
sults suggest that specifying the healthcare provider for
RTP clearance may be associated with a greater impact
on reducing the risk of recurrent concussions. These
findings indicate specifying the category of healthcare
provider eligible to provide RTP clearance may increase
the effectiveness of state TBI laws.
Comparing trends of incident concussion rates be-
tween the specific categories of healthcare providers for
RTP clearance showed a significantly greater initial in-
crease in incident concussion rates among states that
allowed multiple categories of healthcare providers for
RTP clearance and a significantly greater decline during
the post-law period among states that specified physi-
cians only for RTP clearance. The flip in direction of as-
sociations after the change points suggest a potential
underreporting of incident concussions among states 
with TBI laws that specified physicians only for RTP
clearance. Access to physicians may play a role in con-
cussion reporting behaviors. A study that assessed con-
cussion reporting behaviors among high school athletes
with and without access to an AT found that in schools
without an AT, athletes were more than 3 times as likely
to not report a concussion because they did not want to
go to a doctor and almost 4 times as likely to not report
a concussion due to not having health insurance (Wal-
lace et al. 2017). The results suggest that restricting RTP
clearance requirements to physicians only may result in
increased unreported concussions, leaving injured ath-
letes without care and placing athletes at increased risk
of recurrent concussions.
Assumptions that physicians are the most qualified in
concussion evaluation and management may be inaccur-
ate; some non-physician healthcare professionals (e.g.,
school ATs, school nurses, physical therapist at concus-
sion clinics, etc.) may be more knowledgeable and/or
may possess more up-to-date concussion training than
some general physicians who rarely treat concussed
youth athletes (Itriyeva et al. 2017; Zonfrillo et al. 2012).
The small magnitude and lack of statistical significance
observed for post-law recurrent concussion rates,
coupled with the potential underreporting of incident
concussions that is likely attributed to access to health-
care and reporting behaviors suggests that restricting
clearance requirements to physicians only may not be
the most effective approach for TBI legislation. Our re-
sults suggest that states should allow multiple categories
of healthcare providers to provide RTP clearance, in-
stead of restricting the requirements to physicians only.
Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this study include the use of the High
School RIO database, which allowed for a nationwide as-
sessment of longitudinal trends in high school sports-
related concussion rates in relation to state TBI law pas-
sage. Stratification by state level variations in legislation’s
language was another strength, as it was not assessed in
previous studies. The ability to distinguish between inci-
dent and recurrent concussions was vital in evaluating
concussion trends, as TBI laws function as a secondary
rather than a primary concussion intervention. Finally,
the profile likelihood method allowed for the identifica-
tion of change points without need of a priori knowledge
or assumptions regarding the timing of the shift in the
piecewise regression models.
This study has several limitations. Schools participat-
ing in High School RIO may not be representative of all
high schools as only schools with an AT were eligible.
Concussion rates may be higher in High School RIO
schools as an AT’s presence potentially increases the
likelihood of concussion recognition. While an AT’s
Page 10
Arakkal et al. Injury Epidemiology (2020) 7:12  Page 10 of 11
participation may limit generalizability, it improves data
quality. Because the profile likelihood method identifies
the optimal change points in the dataset, there may be
an issue of overestimated precision of the parameter
estimates leading to type I  error inflation. A non-
parametric bootstrapping approach was attempted to de-
rive unbiased standard errors. However, due to highly
influential observations, the bootstrap distributions for
all 14 models of interest were found to be asymmetrical
and heavily skewed. This resulted in unusable bootstrap
standard errors and percentile confidence intervals.
Therefore, the results presented in this study represent
unadjusted standard errors that are smaller and confi-
dence intervals narrower than they likely should be. Fu-
ture studies should address the overestimated precision
issues by potentially utilizing a parametric bootstrap-
ping approach. Finally, we did not account for any
state-specific amendments made to the law since initial
TBI law passage, which may have affected post-law
concussion rates. Future studies should account for the
specific language of TBI laws as a potential time-
varying covariate. Additionally, future studies might
consider changes between date of law passage and date
of implementation of TBI laws as well as potential wan-
ing compliance with legislation years after implementa-
tion. Despite these limitations, this study was the first
to evaluate associations between the specific language
used in state TBI laws and observed trends in incident
and recurrent concussion rates.
Conclusions
We found an increase in overall concussion rates prior
to law passage and a decrease in rates during the post-
law period for both incident and recurrent concussions.
Trends in incident and recurrent concussion rates were
observed to differ by state level variations in legislation’s
language, specifically for language relating to category of
healthcare provider for RTP clearance. States may bene-
fit from specifying the category of healthcare provider
for RTP clearance in their respective TBI laws, if they
have not done so already. Additionally, specifying physi-
cians only for RTP clearance, although intuitively rea-
sonable, may not be necessary and may result in
underreporting of concussions. States may benefit from
allowing multiple categories of healthcare providers to
provide RTP clearance. The findings may have implica-
tions for state lawmakers considering revisions to
current TBI legislation.
