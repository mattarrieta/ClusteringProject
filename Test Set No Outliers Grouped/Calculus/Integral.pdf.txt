Integral
In mathematics, an integral assigns numbers to
functions in a way that describes displacement, area,
volume, and other concepts that arise by combining
 infinitesimal data. The process of finding integrals is
called integration.  Along with differentiation,
integration is a fundamental, essential operation of
calculus,[a] and serves as a tool to solve problems in
mathematics and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"] physics involving the area of an
arbitrary shape, the length of a curve, and the volume
of a solid, among others.
The integrals enumerated here are those termed
definite integrals,  which can be interpreted as the
signed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"] area of the region in the plane that is bounded
by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function"] graph of a given [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"] function between two points in
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_line"] real line. Conventionally, areas above the
horizontal axis of the plane are positive while areas
below are negative. Integrals also refer to the concept
of an antiderivative, a function whose derivative is the
given function. In this case, they are called indefinite 
A definite integral of a function can be represented
as the signed area of the region bounded by its
graph.
integrals. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus"] fundamental theorem of calculus relates
definite integrals with differentiation and provides a method to compute the definite integral of a function
when its antiderivative is known.
Although methods of calculating areas and volumes dated from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_mathematics"] ancient Greek mathematics, the principles
of integration were formulated independently by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton"] Isaac Newton and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz"] Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late
17th century, who thought of the area under a curve as an infinite sum of rectangles of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal"] infinitesimal width.
 Bernhard Riemann later gave a rigorous definition of integrals, which is based on a limiting procedure that
approximates the area of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curvilinear_coordinates"] curvilinear region by breaking the region into infinitesimally thin vertical slabs.
In the early 20th century, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Lebesgue"] Henri Lebesgue generalized Riemann's formulation by introducing what is now
referred to as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_integration"] Lebesgue integral; it is more robust than Riemann's in the sense that a wider class of
functions are Lebesgue-integrable.
Integrals may be generalized depending on the type of the function as well as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(mathematical_analysis)"] domain over which the
integration is performed. For example, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral"] line integral is defined for functions of two or more variables, and
 the interval of integration is replaced by a curve connecting the two endpoints of the interval. In a surface
integral, the curve is replaced by a piece of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_(mathematics)"] surface in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space"] three-dimensional space.

Pre-calculus integration
The first documented systematic technique capable of determining integrals is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion"] method of exhaustion of
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek"] ancient Greek astronomer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus"] Eudoxus (ca. 370 BC), which sought to find areas and volumes by breaking
them up into an infinite number of divisions for which the area or volume was known.[1] This method was
 further developed and employed by Archimedes in the 3rd century BC and used to calculate the area of a
circle, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_area"] surface area and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"] volume of a sphere, area of an ellipse, the area under a parabola, the volume of a
segment of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraboloid"] paraboloid of revolution, the volume of a segment of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid"] hyperboloid of revolution, and the area
of a spiral.[2]
A similar method was independently developed in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"] China around the 3rd century AD by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Hui"] Liu Hui, who used
it to find the area of the circle. This method was later used in the 5th century by Chinese father-and-son
mathematicians [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zu_Chongzhi"] Zu Chongzhi and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zu_Geng_(mathematician)"] Zu Geng to find the volume of a sphere.[3]
In the Middle East, Hasan Ibn al-Haytham, Latinized as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen"] Alhazen (c. 965 – c. 1040 AD) derived a formula
for the sum of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_power"] fourth powers.[4] He used the results to carry out what would now be called an integration of
this function, where the formulae for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to
calculate the volume of a paraboloid.[5]
The next significant advances in integral calculus did not begin to appear until the 17th century. At this
time, the work of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonaventura_Cavalieri"] Cavalieri with his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_Indivisibles"] method of Indivisibles, and work by Fermat, began to lay the
foundations of modern calculus,[6] with Cavalieri computing the integrals of xn up to degree n = 9 in
 Cavalieri's quadrature formula.[7] Further steps were made in the early 17th century by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Barrow"] Barrow and
Torricelli, who provided the first hints of a connection between integration and differentiation. Barrow
provided the first proof of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus"] fundamental theorem of calculus.[8] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis"] Wallis generalized Cavalieri's method,
computing integrals of x to a general power, including negative powers and fractional powers.[9]
Leibniz and Newton
The major advance in integration came in the 17th century with the independent discovery of the
 fundamental theorem of calculus by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz"] Leibniz and Newton.[10] The theorem demonstrates a connection
between integration and differentiation. This connection, combined with the comparative ease of
differentiation, can be exploited to calculate integrals. In particular, the fundamental theorem of calculus
allows one to solve a much broader class of problems. Equal in importance is the comprehensive
mathematical framework that both Leibniz and Newton developed. Given the name infinitesimal calculus,
it allowed for precise analysis of functions within continuous domains. This framework eventually became
modern calculus, whose notation for integrals is drawn directly from the work of Leibniz.
Formalization
While Newton and Leibniz provided a systematic approach to integration, their work lacked a degree of
rigour. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley"] Bishop Berkeley memorably attacked the vanishing increments used by Newton, calling them
"[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Analyst#Content"] ghosts of departed quantities".[11] Calculus acquired a firmer footing with the development of limits.
Integration was first rigorously formalized, using limits, by Riemann.[12] Although all bounded piecewise
continuous functions are Riemann-integrable on a bounded interval, subsequently more general functions
were considered—particularly in the context of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis"] Fourier analysis—to which Riemann's definition does not
apply, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Lebesgue"] Lebesgue formulated a different definition of integral, founded in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"] measure theory (a subfield of
 real analysis).  Other definitions of integral, extending Riemann's and Lebesgue's approaches, were
Page 4
proposed. These approaches based on the real number system are the ones most common today, but
alternative approaches exist, such as a definition of integral as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_part"] standard part of an infinite Riemann sum,
based on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number"] hyperreal number system.
Historical notation
The notation for the indefinite integral was introduced by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz"] Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1675.[13] He
adapted the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_symbol"] integral symbol, ∫, from the letter ſ ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_s"] long s), standing for summa (written as ſumma; Latin for
"sum" or "total"). The modern notation for the definite integral, with limits above and below the integral
sign, was first used by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fourier"] Joseph Fourier in Mémoires of the French Academy around 1819–20, reprinted in
his book of 1822.[14]
 Isaac Newton used a small vertical bar above a variable to indicate integration, or placed the variable inside
.
a box. The vertical bar was easily confused with x or x′, which are used to indicate differentiation, and the
box notation was difficult for printers to reproduce, so these notations were not widely adopted.[15]
First use of the term
The term was first printed in Latin by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Bernoulli"] Jacob Bernoulli in 1690: "Ergo et horum Integralia aequantur".[16]
Terminology and notation
In general, the integral of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-valued_function"] real-valued function f(x) with respect to a real variable x on an interval [a, b]
is written as
The integral sign ∫ represents integration. The symbol dx, called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(infinitesimal)"] differential of the variable x, indicates
that the variable of integration is x. The function f(x) is called the integrand, the points a and b are called
the limits (or bounds) of integration, and the integral is said to be over the interval [a, b], called the interval
of integration.[17] A function is said to be integrable if its integral over its domain is finite. If limits are
specified, the integral is called a definite integral.
When the limits are omitted, as in
the integral is called an indefinite integral, which represents a class of functions (the antiderivative) whose
derivative is the integrand.[18] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus"] fundamental theorem of calculus relates the evaluation of definite
integrals to indefinite integrals. There are several extensions of the notation for integrals to encompass
integration on unbounded domains and/or in multiple dimensions (see later sections of this article).
In advanced settings, it is not uncommon to leave out dx when only the simple Riemann integral is being
used, or the exact type of integral is immaterial. For instance, one might write
to express the linearity of the integral, a property shared by the
Riemann integral and all generalizations thereof.[19]
Page 5
Interpretations
Integrals appear in many practical situations. For instance, from the
length, width and depth of a swimming pool which is rectangular
with a flat bottom, one can determine the volume of water it can
contain, the area of its surface, and the length of its edge. But if it is
oval with a rounded bottom, integrals are required to find exact and
rigorous values for these quantities. In each case, one may divide
the sought quantity into infinitely many [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal"] infinitesimal pieces, then
sum the pieces to achieve an accurate approximation.
For example, to find the area of the region bounded by the graph of
the function f(x) = √x between x = 0 and x = 1, one can cross
the interval in five steps (0, 1/5, 2/5, ..., 1), then fill a rectangle
using the right end height of each piece (thus
√0, √1/5, √2/5, ...,  √1) and sum their areas to get an
approximation of 
Approximations to integral of √x
from 0 to 1, with 5 yellow right
endpoint partitions and 12 green left
endpoint partitions
which is larger than the exact value. Alternatively, when replacing these subintervals by ones with the left
end height of each piece, the approximation one gets is too low: with twelve such subintervals the
approximated area is only 0.6203. However, when the number of pieces increase to infinity, it will reach a
limit which is the exact value of the area sought (in this case, 2/3). One writes
which means 2/3 is the result of a weighted sum of function values, √x, multiplied by the infinitesimal
step widths, denoted by dx, on the interval [0, 1].

There are many ways of formally defining an integral, not all of which
are equivalent. The differences exist mostly to deal with differing
special cases which may not be integrable under other definitions, but
also occasionally for pedagogical reasons. The most commonly used
definitions are Riemann integrals and Lebesgue integrals.
Riemann integral
The Riemann integral is defined in terms of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum"] Riemann sums of
functions with respect to tagged partitions of an interval.[20] A tagged
partition of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_interval"] closed interval [a, b] on the real line is a finite sequence Riemann sums converging
This partitions the interval [a, b] into n sub-intervals [xi−1, xi] indexed by i, each of which is "tagged"
with a distinguished point ti ∈ [xi−1, xi]. A Riemann sum of a function f with respect to such a tagged
partition is defined as
thus each term of the sum is the area of a rectangle with height equal to the function value at the
distinguished point of the given sub-interval, and width the same as the width of sub-interval,
Δi = xi−xi−1. The mesh of such a tagged partition is the width of the largest sub-interval formed by the
partition, maxi=1...n Δi. The Riemann integral of a function f over the interval [a, b] is equal to S if:[21]
For all
, 
there exists such that, for any tagged partition with mesh less than
When the chosen tags give the maximum (respectively, minimum) value of each interval, the Riemann sum
becomes an upper (respectively, lower) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darboux_integral"] Darboux sum, suggesting the close connection between the
Riemann integral and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darboux_integral"] Darboux integral.
Lebesgue integral
It is often of interest, both in theory and applications, to be able to pass to the limit under the integral. For
instance, a sequence of functions can frequently be constructed that approximate, in a suitable sense, the
solution to a problem. Then the integral of the solution function should be the limit of the integrals of the
approximations. However, many functions that can be obtained as limits are not Riemann-integrable, and so
such limit theorems do not hold with the Riemann integral. Therefore, it is of great importance to have a
definition of the integral that allows a wider class of functions to be integrated.[22]
Page 7
Such an integral is the Lebesgue integral, that exploits the
following fact to enlarge the class of integrable functions: if the
values of a function are rearranged over the domain, the
 integral of a function should remain the same. Thus Henri
Lebesgue introduced the integral bearing his name, explaining
this integral thus in a letter to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Montel"] Paul Montel:[23]
I have to pay a certain sum, which I have
collected in my pocket. I take the bills and coins
out of my pocket and give them to the creditor in
the order I find them until I have reached the total
sum. This is the Riemann integral. But I can
proceed differently. After I have taken all the
money out of my pocket I order the bills and
coins according to identical values and then I pay
the several heaps one after the other to the
creditor. This is my integral. 
Riemann–Darboux's integration (top) and
Lebesgue integration (bottom)
As Folland puts it, "To compute the Riemann integral of f,  one partitions the domain [a, b] into
subintervals", while in the Lebesgue integral, "one is in effect partitioning the range of f ".[24] The
 definition of the Lebesgue integral thus begins with a measure, μ. In the simplest case, the Lebesgue
measure μ(A) of an interval A = [a, b] is its width, b − a, so that the Lebesgue integral agrees with the
(proper) Riemann integral when both exist.[25] In more complicated cases, the sets being measured can be
highly fragmented, with no continuity and no resemblance to intervals.
Using the "partitioning the range of f " philosophy, the integral of a non-negative function f : R → R
should be the sum over t of the areas between a thin horizontal strip between y = t and y = t + dt. This
area is just μ{ x : f(x) > t} dt. Let f∗(t) = μ{ x : f(x) > t }. The Lebesgue integral of f is then defined
by
where the integral on the right is an ordinary improper Riemann integral (f∗ is a strictly decreasing positive
function, and therefore has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-defined"] well-defined improper Riemann integral).[26] For a suitable class of functions
(the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_function"] measurable functions) this defines the Lebesgue integral.
A general measurable function f is Lebesgue-integrable if the sum of the absolute values of the areas of the
regions between the graph of f and the x-axis is finite:[27]
In that case, the integral is, as in the Riemannian case, the difference between the area above the x-axis and
the area below the x-axis:[28]

number of others exist, including:
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darboux_integral"] Darboux integral, which is defined by Darboux sums (restricted Riemann sums) yet is
equivalent to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_integral"] Riemann integral - a function is Darboux-integrable if and only if it is
Riemann-integrable. Darboux integrals have the advantage of being easier to define than

Properties
Linearity
The collection of Riemann-integrable functions on a closed interval [a, b] forms a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space"] vector space under the
operations of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_addition"] pointwise addition and multiplication by a scalar, and the operation of integration
is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_functional"] linear functional on this vector space. Thus, the collection of integrable functions is closed under taking
 linear combinations, and the integral of a linear combination is the linear combination of the integrals:[29]
Page 9
Similarly, the set of real-valued Lebesgue-integrable functions on a given [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_(mathematics)"] measure space E with measure μ
is closed under taking linear combinations and hence form a vector space, and the Lebesgue integral
is a linear functional on this vector space, so that:[28]
More generally, consider the vector space of all [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_function"] measurable functions on a measure space (E,μ), taking
values in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact_space"] locally compact [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_metric_space"] complete [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_vector_space"] topological vector space V over a locally compact [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_ring"] topological field
K, f : E → V. Then one may define an abstract integration map assigning to each function f an element of
V or the symbol ∞,
that is compatible with linear combinations.[30] In this situation, the linearity holds for the subspace of
functions whose integral is an element of V (i.e. "finite"). The most important special cases arise when K is
R, C, or a finite extension of the field Qp of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-adic_number"] p-adic numbers, and V is a finite-dimensional vector space
over K, and when K = C and V is a complex [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space"] Hilbert space.
Linearity, together with some natural continuity properties and normalization for a certain class of "simple"
functions, may be used to give an alternative definition of the integral. This is the approach of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniell_integral"] Daniell for
the case of real-valued functions on a set X, generalized by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Bourbaki"] Nicolas Bourbaki to functions with values in a
locally compact topological vector space. See Hildebrandt 1953 for an axiomatic characterization of the
integral.
Inequalities
A number of general inequalities hold for Riemann-integrable [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"] functions defined on a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_set"] closed and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_set"] bounded
 interval [a, b] and can be generalized to other notions of integral (Lebesgue and Daniell).
Upper and lower bounds. An integrable function f on [a, b], is necessarily [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_function"] bounded on that
interval. Thus there are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"] real numbers m and M so that m ≤ f (x) ≤ M for all x in [a, b]. Since
the lower and upper sums of f over [a, b] are therefore bounded by, respectively, m(b − a)
and M(b − a), it follows that
Inequalities between functions.[31] If f(x) ≤ g(x) for each x in [a, b] then each of the upper
and lower sums of f is bounded above by the upper and lower sums, respectively, of g. Thus
Page 10
This is a generalization of the above inequalities, as M(b − a) is the integral of the constant
function with value M over [a, b]. In addition, if the inequality between functions is strict,
then the inequality between integrals is also strict. That is, if f(x) < g(x) for each x in [a, b],
then
Subintervals. If [c, d] is a subinterval of [a, b] and f (x) is non-negative for all x, then
Products and absolute values of functions. If f and g are two functions, then we may
consider their [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_product"] pointwise products and powers, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value"] absolute values:
If f is Riemann-integrable on [a, b] then the same is true for |f|, and
Moreover, if f and g are both Riemann-integrable then fg is also Riemann-integrable, and
 This inequality, known as the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, plays a prominent role in Hilbert
 space theory, where the left hand side is interpreted as the inner product of two square-
integrable functions f and g on the interval [a, b].
Hölder's inequality.[32] Suppose that p and q are two real numbers, 1 ≤ p, q ≤ ∞ with
1
p 
+ 1
q 
= 1, and f and g are two Riemann-integrable functions. Then the functions |f|p and
|g|q are also integrable and the following [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6lder%27s_inequality"] Hölder's inequality holds:
For p = q = 2, Hölder's inequality becomes the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality.
Minkowski inequality.[32] Suppose that p ≥ 1 is a real number and f and g are Riemann-
integrable functions. Then | f |p, | g |p and | f + g |p are also Riemann-integrable and the
following [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_inequality"] Minkowski inequality holds:
An analogue of this inequality for Lebesgue integral is used in construction of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space"] Lp spaces.
Conventions
In this section, f is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"] real-valued Riemann-integrable function. The integral
Page 11
over an interval [a, b] is defined if a < b. This means that the upper and lower sums of the function f are
evaluated on a partition a = x0 ≤ x1 ≤ . . . ≤ xn = b whose values xi are increasing. Geometrically, this
signifies that integration takes place "left to right", evaluating f within intervals [x i , x i +1] where an
interval with a higher index lies to the right of one with a lower index. The values a and b, the end-points
of the interval, are called the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limits_of_integration"] limits of integration of f. Integrals can also be defined if a > b:[17]
With a = b, this implies:
The first convention is necessary in consideration of taking integrals over subintervals of [a, b]; the second
says that an integral taken over a degenerate interval, or a point, should be zero. One reason for the first
convention is that the integrability of f on an interval [a, b] implies that f is integrable on any subinterval
[c, d], but in particular integrals have the property that if c is any [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_(mathematics)"] element of [a, b], then:[29]
With the first convention, the resulting relation
is then well-defined for any cyclic permutation of a, b, and c.
Fundamental theorem of calculus
The fundamental theorem of calculus is the statement that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"] differentiation and integration are inverse
operations: if a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"] continuous function is first integrated and then differentiated, the original function is
retrieved.[33] An important consequence, sometimes called the second fundamental theorem of calculus,
allows one to compute integrals by using an antiderivative of the function to be integrated.[34]
First theorem
Let f be a continuous real-valued function defined on a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)#Terminology"] closed interval [a, b]. Let F be the function
defined, for all x in [a, b], by
Page 12
Then, F is continuous on [a, b], differentiable on the open interval (a, b), and
for all x in (a, b).
Second theorem
Let f be a real-valued function defined on a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_interval"] closed interval [a, b] that admits an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiderivative"] antiderivative F on [a, b].
That is, f and F are functions such that for all x in [a, b],
If f is integrable on [a, b] then
Extensions
Improper integrals
A "proper" Riemann integral assumes the integrand is defined and
finite on a closed and bounded interval, bracketed by the limits of
integration. An improper integral occurs when one or more of these
conditions is not satisfied. In some cases such integrals may be
 defined by considering the limit of a sequence of proper Riemann
integrals on progressively larger intervals.
If the interval is unbounded, for instance at its upper end, then the
improper integral is the limit as that endpoint goes to infinity:[35]
If the integrand is only defined or finite on a half-open interval, for
instance (a, b], then again a limit may provide a finite result:[36] 
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improper_integral"] improper integral 
has
unbounded intervals for both domain
and range.
That is, the improper integral is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)"] limit of proper integrals as one endpoint of the interval of integration
approaches either a specified [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"] real number, or ∞, or −∞. In more complicated cases, limits are required at
both endpoints, or at interior points.
Multiple integration
Page 13
Just as the definite integral of a positive function of one variable
represents the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"] area of the region between the graph of the function
and the x-axis, the double integral of a positive function of two
variables represents the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume"] volume of the region between the surface
defined by the function and the plane that contains its domain.[37]
For example, a function in two dimensions depends on two real
variables, x and y, and the integral of a function f over the rectangle
R given as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product"] Cartesian product of two intervals
can be written
where the differential dA indicates that integration is taken with
 respect to area. This double integral can be defined using Riemann
sums, and represents the (signed) volume under the graph of
z = f(x,y) over the domain R.[38] Under suitable conditions (e.g., if
f is continuous), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fubini%27s_theorem"] Fubini's theorem states that this integral can be
expressed as an equivalent iterated integral[39] 
Double integral computes volume
under a surface
This reduces the problem of computing a double integral to computing one-dimensional integrals. Because
of this, another notation for the integral over R uses a double integral sign:[38]
Integration over more general domains is possible. The integral of a function f, with respect to volume, over
an n-dimensional region D of  is denoted by symbols such as:
Line integrals and surface integrals
The concept of an integral can be extended to more general
domains of integration, such as curved lines and surfaces inside
higher-dimensional spaces. Such integrals are known as line
integrals and surface integrals respectively. These have important
applications in physics, as when dealing with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field"] vector fields.
A line integral (sometimes called a path integral) is an integral
where the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"] function to be integrated is evaluated along a curve.[40]
Various different line integrals are in use. In the case of a closed
curve it is also called a contour integral.
The function to be integrated may be a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field"] scalar field or a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field"] vector field.
The value of the line integral is the sum of values of the field at all
points on the curve, weighted by some scalar function on the curve 
A line integral sums together
elements along a curve.
Page 14
(commonly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length"] arc length or, for a vector field, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inner_product_space"] scalar product of the vector field with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_(infinitesimal)"] differential vector in
the curve).[41] This weighting distinguishes the line integral from simpler integrals defined on intervals.
Many simple formulas in physics have natural continuous analogs in terms of line integrals; for example,
the fact that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_work"] work is equal to force, F, multiplied by displacement, s, may be expressed (in terms of vector
quantities) as:[42]
For an object moving along a path C in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field"] vector field F such as an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_field"] electric field or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_field"] gravitational field, the
total work done by the field on the object is obtained by summing up the differential work done in moving
from s to s + ds. This gives the line integral[43]
A surface integral generalizes double integrals to integration over a
 surface (which may be a curved set in space); it can be thought of
as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_integral"] double integral analog of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral"] line integral. The function to be
integrated may be a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_field"] scalar field or a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_field"] vector field. The value of the
surface integral is the sum of the field at all points on the surface.
This can be achieved by splitting the surface into surface elements,
which provide the partitioning for Riemann sums.[44]
For an example of applications of surface integrals, consider a
vector field v on a surface S; that is, for each point x in S, v(x) is a
vector. Imagine that a fluid flows through S,  such that v(x)
determines the velocity of the fluid at x. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux"] flux is defined as the 
The definition of surface integral
relies on splitting the surface into
small surface elements.
quantity of fluid flowing through S in unit amount of time. To find
the flux, one need to take the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product"] dot product of v with the unit [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry)"] surface normal to S at each point, which will
give a scalar field, which is integrated over the surface:[45]
The fluid flux in this example may be from a physical fluid such as water or air, or from electrical or
magnetic flux. Thus surface integrals have applications in physics, particularly with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_theory"] classical theory of
electromagnetism.
Contour integrals
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis"] complex analysis, the integrand is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex-valued_function"] complex-valued function of a complex variable z instead of a real
function of a real variable x. When a complex function is integrated along a curve in the complex plane,
the integral is denoted as follows
This is known as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contour_integral"] contour integral.
Integrals of differential forms
Page 15
A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_form"] differential form is a mathematical concept in the fields of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariable_calculus"] multivariable calculus, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_topology"] differential topology,
and tensors. Differential forms are organized by degree. For example, a one-form is a weighted sum of the
differentials of the coordinates, such as:
where E, F, G are functions in three dimensions. A differential one-form can be integrated over an oriented
path, and the resulting integral is just another way of writing a line integral. Here the basic differentials dx,
dy, dz measure infinitesimal oriented lengths parallel to the three coordinate axes.
A differential two-form is a sum of the form
Here the basic two-forms  measure oriented areas parallel to the coordinate
two-planes. The symbol denotes the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_product"] wedge product, which is similar to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product"] cross product in the sense
that the wedge product of two forms representing oriented lengths represents an oriented area. A two-form
can be integrated over an oriented surface, and the resulting integral is equivalent to the surface integral
giving the flux of  .
Unlike the cross product, and the three-dimensional vector calculus, the wedge product and the calculus of
differential forms makes sense in arbitrary dimension and on more general manifolds (curves, surfaces, and
their higher-dimensional analogs). The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exterior_derivative"] exterior derivative plays the role of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"] gradient and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curl_(mathematics)"] curl of vector
calculus, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes%27_theorem"] Stokes' theorem simultaneously generalizes the three theorems of vector calculus: the
 divergence theorem, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green%27s_theorem"] Green's theorem, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin-Stokes_theorem"] Kelvin-Stokes theorem.
Summations
The discrete equivalent of integration is summation. Summations and integrals can be put on the same
foundations using the theory of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebesgue_integral"] Lebesgue integrals or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-scale_calculus"] time-scale calculus.
Functional integrals
An integration that is performed not over a variable (or, in physics, over a space or time dimension), but
over a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_space"] space of functions, is referred to as a functional integral.
Applications
Integrals are used extensively in many areas. For example, in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory"] probability theory, integrals are used to
determine the probability of some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_variable"] random variable falling within a certain range.[46] Moreover, the integral
under an entire [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function"] probability density function must equal 1, which provides a test of whether a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"] function with
no negative values could be a density function or not.[47]
Integrals can be used for computing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area"] area of a two-dimensional region that has a curved boundary, as
well as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_integral"] computing the volume of a three-dimensional object that has a curved boundary. The area of a two-
dimensional region can be calculated using the aforementioned definite integral.[48] The volume of a three-
dimensional object such as a disc or washer can be computed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_integration"] disc integration using the equation for the
volume of a cylinder, , where is the radius. In the case of a simple disc created by rotating a curve
about the x-axis, the radius is given by f(x), and its height is the differential dx. Using an integral with
bounds a and b, the volume of the disc is equal to:[49]
Page 16
Integrals are also used in physics, in areas like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinematics"] kinematics to find quantities like displacement, time, and
velocity. For example, in rectilinear motion, the displacement of an object over the time interval is
given by:
where is the velocity expressed as a function of time.[50] The work done by a force
function of position) from an initial position to a final position is:[51] 
(given as a
Integrals are also used in thermodynamics, where [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamic_integration"] thermodynamic integration is used to calculate the
difference in free energy between two given states.
Computation
Analytical
 The most basic technique for computing definite integrals of one real variable is based on the fundamental
theorem of calculus. Let f(x) be the function of x to be integrated over a given interval [a, b]. Then, find
an antiderivative of f; that is, a function F such that F′ = f on the interval. Provided the integrand and
integral have no [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_singularity"] singularities on the path of integration, by the fundamental theorem of calculus,
Sometimes it is necessary to use one of the many techniques that have been developed to evaluate integrals.
Most of these techniques rewrite one integral as a different one which is hopefully more tractable.
 Techniques include integration by substitution, integration by parts, integration by trigonometric
substitution, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_fractions_in_integration"] integration by partial fractions.
Alternative methods exist to compute more complex integrals. Many [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonelementary_integral"] nonelementary integrals can be
expanded in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series"] Taylor series and integrated term by term. Occasionally, the resulting infinite series can be
summed analytically. The method of convolution using [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meijer_G-function"] Meijer G-functions can also be used, assuming that
the integrand can be written as a product of Meijer G-functions. There are also many less common ways of
calculating definite integrals; for instance, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parseval%27s_identity"] Parseval's identity can be used to transform an integral over a
rectangular region into an infinite sum. Occasionally, an integral can be evaluated by a trick; for an example
of this, see [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral"] Gaussian integral.
 Computations of volumes of solids of revolution can usually be done with disk integration or shell
integration.
Specific results which have been worked out by various techniques are collected in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_integrals"] list of integrals.
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)"]
Page 17
Symbolic
Many problems in mathematics, physics, and engineering involve integration where an explicit formula for
the integral is desired. Extensive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_integrals"] tables of integrals have been compiled and published over the years for
this purpose. With the spread of computers, many professionals, educators, and students have turned to
 computer algebra systems that are specifically designed to perform difficult or tedious tasks, including
integration. Symbolic integration has been one of the motivations for the development of the first such
systems, like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macsyma"] Macsyma and Maple.
A major mathematical difficulty in symbolic integration is that in many cases, a relatively simple function
does not have integrals that can be expressed in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_expression"] closed form involving only [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_function"] elementary functions, include
 rational and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function"] exponential functions, logarithm, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions"] trigonometric functions and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions"] inverse trigonometric functions,
and the operations of multiplication and composition. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risch_algorithm"] Risch algorithm provides a general criterion to
determine whether the antiderivative of an elementary function is elementary, and to compute it if it is.
However, functions with closed expressions of antiderivatives are the exception, and consequently,
computerized algebra systems have no hope of being able to find an antiderivative for a randomly
constructed elementary function. On the positive side, if the 'building blocks' for antiderivatives are fixed in
advance, it may still be possible to decide whether the antiderivative of a given function can be expressed
using these blocks and operations of multiplication and composition, and to find the symbolic answer
 whenever it exists. The Risch algorithm, implemented in Mathematica, Maple and other computer algebra
systems, does just that for functions and antiderivatives built from rational functions, radicals, logarithm,
and exponential functions.
Some special integrands occur often enough to warrant special study. In particular, it may be useful to have,
in the set of antiderivatives, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_functions"] special functions (like the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre_function"] Legendre functions, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergeometric_function"] hypergeometric function,
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function"] gamma function, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_gamma_function"] incomplete gamma function and so on). Extending the Risch's algorithm to include
such functions is possible but challenging and has been an active research subject.
 More recently a new approach has emerged, using D-finite functions, which are the solutions of linear
differential equations with polynomial coefficients. Most of the elementary and special functions are D-
finite, and the integral of a D-finite function is also a D-finite function. This provides an algorithm to
express the antiderivative of a D-finite function as the solution of a differential equation. This theory also
allows one to compute the definite integral of a D-function as the sum of a series given by the first
coefficients, and provides an algorithm to compute any coefficient.
Numerical
 Definite integrals may be approximated using several methods of numerical integration. The rectangle
method relies on dividing the region under the function into a series of rectangles corresponding to function
values and multiplies by the step width to find the sum. A better approach, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoidal_rule"] trapezoidal rule, replaces the
rectangles used in a Riemann sum with trapezoids. The trapezoidal rule weights the first and last values by
one half, then multiplies by the step width to obtain a better approximation.[52] The idea behind the
trapezoidal rule, that more accurate approximations to the function yield better approximations to the
integral, can be carried further: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule"] Simpson's rule approximates the integrand by a piecewise quadratic
function.[53]
Riemann sums, the trapezoidal rule, and Simpson's rule are examples of a family of quadrature rules called
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%E2%80%93Cotes_formulas"] Newton–Cotes formulas. The degree n Newton–Cotes quadrature rule approximates the polynomial on
each subinterval by a degree n polynomial. This polynomial is chosen to interpolate the values of the
function on the interval.[54] Higher degree Newton–Cotes approximations can be more accurate, but they
 require more function evaluations, and they can suffer from numerical inaccuracy due to Runge's
Page 18
 phenomenon. One solution to this problem is Clenshaw–Curtis
quadrature, in which the integrand is approximated by expanding it
in terms of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials"] Chebyshev polynomials.
 Romberg's method halves the step widths incrementally, giving
trapezoid approximations denoted by T(h0), T(h1), and so on,
where hk+1 is half of hk. For each new step size, only half the new
function values need to be computed; the others carry over from the
previous size. It then [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation"] interpolate a polynomial through the
approximations, and extrapolate to T(0).  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature"] Gaussian quadrature
 evaluates the function at the roots of a set of orthogonal
polynomials.[55] An n-point Gaussian method is exact for
polynomials of degree up to 2n − 1.
The computation of higher-dimensional integrals (for example,
volume calculations) makes important use of such alternatives as
 Monte Carlo integration.[56]

quadrature
Mechanical
The area of an arbitrary two-dimensional shape can be determined using a measuring instrument called
planimeter. The volume of irregular objects can be measured with precision by the fluid [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(fluid)"] displaced as the
object is submerged.
Geometrical
Area can sometimes be found via [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical"] geometrical [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass-and-straightedge_construction"] compass-and-straightedge constructions of an equivalent
square.
Integration by differentiation
Kempf, Jackson and Morales demonstrated mathematical relations that allow an integral to be calculated by
means of differentiation. Their calculus involves the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function"] Dirac delta function and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_derivative"] partial derivative operator
 .  This can also be applied to functional integrals, allowing them to be computed by functional
differentiation.[57]
Examples
Using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus"] fundamental theorem of calculus allows for straightforward calculations of basic functions.
