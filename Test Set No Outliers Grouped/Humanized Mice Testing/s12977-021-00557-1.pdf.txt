Abstract 
Humanized mice model human disease and as such are used commonly for research studies of infectious, degenera-
tive and cancer disorders. Recent models also reflect hematopoiesis, natural immunity, neurobiology, and molecular
pathways that influence disease pathobiology. A spectrum of immunodeficient mouse strains permit long-lived
human progenitor cell engraftments. The presence of both innate and adaptive immunity enables high levels of
human hematolymphoid reconstitution with cell susceptibility to a broad range of microbial infections. These mice
also facilitate investigations of human pathobiology, natural disease processes and therapeutic efficacy in a broad
spectrum of human disorders. However, a bridge between humans and mice requires a complete understanding of
pathogen dose, co-morbidities, disease progression, environment, and genetics which can be mirrored in these mice. 
These must be considered for understanding of microbial susceptibility, prevention, and disease progression. With
known common limitations for access to human tissues, evaluation of metabolic and physiological changes and limi-
tations in large animal numbers, studies in mice prove important in planning human clinical trials. To these ends, this
review serves to outline how humanized mice can be used in viral and pharmacologic research emphasizing both
current and future studies of viral and neurodegenerative diseases. In all, humanized mouse provides cost-effective, 
high throughput studies of infection or degeneration in natural pathogen host cells, and the ability to test transmis-
sion and eradication of disease.
Introduction
Rodents are the most common animal used in biomedi-
cal research laboratories. This is driven largely by low
cost, small size, ease of housing, maintenance, large lit-
ter sizes and availability of inbred strains. For infectious
diseases these animals can be used to study pathogen cell
and tissue tropisms, replication, and virulence. Moreo-
ver, advances in disease pathogenesis, pharmacologic and
vaccine research serves to mitigate the health burden of
not simply infectious disease but also metabolic, cancer-
ous, and degenerative disorders [1, 2].  Animal models

susceptible human host. Such criteria are imperative for
any United States Food and Drug Administration approv-
als, when and where vaccines and therapeutics cannot
ethically be tested on humans. These enable final approv-
als which can only be made after preclinical tests are
completed. The most relevant models’ rests in the field of
infectious diseases, as many of the studied pathogens are
human specific. To such ends, several studies of infec-
tious pathogens can only be completed using humanized
mice. Examples include studies of Neisseria meningitides, 
and when conducted in humanized mice display specific-
ity to human microvessels and induce vascular leakage
and tissue necrosis [3]. Leishmania major provides yet
another example as infection can proceed in human mac-
rophages with secondary adaptive T cell responses [4].
Human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) demonstrate pro-
ductive infection and expansion of virus specific CD4 + T
cells [5].  Virus-specific immune responses have also
been observed in these humanized mice. Dengue virus
infection occurs in the spleen, bone marrow, and liver
of humanized mice and these animals develop human
disease-like signs and symptoms that include fever, apa-
thy, rash, and weight loss [6, 7]. Likewise, Epstein Barr
virus (EBV) or human herpes simplex virus type 4 (HHV-
4) and its associated lymphoproliferative disorders and
tumor development are reflected in humanized mice
[8].  Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, or HHV-
8, leads to persistent latent infection of B cells and mac-
rophages within spleen of humanized mice with viral
dissemination to the skin [9]. HHV-2 infections show T
and natural killer (NK) cell responses, antibody responses
and ongoing viral replication in humanized mice [10].
Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) or HHV-5 can read-
ily be detected in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow of
humanized mice [11].  John Cunningham (JC) virus is
well studied in humanized mice demonstrating periph-
eral and central nervous system infection [12, 13]. Sal-
monella enterica, the causative agent of typhoid fever in
humans, can also be investigated in humanized mice [14].
Tuberculosis infections were mirrored in these mice and
demonstrate CD4 + T cell and macrophage-dependent
granuloma-like structure formation after infection [15].
Further treatment with cytokines like, granulocyte mac-
rophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in these
animals demonstrate infection control [15]. Other human
diseases such as influenza, Ebola, Hanta virus pulmonary
syndrome (HPS), malaria, and sepsis, have been studied
using different models of humanized mice, and insights
have been gained regarding their severity, transmission
and therapeutic efficacy [16].
Other examples of viral and non-viral diseases stud-
ied in humanized mice include the human immuno-
deficiency virus type one (HIV-1) [17],  severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [18],
influenza [19], Zika (ZIKV) [20], hepatitis C (HCV) [21],
dengue viruses [19] and malaria [22, 23]. These studies
were possible after the research community overcame
the limitations imposed by grafting human tissues. Mice
lacking a functional adaptive immune system such as the
severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) or recom-
bination activating gene 1 (RAG-1) knock-out become
permissive to engraftment of human immune cells from
human solid organ tissues or cord blood [24].  At the
same time, removal of mouse genes like common gamma
chain of the interleukin-2 receptor enabled the models to
reflect multiple aspects of the human innate and adap-
tive immune response [16, 17, 25]. In the early 2000s, the
development of immunodeficient mice bearing muta-
tions in the IL-2 receptor gamma chain (IL2rgnull) proved
to be a breakthrough in humanized mouse develop-
ment [26]. The common gamma chain (γC
) represents an
important component of receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, 
IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21, and is crucial for the signaling of
human cytokines. The attenuation of cell cytokine sign-
aling pathways by γC 
which are involved in the survival, 
differentiation, and function of lymphocytes impairs the
development of the mouse lymphoid system. In combi-
nation with either protein kinase DNA activated catalytic
polypeptide mutation (Prkdcscid or scid), or with Rag 1 or
2 (Rag1null or Rag2 null) mutations, adaptive immunity is
depleted. These mice also exhibit deficiencies of innate
immunity and lack murine NK cells [26].
New therapeutic agents and preventive strategies
require in-depth understanding of disease pathobiology. 
Appropriate model systems are also required for testing
the safety and efficacy of disease preventative measures
[27, 28]. Selection of a model to mimic disease is driven
by physiologic linkages to humans, ease of use, repro-
ducibility, safety, and cost [27]. Due to limitations asso-
ciated with non-human primates (NHPs) that include
expense, availability, time, and genetic limitations, there
is a need for small animal models as human surrogates
[29, 30].  Rodent experiments can assess study repro-
ducibility while controlling host genetics in response to
the pathogen or to the disease [28]. Although medically
relevant pathogens can cause disease in inbred mouse
strains, pathogens such as ZIKA virus, measles virus, 
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-
CoV),  human norovirus, and Crimean-Congo hemor-
rhagic fever viruses do not produce disease in mouse
strains [20, 31, 32].  Notably, the genetic differences
between mice and humans interfere with a pathogen’s
ability to elicit human-like disease outcomes in rodents
[33–35]. To overcome these limitations, humanized mice
were developed to study host–pathogen interactions. 
Herein, we focus first on new models of humanized mice
Page 3

then evaluate their use to study infectious, neurodegen-
erative, and inflammatory diseases and therapeutics. We
also propose new models and extend the utility ranges of
existing ones.
Human cell‑grafted mice
In cases where mice are not permissive to microbial
infection an alternative is “genetically-modified” mice
that can be made by the introduction of human-specific
genes or engrafting human organs or cells [16, 25, 36, 
37]. Mice cannot be used to study hepatitis B and C virus
(HBV and HCV),  herpes viruses and/or HIV-1 where
several genes regulate host range, and thus preclude
expression of factors that fully recapitulate and promote
disease [38]. Another factor that limits the use of rodent
models to recapitulate human disease is in differences
between host immune responses [16]. This leads to limi-
tations in engraftment efficiency with high rates of tis-
sue rejection. Both reflect common deficiencies to fully
recapitulate antigen-specific immune responses [16].
Despite such limitations, human intestinal xenografted
mice have been used successfully to support Entamoeba
histolytica infections [25, 39]. These model systems can
facilitate studies of pathogen interactions with human
cells and tissues [40] serving as important pre-clinical
tools for biomedical research [24, 29, 30, 41]. As of today, 
the three most widely used immunodeficient strains are
NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl (NSG),  NODShi.Cg-Prkdc-
scidIl2rgtm1Sug (NOG),  and C;129S4- Rag2tm1FlvIl2rgtm1Flv 
(commonly referred to as BALB/c-Rag2null IL2rgnull mice
or BRG) mice [29, 30, 41].
NSG and BRG mice lack the γC
, whereas NOG mice
have a truncated cytoplasmic domain of the gamma
chain that binds to cytokines but lacks the signaling
domain. These can be deployed for study using four gen-
eral approaches to engraft a human immune system. 
The first model is the human peripheral blood leukocyte
(PBL) severe immune deficiency (Hu-PBL-SCID) model
which is generated by injection of human PBLs, where
rapid engraftment of human CD3 + T cells occurs within
one week. The model allows transient studies of human
T cell function limited by the development of xenoge-
neic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [24]. The second
model is the bone marrow/liver/thymus “BLT” model. 
This is generated by transplantation of human fetal liver
and thymus under the kidney capsule and concurrent
intravenous injection of autologous fetal liver hemat-
opoietic stem cells (HSCs) [42, 43]. All lineages of human
hematopoietic cells are developed, and the model sup-
ports a robust mucosal immune system. Human T-cells
are educated in an autologous human thymus and are
HLA-restricted. Despite these advantages, there are two
major drawbacks including GVHD-like reactions [29, 
30, 44] and limitations in obtaining fetal cells to gener-
ate the model. The third model is through the injection
of human CD34 + HSCs derived from bone marrow
(BM),  umbilical cord blood, fetal liver, or granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized periph-
eral blood. This model possesses BM-generated T cells, 
B cells, antigen-presenting cells (APCs),  and myeloid
cells, but are found at low levels. The human T cells are
educated in mouse thymus and are H2 type, not HLA-
restricted [45]. The fourth model is generated by intrahe-
patic injection of human CD34 + HSCs from human cord
blood [26]. This model supports engraftment of a com-
plete human immune system which lasts for more than
one year with limited GVHD and is the most widely used
due to reduced manipulation of the mice during their
generation. The only disadvantage of this model is that
the human T cells are educated in murine thymus and
have functionally underdeveloped lymphatic tissues [46].
Despite these limitations humanized mice are commonly
utilized as translational models in regenerative medicine, 
transplantation immunity, infectious disease research
and for cancer biology and therapeutics.
HIV‑1 infection, pathogenesis, prevention, 
and antiretroviral testing
Species specificity of HIV initially precluded the use of
mouse models for HIV infection; however, mice trans-
planted with functional human immune system (HIS) 
became a highly versatile and cost-effective model to
study HIV-1 disease. Employment of humanized mice for
HIV infection started when SCID mice were discovered
[47]. Improvements in SCID mice strains have been made
by refining the compatibility of mouse innate immune
environment to allow human grafts. This has made it
possible to have long-term reconstitution of the human
immune system that supports chronic HIV infection. 
Humanized mice can induce adaptive immune responses
and have been used, in measure, for vaccine testing [47, 
48]. However, the human IgG responses are limited. This
has been overcome by employing immunodeficient mice
of different backgrounds with HSCs with thymus/liver
tissue implants to generate BLT mice [49, 50]. Different
human immune cell subset distribution in blood and lym-
phoid tissues allows BLT mice to be susceptible to HIV-1
infection. These mice can be infected through natural
vaginal, rectal, or intravenous routes and used to study
HIV-1 biology (viral entry, replication and spread), virus-
induced immunopathology ­(CD4+ T-cell depletion and
immune activation), mucosal inflammation, and cellular
viral tropism [51–54]. HIV-1 reservoirs can also be estab-
lished in infected humanized mice after treatment with
combinations of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), thereby pro-
viding a model to test new therapies for viral treatment

and prevention. These mice can also be used to test how
best to interrupt viral integration, activation, and replica-
tion [55, 56]. Recently our group employed humanized
mice to examine tissue viral reservoirs and to recapitulate
latent HIV-1 in vivo [57, 58]. These works demonstrated
that mature macrophages are a cell reservoir in antiret-
roviral therapy (ART)-suppressed HIV-infected human-
ized mice [59]. Mice infected with HIV and treated with
combination ART achieved complete viral suppression
in the peripheral blood, and immune cells were sorted
into T lymphocyte subsets and macrophages to quantify
HIV RNA and DNA. While CD4 + memory cells were
the principal T cell reservoir, integrated HIV-1 DNA was
detected in the bone marrow and spleen macrophages. 
These findings were affirmed in humanized myeloid only
mice (MoM) [60].
Existing antiviral medicines are designed to block
essential steps of the virus life cycle. To gain access into
the host cell, virus particles adsorb and bind to the CD4
and CCR5 or CXCR4 receptor and co-receptor proteins
present on the host cell surface. Agents that block these
interactions have been developed into effective drugs
against HIV-1 [61]. Other antiviral drug targets include
ion channel blockers or inhibitors of structural and non-
structural viral proteins, reverse transcriptase enzyme, 
integrase, protease, and neuraminidase enzymes that cat-
alyze polyprotein cleavage and release of mature virions. 
However, notable limitations include the narrow spec-
trum nature of the compounds, suboptimal adherence
to daily regimens, poor bioavailability, drug resistance, 
and associated toxicities. The available antiviral agents
are also virus-specific with only a few exhibiting broad-
spectrum antiviral activities [62].  While development
of broad-spectrum antivirals may seem to offer attrac-
tive alternatives to conventional target-specific antiviral
drugs, their development into drug candidates has been
hampered by either poor efficacy or toxicity concerns
[63].  Limitations in delivery and failure to maintain
therapeutic drug concentrations at sites of viral replica-
tion have also negatively impacted therapeutic outcomes. 
The absence of vaccines for chronic viral infections such
as HIV and HCV has led to growing interest in long-act-
ing (LA) formulations and devices aimed at improving
patient adherence to therapy to minimize emergence of
drug resistance [64, 65].
Humanized mice have been used to test newly devel-
oped and LA ART, neutralizing antibody, immuno-
therapeutic, latency re-activating agents, and viral
gene editing strategies [17, 66, 67]. An example is the
drug 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine (EFdA),  a
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) that
was developed in BLT mice. Works demonstrated that 
EFdA monotherapy was able to suppress viral replica-
tion [68]. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) studies with
EFdA prevented HIV-1 vaginal and oral transmission
in BLT mice. Other LA ART studies were developed
of medicines administered once a month. LA nano-
formulated integrase inhibitor raltegravir protected
humanized mice from repeated high-dose vaginal HIV
challenges in a PrEP study [69]. Our own laboratories
created LA nanoformulated protease inhibitors then
tested them in humanized mice [70]. Nanoformulated
atazanavir and ritonavir (nanoATV/r) combination
suppressed plasma viral load below the detection level
after six weekly doses, and ART cessation resulted
in immediate viral rebound [71].  We also decorated
nanoATV/r with folic acid for cell-specific targeting
and uptake, and three doses given once every other
week significantly improved viral suppression in chron-
ically infected humanized mice compared to untar-
geted nanoATV/r [72, 73]. Next, we developed state of
the art LA slow effective release (LASER) ART using
prodrug technology with the ability to prevent or sup-
press HIV infection for a prolonged period after a sin-
gle dose administration. New generation LASER ART
formulations of cabotegravir and dolutegravir (CAB
and DTG) could prevent and suppress HIV infection. 
Nanoformulated myristoylated CAB (NMCAB) after a
single 45 mg/kg intramuscular injection, had pharma-
cokinetic (PK) profiles that were 4 times greater than
that recorded for parenteral CAB. In mice, NMCAB
showed significantly higher drug concentration up to
one year after one IM injection as compared to cur-
rent parenteral CAB formulations [74].  A hydropho-
bic and lipophilic modified DTG prodrug encapsulated
into poloxamer nanoformulations protected human-
ized mice from the parenteral challenge of HIV-1 for
two weeks [75]. Newer formulations of CAB prodrug
nanoformulations have increased the apparent half-
life of the drug to one year [76].  Humanized mouse
models also demonstrate the antiviral effectiveness
of broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies [46].  It has
been shown that a combination of antibodies can sup-
press viremia below the limit of detection and target
the HIV-1 reservoir. Moreover, passively administered
antibodies and vector-mediated expression of broadly
neutralizing antibodies protect humanized mice from
HIV-1 infection [77]. The mouse models also provide a
potential bridge to predict immunotherapeutic-related
cytokine release syndrome and development of HIV-1
cure strategies. PBLs from patients can be engrafted in
adult immunosuppressed mice to study the response to
immunotherapies, like anti-CD3, anti-CD28, Keytruda, 
anti-thymocyte globulin, and a TGN1412 analog.

NeuroHIV and humanized mice
Soon after the discovery of HIV, it was found that mon-
onuclear phagocytes (MP; monocytes, macrophages, 
microglia, and dendritic cells) are the principal viral tar-
gets within the central nervous system (CNS) [78]. HIV
enters the brain during early stages of HIV infection, and
the infected monocyte-macrophage act as Trojan horses
in viral spread within the CNS [79]. For HIV-1 disease
in the brain, MPs serve as viral reservoirs and inducers
of end-organ disease and are the drivers of HIV-1 asso-
ciated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), a clinical dis-
ease complex prevalent in up to 50% of infected people
[80]. Introduction of ART has been effective in suppress-
ing viral replication and reducing the severity of cogni-
tive, motor, and behavioral impairments [81]. The virus
persists in a latent form, and neither ART nor the host
antiviral cellular and humoral immunity could eliminate
infection leading to milder forms of memory impair-
ments [82, 83]. Virus-induced MP functions lead to the
production of cell and viral toxins that reflect an aber-
rant secretory immune response and persistent low-level
infection [84].  Neuroinflammation through persistent
glial infection and activation has emerged as a signature
phenotype of HAND. Understanding the underlying
molecular and cellular mechanisms in HAND pathology
and viral persistence is essential to develop therapeu-
tic strategies for HAND and for HIV elimination from
CNS. While studies of the simian Immunodeficiency
virus (SIV) have contributed to the current knowledge of
HAND, the need for more scalable and affordable mod-
els lead to the initial development of a mouse model of
neuroHIV in the 1990s [85].  Since HIV-infected MPs
are the major drivers of HAND-associated pathology, 
human virus-infected monocyte-derived macrophages
were injected intracerebrally into the caudate-putamen
of immunodeficient mice [52, 86, 87]. Several important
aspects of HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE, the pathological
equivalent of advanced virus-associated cognitive dys-
function) such as multinucleated giant cell pathology, 
activated microglia and astrocytes, myelin pallor, and
dendritic loss were observed. Moreover, behavioral, and
cognitive abnormalities in the HIVE mice were associ-
ated with neuronal dysfunction and decreased synaptic
density. The HIVE mouse model has been used to test
anti-inflammatory, antiretroviral, or neuroprotective
therapeutic approaches [86]. Initial studies in this model
provided a direction in understanding efficient ART regi-
mens to suppress viral load in the HIV infected brain.
Further improvements to include the adaptive immune
component of HIV infection in neuroHIV was achieved
by the reconstitution of immunodeficient animals with
syngeneic human peripheral blood lymphocytes followed
by intracranial injection of HIV-1-infected macrophages 
resulted in cytotoxic antivirus T lymphocyte (CTL) 
response [88]. CD8-positive T cells migrated to the sites
of human macrophages leading to the cell-mediated
destruction of HIV-1 infected cells. Development of
HIVE mice reconstituted with a human immune system
enabled testing of immunomodulators that included
indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitors, peroxi-
some proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma, 
and cannabinoid 2 (CB2) receptor agonists [88].  The
major limitations of the HIVE mouse models are asso-
ciated with traumatic injury caused by the cell injec-
tions into the brain, focal neuropathology around the
injected area and an imperfect relationship between the
brain neuropathology and progressive systemic infec-
tion. Moreover, the HIVE and AIDS dementia complex
was prevalent during pre-ART era and modeling milder
forms of HAND requires mice that can be chronically
infected with HIV and with suppressive ART.
Mice reconstituted with human immune system
allowed to study chronic HIV infection, however, a limi-
tation in humanized mouse models involves the dis-
tribution of human cells in the brain. Human cells are
located mainly in the meninges; with very few in perivas-
cular areas and brain parenchyma. Moreover, human
microglial-like cells are rarely found in the mouse brain. 
HIV-infected human macrophages and lymphocytes are
mainly found in meninges and perivascular areas [87, 
89, 90]. Longitudinal non-invasive imaging studies using
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS) revealed progressive loss of neu-
ronal integrity, which correlated with gliosis and loss of
neuronal dendritic and synaptic proteins and myelin
[91]. Behavioral abnormalities such as memory loss and
anxiety were also observed in HIV-1 infected humanized
mice [91]. HIV related behavioral deficits were mostly
studied in non-humanized rodent models, including HIV
transgenic rodents [92–97] and EcoHIV infected mice
[98–100].
Humanized MoM reconstituted with human myeloid
and B cells, but no T cells, showed productive infection
of HIV-1 in MPs and led to the viral seeding in CNS by
infected MPs [60]. Presence of both classical and inter-
mediate macrophages were observed in the brains of
MoM, but the lack of human microglia limited produc-
tive brain infection. In a humanized T cell only mouse, T
cells could also establish and maintain HIV infection in
the CNS [101]. Nonetheless, in all the humanized mouse
models, HIV brain infection is minimal due to the limited
number of human cells [102].
As noted, MPs are the major cellular targets for HIV-1
in brain, human astrocytes can be infected but at very low
levels [103, 104]. Both microglia and astrocytes contrib-
ute to the CNS viral reservoir and neuroinflammation.

To utilize the humanized mice for neuroHIV studies, the
presence of human glia in the mouse brain along with
the human immune system are necessary. The ability to
reconstitute the murine brain with functional human
glial cells would provide an opportunity to study HIV
induced inflammation, neuronal dysfunction, and viral
reservoirs in one system. Our laboratories generated
a humanized mouse model dually reconstituted with
human astrocytes and human leukocytes [105]. By trans-
planting human neuroprogenitor cells in the brain and
HSC in the liver simultaneously in a new-born mouse, led
to the development of human astrocytes and leukocytes. 
In these mice human glial-specific anti-viral response
was observed following systemic HIV infection, and the
neuropathogenesis was observed as downregulation of
mouse genes crucial for oligodendrocyte differentiation
and myelination, suggesting alterations in structure and
function of white matter. HIV brain infection was mini-
mal in this model, again restricted to macrophages and
lymphocytes in meninges, and very few perivascular
and parenchymal human leuokocytes, due to the lack
of human microglial reconstitution. To facilitate human
microglial differentiation in HSC-transplanted human-
ized mice, IL-34, a tissue specific ligand for colony stim-
ulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R),  was transgenically
introduced into immunodeficient mouse strain (Fig. 1).
IL-34 is important for human microglial and tissue mac-
rophage development. Human HSC reconstitution in
human IL-34 transgenic immune deficient mice lead to
the engraftment of a mouse brain with human microglia
that expressed canonical markers such as CD14, CD68, 
CD163, CD11b, ITGB2, CX3CR1, CSFR1, TREM2, and
P2RY12 [106]. Peripheral HIV infection led to productive
infection of human microglia with a significant number
of HIV-1 antigen positive cells distributed in all mouse
brain regions. Human-specific molecular signatures rep-
resentative of antiviral and neuroinflammatory responses
were detected. Transcripts for all viral proteins were
readily identified with the highest expression of HIV env, 
pol and nef. Further, neuropathological assessments dur-
ing HIV infection are under investigation. Our recent
studies using human microglia mouse model demon-
strated significant levels of HIV-1 DNA in the brain and
other lymphoid tissues even under combination ART
controlled viral infection supporting the establishment of
CNS viral reservoirs in mice. These improved humanized
glial mouse models permit investigations of neuroHIV
in presence of suppressive ART. Further studies of HIV
induced neuropathology and behavioral deficits in HIV
infected and ARV treated humanized microglial mice
will provide a better understanding of the human disease
and the underlying molecular mechanisms for successful
therapeutic development. This new model to study HIV 
Fig. 1  Development and characterization of humanized microglial
mice. Humanized microglia mice serve as tool to elucidate
neuroHIV pathobiology and to develop therapeutic and elimination
antiretroviral strategies for HIV infections. IL-34 was transgenically
introduced and at the same time CD34 + HSCs were injected into
the liver of immunodeficient newborn mice. These mice developed
a functional human lymphoid system comprised of B cells, T cells
and macrophages and brain enriched with human microglial
cells. Blue and red colored cells are human and mouse cells, 
respectively. In regards to the timing, human cells are introduced
after birth to reconstitute lymphoid and solid organ tissues devoid of
endogenous murine immunocytes. The human immunocytes show
limited number reductions with time after injection as new cells are
produced from progenitors. These exist, over time, less frequently in
brain and periphery compared to mouse cells
brain infection also aid in the development and testing of
new generation ART delivery with improved CNS bio-
availability and will be useful for future viral eradication
studies. Further, the model now allows studies of newly
emerging ART-induced neurotoxicity such as reported
for efavirenz [107, 108]. However, many laboratory and
animal studies have shown a number of direct effects
on neuronal and glial function along with pathological
outcomes that are linked to amyloid deposition, small
vessel damage and aberrations in chemical neurotrans-
mission [109–114]. Studies of macrophage function as
part of depot for sustained release agents are now possi-
ble with these newer humanized mouse models [59, 105, 
115–118]. Perhaps ever more important rests in the need
of vigorous behavioral testing which have been initiated
in the earlier models but remain underdeveloped in these
humanized microglial brain test systems [106, 119].

Hepatitis B
It is estimated that approximately two billion people
worldwide have evidence of past or present infection
with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and 257 million individuals
are chronic carriers (i.e., positive for hepatitis B surface
antigen [HBsAg]).  The rate of progression from acute
to chronic HBV infection (CHB) is approximately 90% 
for perinatally-acquired infection, however vaccination
has reduced the progression by 90% [120]. A significant
proportion of people living with HIV-1 are also infected
with HBV [121, 122].  However, the number of exist-
ing CHB patients exceed number of people living with
HIV-1 [64]. The progression of CHB leads to the devel-
opment of cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer [123].
CHB remains a significant burden on health care system
around the world and requires effective treatment to pre-
vent progression [21]. The goal for CHB patients is to
achieve a cure, however the complexity of the viral life
cycle and multiple mechanisms of avoidance of immune
responses cause complications. The formation of stable
covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) as a replica-
tion template of HBV also represents a significant chal-
lenge for elimination. The elimination of hepatocytes
with integrated HBV genome is immune mediated and
required for clearance of HBsAg. All steps in HBV life-
cycle are present in human hepatocytes, and humanized
mice are an instrumental tool to evaluate the efficacy
and safety of available therapeutics. Several models are
reported to humanize the mouse liver and establish HBV
infection [124].  Human liver chimeric mice are often
generated using the urokinase-type plasminogen activa-
tor transgene (uPA) and RAG-2 gene knockout (uPA/
RAG2−/−) mice[125];  uPA/SCID [126],  mice deficient
in the tyrosine catabolic enzyme fumarylacetoacetate
hydrolase ­(Fah−/−) on ­Rag2−/− interleukin 2 receptor
gamma chain knockout (­Il2rg−/−) mice (FRG) [127], and
herpes simplex virus type-1 thymidine kinase- NOD/
Shi-scid IL2r-gamma(null) NOG (TK-NOG) mice [128].
Different levels of liver humanization can be achieved in
these models and different strains of HBV (and hepatitis
delta virus) that can naturally infect human hepatocytes. 
The established chronic HBV viremia ­(105–1010 IU/mL
HBV DNA) and HBsAg stable expression presence in
circulation, are used to monitor treatment efficacy and
liver tissues for evaluation of cccDNA copies. The use of
chimeric mice for anti-HBV therapeutics are described in
detail [129].
Existing treatment of CHB is based on inhibition of
viral RNA reverse transcription to prevent replenish-
ment of cccDNA by nucleot(s)ides (NAs), which requires
a life-long administration of oral drugs with strong
adherence. Entecavir remains the most used oral thera-
peutic in humanized mice experimental combinatorial 
treatments [130].  LA lamivudine nanoformulation was
developed by our laboratories and tested on human-
ized mice. A single intramuscular injection of 75 mg/
kg reduced HBV DNA in peripheral blood for up to 2.5
log for 4 weeks [115]. The differences of HBV genotypes
and drug-resistant mutants (to entecavir and lamivu-
dine) susceptibility to 90 mg/kg body weight/day of TDF
for 3 weeks were tested on uPA/scid mice [131].  The
effects of NAs to inhibit reverse transcription and HBV
DNA synthesis and antiviral properties of IFN-α showing
enhanced cccDNA degradation were fully reproduced in
humanized liver mice [132]. IFN-α-mediated suppression
of HBsAg concentration and silencing of cccDNA was
extensively studied on uPA/scid and uPA/scid/IL2Rgc-/-
(USG) liver humanized mice [133, 134]. The effective new
approaches targeting HBsAg that tolerates the immune
system and support viral persistence were assessed in
humanized liver mice. ARB-1740 is a clinical stage RNA
interference agent composed of three siRNAs delivered
using lipid nanoparticle technology (LNP). A combina-
tion of ARB-1740 with a capsid inhibitor and pegylated
interferon-alpha led to greater liver HBsAg reduction
which correlated with more robust induction of innate
immune responses in cDNA-uPA/scid human chimeric
mouse model of HBV [135, 136].
The lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) containing HBsAg
silencing RNA were modified with a hepatocyte-specific
ligand, N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) and tested
on chimeric uPA/scid mice [137].  Modification of the
GalNAc-LNPs with polyethyleneglycol negated the
LNP-associated toxicity without any detectable loss of
gene silencing activity in hepatocytes. A single injection
of the modified LNPs resulted in a significant reduction
of HBV genomic DNA and their antigens [137]. Multi-
ple approaches targeting capsid proteins were tested on
chimeric humanized mice. For example, ciclopirox, a
synthetic antifungal agent, inhibits HBV capsid assem-
bly and secretion of HBV DNA in infected liver chimeric
uPA/scid mice alone or synergized by Tenofovir diso-
proxil fumarate (TDF) (six weeks orally) [138]. GLP-26, a
novel glyoxamide derivative that alters HBV nucleocapsid
assembly and prevents viral DNA replication, in combi-
natorial treatment with entecavir in a humanized mouse
model showed reduction in viral load and viral antigens, 
which was sustained for up to 12 weeks after treatment
cessation [139].  Humanized uPA/scid mice were also
used to evaluate NVR3-778, a capsid assembly modula-
tor, in combination with PEG-IFN, and showed positive
effect as compared with entecavir [140]. The adeno-asso-
ciated virus (AAV) vectors and CRISPR-Staphylococcus
aureus (Sa)Cas9 were used to edit the HBV genome in
liver-humanized FRG mice chronically infected with
HBV and treated with entecavir, which showed reduction
Page 8

in total liver HBV DNA and cccDNA [141]. Similar stud-
ies of anti-HBV effects of the AAV2-/WJ11-Cas9 system
in a uPA/scid humanized chimeric mouse model also
showed reduced HBV infection [142].
Humanized liver mice were also used to assess the effi-
cacy of cellular immune-mediated elimination of HBV
infected human hepatocytes. For example, transplanta-
tion of USG mice with human HLA-A2-positive hepato-
cytes enables testing of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated
activity. The engineered T cell receptors recognize HBV
core and HBsAg-derived peptides and then eliminate
HBV infected cells reducing viremia [143]. This approach
was tested in combination with Myrcludex B, which pre-
vents HBV entry. The adoptive transfer of PreS1 anti-
bodies prevented, or modulated, HBV infection after
a subsequent challenge of the virus in humanized uPA/
scid mice for 3 to 8 weeks [144]. In addition to listed
complex approaches, long-acting formulations of exist-
ing NAs with activities against HBV have great potential
to end the HBV epidemic, and humanized mouse models
are better suited for the advancement in studying such
formulations.
Viral cure strategies and humanized mice
Viral infections constitute a major public health threat
that underscore the need for innovative approaches and
preparedness to combat pandemics. Treatments with
antiviral drugs are used to limit the severity of illness
without eliminating the virus from the host cells. While
vaccines would be ideal in combating infections, rapid
viral mutations and heterogeneity have posed significant
challenges with only a few effective vaccines available for
a limited number of viruses [61]. For instance, the high
genetic variability and immune escape exhibited by HIV
and other RNA viruses such as HCV have impeded the
development of safe and effective vaccines against all
types and subtypes of the pathogen. These limitations
highlight the need for development of effective inter-
ventions that target multiple replication pathways to be
tested in appropriate animal model systems.
CRISPR-Cas based genome editing represent a novel
tool that has wide-ranging applications in the treat-
ment of various infectious and neurodegenerative dis-
eases [145, 146] and can be used to insert, delete or
modify target genes with very high precision and accu-
racy [147, 148]. CRISPR Cas allows for precisely edited
mouse models and opens doors of unlimited possi-
bilities. CRISPR-Cas can be used in humanized mouse
models to advance the treatment of diseases like cancer, 
diabetes, viral and nonviral infectious diseases. Hemo-
philia A patient-derived pluripotent stem cells were
edited ex-vivo using CRISPR and then transplanted into
the hind limb of hemophilia mice, increased survival of 
the mice was observed [149]. Similar approaches have
been employed for other hematological abnormalities. 
The ability of CRISPR to make edits ranging from a sin-
gle base to the insertion of long sections of DNA opens
the door for humanized mouse models where mouse
genes are replaced with human genes at multiple loci
[150] and will improve humanized mouse models for
neurodegenerative diseases [151]. Using a combination
of LASER ART and CRISPR-Cas9 HIV excision strate-
gies, our group recently achieved HIV eradication in
a subset of HIV infected humanized mice [152]. This is
the first study of its kind demonstrating HIV elimination
from infected animals (Fig. 2). CRISPR-Cas9 has been
proposed as a means of mimicking the CCR5 delta 32
mutations that provides a small percentage of the human
population resistance against HIV infection. Human pri-
mary ­CD4+ T cells were expanded then transduced with
lentivirus delivering CRISPR-Cas9 against CCR5. After
the CCR5 modification was confirmed, these cells were
transplanted in a NOD-Prkdcem26Cd52Il2rgem26Cd22/Nju
mice and reconstituted mice challenged with HIV-1. 
These animals displayed some degree of resistance but
failed to provide complete protection against HIV [153].
Use of preclinical mouse models and proper screening
can provide a better solution to study infectious diseases
and to find cure.
Neurodegenerative diseases and future
employments of humanized mice
Alzheimer’s disease
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurode-
generative disease affecting the elderly population and is
the sixth leading cause of death in the United States [154, 
155]. Promising outcomes in preclinical studies have not
always yielded positive clinical outcomes [156]. Recent
advancements have revealed that current animal mod-
els lack important biological features and therefore are
unable to mimic human disease pathology precisely. AD
researchers have commonly used first-generation trans-
genic mouse models that overexpress proteins linked to
familial AD, mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP),
or APP and presenilin. While these mice can demon-
strate AD pathology the animal models lack important
biological features and therefore are unable to mimic
human disease pathology precisely. This has given rise to
second-generation mouse models which contain human-
ized sequences and clinical mutations in the endogenous
mouse  App gene. Thus, limitations of first-generation
animal models are now successfully overcome by the
development of humanized knock-in mice as second-
generation models [157].  Human and mouse immune
and neuronal cells are different at the transcriptional
levels, therefore, offer differential responses against AD

Fig. 2  LASER ART and CRISPR-Cas9 therapies for HIV-1 elimination. Humanized mice developed (a) and HIV-1 infected humanized (b) mice were
administered with sequential treatment of a combination of long-acting ART followed by CRISPR-Cas9 targeting specific sequences of the HIV-1
genome (c). Using sequential treatments, complete HIV-1 elimination from a subset of animals. This combinatorial approach is being developed for
improved delivery of CRISPR-Cas9 to target the latent reservoirs in humanized mouse models (left panel), to improve the rates of viral elimination
(right panel) (Color explanation: blue color cells are represented as human cells, red color cells are represented HIV-1 infected cells and green color
represents the cells with complete elimitation of HIV-1)
pathological proteins, which can affect the efficacy of
therapeutic candidates in clinical testing [158, 159]. With
field advancement, human-induced pluripotent stem
cells have been transplanted into the mouse brain, allow-
ing for study on how amyloid pathology affects human
neurons in the context of a multicellular brain environ-
ment [160].  Additionally, transplantation of human-
induced pluripotent stem cells into immunodeficient
mice allowed development of human microglia cells, 
which interact with Aβ differently compared to the other
humanized mouse counterpart [161].  Our laboratory
recently developed human IL-34 transgenic mice under
immunodeficient genetic background, where upon trans-
plantation of human hematopoietic stem cells resulted
in human-like microglia cells development in the brain
[106]. The human adaptive immune response is differ-
ent from those mice [162, 163], which further affects APP
expression and Aβ accumulation. Therefore, with the
emerging role of the innate and adaptive immune arm
in AD pathogenesis and their differential regulation in
two different species, the urgent development is needed
for better small animal models with the complete human
immune system.
Parkinson’s disease 
The defining characteristic of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is
the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons originat-
ing in the substantia nigra (SNpc) and innervating to the 
striatum resulting in the concomitant loss of dopamine, 
the principal movement-controlling neurotransmitter
[164, 165]. This loss leads to the progressive development
of primary motor dysfunction and deficits, including
resting tremor, bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, and postural
instability. PD hallmarks include neuronal Lewy body
inclusions that are comprised primarily of misfolded, oli-
gomerized α-synuclein (α-syn), and histological evidence
of neuroinflammation as indicated by reactive microglia
encompassing regions of α-syn aggregation and neurode-
generation [166–169].
Rodent models of PD have been utilized to evaluate
immunomodulatory agents that target various inflection
points along the neuroinflammatory pathway. However, 
whether pro-inflammatory models that do not include
human components as targets will provide sufficient
robustness to bring translational therapeutics to comple-
tion has been contentious. To determine the acuity of the
human immune system in a PD model, NSG mice were
reconstituted with human CD34 + HSCs, and were con-
sidered engrafted with at least 25% HuCD45 + peripheral
mononuclear cells (PMNCs) by 12 weeks post-reconsti-
tution [170]. Engrafted mice and age-matched wild type
mice were treated with three doses of 1-methy-4-phenyl-
1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), a neurotoxin known
to cause PD like symptoms, at 18 mg/kg/dose every two
hours. One MPTP-treated group from each strain was
treated with tacrolimus (FK506),  a calcineurin/NFAT

inhibitor that suppresses T-lymphocyte signal transduc-
tion pathways and IL2 transcription and is indicated for
organ transplantation and ulcerative colitis [171, 172].
Previous studies demonstrated that FK506 reduced
α-syn aggregation and microglial activation with subse-
quent neuroprotection in animal models of PD, including
MPTP- and α-syn overexpression-induced dopaminergic
neurodegeneration [173–175]. Utilizing MPTP, this study
provided the first demonstration of induced PD-like
lesions and motor deficits in humanized CD34 + mice
[170]. Of note, treatment of humanized mice with MPTP/
FK506 resulted in enhanced survival of dopaminergic
neurons in the SN and efferent striatal termini, whereas
less survival was demonstrated in MPTP/FK506-treated
wild type mice. As expected, MPTP increased levels
of human cytokines, and FK506 treatment diminished
levels of most human cytokines in plasma from MPTP-
treated humanized mice, whereas only levels of human
IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12 were diminished from striatal
tissues. Interestingly, FK506 treatment did not signifi-
cantly affect levels of mouse cytokines from plasma or
striatum compared to MPTP-treated wild type animals. 
This suggests that the humanized mouse platform may
provide a more robust model for evaluation of translat-
able therapeutics in rodent models of PD. However, it
should be noted that few CNS-infiltrating macrophages/
microglia were of human origin as evidenced by low
levels of expression of HuCD45, HLA-DR, and human
CD68 in the CNS compared to the peripheral tissues. 
Additionally, the strains of the mice were of disparate
backgrounds with humanized mice derived from the
NOD/ShiLtJ compared to C57Bl/6 mice as wild types. 
Moreover, this study utilized female mice, whereas most
MPTP studies are performed in male mice to reduce
known variability observed with females. With the advent
of ART for HIV-1 treatment, individuals living with HIV
have longer lives with fewer co-morbidities, yet still can
exhibit motor deficits like PD [176–180]. Thus, a major, 
yet recurrent question is whether HIV infection affects
the development of PD-linked neurodegeneration. To
address that question, we investigated the effect of HIV
infection on nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurodegenera-
tion [181]. We initially used NSG mice reconstituted with
CD34 + human HSCs that could engraft for 18 weeks to
attain humanized mice with high levels of CD45 + cells. 
Humanized mice were infected for three weeks with
HIV-1 prior to intoxication with four doses of MPTP
at 14 mg/kg/dose every two hours. This study showed
that in the MPTP model, acute HIV infection afforded
no discernable susceptibility to dopaminergic neurode-
generation as demonstrated by insignificant differences
of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) + neuronal loss in the SN 
that ranged from 13 to 27% and losses of striatal termini
of 46% to 53%. Moreover, levels of microglia from HIV/
MPTP were not significantly elevated regardless of HIV
infection duration. Thus, these findings indicated either
the lack of a synergistic effect, lack of interaction between
the reconstituted human lymphocytes and murine
microglia within the humanized system, or the inability
of HIV to sufficiently infect mouse microglial cells. The
limited loss of dopaminergic neurons is most likely due
to the initial neurotoxicity associated with MPTP, rather
than the ensuing inflammatory cascade linked to immune
activation. Therefore, lack of a neurodegenerative pheno-
type associated with MPTP use in humanized, male mice
may indicate the need for experimentation in a differ-
ent rodent model of PD, such as α-syn overexpression or
the requirement of better CNS reconstitution of human
microglial cells. As novel therapeutic strategies are devel-
oped, humanized animal models of neurodegenerative
diseases (Fig. 3) are strongly needed to accelerate trans-
lation from preclinical to clinical setting [106, 182, 183].
There are obvious strengths, restrictions and opportuni-
ties of modeling functional and behavioral deficits associ-
ated with neurodegenerative disorders using humanized
mice models.  First, when fully developed such models
would allow investigations of functional neuronal defiicts
that link to behavioral outcomes in the context of a func-
tional human immune system. Second, neurological dis-
orders may be modeled more exactly as the role of both
innate and adaptive immunity comes more significant
in disease pathobiology. Third, a clear understanding of
the role human immunity plays at the neurobiochemical
levels can be uncovered and especially those that predict
behavioral insufficiencies and vice versa. Especially in the
case of PD where gait and locomotor abnormalities have
been well-characterized in prior rodent models these
can now be fully explored in the context of human T cell
functions and immune tolerance [170, 184–187]. While
motor deficits in the humanized CD34 + mice have been
described behavioral comparisons between established
rodent models and humanized models await future stud-
ies in these exciting models reflective a broad range of
human infectious and degenerative diseases [186].
Conclusions
Humanized mice represent the mainstream of avail-
able small animal models used to reflect the patho-
biology and developmental therapeutics for human
infectious, GVHD, cancerous and degenerative diseases. 
CD34 mouse models are employed in a variety of plat-
forms seeking drug safety and efficiency and especially
those that can modulate the immune system. Alto-

Fig. 3  Immune transformation in neurodegenerative disorders. Pathogenic changes seen in the brains of AD include accumulation of
intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles of Tau and extracellular Aβ plaques. These induce activation of CNS resident microglia and astrocytes leading
to neuroinflammation (top left). In contrast, transformation of an inflammatory microglia by medicines or immune modulation leads to neuronal
protection and maintenance of CNS homeostasis (top right). Similarly in PD, aggregated self-protein α-synuclein activates microglia leading
to neuronal damage within the substantia nigra pars compacta along with their connections into the striatum; brain subregions responsible
for coordinate movement (bottom left). However, brain homeostasis achieved through neuroprotection (bottom right) can affect clinical
improvements
laboratories continues to identify and develop novel
disease-modifying treatment options for viral, non-viral
and neurodegenerative disease. The pace of the therapeu-
tic development strongly relies on the quality and opti-
mization of preclinical models. Hence, such models can
ensure improved translation of various hopeful preclini-
cal results into interventions that will ultimately benefit
patients. To this end, we are pleased to provide an exam-
ple from our own laboratories in the field of LA ART. 
Herein humanized mice were used to test efficacy, safety, 
and pharmacokinetics that have sped the development of
our year long NM2CAB nano formulation. From these
early works in mice, we were able to decipher dose, bio-
compatibility, cell and tissue drug distribution, immune 
responses, dissolution parameters and antiretroviral
effectiveness. For the NM2CAB we found the prodrug
nano formulation to be sustained in a muscle depot then
disseminate to the lymphoid system and solid organs
with slow-release rates that lead to an extended half-life. 
Phase 1 clinical trials are now being planned because
of these early mouse experiments that facilitated devel-
opment and safety of these new formulations (Fig. 4).
However, this is yet one single example of the promise of
human translation by having the ability to mimic human
disease processes in a small animal. To that the best is
still yet to come.

Fig. 4  Potential of LASER ART for HIV-1 treatment and prevention. 
Based on extensive animal modeling, a single intramuscular injection
of a nanoformulated stearoylated CAB ester prodrug (NM2CAB) can
lead to sustained drug levels at the site of injection and within the
reticuloendothelial system for up to one year (top panel). The formed
CAB nanocrystals are absorbed from the injection site and undergo
dissolution for prodrug that is subsequently hydrolyzed into active
CAB in blood and tissue. CAB prodrug was recorded in all the tissues
during a year-long observation in rodents and rhesus macaques
after a singleNM2CAB injection. Top panel reflects how NM2CAB
can be distributed after an intramuscular injection. By contrast, the
nanoformulated NCAB is rapidly cleared from the site of injection and
tissues. For NCAB, therapeutic drug levels are present in lymphoid
tissues for one month (bottom panel)
