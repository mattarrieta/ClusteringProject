Abstract
Background: Avoidance of food allergens requires adapting dietetic habits, changing nutritional approach. A
restriction of food choice can result in a monotonous diet and impact social life. This study investigated the impact
of food allergy on nutritional behavior and attitudes of patients and their families.
Methods: A survey involving mothers of food allergic children aged 0–16 years was carried out. We primarily
studied the variables related to the child (age, gender, clinical history, food and social events attitudes). In addition,
Spielberg Trait-Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T) test was applied to the mothers. We assessed separately the associations
between characteristics of child-mother pairs and diet monotony, and attendance to social events, by means of
proportional odds regression models.
Results: Nearly 10% of the 124 participants completely banned allergenic foods at home and 15.3% consumed their
meals separately. More than one fourth attended parties rarely or never. Most of the participants reported a “monotonous
diet”. Model results suggested significant associations between child age (p = 0.05), mother age (p = 0.05), number of
excluded foods (p = 0.003) and monotony of the diet. The attendance of social events was inversely associated with
the number of excluded foods (p = 0.04) and the mother’s STAI-T T-score (p = 0.04).
Conclusions: The results highlighted the impact of food allergy in reducing interest about food and influencing
patients’ approach to social life. It is important to support families in managing allergens avoidance.

Introduction
Food allergy is a common disease, especially among
children, with data suggesting a cumulative prevalence
of 3% to 6% and a worrying increase in its incidence
[1,2].  The only therapy is still the total avoidance of
food allergens via elimination diets and emergency
treatment of symptoms caused by unintentional ingestion.
The limits imposed by the strict diet and the potential
risk of anaphylaxis make food allergy a burden for
patients and their families, affecting considerably their
quality of life (QoL) and psychosocial well-being [3,4].
Childhood food allergy is demonstrated to have a significant
impact on general health perception, emotional impact
and limitation on family activities [5-7].  Avoidance of

the implicated food requires families to adapt recipes
and make appropriate substitutions: each family must
determinate suitable approaches to best manage food
allergies, varying as the child age or as the situation
changes [8,9].  Attending birthday parties or visiting
relatives requires of opportune strategies to ensure food
allergic child’s safety [8]. Children who have experienced
a severe reaction sometimes develop disordered eating
or become withdrawn and fearful [10]. Only discussing
food can generate anxiety in these patients and is often
associated with physical reactions and illness [11]. Peanut
allergic children are demonstrated to have more fear
of adverse events and more anxiety about eating than
diabetic children [12].
Studies on caregivers of food allergic children confirmed
that food allergy significantly affects meal preparation
and family social activities, reporting also a considerable
impact on parents’ stress levels [13,14]. Mothers showed

worse psychological and physical quality of life and higher
anxiety and stress than fathers [15].
The present study was aimed to investigate the impact
of food allergy on behavior and attitudes towards food
among patients and their family. Particular attention was
given to the influence of age, gender, clinical history and
mother’s anxiety in the way of dealing with food allergy
day by day.
Methods
Setting and sample
A survey about nutritional behavior and attitudes was
carried out at the Referral Centre for Food Allergy
Diagnosis and Treatment, Veneto Region in Padua (North
Eastern Italy). Mothers were invited to participate while
accompanying the children to clinical visits. They were
given an information sheet outlining the study and
encouraged to ask the researcher questions. If interested
in participating, they signed a written consent form and
provided their contact and demographic details as wellas information about children clinical history. Then the
survey was administered: it was completed by mothers
only for pre-school children and by mothers and children
together for patients older than 6 years old. On average
this took approximately 20–25 min. Patients and their
mothers were recruited over a 6 month period. Inclusion
criteria included that children were confirmed suffering
from immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergy by
an allergology and immunology specialist on the basis
of a clinical history with evidence of sensitization and a
positive food challenge or positive skin prick test and/
or serum-specific IgE results. All participants developed
food allergy in early childhood and did not suffer from
serious concomitant non-allergic disease; children who
did not complete weaning were excluded. Food involved
in patients’ food allergy were milk, egg, wheat and nuts.
Patients’ characteristics (Table 1) were assessed through
a cross check between mothers report and case history
available at the Centre.
The study was performed in respect of the Italian
regulation regarding potential sensitive data and according
to World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human
Subjects.
Instruments
A questionnaire was created by a specialist in clinical
psychology with expertise in food allergy, a dietician and
a paediatric allergist. The survey consists of closed-ended
questions assessing the presence of allergens at home,
meal sharing, involvement in social activities including
food and the approach towards food (monotony of the
diet and interest about tasting new foods).  A copy is
available on request.

The STAI-T – Y form [16,17] was used to assess mothers’
trait mood through self report individual administration.
Specific instructions are provided to the respondent ac-
cordingly to the test manual [16].
This simple, widely and worldwide used test consists of
20 questions requiring the subjects to describe how they
generally feel and if their general response to situations is
perceived as threatening to measure anxiety.
A norm-based T-score using the mean and standard
deviation of the reference normative Italian population
[16] has been calculated for each subject according to
McCall formula. The mean of 50 represents the mean
score of the general population and 10 the standard
deviation. The mean T-score of the study sample can
therefore be interpreted in terms of how many standard
deviation units it is away from 50.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive analysis was used to outline the characteristics
of the participants and to illustrate the presence of
allergens at home, meal sharing, involvement in social
activities including food and the approach towards food.
By using ± 1 standard deviation from the mean of 50
as cut-off points for T-score STAI-T, three groups were
defined as follows: women with score below 40 (low
anxiety),  women with scores from 40 to 60 (moderate
anxiety) and women with scores higher than 60 (severe
anxiety).
A proportional odds regression model for ordinal data
was applied to each item score (dependent variable) and

included child (gender, age, adrenaline prescription,
previous anaphylactic reactions, number of excluded
foods) and mother characteristics (age, categorized
T-score STAI-T) as independent variables. This model
is a generalization of ordinary logistic regression for
binary outcomes and the results are expressed as Odds
Ratio (OR) and 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI). Each
OR may be interpreted as the effect of the variable on
the odds of being in a higher category of the outcome
(for monotonous diet score, the higher the worse; for
party attendance score, the higher the better) across
the entire range of values it takes.
Findings were analyzed using the STATA v9 statistical
software package. The level of significance was set at 5%.
Results
A total of 124 mother-child pairs consented to participate
in the study. Most children were male, 0–5 years old and
with a diet excluding more than one food item (Table 1).
Mothers’ mean level of anxiety was within the “normal”
interval (mean T-score STAI-T 46.8, 95% CI: 45.3 - 48.3).
The findings show up that 9.8% (n = 13) of the families
decided to absolutely exclude food allergens from their
home. 15.3% (n = 19) of the patients consume their meal
separately, not sharing it with other family member at
home or peers in school canteens. Concerning attendance
to social occasions involving foods, 44.3% (n = 55) declared
to participate always, the 29% (n = 36) only sometimes,
21% (n = 26) rarely and 5.7% (n = 7) asserted they never
attend to parties. Those who join in social gathering
reported (only for participants older than 6 years old)
they usually bring foods from home (n = 27) or eat only
“safe foods” (reading labels) (n = 37),  or take on both
solutions; only 2 persons declared to not assume any
kind of food when they attend to parties. Regarding
interest in tasting new foods, in a rising rating likert
scale from 1 to 5, the patients scored a mean of 3.3
(Median 3; Iqr 3).  Most of the participants (n = 77;
62%) claimed to have a “monotonous diet”: in a rising
rating scale from 1 to 5 they reported a mean score of
2.55 (Median 2; Iqr 3).  When asked about causes of
repetitive diet, they chose answers as follows: strict
avoidance (n = 37), low curiosity about food (n = 30), a
limited choice of food industry safe products (n = 23)
and difficulties in making traditional recipes (n = 22).
The proportional odds regression model suggested
significant associations between child age, mother age,
number of excluded foods and monotony of the diet
(Table 2). The more the child age increased the less the
diet was monotonous (per unit increase of age OR = 0.90
and 95% CI: 0.82-0.99); on the other hand, the more the
mother age raised the more the monotony of the feeding
enhanced (40 or more vs. 18–39 years old OR = 2.13 and
95% CI: 0.99-4.62). An increase in the number of excluded 
foods was related to an augment of the repetitiveness
of the diet (2 food items vs. 1 OR = 2.55 and 95% CI:
1.07-6.06; >2 food items vs. 1 OR = 4.71 and 95% CI:
1.94-11.4).
The attendance to social events involving foods was
found to decrease with the number of excluded foods (2
food items vs. 1 OR = 0.32 and 95% CI: 0.13-0.78) and
the mother’s T-score STAI-T (moderate score vs. low
score OR = 0.32 and 95% CI: 0.12-0.85).
Discussion and conclusions
Even if morbidity and mortality from food allergy in
children are generally low, strong evidence testifies that
food allergy has a relevant impact on psychological
distress and QoL of children and adolescents, as well
as their families [3].
Since recently health related QoL has been recognized
as an important outcome measure in clinical studies [18],
new instruments for assessing QoL in food allergic
children have been developed and validated in order
to provide further insights into the problems these
children encounter [3].
However, even if it is impossible to disregard that eating
is strongly related with familial, social and group activities,
the effects of food allergy on nutritional approach of patients
and their families are still relatively under-explored.
The main objective of the present survey was verifying
in a sample of mother-child pairs the impact of food allergy
on family’s attitudes towards food, with implications for
social life. According to our results, children food allergy
seems to strongly influence the family eating habits of a
portion of respondents: nearly 10% of the participants’
families decided to completely exclude food allergens
from their home: this means that all family members
follow the restricted diet; this is a “drastic” measure
finalized to guarantee a safe environment to the allergic
child, eliminating accidental ingestions and contaminations.
However, excluding the offending food from the domestic
setting could prevent the child from being trained to avoid
allergens. In fact, families that bring the allergen into
the home implement strategies to correctly discriminate
between safe and not safe foods and have the opportunity
to teach the child how to manage avoidance [8].
Moreover, even if most of the participants share meals
with family or peers, about one sixth of the interviewed
patients consumed their meals separately from the other
family members and/or did not attend school canteens
to minimize the risk of contaminations. This obviously
can have an impact on social life [19,20]. This happens,
above all, concerning attendance to social occasions
involving foods: more than one fourth of the participants
asserted they attend parties rarely or never. Particularly, in
our sample, the increasing of the number of excluded
foods was related to a decreasing on the attendance to

social events. The result is in line with literature data
reporting a significant disruption in family social events
[3,7]:  many parents would rather reduce the risk and
concern induced by social activities by avoiding them
altogether [13] and a number of parents report preventing
their child from attending parties and school trips [21].
Interestingly the mothers’ trait anxiety T-score was found
to impact on the attendance to social events involving
foods, a moderate score, rather than a low score, being
linked to a decreasing in joining social gathering.
The participants (older than 6 years old) who declared
to attend parties always or sometimes reported to usually
use two main strategies to cope with the burden of food
allergy: many of them carefully check labels to assure
the avoidance of allergens from foods, confirming how
label reading represents the keystone of food allergy
management [8,22,23]. As an alternative, children bring
foods from home. Only in a very small number of cases
participants reported to usually not assume any kind of
food when attending social events.
A varied nutrient intake provides the opportunity for an
adequate nutrient intake balance reducing malnutrition
risks [24,25].  When asked about interest in tasting new
foods and monotony of the diet, the participants showed
a medium-level score and reported “strict avoidance”
and “low curiosity about food” as the main causes of
repetitive diet. This could be linked to the fact that
children suffering from food allergy sometimes develop
disordered eating or become withdrawn and fearful about 
food [10,11,26].  The avoidance of allergen traces is
often a necessary strategy to stay away from the risk of
reactions, however, it is found to be a heavy burden for
patients and their families. A better allergy-specific
QoL in mothers and their children who report eating
products labelled “may contain nuts” than those who
strictly avoided all nuts was reported [5].  In addition,
many families reported that the most significant obstacle
which prevents them leading a normal life is the wide-
spread use of “allergen traces” labelling on pre-packed
foods [23]. Other reasons reported in the present study
for monotonous diet are, in fact, a limited choice of
food industry safe products and difficulties in making
traditional recipes.
The monotony of the diet was resulted influenced by
the child and mother age in an opposite way. The
more the mother age raised the more the monotony of
feeding enhanced. Avoidance of the allergen requires
mothers to learn to adapt recipes and make appropriate
substitutions [8] so that more than 60% of caregivers
reported that food allergy significantly affected meal
preparation [13]. It could be that older mothers have more
difficulties in making traditional recipes using alternative
ingredients or in finding new adequate recipes. To the
contrary, an increasing of the child age was linked to a
decreasing on the repetitiveness of the diet: it could
reflect children overcoming some food allergies [1] extend
their diet, or simply change in dealing with food over
time.

Similarly to what observed for the attendance to social
events, the increasing of the number of excluded foods
was related to an augment of the repetitiveness of the
diet, confirming that the number of food allergies had a
significant negative impact on family activities [13,27]
and on the perceived overall health-related QoL [7].
Even if not as a primary intent, this study investigated
also the influence of mothers’  trait anxiety on the food
approach and management. Most of the patients’ mothers
(n = 114; 91.9%) reported a moderate or low mean score
when compared with the Italian normative data. At the
contrary, some studies reported higher trait-anxiety levels
in food allergic mothers than in norm means [5,15].  A
possible explanation could be that all the participants
of the present study attended a Referral Centre for Food
Allergy Diagnosis and Treatment, where they received
adequate information and support about the disease:
this could have influenced mothers’  level of anxiety;
therefore, caution is needed in generalizing these results.
The mothers’ trait anxiety T-score was found to impact
on the attendance to social events involving foods: a
moderate score, rather than a low score, is linked to a
decreasing in joining social gathering. A phenomenological
study underlined how the feeling of “living with risk”
was present in food allergic children’s mothers and it
was associated to an emerging feeling of “living with
fear” that could influence everyday life [28]. A link between
mother’s wellbeing and “social” managing of food allergy
was found; nevertheless further researches are needed
to understand the underlying psychological mechanisms.
This study investigated the impact of food allergy on
nutritional behavior and attitudes of the patients and
their families, exploring the influence of some variables
in their way of dealing with the disease. Gender and
clinical history seemed to not influence the findings.
As far as we know, this is the first study focusing
specifically on the issue. Our results underline the
impact of food allergy in reducing interest about food
and in influencing patients’ approach to social life: these
findings stress in fact the importance of supporting
families in managing psychosocial aspect of food avoid-
ance and in arousing curiosity in children, suggesting
recipes for a varied and stimulating diet.
