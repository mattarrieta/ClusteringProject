Abstract
Background: Wheat allergy is among the most common food allergy in children, but few publications are available
assessing the risk of anaphylaxis due to wheat.
Methods: In this study, we report the case of near-fatal anaphylaxis to wheat in a patient undergoing an oral food
challenge (OFC) after the ingestion of a low dose (256 mg) of wheat. Moreover, for the first time, we analyzed the
risk of anaphylaxis during an OFC to wheat in 93 children, compared to other more commonly challenged foods
such as milk, egg, peanuts, and soy in more than 1000 patients.
Results: This study, which includes a large number of OFCs to wheat, shows that wheat is an independent risk
factor that is associated with anaphylaxis requiring epinephrine administration (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2.4) and
anaphylaxis requiring epinephrine administration to low dose antigen (OR = 8.02). Other risk factors for anaphylaxis,
anaphylaxis requiring epinephrine administration, and anaphylaxis to low dose antigen was a history of a prior
reaction not involving only the skin (OR = 1.8, 1.9 and 1.8 respectively). None of the clinical variables available prior
to performing the OFC could predict which children among those undergoing OFCs to wheat would develop
anaphylaxis or anaphylaxis for low dose antigen.
Conclusion: This study shows that wheat is an independent risk factor that is associated with anaphylaxis requiring
epinephrine administration and anaphylaxis requiring epinephrine administration to low dose antigen.
Introduction
The recommended evaluation for food allergy (FA) in-
cludes a detailed history and physical examination, fol-
lowed by selected in vivo and in vitro tests based on the
history (1). Oral food challenges (OFCs) are performed ei-
ther because the food allergy is not supported by history,
because there is a discrepancy between history and test re-
sults or because newly developed tolerance need to be
established [1]. The demand for OFCs for FA evaluation
has greatly increased in the last decade due to an increased
prevalence of FA [2] and an increased number of elimin-
ation diets started solely on the basis of commercially avail-
able in vitro testing [3].  OFCs are commonly associated

with inherent risks, as up to 28% of OFCs have systemic
reactions [4].  However, for the most part, they are per-
ceived to be safe and hence, they are often done in an out-
patient office setting not necessarily located in close
proximity to a hospital [5]. The increased need for OFCs
has created a need to identify which patients are at the
greatest risk to develop anaphylaxis during an OFC, so that
the correct location of OFC performance can be deter-
mined and appropriate counseling to the family on risk as-
sociated with OFC can be reviewed [5-7].
Wheat has been increasingly reported to be a risk factor
for exercise-induced anaphylaxis [8].  Water insoluble
omega-5-gliadin (Tri a 19) has been identified as a major al-
lergen in Finnish subjects with Food-Dependant Exercise-
Induced Anaphylaxis (FDEIA) [9,10]. However, in studies
on food challenges, wheat has never been reported as a spe-
cific risk factor for developing anaphylaxis [3-5,7].  Most
studies have found that wheat challenges present a rate of

failure similar to other foods (30-50%), with use of epineph-
rine only in fraction of cases (10-20%) [4,5].
In this study, we report a case of near-fatal anaphyl-
axis to wheat in a patient undergoing an OFC after the
ingestion of a low dose of wheat. Moreover, for the first
time, we will analyze the risk of anaphylaxis during a
food challenge to wheat; compared to other more com-
monly challenged foods such as milk, egg, peanuts, and
soy. This study contains one of the largest reported
numbers of food challenges to wheat and specifically
analyzes wheat as a risk factor for anaphylaxis during
OFCs.
Methods
Study population and oral challenges
We performed a retrospective analysis of children who
underwent OFCs to wheat, soy, milk, egg, and peanut at
The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Pediatric
Day Medicine unit from August 2004 to December 2010.
Oral food challenges (OFCs) were performed either be-
cause a food allergy was not supported by history (i.e. the
food has never been eaten before or was previously toler-
ated and stopped because of positive skin testing or detec-
tion of specific serum IgE for the food) or because newly
developed tolerance needed to be established. None of the
reported OFCs were done prior to and with the intent to
initiate an oral desensitization protocol. Clinical data of
patients’ serum wheat, soy, milk, egg white, and peanut–
specific IgE antibody levels (sIgE), skin prick test (SPT) re-
sults, previous history of systemic reaction, history of
asthma or eczema, and oral challenge outcomes of chil-
dren were collected. All patients had either skin prick test-
ing or specific serum IgE (ImmunoCap) performed in the
6 months prior to the OFC. Parents of the child described
in the case report provided written consent for data to be
used in this publication. All investigations were approved
by the CHOP Internal Review Board. (See also supple-
mental material). OFCs were performed by starting with a
dose of 0.1 mL, followed by 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 30, and
60 mL, 120 ml, and 240 ml for liquid foods (milk). For
solid foods (peanut, egg powder, milk powder, wheat and
soy),  the challenge doses administered were 125 mg,
250 mg, 500 mg, 1gm, 2 gm, 4 gm, 8 gm, and ad lib (mini-
mum of 8 gm). In select cases a lower starting dose (20–
60 mg) was chosen for very high risk kids. Each dose was
administered with an interval of 15 to 20 minutes until ad
lib doses were reached or the patient experienced a reac-
tion within 2 hours of the last dose. Challenges were
stopped for gastrointestinal reactions, respiratory cardio-
vascular or neurologic symptoms, non-contact cutaneous
reactions or multi-system reactions. All providers followed
the same standardized protocol as described. All children
held antihistamine use for at least 5 days prior to OFC. 
Classification of reactions
Reactions on presentation and challenges were classified
as cutaneous, respiratory, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular,
neurologic, multiple-organ system [11,12]. Cutaneous re-
actions included urticaria, erythematous flushing, cuta-
neous angioedema, or flaring of atopic dermatitis on
non-contact areas. Respiratory reactions encompassed
rhinitis, sneezing, voice change, throat tightness, dyspnea,
cough, wheeze, shortness of breath, or tachypnea. Gastro-
intestinal reactions consisted of abdominal pain, emesis,
or diarrhea. Cardiovascular reaction included hypotension
and neurologic reactions included fainting [11,12]. Medi-
cations were administered immediately on detection of an
allergic reaction, and the decision to administer was based
on clinical judgment. The reactions for which epinephrine
was given were based on current clinical definition of ana-
phylaxis [13]. Although multisystemic reactions in an out-
patient setting should be treated with epinephrine [11,14],
in a hospital setting under the supervision of an expert
physician treating allergic reactions, epinephrine is used
with more stringent criteria of anaphylaxis [13,15,16].
Multisystemic reactions characterized by mild skin reac-
tions and transient abdominal pain or 1 episode of mild
vomiting, or mild transient rhinitis, were classified as
multi-systemic but were not treated in all cases with epi-
nephrine. Patients were observed for at least 4 hours after
an allergic reaction.
Patients were divided into 5 categories: positive OFC
(any reaction), OFC that resulted in multiorgan involve-
ment (Multisystemic), OFC that resulted in multiorgan in-
volvement after low dose ingestion (Multisystemic <1 g),
OFC that resulted in epinephrine intramuscular (i.m.) ad-
ministration (Epinephrine), and OFC that resulted in epi-
nephrine i.m. administration after low dose ingestion
(Epinephrine <1 g) [11,12].
Skin testing and serum IgE
SPTs were performed by the prick method using commer-
cial extracts (Greer Laboratories, Lenoir, NC) and bifur-
cated needles. Maximal wheal and flare diameter was
measured at 15 minutes (12). Serum samples were ana-
lyzed for egg white, milk and peanut–sIgE antibody con-
centrations by using the Pharmacia CAP system FEIA
(Pharmacia and Upjohn Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden).
The lower limit of detection was 0.35 kU/L. (see Supple-
mental material for details).
Statistical methods
The relationships between the different types of OFC
outcomes and other characteristics in both groups of
children were analyzed by calculating the odds ratio and
confidence intervals using a univariate or multivariate
logistic regression [17].

Results
OFC analysis
History of asthma, eczema, type of previous reaction,
history of prior ingestion, sIgE and SPT-wheal measures
to specific foods, and the outcome of food challenges in
1187 open OFCs to wheat, milk, egg, soy or peanuts
were analyzed. The demographics of the study popula-
tion are reported in Additional file 1 Table S1E. More
than half of the children had co-morbidity with eczema
(53%) and/or asthma (56%).  The group consisted pri-
marily of males (70%) around 5 years of age (mean age
4.8 years: range 6 months to 20 years). Skin tests were
done in 1172 patients, and specific IgE for specific aller-
gens were available in 755 patients. Given both the high
cost of co-pay in most insurance plans for specific serum
IgE and needle phobia, a significant proportion of pa-
tients opted to do food challenges without obtaining
sIgE first. In 15 patients, only serum IgE were obtained,
as skin testing was not possible for multiple reasons, in-
cluding inability to stop antihistamines, parental refusal,
and severe eczema. There were 3 patients in the milk
group who did not have skin testing (Serum IgE Ku/L
respectively 1; 1.18; 9),  5 in the egg group (Serum IgE
Ku/L respectively 3.22; 2; 2.42; 4.72; 2.22), 4 in the pea-
nut group (Serum IgE Ku/L respectively 10; 0.66, 1, 2), 1
in the wheat group (Serum IgE Ku/L 44), and 2 in the
soy group (Serum IgE Ku/L respectively 1.13 and 4).
This is in line with current guidelines, which state
that sIgE tests and skin testing are useful to identify
foods which may potentially provoke IgE-mediated food-
induced allergic reactions. However the same guidelines
state that positive skin testing and sIgE when used alone
are not diagnostic of FA. Furthermore, the guidelines do
not recommend the use of sIgE or SPT as the sole guide
to determine whether or not to perform an OFC [11].
Hence, OFCs are often decided based on clinical history
and necessity, as well as the benefit/risk ratio to reintro-
duce a food. Particularly for those foods such as milk, egg,
and wheat, which are a major staple of the Western diet, a
higher risk of failing OFCs is generally accepted by parents
and physicians [15]. The OFCs we have analyzed, as well
as the one reported in the clinical case, were performed
for clinical and not research purposes. Hence, the work-
up was largely based on current guidelines.
The mean wheal and flare in mm for all patients was
6.1 mm (range 0-25 mm) and 16.3 mm (range 0-45 mm)
respectively. The mean sIgE for specific food allergens
were 7.1 ± 16.3 kU/L (range 0–100 kUI/L).  Reported 
outcomes of wheat OFCs based on sIgE and skin prick test
levels are given in Additional file 1 Table S2E.
Patients who underwent the challenge for wheat tended
to be younger, had smaller skin tests but higher levels of
sIgE, had asthma less often, and had a history of prior in-
gestion or prior reaction to the food tested compared to
those children who presented for food challenges to all
the other foods (Table 1). Those children who failed the
challenge to wheat were younger and had smaller skin
tests, but higher levels of sIgE. Younger age and smaller
skin tests were also noted in those who had multisystemic
reaction and in those who needed intramuscular epineph-
rine. (Table 1 and Additional file 1 Table S3E). This is not
surprising, as younger children tend to have smaller skin
prick test. The higher sIgE can be explained by the fact
that sIgE cut-offs for wheat have poor specificity and sen-
sitivity in predicting OFC outcomes and is generally not
considered a good screen to decide who needs to undergo
OFC to wheat [4,18].
We performed a univariate logistic regression to see if
any clinically available characteristics could help to
identify children who were at higher risk to develop
multisystemic reactions or multisystemic reactions for
low dose of allergen with or without the use of epineph-
rine during a wheat challenge. Having a history of
asthma and a previous reaction were associated with
multisystemic reactions (Table 2).
We then analyzed clinically available characteristics that
were associated with the 5 studied categories (Table 3).
Forty-five percent of the challenges were positive, with the
following failure rates for each food: wheat 39 of 93 (42%),
soy 26 of 114 (23%), milk 144 of 290 (50%), egg 190 of 409
(47%), and peanut 130 of 283 (46%). Soy challenges were
significantly associated with lower risk of positive OFC
and milk with higher risk. As previously reported [7],
other risk factors for a positive OFC were older age, larger
wheal and flare of SPT, higher sIgE levels, a history of
prior reaction and prior reaction not limited to the skin, a
personal history of asthma, and a prior ingestion of the
food more than one year ago. Risk factors for OFCs
resulting in multisystemic reactions were a milk challenge,
older age, larger wheal and flare of SPT, higher sIgE levels,
a history of prior reaction and prior reaction not limited
to the skin, a personal history of asthma, and prior inges-
tion of the food more than one year ago. A risk factor for
OFCs resulting in multisystemic reactions for low dose
antigen was undergoing a peanut challenge. Risk factors
for reaction requiring epinephrine i.m were a peanut or
wheat challenge, larger SPT sizes, higher specific IgE
levels, male sex, older, and prior reaction not limited to
the skin. Risk factors for anaphylaxis that required epi-
nephrine i.m. use at low dose of antigen were peanut or
wheat challenge and a prior reaction not limited to the
skin, whereas egg food challenges were associated with the

least risk of developing anaphylaxis for low dose antigen
(Table 3).
A multivariate logistic regression analyzing the inde-
pendent weight of the six factors associated with both
multisystemic reactions and multisystemic reactions for
low dose antigen with or without the use of epinephrine
i.m. (wheat challenge, peanut challenge, soy challenge,
age, wheal size, and prior reaction not limited to the
skin) showed that peanut challenges put patients at risk
of anaphylaxis for low dose antigen (regardless of the
use of epinephrine) and wheat challenges put patients
more at risk of reactions requiring epinephrine, espe-
cially after low dose antigen (OR = 8.02). 
Having a prior reaction not limited to the skin and
larger skin testing were independently associated with
multisystemic reactions and multisystemic reactions for
low dose antigen and use of Epinephrine.
Discussion
The demand for OFC for FA evaluation has greatly in-
creased in the last decade due to an increased prevalence
of FA [2,19] and the increased number of elimination di-
ets started solely on the basis of the commercially avail-
able in vitro testing [3]. However, up to 28% of OFCs are
associated with systemic and potentially life-threatening
reactions [4]. Stratification of the risk of OFC is therefore

becoming increasingly important to choose the right loca-
tion of OFC performance and also to better counsel the
family on risk associated with OFC. Previous studies exam-
ining the relationship of skin prick tests (SPT) [20-22] or
food-specific serum IgE levels (sIgE) [4,21,23,24] and chal-
lenge outcome show that both SPT and sIgE tests individu-
ally are very useful in predicting those patients who have a
risk to fail the OFC [25]. Indeed many studies have deter-
mined “cut-off” levels for specific serum IgE and skin prick
tests size that predict 95% or 50% of the food challenges re-
actions for some food allergens such as milk, egg, peanut,
tree nuts, sesame seed and fish . However far less clear are
those risk factors that predispose to develop a severe life
threatening reaction after OFC. So far, sIgE and SPT have
not been shown to be able to predict severe reactions after
OFC when used in isolation [4,26]. Indeed, other factors
such as history of asthma, older age or previous history of
multiorgan-system reaction have been reported to be asso-
ciated with more severe reactions in children with FA but
not as factors predicting the severity of the reaction in-
duced by OFC [12,27-30]. However, there is a wide agree-
ment that although higher levels of specific IgE increase
the likelihood of failing an OFC, it does not predict the se-
verity of the reaction [4,6,30,31]. Two recent papers have
suggested that a more complex model incorporating test
results and clinical history had a better the predictive abil-
ity compared with sIgE and SPT used either alone and in
combination [6,7]. Other studies have also shown a chal-
lenge to peanut to be a risk factor for more severe reac-
tions requiring epinephrine use [5].
Food allergy to wheat (both IgE and non-IgE mediated)
is well-known and manifests with a variety of symptoms
that include atopic dermatitis exacerbations [24,32-34],
exercise-induced anaphylaxis [8], eosinophilic esophagitis
[35],  baker’s asthma [36],  and celiac disease [37].  The
prevalence of clinically relevant wheat allergy is not well
established, but is estimated to be less than 0.5% to 1%,
with most children outgrowing it by age 16 [18], despite
the fact that positive SPTs have been reported in the gen-
eral pediatric population in more than 3% of children [38].
It also appears that IgE against different epitopes may be
responsible for different phenotypes of wheat-related al-
lergy as well as its severity [36,39-46].  Indeed, recently
there have been two reports that indicate that omega-5
gliadin predicts for severe reactions in OFC to wheat
[47,48].  Furthermore, wheat has been also increasingly
reported to be a risk factor for exercise-induced anaphyl-
axis [8]. Water insoluble omega-5-gliadin (Tri a 19) has
been identified as a major allergen in Finnish subjects with
Food-Dependent Exercise-Induced Anaphylaxis (FDEIA)
[9,10].
Most case series on OFCs report no concern for specific
severity of reaction to wheat, and these challenges are gen-
erally considered less dangerous than milk, egg, and 
peanut [3-5,49]. In no cases of fatal or near-fatal anaphyl-
axis has wheat been reported as a cause [27,50,51]. How-
ever werecently treated a 7 year old female who had near
fatal anaphylaxis to wheat after OFC. The patient was new
to our practice as she moved from out of state and came
for an evaluation of multiple food allergies and failure to
thrive. She had a history of eczema as an infant and mul-
tiple food allergen triggers had been identified. The first
ingestion of cow’s milk and egg had caused eczema flares,
urticaria, and lip and eyelid angioedema. As part of the ec-
zema and food allergy evaluation in infancy she was found
to be positive per parental report to milk, egg, wheat, bar-
ley, shellfish, fish, treenuts, and peanuts and was currently
avoiding all those foods. When she came to our practice
she had a very restricted diet consisting of meats, fruits,
vegetables, berries, rice pasta, and soy butter. Her growth
was poor. At 7 years of age she had a height of 112 cm (3rd
percentile) and a weight of 16.20 kg (0.22nd percentile).
We did not have any record of the data (SPT and/or spe-
cific IgE) obtained with her initial diagnosis of wheat. The
patient had an Immunocap of 65 KU/L for wheat obtained
16 months prior to the OFC.
From the time of diagnosis in infancy, she only had
limited accidental exposures to wheat, never as an iso-
lated ingredient. Specifically, at age 1.5 years, she in-
gested macaroni and cheese and developed hives on
her lower extremities which responded to oral diphen-
hydramine. At age 2.5 years, she had a contact reaction
to a brownie, where she developed facial hives which
resolved with diphenhydramine. Both foods contained
also milk and egg to which she had previous reactions.
She had one episode of anaphylaxis at age 3.5 years
after the ingestion of seasoned fries which contained
both wheat and egg allergens. She developed cough and
was given epinephrine for this reaction. Skin prick test-
ing obtained about 3.5 months prior to the OFC in-
cluded SPT (Greer Laboratories, Lenoir, NC) to wheat
(8 mm X 20 mm) to standard reagent. Cow's Milk (7
mm X 20 mm), Egg (4 mm X 15 mm), Peanut (15 mm
X 27 mm), Barley (5 mm X 15 mm), Rye (6 mm X 17
mm), Salmon (5 mm X 16 mm), Tuna (5 mm X 15 mm)
Hazelnut (5 mm X 15 mm), Pecan (4 mm X 18 mm),
Clam (5 mm X 21 mm), Crab Mix (5 mm X 25 mm),
Shrimp (9 mm X 26 mm). During the visit, it was clear
that additional foods needed to be identified so that her
diet could be expanded, given her history of failure to
thrive. As she had had no reaction history to wheat as
an isolated food, the SPT size was similar to all the
other food allergens tested, and the most recent expos-
ure to wheat was distant (3.5 years prior), the decision
was made to perform an OFC to wheat. Her family was
aware of the risk involved with OFC, but perceived the
benefit of reintroducing wheat into the diet to outweigh
the risk of OFC.

A standard dosing protocol for IgE mediated allergy
was followed for her wheat OFC (see Methods). She was
administered a starting dose of 0.085 grams of wheat
protein (1 g of wheat powder).  She was asymptomatic.
Twenty minutes after the second dose of 0.171 grams of
wheat protein (2 g of wheat powder) was given, she de-
veloped emesis, rhinorrhea, cough, and wheeze. She was
administered epinephrine (0.01 mg/kg of 1:1000 aqueous
solution) i.m. She also developed diffuse hives, for which
she was given cetirizine by mouth. Approximately 1 hour
after this second dose of wheat protein was adminis-
tered; she became pre-syncopal and had hypotension
(lowest reading noted was 75/35 with a heart rate of
145).  She was given supplemental oxygen via a face-
mask. Additionally, a total of 1200 milliliters of normal
saline was pushed via two peripheral intravenous cathe-
ters. Three more epinephrine injections i.m. were ad-
ministered during the resuscitation, as she continued
with hypotension despite the epinephrine and intraven-
ous fluid administration. She was transferred to the
Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for further treatment.
While there, she had an additional episode of emesis. She
was given an epinephrine infusion (0.02 mcg/kg/min) in
the PICU for 4 hours. Adjunct medications given included
ranitidine and methylprednisolone. The cumulative dose
of wheat protein administered during this challenge was
256.25 mg.
This clinical case we presented shows, that wheat can
cause severe and near-fatal anaphylaxis after ingestion of a
low dose (˜260 mg). In this patient with established mul-
tiple food allergies, the previous reaction to wheat was dis-
tant in time, and it was not clear if it was due specifically
to wheat or other food allergies (egg). The described OFC
was done to confirm that a true IgE-mediated allergy
existed. The food challenge was deemed necessary in face
of slow growth of the patient due to a restricted diet for
multiple food allergies. The patient had a skin test com-
parable to other foods to which she had known allergic re-
actions, which were distant in time. Wheat was chosen
over egg and milk which are considered more dangerous
than wheat challenge. After the severe reaction experi-
enced during this OFC we reviewed our OFC cases in the
last six years to see if wheat was associated with a higher
risk of anaphylaxis, especially at low doses. No study be-
fore indeed has ever specifically analyzed the risk of wheat
challenges. We divided the patients in 5 categories that
represent progressively more severe reactions, with those
requiring epinephrine for low dose antigen representing
the more severe type. We hypothesized that factors that
would contribute significantly to more severe reactions
would display highest correlation for the more severe reac-
tion such as those requiring the use of epinephrine. Using
an univariate regression analysis we first identified in chil-
dren clinical characteristics that were associated with the 
5 different type reactions studied in children undergoing
OFC to wheat vs. those children undergoing OFC to milk,
egg, peanut, soy. In all studied groups, we found that chil-
dren undergoing food challenges to wheat were younger
and had smaller SPT. This is not surprising, as younger
children tend to have a smaller size of skin testing. How-
ever, children undergoing a food challenge to wheat and
those having any reaction had a higher sIgE to wheat. This
is also to be expected as the cut-off levels for specific
serum IgE for wheat are not well established, with most
studies showing that children even with high levels of IgE
may be able to pass a food challenge to wheat; moreover,
given the importance of wheat in Western diets, parents
and doctors are willing to accept higher risk of a failed
OFC (4, 18, 52). However, children who experienced ana-
phylaxis to wheat did not have higher sIgE compared to
children with a similar reaction to other foods (Table 1
and Additional file 1 Table S2E). Given the fact that sIgE
was obtained in a small group of patients undergoing
OFCs to wheat, we cannot exclude that this could be due
to lack of statistical power. Indeed of 28 children who had
multisystemic reactions for wheat, only 3 had measured
levels of IgE.
Among children who reacted to wheat, we evaluated if
any of the characteristics could predict a more severe reac-
tion. We found that those who reacted with any type of re-
action to wheat were more likely to have asthma (odds
ratio [OR] = 3.2) and to have had a distant prior reaction to
wheat (OR = 3.1). None of the studied characteristics were
able to predict more severe reactions (Table 2). These find-
ings could be due to the limited number of children (28
children, Table 1) having wheat-induced severe reactions.
We then analyzed with a univariate logistic regression
which clinical characteristics, including undergoing a chal-
lenge to a specific food, were associated with higher risk of
increasingly severe reactions (Table 3).  As previously
reported [6,7,52], the risk factors for OFCs resulting in re-
actions that needed epinephrine use were undergoing a
peanut challenge, older age, being a male, having larger
wheal and flare at SPT, higher sIgE levels, a history of
prior reaction or prior reaction not limited to the skin. As
with others before, we found that the strongest risk was
actually represented by a having a prior reaction not in-
volving the skin [7]. All the other ORs were close to 1, so
they may be less clinically relevant. However the strength
of their significance association was high and confirmed
previously published data [3,5-7,15]. Moreover for the first
time we showed that among children undergoing OFC for
the main food allergens, wheat was more strongly associ-
ated than peanuts with the risk of having reactions requir-
ing the use of epinephrine. This association was even
stronger for those reactions that happened after a low dose
ingestion, where OFC to wheat had a similar risk than
having a prior reaction not involving the skin (Table 3).

A multivariate logistic regression analyzing the inde-
pendent weight of the six factors associated more severe
reactions showed that peanut challenges put patients at
risk of anaphylaxis for low dose antigen (regardless of
the use of epinephrine) and wheat challenges put pa-
tients more at risk for reactions requiring epinephrine
use especially after low dose antigen (OR = 8.02) (Table 4).
In our multivariate analysis we did not include sIgE, as they
were not obtained for a substantial number of patients lim-
iting their statistical power.
Hence for the first time this paper identifies wheat
challenge as an independent risk factor for severe reac-
tion after OFC. These results could be explained by the
relatively younger age of our patient population under-
going OFC to wheat, the lack of well defined risk factor
such as cutoff levels to predict OFC failure, and the per-
ceived safety in performing the food challenge to wheat
compared to other foods. However, the intrinsic charac-
teristic of the wheat allergen may predispose patients
who have a true allergy to wheat to react with more se-
vere reactions.
In our population, patients undergoing OFC to wheat
were younger for all type of reactions. This could explain
the more severe reactions, as younger children are less
able to notify about early symptoms. However in the
multivariate analysis, wheat OFC was associated with
more severe reactions independent from age. Moreover,
children undergoing wheat challenge may have had
more severe allergy than those undergoing other OFC,
as they had a higher sIgE to wheat than the children in
the other groups. This can be explained by the fact that
the sIgE or skin testing size cut off for wheat has poor
specificity and sensitivity in predicting OFC outcomes
[4], with most studies showing that children even with
high levels of IgE may be able to pass a food challenge
to wheat [4,18,53].  For example, Sampson et al. deter-
mined that 100 KU/L for wheat had a positive predictive
value of only 75% [24]. Perry et al. reported that 56% of
children with serum IgE >20 kU/L would pass the OFC
to wheat. Similarly, Keet at al reported that children
tend to outgrow wheat allergies, with a rate of resolution
of 65% by 12 years of age. Although they reported that 
higher wheat IgE levels were associated with poorer out-
comes, children outgrew wheat allergy with even the
highest levels of wheat IgE. Indeed they reported that
twenty-one percent of those whose peak wheat IgE level
was more than 100 kU/L had resolved wheat allergy
[18].  Also for skin testing, no reliable skin test cut off
has ever been established [54,55]. The fact that specific
IgE for wheat have poor positive predictive value for
wheat allergy is due most likely to the cross reactivity
between grass pollens and wheat [54-56]. Based on the
above studies, most authors agree that oral re-challenges
remain mandatory in case of allergy to wheat [53].
Hence, OFCs to wheat are often decided based on clin-
ical history and necessity as well as the benefit/risk ratio
to reintroduce a food. As wheat is a major staple of the
Western diet, higher risk of failing OFCs is generally ac-
cepted by parents and physicians. Finally, physicians
may have less experience with wheat challenges, as
wheat allergy is less prevalent than egg, peanut milk and
soy allergy and physicians may rely on the notion that
wheat is a relatively safe OFC based on the data of the
literature [15]. However wheat may pose a risk of severe
reactions in patients truly sensitized and they may react
to relatively low dose of antigen [54,55]. Furthermore, an
increasingly high number of studies show a significant
correlation of wheat ingestion and exercise induced ana-
phylaxis [9,10].
In conclusion, this study, for the first time, shows that
wheat can be a risk factor for severe allergic reaction
during OFC. It appears from our study that caution
should be used in children undergoing OFCs to wheat
who have had a previous history of a reaction that did
not involve only the skin. Given the fact that children
can react at a low dose, a starting dose of less than
100 mg should be advocated for wheat challenges. Re-
cently, there have been two reports that indicate that
omega-5 gliadin predicts for severe reactions in OFCs to
wheat [47,48]. Thus, this marker could be used to select
for those patients in whom OFCs should be done with
extreme caution.
We acknowledge that the current study has the major
limitation of being a retrospective study and the clinical
