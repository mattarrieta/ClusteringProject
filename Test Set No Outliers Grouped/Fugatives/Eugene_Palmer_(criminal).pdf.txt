Background
Eugene Palmer's son, John Palmer, was married to Tammy Palmer,
and the couple lived together with their two children at a property
owned by Eugene in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stony_Point,_New_York"] Stony Point, New York. Eugene lived next
door to the couple. The relationship between John and Tammy
began to deteriorate, and they eventually started seeing other
people. Tammy filed for a restraining order against John, and this
enraged Eugene. Tammy also threatened to file for divorce and sue
for the land belonging to Eugene. Authorities say this started a
feud between Eugene and Tammy that would culminate in a
heated confrontation several days before the murder of Tammy.[3]
Murder
On the morning of Monday, September 24, 2012, Tammy walked
her two children to the school bus. It is believed that Eugene
Palmer hid in the woods, lying in wait to ambush her on her return
home. When Tammy walked back toward her home, Palmer
allegedly began firing his shotgun at her from a distance. The first
shot struck her in the arm, the second missed; but the third shot,
delivered at close range, hit her in the chest and proved fatal. After
the shooting, Palmer fled the scene in a green [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Ram"] Dodge Ram pickup;

 the truck would later be found abandoned outside Harriman State
Park in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockland_County,_New_York"] Rockland County. Apparently Palmer ditched the truck Currently a Top Ten Fugitive
and fled into the park on foot. When police called in search dogs,
they followed Palmer's scent to a campground in the woods. Despite multiple searches, no further trace of
Palmer has been found since.[4]
In September 2014, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court"] New York Supreme Court judge awarded Tammy's children $2.15 million
(equivalent to $2.46 million in 2021) — the estimated value of Palmer's entire estate — after determining
by a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preponderance_of_the_evidence"] preponderance of the evidence that Palmer killed their mother.[5]
Investigation
A federal arrest warrant was issued for Eugene Palmer on June 10, 2013.[6] Family members of his have
expressed their belief that he died in the park; however, according to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haverstraw,_New_York"] Haverstraw police, no body was ever
discovered after multiple searches of the area. Palmer depends on medications for a heart condition and
diabetes. Eugene Palmer is an outdoorsman—an experienced hunter, angler, and hiker—and is also
described as a car enthusiast. He has a deformed left thumb. Authorities believe he may be hiding in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida"] Florida
or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York"] Upstate New York, where he has relatives.[7]
On August 17, 2021, acting on a tip, the FBI searched the home of one of Palmer's granddaughters in
 Warwick, New York but ultimately found nothing.[8]
In popular culture
On March 25, 2020, Palmer was the focus of an episode of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Pursuit_with_John_Walsh"] In Pursuit with John Walsh.[9] On March 15,
2021, he was featured on the first episode of the revival of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Most_Wanted"] America's Most Wanted.[10] On August 25,
2021, Palmer was the subject of an episode of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsolved_Mysteries#Podcast"] Unsolved Mysteries podcast.[11]
