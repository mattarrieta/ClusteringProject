Background
Castillo was born on November 26, 1998, in Arizona. He speaks
fluent English and Spanish. In 2016, a then-17-year-old Castillo
worked at a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showmars"] Showmars restaurant in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina"] Charlotte, North Carolina, and
was co-workers with 23-year-old Truc Quan "Sandy" Ly Le. The
two reportedly briefly dated and at some point Le had lent Castillo
some money which he never paid back to her. Another co-worker
of theirs was 19-year-old Ahmia Feaster, who was Castillo's new
girlfriend after his split from Le.[3]
Disappearance and murder
On August 9, 2016, Castillo texted Le saying that he would like to
repay her the money she had previously loaned him. Le agreed to
meet Castillo at a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuikTrip"] QuikTrip located on Eastway Drive in Charlotte.
Castillo was picked up that afternoon by Feaster, who collected
him in her red [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Caliber"] Dodge Caliber and took him to the meeting. Le was
last seen alive at the QuikTrip where she agreed to meet Castillo. It
is believed that instead of repaying her, Castillo forced Le to
withdraw all the money from her bank account, possibly with a
gun. According to Le's uncle, her bank statements showed that she
withdrew $1,000 from an ATM. After this withdrawal there was

Aftermath  Currently a Top Ten Fugitive
After murdering Le, Castillo and Feaster drove from North Carolina to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona"] Phoenix, Arizona. They parked Le's
car at a bus shelter in Phoenix where it was later found abandoned on August 15. Castillo and Feaster then
made their way to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nogales,_Arizona"] Nogales, Arizona, where they crossed the border into Mexico. Surveillance footage
captured images of Castillo crossing the border into Mexico. He has not been seen since.[6] Investigators
believe that Castillo is still hiding in Mexico, possibly in the cities of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_de_los_Romo"] San Francisco de los Romo or
 Pabellón de Arteaga in the state of Aguascalientes. He may also be hiding in the states of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanajuato"] Guanajuato or
Veracruz.[7]
Investigation
Le was reported missing the day after she was murdered, and Castillo and Feaster were reported missing on
August 11 and 12. Feaster's Dodge Caliber was found abandoned on August 13 in the 11000 block of
Dulin Creek Boulevard in Charlotte. Later that day, Feaster and Castillo reportedly called their families
saying they were safe but did not know where they were.[8] After receiving the phone calls, both families
believed that the pair were being held captive and were forced to make the phone calls.[9]
On August 17, 2016, the body of Le was found in a wooded area in Cabarrus County. She had been shot
once in the head. Investigators say they believe the motive for the murder was simply robbery. On
November 2, 2016, Castillo was charged with first degree murder. He was later charged with unlawful
flight to avoid prosecution on February 10, 2017. Castillo is Charlotte's first ever fugitive to be named on
the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.[10]
On October 20, 2016, Feaster turned herself in to authorities in Aguascalientes, Mexico.[11] She got in
touch with her mother, who cooperated with U.S. authorities and arranged for her to be collected at an
 airport. On October 22, Feaster was extradited back to the U.S. and was arrested by the Harris County
Sheriff's Office near Houston, Texas. She was charged with accessory after the fact of felony murder and
larceny of a motor vehicle. Her bond was set at $25,000 for a larceny of a motor vehicle and $100,000 for
accessory after the fact. She was eventually transferred to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecklenburg_County,_North_Carolina"] Mecklenburg County Jail where she posted bond
and was released on January 18, 2017.[12]
According to Feaster, both she and Castillo had been staying with Castillo's cousins in Aguascalientes. At
some point during the two months they were staying down there, Castillo disappeared and went missing
once again.[12]
