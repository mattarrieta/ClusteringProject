Yaser Abdel Said
Yaser Abdel Said (Arabic: ‎السيد ‎عبد ‎ياسر; born January 27,
1957) is an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Americans"] Egyptian-American former [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi"] taxi driver accused of
murder. For 12 years, Said evaded arrest for the January 1, 2008,
fatal shootings of his two daughters, Amina (18) and Sarah (17).
 Their bodies were found in his abandoned taxi cab in Irving,
Texas, on the property of the Omni Mandalay Hotel (now the
Omni Las Colinas Hotel).[1][2] 
Yaser Abdel Said
Said disappeared after the killings and remained a fugitive from
law enforcement for 12 years, with six of those years being on the
 FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List for the fatal shootings. It is
 widely believed that Said killed his daughters as an honor
killing.[3]
Said, who was very controlling over his family, felt that his
daughters Amina and Sarah [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor_killing"] dishonored the family by refusing to
adhere to traditional Islamic cultural behavior. On January 1, 2008,
he lured them into his taxi cab on the pretense of taking them out
to eat, where it is alleged he fatally shot them.[4]
Said was captured on August 26, 2020, without incident in the
town of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin,_Texas"] Justin, Texas. His son, Islam, and Said's brother, Yassein,
were both arrested in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euless,_Texas"] Euless, Texas, for aiding a fugitive.[5] The
FBI said Said is in federal custody and will soon be transferred to
Dallas County. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_District_of_Texas"] Northern District of Texas will be the
jurisdiction in which Said will be tried for "Unlawful Flight to
Avoid Prosecution."[6][7]

Said was born in Sinai, Egypt. He came to the U.S. on a student 
Captured
visa in 1983. Said married Patricia "Tissie" Owens in February
1987 when he was 30 and she was 15.[8] Patricia later alleged that Said abused her during their marriage.[9]
Amina was born in 1989, and Sarah was born in 1990.[10][11] The couple also had a son named Islam
Said, born in 1988, and Said also had a previous daughter, born in 1987, with another woman. Said later
became a permanent resident, eventually gaining citizenship in 1997.[12][13]
Abuse of Amina and Sarah
According to reports, the girls had stated that their father physically and sexually abused them. Amina told
authorities she had been penetrated at least once.[3]
Said would often spy on his daughters by video or audio-taping them without their knowledge.[14][15]
Amina stated she was afraid of using the public telephone "because he [Said] gets in everywhere, he knows
everything".[16][17] She also wrote in emails that her father intended to kill her.[4] When she was 16, Said
took Amina to Egypt allegedly to arrange a marriage for her to a much older friend of his, but Amina
rejected the marriage.
Sarah got an after-school job working in a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenience_store"] convenience store. Said began video-taping her at work and
punished her for smiling too much at the customers.[18]
Amina began dating a boy named Joseph Moreno, whom she met while taking Taekwondo classes. When
Said was out of the country, she felt anxious about meeting Moreno, imagining that Said would be
watching her with binoculars.[14] Amina told Moreno not to call or text her if she sent a code word to him
because she was afraid that her father would go through her phone. Eventually, Said found a note that she
had written to Moreno. Amina told him that these notes were to an imaginary boyfriend. Said, not trusting
Amina, continued his search in order to uncover Amina's relationship.
Said moved his family 20 miles (32 km) to a new house in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewisville,_Texas"] Lewisville, Texas,[14] prompting Amina to
make plans to run away with Moreno, get married in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas"] Las Vegas, and start a new life. Moreno then dropped
out of high school in order to earn money, so that he could save up enough money in order to help her
leave. Moreno also stated: "[Said] regularly threatened to kill Amina, and she knew he meant it."[14] Amina
was worried that Moreno would be killed by her father, and she refused to give her father his name while
she was beaten, following Said's persistent accusations.
Murders of Amina and Sarah
After Christmas in 2007,[14] Amina and Sarah ran away with their mother Patricia to Tulsa, Oklahoma,
where Amina's boyfriend had relatives. Patricia allegedly told her daughters that December 31 was her
mother's death anniversary and that she wanted to drive to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Texas"] East Texas to put flowers on her grave.
However, Yaser, after having inundated Patricia with phone calls (from himself and other relatives) that
were initially unsuccessful, eventually convinced her to return home with the girls.[14] When Patricia
communicated this change of plans to her daughters, Sarah reluctantly agreed to return, while Amina
refused, ultimately seeking refuge in her friend's house. Patricia drove to the friend's house and pounded on
Page 3
the door, starting an argument with Amina to try to convince her to return to Said. Amina still refused to go.
Patricia insisted and stood unmoved in the doorway, saying that her father had forgiven her and would like
the girls to return home.[19]
On January 1, 2008, Yaser Said took Amina and Sarah to his taxi cab, kissed them, and told them he was
taking them out to eat. Patricia initially wanted to come along, but Said told her that he wanted to talk to the
girls himself. He drove them both to Irving, where he allegedly shot both girls to death in the taxi cab.
Amina died instantly, while Sarah managed to call 911 before she died, screaming "Help, my dad shot me!
I'm dying, I'm dying!"[20]
Said's taxi was soon discovered by another cab driver outside the service entrance of the Omni Mandalay
Hotel (now the Omni Las Colinas Hotel).[21][22]
Aftermath
After the murders, Said disappeared and although it was first assumed
he fled to Egypt, no such record was ever found. Owens filed for
 divorce in 2009. Alleged sightings of Said driving a taxi in New York
City and in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newark,_New_Jersey"] Newark, New Jersey, prompted the FBI to issue a
statement suggesting he could be in the area.[23][24][25] On December
4, 2014, Said was added to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI_Ten_Most_Wanted_Fugitives"] FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives with a
$100,000 reward for any information leading to his arrest.[24] Said
evaded capture by law enforcement for 12 years and spent six years on
the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list.
Capture
A break in the case came on August 14, 2017, when a maintenance
worker at an apartment complex in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford,_Texas"] Bedford, Texas, where Yaser's son,
Islam Said, rented an apartment, reported seeing a man matching Digital [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_progression"] age progression of Said
Yaser's description inside of Islam's apartment. When detectives released by FBI in 2014.
showed him a picture of Yaser Said, the worker identified him as the
man he had seen in the apartment. At approximately 6:30 p.m. that
evening, an agent came into the apartment to interview Islam. He was upset and allegedly refused to
cooperate. He then called someone, saying, “We have a problem.” At 1:00 a.m., a search warrant was
executed on the apartment, which was empty at the time. However, the police observed a sliding glass patio
door open. Below the patio, they noticed a shrub with broken branches, suggesting someone had jumped
off the patio and landed on the bush. Next to the flattened bush, they found a pair of eyeglasses, which they
collected as evidence. They collected evidence inside the apartment, including several cigarette butts and a
toothbrush. The FBI Laboratory in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantico,_Virginia"] Quantico, Virginia, compared the DNA from those items to the DNA of
Amina and Sarah, and determined the DNA most likely came from their biological father.[26]
Three years later, in August 2020, the police began 24-hour surveillance on a home in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin,_Texas"] Justin, Texas. They
observed Islam and Yassein entering and exiting the home and the shadow of another man inside the home
after the two men had left.[27] After a week of surveillance, the FBI obtained a search warrant and arrested
Yaser on August 26, 2020.[2][28] On the same day in nearby [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euless,_Texas"] Euless, Texas, they also arrested Islam, age
32, and Yassein Abdulfatah Said, age 59.[29] Said's son and brother were both charged with concealing a
person from arrest. Authorities suspect that other people helped Said evade arrest over the years, and a
federal criminal complaint said that Islam was in contact with two more of his father’s brothers.[29]

Trial
Yaser
Yaser was indicted on capital murder charges, making him eligible for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment"] death penalty.[30]
Islam
On January 19, 2021, Islam pleaded guilty to harboring a fugitive, conspiring to harbor a fugitive, and one
count of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice"] conspiracy to obstruct justice.[31] On April 27, 2021, he was sentenced to 10 years in federal
prison for the aforementioned charges.[32][33]
Yassein
According to his defense, Yassein Abdulfatah Said[33] claimed that he hated Yaser for what he did and that
he would have never helped him if he had known what would happen.[34] On February 4, 2021, he was
found guilty of conspiracy and harboring a fugitive. He was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison on June
4, 2021.[35]
In popular culture
The Price of Honor is a 2014 documentary about the murders of Sarah and Amina Said.[36][37]
In 2015, "The Hunt With John Walsh" profiled the killings and Yaser Said's fugitive status.[38]
