Bismuth
Bismuth is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"] chemical element with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol_(chemistry)"] symbol Bi
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number"] atomic number 83. It is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-transition_metal"] post-transition metal,
radioactive, and one of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pnictogen"] pnictogens with
chemical properties resembling its lighter [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_15"] group 15
siblings [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic"] arsenic and antimony. Elemental bismuth
may occur naturally, and its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfide"] sulfide and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxide"] oxide
 forms are important commercial ores. The free
element is 86% as dense as lead. It is a brittle metal
with a silvery-white color when freshly produced,
but surface [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"] oxidation can give it an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence"] iridescent tinge
in numerous colours. Bismuth is the most naturally
 diamagnetic element and has one of the lowest
values of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity"] thermal conductivity among metals.
Bismuth was long considered the element with the
highest atomic mass that is stable, but in 2003 it
was discovered to be extremely weakly
 radioactive: its only primordial isotope, bismuth-
209, decays via [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_decay"] alpha decay with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"] half-life more
 than a billion times the estimated age of the
universe.[4][5] Because of its tremendously long
half-life, bismuth may still be considered stable for
almost all purposes.[5]
Bismuth metal has been known since ancient
times, although it was often confused with lead
and tin, which share some physical properties. The
etymology is uncertain, but the word may come
from the German words weiße Masse or Wismuth
'white mass',  translated in the mid-sixteenth
century to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Latin"] New Latin bisemutum or bisemutium.

Main uses
Bismuth compounds account for about half the
production of bismuth. They are used in cosmetics;
pigments; and a few pharmaceuticals, notably
 bismuth subsalicylate, used to treat diarrhea.[5]
Bismuth's unusual propensity to expand as it
solidifies is responsible for some of its uses, such
as in the casting of printing type.[5] Bismuth has
unusually low [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"] toxicity for a heavy metal.[5] As the
toxicity of lead has become more apparent in
recent years, there is an increasing use of bismuth
alloys (presently about a  third of bismuth
production) as a replacement for lead.
History and etymology
Bismuth metal has been known since ancient
times; it was one of the first 10 metals to have been
discovered. The name bismuth dates from around
the 1660s and is of uncertain etymology; it
possibly comes from obsolete [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language"] German Bismuth,
Wismut, Wissmuth (early 16th century),  perhaps
related to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_High_German"] Old High German hwiz ("white").[6] The

 New Latin bisemutium (due to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgius_Agricola"] Georgius Agricola,
who Latinized many German mining and technical
words) is from the German Wismuth, perhaps from
weiße Masse, "white mass".[7][8]
The element was confused in early times with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin"] tin
and lead because of its resemblance to those
elements. Because bismuth has been known since
ancient times, no one person is credited with its
discovery. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgius_Agricola"] Agricola (1546) states that bismuth is a
distinct metal in a family of metals including tin
and lead. This was based on observation of the
metals and their physical properties.[9]
Miners in the age of alchemy also gave bismuth
the name tectum argenti, or "silver being made" in
the sense of silver still in the process of being
formed within the Earth.[10][11][12]
Bismuth was also known to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incas"] Incas and used
(along with the usual copper and tin) in a special
 bronze alloy for knives.[13]
Beginning with Johann Heinrich Pott in 1738,[14]
 Carl Wilhelm Scheele, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torbern_Olof_Bergman"] Torbern Olof Bergman,
the distinctness of lead and bismuth became clear,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Fran%C3%A7ois_Geoffroy"] Claude François Geoffroy demonstrated in
1753 that this metal is distinct from lead and
tin.[11][15][16]

tarnish showing many colors from yellow to
blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of
bismuth crystals is the result of a higher growth rate around the
outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the
thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal
cause different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection,
thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion"] burned in oxygen,
bismuth burns with a blue [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame"] flame and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth_oxide"] its oxide forms yellow
fumes.[15] Its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"] toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the
 periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.
No other metal is verified to be more naturally [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamagnetism"] diamagnetic than
bismuth.[15][17] ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdiamagnetism"] Superdiamagnetism is a different physical phenomenon.) Of any metal, it has one of the
lowest values of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity"] thermal conductivity (after manganese, and maybe [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptunium"] neptunium and plutonium) and the

highest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect"] Hall coefficient.[18] It has a high [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity"] electrical resistivity.[15]
When deposited in sufficiently thin layers on a substrate, bismuth is
a semiconductor, despite being a  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-transition_metal"] post-transition metal.[19]
Elemental bismuth is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density"] denser in the liquid phase than the solid, a
characteristic it shares with germanium, silicon, gallium, and
water.[20] Bismuth expands 3.32% on solidification; therefore, it
was long a component of low-melting [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typesetting"] typesetting alloys, where it
compensated for the contraction of the other alloying
 components[15][21][22][23] to form almost isostatic bismuth-lead

of bismuth. TC refers to the

temperature 
Though virtually unseen in nature, high-purity bismuth can form
distinctive, colorful [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_crystal"] hopper crystals. It is relatively nontoxic and has
a low melting point just above 271 °C, so crystals may be grown
using a household stove, although the resulting crystals will tend to
be of lower quality than lab-grown crystals.[24]
At ambient conditions, bismuth shares the same layered structure as the metallic forms of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic"] arsenic and
antimony,[25] crystallizing in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonal_crystal_system"] rhombohedral lattice[26] ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_symbol"] Pearson symbol hR6, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_group"] space group R3m No.
166) of the trigonal crystal system.[2] When compressed at room temperature, this Bi-I structure changes
 first to the monoclinic Bi-II at 2.55 GPa, then to the tetragonal Bi-III at 2.7 GPa, and finally to the body-
centered cubic Bi-V at 7.7 GPa. The corresponding transitions can be monitored via changes in electrical
conductivity; they are rather reproducible and abrupt and are therefore used for calibration of high-pressure
equipment.[27][28]
Chemical characteristics
Bismuth is stable to both dry and moist air at ordinary temperatures. When red-hot, it reacts with water to
make bismuth(III) oxide.[29]
2 Bi + 3 H2O → Bi2O3 + 3 H2
It reacts with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine"] fluorine to make [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth(V)_fluoride"] bismuth(V) fluoride at 500 °C or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth(III)_fluoride"] bismuth(III) fluoride at lower temperatures
(typically from Bi melts); with other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halogen"] halogens it yields only bismuth(III) halides.[30][31][32] The trihalides
are corrosive and easily react with moisture, forming [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxyhalides"] oxyhalides with the formula BiOX.[33]
4 Bi + 6 X2 → 4 BiX3 (X = F, Cl, Br, I)
4 BiX3 + 2 O2 → 4 BiOX + 4 X2
Bismuth dissolves in concentrated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid"] sulfuric acid to make bismuth(III) sulfate and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_dioxide"] sulfur dioxide.[29]
6 H2SO4 + 2 Bi → 6 H2O + Bi2(SO4)3 + 3 SO2

Isotopes
The only primordial [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope"] isotope of bismuth, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth-209"] bismuth-209, was traditionally regarded as the heaviest stable
isotope, but it had long been suspected[34] to be unstable on theoretical grounds. This was finally
demonstrated in 2003, when researchers at the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale in Orsay, France, measured
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_decay"] alpha emission [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"] half-life of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth-209"] 209
Bi to be 2.01 ×1019 years (3 Bq/Mg),[35][36] over a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1000000000_(number)"] billion times longer
than the current estimated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe"] age of the universe.[5] Owing to its extraordinarily long half-life, for all presently
known medical and industrial applications, bismuth can be treated as if it is stable and nonradioactive. The
radioactivity is of academic interest because bismuth is one of a few elements whose radioactivity was
suspected and theoretically predicted before being detected in the laboratory.[5] Bismuth has the longest
known alpha decay half-life, although [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_tellurium"] tellurium-128 has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_beta_decay"] double beta decay half-life of over
2.2 ×1024 years.[36] Bismuth's extremely long half-life means that less than approximately one-billionth of
the bismuth present at the formation of the planet Earth would have decayed into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thallium"] thallium since then.
Several isotopes of bismuth with short half-lives occur within the radioactive disintegration chains of
actinium, radium, and thorium, and more have been synthesized experimentally. Bismuth-213 is also found
on the decay chain of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptunium-237"] neptunium-237 and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium-233"] uranium-233.[37]
Commercially, the radioactive isotope bismuth-213 can be produced by bombarding [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium"] radium with
 bremsstrahlung photons from a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_particle_accelerator"] linear particle accelerator. In 1997, an antibody conjugate with bismuth-
213, which has a 45-minute half-life and decays with the emission of an alpha particle, was used to treat
 patients with leukemia. This isotope has also been tried in cancer treatment, for example, in the targeted
alpha therapy (TAT) program.[38][39]
Chemical compounds
Bismuth forms trivalent and pentavalent compounds, the trivalent ones being more common. Many of its
chemical properties are similar to those of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic"] arsenic and antimony, although they are less toxic than
derivatives of those lighter elements.
Oxides and sulfides
At elevated temperatures, the vapors of the metal combine rapidly with oxygen, forming the yellow
trioxide, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth(III)_oxide"] Bi2
O3
.[20][40] When molten, at temperatures above 710 °C, this oxide
and even platinum.[32] On reaction with a base, it forms two series of oxyanions:

 Bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl, see figure at right) and bismuth
oxynitrate (BiONO3) stoichiometrically appear as simple anionic
salts of the bismuthyl(III) cation (BiO+) which commonly occurs in
aqueous bismuth compounds. However, in the case of BiOCl, the
salt crystal forms in a structure of alternating plates of Bi, O, and Cl
atoms, with each oxygen coordinating with four bismuth atoms in
the adjacent plane. This mineral compound is used as a pigment
and cosmetic (see below).[45]
Bismuthine and bismuthides

Unlike the lighter [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pnictogen"] pnictogens nitrogen, phosphorus, and arsenic, but
similar to antimony, bismuth does not form a stable hydride.

In 2014 researchers discovered that sodium bismuthide can exist as a form of matter called a “three-
dimensional topological Dirac semi-metal” (3DTDS) that possess 3D [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_fermion"] Dirac fermions in bulk. It is a natural,
three-dimensional counterpart to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene"] graphene with similar [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_mobility"] electron mobility and velocity. Graphene and
 topological insulators (such as those in 3DTDS) are both crystalline materials that are electrically insulating
inside but conducting on the surface, allowing them to function as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor"] transistors and other electronic devices.
While sodium bismuthide (Na3
Bi) is too unstable to be used in devices without packaging, it can
demonstrate potential applications of 3DTDS systems, which offer distinct efficiency and fabrication
advantages over planar graphene in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor"] semiconductor and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spintronics"] spintronics applications.[46][47]
Halides
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halide"] halides of bismuth in low oxidation states have been shown to adopt unusual structures. What was
originally thought to be bismuth(I) chloride, BiCl, turns out to be a complex compound consisting of Bi59+
cations and BiCl25− 
and Bi2
Cl28− 
anions.[41][48] The Bi59+ 
cation has a distorted tricapped [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonal_prism"] trigonal prismatic

Hf3
Cl18
, which is prepared by reducing a mixture of

true monoiodide, BiI, which contains chains of Bi4

units. BiI decomposes upon heating to the triiodide,

, and elemental bismuth. A monobromide of the same structure also exists.[41]In oxidation state +3,
bismuth forms trihalides with

The oxidation state +5 is less frequently encountered. One such compound is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth_pentafluoride"] BiF5

Occurrence and production
In the Earth's crust, bismuth is about [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundances_of_the_elements_(data_page)"] twice as abundant as gold. The most
important [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore"] ores of bismuth are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuthinite"] bismuthinite and bismite.[15] Native bismuth
is known from Australia, Bolivia, and China.[51][52]

The difference between mining and refining production reflects Chunk of a broken bismuth ingot
bismuth's status as a byproduct of extraction of other metals such as
lead, copper, tin, molybdenum and tungsten.[55] World bismuth
production from refineries is a more complete and reliable statistic.[56][57][58]
Bismuth travels in crude lead bullion (which can contain up to 10% bismuth) through several stages of
refining, until it is removed by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroll-Betterton_process"] Kroll-Betterton process which separates the impurities as slag, or the
electrolytic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betts_process"] Betts process. Bismuth will behave similarly with another of its major metals, copper.[56] The
raw bismuth metal from both processes contains still considerable amounts of other metals, foremost lead.
By reacting the molten mixture with chlorine gas the metals are converted to their chlorides while bismuth
remains unchanged. Impurities can also be removed by various other methods for example with fluxes and
treatments yielding high-purity bismuth metal (over 99% Bi).
Price
The price for pure bismuth metal has been relatively stable through most of the 20th century, except for a
spike in the 1970s. Bismuth has always been produced mainly as a byproduct of lead refining, and thus the
price usually reflected the cost of recovery and the balance between production and demand.[59]
Prior to World War II, demand for bismuth was small and mainly pharmaceutical — bismuth compounds
were used to treat such conditions as digestive disorders, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexually_transmitted_diseases"] sexually transmitted diseases and burns. Minor
amounts of bismuth metal were consumed in fusible alloys for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_sprinkler"] fire sprinkler systems and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_(electrical)"] fuse wire. During
World War II bismuth was considered a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_material"] strategic material, used for solders, fusible alloys, medications and
atomic research. To stabilize the market, the producers set the price at $1.25 per pound ($2.75 /kg) during
the war and at $2.25 per pound ($4.96 /kg) from 1950 until 1964.[59]
Page 8
In the early 1970s, the price rose rapidly as a result of
increasing demand for bismuth as a metallurgical
additive to aluminium, iron and steel. This was followed
by a decline owing to increased world production,
stabilized consumption, and the recessions of 1980 and
1981–1982. In 1984, the price began to climb as
consumption increased worldwide, especially in the
United States and Japan. In the early 1990s, research
began on the evaluation of bismuth as a nontoxic
replacement for lead in ceramic glazes, fishing sinkers,
food-processing equipment, free-machining [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass"] brasses for
plumbing applications, lubricating greases, and shot for
 waterfowl hunting.[60] Growth in these areas remained
slow during the middle 1990s, in spite of the backing of
lead replacement by the United States federal
government, but intensified around 2005. This resulted
in a rapid and continuing increase in price.[59] 
World mine production and annual averages of
bismuth price (New York, not adjusted for
inflation).[59]
Recycling
Most bismuth is produced as a byproduct of other metal-extraction processes including the smelting of lead,
and also of tungsten and copper. Its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"] sustainability is dependent on increased recycling, which is
problematic.
It was once believed that bismuth could be practically recycled from the soldered joints in electronic
equipment. Recent efficiencies in solder application in electronics mean there is substantially less solder
deposited, and thus less to recycle. While recovering the silver from silver-bearing solder may remain
economic, recovering bismuth is substantially less so.[61]
Next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts with a fair bismuth content, such as bismuth
phosphomolybdate. Bismuth used in galvanizing, and as a free-machining metallurgical additive.
 Bismuth in uses where it is dispersed most widely include certain stomach medicines (bismuth
subsalicylate),  paints ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth_vanadate"] bismuth vanadate),  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearlescent"] pearlescent cosmetics ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth_oxychloride"] bismuth oxychloride),  and bismuth-
containing bullets. Recycling bismuth from these uses is impractical.
Applications
Bismuth has few commercial applications, and those applications that use it generally require small
quantities relative to other raw materials. In the United States, for example, 733 tonnes of bismuth were
consumed in 2016, of which 70% went into chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, pigments, and
cosmetics) and 11% into bismuth alloys.[62]
Some manufacturers use bismuth as a substitute in equipment for potable water systems such as valves to
meet "lead-free" mandates in the U.S. (began in 2014). This is a fairly large application since it covers all
residential and commercial building construction.
In the early 1990s, researchers began to evaluate bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in various
applications.

Medicines
Bismuth is an ingredient in some pharmaceuticals,[5] although the
use of some of these substances is declining.[45]
 Bismuth subsalicylate is used as an antidiarrheal;[5] it is
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_ingredient"] active ingredient in such "pink bismuth" preparations
as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepto-Bismol"] Pepto-Bismol, as well as the 2004 reformulation of
Kaopectate. It is also used to treat some other gastro-
 intestinal diseases like shigellosis[63] and cadmium
poisoning.[5] The mechanism of action of this substance
 is still not well documented, although an oligodynamic
effect (toxic effect of small doses of heavy metal ions on
microbes) may be involved in at least some cases.
 Salicylic acid from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrolysis"] hydrolysis of the compound is
antimicrobial for toxogenic E. coli, an important pathogen
in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveler%27s_diarrhea"] traveler's diarrhea.[64]
 A combination of bismuth subsalicylate and bismuth
 subcitrate is used to treat the bacteria causing peptic
ulcers.
 Bibrocathol is an organic bismuth-containing compound
used to treat eye infections.[65]
 Bismuth subgallate, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_ingredient"] active ingredient in Devrom, is
used as an internal deodorant to treat malodor from
 flatulence and feces. 
18th-century engraving of bismuth

was used to treat some digestive
complaints.
Bismuth compounds (including sodium bismuth tartrate) were formerly used to treat
syphilis.[66][67] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic"] Arsenic combined with either bismuth or mercury was a mainstay of syphilis
treatment from the 1920s until the advent of penicillin in 1943.[68]
"Milk of bismuth" (an aqueous suspension of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth_hydroxide"] bismuth hydroxide and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth_subcarbonate"] bismuth subcarbonate)
was marketed as an alimentary cure-all in the early 20th century.
 Bismuth subnitrate (Bi5O(OH)9(NO3)4) and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth_subcarbonate"] bismuth subcarbonate (Bi2O2(CO3)) are also
used in medicine.[15]
Cosmetics and pigments
 Bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) is sometimes used in cosmetics, as a pigment in paint for eye shadows, hair
sprays and nail polishes.[5][45][69][70] This compound is found as the mineral bismoclite and in crystal form
contains layers of atoms (see figure above) that refract light chromatically, resulting in an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescent"] iridescent
appearance similar to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacre"] nacre of pearl. It was used as a cosmetic in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt"] ancient Egypt and in many places since.
Bismuth white (also "Spanish white") can refer to either bismuth oxychloride or  bismuth oxynitrate
(BiONO3), when used as a white pigment. Bismuth vanadate is used as a light-stable non-reactive paint
pigment (particularly for artists' paints), often as a replacement for the more toxic cadmium sulfide yellow
and orange-yellow pigments. The most common variety in artists' paints is a lemon yellow, visually
indistinguishable from its cadmium-containing alternative.
Metal and alloys
Page 10
Bismuth is used in metal alloys with other metals such as iron. These alloys are used in automatic sprinkler
systems for fires. It forms the largest part (50%) of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose%27s_metal"] Rose's metal, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusible_alloy"] fusible alloy, which also contains 25–
28% lead and 22–25% tin. It was also used to make [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth_bronze"] bismuth bronze which was used in the Bronze Age.
Lead replacement
The density difference between lead (11.32 g/cm3) and bismuth (9.78 g/cm3) is small enough that for many
 ballistics and weighting applications, bismuth can substitute for lead. For example, it can replace lead as a
dense material in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_sinker"] fishing sinkers. It has been used as a replacement for lead in shot, bullets and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less-lethal"] less-lethal
 riot gun ammunition. The Netherlands, Denmark, England, Wales, the United States, and many other
 countries now prohibit the use of lead shot for the hunting of wetland birds, as many birds are prone to lead
poisoning owing to mistaken ingestion of lead (instead of small stones and grit) to aid digestion, or even
prohibit the use of lead for all hunting, such as in the Netherlands. Bismuth-tin alloy shot is one alternative
that provides similar ballistic performance to lead. (Another less expensive but also more poorly performing
alternative is "steel" shot, which is actually soft iron.) Bismuth's lack of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleability"] malleability does, however, make it
unsuitable for use in expanding hunting bullets.
Bismuth, as a dense element of high atomic weight, is used in bismuth-impregnated latex shields to shield
from X-ray in medical examinations, such as CTs, mostly as it is considered non-toxic.[71]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"] European Union's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restriction_of_Hazardous_Substances_Directive"] Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) for reduction of lead has
broadened bismuth's use in electronics as a component of low-melting point solders, as a replacement for
traditional tin-lead solders.[62] Its low toxicity will be especially important for solders to be used in food
processing equipment and copper water pipes, although it can also be used in other applications including
those in the automobile industry, in the European Union, for example.[72]
Bismuth has been evaluated as a replacement for lead in free-machining [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass"] brasses for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumbing"] plumbing
applications,[73] although it does not equal the performance of leaded steels.[72]
Other metal uses and specialty alloys
Many bismuth [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy"] alloys have low [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point"] melting points and are found in specialty applications such as solders. Many
automatic sprinklers, electric fuses, and safety devices in fire detection and suppression systems contain the
eutectic In19.1-Cd5.3-Pb22.6-Sn8.3-Bi44.7 alloy that melts at 47 °C (117 °F)[15] This is a convenient
temperature since it is unlikely to be exceeded in normal living conditions. Low-melting alloys, such as Bi-
Cd-Pb-Sn alloy which melts at 70 °C, are also used in automotive and aviation industries. Before
deforming a thin-walled metal part, it is filled with a melt or covered with a thin layer of the alloy to reduce
the chance of breaking. Then the alloy is removed by submerging the part in boiling water.[74]
Bismuth is used to make [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-machining_steel"] free-machining steels and free-machining aluminium alloys for precision
machining properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The
shrinking on solidification in lead and the expansion of bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead
and bismuth are often used in similar quantities.[75][76] Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of
bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging.
Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds.[74] Bismuth is
also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons[62] and as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocouple"] thermocouple material.[15]
Bismuth is also used in aluminium-silicon cast alloys in order to refine silicon morphology. However, it
indicated a poisoning effect on modification of strontium.[77][78] Some bismuth alloys, such as Bi35-Pb37-
Sn25, are combined with non-sticking materials such as mica, glass and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitreous_enamel"] enamels because they easily wet
them allowing to make joints to other parts. Addition of bismuth to caesium enhances the quantum yield of
Page 11
caesium cathodes.[45] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintering"] Sintering of bismuth and manganese powders at 300 °C produces a permanent
magnet and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetostrictive"] magnetostrictive material, which is used in ultrasonic generators and receivers working in the
10–100 kHz range and in magnetic and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_data_storage"] holographic memory devices.[79]
Other uses as compounds
Bismuth is included in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSCCO"] BSCCO (bismuth strontium
calcium copper oxide) which is a group of similar
superconducting compounds discovered in 1988 that
exhibit the highest superconducting transition
temperatures.[80]
 Bismuth subnitrate is a component of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceramic_glaze"] glazes that
produces an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iridescence"] iridescence and is used as a pigment in
paint.
 Bismuth telluride is a semiconductor and an excellent
 thermoelectric material.[45][81] Bi2Te3 diodes are used in
mobile refrigerators, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU"] CPU coolers, and as detectors in
 infrared spectrophotometers.[45] 
Bismuth vanadate, a yellow pigment
 Bismuth oxide, in its delta form, is a solid electrolyte for oxygen. This form normally breaks
down below a high-temperature threshold, but can be electrodeposited well below this
temperature in a highly alkaline solution.
 Bismuth germanate is a scintillator, widely used in X-ray and gamma ray detectors.
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismuth_vanadate"] Bismuth vanadate is an opaque yellow pigment used by some artists' oil, acrylic, and
watercolor paint companies, primarily as a replacement for the more toxic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium_sulfide"] cadmium sulfide
yellows in the greenish-yellow (lemon) to orange-toned yellow range. It performs practically
identically to the cadmium pigments, such as in terms of resistance to degradation from UV
exposure, opacity, tinting strength, and lack of reactivity when mixed with other pigments.
The most commonly-used variety by artists' paint makers is lemon in color. In addition to
being a replacement for several cadmium yellows, it also serves as a non-toxic visual
replacement for the older chromate pigments made with zinc, lead, and strontium. If a green
pigment and barium sulfate (for increased transparency) are added it can also serve as a
replacement for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barium_chromate"] barium chromate, which possesses a more greenish cast than the others. In
comparison with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_chromates"] lead chromates, it does not blacken due to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_sulfide"] hydrogen sulfide in the air (a
process accelerated by UV exposure) and possesses a particularly brighter color than them,
especially the lemon, which is the most translucent, dull, and fastest to blacken due to the
higher percentage of lead sulfate required to produce that shade. It is also used, on a limited
basis due to its cost, as a vehicle paint pigment.[82][83]
A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalyst"] catalyst for making [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylic_fibers"] acrylic fibers.[15]

Toxicology and ecotoxicology
See also bismuthia, a rare dermatological condition that results from the prolonged use of
bismuth.
Page 12
Scientific literature indicates that some of the compounds of bismuth are less toxic to humans via ingestion
than other heavy metals (lead, arsenic, antimony, etc.)[5] presumably due to the comparatively low
solubility of bismuth salts.[89] Its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_half-life"] biological half-life for whole-body retention is reported to be 5 days but it
can remain in the kidney for years in people treated with bismuth compounds.[90]
Bismuth poisoning can occur and has according to some reports been common in relatively recent
times.[89][91] As with lead, bismuth poisoning can result in the formation of a black deposit on the gingiva,
known as a bismuth line.[92][93][94] Poisoning may be treated with dimercaprol; however, evidence for
benefit is unclear.[95][96]
Bismuth's environmental impacts are not well known; it may be less likely to bioaccumulate than some
other heavy metals, and this is an area of active research.[97][98]
Bioremediation
