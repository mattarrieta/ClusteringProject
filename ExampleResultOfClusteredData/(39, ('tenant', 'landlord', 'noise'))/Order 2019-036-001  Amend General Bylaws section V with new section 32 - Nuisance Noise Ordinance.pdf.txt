sound definition sound physical parameter produced vibrating surface transfer energy form air pressure wave fluctuate barometric pressure degree within frequency range perceived human auditory system sound heard sound level meter slm asound level meter calibrated electrical device used measure loudness noise purpose bylaw slm must capable measuring expressing noise level weighted decibel using rms slow time constant accordance type better accuracy requirement ansi standard addition integrating slm must used time averaged noise metric leq percentile reported audible frequency range weighting human being perceive noise fluctuating air pressure wave within called audible frequency range hertz orcycles per second however people hear noise equally well frequency frequency weighting adjustment standardized ansi standard account human responding le sensitively lower higher frequency range frequency weighted adjustment referred weighting result expressed weighted decibel decibel magnitude loudness noise expressed unit decibel decibel relate actual fluctuating air pressure level standardized reference air pressure level micro pascal human being hear noise tremendously large range air
