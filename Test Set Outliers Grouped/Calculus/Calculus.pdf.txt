Calculus
Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or "the calculus of infinitesimals", is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics"] mathematical
study of continuous change, in the same way that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"] geometry is the study of shape, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra"] algebra is the study
of generalizations of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_operations"] arithmetic operations.
It has two major branches, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_calculus"] differential calculus and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_calculus"] integral calculus; differential calculus concerns
instantaneous rates of change, and the slopes of curves, while integral calculus concerns accumulation of
quantities, and areas under or between curves. These two branches are related to each other by the
 fundamental theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fundamental notions of convergence of infinite
sequences and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_(mathematics)"] infinite series to a well-defined limit.[1]
 Infinitesimal calculus was developed independently in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz.[2][3] Later work, including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(%CE%B5,_%CE%B4)-definition_of_limit"] codifying the idea of limits, put these developments on a more
solid conceptual footing. Today, calculus has widespread uses in science, engineering, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science"] social science.[4]
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_education"] mathematics education, calculus denotes courses of elementary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis"] mathematical analysis, which are mainly
devoted to the study of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"] functions and limits. The word calculus is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"] Latin for "small pebble" (the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminutive"] diminutive
of calx, meaning "stone"), a meaning which still [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_(medicine)"] persists in medicine. Because such pebbles were used for
counting out distances,[5] tallying votes, and doing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus"] abacus arithmetic, the word came to mean a method of
computation. In this sense, it was used in English at least as early as 1672, several years prior to the
publications of Leibniz and Newton.[6]
In addition to the differential calculus and integral calculus, the term is also used for naming specific
methods of calculation and related theories which seek to model a particular concept in terms of
 mathematics. Examples of this convention include propositional calculus, Ricci calculus, calculus of
variations, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus"] lambda calculus, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_calculus"] process calculus. Furthermore, the term "calculus" has variously been
applied in ethics and philosophy, for such systems as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Bentham"] Bentham's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felicific_calculus"] felicific calculus, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_calculus"] ethical calculus.

History
Modern calculus was developed in 17th-century Europe by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton"] Isaac Newton and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz"] Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz
(independently of each other, first publishing around the same time) but elements of it appeared in ancient
Greece, then in China and the Middle East, and still later again in medieval Europe and in India.
Ancient precursors
Egypt
 Calculations of volume and area, one goal of integral calculus, can be found in the Egyptian Moscow
papyrus (c. 1820 BC), but the formulae are simple instructions, with no indication as to how they were
obtained.[7][8]
Greece
Laying the foundations for integral calculus and foreshadowing the concept of the limit, ancient Greek
mathematician [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudoxus_of_Cnidus"] Eudoxus of Cnidus (c. 390 – 337 BCE) developed the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion"] method of exhaustion to prove the
formulas for cone and pyramid volumes.
During the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period"] Hellenistic period, this method was further developed by Archimedes, who combined it with a
concept of the indivisibles—a precursor to infinitesimals—allowing him to solve several problems now
treated by integral calculus. These problems include, for example, calculating the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_gravity"] center of gravity of a solid
hemisphere, the center of gravity of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustum"] frustum of a circular paraboloid, and the area of a region bounded by
a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabola"] parabola and one of its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_line"] secant lines.[9]
China
Page 3
 The method of exhaustion was later discovered independently in China by Liu
Hui in the 3rd century AD in order to find the area of a circle.[10][11] In the 5th
century AD, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zu_Gengzhi"] Zu Gengzhi, son of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zu_Chongzhi"] Zu Chongzhi, established a method[12][13]
that would later be called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalieri%27s_principle"] Cavalieri's principle to find the volume of a sphere.
Medieval
Middle East
In the Middle East, Hasan Ibn al-Haytham, Latinized as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alhazen"] Alhazen (c. 965 –
c. 1040 CE) derived a formula for the sum of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_power"] fourth powers. He used the
results to carry out what would now be called an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral"] integration of this function,
where the formulae for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed
him to calculate the volume of a paraboloid.[14]
India
In the 14th century, Indian mathematicians gave a non-rigorous method,
resembling differentiation, applicable to some trigonometric functions.
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_School_of_Astronomy_and_Mathematics"] Madhava of Sangamagrama and the Kerala School of Astronomy and
Mathematics thereby stated components of calculus. A complete theory
encompassing these components is now well known in the Western world as
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series"] Taylor series or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_series"] infinite series approximations.[15][16] However, they
were not able to "combine many differing ideas under the two unifying
themes of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"] derivative and the integral, show the connection between the
two, and turn calculus into the great problem-solving tool we have
today".[14] 
Archimedes used the
 method of exhaustion to
calculate the area under
a parabola.
Modern
 Johannes Kepler's work Stereometrica Doliorum formed the basis of integral
calculus.[18] Kepler developed a method to calculate the area of an ellipse by
adding up the lengths of many radii drawn from a focus of the ellipse.[19] 
Alhazen, 11th-century
Arab mathematician and
physicist
A significant work was a treatise, the
origin being Kepler's methods,[19]
written by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonaventura_Cavalieri"] Bonaventura Cavalieri,
who argued that volumes and areas
should be computed as the sums of
the volumes and areas of
infinitesimally thin cross-sections.
The ideas were similar to 
The calculus was the first achievement of modern mathematics
and it is difficult to overestimate its importance. I think it
defines more unequivocally than anything else the inception of
modern mathematics, and the system of mathematical analysis,
which is its logical development, still constitutes the greatest
technical advance in exact thinking.

treatise is believed to have been lost
in the 13th century, and was only 
—[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann"] John von Neumann[17]
rediscovered in the early 20th
century, and so would have been
unknown to Cavalieri. Cavalieri's work was not well respected since his methods could lead to erroneous
results, and the infinitesimal quantities he introduced were disreputable at first.
Page 4
 The formal study of calculus brought together Cavalieri's infinitesimals with the calculus of finite
differences developed in Europe at around the same time. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Fermat"] Pierre de Fermat, claiming that he borrowed from
Diophantus, introduced the concept of adequality, which represented equality up to an infinitesimal error
term.[20] The combination was achieved by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallis"] John Wallis, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Barrow"] Isaac Barrow, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gregory_(astronomer_and_mathematician)"] James Gregory, the latter two

The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_rule"] product rule and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule"] chain rule,[23] the notions of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_derivative"] higher derivatives
 and Taylor series,[24] and of analytic functions[25] were used by Isaac
Newton in an idiosyncratic notation which he applied to solve
problems of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics"] mathematical physics. In his works, Newton rephrased his
ideas to suit the mathematical idiom of the time, replacing calculations
with infinitesimals by equivalent geometrical arguments which were
considered beyond reproach. He used the methods of calculus to solve
the problem of planetary motion, the shape of the surface of a rotating
fluid, the oblateness of the earth, the motion of a weight sliding on a
 cycloid, and many other problems discussed in his Principia
Mathematica (1687). In other work, he developed series expansions
for functions, including fractional and irrational powers, and it was
clear that he understood the principles of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series"] Taylor series. He did not
publish all these discoveries, and at this time infinitesimal methods
were still considered disreputable.[26]

 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who
was originally accused of
 plagiarism by Newton.[27] He is now regarded as an independent
inventor of and contributor to calculus. His contribution was to
provide a clear set of rules for working with infinitesimal quantities,
allowing the computation of second and higher derivatives, and
providing the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_rule"] product rule and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule"] chain rule, in their differential and
integral forms. Unlike Newton, Leibniz put painstaking effort into his
choices of notation.[28]

approximating polynomial series. 
Today, Leibniz and Newton are usually both given credit for
independently inventing and developing calculus. Newton was the
first to apply calculus to general [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"] physics and Leibniz developed much
of the notation used in calculus today. The basic insights that both
Newton and Leibniz provided were the laws of differentiation and
integration, second and higher derivatives, and the notion of an
When Newton and Leibniz first published their results, there was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_v._Leibniz_calculus_controversy"] great controversy over which
mathematician (and therefore which country) deserved credit. Newton derived his results first (later to be
published in his [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_Fluxions"] Method of Fluxions), but Leibniz published his "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Methodus_pro_Maximis_et_Minimis"] Nova Methodus pro Maximis et Minimis"
first. Newton claimed Leibniz stole ideas from his unpublished notes, which Newton had shared with a few
members of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society"] Royal Society. This controversy divided English-speaking mathematicians from continental
European mathematicians for many years, to the detriment of English mathematics.[29] A careful
examination of the papers of Leibniz and Newton shows that they arrived at their results independently,
with Leibniz starting first with integration and Newton with differentiation. It is Leibniz, however, who
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_function"]
Page 5
gave the new discipline its name. Newton called his calculus "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_fluxions"] the science of fluxions", a term that endured
in English schools into the 19th century.[30]: 100  The first complete treatise on calculus to be written in
English and use the Leibniz notation was not published until 1815.[31]
Since the time of Leibniz and Newton, many mathematicians have contributed to the continuing
 development of calculus. One of the first and most complete works on both infinitesimal and integral
calculus was written in 1748 by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Gaetana_Agnesi"] Maria Gaetana Agnesi.[32][33]
Foundations
In calculus, foundations refers to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigorous#Mathematical_rigour"] rigorous development of the subject from
 axioms and definitions. In early calculus the use of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal"] infinitesimal quantities was
thought unrigorous, and was fiercely criticized by a number of authors, most
notably [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Rolle"] Michel Rolle and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Berkeley"] Bishop Berkeley. Berkeley famously described
infinitesimals as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_of_departed_quantities"] ghosts of departed quantities in his book [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Analyst"] The Analyst in
1734. Working out a  rigorous foundation for calculus occupied
mathematicians for much of the century following Newton and Leibniz, and is
still to some extent an active area of research today.[34]  [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Gaetana_Agnesi"] Maria Gaetana Agnesi
Several mathematicians, including Maclaurin, tried to prove the soundness of
using infinitesimals, but it would not be until 150 years later when, due to the work of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustin_Louis_Cauchy"] Cauchy and
Weierstrass, a way was finally found to avoid mere "notions" of infinitely small quantities.[35] The
foundations of differential and integral calculus had been laid. In Cauchy's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cours_d%27Analyse"] Cours d'Analyse, we find a
broad range of foundational approaches, including a definition of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"] continuity in terms of infinitesimals, and a
(somewhat imprecise) prototype of an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(%CE%B5,_%CE%B4)-definition_of_limit"] (ε, δ)-definition of limit in the definition of differentiation.[36] In his
work Weierstrass formalized the concept of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function"] limit and eliminated infinitesimals (although his definition can
actually validate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nilsquare"] nilsquare infinitesimals). Following the work of Weierstrass, it eventually became common
to base calculus on limits instead of infinitesimal quantities, though the subject is still occasionally called
"infinitesimal calculus". [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernhard_Riemann"] Bernhard Riemann used these ideas to give a precise definition of the integral.[37]
It was also during this period that the ideas of calculus were generalized to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_plane"] complex plane with the
development of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_analysis"] complex analysis.[38]
In modern mathematics, the foundations of calculus are included in the field of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_analysis"] real analysis, which contains
full definitions and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof"] proofs of the theorems of calculus. The reach of calculus has also been greatly
extended. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Lebesgue"] Henri Lebesgue invented [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_theory"] measure theory, based on earlier developments by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Borel"] Émile Borel, and
used it to define integrals of all but the most [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathological_(mathematics)"] pathological functions.[39] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Schwartz"] Laurent Schwartz introduced
distributions, which can be used to take the derivative of any function whatsoever.[40]
 Limits are not the only rigorous approach to the foundation of calculus. Another way is to use Abraham
Robinson's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_analysis"] non-standard analysis. Robinson's approach, developed in the 1960s, uses technical machinery
from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic"] mathematical logic to augment the real number system with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinitesimal"] infinitesimal and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity"] infinite numbers, as in
the original Newton-Leibniz conception. The resulting numbers are called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreal_number"] hyperreal numbers, and they can
 be used to give a Leibniz-like development of the usual rules of calculus.[41] There is also smooth
infinitesimal analysis, which differs from non-standard analysis in that it mandates neglecting higher-power
infinitesimals during derivations.[34]
Significance
Page 6
While many of the ideas of calculus had been developed earlier in Greece, China, India, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_mathematics"] Iraq, Persia, and
 Japan, the use of calculus began in Europe, during the 17th century, when Isaac Newton and Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz built on the work of earlier mathematicians to introduce its basic principles.[11][26][42] The
development of calculus was built on earlier concepts of instantaneous motion and area underneath curves.
Applications of differential calculus include computations involving [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"] velocity and acceleration, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope"] slope of
a curve, and optimization. Applications of integral calculus include computations involving area, volume,
 arc length, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass"] center of mass, work, and pressure. More advanced applications include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_series"] power series and
 Fourier series.
Calculus is also used to gain a more precise understanding of the nature of space, time, and motion. For
centuries, mathematicians and philosophers wrestled with paradoxes involving [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_by_zero"] division by zero or sums of
infinitely many numbers. These questions arise in the study of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(physics)"] motion and area. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek"] ancient Greek
philosopher [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_of_Elea"] Zeno of Elea gave several famous examples of such paradoxes. Calculus provides tools,
especially the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)"] limit and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_series"] infinite series, that resolve the paradoxes.[43]
Principles
Limits and infinitesimals
Calculus is usually developed by working with very small quantities. Historically, the first method of doing
so was by infinitesimals. These are objects which can be treated like real numbers but which are, in some
sense, "infinitely small". For example, an infinitesimal number could be greater than 0, but less than any
number in the sequence 1, 1/2, 1/3, ... and thus less than any positive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_number"] real number. From this point of view,
calculus is a collection of techniques for manipulating infinitesimals. The symbols and were taken to
be infinitesimal, and the derivative was simply their ratio.[34]
The infinitesimal approach fell out of favor in the 19th century because it was difficult to make the notion
of an infinitesimal precise. In the late 19th century, infinitesimals were replaced within academia by the
 epsilon, delta approach to limits. Limits describe the behavior of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)"] function at a certain input in terms of its
 values at nearby inputs. They capture small-scale behavior using the intrinsic structure of the real number
system (as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space"] metric space with the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least-upper-bound_property"] least-upper-bound property). In this treatment, calculus is a collection of
techniques for manipulating certain limits. Infinitesimals get replaced by sequences of smaller and smaller
numbers, and the infinitely small behavior of a function is found by taking the limiting behavior for these
sequences. Limits were thought to provide a more rigorous foundation for calculus, and for this reason they
became the standard approach during the 20th century. However, the infinitesimal concept was revived in
the 20th century with the introduction of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_analysis"] non-standard analysis and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_infinitesimal_analysis"] smooth infinitesimal analysis, which
provided solid foundations for the manipulation of infinitesimals.[34]
Differential calculus
Differential calculus is the study of the definition, properties, and applications of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative"] derivative of a
function. The process of finding the derivative is called differentiation. Given a function and a point in the
domain, the derivative at that point is a way of encoding the small-scale behavior of the function near that
point. By finding the derivative of a function at every point in its domain, it is possible to produce a new
function, called the derivative function or just the derivative of the original function. In formal terms, the
derivative is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_operator"] linear operator which takes a function as its input and produces a second function as its
output. This is more abstract than many of the processes studied in elementary algebra, where functions
usually input a number and output another number. For example, if the doubling function is given the input
Page 7
three, then it outputs six, and if the squaring
function is given the input three, then it
outputs nine. The derivative, however, can
take the squaring function as an input. This
means that the derivative takes all the
information of the squaring function—such
as that two is sent to four, three is sent to
nine, four is sent to sixteen, and so on—and
uses this information to produce another
function. The function produced by
differentiating the squaring function turns out
to be the doubling function.[44]: 32 
In more explicit terms the "doubling
function" may be denoted by g(x) = 2x and
the "squaring function" by f(x) = x2. The
"derivative" now takes the function f(x), 
Tangent line at (x0, f(x0)). The derivative f′(x) of a curve at a
point is the slope (rise over run) of the line tangent to that
curve at that point.
defined by the expression "x2", as an input,
that is all the information—such as that two is sent to four, three is sent to nine, four is sent to sixteen, and
so on—and uses this information to output another function, the function g(x) = 2x, as will turn out.
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_notation"] Lagrange's notation, the symbol for a derivative is an apostrophe-like mark called a prime. Thus, the
derivative of a function called f is denoted by f′, pronounced "f prime". For instance, if f(x) = x2 is the
squaring function, then f′(x) = 2x is its derivative (the doubling function g from above).
If the input of the function represents time, then the derivative represents change with respect to time. For
example, if f is a function that takes a time as input and gives the position of a ball at that time as output,
then the derivative of f is how the position is changing in time, that is, it is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity"] velocity of the ball.[44]: 18–20 
If a function is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function"] linear (that is, if the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_of_a_function"] graph of the function is a straight line), then the function can be written
as y = mx + b, where x is the independent variable, y is the dependent variable, b is the y-intercept, and:
This gives an exact value for the slope of a straight line. If the graph of the function is not a straight line,
however, then the change in y divided by the change in x varies. Derivatives give an exact meaning to the
notion of change in output with respect to change in input. To be concrete, let f be a function, and fix a
point a in the domain of f. (a, f(a)) is a point on the graph of the function. If h is a number close to zero,
then a + h is a number close to a. Therefore, (a + h, f(a + h)) is close to (a, f(a)). The slope between
these two points is
This expression is called a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_quotient"] difference quotient. A line through two points on a curve is called a secant line,
so m is the slope of the secant line between (a, f(a)) and (a + h, f(a + h)). The secant line is only an
approximation to the behavior of the function at the point a because it does not account for what happens
between a and a + h. It is not possible to discover the behavior at a by setting h to zero because this
would require [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividing_by_zero"] dividing by zero, which is undefined. The derivative is defined by taking the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(mathematics)"] limit as h tends
to zero, meaning that it considers the behavior of f for all small values of h and extracts a consistent value
for the case when h equals zero:
Page 8
Geometrically, the derivative is the slope of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_line"] tangent line to the graph of f at a. The tangent line is a limit
of secant lines just as the derivative is a limit of difference quotients. For this reason, the derivative is
sometimes called the slope of the function f.
Here is a particular example, the derivative of the squaring function at the input 3. Let f(x) = x2 be the
squaring function.
The slope of the tangent line to the squaring function
at the point (3, 9) is 6, that is to say, it is going up six
times as fast as it is going to the right. The limit
process just described can be performed for any point
in the domain of the squaring function. This defines
the derivative function of the squaring function or just
the derivative of the squaring function for short. A
computation similar to the one above shows that the
derivative of the squaring function is the doubling
function.
Leibniz notation
A common notation, introduced by Leibniz, for the
derivative in the example above is 
The derivative f′(x) of a curve at a point is the
slope of the line tangent to that curve at that point.
This slope is determined by considering the
limiting value of the slopes of secant lines. Here
the function involved (drawn in red) is
f(x) = x3 − x. The tangent line (in green) which
passes through the point (−3/2, −15/8) has a slope
of 23/4. Note that the vertical and horizontal scales
in this image are different.
In an approach based on limits, the symbol 
dy
dx is to be interpreted not as the quotient of two numbers but as
a shorthand for the limit computed above. Leibniz, however, did intend it to represent the quotient of two
infinitesimally small numbers, dy being the infinitesimally small change in y caused by an infinitesimally
small change dx applied to x. We can also think of 
d
dx as a differentiation operator, which takes a function
as an input and gives another function, the derivative, as the output. For example:
Page 9
In this usage, the dx in the denominator is read as "with respect to x". Another example of correct notation
could be:
Even when calculus is developed using limits rather than infinitesimals, it is common to manipulate
symbols like dx and dy as if they were real numbers; although it is possible to avoid such manipulations,
they are sometimes notationally convenient in expressing operations such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_derivative"] total derivative.
Integral calculus
Integral calculus is the study of the definitions, properties, and applications of two related concepts, the
indefinite integral and the definite integral. The process of finding the value of an integral is called
integration. In technical language, integral calculus studies two related [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_operator"] linear operators.
The indefinite integral, also known as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiderivative"] antiderivative, is the inverse operation to the derivative. F is an
indefinite integral of f when f is a derivative of F. (This use of lower- and upper-case letters for a function
and its indefinite integral is common in calculus.)
The definite integral inputs a function and outputs a number, which gives the algebraic sum of areas
between the graph of the input and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-axis"] x-axis. The technical definition of the definite integral involves the
 limit of a sum of areas of rectangles, called a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum"] Riemann sum.[45]: 282 
A motivating example is the distance traveled in a given time. If the speed is constant, only multiplication is
needed:
But if the speed changes, a more powerful method of finding the distance is necessary. One such method is
to approximate the distance traveled by breaking up the time into many short intervals of time, then
multiplying the time elapsed in each interval by one of the speeds in that interval, and then taking the sum
(a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sum"] Riemann sum) of the approximate distance traveled in each interval. The basic idea is that if only a short
time elapses, then the speed will stay more or less the same. However, a Riemann sum only gives an
approximation of the distance traveled. We must take the limit of all such Riemann sums to find the exact
distance traveled. 
When velocity is constant, the total distance traveled over the given
time interval can be computed by multiplying velocity and time. For
example, travelling a steady 50 mph for 3 hours results in a total
distance of 150 miles. In the diagram on the left, when constant
velocity and time are graphed, these two values form a rectangle
with height equal to the velocity and width equal to the time elapsed.
Therefore, the product of velocity and time also calculates the
rectangular area under the (constant) velocity curve. This connection
between the area under a curve and distance traveled can be
Constant velocity  extended to any irregularly shaped region exhibiting a fluctuating
velocity over a given time period. If f(x) in the diagram on the right
represents speed as it varies over time, the distance traveled (between
the times represented by a and b) is the area of the shaded region s.
Page 10
To approximate that area, an intuitive method would be to
divide up the distance between a and b into a number of
equal segments, the length of each segment represented
by the symbol Δx.  For each small segment, we can
choose one value of the function f(x). Call that value h.
Then the area of the rectangle with base Δx and height h
gives the distance (time Δx multiplied by speed h)
traveled in that segment. Associated with each segment is
the average value of the function above it, f(x) = h. The
sum of all such rectangles gives an approximation of the
area between the axis and the curve, which is an
approximation of the total distance traveled. A smaller
value for Δx will give more rectangles and in most cases
a better approximation, but for an exact answer we need
to take a limit as Δx approaches zero.
The symbol of integration is  , an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_s"] elongated S (the S
stands for "sum"). The definite integral is written as: 
Integration can be thought of as measuring the
area under a curve, defined by f(x), between
two points (here a and b).
and is read "the integral from a to b of f-of-x with respect to x." The Leibniz notation dx is intended to
suggest dividing the area under the curve into an infinite number of rectangles, so that their width Δx
becomes the infinitesimally small dx.[44]: 44  In a formulation of the calculus based on limits, the notation
is to be understood as an operator that takes a function as an input and gives a number, the area, as an
output. The terminating differential, dx, is not a number, and is not being multiplied by f(x), although,
serving as a reminder of the Δx limit definition, it can be treated as such in symbolic manipulations of the
integral. Formally, the differential indicates the variable over which the function is integrated and serves as
a closing bracket for the integration operator.
The indefinite integral, or antiderivative, is written:
Functions differing by only a constant have the same derivative, and it can be shown that the antiderivative
of a given function is actually a family of functions differing only by a constant.[45]: 326  Since the
derivative of the function y = x2 + C, where C is any constant, is y′ = 2x, the antiderivative of the latter
is given by:
 The unspecified constant C present in the indefinite integral or antiderivative is known as the constant of
integration.

Fundamental theorem
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus"] fundamental theorem of calculus states that differentiation and integration are inverse
operations.[45]: 290  More precisely, it relates the values of antiderivatives to definite integrals. Because it is
usually easier to compute an antiderivative than to apply the definition of a definite integral, the
fundamental theorem of calculus provides a practical way of computing definite integrals. It can also be
interpreted as a precise statement of the fact that differentiation is the inverse of integration.
The fundamental theorem of calculus states: If a function f is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"] continuous on the interval [a, b] and if F is a
function whose derivative is f on the interval (a, b), then
Furthermore, for every x in the interval (a, b),
This realization, made by both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton"] Newton and Leibniz, was key to the proliferation of analytic results after
their work became known. (The extent to which Newton and Leibniz were influenced by immediate
predecessors, and particularly what Leibniz may have learned from the work of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Barrow"] Isaac Barrow, is difficult to
determine thanks to the priority dispute between them.[46]) The fundamental theorem provides an algebraic
method of computing many definite integrals—without performing limit processes—by finding formulae
for antiderivatives. It is also a prototype solution of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation"] differential equation. Differential equations relate an
unknown function to its derivatives, and are ubiquitous in the sciences.
Applications
Calculus is used in every branch of the physical sciences,[47]: 1 
 actuarial science, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science"] computer science, statistics, engineering,
economics, business, medicine, demography, and in other fields
wherever a problem can be [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model"] mathematically modeled and an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_(mathematics)"] optimal
solution is desired. It allows one to go from (non-constant) rates of
change to the total change or vice versa, and many times in
studying a problem we know one and are trying to find the
other.[48] Calculus can be used in conjunction with other
 mathematical disciplines. For example, it can be used with linear
algebra to find the "best fit" linear approximation for a set of points
in a domain. Or, it can be used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory"] probability theory to determine
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation_value"] expectation value of a continuous random variable given a
 probability density function.[49]: 37  In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_geometry"] analytic geometry, the study 
 The logarithmic spiral of the Nautilus
shell is a classical image used to
depict the growth and change related
to calculus.
of graphs of functions, calculus is used to find high points and low
points (maxima and minima),  slope, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concave_function"] concavity and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection_points"] inflection points. Calculus is also used to find
approximate solutions to equations; in practice it is the standard way to solve differential equations and do
root finding in most applications. Examples are methods such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method"] Newton's method, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_iteration"] fixed point iteration,
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_approximation"] linear approximation. For instance, spacecraft use a variation of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method"] Euler method to approximate
curved courses within zero gravity environments.
Page 12
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics"] Physics makes particular use of calculus; all concepts in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics"] classical mechanics and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism"] electromagnetism are
related through calculus. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass"] mass of an object of known density, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia"] moment of inertia of objects, and the
 potential energies due to gravitational and electromagnetic forces can all be found by the use of calculus.
An example of the use of calculus in mechanics is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion"] Newton's second law of motion, which states that the
derivative of an object's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum"] momentum with respect to time equals the net [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"] force upon it. Alternatively,
Newton's second law can be expressed by saying that the net force is equal to the object's mass times its
acceleration, which is the time derivative of velocity and thus the second time derivative of spatial position.
Starting from knowing how an object is accelerating, we use calculus to derive its path.[50]
Maxwell's theory of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism"] electromagnetism and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein"] Einstein's theory of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity"] general relativity are also expressed in the
language of differential calculus.[51][52]: 52–55  Chemistry also uses calculus in determining reaction
rates[53]: 599  and in studying radioactive decay.[53]: 814  In biology, population dynamics starts with
reproduction and death rates to model population changes.[54][55]: 631 
 Green's theorem, which gives the relationship between a line integral around a simple closed curve C and a
double integral over the plane region D bounded by C, is applied in an instrument known as a planimeter,
which is used to calculate the area of a flat surface on a drawing.[56] For example, it can be used to
calculate the amount of area taken up by an irregularly shaped flower bed or swimming pool when
designing the layout of a piece of property.
In the realm of medicine, calculus can be used to find the optimal branching angle of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_vessel"] blood vessel so as to
maximize flow.[57] Calculus can be applied to understand how quickly a drug is eliminated from a body or
how quickly a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer"] cancerous tumour grows.[58]
In economics, calculus allows for the determination of maximal profit by providing a way to easily
calculate both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost"] marginal cost and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_revenue"] marginal revenue.[59]: 387 
Varieties
Over the years, many reformulations of calculus have been investigated for different purposes.
Non-standard calculus
Imprecise calculations with infinitesimals were widely replaced with the rigorous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/(%CE%B5,_%CE%B4)-definition_of_limit"] (ε, δ)-definition of limit
starting in the 1870s. Meanwhile, calculations with infinitesimals persisted and often led to correct results.
This led [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Robinson"] Abraham Robinson to investigate if it were possible to develop a number system with infinitesimal
 quantities over which the theorems of calculus were still valid. In 1960, building upon the work of Edwin
Hewitt and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_%C5%81o%C5%9B"] Jerzy Łoś, he succeeded in developing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_analysis"] non-standard analysis. The theory of non-standard
analysis is rich enough to be applied in many branches of mathematics. As such, books and articles
dedicated solely to the traditional theorems of calculus often go by the title [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-standard_calculus"] non-standard calculus.
Smooth infinitesimal analysis
This is another reformulation of the calculus in terms of infinitesimals. Based on the ideas of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._Lawvere"] F. W. Lawvere
and employing the methods of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory"] category theory, it views all functions as being [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function"] continuous and incapable of
 being expressed in terms of discrete entities. One aspect of this formulation is that the law of excluded
middle does not hold in this formulation.[34]
Constructive analysis
Page 13
 Constructive mathematics is a branch of mathematics that insists that proofs of the existence of a number,
function, or other mathematical object should give a construction of the object. As such constructive
mathematics also rejects the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle"] law of excluded middle. Reformulations of calculus in a constructive
framework are generally part of the subject of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_analysis"] constructive analysis.[34]

"The great mathematicians of the seventeenth century were optimistic and anxious for quick
results; consequently they left the foundations of analytical geometry and the infinitesimal
calculus insecure. Leibniz believed in actual infinitesimals, but although this belief suited his
metaphysics it had no sound basis in mathematics. Weierstrass, soon after the middle of the
nineteenth century, showed how to establish the calculus without infinitesimals, and thus at
last made it logically secure. Next came Georg Cantor, who developed the theory of
continuity and infinite number. "Continuity" had been, until he defined it, a vague word,
convenient for philosophers like Hegel, who wished to introduce metaphysical muddles into
mathematics. Cantor gave a precise significance to the word, and showed that continuity, as
he defined it, was the concept needed by mathematicians and physicists. By this means a
great deal of mysticism, such as that of Bergson, was rendered antiquated."
