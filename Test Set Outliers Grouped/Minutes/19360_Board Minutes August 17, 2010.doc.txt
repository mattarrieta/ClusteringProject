Financial Review.
Don Kuykendall reported that in studying the future valuation of the company there are things that can be done now to help the accrual numbers. The board needs to be aware of the need to show a steady increase in revenue while reinvesting profits back into the company.
Robert Merry reviewed the budget and reported that the critical question was aligning the budget with our business plan. 
Don Kuykendall reported we continue to be under budget for July in institutional sales and over budget in Executive Briefings and consumer sales. He reported that we paid down $130,000 of the line of credit and will have the remainder paid down by September 1.
Robert Merry reviewed the re-forecasted budget with the Board.  He stated we need to keep expenses where they are to the end of the year. The plan for the 2011 budget will be developed over the next several months and issues such as raises and hires need to be examined in the context of next year.
