Chromium
Chromium is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element"] chemical element with the
 symbol Cr and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number"] atomic number 24. It is the first
element in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_6_element"] group 6. It is a steely-grey, lustrous,
hard, and brittle [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_metal"] transition metal.[4] 
Chromium, 24
Cr
Chromium metal is valued for its high [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion"] corrosion
resistance and hardness. A major development in
steel production was the discovery that steel
could be made highly resistant to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion"] corrosion and
discoloration by adding metallic chromium to
 form stainless steel. Stainless steel and chrome
plating ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroplating"] electroplating with chromium) together
comprise 85% of the commercial use. Chromium
is also highly valued as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal"] metal that is able to be
highly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polishing"] polished while resisting tarnishing.
Polished chromium reflects almost 70% of the
 visible spectrum, and almost 90% of infrared
light.[5] The name of the element is derived from
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek"] Greek word χρῶμα, chrōma,  meaning
color,[6] because many chromium compounds are
intensely colored.
Industrial production of chromium proceeds from
 chromite ore (mostly FeCr2O4)  to produce
ferrochromium, an iron-chromium alloy, by
 means of aluminothermic or silicothermic
reactions. Ferrochromium is then used to produce
alloys such as stainless steel. Pure chromium
metal is produced by a different process: [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roasting_(metallurgy)"] roasting
and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaching_(metallurgy)"] leaching of chromite to separate it from iron,
followed by reduction with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon"] carbon and then
aluminium.
In the United States, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivalent"] trivalent chromium (Cr(III))
 ion is considered an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_nutrient"] essential nutrient in humans
for insulin, sugar, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid"] lipid metabolism.[7]
 However, in 2014, the European Food Safety
Authority, acting for the European Union,
concluded that there was insufficient evidence for
chromium to be recognized as essential.[8]
While chromium metal and Cr(III) ions are
considered non-toxic, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexavalent_chromium"] hexavalent chromium,
Cr(VI), is toxic and carcinogenic. According to

compensate for that released by lessening inter- 52Cr 83.789%  stable
electronic repulsion. However, in the 3d transition
metals, the energy gap between the 3d and the  53Cr 9.501%  stable
next-higher 4s subshell is very small, and because
the 3d subshell is more compact than the 4s 
54Cr 2.365%  stable
subshell, inter-electron repulsion is smaller
between 4s electrons than between 3d electrons. This lowers the energetic cost of promotion and increases
the energy released by it, so that the promotion becomes energetically feasible and one or even two
electrons are always promoted to the 4s subshell. (Similar promotions happen for every transition metal
atom but one, palladium.)[12]
Chromium is the first element in the 3d series where the 3d electrons start to sink into the nucleus; they thus
 contribute less to metallic bonding, and hence the melting and boiling points and the enthalpy of
atomisation of chromium are lower than those of the preceding element vanadium. Chromium(VI) is a
strong [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidising_agent"] oxidising agent in contrast to the molybdenum(VI) and tungsten(VI) oxides.[13]
Bulk
 Chromium is extremely hard, and is the third hardest element behind carbon (diamond) and boron. Its Mohs
hardness is 8.5, which means that it can scratch samples of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz"] quartz and topaz, but can be scratched by
corundum. Chromium is highly resistant to tarnishing, which makes it useful as a metal that preserves its
outermost layer from corroding, unlike other metals such as copper, magnesium, and aluminium.
Chromium has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_point"] melting point of 1907 °C (3465 °F), which is relatively low compared to the majority of
transition metals. However, it still has the second highest melting point out of all the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_4"] Period 4 elements,
being topped by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanadium"] vanadium by 3 °C (5 °F) at 1910 °C (3470 °F). The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_point"] boiling point of 2671 °C (4840 °F),
however, is comparatively lower, having the third lowest boiling point out of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_4"] Period 4 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_metal"] transition metals
alone behind [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese"] manganese and zinc.[note 1] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_and_conductivity"] electrical resistivity of chromium at 20 °C is 125 nanoohm-
meters.
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corundum"]
Page 4
Chromium has a high [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection"] specular reflection in comparison to other
transition metals. In infrared, at 425 μm, chromium has a maximum
reflectance of about 72%, reducing to a minimum of 62% at 750
μm before rising again to 90% at 4000 μm.[5] When chromium is
used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel"] stainless steel alloys and polished, the specular reflection
decreases with the inclusion of additional metals, yet is still high in
comparison with other alloys. Between 40% and 60% of the visible
spectrum is reflected from polished stainless steel.[5] The
explanation on why chromium displays such a high turnout of
reflected [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon"] photon waves in general, especially the 90% in infrared,
can be attributed to chromium's magnetic properties.[14] Chromium
has unique magnetic properties - chromium is the only elemental
Sample of pure chromium metal solid that shows [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiferromagnetic"] antiferromagnetic ordering at room temperature
and below. Above 38 °C, its magnetic ordering becomes
paramagnetic.[2] The antiferromagnetic properties, which cause the
chromium atoms to temporarily [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionization"] ionize and bond with themselves, are present because the body-centric
cubic's magnetic properties are disproportionate to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_structure"] lattice periodicity. This is due to the magnetic
moments at the cube's corners and the unequal, but antiparallel, cube centers.[14] From here, the frequency-
dependent [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_permittivity"] relative permittivity of chromium, deriving from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations"] Maxwell's equations and chromium's
antiferromagnetism, leaves chromium with a high infrared and visible light reflectance.[15]
Passivation
Chromium metal left standing in air is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivation_(chemistry)"] passivated - it forms a thin, protective, surface layer of oxide. This
layer has a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinel"] spinel structure a few atomic layers thick; it is very dense and inhibits the diffusion of oxygen
into the underlying metal. In contrast, iron forms a more porous oxide through which oxygen can migrate,
 causing continued rusting.[16] Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric
acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reducing_agent"] reducing agent
that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves
in weak acids.[17]
Chromium, unlike iron and nickel, does not suffer from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_embrittlement"] hydrogen embrittlement. However, it does suffer
from nitrogen embrittlement, reacting with nitrogen from air and forming brittle nitrides at the high
temperatures necessary to work the metal parts.[18]
Isotopes
Naturally occurring chromium is composed of three stable isotopes; 52Cr, 53Cr and 54Cr, with 52Cr being
the most abundant (83.789% [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_abundance"] natural abundance). 19 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope"] radioisotopes have been characterized, with the most
stable being 50Cr with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life"] half-life of (more than) 1.8 ×1017 years, and 51Cr with a half-life of 27.7 days. All
of the remaining [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive"] radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 24 hours and the majority less than 1
minute. Chromium also has two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastable"] metastable [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_isomer"] nuclear isomers.[19]
53Cr is the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiogenic"] radiogenic decay product of 53[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese"] Mn (half-life = 3.74 million years).[20] Chromium isotopes are
 typically collocated (and compounded) with manganese isotopes. This circumstance is useful in isotope
geology. Manganese-chromium isotope ratios reinforce the evidence from 26[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"] Al and 107[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palladium"] Pd concerning the
early history of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System"] Solar System. Variations in 53Cr/52Cr and Mn/Cr ratios from several meteorites indicate
an initial 53Mn/55Mn ratio that suggests Mn-Cr isotopic composition must result from in-situ decay of
53Mn in differentiated planetary bodies. Hence 53Cr provides additional evidence for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleosynthesis"] nucleosynthetic
processes immediately before coalescence of the Solar System.[21]
Page 5
The isotopes of chromium range in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_mass"] atomic mass from 43 u (43Cr) to 67 u (67Cr). The primary [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decay_mode"] decay mode
 before the most abundant stable isotope, 52Cr, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta
decay.[19] 53Cr has been posited as a proxy for atmospheric oxygen concentration.[22]
Chemistry and compounds
Chromium is a member of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_6_element"] group 6, of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_metal"] transition metals. The +3
and +6 states occur most commonly within chromium compounds,
followed by +2; charges of +1, +4 and +5 for chromium are rare,
but do nevertheless occasionally exist.[25][26]

Chromium(III) can be obtained by dissolving elemental chromium in acids
like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrochloric_acid"] hydrochloric acid or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid"] sulfuric acid, but it can also be formed through the

in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_alum"] chrome alum and alum.
Chromium(III) tends to form [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedral_molecular_geometry"] octahedral complexes. Commercially available [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium(III)_chloride"] chromium(III) chloride hydrate
is the dark green complex [CrCl2(H2O)4]Cl. Closely related compounds are the pale green

Other oxidation states
Compounds of chromium(V) are rather rare; the oxidation state +5 is only realized in few compounds but
are intermediates in many reactions involving oxidations by chromate. The only binary compound is the
volatile [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium(V)_fluoride"] chromium(V) fluoride (CrF5). This red solid has a melting point of 30 °C and a boiling point of
117 °C. It can be prepared by treating chromium metal with fluorine at 400 °C and 200 bar pressure. The
peroxochromate(V) is another example of the +5 oxidation state. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_tetraperoxochromate(V)"] Potassium peroxochromate (K3[Cr(O2)4])
is made by reacting potassium chromate with hydrogen peroxide at low temperatures. This red brown
compound is stable at room temperature but decomposes spontaneously at 150–170 °C.[34]
Compounds of chromium(IV) are slightly more common than those of chromium(V). The tetrahalides,
 CrF4, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium(IV)_chloride"] CrCl4, and CrBr4, can be produced by treating the trihalides (CrX3
) with the corresponding halogen
at elevated temperatures. Such compounds are susceptible to disproportionation reactions and are not stable
in water. Organic compounds containing Cr(IV) state such as chromium tetra t-butoxide are also
known.[35]
Most chromium(I) compounds are obtained solely by oxidation of electron-rich, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octahedral_molecular_geometry"] octahedral chromium(0)
 complexes. Other chromium(I) complexes contain cyclopentadienyl ligands. As verified by X-ray
diffraction, a Cr-Cr [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintuple_bond"] quintuple bond (length 183.51(4)  pm) has also been described.[36] Extremely bulky
monodentate ligands stabilize this compound by shielding the quintuple bond from further reactions.
Occurrence 
Chromium is the 21st[37] most
 abundant element in Earth's crust
with an average concentration of
100 ppm. Chromium compounds
are found in the environment from
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion"] erosion of chromium-containing
 Crocoite (PbCrO4)  rocks, and can be redistributed by
volcanic eruptions. Typical
background concentrations of
 Chromite ore 
chromium in environmental media
are: atmosphere <10 ng/m3;  soil
<500  mg/kg;  vegetation
<0.5 mg/kg; freshwater <10 μg/L;
seawater <1  μg/L; sediment
<80 mg/kg.[38] Chromium is mined
as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromite"] chromite (FeCr2O4) ore.[39] 
Chromium compound determined
experimentally to contain a Cr-Cr
quintuple bond
About two-fifths of the chromite ores and concentrates in the world are
produced in South Africa, about a third in Kazakhstan,[40] while India,
Russia, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey"] Turkey are also substantial producers. Untapped chromite deposits are plentiful, but
geographically concentrated in Kazakhstan and southern Africa.[41] Although rare, deposits of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_metal"] native
chromium exist.[42][43] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udachnaya_Pipe"] Udachnaya Pipe in Russia produces samples of the native metal. This mine is a
 kimberlite pipe, rich in diamonds, and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"] reducing environment helped produce both elemental chromium
and diamonds.[44]
Page 8
The relation between Cr(III) and Cr(VI) strongly depends on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH"] pH and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidative"] oxidative properties of the location. In
most cases, Cr(III) is the dominating species,[23] but in some areas, the ground water can contain up to
39 µg/L of total chromium, of which 30 µg/L is Cr(VI).[45]

Chromium minerals as pigments came to the attention of the west in the eighteenth century. On 26 July
 1761, Johann Gottlob Lehmann found an orange-red mineral in the Beryozovskoye mines in the Ural
Mountains which he named Siberian red lead.[46][47] Though misidentified as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead"] lead compound with
 selenium and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"] iron components, the mineral was in fact [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocoite"] crocoite with a formula of PbCrO4.[48] In 1770,
 Peter Simon Pallas visited the same site as Lehmann and found a red lead mineral that was discovered to
possess useful properties as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigment"] pigment in paints. After Pallas, the use of Siberian red lead as a paint pigment
began to develop rapidly throughout the region.[49] Crocoite would be the principal source of chromium in
pigments until the discovery of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromite"] chromite many years later.[50]
In 1794, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Nicolas_Vauquelin"] Louis Nicolas Vauquelin received samples of crocoite ore. He
 produced chromium trioxide (CrO3) by mixing crocoite with hydrochloric
acid.[48] In 1797, Vauquelin discovered that he could isolate metallic
chromium by heating the oxide in a charcoal oven, for which he is credited
as the one who truly discovered the element.[51][52] Vauquelin was also
able to detect traces of chromium in precious gemstones, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby"] ruby and
emerald.[48][53]
The red color of rubies is
due to trace amounts of
chromium within the
corundum. 
During the nineteenth century, chromium was primarily used not only as a
component of paints, but in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanning_(leather)"] tanning salts as well. For quite some time, the
crocoite found in Russia was the main source for such tanning materials. In
1827, a larger chromite deposit was discovered near Baltimore, United
States, which quickly met the demand for tanning salts much more
adequately than the crocoite that had been used previously.[54] This made
the United States the largest producer of chromium products until the year 1848, when larger deposits of
chromite were uncovered near the city of Bursa, Turkey.[39] With the development of metallurgy and
chemical industries in the Western world, the need for chromium increased.[55]
Chromium is also famous for its reflective, metallic luster when polished. It is used as a protective and
decorative coating on car parts, plumbing fixtures, furniture parts and many other items, usually applied by
electroplating. Chromium was used for electroplating as early as 1848, but this use only became
widespread with the development of an improved process in 1924.[56]
Production
Approximately 28.8 million metric tons (Mt) of marketable chromite ore was produced in 2013, and
converted into 7.5 Mt of ferrochromium.[41] According to John F. Papp, writing for the USGS,
"Ferrochromium is the leading end use of chromite ore, [and] stainless steel is the leading end use of
ferrochromium."[41]
The largest producers of chromium ore in 2013 have been South Africa (48%), Kazakhstan (13%), Turkey
(11%), and India (10%), with several other countries producing the rest of about 18% of the world

production.[41]
The two main products of chromium ore refining are
 ferrochromium and metallic chromium. For those products the ore
smelter process differs considerably. For the production of
ferrochromium, the chromite ore (FeCr2O4) is reduced in large
scale in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc_furnace"] electric arc furnace or in smaller smelters with either
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"] aluminium or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon"] silicon in an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminothermic_reaction"] aluminothermic reaction.[57]
For the production of pure chromium, the iron must
be separated from the chromium in a two step
roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is
heated with a mixture of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_carbonate"] calcium carbonate and
 sodium carbonate in the presence of air. The
chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while
the iron forms the stable Fe2O3.  The subsequent
leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the
 chromates and leaves the insoluble iron oxide. The
chromate is converted by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid"] sulfuric acid into the
dichromate.[57] 
Chromium ore output in 2002[58]
4 FeCr2O4 + 8 Na2CO3 + 7 O2 → 8 Na2CrO4 + 2 Fe2O3 + 8 CO2
2 Na2CrO4 + H2SO4 → Na2Cr2O7 + Na2SO4 + H2O
The dichromate is converted to the chromium(III) oxide by reduction with carbon and then reduced in an
aluminothermic reaction to chromium.[57]
Na2Cr2O7 + 2 C → Cr2O3 + Na2CO3 + CO
Cr2O3 + 2 Al → Al2O3 + 2 Cr
Applications
The creation of metal alloys account for 85% of the available chromium's usage. The remainder of
chromium is used in the chemical, refractory, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundry"] foundry industries.[59]
Page 10
Metallurgy
The strengthening effect of forming stable metal carbides at grain
boundaries, and the strong increase in corrosion resistance made
 chromium an important alloying material for steel. High-speed tool
steels contain between 3 and 5% chromium. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel"] Stainless steel, the
primary corrosion-resistant metal alloy, is formed when chromium
is introduced to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"] iron in concentrations above 11%.[60] For stainless
steel's formation, ferrochromium is added to the molten iron. Also,
nickel-based alloys have increased strength due to the formation of
discrete, stable, metal, carbide particles at the grain boundaries. For
example, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inconel"] Inconel 718 contains 18.6% chromium. Because of the
excellent high-temperature properties of these nickel superalloys,
they are used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine"] jet engines and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_turbine"] gas turbines in lieu of common
structural materials.[61] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASTM"] ASTM B163 relies on Chromium for
condenser and heat-exchanger tubes, while [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castings"] castings with high
strength at elevated temperatures that contain Chromium are
standardised with ASTM A567.[62] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Iron_and_Steel_Institute"] AISI type 332 is used where
high temperature would normally cause carburization, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxidation"] oxidation or

maintaining its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austenitic"] austenitic structure even after long time exposures to high temperatures".[64] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichrome"] Nichrome is
used as resistance wire for heating elements in things like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toasters"] toasters and space heaters. These uses make
chromium a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_material"] strategic material. Consequently, during World War II, U.S. road engineers were instructed to
avoid chromium in yellow road paint, as it "may become a critical material during the emergency."[65] The
United States likewise considered chromium "essential for the German war industry" and made intense
diplomatic efforts to keep it out of the hands of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany"] Nazi Germany.[66]
Decorative chrome plating on a
motorcycle
is used.[56] 
The high hardness and corrosion resistance of unalloyed chromium
makes it a reliable metal for surface coating; it is still the most
popular metal for sheet coating, with its above-average durability,
compared to other coating metals.[67] A layer of chromium is
deposited on pretreated metallic surfaces by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroplating"] electroplating
techniques. There are two deposition methods: thin, and thick. Thin
deposition involves a layer of chromium below 1 µm thickness
deposited by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_plating"] chrome plating, and is used for decorative surfaces.
Thicker chromium layers are deposited if wear-resistant surfaces
are needed. Both methods use acidic chromate or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichromate"] dichromate
solutions. To prevent the energy-consuming change in oxidation
state, the use of chromium(III) sulfate is under development; for
most applications of chromium, the previously established process
In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromate_conversion_coating"] chromate conversion coating process, the strong oxidative properties of chromates are used to deposit
a protective oxide layer on metals like aluminium, zinc, and cadmium. This [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passivation_(chemistry)"] passivation and the self-healing
properties of the chromate stored in the chromate conversion coating, which is able to migrate to local
defects, are the benefits of this coating method.[68] Because of environmental and health regulations on
chromates, alternative coating methods are under development.[69]
Chromic acid [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anodizing"] anodizing (or Type I anodizing) of aluminium is another electrochemical process that does
not lead to the deposition of chromium, but uses [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromic_acid"] chromic acid as an electrolyte in the solution. During
anodization, an oxide layer is formed on the aluminium. The use of chromic acid, instead of the normally
Page 11
used sulfuric acid, leads to a slight difference of these oxide layers.[70]The high toxicity of Cr(VI)
compounds, used in the established chromium electroplating process, and the strengthening of safety and
environmental regulations demand a search for substitutes for chromium, or at least a change to less toxic
chromium(III) compounds.[56]
Pigment
The mineral [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocoite"] crocoite (which is also [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_chromate"] lead chromate PbCrO4) was used as a yellow pigment shortly after its
 discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome
yellow was, together with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium_yellow"] cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not
photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and
was used for school buses in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"] United States and for the Postal Service (for example, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Post"] Deutsche Post)
in Europe. The use of chrome yellow has since declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was
replaced by organic pigments or other alternatives that are free from lead and chromium. Other pigments
that are based around chromium are, for example, the deep shade of red pigment [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_red"] chrome red, which is
simply lead chromate with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead(II)_hydroxide"] lead(II) hydroxide (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment,
which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate.
A wash primer was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pre-treating aluminium aircraft bodies
 with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl
butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that
an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15 µm was applied, which
turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism.
Chrome green is a mixture of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_blue"] Prussian blue and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_yellow"] chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is
 chromium(III) oxide.[71]
Chromium oxides are also used as a green pigment in the field of glassmaking and also as a glaze for
ceramics.[72] Green chromium oxide is extremely [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightfastness"] lightfast and as such is used in cladding coatings. It is
also the main ingredient in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared"] infrared reflecting paints, used by the armed forces to paint vehicles and to give
them the same infrared reflectance as green leaves.[73]
Other uses
Chromium(III) ions present in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corundum"] corundum crystals (aluminium
oxide) cause them to be colored red; when corundum appears as
such, it is known as a ruby. If the corundum is lacking in
chromium(III) ions, it is known as a sapphire.[note 3] A red-colored
artificial ruby may also be achieved by doping chromium(III) into
artificial corundum crystals, thus making chromium a requirement
for making synthetic rubies.[note 4][74] Such a synthetic ruby crystal
was the basis for the first laser, produced in 1960, which relied on
 stimulated emission of light from the chromium atoms in such a
crystal. Ruby has a laser transition at 694.3 nanometers, in a deep
red color.[75] 
Red crystal of a ruby laser
Because of their toxicity, chromium(VI) salts are used for the preservation of wood. For example,
 chromated copper arsenate (CCA) is used in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timber_treatment"] timber treatment to protect wood from decay fungi, wood-
attacking insects, including termites, and marine borers.[76] The formulations contain chromium based on
the oxide CrO3 between 35.3% and 65.5%. In the United States, 65,300 metric tons of CCA solution were
used in 1996.[76]
Page 12
Chromium(III) salts, especially [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_alum"] chrome alum and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium(III)_sulfate"] chromium(III) sulfate, are used in the tanning of leather.
The chromium(III) stabilizes the leather by cross linking the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collagen"] collagen fibers.[77] Chromium tanned leather
can contain between 4 and 5% of chromium, which is tightly bound to the proteins.[39] Although the form
of chromium used for tanning is not the toxic hexavalent variety, there remains interest in management of
chromium in the tanning industry. Recovery and reuse, direct/indirect recycling,[78] and "chrome-less" or
"chrome-free" tanning are practiced to better manage chromium usage.[79]
The high heat resistivity and high melting point makes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromite"] chromite and chromium(III) oxide a material for
high temperature refractory applications, like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_furnace"] blast furnaces, cement kilns, molds for the firing of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick"] bricks and
as foundry sands for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting_(metalworking)"] casting of metals. In these applications, the refractory materials are made from
mixtures of chromite and magnesite. The use is declining because of the environmental regulations due to
the possibility of the formation of chromium(VI).[57] [80]
 Several chromium compounds are used as catalysts for processing hydrocarbons. For example, the Phillips
catalyst, prepared from chromium oxides, is used for the production of about half the world's
 polyethylene.[81] Fe-Cr mixed oxides are employed as high-temperature catalysts for the water gas shift
reaction.[82][83] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_chromite"] Copper chromite is a useful [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogenation"] hydrogenation catalyst.[84]
Uses of compounds
 Chromium(IV) oxide (CrO2) is a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism"] magnetic compound. Its ideal shape anisotropy, which
imparts high [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercivity"] coercivity and remnant magnetization, made it a compound superior to γ-
Fe2O3. Chromium(IV) oxide is used to manufacture [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_tape"] magnetic tape used in high-performance
audio tape and standard [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_audio_cassette"] audio cassettes.[85]
 Chromium(III) oxide (Cr2O3) is a metal polish known as green rouge.[86][87]
 Chromic acid is a powerful oxidizing agent and is a useful compound for cleaning laboratory
 glassware of any trace of organic compounds.[88] It is prepared by dissolving potassium
 dichromate in concentrated sulfuric acid, which is then used to wash the apparatus. Sodium
dichromate is sometimes used because of its higher solubility (50 g/L versus 200 g/L
respectively). The use of dichromate cleaning solutions is now phased out due to the high
toxicity and environmental concerns. Modern cleaning solutions are highly effective and
chromium free.[89]
 Potassium dichromate is a chemical reagent, used as a titrating agent.[90]
 Chromates are added to drilling muds to prevent corrosion of steel under wet conditions.[91]
 Chrome alum is [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium(III)_potassium_sulfate"] Chromium(III) potassium sulfate and is used as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordant"] mordant (i.e., a fixing
agent) for dyes in fabric and in tanning.[92]
Biological role
The biologically beneficial effects of chromium(III) are debated.[93][94] Chromium is accepted by the U.S.
National Institutes of Health as a trace element for its roles in the action of insulin, a hormone that mediates
the metabolism and storage of carbohydrate, fat, and protein.[7] The mechanism of its actions in the body,
however, have not been defined, leaving in question the essentiality of chromium.[95][96]
In contrast, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexavalent_chromium"] hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI) or Cr6+) is highly toxic and mutagenic.[97] Ingestion of
chromium(VI) in water has been linked to stomach tumors, and it may also cause allergic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_dermatitis"] contact dermatitis
(ACD).[98]
Page 13
"[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_deficiency"] Chromium deficiency", involving a lack of Cr(III) in the body, or perhaps some complex of it, such as
 glucose tolerance factor, is controversial.[7] Some studies suggest that the biologically active form of
 chromium (III) is transported in the body via an oligopeptide called low-molecular-weight chromium-
binding substance (LMWCr), which might play a role in the insulin signaling pathway.[99]
The chromium content of common foods is generally low (1-13 micrograms per serving).[7][100] The
chromium content of food varies widely, due to differences in soil mineral content, growing season, plant
cultivar, and contamination during processing.[100] Chromium (and nickel) leach into food cooked in
stainless steel, with the effect being largest when the cookware is new. Acidic foods that are cooked for
many hours also exacerbate this effect.[101][102]
Dietary recommendations
There is disagreement on chromium's status as an essential nutrient. Governmental departments from
Australia, New Zealand, India, Japan, and the United States consider chromium essential[103][104][105][106]
while the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Food_Safety_Authority"] European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) of the European Union does not.[107]
The U.S. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Medicine"] National Academy of Medicine (NAM) updated the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Reference_Intake#Parameters"] Estimated Average Requirements (EARs)
and the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Reference_Intake#Parameters"] Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for chromium in 2001. For chromium, there was
 insufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so its needs are described as estimates for Adequate
Intakes (AIs). The current AIs of chromium for women ages 14 through 50 is 25 μg/day, and the AIs for
women ages 50 and above is 20 μg/day. The AIs for women who are pregnant are 30 μg/day, and for
women who are lactating, the set AIs are 45 μg/day. The AIs for men ages 14 through 50 are 35 μg/day,
and the AIs for men ages 50 and above are 30 μg/day. For children ages 1 through 13, the AIs increase
with age from 0.2 μg/day up to 25 μg/day. As for safety, the NAM sets [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Reference_Intake#Parameters"] Tolerable Upper Intake Levels
(ULs) for vitamins and minerals when the evidence is sufficient. In the case of chromium, there is not yet
enough information, hence no UL has been established. Collectively, the EARs, RDAs, AIs, and ULs are
the parameters for the nutrition recommendation system known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Reference_Intake"] Dietary Reference Intake (DRI).[106]
Australia and New Zealand consider chromium to be an essential nutrient, with an AI of 35 μg/day for
men, 25 μg/day for women, 30 μg/day for women who are pregnant, and 45 μg/day for women who are
lactating. A UL has not been set due to the lack of sufficient data.[103] India considers chromium to be an
essential nutrient, with an adult recommended intake of 33 μg/day.[104] Japan also considers chromium to
be an essential nutrient, with an AI of 10 μg/day for adults, including women who are pregnant or lactating.
A UL has not been set.[105] The EFSA of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"] European Union however, does not consider chromium to be
an essential nutrient; chromium is the only mineral for which the United States and the European Union
disagree.[107][108]
Labeling
For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount of the substance in a serving is
expressed as a percent of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_Daily_Intake"] Daily Value (%DV). For chromium labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily
Value was 120 μg. As of May 27, 2016, the percentage of daily value was revised to 35 μg to bring the
chromium intake into a consensus with the official [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietary_Reference_Intake"] Recommended Dietary Allowance.[109][110] A table of
the old and new adult daily values is provided at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_Daily_Intake"] Reference Daily Intake.
Food sources
Page 14
Food composition databases such as those maintained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture do not
contain information on the chromium content of foods.[111] A wide variety of animal and vegetable foods
contain chromium.[106] Content per serving is influenced by the chromium content of the soil in which the
plants are grown, by foodstuffs fed to animals, and by processing methods, as chromium is leached into
foods if processed or cooked in stainless steel equipment.[112] One diet analysis study conducted in Mexico
reported an average daily chromium intake of 30 micrograms.[113] An estimated 31% of adults in the
United States consume multi-vitamin/mineral dietary supplements,[114] which often contain 25 to 60
micrograms of chromium.
Supplementation
Chromium is an ingredient in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_parenteral_nutrition"] total parenteral nutrition (TPN), because deficiency can occur after months of
 intravenous feeding with chromium-free TPN.[115] It is also added to nutritional products for preterm
infants.[116] Although the mechanism of action in biological roles for chromium is unclear, in the United
States chromium-containing products are sold as non-prescription dietary supplements in amounts ranging
from 50 to 1,000 μg. Lower amounts of chromium are also often incorporated into multi-vitamin/mineral
supplements consumed by an estimated 31% of adults in the United States.[114] Chemical compounds used
in dietary supplements include chromium chloride, chromium citrate, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium(III)_picolinate"] chromium(III) picolinate,
 chromium(III) polynicotinate, and other chemical compositions.[7] The benefit of supplements has not been
proven.[7][117]
Approved and disapproved health claims
In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had approved a Qualified Health Claim for chromium
picolinate with a requirement for very specific label wording: "One small study suggests that chromium
picolinate may reduce the risk of insulin resistance, and therefore possibly may reduce the risk of type 2
diabetes. FDA concludes, however, that the existence of such a relationship between chromium picolinate
and either insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes is highly uncertain." At the same time, in answer to other
parts of the petition, the FDA rejected claims for chromium picolinate and cardiovascular disease,
retinopathy or kidney disease caused by abnormally high blood sugar levels.[118] In 2010, chromium(III)
picolinate was approved by Health Canada to be used in dietary supplements. Approved labeling
statements include: a factor in the maintenance of good health, provides support for healthy glucose
metabolism, helps the body to metabolize carbohydrates and helps the body to metabolize fats.[119] The
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Food_Safety_Authority"] European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved claims in 2010 that chromium contributed to normal
macronutrient metabolism and maintenance of normal blood glucose concentration, but rejected claims for
maintenance or achievement of a normal body weight, or reduction of tiredness or fatigue.[120]
Given the evidence for chromium deficiency causing problems with glucose management in the context of
intravenous nutrition products formulated without chromium,[115] research interest turned to whether
chromium supplementation would benefit people who have type 2 diabetes but are not chromium deficient.
Looking at the results from four meta-analyses, one reported a statistically significant decrease in fasting
 plasma glucose levels (FPG) and a non-significant trend in lower [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin"] hemoglobin A1C.[121] A second reported
the same,[122] a third reported significant decreases for both measures,[123] while a fourth reported no
benefit for either.[124] A review published in 2016 listed 53 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_clinical_trial"] randomized clinical trials that were included in
one or more of six [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis"] meta-analyses. It concluded that whereas there may be modest decreases in FPG and/or
HbA1C that achieve statistical significance in some of these meta-analyses, few of the trials achieved
decreases large enough to be expected to be relevant to clinical outcome.[125]
Page 15
Two [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systematic_review"] systematic reviews looked at chromium supplements as a mean of managing body weight in
overweight and obese people. One, limited to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_picolinate"] chromium picolinate, a popular supplement ingredient,
reported a statistically significant −1.1 kg (2.4 lb) weight loss in trials longer than 12 weeks.[126] The other
included all chromium compounds and reported a statistically significant −0.50 kg (1.1 lb) weight
change.[127] Change in percent body fat did not reach statistical significance. Authors of both reviews
 considered the clinical relevance of this modest weight loss as uncertain/unreliable.[126][127] The European
Food Safety Authority reviewed the literature and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support
a claim.[120]
Chromium is promoted as a sports performance dietary supplement, based on the theory that it potentiates
insulin activity, with anticipated results of increased muscle mass, and faster recovery of glycogen storage
during post-exercise recovery.[117][128][129] A review of clinical trials reported that chromium
supplementation did not improve exercise performance or increase muscle strength.[130] The International
Olympic Committee reviewed dietary supplements for high-performance athletes in 2018 and concluded
there was no need to increase chromium intake for athletes, nor support for claims of losing body fat.[131]
Fresh-water fish
Chromium is naturally present in the environment in trace amounts, but industrial use in rubber and
stainless steel manufacturing, chrome plating, dyes for textiles, tanneries and other uses contaminates
aquatic systems. In Bangladesh, rivers in or downstream from industrialized areas exhibit heavy metal
contamination. Irrigation water standards for chromium are 0.1 mg/L, but some rivers are more than five
times that amount. The standard for fish for human consumption is less than 1 mg/kg, but many tested
samples were more than five times that amount.[132] Chromium, especially hexavalent chromium, is highly
toxic to fish because it is easily absorbed across the gills, readily enters blood circulation, crosses cell
membranes and bioconcentrates up the food chain. In contrast, the toxicity of trivalent chromium is very
low, attributed to poor membrane permeability and little biomagnification.[133]
Acute and chronic exposure to chromium(VI) affects fish behavior, physiology, reproduction and survival.
Hyperactivity and erratic swimming have been reported in contaminated environments. Egg hatching and
fingerling survival are affected. In adult fish there are reports of histopathological damage to liver, kidney,
muscle, intestines, and gills. Mechanisms include mutagenic gene damage and disruptions of enzyme
functions.[133]
There is evidence that fish may not require chromium, but benefit from a measured amount in diet. In one
study, juvenile fish gained weight on a zero chromium diet, but the addition of 500 μg of chromium in the
form of chromium chloride or other supplement types, per kilogram of food (dry weight), increased weight
gain. At 2,000 μg/kg the weight gain was no better than with the zero chromium diet, and there were
increased DNA strand breaks.[134]
Precautions
Water-insoluble chromium(III) compounds and chromium metal are not considered a health hazard, while
the toxicity and carcinogenic properties of chromium(VI) have been known for a long time.[135] Because
of the specific [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_protein"] transport mechanisms, only limited amounts of chromium(III) enter the cells. Acute oral
toxicity ranges between 50 and 150 mg/kg.[136] A 2008 review suggested that moderate uptake of
 chromium(III) through dietary supplements poses no genetic-toxic risk.[137] In the US, the Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has designated an air [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissible_exposure_limit"] permissible exposure limit (PEL) in the
Page 16
 workplace as a time-weighted average (TWA) of 1 mg/m3. The National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health (NIOSH) has set a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recommended_exposure_limit"] recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.5 mg/m3, time-weighted average.
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDLH"] IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 250 mg/m3.[138]
Chromium(VI) toxicity
The acute [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth"] oral [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity"] toxicity for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexavalent_chromium"] chromium(VI) ranges between 1.5 and 3.3 mg/kg.[136] In the body,
chromium(VI) is reduced by several mechanisms to chromium(III) already in the blood before it enters the
cells. The chromium(III) is excreted from the body, whereas the chromate ion is transferred into the cell by
a transport mechanism, by which also [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate"] sulfate and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate"] phosphate ions enter the cell. The acute toxicity of
chromium(VI) is due to its strong [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox"] oxidant properties. After it reaches the blood stream, it damages the
kidneys, the liver and blood cells through oxidation reactions. Hemolysis, renal, and liver failure result.
Aggressive dialysis can be therapeutic.[139]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenity"] carcinogenity of chromate dust has been known for a long time, and in 1890 the first publication
described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a chromate dye company.[140][141] Three mechanisms
have been proposed to describe the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotoxicity"] genotoxicity of chromium(VI). The first mechanism includes highly
reactive [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl_radical"] hydroxyl radicals and other reactive radicals which are by products of the reduction of
chromium(VI) to chromium(III). The second process includes the direct binding of chromium(V), produced
by reduction in the cell, and chromium(IV) compounds to the DNA. The last mechanism attributed the
genotoxicity to the binding to the DNA of the end product of the chromium(III) reduction.[142][143]
Chromium salts (chromates) are also the cause of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_reaction"] allergic reactions in some people. Chromates are often
used to manufacture, amongst other things, leather products, paints, cement, mortar and anti-corrosives.
Contact with products containing chromates can lead to allergic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_dermatitis"] contact dermatitis and irritant dermatitis,
resulting in ulceration of the skin, sometimes referred to as "chrome ulcers". This condition is often found
in workers that have been exposed to strong chromate solutions in electroplating, tanning and chrome-
producing manufacturers.[144][145]
Environmental issues
Because chromium compounds were used in dyes, paints, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather"] leather [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanning_(leather)"] tanning compounds, these
compounds are often found in soil and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundwater"] groundwater at active and abandoned industrial sites, needing
 environmental cleanup and remediation. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(paint)"] Primer paint containing hexavalent chromium is still widely used
for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace"] aerospace and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"] automobile refinishing applications.[146]
In 2010, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Working_Group"] Environmental Working Group studied the drinking water in 35 American cities in the first
nationwide study. The study found measurable hexavalent chromium in the tap water of 31 of the cities
sampled, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman,_Oklahoma"] Norman, Oklahoma, at the top of list; 25 cities had levels that exceeded California's
proposed limit.[147]
The more toxic hexavalent chromium form can be reduced to the less soluble trivalent oxidation state in
soils by organic matter, ferrous iron, sulfides, and other reducing agents, with the rates of such reduction
being faster under more acidic conditions than under more alkaline ones. In contrast, trivalent chromium
can be oxidized to hexavalent chromium in soils by manganese oxides, such as Mn(III) and Mn(IV)
compounds. Since the solubility and toxicity of chromium (VI) are greater that those of chromium (III), the
oxidation-reduction conversions between the two oxidation states have implications for movement and
bioavailability of chromium in soils, groundwater, and plants.[148]
Notes
Page 17
1. The melting/boiling point of transition metals are usually higher compared to the alkali
metals, alkaline earth metals, and nonmetals, which is why the range of elements compared
to chromium differed between comparisons
2. Most common oxidation states of chromium are in bold. The right column lists a
representative compound for each oxidation state.
3. Any color of corundum (disregarding red) is known as a sapphire. If the corundum is red,
then it is a ruby. Sapphires are not required to be blue corundum crystals, as sapphires can
be other colors such as yellow and purple
4. When Cr3+replaces Al3+in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corundum"] corundum (aluminium oxide, Al2O3), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_sapphire"] pink sapphire or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby"] ruby is
formed, depending on the amount of chromium.
