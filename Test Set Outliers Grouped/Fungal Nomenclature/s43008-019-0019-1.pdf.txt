Abstract
A revised version of Chapter F of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants is presented,
incorporating amendments approved by the Fungal Nomenclature Session of the 11th International Mycological
Congress held in San Juan, Puerto Rico in July 2018. The process leading to the amendments is outlined. Key
changes in the San Juan Chapter F are (1) removal of option to use a colon to indicate the sanctioned status of a
name, (2) introduction of correctability for incorrectly cited identifiers of names and typifications, and (3)
introduction of option to use name identifiers in place of author citations. Examples have been added to aid the
interpretation of new Articles and Recommendations, and Examples have also been added to the existing Art. F.3.7
concerning the protection extended to new combinations based on sanctioned names or basionyms of sanctioned
names (which has been re-worded), and to Art. F.3.9 concerning typification of names accepted in the sanctioning
works.

INTRODUCTION
Chapter F of the International Code of Nomenclature for
algae, fungi, and plants (Code) is the section of the Code
that brings together provisions that deal solely with
names of organisms treated as fungi. Chapter F was an
innovation in the Shenzhen Code (Turland et al. 2018).
Furthermore, Division III of the Shenzhen Code, the Pro-
visions for Governance, included new procedures for
amending Chapter F,  so that proposals relating to the
content of Chapter F are decided on by the Fungal No-
menclature Session (FNS) of an International Myco-
logical Congress (IMC) (Hawksworth et al. 2017).  The
FNS of the 11th IMC was held on 19 July 2018. The

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article 
revised version of Chapter F resulting from proposals ac-
cepted at this FNS is presented here, referred to as the
San Juan Chapter F. The online version of the Shenzhen
Code will be amended so that its Chapter F becomes the
San Juan Chapter F,  with new and edited material
marked as such.
The San Juan Chapter F supersedes Chapter F of the
Shenzhen Code. The rules of the San Juan Chapter F be-
came effective immediately upon acceptance of the reso-
lution at the closing plenary session of the 11th
International Mycological Congress (IMC11) on 21 July
2018, that the decisions and appointments of its Fungal
Nomenclature Session be approved. Previous Codes have
been translated into various languages. If the San Juan
Chapter F is translated into other languages, the English
version will be definitive in questions about the meaning
of provisions in any translations.

AMENDING CHAPTER F
Seven formal proposals to amend Chapter F of the
Shenzhen Code were published in IMA Fungus,  the
journal of the International Mycological Association,
on 1 April 2018 (Hawksworth 2018).  A synopsis of
these proposals, with comments by the Secretary
(T.W. May) and Deputy Secretary (S.A. Redhead) of
the Fungal Nomenclature Bureau, was published in
IMA Fungus on 23 May 2018 (May and Redhead
2018).  This synopsis served as the basis for the pre-
liminary guiding vote that was held online, opening
on 22 May 2018 and closing on 17 June 2018. As
specified by Division III of the Shenzhen Code,  par-
ticipation in the guiding vote was extended to (1) au-
thors of proposals, (2) members of the Nomenclature
Committee for Fungi (NCF),  (3) members of the
International Mycological Association (IMA),  and of
its Member Mycological Organizations (MMOs),  and
(4) members of four additional organizations that
were nominated by the Fungal Nomenclature Bureau.
Results of the guiding vote were published in IMA
Fungus on 13 July 2018 (May and Miller 2018).  That
report also included two further proposals, and in
total 11 “proposals from the floor”  were received
prior to the commencement of the Fungal Nomencla-
ture Session.
The Fungal Nomenclature Session met on 19 July
2018 in Room 201, Puerto Rico Convention Center,
San Juan, Puerto Rico, during the main part of
IMC11 held at the same Congress Centre from 16 to
21 July 2018. Any person registered for the day of
the Congress on which the FNS was held was enti-
tled to attend and vote; 149 such persons attended
the FNS. Officers of the FNS, appointed in conform-
ity with Division III of the Shenzhen Code,  were
Amy Rossman (Corvallis, USA, Chair),  Tom W. May
(Melbourne, Australia, Secretary),  Scott A. Redhead
(Ottawa, Canada, Deputy Secretary),  Lorenzo Lom-
bard (Utrecht, The Netherlands, Recorder),  and five
Deputy Chairs, David L. Hawksworth (London, UK,
Deputy Chair Emeritus),  Meredith Blackwell
(Columbia, USA),  Pedro Crous (Utrecht, The
Netherlands),  Karen Hughes (Knoxville, USA),  and
Yu Li (Changchun, China; in absentia).  In addition,
Nicholas J. Turland (Berlin, Germany),  Rapporteur-
général for the 2023 International Botanical Con-
gress (IBC),  attended as a non-voting advisor to the
FNS, on the invitation of the International Myco-
logical Association.
Procedures in the lead up to and during the FNS
closely followed those of the Nomenclature Section of
an IBC, except that during the FNS there were no
“institutional” votes. Discussions of the FNS were held
in English, and were recorded. The full proceedings 
of the San Juan FNS will form a separate publication,
planned for early 2020, following the tradition of pro-
viding transcriptions of the proceedings of Nomencla-
ture Sections of IBCs (e.g. Flann et al. 2014 for the
Melbourne IBC).
An Editorial Committee for each Code is elected
by the Nomenclature Section of the corresponding
IBC. For Chapter F,  it was desirable to mirror this
process, and a proposal to amend Division III to
make specific reference to an Editorial Committee
for Fungi was put forward at the San Juan FNS.
However, at the FNS this proposal was considered to
be outside of the mandate of the FNS (see below).
Instead, an ad hoc Editorial Committee for Fungi, as
allowed under Div. III Prov. 5.2(e) and 8.1, was
proposed and approved by the FNS at the beginning
of the session prior to voting on individual pro-
posals. Composition of the Editorial Committee for
Fungi is Tom W. May (Melbourne, Australia,
Secretary Fungal Nomenclature Bureau),  Scott A.
Redhead (Ottawa, Canada, Deputy Secretary Fungal
Nomenclature Bureau),  Konstanze Bensch (The
Netherlands/Germany),  David Hawksworth (London,
UK, Deputy Chair Emeritus Fungal Nomenclature
Bureau),  James C. Lendemer (New York, USA),  Lor-
enzo Lombard (Utrecht, The Netherlands),  and
Nicholas J. Turland (Berlin, Germany, Rapporteur-
général of the 2023 IBC, Chair Editorial Committee).
Membership is as approved by the FNS with
addition of Lombard and Lendemer, who were
elected by the Editorial Committee for Fungi after
the Congress.
According to the Preface of the Shenzhen Code,  the
Editorial Committee has a mandate to “deal with mat-
ters specifically referred to it, to incorporate into the
new Code the changes agreed by the Section, to clar-
ify any ambiguous wording so long as the meaning is
not changed, to ensure consistency and optimal place-
ment of provisions while retaining the present num-
bering insofar as possible, and to add (or remove)
Examples to best illustrate the provisions”.  The Edi-
torial Committee for Fungi proceeded as if with the
same mandate; knowing that their work would be
reviewed in due course by the Editorial Committee
for the Shenzhen Code.
The “Report of Congress action on nomenclature
proposals relating to fungi”,  detailing the committees
and officers appointed by the IMC and the results of
the proposals was published in IMA Fungus on 9 No-
vember 2018 (May et al. 2018).  This publication
reported that, of the seven published proposals to
amend Chapter F of the Shenzhen Code, two were ac-
cepted and two were referred to the Editorial Com-
mittee for Fungi; an additional proposal was accepted
Page 3
May et al. IMA Fungus (2019) 10:21  Page 3 of 14
from among 11 new proposals made from the floor
of the FNS. Five proposals (three introduced from the
floor) were referred to two Special-purpose Commit-
tees, established by the FNS.
At the San Juan FNS, seven of the proposals from the
floor related to governance, as covered in Division III. It
was realized that these proposals were likely to be outside
of the current mandate extended to the IMC, which is lim-
ited to “proposals relating to the content of Chapter F”
(Div. III Prov. 8.1). Consequently, four of the seven pro-
posals were withdrawn by their proposers and three were
rejected. One such proposal concerned establishment of an
“Editorial Committee for Fungi” (see above), the others re-
lated to the guiding vote. As discussed in the report on
Congress actions (May et al. 2018) an opinion will be
sought from the General Committee as to whether or not
proposals to modify Division III (in relation to procedures
restricted to mycological matters) can be dealt with at an
IMC, or must be considered at an IBC.
A first draft of the San Juan Chapter F,  incorporat-
ing the changes approved at IMC11, was prepared by
TWM in October 2018, and distributed to the Editor-
ial Committee for Fungi. After a number of rounds of
discussion and editing, a draft was provided in late
August 2019 to the Nomenclature Committee for
Fungi and, as required by Div. III Prov. 8.10, to the
Editorial Committee. Several weeks of intense discus-
sion ensued, and a final draft was submitted to IMA
Fungus on 9 September 2019.
We note that it was impractical for the Editorial
Committee for Fungi to meet by teleconference due
to the geographic spread of members (and consequent
spread of time zones),  and therefore all discussions
were by e-mail. We recommend a face-to-face meet-
ing of the Editorial Committee for Fungi as soon as
possible after the FNS of the Amsterdam IMC in
2022, and consider that such a meeting would be
beneficial in the expeditious preparation of a devel-
oped draft of the “Amsterdam Chapter F”.
The Editorial Committee for a given Code has in the
past ceased active work once the relevant Code has been
published. We note that members of the Editorial Com-
mittee were available and engaged positively at the final
stage of revisions of the San Juan Chapter F. They will
also need to be involved in four years hence, after the
Amsterdam IMC, should any changes to the San Juan
Chapter F be accepted at that Congress.
AMENDMENTS TO CHAPTER F
Four new Articles and one new Recommendation have
been inserted in the San Juan Chapter F, and a number of
other Articles and Recommendations and a Note have
been partially or substantially re-worded (Tables 1 and 2).
New Examples have been provided in the new Articles 
Table 1 List of changes to Articles, Notes, Recommendations
and footnotes in the San Juan Chapter F
Numbering adopted in the San Juan Chapter F is used. No existing
provisions needed re-numbering but some Examples were re-numbered.
Art. F.3.2  Example added (Ex. 1)
Art. F.3.4  Example added (Ex. 5)
Art. F.3.7  reworded for clarity; Examples added (Ex. 8 and 9)
Art. F.3.9 and Note 2 Examples added (Ex. 10 and 11)
Rec. F.3A.1  significant revision; removal of colon as indicator
of sanctioning (and Examples throughout Chapter
F edited to conform)
Rec. F.3A.1 footnote reworded to reflect revised version of Rec. F.3A.1
Art. F.5.1  Examples added (Ex. 2 and 3)
Art. F.5.2  new footnote; concerning identifiers for
orthographical corrections
Art. F.5.4  minor revision; added “for the type designation”
after identifier
Art. F.5 Note 4  minor revision; added “or guarantee” after
constitute, to mirror Art. F.5 Note 1
Art. F.5.6–5.8  new; concerning incorrectly cited identifiers;
Examples added (Ex. 4 and 5)
Rec. F.5A.1  some minor revisions and new clause (c); authors
should lodge electronic versions (such as PDFs)
of publications with repositories
Rec. F.5A.2  minor revisions; deleted “accession”
Art. F.10  new; use of identifier in place of author citation
Rec. F.10A  as above; Example added (Ex. 1)
and Recommendation, and Examples have also been
added to a number of existing provisions. In comparison
to Chapter F of the Shenzhen Code, existing provisions
did not require re-numbering but some existing Exam-
ples required re-numbering due to insertion of new
Examples. None of the new provisions is date-limited,
and therefore they are retroactive (Principle VI).  The
new material is summarized at the head of the San Juan
Chapter F (Appendix).  We present here some further
comments on the new material, and on two Articles
that were the subject of an unsuccessful proposal, ar-
ranged in the order in which they appear in the San
Juan Chapter F.
Art. F.3.7 is conceded to be one of the more diffi-
cult Articles of the Code to comprehend on first ac-
quaintance. There was no formal proposal to alter
the Article, but the Editorial Committee for Fungi,
in consultation with the Editorial Committee, revised
the Article to make it more comprehensible. It
would seem simplest to state that, within a given
rank below genus, when sanctioned names are com-
bined in new combinations protected status is
retained over earlier non-sanctioned names (as long as
the sanctioned names are available for the required com-
binations).  However, “sanctioned names”  are strictly

Table 2 Summary of changes incorporated in the San Juan
Chapter F
In each case, the full wording of each Article, Note, Recommendation,
Example and footnote should be consulted.
• Art. F.3.7 reworded for clarity and Examples added concerning
protection extended to names in sanctioning works used in new
combinations.
• Selection of the type of a name adopted in one of the sanctioning works
remains a choice among elements associated with the protologue and/or
the sanctioning treatment [Art. F.3.9]. Wording unchanged, but Examples
added.
• Sanctioning should be indicated only by “nom. sanct.”
(the “:” option was removed) [Rec. F.3A].
• Repositories assign new identifiers for names with corrected orthography
[footnote to Art. F.5.2].
• Errors in citation of identifiers are correctible, as long as the identifier was
issued prior to publication of the nomenclatural novelty or typification
[Art. F.5.6, Art. F.5.8].
• Subsequent validations of names associated with incorrectly cited
identifiers are later isonyms and may be disregarded (as long as the
identifier was issued for the isonym prior to its publication).
Consequence of Art F.5.6.
• A new identifier must be obtained when validating a designation
(an “invalid name”), even when that designation is associated with
an existing identifier [Art. F.5.7].
• Authors are encouraged to provide electronic versions (such as PDFs)
of publications containing nomenclatural novelties and typifications to
the repository that issued the relevant identifiers [Rec. F.5A.1].
• Identifier issued for a name may be used in place of an author citation —
but authors of a new name, a new combination, a name at a new
rank, or a replacement name must still be cited in a protologue
[Art. F.10, Rec. F.10A].
names as they appear when accepted in the sanctioning
works. Therefore, when a sanctioned name is a combin-
ation, its basionym is not itself sanctioned (despite use in
the past of the term “sanctioned basionym”). Hence the
device in Art. F.3.7 of referring to a name that “has the
same type and final epithet as a sanctioned name” to cover
names that are combinations based on sanctioned names
or based on the basionyms of sanctioned names. Two Ex-
amples have been included to demonstrate the application
of the Article.
There were two proposals to amend Art. F.3.9,
concerning typification in relation to sanctioned
names (Proposals F-001 and F-002,  proposed by Luis
A. Parra and Juan C. Zamora in Hawksworth 2018).
The intent of the proposals, in particular the first,
was to allow neotypifications of sanctioned names to
stand when such neotypifications were carried out
despite elements from the context of the sanctioning
work being available. The proposals were rejected,
and Art. F.3 Note 2 referred to the Editorial Commit-
tee. After considering the Note, the Editorial Commit-
tee for Fungi decided that the current wording
carried the intended meaning. Thus, where neotypifi-
cations have been undertaken in relation to types of 
names adopted in the sanctioning works, but there
are elements associated with the context of the sanc-
tioning work (such as cited illustrations or references
to works that contain illustrations) that are suitable
for selection as lectotypes, these neotypifications must
be set aside (Art. 9.19),  and lectotypification should
be carried out. In this circumstance, if it is desired to
maintain a particular usage, former neotypes may be
selected as epitypes if they are not in conflict with
the lectotype.
When it is appropriate to indicate the sanctioned
status of a name, this is now recommended to be
only by use of “nom. sanct.” (Rec. F.3A).  The term
“nom. sanct.” should be attached only to names ac-
cepted by sanctioning authors as they appear in the
sanctioning works (i.e. “sanctioned names”).  The term
“nom. sanct.” should be attached neither to new com-
binations based on sanctioned names (where they are
basionyms),  nor to basionyms of sanctioned names
(when the sanctioned name is a combination),  nor to
any combinations based on the basionym of a name
that is sanctioned that are not themselves sanctioned.
Use of “nom. sanct.” therefore parallels use of “nom.
cons.”, which is attached to a name as conserved. Exam-
ples in the San Juan Chapter F that involve sanctioned
names have all been edited in conformity with the new
Rec. F.3A. The online version of the Shenzhen Code will
reflect these changes in the San Juan Chapter F, but out-
side of Chapter F it retains the former indication of sanc-
tioning (the abbreviation of the sanctioning author
following a colon). After the next IBC, entries in the re-
mainder of the Code that involve sanctioned names will
be updated in conformity with the San Juan Chapter F, re-
placing the colon method by “nom. sanct.”.
Several new provisions were added in Art. F.5 con-
cerning aspects of the registration of names and nomen-
clatural acts. Art. F.5.6 and Art. F.5.8 are new and
provide for correctability of incorrectly cited identifiers.
The new Art. F.5.7 specifies that where a designation
(an “invalid name”) has been introduced in association
with an identifier, a new identifier must be obtained
when validly publishing the former designation. Because
Art. F.5.6 is not date-limited, it is retroactive (Principle
VI),  and consequently subsequent validations of names
associated with incorrectly cited identifiers are later iso-
nyms and may be disregarded (Art. 6 Note 2).
In relation to the practice of repositories recognized
under Art. F.5.3, it is useful to distinguish the “issu-
ing” of an identifier, in cases where a recognized re-
pository issues an identifier to an author so that the
author can comply with Art. F.5.1 or Art. F.5.4, from
the “assigning” of an identifier, in situations where a
repository assigns an identifier for internal database
purposes, such as when adding to the repository a
Page 5
May et al. IMA Fungus (2019) 10:21  Page 5 of 14
designation published without an identifier, or when
making an orthographical correction. In the latter
situation, the corrected version of the name is
assigned a new identifier. The assigning of a new
identifier to orthographical variants is not a Code-
governed event, and is therefore not referred to under
any Articles. However, a footnote has been added to
Art. F.5.2 noting the practice of assigning new identi-
fiers to names with corrected orthography.
Rec. F.5A.1 was enlarged, with a new clause (c),  to
encourage authors of names to provide electronic ver-
sions of their publications to recognized repositories.
The new Art. F.10 permits use of the identifier is-
sued for a name by a recognized repository to be
used in place of an author citation, subsequent to
the valid publication of the name. The form speci-
fied is to cite the numerical portion of the identifier
preceded by the # symbol, all enclosed in square
brackets (Rec. F.10A).  Nevertheless, when introdu-
cing names of new taxa, new combinations, names at
new ranks, and replacement names conventional au-
thor citation is still to be used. It is important to
note that while identifiers are issued by recognized
repositories (currently three),  data held by repositor-
ies, including identifiers, are shared on a regular
basis. Therefore, when using an identifier in place of
an author citation, the link may be to any repository
that contains the required information.
GLOSSARY AND APPENDICES
There are no modifications to the Glossary. The
seven Appendices of the Code are currently available
by querying an online database hosted by the Depart-
ment of Botany at the Smithsonian National Museum
of Natural History in Washington, DC, USA ([URL: "https://naturalhistory2.si.edu/botany/codes-proposals/"] https://
 naturalhistory2.si.edu/botany/codes-proposals/),  main-
tained by John H. Wiersema. The Appendices consist
of lists of conserved and rejected names, suppressed
works and binding decisions that are added to as a
result of: (1) consideration of proposals to conserve
and reject, requests for binding decisions and requests
to suppress works by Specialist Committees such as
the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi (Div. III Prov.
7) in concert with the General Committee, and (2)
consideration of lists of names for protection or rejec-
tion submitted under Art. F.2 or Art. F.7 (although
no lists have yet been submitted under the latter
provision).  Final approval of material in the Appendi-
ces rests with an IBC, even when involving names of
fungi or works exclusively devoted to fungi.
FORMATTING AND STANDARDS
The San Juan Chapter F follows the formatting and
standards used in the other sections of the Code. 
Further information on formatting and the citation
of names of authors and bibliographic citations can
be found in the Preface to the Shenzhen Code (pp.
xxiii-xxiv).  Recommendations and Notes are set in
smaller type than the Articles, and the Examples and
footnotes in smaller type than the Recommendations
and Notes. These type sizes reflect the distinction
between mandatory rules (Articles),  complementary
information or advice (Notes and Recommendations),
and explanatory material (Examples and footnotes).
Notes have binding effect but, unlike Articles, do
not introduce any new provision or concept. Exam-

size, by being indented.
THE FUNGAL NOMENCLATURE SESSION AT IMC12
AND NEW PROPOSALS TO AMEND CHAPTER F
The International Code of Nomenclature for algae,
fungi, and plants is amended by authority of the
International Botanical Congress (IBC) except that
its Chapter F is amended by authority of the Inter-
national Mycological Congress (IMC);  the San Juan
Chapter F is the first such amendment. Provisions
for the amendment of the Code can be found in its
Division III, including specific provisions relating to
amendments of Chapter F,  which are dealt with at
the Fungal Nomenclature Session of an IMC. The
next International Mycological Congress, the twelfth
(IMC12),  will take place in Amsterdam, The
Netherlands from 25 to 29 July 2022, with its Fungal
Nomenclature Session held during this time. Pro-
posals to amend the San Juan Chapter F may be
published in IMA Fungus starting in 2020 and end-
ing in early 2022. In early 2020, a notice will appear
in IMA Fungus including an announcement that the
journal will accept proposals and instructions on
procedure and format. Proposals that are not
submitted within the specified time frame cannot be
included in the guiding vote. It is highly desirable
that proposals are published well in advance of the
IMC, to allow sufficient time for debate among the
mycological community, and preparation of refine-
ments or counter-proposals. Two Special-purpose
Committees were established by the San Juan IMC:
on “DNA sequences as Types for Fungi” and on
“Names of Fungi with the Same Epithet”.  These
Committees will report to the Amsterdam IMC and
are still in the process of being set up. Committee
members will be appointed by the Nomenclature
Committee for Fungi in consultation with the Gen-
eral Committee, and the membership will be an-
nounced in a report of the NCF, appearing in IMA
Fungus.

Appendix 
CHAPTER F
NAMES OF ORGANISMS TREATED AS FUNGI
(SAN JUAN VERSION)
This Chapter brings together the provisions of this Code that deal solely with names of organisms treated as fungi.
Content in this Chapter may be modified by action of the Fungal Nomenclature Session of an International Myco-
logical Congress (IMC) (see Div. III Prov. 8). The current version of this Chapter, the San Juan Chapter F, embodies
the decisions accepted by the 11th IMC in San Juan (Puerto Rico) on 21 July 2018.
Always consult the online version of this Code ([URL: "http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php"] http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php) in case of changes
resulting from subsequent IMCs. The next IMC will be held in Amsterdam (The Netherlands) in 2022.
The following changes were introduced in the San Juan Chapter F:
Art. F.3.7. The Article was reworded to improve clarity, and two Examples were added.
Art. F.3.9. Two Examples were added.
Rec. F.3A. The option of using a colon to indicate sanctioning was removed. If it is desired to indicate sanctioning, it
is recommended that this be done by using the abbreviation “nom. sanct.”.
Art. F.5. Several new provisions were added concerning aspects of the registration of names and nomenclatural
acts. Art. F.5.6 allows correctability of incorrectly cited identifiers; Art. F.5.7 specifies that, in order for a des-
ignation that may be associated with an existing identifier to become a validly published name, a new identi-
fier must be obtained; and Art. F.5.8 extends correctability to identifiers issued for type designations. Rec.
F.5A.1 was enlarged to encourage authors of names to provide electronic versions of their publications to
recognized repositories. A footnote was added to Art. F.5.2 noting the practice of assigning new identifiers
to names with corrected orthography. Note that because Art. F.5.6 is not date-limited, it is retroactive
(Principle VI), and consequently validations of names associated with incorrectly cited identifiers are later
isonyms and may be disregarded (Art. 6 Note 2).
Art. F.10. A new Article was added concerning the use of identifiers in place of author citations.
Mycologists should note that the content of this Code outside of Chapter F pertains to all organisms covered by this
Code, including fungi, unless expressly limited. This content includes rules about effective publication, valid publica-
tion, typification, legitimacy, and priority of names; citation and orthography; and names of hybrids.
Some provisions in the Preamble, Principles, Articles, and Recommendations elsewhere in this Code, such as those
listed below, while not restricted to fungi, are of particular relevance to mycologists. The full wording of these and
all other relevant provisions of this Code should be consulted in all cases.
Pre. 8. The provisions of this Code apply to all organisms traditionally treated as fungi, whether fossil or non-fossil,
including chytrids, oomycetes, and slime moulds (but excluding Microsporidia).
Principle I. This Code applies to names of taxonomic groups treated as fungi, whether or not these groups were
originally so treated.
Art. 4 Note 4. In classifying parasites, especially fungi, authors may distinguish within the species special forms
(formae speciales) characterized by their adaptation to different hosts, but the nomenclature of special forms
is not governed by the provisions of this Code.
Page 8
May et al. IMA Fungus (2019) 10:21  Page 8 of 14
Art. 8.4 (see also Art. 8 Ex. 12, Rec. 8B, Art. 40 Note 3, and Art. 40.8). Cultures of fungi are acceptable as types if
preserved in a metabolically inactive state, and on or after 1 January 2019 this must be stated in the protologue.
Art. 14.15 and Art. 14 Note 4(c)(2). Before 1 January 1954, decisions on conservation of names made by the Special
Committee for Fungi, became effective on 20 July 1950 at the VII International Botanical Congress in
Stockholm.
Art. 16.3. Automatically typified suprafamilial names of fungi end as follows: division or phylum in -mycota,
subdivision or subphylum in -mycotina, class in -mycetes, and subclass in -mycetidae. Automatically typified
names not in accordance with these terminations are to be corrected.
Rec. 38E.1. The hosts should be indicated in descriptions or diagnoses of new taxa of parasitic organisms,
especially fungi.
Art. 40.5. The type of a name of a new species or infraspecific taxon of non-fossil microfungi may be an effectively
published illustration if there are technical difficulties of specimen preservation or if it is impossible to preserve
a specimen that would show the features attributed to the taxon by the author of the name (but see
Art. 40 Ex. 6, which treats representations of DNA sequences as falling outside of the definition of illustrations
in Art. 6.1 footnote).
Art. 41.8(b) (see also Art. 41 Ex. 26).  Failure to cite the place of valid publication of a basionym or replaced
synonym, when explained by the backward shift of the starting date for some fungi, is a correctable error.
Art. 45.1 (see also Art. 45 Ex. 6 and 7 and Note 1). If a taxon originally assigned to a group not covered by this
Code is treated as belonging to the algae or fungi, any of its names need satisfy only the requirements of the rele-
vant other Code that the author was using for status equivalent to valid publication under this Code. Note espe-
cially that names of Microsporidia are not covered by this Code even when Microsporidia are considered as fungi.
SECTION 1
LIMITATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF PRIORITY
ARTICLE F.1
NOMENCLATURAL STARTING-POINT
F.1.1. Valid publication of names for non-fossil fungi (Pre. 8) is treated as beginning at 1 May 1753 (Linnaeus, Species
plantarum, ed. 1, treated as having been published on that date; see Art. 13.1). For nomenclatural purposes, names
given to lichens apply to their fungal component. Names of Microsporidia are governed by the International Code of
Zoological Nomenclature (see Pre. 8).
Note 1. For fossil fungi, see Art. 13.1(f). 
ARTICLE F.2
PROTECTED NAMES
F.2.1. In the interest of nomenclatural stability, for organisms treated as fungi, lists of names proposed for protection
may be submitted to the General Committee, which will refer them to the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi (see
Div. III Prov. 2.2, 7.9, and 7.10) for examination by subcommittees established by that Committee in consultation
with the General Committee and appropriate international bodies. Protected names on these lists, which become part
of the Appendices of the Code (see App. IIA, III, and IV) once reviewed and approved by the Nomenclature Commit-
tee for Fungi and the General Committee (see Art. 14.15 and Rec. 14A.1), are to be listed with their types and are
treated as conserved against any competing listed or unlisted synonyms or homonyms (including sanctioned names),
although conservation under Art. 14 overrides this protection. The lists of protected names remain open for revision
through the procedures described in this Article (see also Art. F.7.1).

ARTICLE F.3
SANCTIONED NAMES
F.3.1. Names in Uredinales, Ustilaginales, and Gasteromycetes (s. l.) adopted by Persoon (Synopsis methodica fun-
gorum, 1801) and names of other fungi (excluding slime moulds) adopted by Fries (Systema mycologicum, vol. 1–3.
1821–1832, with additional Index, 1832; and Elenchus fungorum, vol. 1–2. 1828), are sanctioned.
F.3.2. Names sanctioned are treated as if conserved against earlier homonyms and competing synonyms. Such
names, once sanctioned, remain sanctioned even if elsewhere in the sanctioning works the sanctioning author does
not recognize them. The spelling used when the name was sanctioned is treated as conserved, except for changes
mandated by Art. 60 and F.9.
Ex. 1. The name Strigula smaragdula Fr. (in Linnaea 5: 550. 1830) was accepted by Fries (Syst. Mycol.,  Index: 184. 1832) and there-
fore sanctioned. It is treated as if conserved against the competing earlier synonym Phyllochoris elegans Fée (Essai Crypt. Ecorc: xciv.
1825), which is the basionym of Strigula elegans (Fée) Müll. Arg. (in Linnaea 43: 41. 1880).
Ex. 2. Agaricus ericetorum Pers. (Observ. Mycol. 1: 50. 1796) was accepted by Fries (Syst. Mycol. 1: 165. 1821),  but later (Elench.
Fung. 1: 22. 1828) regarded by him as a synonym of A. umbelliferus L. (Sp. Pl.:  1175. 1753),  nom. sanct.,  and not included in his
Index (p. 18. 1832) as an accepted name. Nevertheless A. ericetorum Pers. is a sanctioned name.
Ex. 3. The spelling used when the name Merulius lacrimans (Wulfen) Schumach. was sanctioned (Fries, Syst. Mycol. 1: 328. 1821) is
to be maintained, even though the epithet was spelled ‘lacrymans’  by Schumacher (Enum. Pl. 2: 371. 1803) and the basionym was ori-
ginally published as Boletus ‘lacrymans’  Wulfen (in Jacquin, Misc. Austriac. 2: 111. 1781).
F.3.3. A sanctioned name is illegitimate if it is a later homonym of another sanctioned name (see also Art. 53).
F.3.4. An earlier homonym of a sanctioned name is not made illegitimate by that sanctioning but is unavailable for
use; if not otherwise illegitimate, it may serve as a basionym of another name or combination based on the same type
(see also Art. 55.3).
Ex. 4. Patellaria Hoffm. (Descr. Pl. Cl. Crypt. 1: 33, 54, 55. 1789) is an earlier homonym of the sanctioned generic name Patellaria
Fr. (Syst. Mycol. 2: 158. 1822).  Hoffmann’s name is legitimate but unavailable for use. Lecanidion Endl. (Fl. Poson.:  46. 1830),  based
on the same type as Patellaria Fr., nom. sanct., is illegitimate under Art. 52.1.
Ex. 5. Antennaria Gaertn. (Fruct. Sem. Pl. 2: 410. 1791), in order to become available for use, required conservation against the later homo-
nym Antennaria Link (in Neues J. Bot. 3(1,2): 16. 1809), nom. sanct. (Fries, Syst. Mycol. 1: xlvii. 1821).
Ex. 6. Agaricus cervinus Schaeff. (Fung. Bavar. Palat. Nasc. 4: 6. 1774) is an earlier homonym of the sanctioned name A. cervinus Hoffm. (Nomencl.
Fung. 1: t. 2, fig. 2. 1789), nom. sanct. (Fries, Syst. Mycol. 1: 82. 1821); Schaeffer’s name is unavailable for use, but it is legitimate and may serve as
basionym for combinations in other genera. In Pluteus Fr. the combination is cited as P. cervinus (Schaeff.) P. Kumm. and has priority over the het-
erotypic (taxonomic) synonym P. atricapillus (Batsch) Fayod, based on A. atricapillus Batsch (Elench. Fung.: 77. 1786).
F.3.5. When, for a taxon at a rank from family to genus, inclusive, two or more sanctioned names compete, Art. 11.3
governs the choice of the correct name (see also Art. F.3.7).
F.3.6. When, for a taxon at a rank lower than genus, two or more sanctioned names and/or two or more
names with the same final epithet and type as a sanctioned name compete, Art. 11.4 governs the choice of the
correct name.
Note 1. The date of sanctioning does not affect the date of valid publication, and therefore priority (Art. 11), of a sanctioned
name. In particular, when two or more homonyms are sanctioned only the earliest of them may be used because the later one(s)
are illegitimate under Art. F.3.3.
Page 10
May et al. IMA Fungus (2019) 10:21  Page 10 of 14
Ex. 7. Fries (Syst. Mycol. 1: 41. 1821) accepted and thus sanctioned Agaricus flavovirens Pers. (in Hoffmann, Abbild. Schwämme 3: t. 24.
1793) and treated A. equestris L. (Sp. Pl.: 1173. 1753) as a synonym. He later (Elench. Fung. 1: 6. 1828) accepted A. equestris, stating “Nomen
prius et aptius certe restituendum [The prior and more apt name is certainly to be restored]”. Both names are sanctioned, but, when they are
treated as synonyms, A. equestris L., nom. sanct. is to be used because it has priority.
F.3.7. A name that neither is sanctioned nor has the same type and final epithet as a sanctioned name at the same
rank may not be used for a taxon that includes the type of a sanctioned name at that rank unless the final epithet of
the sanctioned name is not available for the required combination (see Art. 11.4(c)).
Ex. 8. The name Agaricus involutus Batsch (Elench. Fung.: 39. 1786) was sanctioned by Fries (Syst. Mycol. 1: 271. 1821) and therefore, when
treated in Paxillus Fr. with the earlier but non-sanctioned name A. contiguus Bull. (Herb. Fr. 5: t. 240. 1785) as a synonym, the correct name
is P. involutus (Batsch) Fr.
Ex. 9. The name Polyporus brumalis (Pers.) Fr. (Observ. Mycol. 2: 255. 1818), nom. sanct. (Fries, Syst. Mycol. 1: 348. 1821), based on
Boletus brumalis Pers. (in Neues Mag. Bot. 1: 107. 1794),  was treated by Zmitrovich & Kovalenko (in Int. J. Med. Mushr. 18: 23–38,
suppl. 2: [2].  2015) as synonymous with B. hypocrateriformis Schrank (Baier. Fl. 2: 621. 1789) and placed in Lentinus Fr., nom. sanct.,
in which the correct name is L. brumalis (Pers.) Zmitr. (in Int. J. Med. Mushr. 12: 88. 2010).
F.3.8. Conservation (Art. 14), protection (Art. F.2), and explicit rejection (Art. 56 and F.7) override sanctioning.
F.3.9. The type of a name of a species or infraspecific taxon adopted in one of the works specified in Art. F.3.1, and
thereby sanctioned, may be selected from among the elements associated with the name in the protologue and/or
the sanctioning treatment.
Note 2. For names falling under Art. F.3.9, elements from the context of the protologue are original material and those from
the context of the sanctioning work are considered as equivalent to original material.
Ex. 10. When Stadler & al. (in IMA Fungus 5: 61. 2014) designated the lectotype of Clavaria hypoxylon L. (Sp. Pl.: 1182. 1753), sanctioned by
Fries (Syst. Mycol. 2: 327. 1823) as Sphaeria hypoxylon (L.) Pers. (Observ. Mycol. 1: 20. 1796), they selected a specimen in K distributed by
Fries (Scler. Suec. No. 181) and cited by him in the sanctioning treatment rather than any of the elements associated with the protologue.
Ex. 11. In the absence of any specimens or illustrations from the context of the protologue that are original material, Peterson (in Amer. J.
Bot. 63: 313. 1976) designated a specimen in L as the neotype of Clavaria formosa Pers. (Comm. Fung. Clav.: 41. 1797), nom. sanct. However,
when sanctioning C. formosa, Fries (Syst. Mycol. 1: 466. 1821) cited several illustrations, which are therefore considered as equivalent to ori-
ginal material. Peterson’s neotypification was not therefore designated in conformity with Art. 9.13 and is not to be followed (Art. 9.19). In-
stead, Franchi & Marchetti (in Riv. Micol. 59: 323. 2017) designated as the lectotype of C. formosa one of the illustrations (Persoon, Icon.
Desc. Fung. Min. Cognit. 1: t. III, fig. 6. 1798) that was cited by Fries (l.c., as “f. 5”).
F.3.10. When a sanctioning author accepted an earlier name but did not include, even implicitly, any element associated
with its protologue, or when the protologue did not include the subsequently designated type of the sanctioned name,
the sanctioning author is considered to have created a later homonym, treated as if conserved (see also Art. 48).
Note 3. For typification of sanctioned generic names, see Art. 10.2. Note that automatic typification under Art. 7.5 does not
apply to sanctioned names. For legitimacy of sanctioned names (or names based on them), see also Art. 6.4, 52.1, 53.1, and 55.3.
Recommendation F.3A
F.3A.1. When it is considered useful to indicate the nomenclatural status of a sanctioned name (Art. F.3.1), the abbreviation
“nom. sanct.” (nomen sanctionatum) should be added in a formal citation; the place of sanctioning should also be added in full
nomenclatural citations.1
1In Chapter F, sanctioning is indicated by “nom. sanct.”, but elsewhere in this Code sanctioning remains indicated by “: Fr.” or “: Pers.”,
following the wording of Rec. F.3A.1 of the Shenzhen Code of 2018 before it was superseded by the current wording accepted by the San
Juan International Mycological Congress on 21 July 2018.

Ex. 1. Boletus piperatus Bull. (Herb. France: t. 451, fig. 2. 1790) was adopted in Fries (Syst. Mycol. 1: 388. 1821) and was thereby sanctioned.
Depending on the level of nomenclatural information being presented, it should be cited as B. piperatus Bull., nom. sanct.; or B. piperatus
Bull. 1790, nom. sanct.; or B. piperatus Bull., Herb. France: t. 451, fig. 2. 1790, nom. sanct.; or B. piperatus Bull., Herb. France: t. 451, fig. 2.
1790, nom. sanct. (Fries, Syst. Mycol. 1: 388. 1821).
Ex. 2. Agaricus compactus [unranked] sarcocephalus (Fr.) Fr. was sanctioned when adopted by Fries (Syst. Mycol. 1: 290. 1821). That status
should be indicated by citing it as A. compactus [unranked] sarcocephalus (Fr.) Fr., nom. sanct. The abbreviation “nom. sanct.” should not be
added when citing its basionym A. sarcocephalus Fr. (Observ. Mycol. 1: 51. 1815) or when citing subsequent combinations such as Psathyrella
sarcocephala (Fr.) Singer (in Lilloa 22: 468. 1949). 
SECTION 2
VALID PUBLICATION AND TYPIFICATION OF NAMES
ARTICLE F.4
MISPLACED RANK-DENOTING TERMS
F.4.1. A name is not validly published if it is given to a taxon of which the rank is at the same time, contrary to Art. 5,
denoted by a misplaced term (Art. 37.6), but an exception is made for names of the subdivisions of genera termed tribes
(tribus) in Fries’s Systema mycologicum, which are treated as validly published names of unranked subdivisions of genera.
Ex. 1. Agaricus “tribus” [unranked] Pholiota Fr. (Syst. Mycol. 1: 240. 1821), sanctioned in the same work, is the validly published basionym of
the generic name Pholiota (Fr.) P. Kumm. (Führer Pilzk.: 22. 1871) (see Art. 41 Ex. 9).
ARTICLE F.5
REGISTRATION OF NAMES AND NOMENCLATURAL ACTS
F.5.1. In order to be validly published, nomenclatural novelties (Art. 6 Note 4) applied to organisms treated as fungi
under this Code (Pre. 8; including fossil fungi and lichen-forming fungi) and published on or after 1 January 2013
must, in the protologue, include citation of the identifier issued for the name by a recognized repository (Art. F.5.3).
Ex. 1. The protologue of Albugo arenosa Mirzaee & Thines (in Mycol. Prog. 12: 50. 2013) complies with Art. F.5.1 because it includes citation
of “MB 564515”, an identifier issued by MycoBank, one of three recognized repositories. The decision by the Nomenclature Committee for
Fungi to appoint (Art. F.5.3) Fungal Names, Index Fungorum, and MycoBank as repositories (Redhead & Norvell in Taxon 62: 173–174.
2013) was ratified (Art. F.5.3) by the 10th International Mycological Congress (May in Taxon 66: 484. 2017).
Ex. 2. The designation “Austropleospora archidendri” (Ariyawansa & al. in Fungal Diversity 75: 64. 2015) is not a validly published new com-
bination based on Paraconiothyrium archidendri Verkley & al. (in Persoonia 32: 37. 2014) because it was published without citing an identifier
issued by a recognized repository, even though the recognized repository Index Fungorum had previously issued the identifier “IF 551419” for
the intended new combination.
Ex. 3. The designation “Priceomyces fermenticarens” (Gouliamova & al. in Persoonia 36: 429. 2016), intended as a new combination, was published
with the identifier “MB 310255”, which refers to the identifier “IF 310255” that had been assigned to the intended basionym, Candida fermentica-
rens Van der Walt & P. B. Baker (in Bothalia 12: 561. 1978) by Index Fungorum prior to registration becoming mandatory. The recognized reposi-
tory MycoBank assigned the identifier “MB 818676” for the intended new combination after its publication, but because no identifier was issued
prior to its publication the intended combination was not validly published. Priceomyces fermenticarens (Van der Walt & P. B. Baker) Gouliam. &
al. (in Persoonia 39: 289. 2017) was subsequently validly published with citation of the identifier “MB 818692”, newly issued by MycoBank.
F.5.2. For an identifier to be issued by a recognized repository as required by Art. F.5.1, the minimum elements of infor-
mation that must be accessioned by author(s) of scientific names are the proposed name itself and those elements re-
quired for valid publication under Art. 38.1(a) and 39.2 (validating description or diagnosis) and Art. 40.1 and 40.7 (type)
or Art. 41.5 (reference to the basionym or replaced synonym). When the accessioned and subsequently published infor-
mation for a name with a given identifier differ, the published information is considered definitive.2
2It is the practice of repositories to assign a new identifier when an orthographical correction is made to a name subsequent to the protologue.

Note 1. Issuance of an identifier by a recognized repository presumes subsequent fulfilment of the requirements for valid
publication of the name (Art. 32–45, F.5.1, and F.5.2) but does not in itself constitute or guarantee valid publication.
Note 2. The words “name” and “names” are used in Art. F.5.1 and F.5.2 for names that may not yet be validly published, in
which case the definition in Art. 6.3 does not apply.
F.5.3. The Nomenclature Committee for Fungi (see Div. III Prov. 7) has the power to (a) appoint one or more local-
ized or decentralized, open and accessible electronic repositories to accession the information required by Art. F.5.2
and F.5.5 and issue the identifiers required by Art. F.5.1 and F.5.4; (b) cancel such appointment at its discretion; and
(c) set aside the requirements of Art. F.5.1, F.5.2, F.5.4, and F.5.5, should the repository mechanism, or essential parts
thereof, cease to function. Decisions made by this Committee under these powers are subject to ratification by a sub-
sequent International Mycological Congress.
F.5.4. For purposes of priority (Art. 9.19, 9.20, and 10.5), designation of a type, on or after 1 January 2019, of the
name of an organism treated as a fungus under this Code (Pre. 8), is achieved only if an identifier issued for the type
designation by a recognized repository (Art. F.5.3) is cited.
Note 3. Art. F.5.4 applies only to the designation of lectotypes (and their equivalents under Art. 10), neotypes, and epitypes; it
does not apply to the designation of a holotype when publishing the name of a new taxon, for which see Art. F.5.2.
F.5.5. For an identifier to be issued by a recognized repository as required by Art. F.5.4, the minimum elements of in-
formation that must be accessioned by author(s) of type designations are the name being typified, the author desig-
nating the type, and those elements required by Art. 9.21, 9.22, and 9.23.
Note 4. Issuance of an identifier by a recognized repository presumes subsequent fulfilment of the requirements for effective
type designation (Art. 7.8–7.11 and F.5.4) but does not in itself constitute or guarantee a type designation.
F.5.6. When the identifier issued for a name by a recognized repository is cited incorrectly in the protologue, this is
treated as a correctable error not preventing valid publication of the name, provided that the identifier was issued
prior to the protologue.
Ex. 4. The identifier “MB 564220” was issued by MycoBank for Cortinarius peristeris Soop (in Bresadoliana 1: 22. 2013) prior to publication
of the name. Even though the identifier was incorrectly cited as “MB 564” in the protologue, the name is validly published.
F.5.7. An identifier remains associated with the name or designation for which it was issued. If, when published, a
designation for which an identifier has been issued does not meet other requirements for valid publication, in order
for that designation to become a validly published name, a new identifier must be obtained.
Ex. 5. The designation “Nigelia” (Luangsa-ard & al. in Mycol. Progr. 16: 378. 2017) was published without citation of an identifier. MycoBank
assigned the identifier “MB 823565” for this designation after publication. The designation was later validated as Nigelia Luangsa-ard & al. (in
Index Fungorum 345: 1. 2017) with citation of the identifier “IF 553229” newly issued by Index Fungorum.
F.5.8. When the identifier issued for a type designation by a recognized repository is cited incorrectly in the typifying
publication, this is treated as a correctable error not preventing designation of the type, provided that the identifier
was issued prior to the typifying publication. 
Recommendation F.5A
F.5A.1. Authors of names of organisms treated as fungi are encouraged to (a) deposit the required elements of information for
any nomenclatural novelty in a recognized repository as soon as possible after a work is accepted for publication, so as to obtain
identifiers for each nomenclatural novelty; (b) inform the recognized repository that issued the identifier of the complete biblio-
graphic details upon publication of the name, including volume and part number, page number, date of publication, and (for
books) the publisher and place of publication; and (c) upon publication of a name, supply an electronic version of the publica-
tion to the recognized repository that issued the identifier associated with the name.

F.5A.2. In addition to meeting the requirements for effective publication of choices of name (Art. 11.5 and 53.5), orthography
(Art. 61.3), or gender (Art. 62.3), those publishing such choices for names of organisms treated as fungi are encouraged to rec-
ord the choice in a recognized repository (Art. F.5.3) and cite the identifier in the place of publication.
SECTION 3
REJECTION OF NAMES
ARTICLE F.6
F.6.1. The name of a taxon treated as a fungus published on or after 1 January 2019 is illegitimate if it is a later
homonym of a prokaryotic or protozoan name (see also Art. 54 and Rec. 54A).
ARTICLE F.7
F.7.1. In the interest of nomenclatural stability, for organisms treated as fungi, lists of names proposed for rejection
may be submitted to the General Committee, which will refer them to the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi (see
Div. III Prov. 2.2, 7.9, and 7.10) for examination by subcommittees established by that Committee in consultation
with the General Committee and appropriate international bodies. Names on these lists, which become part of the
Appendices of the Code once reviewed and approved by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi and the General
Committee (see Art. 56.3 and Rec. 56A.1), are to be treated as rejected under Art. 56.1, except that they may become
eligible for use by conservation under Art. 14 (see also Art. F.2.1).
SECTION 4
NAMES OF FUNGI WITH A PLEOMORPHIC LIFE CYCLE
ARTICLE F.8
F.8.1. A name published prior to 1 January 2013 for a taxon of non-lichen-forming Ascomycota and Basidiomycota,
with the intent or implied intent of applying to or being typified by one particular morph (e.g. anamorph or teleo-
morph; see Note 2), may be legitimate even if it otherwise would be illegitimate under Art. 52 on account of the pro-
tologue including a type (as defined in Art. 52.2) referable to a different morph. If the name is otherwise legitimate, it
competes for priority (Art. 11.3 and 11.4).
Ex. 1. Penicillium brefeldianum B. O. Dodge (in Mycologia 25: 92. 1933) was described and based on a type with both the anamorph and tele-
omorph (and therefore necessarily typified by the teleomorph element alone under editions of the Code prior to the Melbourne Code of
2012). The combination Eupenicillium brefeldianum (B. O. Dodge) Stolk & D. B. Scott (in Persoonia 4: 400. 1967) for the teleomorph is legit-
imate. Penicillium dodgei Pitt (Gen. Penicillium: 117. 1980), typified by the anamorph in a dried culture “derived from Dodge’s type”, did not
include the teleomorphic type of P. brefeldianum and therefore it too is legitimate. However, when considered a species of Penicillium, the
correct name for all its states is P. brefeldianum.
Note 1. Except as provided in Art. F.8.1, names of fungi with mitotic asexual morphs (anamorphs) as well as a meiotic sexual
morph (teleomorph) must conform to the same provisions of this Code as all other fungi.
Note 2. Editions of the Code prior to the Melbourne Code of 2012 provided for separate names for mitotic asexual morphs (ana-
morphs) of certain pleomorphic fungi and required that the name applicable to the whole fungus be typified by a meiotic sexual
morph (teleomorph). Under the current Code, however, all legitimate fungal names are treated equally for the purposes of es-
tablishing priority, regardless of the life-history stage of the type (see also Art. F.2.1).
Ex. 2. Mycosphaerella aleuritidis (Miyake) S. H. Ou (in Sinensia 11: 183. 1940), when published as a new combination, was accompanied by a
Latin diagnosis of the newly discovered teleomorph corresponding to the anamorph on which the basionym Cercospora aleuritidis Miyake (in
Bot. Mag. (Tokyo) 26: 66. 1912) was typified. Under editions of the Code prior to the Melbourne Code of 2012, M. aleuritidis was considered
to be the name of a new species with a teleomorph type, dating from 1940, and with authorship attributed solely to Ou. Under the current
Code, the name is cited as originally published, M. aleuritidis (Miyake) S. H. Ou, and is typified by the type of the basionym.

May et al. IMA Fungus (2019) 10:21  Page 14 of 14
Ex. 3. In the protologue of the teleomorph-typified Venturia acerina Plakidas ex M. E. Barr (in Canad. J. Bot. 46: 814. 1968) the anamorph-
typified Cladosporium humile Davis (in Trans. Wisconsin Acad. Sci. 19: 702. 1919) was included as a synonym. Because it was published prior
to 1 January 2013, the name V. acerina is not illegitimate, but C. humile is the earliest legitimate name at the rank of species.
Note 3. Names proposed simultaneously for separate morphs (e.g. anamorph and teleomorph) of a taxon of non-lichen-forming
Ascomycota and Basidiomycota are necessarily heterotypic and are not therefore alternative names as defined by Art. 36.3.
Ex. 4. Hypocrea dorotheae Samuels & Dodd and Trichoderma dorotheae Samuels & Dodd were simultaneously validly published (in Stud.
Mycol. 56: 112. 2006) for what the authors considered a single species with Samuels & Dodd 8657 (PDD 83839) as the holotype. Because
these names were published before 1 January 2013 (see Art. F.8.1 and Note 2), and because the authors explicitly indicated that the name T.
dorotheae was typified by the anamorphic element of PDD 83839, both names are validly published and legitimate. They are not alternative
names as defined in Art. 36.3. 
SECTION 5
ORTHOGRAPHY OF NAMES
ARTICLE F.9
F.9.1. Epithets of fungal names derived from the generic name of an associated organism are to be spelled in
accordance with the accepted spelling of the name of that organism; other spellings are regarded as orthographical
variants to be corrected (see Art. 61).
Ex. 1. Phyllachora ‘anonicola’ Chardón (in Mycologia 32: 190. 1940) is to be corrected to P. annonicola in accordance with the accepted spell-
ing of Annona L.; Meliola ‘albizziae’ Hansf. & Deighton (in Mycol. Pap. 23: 26. 1948) is to be corrected to M. albiziae in accordance with the
accepted spelling of Albizia Durazz.
Ex. 2. Dimeromyces ‘corynitis’ Thaxter (in Proc. Amer. Acad. Arts 48: 157. 1912) was stated to occur “On the elytra of Corynites ruficollis Fabr.”,
but the name of the host, a species of beetle, is correctly spelled Corynetes ruficollis. The fungal name is therefore to be spelled D. corynetis.
SECTION 6
AUTHOR CITATIONS
ARTICLE F.10
F.10.1. For names of organisms treated as fungi, the identifier issued for the name by a recognized repository (Art.
F.5.1) may be used subsequent to the protologue in place of an author citation for the name but not to replace the
name itself (see also Art. 22.1 and 26.1). 
Recommendation F.10A
F.10A.1. An identifier used in place of an author citation as permitted by Art. F.10.1 should be presented with the symbol # pre-
ceding the numerical part of the identifier, and the resulting string should be enclosed in square brackets. In electronic publica-
tions, this string should be provided with a direct and stable link to the corresponding record in one of the recognized
repositories.
Ex. 1. Astrothelium meristosporoides [#816706]. The direct and stable link to a record in a recognized repository would be either [URL: "http://www.mycobank.org/MB/816706"] http://www.
 mycobank.org/MB/816706 or [URL: "http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=816706"] http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=816706.
