The Exorcist
The Exorcist is a 1973 American [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_horror_film"] supernatural horror film
directed by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Friedkin"] William Friedkin and written for the screen by
 William Peter Blatty, based on his 1971 novel of the same
 name. The film stars Ellen Burstyn, Max von Sydow, Lee J.
Cobb, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitty_Winn"] Kitty Winn, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_MacGowran"] Jack MacGowran (in his final film role),
 Jason Miller and Linda Blair. It is the first installment in The
Exorcist film series, and follows the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_possession"] demonic possession of a
young girl and her mother's attempt to rescue her through an
exorcism conducted by a pair of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism"] Catholic priests. 
The Exorcist
Despite the book's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bestseller"] bestseller status, Blatty, who produced, and
Friedkin, his choice for director, had difficulty casting the film.
After turning down, or being turned down by, major stars of
the era, they cast Burstyn, a relative unknown, as well as
unknowns Blair and Miller (author of a hit play with no film
acting experience);  the casting choices were vigorously
opposed by studio executives at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Pictures"] Warner Bros. Pictures.
 Principal photography was also difficult. A fire destroyed the
majority of the set, and Blair and Burstyn suffered long-term
injuries in on-set accidents. Ultimately production took twice
as long as scheduled and cost more than twice the initial
budget.
The Exorcist was released in 24 theaters in the United States
and Canada in late December 1973. Despite initial mixed
critical reviews, audiences flocked to it, waiting in long lines
during winter weather and many doing so more than once.
Some viewers suffered adverse physical reactions, fainting or
vomiting to scenes in which the protagonist undergoes a
realistic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_angiography"] cerebral angiography and later violently masturbates
with a crucifix. Heart attacks and a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"] miscarriage were reported;
a psychiatric journal published a paper on "cinematic neurosis"
triggered by the film. Many children were allowed to see the
film, leading to charges that the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system"] MPAA ratings board had
accommodated Warner Bros by giving the film an R-rating
instead of the X-rating they thought it deserved, in order to
ensure its commercial success. Several cities attempted to ban
it outright or prevent children from attending.
The cultural conversation around the film, which also
encompassed its treatment of Catholicism, helped it become
 the first horror film to be nominated for the Academy Award
for Best Picture,[4][5] one of ten Academy Awards for which it
was nominated, winning for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Adapted_Screenplay"] Best Adapted Screenplay and
 Best Sound. It was the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_R-rated_films"] highest-grossing R-rated horror film
(unadjusted for inflation) until the 2017 release of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_(2017_film)"] It. The

Exorcist has had a significant influence on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_culture"] popular culture[6][7]
and has received critical acclaim, with several publications
regarding it as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_films_considered_the_best"] one of the greatest horror films ever made.[5]
English film critic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kermode"] Mark Kermode named it his "favorite film
of all time".[8] In 2010, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress"] Library of Congress selected the
film to be preserved in its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Registry"] National Film Registry, citing it as
"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".[9][10][11]

Plot
Theatrical cut
In northern Iraq, Catholic priest [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lankester_Merrin"] Lankester Merrin participates in an archaeological dig which unearths a
medallion of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Joseph"] Saint Joseph and an artifact representing Pazuzu, an ancient demon. As Merrin prepares to
leave Iraq, he encounters a large statue of Pazuzu and observes two dogs fighting in the desert.
In Georgetown, actress Chris MacNeil works on a film directed by her friend Burke Dennings. A
temporary resident, Chris lives in a well-appointed house with servants and her daughter Regan.
Georgetown-based priest Damien Karras visits his mother in New York. He confides to a colleague that he
feels unfit in his role as counselor to other priests, citing a crisis of faith. Chris hears noises in the attic, and
Regan tells her of an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_friend"] imaginary friend named "Captain Howdy". In a local church, a statue of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary,_mother_of_Jesus"] Mary is
found desecrated.
Chris hosts a party. Karras' friend Father Dyer explains Karras' role as a counselor, mentioning that his
mother died recently. Regan appears and urinates on the carpet. After Chris puts Regan to bed, her bed
shakes violently. Dyer consoles Karras, and Karras expresses guilt at not having been with his mother
when she died. Karras dreams of his mother, a Saint Joseph medallion and—briefly—a demonic face.
Regan becomes violent. She is subjected to several medical tests which fail to find anything physiologically
wrong with her. During a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_call"] house call, a demon [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_possession"] possesses Regan's body; the possessed Regan exhibits
abnormal strength. One night, Chris finds the house empty except for a sleeping Regan. Dennings is found
dead at the foot of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcist_steps"] an outdoor staircase beneath Regan's window. Homicide detective William Kinderman
questions Karras, confiding that Dennings' body was found with its head turned backward.
Regan's condition worsens, and her body becomes covered with sores. A doctor mentions exorcism as a
remote option, suggesting a possible psychological benefit. Kinderman visits Chris, explaining that the only
plausible explanation for Dennings' death is that he was pushed from Regan's window. As Kinderman
leaves, the possessed Regan stabs her genitals with a crucifix. To Chris' horror, the possessed Regan turns
her head backwards and speaks in Dennings' voice. The possessed Regan is confined to her bedroom.
 Chris seeks out Karras, who visits Regan. Over two meetings, the possessed Regan claims to be the Devil
himself, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting"] projectile vomits into Karras' face, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaking_in_tongues"] speaks in tongues, and reacts violently when tap water is
sprinkled on her, which Karras had claimed was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_water"] holy water—a point against genuine possession. The
demon says it will remain in Regan until she is dead. Desperate, Chris confides that the possessed Regan
killed Dennings. At night, Regan's nanny calls Karras to the house. They witness the words "help me"
materialize on Regan's skin. Still ambivalent, Karras nevertheless concludes that an exorcism is warranted.
His superior grants permission on the condition that an experienced priest leads the ritual while Karras
assists. Merrin, having performed an exorcism before, is summoned.
Merrin arrives at the house, warning Karras that the demon uses a psychological attack. As the priests read
from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Ritual"] Roman Ritual, the demon curses them. It focuses on Karras, verbally attacking his loss of faith and
guilt over the circumstances of his mother's death. The priests rest momentarily and Merrin, shaking, takes
nitroglycerin. Karras enters the bedroom where the demon appears as his mother. Showing weakness,
Karras exclaims that the demon is not his mother. Merrin excuses Karras and continues the exorcism by
himself. Karras assures Chris that Regan will not die and re-enters the room, finding Merrin dead. Karras
Page 4
beats the possessed Regan and demands that the demon take him instead. The demon rips a medallion of
 Saint Joseph from Karras' neck and begins to possess him, freeing Regan. Karras hurls himself out the
window, tumbling down the stairs outside. Chris and Kinderman enter the room. Chris embraces the healed
Regan, and Kinderman surveys the violence and confusion. Outside, Dyer administers the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_rites"] last rites as
Karras dies.
The MacNeils prepare to leave, and Father Dyer says goodbye. Despite having no memory of her ordeal,
Regan is moved by the sight of Dyer's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerical_collar"] clerical collar to kiss him on the cheek. As the MacNeils leave,
Chris gives Dyer the medallion found in Regan's room.
Director's cut ending
In 2000, a version of the film known as the "Version You've Never Seen" or the "Extended Director's Cut"
was released. In the ending of this version, when Chris gives Karras' medallion to Dyer, Dyer places it back
in her hand and suggests that she keep it.[12] After she and Regan drive away, Dyer pauses at the top of the
stone steps before walking away and coming across Kinderman, who narrowly missed Chris and Regan's
departure; Kinderman and Dyer begin to develop a friendship.[12][13]

Aspects of Blatty's fiction novel were inspired by the 1949 exorcism performed on an anonymous young
 boy known as "Roland Doe" or "Robbie Mannheim" (pseudonyms) by the Jesuit priest Fr. William S.
Bowdern, who formerly taught at both [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_University"] St. Louis University and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_University_High_School"] St. Louis University High School. Doe's
family became convinced the boy's aggressive behavior was attributable to demonic possession, and called
upon the services of several Catholic priests, including Bowdern, to perform the rite of exorcism. It was one
of three exorcisms to have been sanctioned by the Catholic Church in the United States at that time. Later
analysis by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranormal"] paranormal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism"] skeptics asserted that Doe was likely a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_illness"] mentally ill teenager acting out, as the actual
events likely to have occurred (such as words being carved on skin) were such that they could have been
faked by Doe himself.[5] The novel changed several details of the case, such as changing the sex of the
allegedly possessed victim from a boy to a girl and changing the alleged victim's age.[4][5]
Although Friedkin has admitted he is very reluctant to speak about the factual aspects of the film, he made
the film with the intention of immortalizing the events involving Doe that took place in 1949, and despite
the relatively minor changes that were made, the film depicts everything that could be verified by those
involved. In order to make the film, Friedkin was allowed access to the diaries of the priests involved, as
well as the doctors and nurses; he also discussed the events with Doe's aunt in great detail. Friedkin has
said that he does not believe that the "head-spinning" actually occurred, but this has been disputed. Friedkin
is secular, coming from a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish"] Jewish family.[14]
Casting
The film's lead roles, particularly Regan, were not easily cast.
Although many name stars of the era were considered for the role,
with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacy_Keach"] Stacy Keach actually having signed to play Father Karras at
one point, Blatty and Friedkin ultimately went with less well-
known actors, to the consternation of the studio.
Chris and Father Karras
 The studio wanted Marlon Brando for the role of Lankester
Merrin.[15] Friedkin immediately vetoed this by stating it would 
Blair and Burstyn as Regan and
Chris MacNeil.
become a "Brando movie". [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson"] Jack Nicholson was up for the part of
Karras before Stacy Keach was hired by Blatty. According to Friedkin, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Newman"] Paul Newman also wanted to
portray Karras.[16]
Friedkin then spotted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(playwright)"] Jason Miller following a performance of Miller's play [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Championship_Season"] That Championship Season in
New York, and asked to talk to him. He originally went to talk to Miller solely about the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapsed_Catholic"] lapsed Catholicism
in the play as a background for the film. Since Miller had not read the novel, Friedkin left him a copy.[17]
Three [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list"] A-list actresses of the time were considered for Chris. Friedkin first approached [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn"] Audrey Hepburn,
who said she was willing to take the role but only if the movie could be shot in Rome, since she had moved
to Italy with her husband. Since that would have raised the costs of the movie considerably, as well as
creating language barriers and making it impossible to work with crew members Friedkin was comfortable
with, like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer"] cinematographer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Roizman"] Owen Roizman, he looked next to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Bancroft"] Anne Bancroft. She, too, was willing but
asked if production could be delayed nine months as she had just gotten pregnant. Again, Friedkin declined
her request as he could not wait that long; he also did not think the material was something she would want
 to be working on while tending to a newborn, which might also make it more difficult for her to work. Jane
Fonda, next on the list, purportedly derided the film and turned it down.[17][18]
Page 6
Blatty also suggested his friend [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_MacLaine"] Shirley MacLaine for the part, but Friedkin was hesitant to cast her, given
 her lead role in another possession film, The Possession of Joel Delaney (1971) two years before.[17] Ellen
Burstyn received the part after she phoned Friedkin and emphatically stated that she was "destined" to play
Chris. Studio head [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Ashley"] Ted Ashley vigorously opposed casting her, not only telling Friedkin that he would do
so over his dead body, but dramatizing that opposition by making Friedkin walk over him as he lay on the
floor, then grabbing the director's leg and telling him he would come back from the dead if necessary to
keep Friedkin from doing so. However, no other alternatives emerged, and Ashley relented.[17][19]
With Burstyn now set in the part, Friedkin was surprised when Miller called him back. He had read the
novel, and told the director "that guy is me", referring to Father Karras. Miller had had a Catholic
education, and had studied to be a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit"] Jesuit priest himself for three years at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_University_of_America"] Catholic University of America
until experiencing a crisis of faith, just as Karras at the beginning of the story. Friedkin thanked him for his
interest but told him Keach had already been signed.[17]
 Miller, who had done some stage acting but had never been in a film, asked to at least be given a screen
test. After taking the train to Los Angeles since he [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_flying"] disliked flying, Friedkin had the playwright and Burstyn
do the scene where Chris tells Karras she thinks Regan might be possessed. Afterwards, he had Burstyn
interview Miller about his life with the camera focusing on him from over her shoulder, and finally asked
Miller to say [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)"] Mass as if for the first time.[17]
Burstyn felt that Miller was too short for the part, unlike her boyfriend at the time, whom Friedkin had
auditioned but passed on. The director felt the test was promising but, after viewing the footage the next
morning, realized Miller's "dark good looks, haunted eyes, quiet intensity, and low, compassionate voice",
qualities which to him evoked [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Garfield"] John Garfield, were exactly what the part needed. The studio bought out
Keach's contract.[17]
Supporting roles
 The film's supporting roles were more quickly cast. After Blatty showed Friedkin a photograph of Gerald
Lankester Harding, his inspiration for Father Merrin, Friedkin immediately thought of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_von_Sydow"] Max von Sydow for
the part; he accepted it as soon as he finished reading the script. While out seeing a play starring an actor
who had been recommended to them for the film, Blatty and Friedkin ran into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_J._Cobb"] Lee J. Cobb, which led to
his casting as Lt. Kinderman. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_O%27Malley_(Jesuit)"] Father William O'Malley, another Jesuit priest who taught English and
 theology at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McQuaid_Jesuit_High_School"] McQuaid Jesuit High School outside [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_New_York"] Rochester, New York, had become acquainted with Blatty
through his criticism of the novel. After Blatty introduced him to Friedkin, they decided to cast him as
Father Dyer, a character O'Malley had considered [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clich%C3%A9"] clichéd in the novel.[17]
Greek actor [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titos_Vandis"] Titos Vandis was cast in the role of Father Karras's uncle. He wore a hat in one shot that
obscured his face, as Friedkin felt that Vandis's face would be connected with his previous role in the
 Woody Allen film [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_You_Always_Wanted_to_Know_About_Sex*_(*But_Were_Afraid_to_Ask)_(film)"] Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask).[20]
Regan
The question of whether or not such a young actress, even a talented one, could carry the film on her
 shoulders was an issue from the beginning. Film directors considered for the project were skeptical.[4] Mike
Nichols had turned down the project specifically because he did not believe a 12-year-old girl capable of
playing the part, as well as able to handle the likely psychological stress it would cause, could be found.[17]
The first actresses considered for the part were names known to the public. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamelyn_Ferdin"] Pamelyn Ferdin, a veteran of
science fiction and supernatural drama, was a candidate, but was ultimately turned down because her career
thus far had made her too familiar to the public.[21] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Winchell"] April Winchell was considered, until she developed
Page 7
 pyelonephritis and could not work. Denise Nickerson, who had played Violet Beauregarde in Willy Wonka
 & the Chocolate Factory, was considered, but the material troubled her parents too much.[21] Jamie Lee
Curtis was asked to audition for the role, but her mother [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Leigh"] Janet Leigh declined.[22] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anissa_Jones"] Anissa Jones, known for
her role as Buffy in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Affair"] Family Affair, auditioned for the role, but she too was rejected, for much the same
reason as Ferdin.
Friedkin had started to interview young women as old as 16 who looked young enough to play Regan, but
was not finding any who he thought could.[17] Then Elinore Blair came in unannounced to the director's
New York office with her daughter Linda; the agency representing Linda had not sent her for the part, but
she had previously met with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Pictures"] Warner Bros. Pictures' casting department and then with Friedkin.[23] Both
mother and daughter impressed the director. Elinore was not a typical [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_mother"] stage mother, and Linda's credits
 were primarily in modeling; she was mainly interested in showing and riding horses around her Westport,
Connecticut, home. "[S]mart but not precocious. Cute but not beautiful. A normal, happy twelve-year-old
girl", Friedkin later recalled.[17]
With Linda having demonstrated the personal qualities Friedkin was looking for, he then went on to see
whether she could handle the material. He asked if she knew what The Exorcist was about; she told him
she had read the book. "[I]t's about a little girl who gets possessed by the devil and does a whole bunch of
bad things." Friedkin then asked her what sort of bad things she meant. "[S]he pushes a man out of her
bedroom window and she hits her mother across the face and she masturbates with a crucifix."[17] Friedkin
then asked Linda if she knew what masturbation meant. "It's like jerking off, isn't it?", and she giggled a
little bit. "Have you ever done that?" he asked. "Sure; haven't you?" Linda responded. She was quickly
cast as Regan after tests with Burstyn; Friedkin realized he needed to keep that level of spontaneity on
set.[17]
Friedkin originally intended to use Blair's voice, electronically deepened and roughened, for the demon's
dialogue. Although Friedkin felt this worked fine in some places, he felt scenes with the demon confronting
 the two priests lacked the dramatic power required and selected Oscar-winning actress Mercedes
McCambridge, an experienced voice actress, to provide the demon's voice.[23] After filming, Warner Bros.
did not include a credit for McCambridge, which led to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild"] Screen Actors Guild arbitration before she was
credited for her performance.[24] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Nordine"] Ken Nordine was also considered for the demon's voice, but Friedkin
thought it would be best not to use a man's voice.[25]
Actress [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileen_Dietz"] Eileen Dietz, 15 years older than Blair, stood in for Blair in the crucifix scene, the fistfight with
Father Karras, and other scenes that were too violent or disturbing for Blair to perform. She also appears as
the face of Pazuzu.[26]
Direction
Warners had approached [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Penn"] Arthur Penn, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick"] Stanley Kubrick, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Nichols"] Mike Nichols to direct, all of whom turned the
project down.[27] Originally [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Rydell"] Mark Rydell was hired to direct, but William Peter Blatty insisted on Friedkin
as he had met Friedkin years before.
After a standoff with the studio, which initially refused to budge over Rydell, Blatty eventually got his way.
Principal photography for The Exorcist began on August 21, 1972.[28] The shooting schedule was
estimated to run 105 days, but ultimately ran well over 200.[28]
Friedkin went to extraordinary lengths manipulating the actors, reminiscent of the old Hollywood directing
style, to get the genuine reactions he wanted. Yanked violently around in harnesses, both Blair and Burstyn
suffered back injuries and their painful screams were included in the film.[23] Burstyn injured her back after
landing on her [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coccyx"] coccyx when a stuntman jerked her around using a special effects cable during the scene
Page 8
when Regan slaps her mother.[23] In the documentary Fear of God:
The Making of the Exorcist, the crew member operating the cable
that pulled Burstyn to the ground claimed her chiropractor
examined her after she was injured and told her she would be fine.
It became a chronic injury she has dealt with for the rest of her
career.[29] Burstyn was upset the shot of her screaming in pain was
used in the film. After O'Malley confirmed to Friedkin that he
trusted the director, Friedkin slapped him hard across the face to
generate a deeply solemn reaction for the last rites scene; this
offended the many Catholic crew members on the set. He also fired
blanks[16] without warning on the set to elicit shock from Jason
Miller for a take, and told Miller that the pea soup would hit him in
the chest rather than the face in the projectile vomiting scene,
resulting in his disgusted reaction.
The puppet used in the film.  Filming
The film's opening sequences were
filmed in and near the city of Mosul, Iraq. The archaeological dig site seen
at the film's beginning is the actual site of ancient Hatra, south of Mosul.[30]
Temperatures during the days filming took place there reached 54 °C
(130 °F), limiting shooting to the early mornings and late evening.[31]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcist_steps"] stairs were padded with half-inch-thick (13 mm) rubber to film the
death of the character [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Karras"] Father Damien Karras. Because the house from
which Karras falls was set back slightly from the steps, the film crew
constructed an eastward extension with a false front to the house in order to
film the scene.[32] The stuntman tumbled down the stairs twice.
 Georgetown University students charged people around $5 each to watch
the stunt from the rooftops.[33][34]  The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcist_steps"] "Exorcist steps",
looking north, Georgetown,
Although the film is set in Washington, D.C., many interior scenes were Washington, D.C.
shot in various parts of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City"] New York City. The MacNeil residence interiors
were filmed at CECO Studios in Manhattan.[35] The bedroom set was
refrigerated to capture the authentic icy breath of the actors in the exorcism scenes. It was chilled so much
that a thin layer of snow fell onto the set one humid morning.[36] Since the set lighting warmed the air, it
could only remain cold enough for three minutes of filming at a time.[37] Nevertheless, Blair, who was only
in a thin nightgown while the crew wore cold weather clothing, said she cannot stand being cold.[36]
Exteriors of the MacNeil house were filmed using a family home on 36th and Prospect in Washington, on
the former site of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._D._E._N._Southworth"] E. D. E. N. Southworth's residence.[38] A false wing was constructed to convey that the
windows of Regan's bedroom were close to the steps,[39] while a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansard_roof"] mansard roof was added due to the scene
in which Chris investigates the scratching noises in the attic.[40]
The scenes involving Regan's medical tests were filmed at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University_Medical_Center"] New York University Medical Center and were
performed by actual medical staff that normally carried out the procedures.[31] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bateson"] Paul Bateson, convicted of
 murdering a journalist several years after the film, is the radiographer talking to Regan through the cerebral
angiography.[41] In the film Regan first undergoes an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography"] electroencephalography (EEG),  then the
angiography, and finally a pneumoencephalography.

The scene in which Father Karras listens to the tapes of Regan's
 dialogue was filmed in the basement of Keating Hall at Fordham
University in the Bronx.[42] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_O%27Malley_(Jesuit)"] William O'Malley, who plays Father
Joseph Dyer in the film, is a real-life [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit"] Jesuit and was assistant
professor of theology at Fordham at the time.[43]
The interior of Karras' room at Georgetown was a meticulous
reconstruction of Theology professor Father [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_M._King"] Thomas M. King,
Several scenes were shot in the
 basement of Keating Hall at Fordham
University in the Bronx. 
S.J.'s "corridor Jesuit" room in New North Hall. King's room was
photographed by production staff after a visit by Blatty, a
Georgetown graduate, and Friedkin. Upon returning to New York,
every element of King's room, including posters and books, was
 recreated for the set, including a poster of Pierre Teilhard de
Chardin, S.J., a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology"] theologian on whom the character of Fr. Merrin was loosely based. Georgetown was paid
$1,000 per day of filming, which included both exteriors such as Burstyn's first scene, shot on the steps of
the Flemish Romanesque [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healy_Hall"] Healy Hall, and interiors such as the defilement of the statue of the Virgin Mary
in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dahlgren_Chapel_of_the_Sacred_Heart"] Dahlgren Chapel, or the Archbishop's office, which is actually the office of the president of the
university. One scene was filmed in The Tombs, a student hangout across from the steps that was founded
by a Blatty classmate.[44]
Father Merrin's arrival scene
Father Merrin's arrival scene was filmed on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_von_Sydow"] Max von Sydow's first day of work. The scene where the
elderly priest steps out of a cab and stands in front of the MacNeil residence, silhouetted in a misty
streetlamp's glow and staring up at a beam of light from a bedroom window, is one of the most famous
scenes in the movie. The shot was used for film posters and home DVD/VHS release covers. The scene
 and photo were inspired by the 1954 painting Empire of Light (L'Empire des lumières) by René
Magritte.[45]
"Spider-walk" scene
 Stuntwoman Ann Miles performed the spider-walk scene in November 1972. Friedkin [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deleted_scene"] deleted this scene
against Blatty's objection just prior to the premiere, as he judged the scene as appearing too early in the
film's plot. In the book, the spider-walk is more muted, consisting of Regan following Sharon around near
the floor and flicking a snakelike tongue at her ankles. A take of this version of the scene was filmed but
went unused. However, a different take showing Regan with blood flowing from her mouth was inserted
into the 2000 Director's Cut of the film.
Editing
Special effects
The Exorcist contained a number of special effects, engineered by makeup artist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Smith_(make-up_artist)"] Dick Smith. In one scene
from the film, Max von Sydow is actually wearing more makeup than the possessed girl (Linda Blair). This
was because director Friedkin wanted some very detailed facial close-ups. When this film was made, von
Sydow was 44, though he was made up to look 74.[46] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_McKenzie"] Alan McKenzie stated in his book Hollywood
Tricks of the Trade that the fact "that audiences didn't realize von Sydow was wearing makeup at all is a
tribute to the skills of veteran makeup artist Dick Smith."
Page 10
The scene in which the demonic entity leaves Father Karras was originally achieved by filming Miller in
possession makeup, then stopping the camera and shooting him again with makeup removed. This creates a
noticeable jump in Father Karras' position as he is unpossessed. The 25th anniversary video smooths over
the jumpy transition with a subtle computer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphing"] morphing effect. This update was not featured in prints used for
Warner Bros. 75th anniversary film festivals.
To appease the screenwriter and some fans of The Exorcist, Friedkin reinstated the bloody variant of the
spider-walk scene for the 2000 theatrical re-release of The Exorcist: The Version You've Never Seen. Linda
R. Hager, the lighting double for Linda Blair, was incorrectly credited as the stunt performer. In 2015,
Warner Bros. finally acknowledged that stuntwoman Ann Miles is the only person who performed the
stunt.
Sound effects
Special sound effects for the film were created by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Nagle"] Ron Nagle, Doc Siegel, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Gavira"] Gonzalo Gavira, and Bob
Fine.[47] Nagle spent two weeks recording animal sounds, including bees, dogs, hamsters, and pigs; these
were incorporated into the multilayered mix of the demon's voice.[48] Gavira achieved the sound effect of
Regan's head rotating by twisting a leather wallet.[48][49]
Alleged subliminal imagery
The Exorcist was also at the center of controversy due to its alleged use of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subliminal_message"] subliminal imagery introduced as
special effects during the production of the film. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Bryan_Key"] Wilson Bryan Key wrote a whole chapter on the film in his
book Media Sexploitation alleging repeated use of subliminal and semi-subliminal imagery and sound
effects. Key observed the use of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazuzu"] Pazuzu face (which Key mistakenly assumed was Jason Miller in
death mask makeup, instead of actress [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileen_Dietz"] Eileen Dietz) and claimed that the safety padding on the bedposts
was shaped to cast phallic shadows on the wall and that a skull face is superimposed into one of Father
Merrin's breath clouds. Key also wrote much about the sound design, identifying the use of pig squeals, for
instance, and elaborating on his opinion of the subliminal intent of it all. A detailed article in the
July/August 1991 issue of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Watchdog"] Video Watchdog examined the phenomenon, providing still frames identifying
several uses of subliminal "flashing" throughout the film.[50]
In an interview from the same issue, Friedkin explained, "I saw subliminal cuts in a number of films before
I ever put them in The Exorcist, and I thought it was a very effective storytelling device. ...The subliminal
editing in The Exorcist was done for dramatic effect – to create, achieve, and sustain a kind of dreamlike
state."[51] However, these quick, scary flashes have been labeled "[not] truly subliminal"[52] and "quasi-"
or "semi-subliminal".[53] In an interview in a 1999 book about the film, The Exorcist author Blatty
addressed the controversy by explaining that, "There are no subliminal images. If you can see it, it's not
subliminal."[54]
Titles
The editing of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_sequence"] title sequence was the first major project for the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_title_design"] film title designer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Perri"] Dan Perri. As a result
of the success of The Exorcist, Perri went on to design opening titles for a number of major films including
 Taxi Driver (1976), [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(film)"] Star Wars (1977), and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangs_of_New_York"] Gangs of New York (2002).[55]
Music
Page 11
 Lalo Schifrin's working score was rejected by Friedkin. Schifrin had written six minutes of music for the
initial film trailer but audiences were reportedly too scared by its combination of sights and sounds.
According to Schifrin, Warner Bros. executives told Friedkin to instruct him to tone it down with softer
music, but Friedkin did not relay the message.[56] It has been claimed Schifrin later used the music written
for The Exorcist for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amityville_Horror_(1979_film)"] The Amityville Horror,[57] but he has denied this in interviews. According to The Fear
of God: The Making of the Exorcist[58] on the 25th Anniversary DVD release of the film, Friedkin took the
tapes that Schifrin had recorded and threw them away in the studio parking lot.[59]
In the soundtrack liner notes for his 1977 film, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorcerer_(film)"] Sorcerer, Friedkin said that if he had heard the music of
 Tangerine Dream earlier, then he would have had them score The Exorcist. Instead,[60] he used modern
classical compositions, including portions of the 1972 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello_Concerto_No._1_(Penderecki)"] Cello Concerto No. 1, of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphia"] Polymorphia, and other
 pieces by Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki, Five Pieces for Orchestra by Austrian composer Anton
Webern as well as some original music by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nitzsche"] Jack Nitzsche. The music was heard only during scene
transitions.[61] The 2000 "Version You've Never Seen"[62] features new original music by Steve
Boeddeker, as well as brief source music by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Baxter"] Les Baxter.
What is now considered the "Theme from The Exorcist", the piano-based melody which opens the first part
of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubular_Bells"] Tubular Bells,[63] (the 1973 debut album by English [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_rock"] progressive rock musician [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Oldfield"] Mike Oldfield) became
very popular after the film's release, although Oldfield himself was not impressed with the way his work
was used.[64]
In 1998 a restored and remastered soundtrack was released by Warner Bros. (without Tubular Bells) that
included three pieces from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalo_Schifrin"] Lalo Schifrin's rejected score. The pieces are "Music from the unused Trailer",
an 11-minute "Suite from the Unused Score", and "Rock Ballad (Unused Theme)".[65]
That same year, the Japanese version of the original soundtrack LP did not include the Schifrin pieces but
did include the main theme from Tubular Bells by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Oldfield"] Mike Oldfield, and the movement titled Night of the
Electric Insects from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Crumb"] George Crumb's string quartet [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Angels_(Crumb)"] Black Angels.[66]
Waxwork Records released the score in 2017 on two different variations of 180 gram vinyl, "Pazuzu" with
clear and black smoke and "Exorcism" that featured blue and black smoke. The record was re-mastered
from the original tapes; it included liner notes from Friedkin with art by Justin Erickson from Phantom City
Creative.[67]
The Greek song playing on the radio when Father Karras leaves his mother's house is called "Paramythaki
mou" (My Tale) and is sung by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Kalatzis"] Giannis Kalatzis. Lyric writer [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefteris_Papadopoulos"] Lefteris Papadopoulos has admitted that a
few years later when he was in financial difficulties he asked for some compensation for the intellectual
rights of the song. Part of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Werner_Henze"] Hans Werner Henze's 1966 composition [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia_for_Strings_(Henze)"] Fantasia for Strings is played over the
closing credits.[68][69]
Release
Theatrical run
Upon its December 26, 1973, release, the film received mixed reviews from critics, "ranging from 'classic'
to 'claptrap'".[70] Audience reaction was strong, with many viewers waiting in long lines in cold
temperatures to see it again and again.[71] It opened in 24 theaters grossing $1.9 million in its first week,
setting house records in each theater[72] and within its first month the film had grossed $7.4 million
nationwide, by which time Warners' executives expected it to easily surpass [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Fair_Lady_(film)"] My Fair Lady's $34 million
take to become the studio's most financially successful film.[73]
Page 12
Re-releases
In 1979, the film was re-released theatrically and was converted to 70mm, with its 1.75:1 [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio"] ratio[74]
expanded to 2.20:1 to use all the available screen width that 70mm offers. This was also the first time the
sound was remixed to six-channel [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Stereo"] Dolby Stereo. Almost all video versions feature this soundtrack.
A new edition labeled "The Version You've Never Seen"[75] (later re-labeled "Extended Director's Cut")
was released in theaters on September 22, 2000, and included new additions and changes.
Television versions
The network TV version originally broadcast on CBS in 1980 was edited by Friedkin, who filmed a shot
of the Virgin Mary statue crying blood to replace the desecrated statue image. Friedkin himself delivered
the demon's new, censored dialogue because he was unwilling to work with Mercedes McCambridge
again. The lines "Your mother sucks cocks in hell, Karras, you faithless slime!" and "Shove it up your ass,
you faggot!" were redubbed as "Your mother still rots in hell" and "Shut your face, you faggot". Several of
Chris' lines were redubbed by Burstyn, replacing "Jesus Christ" with "Judas Priest" and omitting the
expletive "fuck". Moments in which Regan masturbates with a crucifix and forces her mother's head into
her crotch are removed, along with most of the character's profanity. There is also a brief alternative shot
shortly after Merrin arrives at the MacNeil house of Regan's face morphing into the demon's white visage
(theatrical versions show only the beginning of the transformation). In some network versions Regan is not
masturbating but having another fit.
 In both the TV-PG and TV-14 rated network edits, the image of the obscenely defiled statue of the Virgin
Mary is intact, appearing on-screen for several more seconds in the TV-14 version. In the original TV
airings, the desecrated statue was replaced by an alternative version[76] showing the face smashed in, but
no other defilement. Edits may vary between networks; non-premium cable networks usually show only
edited/censored versions of the film.
Home media
Special edition 25th anniversary VHS and DVD release
A limited special edition box set was released in 1998 for the film's 25th anniversary; it was limited to
50,000 copies, with available copies circulating around the Internet. There are two versions: a special
edition VHS released on November 10, 1998,[77] and a special edition DVD released on December 1,
1998.[78] The only difference between the two copies is the recording format. A 30th anniversary edition
was released on DVD by Warner Home Video on August 5, 2003.
The 25th Anniversary Special Edition DVD includes the original ending (not used in the theatrical release)
as a special feature: as Father Dyer walks away from the MacNeil residence, he is approached by Lt.
Kinderman. They talk briefly about Regan and the events that took place and then Kinderman invites Dyer
to the movies to see [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuthering_Heights_(1939_film)"] Wuthering Heights. Kinderman quotes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca_(film)"] Casablanca, telling Dyer, "I think this is the
beginning of a beautiful friendship".
The Special Edition DVD contains a 75-minute documentary on the making of The Exorcist titled The
Fear of God,[79] which features screen tests and additional deleted scenes.

In an interview with DVD Review, Friedkin mentioned that he was scheduled to begin work on The
Exorcist Blu-ray on December 2, 2008.[82] This edition features a new restoration, including both the 1973
theatrical version and the 2000 "Version You've Never Seen" (re-labeled as "Extended Director's Cut").[83]
It was released on October 5, 2010.[84][85][86] A 40th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray was released on
October 8, 2013, containing both cuts of the film and many of the previously released bonus features in
addition to two featurettes that revolve around author William Peter Blatty.[87]
The Exorcist: The Complete Anthology
The Exorcist: The Complete Anthology ([URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_set"] box set) was released on DVD on October 10, 2006,[88] and on

and The Exorcist: Extended Director's Cut on the Blu-ray release), the sequels [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcist_II:_The_Heretic"] Exorcist II: The Heretic and
 The Exorcist III, and the prequels Exorcist: The Beginning and Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist. Morgan
Creek, the current owner of the franchise, produced a television series of Blatty's novel, which is also the
basis for the original film.
Reception
Page 14
Box office
Since it was a horror film that had gone well over budget and did not have any major stars in the lead roles,
Warner did not have high expectations for The Exorcist. It did not preview the film for critics and booked
its initial release for only 30 screens in 24 theaters,[72] mostly in large cities.[90] It grossed $1.9 million in its
first week, setting house records in each theater.[72] The huge crowds attracted to the film forced the studio
to expand it into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_release"] wide release very quickly; at the time that releasing strategy was rarely used for anything
but [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_film"] exploitation films (two years later, Universal would learn from The Exorcist and open [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)"] Jaws on 500
screens across the country).[91]
None of the theaters were in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American"] Black neighborhoods such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Central_Los_Angeles"] South Central Los Angeles since the studio did
not expect black people to take much interest in the film; after the theater in predominantly white [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westwood,_Los_Angeles"] Westwood
that had shown the film was overwhelmed with moviegoers from South Central, it was quickly booked into
theaters in that neighborhood.[90] Black American enthusiasm for The Exorcist has been credited with
ending mainstream studio support for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaxploitation"] blaxploitation movies, since Hollywood realized that black audiences
would flock to films that did not have content specifically geared to them.[92]
The film earned $66.3 million in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatrical_rental"] distributors' rentals during its theatrical release in 1974 in the United States
and Canada, becoming the second most popular film of that year (trailing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sting"] The Sting which earned $68.5
million)[93] and Warners' highest-grossing film of all time.[94] The film earned rentals of $46 million
overseas[95] for a worldwide total of $112.3 million.
After several reissues, the film has grossed $232.6 million in the United States and Canada,[96] which when
adjusted for inflation, makes it the ninth [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films_in_the_United_States_and_Canada#Adjusted_for_ticket-price_inflation"] highest-grossing film of all time in the U.S. and Canada and the
top-grossing R-rated film of all time.[97] As of 2019, it has grossed $441 million worldwide.[96] Adjusted
to 2014 prices, The Exorcist has grossed $1.8 billion.[98]
In his non-fiction chronicle of the rise and fall of 1970's Hollywood titled [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Riders,_Raging_Bulls"] Easy Riders, Raging Bulls,
journalist and film historian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Biskind"] Peter Biskind wrote about Warner Bros. reaction to the film becoming a
blockbuster. Biskind explained that the executives were both happy and nervous about it, because the huge
earnings meant that the more free-wheeling and experimental parts of what the studio had done were going
to be erased (or at least greatly limited) in favor of a focus on finding film ideas and projects that would
make huge money.
Critical response
 Stanley Kauffmann, in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic"] The New Republic, wrote, "This is the scariest film I've seen in years – the only
scary film I've seen in years. ...If you want to be shaken – and I found out, while the picture was going, that
that's what I wanted – then The Exorcist will scare the hell out of you".[99][100] Arthur D. Murphy of
 Variety noted that it was "an expert telling of a supernatural horror story. ...The climactic sequences assault
 the senses and the intellect with pure cinematic terror".[101] In the magazine publication Castle of
Frankenstein, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Dante"] Joe Dante called it "an amazing film, and one destined to become at the very least a horror
classic. Director Friedkin's film will be profoundly disturbing to all audiences, especially the more sensitive
and those who tend to 'live' the movies they see. ...Suffice it to say, there has never been anything like this
on the screen before".[102] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert"] Roger Ebert of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times"] Chicago Sun-Times gave the film a complete 4 star review,
praising the actors (particularly Burstyn) and the convincing special effects, but at the end of the review
wrote: "I am not sure exactly what reasons people will have for seeing this movie; surely enjoyment won't
be one, because what we get here aren't the delicious chills of a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Price"] Vincent Price thriller, but raw and painful
experience. Are people so numb they need movies of this intensity in order to feel anything at all?"[103]
Ebert, while praising the film, believed the special effects to be unusually graphic. He wrote: "That it
received an R rating and not the X is stupefying".[103]
Page 15
 Vincent Canby, writing in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times"] The New York Times, dismissed The Exorcist as "a chunk of elegant occultist
claptrap ... a practically impossible film to sit through. ...It establishes a new low for grotesque special
effects."[104] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Sarris"] Andrew Sarris of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Village_Voice"] The Village Voice complained that "Friedkin's biggest weakness is his
inability to provide enough visual information about his characters. ...Whole passages of the movie's
exposition were one long buzz of small talk and name droppings. ...The Exorcist succeeds on one level as
an effectively excruciating entertainment, but on another, deeper level it is a thoroughly evil film".[105]
Writing in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone"] Rolling Stone, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Landau"] Jon Landau felt the film was "nothing more than a religious porn film, the
gaudiest piece of shlock this side of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_B._DeMille"] Cecil B. DeMille (minus that gentleman's wit and ability to tell a
story)."[106]
Angiography scene
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiography"] angiography scene, in which a needle is inserted into Regan's neck and spurts blood, and which
closely imitates the real-life procedure,[107] has been criticized. In his 1986 Guide for the Film Fanatic,
 Danny Peary called it the film's "most needless scene".[108] British comedian [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Garden"] Graeme Garden, who
 qualified as a doctor at university, agreed the scene was "genuinely disturbing" in his review for the New
Scientist; he called it "the really irresponsible feature of this film".[109]
Medical professionals have described the scene as a realistic depiction of the procedure. It is also of
historical interest in the field, as around the time of the film's release, radiologists had begun to stop using
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carotid_artery"] carotid artery for the puncture (as they do in the film) in favor of a more distant artery.[110][111] It has
also been described as the most realistic depiction of a medical procedure in a popular film.[41] In his 2012
commentary on the DVD release of the 2000 cut, Friedkin claimed that the scene was used as a training
film for radiologists for years after the film's release.[107]
Rating controversy
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America"] Motion Picture Association of America's (MPAA) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system"] ratings board had been established several years
before to replace the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Production_Code"] Motion Picture Production Code after it expired in 1968. It had already been criticized
 for its indirect censorship: as many as a third of the films submitted to it had had to be recut after being rated
X, meaning no minors could be admitted. Since many theaters would not show such films, and newspapers
would not run ads for them, the X rating greatly limited a non-pornographic film's commercial
prospects.[90]
While Friedkin wanted more blood and gore in The Exorcist than had been in any Hollywood film
previously, he also needed the film to have an R rating (children admitted only with an adult) to reach a
large audience. Before release, Aaron Stern, the head of the MPAA ratings board, decided to watch the
film himself before the rest of the board. He then called Friedkin and said that since The Exorcist was "an
important film", he would allow it to receive an R rating without any cuts.[90]
Some critics, both anticipating and reacting to reports of the film's effect on children who might be or had
been taken to see it, questioned the R rating. While he had praised the film, Roy Meacham, a critic for
 Metromedia television stations based in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."] Washington, D.C., wrote in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times"] The New York Times in February 1974
that he had strongly cautioned that children should not be allowed to see it at all, a warning his station
repeated for several days. Nevertheless, some had, and he had heard of one girl being taken from the
theater in an ambulance.[112]
In Washington, the film drew strong interest as well since it was a rare film set in the area that did not
involve government activity.[113] Children Meacham saw leaving showings, he recalled, "were drained and
drawn afterward; their eyes had a look I had never seen before". He suggested that the ratings board had
Page 16
somehow yielded to pressure from Warners not to give the film an X rating, which would have likely
limited its economic prospects, and was skeptical of MPAA head [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Valenti"] Jack Valenti's claims that since the film
had no sex or nudity, it could receive an R. After a week in Washington's theaters, Meacham recalled,
authorities cited the crucifix scene to invoke a local ordinance that forbid minors from seeing any scenes
with sexual content even where the actors were fully clothed; police warned theaters that staff would be
arrested if any minors were admitted to The Exorcist.[112]
"The review board [has] surrendered all right to the claim that it provides moral and ethical leadership to the
movie industry", Meacham wrote. He feared that, as a result, communities across the country would feel it
necessary to pass their own, perhaps more restrictive, laws regarding the content of movies that could be
shown in their jurisdictions: "For if the movie industry cannot provide safeguards for minors, authorities
will have to".[112]
Two communities, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston"] Boston and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattiesburg,_Mississippi"] Hattiesburg, Mississippi, attempted to prevent the film from being shown
outright in their jurisdictions. A court in the former city blocked the ban, saying the film did not meet the
 U.S. Supreme Court's standard of obscenity.[114] Nonetheless, in Boston the authorities told theaters they
could not admit any minors despite the R rating.[90] In Mississippi, the theater chain showing the movie
was convicted at trial, but [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_Supreme_Court"] the state's Supreme Court overturned the conviction in 1976, finding that the
 state's obscenity statute was too vague to be enforceable in the wake of the Supreme Court's 1972 Miller v.
California decision which laid down a new standard for obscenity.[115]
 New Yorker film critic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael"] Pauline Kael echoed Meacham's insinuations that the board had yielded to studio
pressure in rating the film R: "If The Exorcist had cost under a million or been made abroad, it would
almost certainly be an X film. But when a movie is as expensive as this one, the [board] doesn't dare give it
an X".[90]
There was also concern that theaters were not strictly enforcing, or even enforcing at all, the R rating,
allowing unaccompanied minors to view the film. Times critic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Van_Gelder"] Lawrence Van Gelder reported that a 16-
year-old girl in California said that not only was she sold a ticket to see the film despite no adult being with
her, others who seemed even younger were able to do so as well.[73] On the other hand, another Times
writer, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Lee_Klemesrud"] Judy Lee Klemesrud, said she saw no unaccompanied minors, and indeed very few minors, when
she went to see the film in Manhattan. Nevertheless, "I think that if a movie ever deserved an X rating
simply because it would keep the kids out of the theater, it is The Exorcist".[71]
 In 1974, Stern's tenure as chairman of the MPAA ratings board ended. His eventual replacement, Richard
Heffner, asked during the interview process about films with controversial ratings, including The Exorcist,
said: "How could anything be worse than this? And it got an R?" After he took over as head, he would
spearhead efforts to be more aggressive with the X rating, especially over violence in films.[90]
Viewing restrictions in UK
The Exorcist was released in London on March 14, 1974.[116] The film was protested against around the
UK by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_Festival_of_Light"] Nationwide Festival of Light, a Christian public action group concerned with the influence of
media on society, and especially on the young. These protests involved members of local clergy and
concerned citizens handing out leaflets to those queuing to see the film, offering spiritual support afterwards
for those who asked for it.[117] A letter-writing campaign to local councils by the Nationwide Festival of
Light led many councils to screen The Exorcist before permitting it to be screened in their council
district.[118] This led to the film's being banned from exhibition in a number of counties, such as in Dinefwr
and Ceredigion in Wales.[119][120]
Page 17
 The Exorcist was available on home video from 1981 in the UK.[121] After the passage of the Video
Recordings Act 1984, the film was submitted to the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Board_of_Film_Classification"] British Board of Film Classification for a home video
certificate. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ferman"] James Ferman, Director of the Board, vetoed the decision to grant a certificate to the film,
despite the majority of the group willing to pass it. It was out of Ferman's concerns that, even with a
proposed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18_(British_Board_of_Film_Classification)"] 18 certificate, the film's notoriety would entice underage viewers to seek it out. As a result, all
video copies of The Exorcist were withdrawn in the UK in 1988 and remained unavailable for purchase
until 1999.[121]
Following a successful re-release in cinemas in 1998, the film was submitted for home video release again
in February 1999,[122] and was passed uncut with an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18_(British_Board_of_Film_Classification)"] 18 certificate, signifying a relaxation of the
censorship rules with relation to home video in the UK, in part due to James Ferman's departure. The film
was shown on terrestrial television in the UK for the first time in 2001, on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4"] Channel 4.[123]
Since release
 The Exorcist set box office records that stood for many years. For almost half a century, until the 2017
adaptation of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King"] Stephen King's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_(novel)"] It, it was the top-grossing R-rated horror film.[124] In 1999, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sixth_Sense"] The Sixth Sense
finally bested The Exorcist as the highest-grossing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural_horror_film"] supernatural horror film; it remains in third place after It
claimed that title as well.[125] On both charts The Exorcist, along with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blair_Witch_Project"] The Blair Witch Project, are the only
20th-century releases in the top 10.[124][125]
 Since its release, The Exorcist's critical reputation has grown considerably. According to the review
aggregator website [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes"] Rotten Tomatoes, 83% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 83
reviews, with an average rating of 8.30/10. The site's critics consensus states: "The Exorcist rides its
supernatural theme to magical effect, with remarkable special effects and an eerie atmosphere, resulting in
one of the scariest films of all time".[126] At Metacritic, which assigns and normalizes scores of critic
reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100 based on 20 critics, indicating "universal
acclaim".[127] Chicago Tribune film critic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Siskel"] Gene Siskel placed it in the top five films released that year.[128]
BBC film critic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kermode"] Mark Kermode believes the film to be the best film ever made, saying: "There's a theory
that great films give back to you whatever it is you bring to them. It's absolutely true with The Exorcist – it
reflects the anxieties of the audience. Some people think it's an outright horror-fest, but I don't. It was
written by a devout Catholic who hoped it would make people think positively about the existence of God.
William Peter Blatty, who wrote the book, thought that if there are demons then there are also angels and
life after death. He couldn't see why people thought it was scary. I've seen it about 200 times and every
time I see something I haven't seen before".[129]
Director [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese"] Martin Scorsese placed The Exorcist on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time.[130]
Directors [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick"] Stanley Kubrick, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Eggers"] Robert Eggers, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Proyas"] Alex Proyas and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fincher"] David Fincher placed The Exorcist as one of
their favorite films.[131][132][133][134] The musician [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John"] Elton John listed the Exorcist in his five favorite films
of all time.[135] In 2008, the film was selected by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_(film_magazine)"] Empire as one of The 500 Greatest Movies Ever
Made.[136] It was also placed on a similar list of 1000 films by The New York Times.[137]
Audience reaction
On December 26 a movie called The Exorcist opened in theatres across the country and since
then all Hell has broken loose.
— [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek"] Newsweek, February 2, 1974, quoted in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_Value_(book)"] Shock Value, by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Zinoman"] Jason Zinoman[90]
Page 18
Despite its mixed reviews and the controversies over its content and viewer reaction, The Exorcist was a
runaway hit. In New York City, where its initial run was limited to a few theaters, patrons endured cold as
severe as 6 °F (−14 °C) sometimes with rain and sleet,[73] waiting for hours in long lines during what is
normally a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dump_months"] slow time of year for the movies to buy tickets, many not for the first time. The crowds gathered
outside theaters, sometimes rioted, and police were called in to quell disturbances in not only New York but
 Kansas City.[90]
 The New York Times asked some of those in line what drew them there. Those who had read the novel
accounted for about a third; they wanted to see if the film could realistically depict some of the scenes in the
book. Others said: "We're here because we're nuts and because we wanted to be part of the madness". A
repeat viewer told the newspaper that it was the best horror film he had seen in decades, "much better than
 Psycho. You feel contaminated when you leave the theater. There's something that is impossible to erase".
Many made a point of saying that they had either never waited in line that long for a movie before, or not in
a long time. "It makes the movie better," [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hurt"] William Hurt, then a drama student at Juilliard, said of the
experience. "The more you pay for something, the more it's worth."[71]
Reports of strong audience reactions were widespread, many including accounts of nausea and fainting. A
woman in New York was said to have [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage"] miscarried during a showing.[71] Some theaters have been said to
have provided "Exorcist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickness_bag"] barf bags";[138] while there are no contemporary reports of even providing regular
sickness bags, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_(magazine)"] Mad magazine depicted one on the cover of its October 1974 issue, which contained a
parody of the film.[113] A reviewer for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinefantastique"] Cinefantastique said that there was so much vomit in the bathroom
at the showing he attended that it was impossible to reach the sinks.[91]
Other theaters arranged for ambulances to be on call. Some patrons had to be helped to leave the places
they had hidden in theaters. Despite its lack of any supernatural content, many audience members found the
angiography, where blood spurts from the tube inserted into Regan's neck, to be the film's most unsettling
scene (Blatty said he only watched it once, while the film was being edited, and avoided it on every other
viewing).[139] Friedkin speculates that it is easier to empathize with Regan in that scene, as compared to
what she suffers while possessed later in the film.[108][109][140][141]
In 1975, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Journal_of_Nervous_and_Mental_Disease"] The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease published a paper by a psychiatrist documenting four
cases of what he called "cinematic neurosis" triggered by viewing the film. In all he believed the neurosis
was already present and merely triggered by viewing scenes in the film, particularly those depicting
Regan's possession. He recommended that treating physicians view the movie with their patient to help him
or her identify the sources of their trauma.[142]
"The Exorcist ... was one of the rare horror movies that became part of the national conversation", wrote
 Jason Zinoman almost 40 years later: "It was a movie you needed to have an opinion about". Three
separate production histories were published. Journalists complained that coverage of the film and its
controversies was distracting the public from the ongoing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal"] Watergate scandal.[90]
Much of the coverage focused on the audience which, in the words of film historian William Paul, "had
become a spectacle equal to the film". Paul cited an [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press"] Associated Press cartoon in which a couple trying to
purchase tickets to the film was told that while the film itself is sold out, "we're selling tickets to the lobby
to watch the audience." He did not think any other film's audience has received as much coverage as The
Exorcist's.[91]
Legal disputes
Page 19
Within a year of The Exorcist's release, two films were quickly made that appeared to appropriate elements
of its plot or production design. Warner took legal action against the producers of both, accusing them of
 copyright infringement. The lawsuits resulted in one film being pulled from distribution and the other one
having to change its advertisements.[143]
 Abby, released almost a year after The Exorcist, put a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaxploitation"] blaxploitation spin on the material. In it a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoruba_people"] Yoruba
demon released during an archeological dig in Africa crosses the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean"] Atlantic Ocean and possesses the
archaeologist's daughter at home in Kentucky. Director [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Girdler"] William Girdler acknowledged the movie was
intended to cash in on the success of The Exorcist. Warner's lawsuit early in 1975 resulted in most prints of
the film being confiscated; the film has rarely been screened since and is not available on any home
media.[144]
Later, in 1975, Warner Bros. brought suit against [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_Ventures_International"] Film Ventures International (FVI) over [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Door_(1974_film)"] Beyond the Door,
which had also been released near the end of 1974, alleging that its main character, also a possessed woman
whose head spins around completely, projectile vomits and speaks with a deep voice when possessed,
 infringed the studio's copyright on Regan. Judge David W. Williams of the United States District Court for
the Central District of California [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_(law)"] held first that since Blatty had based the character on what he was told
was a true story, Regan was not original to either film and thus Warner could not hold a copyright on
Regan. Even if she had been a creation, she could not be copyrighted since she was subordinate to the
story. The writers of the FVI film had also further distanced themselves from an infringement claim by
having their possessed female, Jessica, be a pregnant adult woman.[143]
However, he found that some of Beyond the Door's advertising graphics, such as an image of light coming
from behind a door into a darkened room, and the letter "T" drawn as a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_cross"] Christian cross, were similar
enough to those used to promote The Exorcist that the public could reasonably have been confused into
thinking the two films were the same, or made by the same people, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction"] enjoined FVI from further use of
those graphics.[143]
Legacy
"The Exorcist has done for the horror film what [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)"] 2001 did for science fiction", wrote the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinefantastique"] Cinefantastique
reviewer who had described the vomit-covered bathroom, "legitimizing it in the eyes of thousands who
previously considered horror movies nothing more than a giggle".[91] In the years following, studios
 allotted large budgets to films like The Omen, The Sentinel, Burnt Offerings,  Audrey Rose and The
Amityville Horror, all of which had similar themes or plot elements and cast established stars,[145] who until
then often avoided the genre until their later years.[90]
The film's success led Warner to initiate [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exorcist_II:_The_Heretic"] a sequel, one of the first times a studio had done that with a major
 film, launching a franchise. While many of the classic horror films of the 1930s, like Frankenstein and King
Kong had spawned series of films over the decades, the practice had declined in the 60s, and although there
had been some exceptions, like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bride_of_Frankenstein"] Bride of Frankenstein, most sequels had been considered secondary
properties for the studios. The other big-budget horror films made in the wake of The Exorcist also led to
sequels and franchises of their own.[90]
Accolades
The Exorcist was nominated for ten [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards"] Academy Awards in 1974, winning two. It was the first horror film to
be nominated for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture"] Best Picture.[146] The film was also nominated for seven [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Awards"] Golden Globe Awards, winning
four.[147]

Sequels
 The film has gone on to spawn multiple sequels and an overarching media franchise including a television
series.
Direct sequels
In August 2020, a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)"] reboot of the film from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Creek_Entertainment"] Morgan Creek Entertainment was announced to be in
development.[149][150] The announcement received a generally negative reaction from audiences loyal to
the original and resulted in a petition being launched to have the project canceled.[151][152] Later in
December, Blumhouse and Morgan Creek told that the reboot would be a "direct sequel" to the 1973 film
and that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gordon_Green"] David Gordon Green would direct.[153][154]
Page 21
In July 2021, a trilogy of sequels was revealed to be in development with David Gordon Green attached as
director on each film. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Blum"] Jason Blum will serve as producer, alongside James Robinson and David
Robinson.[155] Burstyn will reprise her role from the original film, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Odom_Jr."] Leslie Odom Jr. co-starring. The
projects will be joint-venture productions between [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blumhouse_Productions"] Blumhouse Productions and Morgan Creek
Entertainment, with [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Pictures"] Universal Pictures serving as distributing company. Universal collaborated with
 Peacock to purchase distribution rights for $400 million total. The second and third films of the trilogy are
being optioned as Peacock exclusive films. The first film is scheduled to be released on October 13, 2023.
Related works
