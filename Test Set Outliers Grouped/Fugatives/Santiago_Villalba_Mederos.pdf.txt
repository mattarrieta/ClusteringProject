Background
Mederos was born on June 5, 1991, and is an alleged murderer
and gang member from the state of Washington. He was 18 years
old when he allegedly killed and wounded multiple people on
different occasions in Washington in 2010.[6] He is a member of
the Eastside Lokotes Sureños (ELS) gang, a violent gang based in
Washington. Mederos is described as Hispanic, 5 feet 10 and 140
pounds, with black hair and brown eyes. He has a tattoo of the
letter “S” on his left shoulder and a tattoo of the letter “E” on his
right shoulder. He speaks fluent English and Spanish.[7]
Murders
On February 7, 2010, Mederos and six other gang members from
 the ELS were out driving a stolen van through Tacoma,
Washington in search for rival gang members. They were after the
gang in retaliation for a shooting that had occurred two days earlier
in which an ELS member was badly wounded. They came across
20-year-old Camille Love and her brother 19-year-old Josh Love.
Camille was driving while Josh was sat in the passenger seat of the
vehicle. They had just left a family dinner and were driving to a 
Photograph taken in 2009

friend's house. The siblings were stopped at a traffic light and were
inside a red car. Josh was wearing a red coat, and red was the color
associated with the rival gang. Mistaking Josh for a rival gang
member, Mederos and at least one other gang member opened fire
into the vehicle. They fatally shot Camille and seriously wounded
Josh. Josh was shot twice and was hit in the arm and on his side.
Neither Josh or Camille were associated with any gang.[8]

Captured
On March 25, 2010, Mederos and another gang member ransacked a car in an apparent robbery in a South
Tacoma alley. They suspected the owner of the car owed the gang money. The duo then got into a fight
with three other men who confronted them. Mederos shot at the group of people as he fled on foot and
fatally shot 25-year-old Saul Lucas-Alfonso. Lucas-Alfonso again was not associated with any gang.[9]
Aftermath
The leader of the Eastside Lokotes Sureños, Juan Zuniga-Gonzalez, was blamed for the murders. The
death of Love led to a crackdown from the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacoma_Police_Department"] Tacoma Police Department against the ELS. Unhappy with
Zuniga's leadership and the unwanted attention from Love's murder, four members of the gang who were in
prison at the time ordered the murder of Zuniga-Gonzalez.[10] On May 12, 2010, Zuniga-Gonzalez was
murdered at his home in Tacoma. 15-year-old Naitaalii Toleafoa and 17-year-old Juan Ortiz drove to
Zuniga's home. Ortiz fatally shot Zuniga in the back of the head in his garage.[11] Both suspects then fled
to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"] Mexico after the assassination. Toleafoa was captured in 2012 and Ortiz was arrested in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City"] Mexico City in
August 2016. Both were extradited from Mexico to stand trial for the murder.[12]
Investigation
Seven ELS gang members were charged in Love's murder.[13] All seven members have now been captured
and are serving prison sentences ranging from 12 to 75 years.[14] According to the FBI, it was believed that
Mederos fled to Mexico after the murders. He had family in the Las Grutas, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrero"] Guerrero and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuernavaca"] Cuernavaca
areas of Mexico. Mederos was charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder, first-degree
conspiracy to commit murder and unlawful possession of a firearm.
Jesus Mederos, the older brother of Santiago Mederos, was arrested in May 2017 in Cuernavaca, Mexico.
Jesus was responsible for the fatal shooting of 18-year-old Robert Tapia at a Tacoma intersection in
October 2006. After the murder he fled to Mexico and spent 12 years on the run before being captured.[15]
The FBI hoped the arrest of Santiago's brother would help in finding him.[16] A reward of $100,000 was
offered by the FBI for information that led to the arrest and extradition of Mederos.[17]
Capture
Mederos was arrested on his 29th birthday on June 5, 2020. According to the FBI, he was captured in
Tenancingo, Mexico, near [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City"] Mexico City. He was flown to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"] Los Angeles to face a federal charge of unlawful
flight to avoid prosecution.[18][19][20]
Two of Mederos's accomplices who were also fugitives were captured not long after his arrest. Fugitive
Andres Maurice Mendez was captured on September 3, 2020. Mendez was wanted in connection with the
murder of Lucas-Alfonso.[21] Fugitive Richard Charles Sanchez was captured on February 10, 2021.
Sanchez was wanted in connection with the murders of both Love and Lucas-Alfonso. Both suspects were
captured in Mexico.[22]
