Abstract 
Multiple sclerosis is a chronic neuroinflammatory disease with a highly heterogeneous disease course. Preventing
lasting disability requires early identification of persons at risk and novel approaches towards patient stratification for
personalized treatment decisions. In this comment, we discuss the importance of large datasets of real-world cohorts
in order to address this unmet need.
Keywords:  Biomarkers, Multi-omics, Patient stratification, Personalized treatment
Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune-medi-
ated disease affecting the central nervous system (CNS) 
through inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. 
Although thousands of patients have benefitted from the
recent introduction of highly efficient immunotherapies, 
including monoclonal antibodies against integrins (natal-
izumab), CD52 (alemtuzumab), and CD20 (ocrelizumab, 
ofatumumab),  there is also a considerable proportion
of patients who experience ongoing disease activity and
progression of disability. Within 20 years of diagnosis, 
30–60% of patients with initial episodic clinical attacks
followed by complete or partial recovery (so-called
relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS)) convert to a secondary
progressive disease course (SPMS) with relapse-inde-
pendent disability progression resulting in severe limita-
tions of the quality of life, whereas others are spared from
persisting neurological deficits despite long disease dura-
tion and old age [1]. This apparent heterogeneity between
individual patients highlights the importance of more
personalized treatment approaches, especially in order to
prevent disease progression. Real-world cohorts are a key

element to address this unmet need, since datasets from
large observational studies, registries, and multi-omics 
approaches allow pharmaceutically independent testing
of hypotheses in the presence of high heterogeneity in
disease pathology, course, therapy response, and occur-
rence of side effects. Of similar importance are novel
methodologies for prognostication and patient stratifi-
cation, in particular, in deeply phenotyped (i.e., patients
with available data on multiple molecular levels) real-
world cohorts.
Prevention and early diagnosis of MS
Insights gained from large international real-world
cohorts demonstrate that early efficacious treatment is
crucial for the long-term outcome of MS patients. How-
ever, there is increasing evidence of substantial neuronal
damage already occurring in presymptomatic patients
(e.g.,  in patients with abnormalities in magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) without clinical symptoms, the
so-called radiologically isolated syndrome) and even in
a prodromal phase that precedes the detection of first
abnormalities in MRI. For example, increased neurofila-
ment light chain (NfL) levels, a biomarker of neuronal
damage, have been detected in blood samples obtained
from seemingly healthy US military personnel up to 6
years before they presented with the first clinical epi-
sode of MS [2]. Moreover, large-scale cognitive testing

of more than 20,000 individuals revealed that men later
receiving a diagnosis of MS had lower cognitive scores
than healthy controls up to 2 years before their first clini-
cal event [3]. These observations highlight that delaying
treatment initiation until clinical disease onset might be
too late for preventing long-term progression of physical
and cognitive impairment. Thus, strategies that enable
the identification of individuals at risk and of patients
with presymptomatic MS along with the initiation of pre-
ventive measures (e.g., modification of known risk factors
like smoking and obesity, disease-specific education, and
early detection examinations) might be a key to overcom-
ing MS progression.
To date, studies by the International Multiple Scle-
rosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC), an international
research collaboration aiming to identify the genetic
basis of MS and its disease course, have identified
233 independent genome-wide significant associa-
tions with MS susceptibility by leveraging genotype
data from more than 48,000 MS patients and almost
70,000 controls [4].  Of note, many of these associa-
tions would not have been detected in smaller-scope
studies due to minor contributions of individual vari-
ants to the overall genetic risk. There have already
been attempts, for example, through the development
of polygenic risk scores, to leverage the knowledge
of these genetic risk variants in order to identify per-
sons at risk to develop MS. In addition, the clinical
implementation of new biomarkers such as serum NfL
[5] may be feasible in the near future. With regard to
enabling an earlier diagnosis, two recent studies con-
ducted in large national registries provide interest-
ing insights into how the population-wide screening
of electronic health records could be used to identify
MS patients before they perceive signs of neurological
deficits. The first is a matched cohort study that used
data linked from health administrative and clinical
databases from four Canadian provinces and included
14,428 MS patients and 72,059 matched controls. The
authors observed a steadily increasing annual health-
care use between 5 years and 1 year before the first
demyelinating event [6]. In a second population-based
observational study, the occurrence of a variety of
clinical disturbances with particular attention to auto-
nomic symptoms, psychiatric conditions, cognitive
impairment, fatigue, and pain was compared between
10,204 patients who would later receive a diagnosis of
MS or clinically isolated syndrome (i.e., a clinical epi-
sode suggestive of MS but not fulfilling the diagnostic
criteria of dissemination in time and space) and 39,448
controls. Remarkably, MS patients had a significantly
higher risk of presenting with symptoms like gastro-
intestinal disturbances, anxiety and mood disorders, 
fatigue, and pain up to 10 years prior to the first men-
tion of an MS diagnosis in their healthcare records. 
The authors suggested that the integration of these
symptoms into the diagnostic procedure might aid in
earlier diagnosis [7].
Findings from these real-world cohort studies have
considerably contributed to our understanding of MS
disease course as they have led to the identification of
a presymptomatic phase (the MS prodrome) and have
highlighted the importance of timely preventive meas-
ures. Moreover, they indicate potential strategies for
the early identification of persons at risk.
Prognostication for personalized treatment
Large datasets and intelligent computational approaches
have laid the foundation for current evidence on demo-
graphic, clinical, MRI, and cerebrospinal fluid- and
blood-based biomarkers with prognostic potential in
MS that may aid patient stratification and consultation. 
For example, in a recent international collaborative work
including almost 3,000 MS patients, higher age at disease
onset, reaching moderate disability levels due to persist-
ing neurological deficits reflected by an Expanded Disa-
bility Status Scale (EDSS) score of at least 3 points within
the first year after disease onset, and impairment of
motor functions were associated with aggressive MS [8].
On the other hand, younger age at disease onset, lower
number of relapses within the first years after onset, and
full recovery from the first relapse were associated with
a favorable disease course, as was being female [9]. An
additional recent study aimed to define MS subtypes
based on a data-driven assessment of MRI alterations
[10]. By applying a novel unsupervised machine learn-
ing algorithm with the ability to model heterogeneity of
phenotypes along with distinct temporal progression pat-
terns in almost 10,000 MRI scans of patients with MS and
healthy controls, the authors identified three MRI-based
subtypes: cortex-led, normal-appearing white matter-
led, and lesion-led. Remarkably, these subtypes differed
with regard to disability progression, disease activity, and
treatment response, which suggests that they reflect dif-
ferent pathobiological mechanisms relevant to disease
manifestation and could be used for patient stratification
and personalized treatment decisions [10].
Importantly, a recent genome-wide association study
of MS disease progression conducted by the IMSGC
was able to demonstrate for the first time that there is a
genetic basis for MS severity that is clearly distinguish-
able from the genetic architecture of MS susceptibility
[11]. This highlights a link between the molecular back-
ground of MS and its phenotypic presentation. However, 
genetic variation alone will not be able to unravel a con-
dition as complex as MS, since it is most probable that

hundreds of weak genetic factors interact with each other
and the environment to elicit disease phenotypes. There-
fore, it is necessary to also investigate data types that
reflect biological processes more dynamically, e.g., in an
integrative multi-omics approach. For example, quantita-
tive gene expression data obtained from transcriptomic
or proteomic studies could be combined with knowledge
of genetic risk factors (after solving interface problems
with existing databases and data harmonization), as is
done in quantitative trait locus analyses that investigate
the associations between risk loci and gene expression
levels, in order to better understand the mechanisms
involved in MS pathogenesis and for the stratification of
patients into disease endotypes. To this aim, deeply phe-
notyped cohorts are needed.

Conclusions
The current major challenges in the management of MS
patients include the identification of persons at risk to
enable preventive strategies and early diagnosis along
with patient stratification for prognostication and tar-
geted treatment decisions. Large real-world cohorts have
already contributed to our understanding of pathology
and disease entities as well as of treatment responses and
associated adverse events. However, in order to further
increase our knowledge of risk factors and to avoid per-
sisting and progressing disability, it is necessary to foster
methodological innovations that will allow us to acquire
more detailed insights into the pathomechanisms, espe-
cially of the difficult-to-target local processes within the
CNS. A key future task for advancing the goal of eventual
translation to the clinic is the generation of large well-
characterized and deeply phenotyped longitudinal data-
sets of patients of diverse ethnic backgrounds and diverse
conditions (e.g.,  response to nutrition, environment, 
therapy) to enable sufficiently powered study designs
that may yield generalizable results. In our opinion, this
can only be achieved through the integration of existing
real-world cohorts including biosample collections, in
an international and multi-disciplinary collaboration of
researchers, clinicians, and patients alike.
