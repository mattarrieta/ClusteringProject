Re: Budget Summary Operating and Capital Budget Recommendations FY2023
Budget Summary FY2023 Operating and Capital Budgets
Framingham was hit particularly hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. For the City, the pandemic meant
additional pandemic response expenses throughout most departments and a shortfall in revenues, 
resulting in unbalanced budgets funded with one-time Federal and State monies on both the expense
and revenue side for FY2020, FY2021, and FY2022. The FY2023 budget aims to correct the imbalance in
the prior year budgets. Revenues were reviewed carefully and projections were developed
conservatively. For FY2023, the City is grateful to the Governor and the City’s legislative delegation for
proposing and supporting a substantial increase in State Aid funding, which helps ease the return to
structurally balanced budgets. On the expense side, the City is examining operations carefully and
working to improve service delivery more efficiently and more cost-effectively. Due to the short-time
for the review of departmental operations, revenue projections, and budget development, much work
will continue into FY2023, the benefits of which will be reaped in FY2024. 
The Budget Summary combines both Operating and Capital budgets for each of the City’s Divisions and
Departments. Each budget summary title sets forth whether the budget is level fund, level service, or an
increase service. Spreadsheets are attached to this memorandum that detail the departmental requests
and the recommendations. There are notes next to certain recommendations for increases or decreases
in the spreadsheets to specific line items to explain the reasoning for the recommended changes. 
The Budget Summary begins with the operating and capital budgets challenges for FY2023 and the near
future. Maintaining a balanced budget while working to meet the service needs of the community
requires careful planning and may require that the manner in which certain services are delivered be
reviewed and possibly modified. 
Looking ahead to the FY2024 budget development, departments will be asked to provide goals and
metrics by which to measure performance in achieving goals. The goals may be annual, multi-year, or
one-time goals. The performance metrics will be used annually to measure progress in achieving the
departmental goals.

FY2023 Preliminary Financial Information
FY2023 Budget Sustainability: Recurring vs. Non-Recurring Revenue and Expenditures
Prior to any discussion of revenue or
expenditures for FY2023, it is important to  Sustainable Budgeting
distinguish recurring and non-recurring revenue
and recurring and non-recurring expenses. 
Recurring revenue is revenue that is anticipated 
•  Recurring revenue covers recurring expenses
•  Non-recurring revenue is used for non-recurring
to be collected year after year. Non-recurring expenses only
revenue is revenue that can only be counted on
in the year in which it is received either because
the amount can vary or because it does not occur annually. The same applies to expenditures. 
Recurring expenditures are those that occur on an annual basis with little change. Non-recurring
expenditures are one-time or periodic expenditures. One of the basic premises of sustainable budgets is
to match revenue and expenditures as recurring and non-recurring, with sufficient recurring revenue to
support recurring expenses and non-recurring revenue used only for non-recurring expenses. 
FY2023 – Return to Sustainable Operating Budgets 
FY2023 will be a difficult year to manage
fiscally. In both FY2021 and FY2022, tax levy

•  Reduce reliance on non-recurring revenue with a

recurring revenue 
revenue was substantially supplemented with
non-recurring funding from Federal
Coronavirus Relief Funds, commonly referred
to CARES and ARPA funding. The revenue has
also been supplemented on an annual basis
with other non-recurring sources of revenue. 
Each of the City’s revenue categories will be reviewed and the historical funding for each revenue
category will be discussed, concluding with a proposal for a model of funding going forward. 
Expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have been reviewed and addressed with each City
department. At this time, it does not appear that items of expenses associated with the pandemic will
be needed. Should that change going forward, appropriate funding sources will need to be determined. 
Financial Indicators
Framingham has Aa2 stable bond rating from Moody’s
thanks to the City’s diverse economy that has resulted
in a steady growth in its tax base. The City has also
taxed substantially below its levy limit. For FY2022, 
the levy limit was $235,742,790, with a total amount
of $200,061,161 raised from taxes on the FY2022 Tax
Recap. This leaves approximately $35 million in
unraised tax levy. 
Moody’s AA2 stable bond rating 
•  Diverse steadily growing tax base
•  Taxing below levy limits
•  Possible upgrade if grow reserves and
liquidity, reduce debt burden, and
strengthen resident income levels
Framingham could see an upgrade in its Aa2 bond rating if there is a growth in reserves and liquidity, a
significant decline in debt burden and strengthening of resident income levels. On the other hand, there
could be a downgrade if there is a decline in reserves and liquidity as a percent of revenue, a multi-year
trend of tax base value declines, or there is continued growth in debt burden. At this time, Framingham
is seeing a decline in its undesignated fund balance for the general fund and in retained earnings from
the Enterprise Fund. The undesignated fund balance is the unreserved portion of the General Fund
Page 2 of 65 
Page 3
balance at fiscal year-end that has not been designated for specific purposes and is available for
appropriation, as reflected in the audited financial statements of the City. Free cash is that portion of
the undesignated fund balance that the Massachusetts Department of Revenue (MassDOR) certifies
may be appropriated. In FY2022, the City’s undesignated fund balance dropped significantly, and, with
it, certified free cash. Unless the City begins generating excess revenue over expenses, the
undesignated fund balance will continue to be substantially depleted and the City runs the risk of not
having any Free Cash certified in the next few budget years. 
The Enterprise Fund undesignated fund balance represents the investment income and surplus after all
expenses have been accounted for. Retained earnings are the amount certified by MassDOR that
remains with the Enterprise Fund and may then be appropriated in the same way as free cash. The
Enterprise Fund has operated at a deficit for the past few years, completely depleting all reserves and
carrying forward into FY2023 a substantial Retained Earnings deficit, which MassDOR will require be
rectified. 
Beginning in FY2023, Framingham can restore its fund balances in the General Fund and the Enterprise
Fund by ensuring continuing growth in
revenue, and, in turn, by supporting
continued tax levy growth through

City’s needs while being fiscally sensible. 
FY2023 Operating and Capital Budget Challenges
The two primary departmental budget challenges for FY2023 that will require careful balancing of
governmental services are collective bargaining settlements and energy costs. Other budget drivers for
the operating budget are health insurance, inflation and debt service costs. Inflation and debt service
costs affect both the operating and capital budgets. 
Collective Bargaining/ Salary Increases
FY2023: During FY2022, the City has received an arbitration
award and has settled a number of collective bargaining
agreements, all of which are included in the recommended
salary for relevant departments. Many of these contracts
were unsettled for two or more years. These contracts were
settled with retroactive salary increases as well as increases
for FY2023. The FY2022 budget did not include a salary
reserve or other funding source for salary growth. 
Accordingly, the FY2023 salary increases for settled 
FY2023 Operating Budget Challenges
•  Collective bargaining/ salary
(Multi-year contractual catch-up) 
•  Energy 
•  Health Insurance 
Page 3 of 65 
Page 4
bargaining units include multiple years of increases, since increases are cumulative. In addition, the
Mayor has requested a 2% increase in salaries for non-union employees, which has also been
recommended for funding in FY2023. The last increase to non-union salary tables was a 1% increase in
FY2018. A number of collective bargaining agreements are currently under negotiations and will also
require funding in FY2023 once settled. 
Looking ahead: Framingham is facing the same labor shortage as the US as a whole. Certain
departments are already facing workforce gaps that will require a rethinking of how services are
delivered in Framingham. The labor shortage may also lead to increased labor costs as well as growing
difficulties in maintaining the workforce. In FY2023 and beyond, the City will need to review
departmental structures, job descriptions, and promotional paths to attract and retain the talent
necessary for City operations. 
Energy Costs
Anticipating inflationary pressure and consequent high
energy costs going forward, a bid for the supply of natural  Energy
gas for the City was issued in an attempt to reign in costs
for FY2023. The bid was timed and the City issued a
contract that will result in approximately $250,000 savings
in natural gas costs in FY2023 compared to FY2022. The 
•  Favorable electricity and gas supply
contracts for FY2023 and FY2024
offset increasing costs of delivery
favorable natural gas contract will be in effect for the
heating seasons in FY 2023, 2024 and 2025. After further analysis and conferring with the City’s energy
consultant, gas budgets were developed using actual expenditures for FY2021 reduced by 15% in FY2023
to reflect the favorable natural gas supply contract and anticipated increases in the cost of delivery of
gas, which is set by the Department of Public Utilities. The contract includes all City departments, 
including the School Department. 
Framingham also benefits from a very favorable electricity supply contract which was effective for part
of FY2022 and is effective in FY2023. Because FY2022 reflects two different contracts and the increase
to the cost of delivery of electricity in FY2023, the electricity budget reflects a 3% reduction from FY2021
actual costs. 
Framingham relies on State bid contracts for vehicle and equipment fuel. There are currently no
contracts available locking in future gasoline and diesel fuel prices for FY2023. 
Looking ahead: The situation in Ukraine has exacerbated the inflationary pressures on energy costs. We
currently project all energy costs to increase and remain at a high level for the next two fiscal years.[URL: "#Page4"] 1
We will continue to monitor contracts carefully and look out for opportunities to control prices. 
Health Insurance 
Framingham is a member of the Group Insurance Commission (GIC). The cost of all plans is increasing
for FY2023. In addition, the City must budget the incremental cost of the transfer of Fallon Health plan

enrollees to another plan, Fallon Health will no longer offer commercial health plans as of June 30, 2022. 
Fallon Health was the least expensive health coverage option. 
Inflation
FY2023: National and worldwide inflationary pressures are
resulting in significantly higher than budgeted bids. The
inflation is cause by a number of factors, including supply
chain bottlenecks resulting from the pandemic, labor

Challenges
shortages, global stimulus funding, the increase in energy •  Inflation
costs, and an increase demand in goods.[URL: "#Page5"] 2 Economists differ •  Debt Service
on the anticipated length of the inflationary pressures and
the result, with one view being that inflation will be here for
an extended period of time while the other believes that inflation will come down as the demand in
goods decreases. 
Looking ahead: Regardless of the length of time that the US sees increased rates of inflation, 
Framingham will face difficult budgets for the next several years. If inflation continues at high levels, the
City will be faced with increased costs of labor and expenses, without increased revenue sources. If
inflation increases with a decrease demand in goods, the U.S. may head into a recession, which will
place further pressure on the revenue side of Framingham’s budget. 
Debt Service
FY2023: Increases in debt service costs as the Federal Reserve Bank increases interest rates to control
inflation will make the costs of capital improvements more expensive. 
Looking ahead: Further increases in interest rates by the Federal Reserve Bank will increase the cost of
capital projects. Continued inflation and rising interest rates will also put pressure on the real estate
market, which, in turn, will put pressure on the revenue side of the budget. As the City moves forward
with capital projects, careful planning and scheduling of projects will be key to achieving the City’s
capital goals. 
2 The International Monetary Fund has recently begun the publication of a series on the future of inflation, where
the IMF seems to support the view that inflation will be with us for a while. 
 https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/03/Future-of-inflation-partI-Agarwal-kimball
The Brookings Institute likewise published about the future of inflation, where it supported a view that inflation
will curb with a decreased demand in consumer goods.

3. Capital Projects and Facilities Management
Capital Projects and Facilities Management: Level Service - Total Operating Budget increase: $37,439
or 1.77%; Total Capital: $170,000 - Energy Sustainability Projects only in FY2023; $767,620 in FY2024
for Energy Sustainability, Design of Mechanical and Roofing Projects
The Capital Projects and Facilities Management budget for FY2023 is level service funded. The operating
budget needs to be reviewed during FY2023 to determine whether the funding at the departmental
level is able to support the level of work to maintain the City’s buildings. A maintenance and capital plan
will be updated for all buildings during FY2023. 
With respect to the capital budget, the departmental request for FY2023-FY2027 includes a number of
roof and HVAC/mechanical projects. Design is recommended for funding in the year prior to the
construction of the various projects. Cost estimates may need adjustments in future years depending
on inflation. For FY2023 and FY2024, while plans are being developed, the focus is on sustainability
projects that would reduce the City’s electricity consumption or convert the City from non-renewable to
renewable energy sources. No Capital Projects and Facilities Management projects are recommended in
FY2023. The Division currently has 22 open projects, many of which are completed but need to be
closed out. The Division has $3.6 million in
capital appropriations, including major exterior Capital Projects and Facilities Management
envelope work at the Memorial Building and  •  Operating Budget
repairs to the Pearl Street Garage. The Capital
Projects and Facilities Management Division also
manages other Divisions’ building construction, 
currently including Fire Station renovations and
upgrades, Library renovations and interior
projects, and the planning of a joint public safety
communications center, all of which will take
place during FY2023.

4. City Clerk
The City Clerk is responsible for two departments: The City Clerk’s Office and Elections. 
City Clerk: Level Service - Total Operating Budget increase: $45,950 or 12.18%; No Capital requested 
While the City Clerk’s office is funded for level services, 
the request is an increase of 12.98% to reflect a
reclassification and compensation analysis for the City
Clerk and Assistant City Clerk. A salary survey will be
conducted to determine the salary for both the City Clerk
and Assistant City Clerk. The salaries used for the budget
are based on the request by the City Clerk. 
City Clerk
•  Level Service Clerk’s Office but review
salary for Clerk and Assistant Clerk
•  Increase of $45,950 or 12.18% 
Elections: Increase Level of Service - Total Operating Budget increase: $81,908 or 131.24%; Capital

Department, under the management of the City Clerk, 
currently has only one full-time employee, an Elections 
•  Increase of $81,908 or 131.24% 
Coordinator. Election workers work part-time. The 
request would bring the total staffing for the Elections Department to 2 full-time employees by adding
an Elections Supervisor. Currently, the City Clerk supplements the staffing needs of the Elections
Department with City Clerk’s Office staff. This has resulted in a backlog of necessary work within the
City Clerk’s Office, including such functions as issuance of vital records. The City Clerk coordinates work
between the two departments to meet the immediate needs of both. The position description for the
new Elections Supervisor position will be reviewed to ensure that work can continue to be coordinated
and functions of each department covered by the other department as needed.

5. Finance Division
As a first step toward Citywide governmental efficiency, each department manager in the Finance
Division was asked to review the staffing and expenses of the department and provide proposals for cost
effective and resource effective delivery of services. The Finance Division is hit particularly hard by labor
shortages. The Finance Division draws upon the same pool of workers as the financial, real estate, and
technology services industries. Each department head was asked to evaluate every vacancy prior to
filling and determine whether there may be a more cost-efficient or labor-efficient way to provide the
services. The FY2023 Finance Division are a good first step to achieving these goals. The review of how
departments provide services will be a continuing discussion, not just within the Finance Division, but
Citywide. 
Accounting: Level Service - Total Operating Budget increase: $23,587 or 3.99%; No Capital Budget
A request to restore a previously cut position in
Accounting is postponed pending review and
reorganization of Citywide financial and administrative
staff during FY2023.

Assessing: Level Service - Total Operating Budget increase: $23,716 or 3.77%; FY2023 Capital Request
postponed to FY2024; Fund Assessing Software Upgrade and Electric Inspection Vehicle in FY2024
The Assessing Department is currently operating with 3.0 full-time employees and a part-time
temporary employee, less than half the positions in the Department, which operates with 7.5 FTEs when
fully staffed. Vacancies include positions from customer service representative to the Chief Assessor
position. Communities statewide are experiencing the same shortage of assessing staff. Assessing is a
key function for the City to accurately issue tax bills. Massachusetts Department of Revenue’s Division
of Local Services issued a Bulletin with guidelines on how municipalities in Massachusetts can share
assessing services. While joining another community may be a possible avenue in the long-term, it is
not viable for FY2023. During the past few months, the CFO’s Office has focused on hiring for vacant
positions. For FY2023, the focus on hiring a Chief Assessor will continue. The Department will be
reorganized to create a Deputy Chief Assessor position. The customer service position, which is an entry
level position, has been advertised and candidates are being interviewed. In addition, two Field
Assessor positions are advertised and some potential candidates will be interviewed shortly. 
In working to fill the needs of the Department for
FY2022, various contracts were awarded to outside
firms to provide some of the assessing functions. 
The City Council has been supportive of the
Departmental needs and the requests to shift
funding as appropriate to provide for contractual
services. 
For FY2023, the personal property function will be
outsourced. This may become a long-term solution
that will be evaluated in the fall. The viability of
candidates for the other open positions will
determine the direction of the Department in
FY2023 and beyond. 
Assessing
•  Operating Budget
o Level Service
o Increase of $23,716 or 3.77% 
o FY2023 – evaluation year for service
delivery and department organization
•  Capital Budget
o Replacement of assessing software
postponed to FY2024
o Purchase electric fleet vehicle (grant) 
Given the level of staffing at this time and the anticipated training required of new staff in FY2023, a
request to upgrade the Assessing Department’s software is postponed to FY2024. In FY2024, the City
Page 13 of 65 
Page 14
will look at both replacing the Assessing Department’s software and purchasing an electrical vehicle for
inspections. The electrical vehicle meets the City’s goals for energy sustainability.

Chief Financial Officer: Increased Level of Service - Total Operating Budget increase: $154,624 or
20.58%; No Capital
The office of the Chief Financial Officer is being
reorganized to review whether certain administrative 
CFO
positions in City departments should be reassigned to  •  Increase Services by adding summer
a more central administrative oversight. The CFO’s
office provides a substantial amount of support the
various divisions and departments throughout the City
on financial, procurement, and grant-related issues. 
This is a first step in evaluating how to most efficiently
support the finance and administrative needs in each 
internship program
•  Restore funding for CFO
•  Centralize financial and
administrative functions 
•  Increase of $154,624 or 20.58% 
department. The office of the CFO has also requested
a new summer internship program with two interns, which is recommended for funding. The FY2023
summer projects would include one intern focusing on updating the budget documents on the website
through the OpenGov portal. The second intern would focus on collecting and updating financial
policies, all of which predate the City form of government in Framingham. The education and training
budget line is also increasing to provide staff in the office with municipal finance training and allow
attendance at municipal finance legal and administrative conferences.

Purchasing: Level Service - Total Operating Budget increase: $88,212 or 43.20%; No Capital Budget
The procurement function in Framingham is

Assistant CFO who is the Chief Procurement Officer
for the City. Much of the purchasing function for the 
•  Begin centralization by moving
procurement staff from DPW to Purchasing
City, however, has operated in a decentralized way. •  Level service
In FY2022, one full-time employee is budgeted in  •  Increase of $88,212 or 43.20% 
Purchasing who is responsible for the coordination
of Citywide procurement and for all departmental
procurements. There is one full-time position funded in the Department of Public Works Administrative
Department that is also entirely dedicated to capital procurement. The remainder of the purchasing
functions are scattered throughout the various departments, including the School Department. The
coordination of multiple employees, who spend only part of their time on procurement can lead to an
inefficient and sometimes lengthy process. The FY2023 budget recommendation continues a process of
centralization that had already been underway and includes consolidating into one department the two
positions whose functions are entirely purchasing. This means that one position funded in DPW has
been moved to the Purchasing Department and is funded in the Purchasing Department in FY2023. 
While moving the position to Purchasing will lead to increased efficiency and better coordination
Citywide, this change is not an increase in services.

Budget increase: $150,633 or 26.08%; No Capital

full funding for both positions. The increase in the operating
budget reflects an adjustment to the cost of living (COLA) for
veterans benefits and the growing number of veterans for whom
the department processes benefits. The City receives 75% 
reimbursement from the State for veterans’ benefits in State Aid.

11. Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Affairs
The Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Affairs Division is comprised of many departments with differing
needs and providing significantly different services to the community. Bringing these diverse
departments under a single umbrella with multiple governing boards and committees is challenging. To
address some of the challenges, one position is being moved from the Division to the Finance Division to
provide broader support to the Division. The Edgell Grove Cemetery Trustees have also requested that
the Cemetery Department be separated from the Division and become a separate division. The City
Charter supports an independent Cemetery Division, which does not affect the FY2023 budget. 
Overall, the Parks, Recreation, and Cultural Affairs budget for FY2023 is recommended to increase to
restore positions that were furloughed during COVID and to begin a multi-year program of increasing
funding for maintenance of the City’s parks, recreational facilities, and cultural assets. 
Council on Aging: Level Service – Total Operating Budget increase

Cemeteries - Increased Level of Service - Total Operating Budget increase: $27,537 or 8.05%; No
Capital
An increased level of services is recommended for the Cemeteries Department, including a small
handicap accessibility project for the Cemetery Office, and the purchase of a leaf blower to enable
better maintenance. The Edgell Grove Cemetery Trustees have approached the Mayor with a request
that the Cemeteries Department be a separate division as set forth in the City Charter. The Cemeteries
budget stands alone and recognizing a Cemeteries as a
separate division does not affect the budget. This document
maintains the Cemeteries in Parks, Recreation, and Cultural 
Cemeteries
Arts because that is the way that the budget was submitted. •  Recognize separate division
There is no request for capital by the Cemeteries •  Increase level of service
Department. The Edgell Grove Cemetery Trustees are
currently reviewing the capital needs of the Edgell Grove
Cemetery and will submit a five-year capital plan in the near
future. The capital projects are anticipated to be funded 
•  Make office handicap accessible
•  Purchase maintenance equipment
•  Increase of $27,537 or 8.05% 
through cemetery trust funds but may require future City
funding.

Loring Arena - Increased Level of Service - Total Operating Budget increase: $68,200 or 8.70%; Total
Capital: $100,000 for Loring Arena sound system in FY2023 and $110,000 for Zamboni replacement in
FY2024
The total budget increase recommended for the Loring Arena is $68,700 or 8.7%.  The pandemic
significantly affected the operations of the Loring Arena and resulted in furloughs and reduction in
programming. The FY2023 restores the furloughed positions since programming is returning to pre-
pandemic levels. The maintenance budget at the Loring Arena is also being increased to reflect the
needs of the facility. The total requested increase for funding for salaries and expenses for the
Department was not recommended for FY2023 due to budgetary constraints and will be reevaluated for
FY2024. The programming at the Arena is revenue generating. The Department will review the fee
schedule to ensure that the fees are updated regularly in line with other communities. 
Two capital projects are recommended for the Loring
Arena in FY2023 and FY2024. The renovation of the Loring Loring Arena
Arena was substantially completed in FY2020. Remaining
funding in the appropriation will be used to upgrade
lighting at the facility for energy efficiency. The
Department has requested funding for sound system
upgrade in FY2023. The lighting and sound upgrades will
finish the Loring Arena renovation. The FY2024 funding 
•  Increase level of service
•  Restore positions furloughed during
pandemic
•  Increase of $68,700 or 8.7% 
•  Finish renovation to Loring Arena –
recommendation is to replace an essential piece of  fund $100,000 for sound system
equipment required for operations.

Parks Department - Increased Level of Service - Total Operating Budget increase: $230,759 or 8.35%;
Total Capital: $8,485,959 in FY2023, including potential purchase of property and $446,677 in FY2024 
The Parks Department operating budget includes restoration of a position referred to as a construction
project manager. The position coordinated with volunteer groups and worked on beautification. The
position also helped with overtime needs of the Department for management during weekends. In
reviewing the job, the position should be a citywide position and the job description will need to be
reviewed and approved. The funding for FY2023 aims to consolidate administration with other Parks, 
Recreation, and Cultural Affairs departments and reallocates one administrative staff salary to the
construction project manager salary. The FY2023 budget also restores seasonal positions that were
furloughed during the pandemic.

The Parks Department capital projects for
FY2023 include replacement of the Winch  Parks Department
Tennis and Basketball courts, replacement of
the Arlington Street playground, and phase I of
a fence and backstop replacement program
throughout the City. The City is seeking

Community Preservation Act funding. The CFO’s  •  Capital Budget
office will work closely with the Parks

and seek appropriate funding for the various

•  Review capital needs and increase capital
investment in parks facilities
•  FY2023 Capital recommendation of
$8,485,959 including purchase of rail trail
property
has been deferred to allow time for potential
alternative funding sources to be explored. The last item in the Parks Department capital request is
funding for the purchase of property at the Bruce Freeman Rail Trail. Given the magnitude of the
projects recommended for funding in FY2023, two smaller projects are recommended in FY2024: the
Arlington Street Park redesign and Phase I of a park signage program. The balance of the recommended
capital is for equipment and vehicle replacement. The total amount of capital recommended for FY2024
is $446,677. The Parks Department has also been working on the planning of the environmental
remediation work necessary at the Mary Dennison Park prior to the construction of the Park, which will
be a major project.

Fire Department: Level Service – Total Operating Budget increase $1,210,659 or 8.12%; Total Capital: 
$988,671 for FY2023 and $1,040,000 for FY2024
While budgeted at level service, the Fire Department operating budget is recommended at an 8.12% 
increase due to a collective bargaining arbitration award. In order to minimize the increase to the
budget, filling a certain number of currently vacant firefighter positions are being deferred to later in the
fiscal year, providing some salary savings. 
The capital budget funds replacement of a fire
engine, a shift commander vehicle and
turnout gear for firefighters. The turnout gear
is the first year of a replacement cycle being
put into place. After the first year of the
replacement cycle in FY2023, the turnout gear
is recommended to be budgeted annually in
the operating budget. The level of funding in
FY2023 is the level required on an annual
basis to provide each firefighter with two sets
of turnout gear no more than 10 years old.

Total Capital: $100,000 for FY2023 and $10,000,000 for FY2024
The Police Department budget is recommended for an increase in service from FY2022 by restoring 4
furloughed Police positions. Due to budgetary constraints, the filling of the positions will be delayed to

operating budget includes an increase to the cost of

replacement for the Police Department cruisers. The
City is purchasing hybrid vehicles for the Police
Department. The cost of each hybrid vehicle is
approximately $5,000 higher than the cost of a non-
hybrid cruiser. The City is exploring grant funding for
the difference in cost but has not secured any
funding to date. 
•  Increase level of service
•  Restore 4 positions furloughed during the
pandemic – delay start of positions to roll
in during FY2023
•  Fund replacement of police cruisers with
hybrid vehicles
•  Recommend $100,000 for site
The capital recommendation for the Police  assessment funding for a joint dispatch
Department is funding of $100,000 for a joint  center – possibly regional
dispatch center. The current dispatch center is too
small for the staff and for the needs of the Police,

Public Works Engineering – Level service with increased funding for capital-funded positions – budget
increase of $194,976 or 20.36% 
The Engineering Department budget is increasing
significantly while maintaining level service due to the
number of positions funded within the capital budget. 
The FY2023 budget recommendation includes funding
2.33 positions previously funded in the capital budget, 
including the Deputy Chief Engineer. Due to
budgetary constraints, there is one additional
engineering position funded through capital, which
would be brought into the FY2024 operating budget. 
The legal budget lines in the Engineering budget have
been removed with the centralization of legal work in
a Legal Department. 
Engineering
•  Move 2.33 capital funded positions
into FY2023 budget – defer 1 capital
funded position to FY2024
•  Remove legal budget and centralize
legal services
•  Budget increase $194,976 or 20.36%

Public Works Highway Department – Level service with increased funding for capital-funded position –
budget increase of $78,894 or 2.07% 
The Public Works Highway Department is being
particularly hard hit by the nationwide labor shortages
for holders of CDL (Commercial Driver License) licenses. 
The FY2023 budget recommends budgeting half of the 8
current vacant positions partly though FY2023 and
providing the needed Highway Department services
through outside vendors. The FY2023 budget could not
support funding for 1 project manager currently funded
through capital, which is deferred until FY2024. Other
cost increases include increases in the costs of supplies, 
contractual services (primarily caused by labor
shortages), and fuel. 
Public Works Highway
•  Shortage of qualified labor
•  Reevaluating manner of delivery of
services
•  Move 1 project manager from capital
budget deferred to FY2024
•  Inflationary pressure on cost of
supplies, contractual services, and
fuel. 
•  Budget increase of $78,894 or 2.07%

Public Works Sanitation Department – Level service budget increase of $544,878 or 11.52%; No
Capital Budget
The Sanitation Department is seeing high increases in its expenses due to the increase costs of fuel and
labor shortages. An inflation measure has been applied to each of the budget lines anticipated to be
affected by inflation. The Sanitation Department’s contract for solid waste disposal and leaf and brush
disposal have also increased substantially in FY2022. The
contracts for solid waste and recycling are currently being
reviewed and may be amended. The contract for leaf and 
Public Works Sanitation
brush disposal will also be reviewed for possible
amendment. The Department is also seeing the shortages in
labor with CDL licenses, which are required for driving
sanitation trucks, which may become problematic going 
•  Level Service
•  Shortage of qualified labor
•  Review of waste disposal contracts
forward.

Public Works Capital
The Public Works Division requested $24.2 million in new projects for FY2023 and an additional $32.4
million in FY2024. A similar approach to capital funding in FY2023 is recommended for DPW as was
recommended for Capital Projects and Facilities Maintenance. There are a total of 18 open projects in
the Capital Plan totaling $3.6 million. In addition, Public Works has a number of projects funded through
Chapter 90 and various grants. Finally, Framingham will receive additional ARPA funds in the first half of
FY2023. 
FY2023 will be a year for Public Works to catch up on open projects. The projects recommended in
FY2023 include annual road maintenance
totaling $2,000,000, various drainage, Public Works Capital
stormwater and water quality projects, including
work on drainage to Waushakum beach, totaling
$950,000, sidewalk repairs and handicap
accessibility on Flagg Drive totaling $572,000. A
roof replacement project for $53,000 at 110
Western Avenue will be deferred due to 
•  FY2023
o $2 million for roads
o $950,000 for stormwater and
drainage, including Waushakum
beach
significantly higher than anticipated costs. The  o $572,000 for sidewalk repairs and
Public Works Division also receives grants that  handicap accessibility on Flagg Drive
supplement the capital appropriations, including
Chapter 90 funding for roads and Municipal
Vulnerability Program funding for flooding and stormwater. The FY2024 budget for Public Works is
recommended to be restored to a baseline of approximately $15 million. The Public Works capital
recommendation going forward is based on three assumptions: first, that a financial model for the
City’s capital plan is developed in FY2023 and the projects recommend fit within the plan; second, that
the Public Works Division has completed some of the open projects and grant opportunities and other
infrastructure funding that is currently available has been exhausted; third, that approximately $15
million annually is financially sustainable. 
As stated earlier, no fleet replacement has been scheduled for FY2023 pending a full review of the
vehicles and equipment in the fleet and creation of a fiscally sustainable replacement cycle.

School Department Capital – FY2023: $10,485,105 and FY2024: $25,862,020
The School Department Capital for FY2023 and FY2024 includes funding for the purchase of the Bethany
property and design for a new elementary school on the property. The Massachusetts School Building
Authority process for seeking grant funding for the construction of the new school. Other capital
projects in FY2023 include roof replacement at the Farley School for $3,375,000. The amount
recommended is more than the amount requested based on a revised cost estimate. The increase is
due to inflation from supply chain disruptions, fuel cost increases, and labor cost increases. The exterior
envelope work at Walsh Middle school is recommended for the requested amount of $1,161,705. The
McCarthy School roof replacement design is recommended for funding with the expectation that an
updated cost estimate will be obtained in FY2023 prior to a recommendation on the construction
appropriation in FY2024. Handicap accessibility
upgrades throughout the School District are
recommended at $300,000. Roof replacements and
exterior envelope work is planned for FY2024, 
continuing the repair and renovation cycle for

17. Operating Reserves – Reserve Fund level funded at $400,000 and Salary Reserve increase
funding at $575,000
The FY2023 budget recommends that the Reserve Fund
be level funded at $400,000 and the Salary Reserve be
funded at $575,000 to cover unsettled collective
bargaining agreements. 
Operating Reserves
•  Level fund Reserve Fund at $400,000
•  Salary Reserve at $575,000
18. Unclassified Expenses
The City has little or no direct control over the expenses budgeted in unclassified expenses. 
Framingham is a member of the Group Insurance
Commission (GIC). The Health Insurance budget is
based on the increases to each health insurance
provider’s premium increases for FY2023. In
addition, the City must budget the incremental
cost of the transfer of Fallon Health plan enrollees
to another plan, since Fallon Health will no longer
offer commercial health plans as of June 30, 2022. 
Fallon Health was the least expensive health
coverage option. While the highest estimate for
the Health Insurance budget is closer to 10%, the
recommended budget increase is 7%.
The budget for the consultant for Medicaid
reimbursement is based on average costs for the
past years. The amount collected by the City
ranges between $1 million and $1.5 million. 
Unclassified Expenses
•  Health Insurance increase of $2,346,714
or 6.96% 
•  Decrease for the Medicaid
reimbursement consultant of $20,000 or
21.05% 
•  Level fund tax title services – no change
•  Retirement assessment increase of
$1,287,976 or 6.9% 
•  Medicare increase of $127,545 or 5.20% 
•  Debt service within the levy increase of
$1,101,580 or 10.07% 
•  Excluded debt service increase $883,150
or 59.54% 
Tax Title services funds the amount required on an annual basis for tax title work. Tax title work results
in payment of delinquent taxes and in property foreclosure generating revenue for the City. 
The retirement budget must equal the assessment of the Retirement Board. 
The Medicare budget is based on total salaries paid. It has been underbudgeted in prior years. The
FY2023 budget should bring the Medicare line to fully budgeting. 
The Debt Service Within the Levy is based on existing debt service schedules. Excluded Debt for FY2023
is also based on existing debt service schedules. Annual debt service is based on projects authorized by
City Council and by voters. This line item needs to be reviewed carefully. There should not be
fluctuations in the amounts that are reflected historically. At this time, there has not been sufficient
time to review and evaluate the financial model for capital planning. Projects should be rolled into a
financial model that allows for fiscally prudent as well as proactive for asset maintenance and
preservation. The budget for debt service should also allow flexibility to market time interest rates
more advantageously. FY2023

FY2023 Projected Revenue (updated May 5, 2022) 
For consistency with required State reporting, projected City revenues are divided into MassDOR
categories. Over the past 10 years, the City has relied less on the tax levy and more on State Aid and
Local Receipts to fund its operating budget. The reliance on both State Aid and Local Receipts can be
problematic since they are sources of funding that the City cannot control. The table below illustrate
the direction in which the City has moved with the various categories of revenue.

FY2023 Revenue Budget Adjustments 
FY2023 projected revenue continues
the same trend in reduced reliance on
•  Account for increased State Aid
•  Decrease reliance on Free Cash and other non-
recurring sources of funding
•  Project Local Receipts realistically
•  Increase Tax Levy to replace FY2022 one-time revenue 
the tax levy versus other sources of
revenue, with some caveats. The
increase in State Aid reliance is based on
the State’s commitment to continued
increased State aid to help cover school
budgets. The decrease in reliance on
•  Return Enterprise Fund to financial viability Free Cash and other sources of funding
reduces the City’s reliance on non-
recurring funding. In FY2022, the City
also relied on one-time funding from ARPA which will not be available in FY2023, and which will need to
be replaced by tax levy. The decrease in reliance on local receipts for FY2023 reflect adjustments made
to provide a more predictable revenue projection for future years. Local receipts have not been
projected accurately in the past resulting in MassDOR notifying the City that the FY2023 budget would
need to include realistic projections when the tax rates are set. Finally, the FY2023 budget reflects the
return to financial sustainability for the Enterprise Fund. The graph below illustrates the trends in the
contribution of each category of revenue to the City’s overall revenue budget. 
Page 50 of 65 
Page 51
Overall the projected FY2023 Revenue budget increases revenue by 5.02%. The largest total dollar
increase is in State Aid at $13M, accounting for 65.5% of the total revenue budget increase for FY2023. 
Please note that the amount of projected net State Aid is almost $1M less totaling $12M, after
accounting for increases in State Assessments. The table below show the FY2023 projected revenue
budget and includes historical information to FY2017.

Analysis of FY2023 Projected Revenue by Revenue Category
1. Community Preservation Act Surcharge 
a. Community Preservation Act is a new tax
surcharge that is separate from the 
CPA
General Fund and is expended upon the  •  Level budget – depends on tax levy
recommendation of the Community
Preservation Committee for the specific
purposes authorized by state statute (preservation of open space, affordable housing, 
historic preservation, and certain types of recreation). The Community Preservation
surcharge in Framingham is 1% of the tax levy subject to certain exclusions. For the
FY2023 Revenue projection, the Community Preservation Act Surcharge is level funded. 
A final number for the budget will be determined in the coming weeks. 
b. Looking ahead: the Community Preservation Committee will be developing guidelines
and an application process for funding of projects within the scope of the CPA. 
Page 51 of 65 
Page 52
Recommendations for possible CPA eligible projects will be developed as part of the 5-
year Capital Investment Plan. 
2. Enterprise Fund
a. The Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund is
currently operating at a deficit, and the  Enterprise Fund – return to sustainability
fund’s retained earnings are also at a
deficit. MassDOR has allowed to City to
amortize its FY2020 deficit of $1.3M over 3
years beginning in FY2022. However, 
because the Enterprise Fund is still
showing a deficit and the deficit increased
in FY2021, MassDOR will not allow the 
•  Bring capital funded positions into
operating budget
•  No new debt service for FY2023
•  Budget full repayment of deficit
•  Eliminate reliance on non-recurring
revenue
amortization in FY2023. The budget for
the Enterprise Fund includes a full
repayment of the deficit as of the end of FY2021 totaling $3.3M. A continuing revenue
to expenditure gap was anticipated in FY2022, which was bridged with one-time ARPA
funding totaling $6.35M, bringing the total anticipated revenue shortfall for FY2023 at
$10M. Beginning in FY2023, the City must operate the Enterprise Fund at a surplus and
recover the retained earnings deficit through water and sewer rates. Otherwise, 
MassDOR will require that the City raise the deficit from the Tax Levy. To that end, the
draft Enterprise Fund expenditures budget will be level funded - including assuming no
increase in debt service for FY2023 - with two exceptions. First the Enterprise Fund
budget will reflect the transfer of positions that are currently funded through capital
projects into the operating budget. These positions are currently being funded through
debt rather than the tax levy, a practice that the City should consider ending. The
second exception is the full repayment of the deficit. If rates are raised to match the
expenditures budget, the City should be able to bring the Enterprise Fund out of deficit
and have sufficient room for gradual increases in rates in coming years. The required
rate increase will also depend on the FY2022 realized revenue, which is still being
projected. 
b. Looking ahead: Projected rates and a revenue model for the Enterprise Fund will be
addressed separately from this discussion. A forecast for predictable and sustainable
budgets and rates will be developed, and a rate hearing will be scheduled later in the
Spring. 
3. All Other
a. The All Other revenue line captures
the Public Access fees from the 
All Other
cable companies that provide
service in Framingham and which 
•  Last year for Health Insurance Trust funds
total approximately $800k to $900k. 
The other elements of this revenue line vary greatly. 
Page 52 of 65 
Page 53
In FY2022 and FY2023, the balance of the $2 million will be comprised of Health
Insurance Trust monies, which will be used in FY2023 but will then be exhausted as a
funding source. 
b. Looking ahead: Beginning in FY2024, this revenue line will be limited to the Public
Access fees, creating a revenue shortfall that will need to be bridged in FY2024. 
4. Free Cash
a. The City’s reliance on Free Cash to balance the operating budget has been uneven over
the past few years. In addition, the amount of Free Cash certified by MassDOR has also
been uneven depending on the amount of undesignated fund balance. The chart below
shows historical fluctuation in
undesignated fund balance and in Free Free Cash
Cash. The City generally shows declining
Free Cash, with a boost in FY2020 due to
2 one-time revenue boosts: an increase
in building permit fees for some large
projects and state reimbursements for 
•  Depleted fund balance with no
source of replenishment
•  Anticipate significantly reduced Free
Cash certification for FY2023
old grant funded projects.  •  Budget conservative revenue and
realistic expenses
In FY2022, the operating budget expenses are supported by $6M in Free Cash. The
FY2022 Free Cash certification was $7.8M. Some of the $7.8M will need to be used in
FY2022 to purchase needed operational and capital items and to supplement the
Page 53 of 65 
Page 54
FY2022 operating budget. The FY2022 operating budget did not include funding for
salary increases. Most employees had not received raises for two fiscal years. In
addition, the City was in arbitration with one union. The arbitration outcome and
settlement of collective bargaining agreements will result in a need to use Free Cash in
FY2022 beyond the amounts already appropriated in FY2021 as part of the budget
process. 
Free Cash results from higher than estimated revenue, one-time revenue, and
operational surplus at the end of the year. Based on the level of undesignated fund
balance at the end of FY2021, which is significantly less than prior years and the
projections regarding revenue surplus FY2022 unbudgeted expenditures, Framingham
should anticipate a much smaller level of Free Cash certified and must reduce its Free
Cash use for FY2023. Accordingly, the FY2023 budget projects Free Cash use at $4
million, a $2 million reduction from FY2022. Initially, it was projected that the Free Cash
budget would decrease by $3 million to $3 million. However, the operating budget
cannot support a 50% cut in Free Cash subsidy. Instead, the reliance on Free Cash will
be reduced over a longer period of time. 
b. Looking ahead: Given the undesignated fund balance at the end of FY2021 and the lack
of anticipated revenue or budgetary surplus to replenish the fund by the end of FY2022, 
the City should anticipate a significantly reduced amount of Free Cash in FY2023. This

will affect the FY2024
budget which is
projected to rely on
no Free Cash. 
Beginning in FY 2023, 
the City should budget
revenue
conservatively to
avoid further revenue shortfalls. Operational expenses should be budgeted realistically, 
which will generally result in 2% and 3% of the budget as Free Cash annually. This would
place Free Cash between $7 million and $11 million. Once Free Cash is stabilized, it can
be looked at as a source of funding the City’s Capital Improvement Plan and as a funding
source for specific items that are classified as capital and included in the CIP but are
either not truly capital items (e.g., Fire Department turnout gear) or are recurring (e.g.,
roads infrastructure investment). Free Cash could also become a source for reserves for
larger projects, allowing the City to reduce excluded debt service burden. In addition, 
changes to capital planning should provide for a higher level of capital investment in the
future. Some changes will require increases to the operating budget. For instance, 
those items that are not capital but currently funded through the capital budget should
be moved to the operating budget in the long term. For those items that are truly
capital but are recurring, the City should consider moving to paying for those items with
cash rather than borrowing. The advantages of this approach will be discussed in
further detail during the CIP review.

Page 55
5. Local Receipts
a. The City overestimated Local Receipts in FY2020 and FY2021. In years prior to FY2020, 
Local Receipts exceeded budget by at least 5% resulting in revenue surplus that
contributed to the undesignated fund balance. FY2019 Local Receipts exceeded budget
significantly due to a particular high year for issuing building permits. This was a one-
year bump only, however. FY2020 and FY2021 assumed higher than average building
permits as well as high assumptions in other categories that resulted in revenue
shortfalls. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to loss of revenue in Local
Receipts, primarily related to Meals Tax and Room Tax. 
The table below show the history of local receipts budgeted versus actual by line. 
Page 55 of 65 
Page 56
b. For FY2023, a budget is recommended based on the average of FY2017 through FY2021.

Local receipts were particularly questioned by MassDOR in FY2022 and need to be
projected conservatively. By presenting a conservative recommendation, the City will
benefit two-fold. First, the City will avoid a revenue deficit, which would then need to
be covered in the following year through the Levy or through service cuts. Second, 
revenue surplus will revert to Free Cash in the following fiscal year, allowing for a
healthy cycle of Free Cash that can then be used to supplement the budget to provide
for non-recurring services or be incorporated in capital planning. Two primary changes
between FY2022 Local Receipts budget and the FY2023 Local Receipts budget is the
drop in miscellaneous non-recurring
revenue, which represent the use of $2.4M Local Receipts
of ARPA funds in FY2022 to replace revenue
loss from the COVID-19 pandemic. All other
adjustments in the budget reflect the 
•  Return to conservative estimates
to avoid revenue shortfalls
average collection of receipts for specific
line items. 
c. Looking ahead: Certain line items in Local Receipts will not longer be collected by the
City beginning in FY2024, such as the rent for the Farley School Building totaling
$400,000. Other line items will need to be reviewed, such as the Impact Fee for
Marijuana establishments. Those revenue sources may result in a readjustment to the
base level for Local Receipts

6. State Aid
a. State Aid distributions to Framingham
have generally increased in the recent
past. The increases, however, have
not been uniform year over year. As
the State Aid amounts have increased, 
the City’s reliance on State Aid, has
also increased.

The FY2023 Proposed Governor’s State Aid includes a $12M increase in State Aid, 
primarily in the Chapter 70 (School Aid) line. The Proposed Governor’s State Aid
increase accounts for more than half of the increase in projected revenue for FY2023. 
As seen in the table below, past experience shows that the Governor’s budget is a good
approximation of the final State Aid budget. The House Preliminary Budget has been
released, which would increase the State Aid bottom line budget by approximately
$200,000. However, it is prudent to wait until the Senate Preliminary budget prior to
adjusting budget projections.

Note: FY2021 had a preliminary and revised Governor's Budget and the Final Budget differed from Conference. This analysis looks at the revised Governor's and the Final Budgets.
A number of fiscal years had a Final Budget that Differed from Conference. This analysis uses the Final Budget rather than Conference.

b. Looking ahead: The City should be cautious. To the extent that FY2023 State Aid is
significantly higher than in FY2022, the expenditure budget recommendation for the
increase should be evaluated to determine the level of confidence that the budget will
be supportable going forward and the effect on revenue or services if State Aid is not
increased commensurate with maintenance of the services going forward. 
7. Tax Levy
a. New Growth: New growth has been stable at just under 1% of the levy for each of the
past 5 years, including during the COVID-19 pandemic. The New Growth projection for
FY2023 is in line with prior year New Growth. 
New Growth as a Percent of Prior Year Levy
FY 2023 Projected FY2022 Tax Recap FY2021 Actual FY2020 Actual FY2019 Actual FY2018 Actual
0.91%  0.97%  0.96%  0.94%  0.92%  0.96%
b. Year-over-year tax levy: the City has not maintained consistent year-over-year tax
levies, with 3 of the last 5 years showing a negative levy after accounting for New
Growth and for excluded debt. While reducing the tax levy can be beneficial because it
maintains unraised tax levy, the City may wish to consider the level of the unraised tax
levy and the consequences to the operating budget of tax levy decreases. Of the last 5
fiscal years, Framingham had 3 years with effective tax levy decreases. In FY2019, the
City experienced a negative tax levy, relying on a significant State Aid increase to
balance its budget. In FY2021, the City faced potential fiscal consequences of the
COVID-19 pandemic. FY2021 showed tripled tax growth indicators. This means that, 
even taking into consideration the effect of excluded debt and new growth, the City cut
its tax revenue. In FY2021, there were cuts made to the expenditures budget and there
was a strong reliance on one-time funding to balance the budget. In FY2022, the City
once again showed a negative year over year tax levy and once again relied on one-time
sources of funding to balance the budget. 
The FY2023 projected revenue raises the tax
levy by the allowable 2.5%, accounts for
New Growth, and increases taxes to meet
the authorized excluded debt. Balancing the
FY2023 budget will be difficult even with a
2.5% increase in the levy, because of the 
Tax Levy
•  1% projection for New Growth
•  2.5% increase in tax levy
Page 58 of 65 
Page 59
elimination of one-time revenue and the reduction in non-recurring revenue to fund
operations. 
c. Looking ahead: a strong economic development plan is necessary to provide for
consistent New Growth. In addition, formulating multi-year expense projections will
help with more predictable tax levies.

1. Enterprise Fund
a. Deficit Position
The Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund has
operated at a deficit. For the past few  Enterprise Fund – return to sustainability
years, the City has used one-time and non-
recurring revenue as well as retained
earnings to fund the Fund’s operating and
capital budget. 
•  Bring capital funded positions into
operating budget
•  No new debt service for FY2023
•  Budget full repayment of deficit
MassDOR has allowed to City to amortize
its FY2020 deficit of $1.3M over 3 years 
•  Eliminate reliance on non-recurring
revenue
beginning in FY2022. However, because
the Enterprise Fund is still showing a
deficit and the deficit increased in FY2021, MassDOR will not allow the amortization in
FY2023. The budget for the Enterprise Fund includes a full repayment of the deficit as
of the end of FY2021 totaling $3.3M. A continuing revenue to expenditure gap was
anticipated in FY2022, which was bridged with one-time ARPA funding totaling $6.35M, 
bringing the total anticipated revenue shortfall for FY2023 at $10M. Beginning in
FY2023, the City must operate the Enterprise Fund at a surplus and recover the retained
earnings deficit through water and sewer rates. Otherwise, MassDOR will require that
the City raise the deficit from the Tax Levy. To that end, the draft Enterprise Fund
expenditures budget will be level funded - including assuming no increase in debt
service for FY2023 - with two exceptions. First the Enterprise Fund budget will reflect
the transfer of positions that are currently funded through capital projects into the
operating budget. These positions are currently being funded through debt rather than
the tax levy, a practice that the City should consider ending. The second exception is
the full repayment of the deficit. If rates are raised to match the expenditures budget, 
the City should be able to bring the Enterprise Fund out of deficit and have sufficient
room for gradual increases in rates in coming years. The required rate increase will also
depend on the FY2022 realized revenue, which is still being projected. 
b. Looking ahead: Projected rates and a revenue model for the Enterprise Fund will be
reviewed at a public meeting on May 19 and a public hearing in June.

service is dropping in FY2023 but will
increase again when projects that were
appropriated but have not been completed are bonded. There are 16 open projects in
the Sewer and Water Enterprise Fund totaling $16.5 million. The FY2023 capital
recommendation for Sewer and Water is similar to Public Works, with FY2023 as a year
with fewer appropriations to allow projects already appropriated to be completed, 
while maintaining the Sewer and Water infrastructure. Sewer infrastructure projects
include sewer improvements at Cedar Street for $110,000, Sewer Pump Station
Rehabilitation at Gates Street and Garvey Street totaling $1.4 million, various sewer
system improvements and repairs throughout the City totaling $803,000, sewer pump
station equipment replacement and a sanitary sewer evaluation study report for
$500,000. The water infrastructure projects recommended for funding in FY2023
include the Cedar Street area water improvements for $1,765,500, Merriam Hill and
Goodnow Water tank rehabilitation for $400,000 and fire flow restoration and
improvement for $800,000. 
The expense budgets include a line for indirect costs, which are costs budgeted within
the General Fund but covered by the Enterprise Fund. The indirect cost calculation is
currently being reviewed to determine the exact amount of General Fund expenses to
be allocated to the Enterprise Fund.
