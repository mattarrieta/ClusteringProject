West Ada School District Opt-Out Form for Mask Requirement
West Ada School District administration, in conjunction with the Board of
Trustees, decided during the Board meeting on August 24 that all students and
staff are required to wear masks/face coverings properly (covering mouth and
nose) while they are in the classroom and are unable to social distance until
further notice. This policy will be revisited as needed. 
The West Ada School District and the Board of Trustees recognize that parents
have a choice when it comes to the health of their child. If you prefer for your
student to not wear a mask, a legal parent/guardian must sign and return the 
opt-out form in person to your student's school. 
Please bring photo identification. 
Please note that the opt-out does not apply to students on the school bus, as the
Centers for Disease Control has issued a public health order requiring masks to
be
worn while on public transportation, this includes school buses. We must comply
with a public health order. 
The West Ada School District reserves the right to terminate the opt-out option
(medical exemptions will still apply) based on school-based health trends. 
Please return one opt-out form for each child.
