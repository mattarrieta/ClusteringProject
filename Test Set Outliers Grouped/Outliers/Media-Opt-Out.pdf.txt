MEDIA OPT-OUT FORM
September 1, 2021 through July 31, 2022
By completing and returning this form, I am indicating that I DO NOT want photographs or video, 
where my child is easily identifiable, to be intentionally used in The Pathway School publications/ 
communications, external communications/media formats and/or on The Pathway School website. 
Please list any child/children attending Pathway whom you DO NOT grant photo/video permission
below: 
Child’s name ______________________________________________________________________
Child’s name ______________________________________________________________________
Child’s name ______________________________________________________________________
Child’s name ______________________________________________________________________
Parent/guardian name: ______________________________________  Date:_____________
Parent/guardian signature: ___________________________________________________________
Forms not returned will allow assumed permission for child photo/video use. 
Parents/guardians may complete an Opt-out form at any point. In such cases, photos taken 
after the date form is received will not be used. Please note, photos taken prior to the 
date the opt-out form was returned have ‘grandfathered’ permission for use. 
Please be advised that signing this form prevents intentional use of your child’s photo or videotape
footage; however, in situations in which large groups are participating, it may not be possible to
prevent photography/videography of specific students and therefore, we may not be able to prevent
this use of photos/video footage that unintentionally includes an easily identifiable image of the child.
