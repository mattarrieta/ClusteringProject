Houston Fire Chief Screening Committee
Efforts to date
I. Background/research
  Extensive review of Tri-Data study
  Discussions:
-  Community – approximately 10 (including, NAACP, LULAC, President of
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Red-Ribbon Committee members)
-  HFD – approximately 25 (including, HFD management, union leaders, and rank
and file)
-  Office of the Mayor – Labor Division Chief
-  Tri-Data – study’s director
II. Screening Committee Meeting 1 – Information Session (4 ½ hour meeting)
  Presentation by Troy Blakeney – explanation of HFD organizational structure and
governing laws
  Presentation by Dr. Persse – explanation of EMS, its role and importance within the
HFD, and significant issues
  Slide presentation provided by Lisa Connolly – highlight of Tri-Data Study findings
and summary of HFD issues, as communicated by various individuals/groups during
background/research effort
  Separate discussions with HFD members on significant issues – 4 members of the
HFD participated, representing a matrix of HFD members including, women, 
Hispanics, Blacks, firefighters & paramedics
  Committee member discussion of target criteria for next Houston Fire Chief
III. Recruiting Effort
  Advertisements:
-  Fire Chief magazine and web page
-  International Fire Chiefs Association “On Scene” magazine and web page
-  Bulletin to all HFD personnel
  Cold Calls:
-  Targeted Fire Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs in the top 25-30 cities (based on
population) in the country
-  Targeted Fire Chiefs and Assistant Chiefs in cities of close proximity to Texas
More often than not, these calls led to recommendations of individuals that
should be pursued.
  Internet Search
-  Identified decorated fire chiefs, for example, Fire Chiefs of the Year (1998-2000),
Battalion Chiefs of the Year (1998-2000) and recipients of various awards of
excellence
-  Identified industry leaders based on participation on various fire-related boards
and committees, for example, International Association of Fire Chiefs Leadership

Directory which listed Metro Fire Chief Leaders (requirement of Metro Chief is
that must manage a minimum of 400 personnel) and EMS Leaders
  Executive Recruiters
-  Utilized assistance of 3 Executive Recruiters, one of which contains a Municipal
Employment Division, efforts included targeting recommendations/input from
administration at top Fire Schools and top Fire Commissioners in the country
IV. Candidate list
General consensus was that Prime candidates would not consider the position due to a
lack of job security/commitment from the City (i.e., contract) given the combination of
deep rooted problems at HFD (which most believed they would need a minimum of 2
years to make a noticeable difference) and the Houston political environment (election
year and City Council-Mayor relationship).
Results:
-  Executive Search firms (3) – 13 strong candidates identified, all but two of which
dropped-out or expressed no interest in the opportunity due to lack of contract
-  City of Houston Executive Recruiter – 22 strong candidates (over 50 resumes
were submitted) – my internet search efforts (in excess of 35 strong candidates
identified) were utilized here
-  A number of individuals were identified by Tri-Data study director – no results
from here, largely due to lack of contract
V. Screening Committee Meeting 2 – Review of Candidate List (3 hour meeting)
  Resumes from 24 Candidates were reviewed
  Total of 12 candidates chosen for interviews – 2 dropped-out stating similar reasons, 
lack of contract
VI. Screening Committee Meeting 3 – Interview of top 10 (7 hour meeting)
