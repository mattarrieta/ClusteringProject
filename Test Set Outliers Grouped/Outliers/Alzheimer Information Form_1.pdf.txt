Alzheimer's Information
The Framingham Police Department recognizes that people afflicted with Alzheimer's represent a unique
segment of our population who are susceptible to increased risk. Unfortunately when someone with
Alzheimer's is missing from their home/care facility, they may not possess the faculty to return or seek
assistance. 
The prompt recovery of missing persons with Alzheimer's is absolutely critical in increasing their chances of
survival. The ability to quickly disseminate photographs and biographical information will assist our officers
when attempting to locate and identify them. 
Please fill out the information requested on this form and submit it to the department. If you have a picture of
the person you may attach it. If you do not have a picture please contact a member of our Print and
Photography Bureau at 508-872-1212 ext 235 to make arrangements to have a photograph taken.
