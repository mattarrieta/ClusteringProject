Introduction
Application for Withdrawal of Accumulated Total Deductions
Form Last Revised: ,WPG 
The Application for Withdrawal of Total Accumulated Deductions allows an eligible member to
receive a refund of the total accumulated deductions in his or her annuity savings (retirement) 
account. An eligible member is one who:
has terminated his or her employment with a governmental unit; 
is not receiving workers’ compensation;
is not seeking to be restored to his or her position; and
is not accepting a position in the service of the Commonwealth or one of 
its political subdivisions. 
Members are strongly advised to review the following:
If you have over ten years of creditable service, you may currently be or 
might become eligible for a retirement allowance. By taking a withdrawal 
of your accumulated total deductions, you will lose any right to this 
retirement allowance. Before proceeding with a withdrawal, you should 
ask your retirement board for a personalized estimate of any benefits that 
you will forego by withdrawing.
Taking a refund of your total accumulated deductions terminates your 
rights in the retirement system and may subject you to tax consequences. 
For distributions made after January 1, 2002, please be aware that your 
options of an eligible retirement plan for transferring your deductions have 
been expanded dramatically. Please carefully review the “Special Tax 
Notice” that accompanies this application. If you have unresolved 
concerns, you may wish to consult with an attorney or a tax professional.
The amount of interest that members receive will vary, depending upon the years of 
creditable service and the nature of the separation from employment.
Your employer must certify the termination of your employment, that you owe no
obligation to the employer under an employee benefit plan, and sign this application.
Your retirement board will determine if you are eligible for a refund of your 
total accumulated deductions.
