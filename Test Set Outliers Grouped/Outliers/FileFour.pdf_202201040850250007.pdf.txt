TAXPAYER INFORMATION ABOUT ABATEMENT PROCEDURE
REASONS FOR AN ABATEMENT. An abatement is a reduction in the tax assessed on your property for the fiscal year. To dispute your valuation or
assessment or to correct any other billing problem or error that caused your tax bill to be higher than it should be, you must apply for an abatement. 
You may apply for an abatement if your property is: 1) overvalued (assessed value is more than fair cash value on January 1 for any reason, including
clerical and data processing errors or assessment of property that is non-existent or not taxable to you), 2) disproportionately assessed in comparison
with other properties, 3) classified incorrectly as residential, open space, commercial or industrial real property, or 4) partially or fully exempt. 
WHO MAY FILE AN APPLICATION. You may file an application if you are: 
•  the assessed or subsequent (acquiring title after January 1) owner of the property, 
•  the personal representative of the assessed owner's estate or personal representative or trustee under the assessed owner's will, 
•  a tenant paying rent who is obligated to pay more than one-half of the tax, 
•  a person owning or having an interest or possession of the property, or
•  a mortgagee if the assessed owner has not applied. 
In some cases, you must pay all or a portion of the tax before you can file. 
WHEN AND WHERE APPLICATION MUST BE FILED. Your application must be filed with the assessors on or before the date the first installment
payment of the actual tax bill mailed for the fiscal year is due, unless you are a mortgagee. If so, your application must be filed during the last 10 days of
the abatement application period. Actual tax bills are those issued after the tax rate is set. Applications filed for omitted, revised or reassessed taxes
must be filed within 3 months of the date the bill for those taxes was mailed. THESE DEADLINES CANNOT BE EXTENDED OR WAIVED BY THE
ASSESSORS FOR ANY REASON. IF YOUR APPLICATION IS NOT TIMELY FILED, YOU LOSE ALL RIGHTS TO AN ABATEMENT AND THE
ASSESSORS CANNOT BY LAW GRANT YOU ONE. TO BE TIMELY FILED, YOUR APPLICATION MUST BE (1) RECEIVED BY THE ASSESSORS ON
OR BEFORE THE FILING DEADLINE OR (2) MAILED BY UNITED STATES MAIL, FIRST CLASS POSTAGE PREPAID, TO THE PROPER ADDRESS
OF THE ASSESSORS ON OR BEFORE THE FILING DEADLINE AS SHOWN BY A POSTMARK MADE BY THE UNITED S"PATES POSTAL SERVICE. 
PAYMENT OF TAX. Filing an application does not stay the collection of your taxes. In some cases, you must pay all preliminary and actual
installments of the tax when due to appeal the assessors' disposition of your application. Failure to pay the tax assessed when due may also subject you
to interest charges and collection action. To avoid any loss of rights or additional charges, you should pay the tax as assessed. If an abatement is
granted and you have already paid the entire year's tax as abated, you will receive a refund of any overpayment. 
ASSESSORS DISPOSITION. Upon applying for an abatement, you may be asked to provide the assessors with written information about the property
and permit them to inspect it. Failure to provide the information or permit an inspection within 30 days of the request may result in the loss of your
appeal rights. 
The assessors have 3 months from the date your application is filed to act on it unless you agree in writing before that period expires to extend it for a
specific time. If the assessors do not act on your application within the original or extended period, it is deemed denied. You will be notified in writing
whether an abatement has been granted or denied. 
APPEAL. You may appeal the disposition of your application to the Appellate Tax Board, or if applicable, the County Commissioners. The appeal
must be filed within 3 months of the date the assessors acted on your application, or the date your application was deemed denied, whichever is
applicable. The disposition notice will provide you with further information about the appeal procedure and deadline.

Board of Assessors
Elizabeth Fekete, Chair

Matt Calder, Member 
FY2022, CY2020
Dear Property Owner: 
The Board of Assessors is requesting INCOME AND EXPENSE information on COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL and
APARTMENT (residential) properties to help us determine equitable values for assessment purposes. This request is for income and
expense information relative to the operation of real estate and not the business use within the real estate. 
When determining income producing property values, the Board must weigh financial as well as physical attributes. By completing
and returning the enclosed form, you help ensure the development of a sound basis to estimate the income approach to value. Please
be aware that this information will be used only to determine `market' income and expense levels for commercial and industrial
properties and apartments. In accordance with State Law, all information listed on the forms is not available to the public for
inspection. [CH 59 S52B] 
While it is in the best interest of property owners to contribute to the establishment of fair assessments, Massachusetts Law also
requires such disclosure: Section 38D of Chapter 59
Written Return of Information to Determine Valuation of Real Property
A board of assessors may request the owner or lessee of any real property to make a written return under oath within sixty days
containing such information as may reasonably be required by it to determine the actual fair cash valuation of such property. 
Failure of an owner or lessee of real property to comply with such request within 60 days after it has been made by the board of
assessors shall be automatic grounds for dismissal of a filing at the appellate tax board. The appellate tax board and the county
commissioners shall not grant extensions for the purposes of extending the filing requirements unless the applicant was unable to
comply with such request for reasons beyond his control or unless he attempted to comply in good faith. If any owner or lessee of real
property in a return made under this section makes any statement which he knows to be false in a material particular, such false
statement shall bar him from any statutory appeal under this chapter. 
If an owner or lessee of Class one, residential (e.g. apartment) property fails to submit the information within the time and in the form prescribed, 
the owner may be assessed an additional penalty for the next ensuing tax year in the amount of $50 but only if the board of assessors informed the
owner or lessee that failure to submit such information would result in the penalty. 
If an owner or lessee of Class three, commercial or Class four, industrial property fails to submit the information within the time and in the form
prescribed, the owner or lessee may be assessed an additional penalty for the next ensuing tax year in the amount of $250 but only if the board of
assessors informed the owner or lessee that failure to so submit such information would result in the penalty. 
Please note: Massachusetts General Law provides that failure to respond timely and accurately to this information request within sixty
(60) days of the postmarked date shall cause you to lose your right to appeal your assessment. 
All information provided is confidential and protected from public disclosure
The Board of Assessors thanks you for cooperation.
