Neonatal microbiome initialization and maturation have
been a major focus of recent microbiome research. Peri-
natal influence factors, in particular the birth type by vag-
inal birth or Cesarean section, have been identified as a
critical determinant of early-life microbiota composition
and development. Different therapeutic approaches have
been proposed and tested for neonatal microbiome res-
toration in C-section infants, which have received wide-
spread scientific, clinical and public attention. To provide
an overview and broader context of the current state of
the scientific discourse, Microbiome asked several experts
in the field to present their perspectives on neonatal
microbiota establishment and maturation, the impact of
C-sections, and the potential for early-life microbiome
restoration. In an accompanying editorial, we also outline
key questions and knowledge gaps around this topic [1].

A neonatal microbiome of opportunity?
Mathias W. Hornef and Niels van Best
After birth more than during any later time in life, the
microbiome undergoes dramatic changes with rapidly
rising bacterial density, major initial compositional fluc-
tuations, the stepwise emergence of organ- and site-
specific communities and a steady increase in bacterial
diversity. The observed rapid rise in bacterial density at
some anatomical sites is stunning and challenges our
textbook knowledge on tissue homeostasis in the pres-
ence of microbial immune stimuli [2].  It may help to
explain differences in the type and degree of the neo-
nate’s innate immune response to infection [3]. It may
also contribute to the etiology of necrotizing enterocolitis
(NEC), a dysregulated proinflammatory response of the
immature gut tissue of preterm neonates, illustrating the
tightly intertwined relationship between tissue and cell
development and host-microbial interaction.
The compositional fluctuations during the postnatal
period most likely reflect the influence of endogenous
or exogenous mechanisms on early bacterial colonizers, 
so-called pioneer bacteria [4–6].  Beside host-mediated
selection, priority effects also appear to contribute to the
early-life assembly of a stable gut microbial ecosystem
[7–9]. The influence of specific bacterial species on the
overall microbiome composition may therefore depend
on the order and timing in which they arrive. Clearly, 
the mother represents a major source for the establish-
ment of the microbiome consistent with the idea of
the transgenerational transmission of an evolutionary
optimized and beneficial assembly of microorganisms. 
Despite early reports on the role of the mother’s vaginal
bacteria, the infant gut microbiota originates from the

mother’s fecal microbiota most likely transmitted by the
intense contact during the birth process [10, 11]. This
early transmission event during vaginal delivery appears
to be of key importance. A number of studies have shown
that birth by C-section is associated with an increased
colonization rate by opportunistic pathogens [12] as
well as several immune-mediated diseases including
inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, and juvenile arthri-
tis [13, 14]. In addition, children delivered by primary
c-section exhibit a higher risk of developing food allergy
in later life [15]. This effect is independent of the perio-
perative antibiotic prophylaxis and thus most likely the
result of an impaired bacterial transmission and altered
immune imprinting [14–16]. Other factors such as diet
(i.e. breastfeeding vs. formula feeding), siblings, pets and
the natural environment also contribute in shaping the
infant’s microbiota and immune system but the identifi-
cation of their individual contribution is challenging due
to the presence of many confounders.
Another finding highlights the non-redundant role of
the birth process as an early transmission event. In the
adult host, different anatomical locations such as skin, 
gut or oral cavity are colonized by highly organ- and even
site-specific communities. However, this anatomical spe-
cialization is not detected directly after birth but emerges
only with time [5, 17]. This finding suggests the existence
of organ-specific selective mechanisms, which remain
largely uncharacterized. For example, our group showed
that the microbiome composition was highly similar
between the colon and small intestine early after birth
but diverged into a site-specific microbiota after weaning. 
This anatomical specialization was paralleled by hepatic
secretion of bile acids into the small intestinal lumen, a
potential driver of microbiota selection [5]. Other poten-
tial drivers of the early small intestinal microbiome might
represent the age-dependent switch in the spectrum of
antimicrobial peptides or the Toll-like receptor (TLR)5-
mediated suppression of colonization by flagellated bac-
teria [6, 18].
The initially reduced bacterial diversity opens ecologi-
cal niches both for commensal and pathogenic bacte-
ria and thereby explains the enhanced susceptibility of
neonates to infection [19]. Most likely, it also explains
why probiotic bacteria in early life exhibit at least some
degree of colonization and exert much more pronounced
effects than in adults [20]. The prolonged persistence of
certain probiotic strains, especially bifidobacteria, exerts
beneficial effects in neonates by increasing the coloniza-
tion resistance and promoting a more stable microbial
composition that protects against pathobiont-induced
diseases such as NEC. In addition, the initially reduced
bacterial diversity may render the neonate’s microbiota 
particularly susceptible to exogenous factors such as
early life antibiotics and diet [21, 22].
The bacterial composition during early life appears to
be of particular importance since specific microbial sig-
nals and metabolic factors influence the immune prim-
ing in a non-redundant fashion. Immune priming in
turn determines the life-long susceptibility to immune-
mediated and metabolic diseases [23–25]. Also host fac-
tors orchestrate the exposure of immune cells to luminal
microbial stimuli and antigens. For instance, the decreas-
ing epidermal growth factor (EGF) levels in breast milk
around weaning foster mucosal translocation of micro-
bial stimuli during the so-called ‘weaning reaction’ and
induce enhanced expression of interferon (IFN)-ɣ and
tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-ɑ and the generation of
specific regulatory T cells [26]. This induction of specific
regulatory T cells during the weaning reaction protects
from inflammatory diseases in adults and represents
an intriguing example of the combined influence of the
microbiota, diet, and ontogeny in priming of the immune
system and lifelong gut homeostasis.
Given the accessibility and functional importance, it
is tempting to manipulate the early microbiota, i.e. by
the administration of selected probiotics, prebiotics and
postbiotics (bacterial metabolites) in order to improve
the health outcome [20, 27, 28]. In addition, some efforts
have been made in which neonates born by C-section
were directly exposed to the maternal fecal microbiota
upon delivery via fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) 
to foster the maternal-neonatal microbiome transfer. 
However, our mechanistic understanding of the host
regulatory effects, bacterial interactions, metabolic fac-
tors and influence of the microbiome on the neonate host
are still incomplete. More mechanistic studies are needed
to identify microbial or metabolic targets, establish inter-
ventional strategies, characterize possible adverse effects
and define the patient groups that benefit most from safe
and effective targeted interventions.
Influence of the prenatal maternal microbiome
on neonatal health?
Eldin Jašarević
For more than a century, epidemiological studies dem-
onstrated that maternal lifetime experiences, namely
psychosocial stress, malnutrition, and infectious burden, 
predict poorer long-term outcomes across a variety of
domains [29]. Offspring outcomes associated with these
maternal exposures include higher risk for type 2 diabe-
tes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancers, as well as
neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders [30, 
31]. Disruption to the assembly and development of the
neonatal microbiome is associated with similar nega-
tive health outcomes, catalyzing a rich body of literature

examining the links between maternal lifetime expo-
sures, the maternal and offspring microbiome, and last-
ing health trajectories [32–45].
A conceptual framework emerging from these stud-
ies suggests that environmental exposure during preg-
nancy alters maternal microbiota and these communities
are subsequently transferred to offspring, influencing
susceptibility to disease. One challenge in establishing
causality between maternal exposures, microbiota, and
offspring phenotype is that these environmental per-
turbations exert disruptive effects on both mother and
developing fetus. In other words, offspring develop in a
prenatal environment that is shaped by lifetime expo-
sures to environmental conditions, and at birth, neonates
are colonized by microbiota shaped by the same factors. 
Innovative approaches and methods are now needed to
disentangle the complex interactions between lifetime
exposures, the disruption of pregnancy, and coloniza-
tion at birth. One such effort involved exposing fetal
mice to prenatal stress, followed by C-section delivery
and inoculation with distinct microbial communities
[46]. In these studies, transplantation of microbiota from
stressed dams into treatment naïve C-section delivered
pups was sufficient to recapitulate phenotypes observed
in stress-exposed offspring, establishing a mechanistic
link between maternal microbiota and negative health
outcomes in offspring [46].
A central argument in the debate regarding the safety
and efficacy of vaginal seeding and fecal microbiota trans-
plantation procedures hinges on whether birth-associ-
ated microbial exposure has any lasting health benefits, 
such that a lack of exposure prevents the initiation of a
developmentally-important event [27, 28, 47, 48]. Recent
strain-resolved microbiome analyses showed that mater-
nal vaginal bacteria –Lactobacillus crispatus, Atopobium
vaginae,  Gardnerella vaginalis– are recovered from
the stool of newborns, providing support for neonatal
inheritance of maternal vaginal microbiota [49]. These
bacteria are members of distinct community state types
(CSTs) [50–52]. Specifically, CST I (L. crispatus) and CST
IV (G. vaginalis, A. vaginae) exhibit distinct metabolic
and immune properties in the female reproductive tract
[53–56],  suggesting that CST-specific properties could
be transferred to offspring. We used our C-section and
oral gavage protocol to inoculate mouse pups with either
CST I or CST IV and assessed outcomes across develop-
ment and into adulthood. Birth-associated exposure to
CST I and CST IV resulted in transient colonization of
the intestinal tract in C-section delivered mice and was
sufficient to elicit CST-specific transcriptional signatures
in the neonatal ileum, as well as sex-specific differences
in adulthood [57]. Epidemiological studies demonstrated
that maternal obesity and presence of vaginal G. vaginalis 
are two common risk factors associated with increased
risk for adverse obstetric outcomes [58–63]. We estab-
lished a two-hit model to determine whether mater-
nal obesity and presence of vaginal G. vaginalis, alone
or in combination, would affect the offspring postnatal
response to CST I or CST IV exposure at birth [57]. Sur-
prisingly, neonates that gestated in a two-hit environment
showed a pathological immune response and decreased
survival following exposure to CST IV, a pattern that was
not observed in CST I exposed offspring. This pathologi-
cal response to the postnatal microbiota was associated
with disruption to the development of the placenta and
fetal ileum in the two-hit neonates [57]. If these results
bear any translational relevance, they underscore that
prenatal exposures directly shape how offspring respond
to their postnatal microbial environment and that one
unforeseen consequence of high-risk pregnancies may be
a pathological response to the colonizing microbiota and
increased neonatal morbidity.
While this area of research will undoubtedly contribute
significant insight into postnatal microbiota transplanta-
tion procedures and effects on health, this topic has also
garnered a growing fascination in public discourse over
the last several years. Reflecting a trickle-down effect
on social attitudes, a recent study examining attitudes
towards vaginal seeding reported that pregnant individu-
als viewed these procedures as replicating a natural pro-
cess and may help reduce maternal shame and guilt about
undergoing c-section [64]. This self-reported shame and
guilt about undergoing a lifesaving procedure reflects
a long cultural history of blaming mothers for negative
outcomes in their children, particularly mothers from
historically oppressed groups [65].  Moving forward, 
we must take great care in anticipating how research
describing cesarean delivery as a ‘missed opportunity’ 
that can be ‘recovered’, ‘naturalized,’ ‘restored,’ and ‘recon-
stituted’ by vaginal seeding and fecal microbiota trans-
plantation will be interpreted in popular discussions, 
and how the resultant discourse may inform policies on
bodily autonomy and reproductive health in our current
sociopolitical climate.
Should we vaginally seed the neonatal microbiome
after C‑section?
Maria Gloria Dominguez‑Bello
C-section delivery impairs the intergenerational transfer
of the maternal microbiome, altering natural colonization
by pioneer communities of different infant epithelia in
different body sites. C-section and pre or perinatal anti-
biotics are associated with increased risk of autoimmune
and metabolic diseases in humans and in mice. Thus, as
we perform medical practices that have collateral costs, 
we need to restore and minimize the damage.

I want to share three ideas regarding neonatal micro-
biota seeding at birth:
1-Nature design for fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and
mammals- entitles the offspring being born through
a canal that is i) colonized by microbes and ii) shared
with the defecation canal (cloaca) or adjacent to it
(vagina).  This non-random design favors transmis-
sion of maternal gut bacteria which will successfully
colonize the offspring’s gut. Thus, it is not surprising
that fecal transplant to newborns is effective in colo-
nizing the infant gut [28].
2-In humans, the vaginal canal in the late third gesta-
tional trimester does contain bacteria shared with
feces, and furthermore, shared also with oral, nose
and skin sites [48]. This extraordinary opening of the
vaginal ecosystem to colonization by bacteria from
other sites is consistent with the provision of pio-
neer communities for all of the baby’s sites. Vaginal
seeding of C-section babies normalizes the microbi-
ome development in the infant gut, skin and mouth, 
making them resemble more those of vaginally born
infants, than those of C-section born infants.
3-Given the serious consequences for the baby of
impaired microbiota transmission at birth, restora-
tion needs to be implemented with current state of
the art, minimizing both infection risks for the baby
and the costs of inaction. Why use “the real stuff”,
and not wait until we understand better which are
the exact bacteria and when to give them? Because
of the complexity of biological fluids (we are still per-
forming blood transfusions because we don’t know
yet how to reconstitute blood from purified compo-
nents).
Recapitulating natural exposures at birth after careful
examination of the maternal vaginal health will not put
the baby at higher risk of infections than vaginally born
infants. In the crucial windows of infancy, correct pro-
gramming will determine future health, and thus impacts
and perturbations cannot be followed by inaction, but
by rehabilitation to provide what was missing to restore
organisms and ecosystem functions that are crucial for
health.
Should we restore the neonatal microbiome
after C‑section with fecal microbiota
transplantation or probiotics?
Katri Korpela
The gut microbiota is being increasingly recognized as
an important part of human physiology and a significant
contributor to health. This is especially true in infants, 
where the gut microbiota influences the developing 
immune system and overall physiology. Gut microbi-
ota composition in infancy is associated with a range of
health outcomes in later childhood, most prominently
weight and immune health [66–72]. Factors known to
disrupt normal gut microbiota development in infants
– C-section birth, antibiotics, and lack of breastfeeding
– are also associated with weight and immune develop-
ment [14, 73–78]. The links between early-life antibiotic
use with asthma and overweight have been shown to be
mediated by gut microbiota [75, 79]. Furthermore, mouse
experiments have shown that altering the gut microbiota
at a young age alters metabolic and immunological devel-
opment [80–83]. We have shown in humans that cor-
recting aberrant gut microbiota development in infants
reduces the risk of allergic disease in a high-allergy-risk
cohort [84, 85], strongly indicating a causal role of gut
microbiota in disease development. Overall, there is evi-
dence that the gut microbiota plays a significant role in
infant development, and promoting a healthy gut micro-
biota is warranted.
The case for microbiota restoration is especially clear
for infants born by C-section. The important colonisers
of infant gut and primary utilisers of breast milk oligo-
saccharides, Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides strains, 
are naturally transferred from the mother’s gut during
birth [86]. They are non-spore-forming anaerobes, which
have a poor ability to survive in the environment and are
thus dependent on vertical transfer at birth. This transfer
is disrupted by C-section birth [86], leading to reduced
abundance and delayed colonisation of these important
bacteria in the infant gut [87]. Alarmingly, intrapartum
antibiotics administered to the mother have a similar
impact on the infant gut microbiota as C-section birth
[88, 89]. In addition, bifidobacteria are strongly negatively
affected by antibiotics given to the infant [90]. Infants
born by c-section, or exposed to intrapartum or postpar-
tum antibiotics would very likely benefit from microbiota
restoration.
Since the maternal gut is the natural source of microbes
to the infant gut, maternal fecal microbiota transfer
(FMT) is an effective method of microbiota restoration
in CS-born neonates [28]. Mimicking the natural verti-
cal transfer of microbiota at birth, FMT provides the
infant with a large diversity of maternal microbes, and
the ones adapted to the infant gut flourish and colonise
essentially permanently [86]. On the contrary, inocula-
tion of the infant with maternal vaginal microbes has
limited efficacy: Two studies have shown that while
swabbing the infant with vaginal microbes increases the
relative abundance of lactobacilli, it fails to restore Bac-
teroides and other fecal bacteria [47, 48]. In a re-analysis
of the data, we showed that the gut microbiota of vagi-
nally seeded infants resembles that of untreated CS-born
Page 5
van Best   et al. Microbiome (2022) 10:74  Page 5 of 9
infants, rather than that of vaginally born infants [28].
Oral administration of maternal vaginal microbes to CS-
born infants has been shown to produce no significant
differences in gut microbiota compared to no treatment
[91]. The vagina is a poor source of gut microbes [91, 92],
likely due to the highly selective vaginal environment
with a low pH that inhibits the growth of fecal microbes.
While maternal FMT is effective, it is unlikely to be
a feasible standard solution for all neonates. Careful
screening of the mother is required due to the poten-
tial of transmitting pathogens. Indeed, often the most
common reason for intrapartum antibiotic treatment is
maternal carriage of group B streptococcus, which can
cause a dangerous infection in the infant. Infants of these
mothers would benefit from microbiota restoration but
FMT may not be a safe option. FMT from a universal
donor could be a solution, and an intriguing question is
whether FMT from a universal donor is as effective as
maternal FMT. While there is some evidence to suggest
that strains from an infant’s own mother may be particu-
larly compatible with the infant’s gut [86], some mothers
may harbor a suboptimal microbiota e.g. due to antibi-
otic use or disease. Further research is needed on FMT
to infants.
Probiotics can be used to restore at least part of the
normal infant gut microbiota [85, 93, 94]. Products con-
taining infant gut-adapted bifidobacteria, such as Bifi-
dobacterium longum subsp. infantis,  B. breve,  and B. 
bifidum, are likely to be useful. Since many such strains
are currently on the market and safe, their use in C-sec-
tion-born and antibiotic-exposed infants is highly rec-
ommendable. Short-term administration of probiotics to
C-section-born neonates in the hospital appears promis-
ing [95] and warrants further study. Further development
of probiotic products specifically for the neonate could
provide a practical and cost-effective solution of micro-
biota restoration. However, it is possible that a small and
standardized set of strains is not effective in all individu-
als regarding all health outcomes. It should be noted
that restoration efforts are unlikely to be successful if the
infant is not breastfed, as human milk oligosaccharides
support the growth of the beneficial microbes.
The long-term health benefits of infant microbiota
restoration should be investigated especially in different
risk groups. Experimental restoration of gut microbiota
provides a way to test causality in the link between infant
gut microbiota and later health. Such long-term studies
will take time, but there is sufficient evidence to adopt
microbiota restoration practices before conclusive results
on health benefits are available. In addition to micro-
biota restoration, however, efforts are needed to reduce
microbiota disruption by promoting vaginal birth and 
breastfeeding, and carefully considering the need for rou-
tine prophylactic antibiotics during birth.
Maternal Microbiome Transmission as Inspiration
for Translational Research
Trevor D. Lawley
Maternal transmission of microbes to their neonates is an
unappreciated form of kinship involving microbes from
gut, urogenital, oral and skin microbiotas [96]. Common
maternally transmitted bacteria found in the gut micro-
biota of vaginally delivered babies who were breastfed
include Bacteroides species, Parabacteriodes species, 
Escherichia coli and Bifidobacteria species that are highly
adapted to co-colonize neonates as an ecosystem in sym-
biotic relationships that have co-evolved over many mil-
lennia [97]. After c-section birth, many of these bacterial
species do not transmit to neonates, possibly due to the
inhibitory effects of antibiotic exposure or competition
from opportunistic environmental pathogens [12]. There
is a need to develop a deep microbiological, evolutionary
and ecological understanding of maternal transmission
and its impact on microbiota acquisition and assembly
in neonates to identify pioneering and keystone bacterial
species and strains that provide beneficial properties.
The key challenge is to determine how these mater-
nally transmitted microbes influence the longer-term
growth, development and disease resistance of a baby
[23].  Much of our current understanding of maternal
transmission and early life microbiota assembly comes
from large birth cohorts that track the microbiome of
individual babies long-term while building a personalized
biobank of biological samples linked to various metadata
to enable large-scale, data-driven discovery [23, 98–101].
High-resolution metagenomics and anaerobic culturing
coupled to whole-genome phylogenetic analysis are the
most reliable approaches to identify maternal-neonate
transmission events at the species and strain levels [12, 
49, 102, 103]. However, the outputs of these studies are
primarily associations that link bacterial taxa to clini-
cal phenotypes, allowing for the generation of biological
hypotheses, but the mechanisms remain poorly under-
stood and unproven. There is a need to culture and
biobank pioneering and keystone microbial species from
neonates that potentially code for beneficial properties to
enable experimental testing and biological discovery.
As an example of maternally transmitted bacteria, 
species of Bifidobacterium (phylum Actinobacteria) are
highly adapted for maternal transmission and coloniza-
tion of the neonatal intestine [104], through both fae-
cal-oral and breastmilk-oral transmission [105]. There
are many Bifidobacterium species described, however, 
B. breve,  B. bifidum and B. longum are commonly
found in the neonatal gut microbiotas in the UK [12], 
Page 6
van Best et al. Microbiome (2022) 10:74  Page 6 of 9
Sweden, Russia and USA [99]. Importantly, B. longum 
subsp. infantis is not common in neonates born in any
of these Western world countries, but is the dominant
founder bacterium in neonates from Low- and Middle-
Income Countries Bangladesh [106], Gambia [107] and
Malawi [108]. It is possible that B. longum subsp. infan-
tis has been lost from Westernized human populations
due to modern lifestyles, such as diets, antibiotics, etc. 
Bifidobacteria play a pioneering role in nucleating and
shaping the gut microbiota assembly by supporting the
acquisition and colonisation of new beneficial microbes
through cooperation such as cross-feeding human milk
oligosaccharides (HMOs) [109],  or through the inhi-
bition of pathogen colonisation [110].  More recently, 
B. infantis has been shown to harbour highly evolved
pathways that metabolise breastmilk, releasing indole-
3-lactic acid to shape immune development [111].
There are likely numerous more human-adapted func-
tions and metabolites to be discovered from gut bacte-
rial species beyond Bifidobacteria that have co-evolved
to transmit from mother to child that could potentially
be exploited therapeutically.
We need to innovate ways to protect and nurture a
baby’s microbiota to optimize growth, development and
disease resistance. Understanding the ecological pro-
cesses and mechanisms of maternal transmission and
early life microbiota acquisition and assembly holds
the key to biological discovery to enable translational
sciences. We need to consider alternatives to antibiot-
ics that spare a baby’s microbiota, and also therapies
that can recover/restore the microbiota after antibiotic
therapy. Microbiota transplantation studies in neo-
nates using undefined maternal microbiomes have been
undertaken but longer-term we envision more sophisti-
cated, defined approaches [48, 91]. A deep understand-
ing of maternal transmission and neonate microbiome
assembly will guide the discovery and development of
a variety of novel products based on microbes or their
metabolites, such as Live Bacterial Products, ration-
ally designed prebiotics, small molecule bioactives and
targeted phage therapies. Breastmilk is rich in immu-
noglobulins, lactoferrin, cytokines and growth factors
and provides passive immunity to the infant while the
immune system is developing [112]. Breastmilk is also
enriched in Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) 
that serve as nutrients and energy for maternally
transmitted bacteria, and potentially inducers of ben-
eficial functions. We need to understand the interplay
between neonatal gut microbiome assembly and breast-
milk and will likely find bioactives derived from bacte-
ria, potentially induced by breastmilk, with activities
that act directly on human cells within the gut but also
at systemic sites impacting immunological, metabolic 
and cognitive development. We believe maternal trans-
mission is deeply evolved and there are opportunities
to consider maternal transmission in a global context, 
including maternal microbiota transmission as evo-
lutionarily conserved in humans but adapted to local
lifestyles and cultures, to establish and strengthen
Global Health and translational research on early life
microbiotas.
