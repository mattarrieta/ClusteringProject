Mudflat
Mudflats or mud flats, also known as tidal flats
 or, in Ireland, slob or slobs,[1][2] are coastal
wetlands that form in intertidal areas where
sediments have been deposited by tides or rivers.
A global analysis published in 2019 suggested
that tidal flat ecosystems are as extensive globally
as mangroves, covering at least 127,921 km2
(49,391 sq mi) of the Earth's surface.[3] They are
found in sheltered areas such as bays, bayous,
lagoons, and estuaries; they are also seen in
 freshwater [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake"] lakes and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_lake"] salty lakes (or inland seas)
alike, wherein many rivers and creeks end.[4]
Mudflats may be viewed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geology"] geologically as exposed
layers of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_mud"] bay mud, resulting from deposition of
 estuarine silts, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay"] clays and aquatic animal detritus.
Most of the sediment within a mudflat is within
the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertidal_zone"] intertidal zone, and thus the flat is submerged
and exposed approximately twice daily.

tripartition in supratidal, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertidal"] intertidal and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtidal"] subtidal zones.
The most apparent character of the area is the
development of tidal channels, affecting mainly the
 intertidal zone. In this case, the tidal flat is protected
A recent global remote sensing analysis estimated
that approximately 50% of the global extent of
tidal flats occurs within eight countries (Indonesia, 
seaward by a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoal"] beach barrier, but in many cases (low-
energy [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_waves"] waves and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longshore_currents"] longshore currents) the tidal flats
may directly pass into a shallow marine environment.
China, Australia, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"] United States, Canada, India,
Brazil, and Myanmar) and that 44% of the world's tidal flats occur within Asia (56,051 km2 or
21,641 sq mi).[3]
In the past tidal flats were considered unhealthy, economically unimportant areas and were often dredged
and developed into agricultural land.[5] Several especially shallow mudflat areas, such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadden_Sea"] Wadden Sea,
are now popular among those practising the sport of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudflat_hiking"] mudflat hiking.
On the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea"] Baltic Sea coast of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"] Germany in places, mudflats are exposed not by tidal action, but by wind-action
driving water away from the shallows into the sea. This kind of wind-affected mudflat is called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windwatt"] Windwatt in
German.

Tidal flats, along with intertidal [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_marsh"] salt marshes and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove"] mangrove forests,
are important ecosystems.[6] They usually support a large
population of wildlife, and are a key habitat that allows tens of
millions of migratory [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorebirds"] shorebirds to migrate from breeding sites in
the northern hemisphere to non-breeding areas in the southern
hemisphere. They are often of vital importance to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migratory_bird"] migratory birds,
as well as certain species of crabs,[7] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusk"] mollusks and fish.[8] In the
 United Kingdom mudflats have been classified as a Biodiversity
Action Plan priority habitat.

The maintenance of mudflats is important in preventing coastal Island, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand"] New Zealand
erosion. However, mudflats worldwide are under threat from
predicted [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise"] sea level rises, land claims for development, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dredge"] dredging due
to shipping purposes, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_contamination"] chemical pollution.[3] In some parts of the world, such as East and South-East
Asia, mudflats have been reclaimed for aquaculture, agriculture, and industrial development. For example,
around the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Sea"] Yellow Sea region of East Asia, more than 65% of mudflats present in the early 1950s had been
destroyed by the late 2000s.[9][10] It is estimated that up to 16% of the world tidal flats have disappeared
since the mid-1980s.[3]
Mudflat sediment deposits are focused into the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertidal_zone"] intertidal zone which is composed of a barren zone and
marshes. Within these areas are various ratios of sand and mud that make up the sedimentary layers.[11] The
associated growth of coastal sediment deposits can be attributed to rates of subsidence along with rates of
deposition (example: silt transported via river) and changes in sea level.[11]
Barren zones extend from the lowest portion of the intertidal zone to the marsh areas. Beginning in close
proximity to the tidal bars, sand dominated layers are prominent and become increasingly muddy
throughout the tidal channels. Common bedding types include laminated sand, ripple bedding, and bay
mud. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioturbation"] Bioturbation also has a strong presence in barren zones.
 Marshes contain an abundance of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbaceous_plant"] herbaceous plants while the sediment layers consist of thin sand and mud
layers. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudcrack"] Mudcracks are a common as well as wavy bedding planes.[11] Marshes are also the origins of
coal/peat layers because of the abundant decaying plant life.[11]
 Salt pans can be distinguished in that they contain thinly laminated layers of clayey silt. The main source of
the silt comes from rivers. Dried up mud along with wind erosion forms silt dunes. When flooding, rain or
tides come in, the dried sediment is then re-distributed.[11]
