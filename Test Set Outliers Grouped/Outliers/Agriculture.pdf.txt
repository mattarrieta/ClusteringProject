Agriculture
 Agriculture or farming is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock.[1] Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human
civilization, whereby farming of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication"] domesticated species created food [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_surplus"] surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_agriculture"] history of agriculture began
thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains beginning at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years
ago. Pigs, sheep, and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world.
 Industrial agriculture based on large-scale [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoculture"] monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion people
still depended on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsistence_agriculture"] subsistence agriculture.
The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material"] raw materials (such as rubber). Food classes include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal"] cereals
(grains), vegetables, fruits, oils, meat, milk, eggs, and fungi. Over one-third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the
 service sector, although in recent decades, the global trend of a decreasing number of agricultural workers continues, especially in developing
countries, where [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallholding"] smallholding is being overtaken by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_agriculture"] industrial agriculture and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanised_agriculture"] mechanization that brings an enormous [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop"] crop yield increase.
Modern agronomy, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_breeding"] plant breeding, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrochemical"] agrochemicals such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide"] pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop
yields, but cause [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_agriculture"] ecological and environmental damage. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_breeding"] Selective breeding and modern practices in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_husbandry"] animal husbandry have similarly increased the
 output of meat but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage. Environmental issues include contributions to global
warming, depletion of aquifers, deforestation, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_resistance"] antibiotic resistance, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_pollution"] other agricultural pollution. Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to
 environmental degradation, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss"] biodiversity loss, desertification, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_degradation"] soil degradation, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture"] global warming, all of which can cause decreases in crop
yield. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism"] Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some are banned in certain countries.

Etymology and scope
The word agriculture is a late [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English"] Middle English adaptation of Latin agricultūra, from ager 'field' and cultūra [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillage"] 'cultivation' or 'growing'.[2] While
agriculture usually refers to human activities, certain species of ant,[3][4] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termite"] termite and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrosia_beetle"] beetle have been cultivating crops for up to 60 million years.[5]
Agriculture is defined with varying scopes, in its broadest sense using natural resources to "produce commodities which maintain life, including food,
fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services".[6] Thus defined, it includes [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arable_farming"] arable farming, horticulture, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_husbandry"] animal husbandry and
forestry, but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded.[6]It may also be broadly decomposed into plant agriculture, which concerns
the cultivation of useful plants,[7] and animal agriculture, the production of agricultural animals.[8]
History
Origins
The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than
could be sustained by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer"] hunting and gathering.[11] Agriculture began independently in different
 parts of the globe,[12] and included a diverse range of taxa, in at least 11 separate centers of
origin.[9] Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago.[13] In the
Paleolithic levant, 23,000 years ago, cereals cultivation of emmer, barley, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oats"] oats has been
observed near the sea of Galilee. [14][15] Rice was [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_China"] domesticated in China between 11,500 and
6,200 BC with the earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC,[16] followed by mung, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soy"] soy and
 azuki beans. Sheep were domesticated in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia"] Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years
ago.[17] Cattle were domesticated from the wild [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurochs"] aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and
Pakistan some 10,500 years ago.[18] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_pig"] Pig production emerged in Eurasia, including Europe, East
Asia and Southwest Asia,[19] where [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_boar"] wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years
ago.[20] In the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andes"] Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 
 Centres of origin, as numbered by [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Vavilov"] Nikolai Vavilov
in the 1930s. Area 3 (gray) is no longer recognised
as a centre of origin, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea"] New Guinea (area P,

years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig"] guinea pigs. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarcane"] Sugarcane and some [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_root_vegetables"] root vegetables were domesticated in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea"] New Guinea around
9,000 years ago. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorghum"] Sorghum was domesticated in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahel"] Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru"] Peru by 5,600 years
ago,[21] and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Mesoamerica"] In Mesoamerica, wild [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teosinte"] teosinte was bred into maize by 6,000 years ago.[22]Scholars have
offered multiple hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer"] hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies
indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natufian_culture"] Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic
in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated.[23][24][25]
Civilizations
In Eurasia, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer"] Sumerians started to live in villages from about 8,000 BC, relying on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigris"] Tigris and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphrates"] Euphrates rivers and a canal system for irrigation.
Ploughs appear in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictograph"] pictographs around 3,000 BC; seed-ploughs around 2,300 BC. Farmers grew wheat, barley, vegetables such as lentils and onions,
and fruits including dates, grapes, and figs.[26] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_agriculture"] Ancient Egyptian agriculture relied on the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile_River"] Nile River and its seasonal flooding. Farming started in the
predynastic period at the end of the Paleolithic, after 10,000 BC. Staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley, alongside industrial crops
such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flax"] flax and papyrus.[27][28] In India, wheat, barley and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujube"] jujube were domesticated by 9,000 BC, soon followed by sheep and goats.[29] Cattle,
sheep and goats were domesticated in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehrgarh"] Mehrgarh culture by 8,000–6,000 BC.[30][31][32] Cotton was cultivated by the 5th–4th millennium BC.[33]
Archeological evidence indicates an animal-drawn [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plough"] plough from 2,500 BC in the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilisation"] Indus Valley Civilisation.[34]
In China, from the 5th century BC there was a nationwide [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granary"] granary system and widespread [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sericulture"] silk farming.[35] Water-powered grain mills were in use by
the 1st century BC,[36] followed by irrigation.[37] By the late 2nd century, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_plough"] heavy ploughs had been developed with iron ploughshares and
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock"] mouldboards.[38][39] These spread westwards across Eurasia.[40] Asian rice was domesticated 8,200–13,500 years ago – depending on the molecular
clock estimate that is used[41]– on the Pearl River in southern China with a single genetic origin from the wild rice [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryza_rufipogon"] Oryza rufipogon.[42] In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_ancient_Greece"] Greece
and Rome, the major cereals were wheat, emmer, and barley, alongside vegetables including peas, beans, and olives. Sheep and goats were kept
mainly for dairy products.[43][44]
In the Americas, crops domesticated in Mesoamerica (apart from teosinte) include squash, beans, and cacao.[45] Cocoa was being domesticated by
the Mayo Chinchipe of the upper Amazon around 3,000 BC.[46]The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_turkey"] turkey was probably domesticated in Mexico or the American Southwest.[47]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec"] Aztecs developed irrigation systems, formed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrace_(agriculture)"] terraced hillsides, fertilized their soil, and developed [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinampa"] chinampas or artificial islands. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization"] Mayas used
extensive canal and raised field systems to farm swampland from 400 BC.[48][49][50][51][52] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca"] Coca was domesticated in the Andes, as were the peanut,
tomato, tobacco, and pineapple.[45] Cotton was domesticated in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru"] Peru by 3,600 BC.[53] Animals including llamas, alpacas, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig"] guinea pigs were
domesticated there.[54] In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_agriculture_in_the_United_States"] North America, the indigenous people of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Agricultural_Complex"] East domesticated crops such as sunflower, tobacco,[55] squash and
 Chenopodium.[56][57] Wild foods including [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_rice"] wild rice and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_sugar"] maple sugar were harvested.[58] The domesticated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry"] strawberry is a hybrid of a Chilean and a
 North American species, developed by breeding in Europe and North America.[59] The indigenous people of the Southwest and the Pacific
Northwest practiced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_gardening"] forest gardening and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire-stick_farming"] fire-stick farming. The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_use_of_fire"] natives controlled fire on a regional scale to create a low-intensity [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_ecology"] fire ecology that
 sustained a low-density agriculture in loose rotation; a sort of "wild" permaculture.[60][61][62][63] A system of companion planting called the Three
Sisters was developed in North America. The three crops were [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_squash"] winter squash, maize, and climbing beans.[64][65]
 Indigenous Australians, long supposed to have been nomadic [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherers"] hunter-gatherers, practised systematic burning, possibly to enhance natural productivity
in fire-stick farming.[66] Scholars have pointed out that hunter-gatherers need a productive environment to support gathering without cultivation.
Because the forests of New Guinea have few food plants, early humans may have used "selective burning" to increase the productivity of the wild
 karuka fruit trees to support the hunter-gatherer way of life.[67]

The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunditjmara"] Gunditjmara and other groups developed eel farming and fish trapping systems from some 5,000 years ago.[68]
There is evidence of 'intensification' across the whole continent over that period.[69] In two regions of Australia, the
central west coast and eastern central, early farmers cultivated yams, native millet, and bush onions, possibly in
permanent settlements.[25][70]
Revolution
 In the Middle Ages, compared to the Roman period, agriculture in Western
Europe became more focused on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sustainability"] self-sufficiency. The agricultural population
under feudalism was typically organized into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manorialism"] manors consisting of several

was a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_Bowl"] Dust Bowl in the United States with tragic consequences.[78]
Types 
 Pastoralism involves managing domesticated animals. In nomadic
pastoralism, herds of livestock are moved from place to place in
search of pasture, fodder, and water. This type of farming is practised
in arid and semi-arid regions of Sahara, Central Asia and some parts
of India.[79]
 Reindeer herds form the basis of
pastoral agriculture for several Arctic
and Subarctic peoples. 
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shifting_cultivation"] shifting cultivation, a small area of forest is cleared by cutting and
burning the trees. The cleared land is used for growing crops for a
few years until the soil becomes too infertile, and the area is
abandoned. Another patch of land is selected and the process is
repeated. This type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with
abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly. This practice is
used in Northeast India, Southeast Asia, and the Amazon Basin.[80]
 Subsistence farming is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone, with little left over for transport
elsewhere. It is intensively practiced in Monsoon Asia and South-East Asia.[81] An estimated 2.5 billion
subsistence farmers worked in 2018, cultivating about 60% of the earth's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arable_land"] arable land.[82]
 Intensive farming is cultivation to maximise productivity, with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs
(water, fertilizer, pesticide and automation). It is practiced mainly in developed countries.[83][84]

Status
From the twentieth century, intensive agriculture increased productivity of crops. It substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labour, but
caused increased water pollution, and often involved farm subsidies. In recent years there has been a backlash against the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_awareness"] environmental effects of
conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic, regenerative, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_agriculture"] sustainable agriculture movements.[76][86] One of the major forces behind this
movement has been the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"] European Union, which first certified [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_food"] organic food in 1991 and began reform of its [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Agricultural_Policy"] Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in
2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm subsidies,[87] also known as decoupling. The growth of organic farming has renewed research in
alternative technologies such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_pest_management"] integrated pest management, selective breeding,[88] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-environment_agriculture"] controlled-environment agriculture.[89][90] Recent
mainstream technological developments include [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food"] genetically modified food.[91] Demand for non-food biofuel crops,[92] development of former farm
 lands, rising transportation costs, climate change, growing consumer demand in China and India, and population growth,[93] are threatening food
 security in many parts of the world.[94][95][96][97][98] The International Fund for Agricultural Development posits that an increase in smallholder
 agriculture may be part of the solution to concerns about food prices and overall food security, given the favorable experience of Vietnam.[99] Soil

 degradation and diseases such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_rust"] stem rust are major concerns globally;[100] approximately 40% of the
world's agricultural land is seriously degraded.[101][102] By 2015, the agricultural output of China was
the largest in the world, followed by the European Union, India and the United States.[85] Economists
measure the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_factor_productivity"] total factor productivity of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the United States
is roughly 1.7 times more productive than it was in 1948.[103]
Workforce
Following the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-sector_theory"] three-sector theory, the number of people employed in agriculture and other [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sector"] primary
activities (such as fishing) can be more than 80% in the least developed countries, and less than 2% in
the most highly developed countries.[104] Since the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution"] Industrial Revolution, many countries have made
the transition to developed economies, and the proportion of people working in agriculture has steadily
fallen. During the 16th century in Europe, for example, between 55 and 75% of the population was
engaged in agriculture; by the 19th century, this had dropped to between 35 and 65%.[105]
In the same countries today, the figure is less than 10%.[104]At the start of the 21st century,
some one billion people, or over 1/3 of the available work force, were employed in
agriculture. It constitutes approximately 70% of the global employment of children, and in
many countries employs the largest percentage of women of any industry.[106] The service
sector overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in 2007.[107] 
China has the largest agricultural output of
any country.[85]
Safety 
Agriculture, specifically farming, remains a
hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain
at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease,
 noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, as well as
certain cancers related to chemical use and
prolonged sun exposure. On [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_agriculture"] industrialized farms,
 injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural
machinery, and a common cause of fatal agricultural

 injuries in developed countries is tractor

workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects.[109] As an industry
in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families can be at risk for
injuries, illness, and death.[110] Ages 0–6 May be an especially vulnerable population in agriculture;[111] common causes of fatal injuries among
young farm workers include drowning, machinery and motor accidents, including with all-terrain vehicles.[110][111][112]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization"] International Labour Organization considers agriculture "one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors".[106] It estimates that the annual
work-related death toll among agricultural employees is at least 170,000, twice the average rate of other jobs. In addition, incidences of death, injury
 and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported.[113] The organization has developed the Safety and Health in Agriculture
Convention, 2001, which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation, the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and
organizations engaged in agriculture should play.[106]
In the United States, agriculture has been identified by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health"] National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as a priority industry sector in the
 National Occupational Research Agenda to identify and provide intervention strategies for occupational health and safety issues.[114][115]In the
European Union, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Agency_for_Safety_and_Health_at_Work"] European Agency for Safety and Health at Work has issued guidelines on implementing health and safety directives in
agriculture, livestock farming, horticulture, and forestry.[116] The Agricultural Safety and Health Council of America (ASHCA) also holds a yearly
summit to discuss safety.[117]

Crop cultivation systems 
Cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and
climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and
culture of the farmer.[119][120]
 Slash and burn shifting cultivation,
Thailand 
Shifting cultivation (or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_and_burn"] slash and burn) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support
cultivation of annual and then [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_plant"] perennial crops for a period of several years.[121] Then the plot is left fallow to
regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow
period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or manure) and
some manual [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_control"] pest control. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period.
This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.[121]
Further industrialization led to the use of monocultures, when one
 cultivar is planted on a large acreage. Because of the low biodiversity,
nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide"] pesticides and
fertilizers.[120] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_cropping"] Multiple cropping, in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and
intercropping, when several crops are grown at the same time, are other kinds of annual cropping systems
known as polycultures.[121]
In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtropics"] subtropical and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arid"] arid environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not
allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring irrigation. In all of these environments perennial crops
are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as agroforestry. In [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperateness"] temperate environments,
where ecosystems were predominantly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassland"] grassland or prairie, highly productive annual farming is the dominant
agricultural system.[121]

Livestock production systems
Animal husbandry is the breeding and raising of animals for meat, milk, eggs, or wool, and for work and
transport.[124] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_animal"] Working animals, including horses, mules, oxen, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_buffalo"] water buffalo, camels, llamas, alpacas,
donkeys, and dogs, have for centuries been used to help cultivate fields, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest"] harvest crops, wrangle other animals,
and transport farm products to buyers.[125]
Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as grassland-based, mixed, and
landless.[126] As of 2010, 30% of Earth's ice- and water-free area was used for producing livestock, with the
sector employing approximately 1.3 billion people. Between the 1960s and the 2000s, there was a significant
 Intensively farmed pigs  increase in livestock production, both by numbers and by carcass weight, especially among beef, pigs and
chickens, the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10. Non-meat animals, such as
milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. Global cattle, sheep
and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050.[127] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaculture"] Aquaculture or fish farming, the production of fish for human
consumption in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average of 9% a year between 1975 and
2007.[128]
During the second half of the 20th century, producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breed"] breeds and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbreed"] crossbreeds that increased
production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_diversity"] genetic diversity. This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and
resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional
breeds.[129]
Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland, rangeland, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managed_intensive_rotational_grazing"] pastures
for feeding [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant"] ruminant animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the
grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is
not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30–40 million pastoralists.[121] Mixed production systems
use grassland, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fodder"] fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric (one stomach; mainly
chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.[126]
Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock
production found more prevalently in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_for_Economic_Co-operation_and_Development"] Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member
countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure use becomes a
challenge as well as a source for pollution.[126] Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much

of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in
 confined animal feeding operations, sometimes called [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_farming"] factory farming. Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, with much
smaller amounts of growth in Africa.[127] Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_hormone"] growth hormones,
are controversial.[130]
Production practices 
Tillage is the practice of breaking up the soil with tools such as the plow or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_(tool)"] harrow to prepare for planting, for
nutrient incorporation, or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-till_farming"] no-till. It may
improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil
more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO2,  and reduces the
abundance and diversity of soil organisms.[131][132]
 Tilling an arable field 
Pest control includes the management of weeds, insects, mites, and diseases. Chemical (pesticides), biological
(biocontrol), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include crop rotation,
culling, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_crop"] cover crops, intercropping, composting, avoidance, and resistance. Integrated pest management
attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic
loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.[133]
 Nutrient management includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of use of manure produced by
livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, manure, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_manure"] green manure, compost and minerals.[134] Crop nutrient use may also be
managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallow"] fallow period. Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is
growing, such as in managed intensive rotational grazing, or [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manure_spreader"] by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or
pastures.[131][135]
 Water management is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most
 regions of the world.[121] Some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall. In other areas such as the Great
Plains in the U.S. and Canada, farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop
in the following year.[136] Agriculture represents 70% of freshwater use worldwide.[137]
According to a report by the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Food_Policy_Research_Institute"] International Food Policy Research Institute, agricultural technologies will have
the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other; using a model that assessed
how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, the
International Food Policy Research Institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be
reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.[138]  A [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_pivot_irrigation"] center pivot irrigation system
 Payment for ecosystem services is a method of providing additional incentives to encourage farmers to
conserve some aspects of the environment. Measures might include paying for reforestation upstream of a city, to improve the supply of fresh
water.[139]
Effects of climate change on yields
 Climate change and agriculture are interrelated on a global scale. [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture"] Global warming affects agriculture through
changes in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record"] average temperatures, rainfall, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather"] weather extremes (like storms and heat waves); changes in
pests and diseases; changes in atmospheric [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide"] carbon dioxide and ground-level [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozone"] ozone concentrations; changes in
the nutritional quality of some foods;[140] and changes in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_sea_level_rise"] sea level.[141] Global warming is already affecting
agriculture, with effects unevenly distributed across the world.[142] Future climate change will probably
negatively affect [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_yield"] crop production in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_latitude"] low latitude countries, while effects in northern [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude"] latitudes may be positive
or negative.[142] Global warming will probably increase the risk of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_insecurity"] food insecurity for some vulnerable
groups, such as the poor.[143]

Crop alteration and biotechnology
Plant breeding
Wheat cultivar tolerant of high
 salinity (left) compared with non-
tolerant variety 
Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization.
Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more
beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to
pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel"] Gregor Mendel. His work on
 dominant and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recessive_allele"] recessive alleles, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a
better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant
selection with desirable traits, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-pollination"] self-pollination and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-pollination"] cross-pollination, and molecular techniques that genetically
modify the organism.[144]
 Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved disease resistance and drought
tolerance, eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and
breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the
Page 8
1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in New Zealand. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive
genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.[145][146]
The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution"] Green Revolution popularized the use of conventional [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)"] hybridization to sharply increase yield by creating
"high-yielding varieties". For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the US have increased from around
2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001.
Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha
in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, and Egypt and Arabia
up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8
t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming
techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, growth control to avoid lodging).[147][148][149]
Genetic engineering 
Seedlings in a green house. This is
what it looks like when seedlings are
growing from plant breeding.
Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism"] organisms whose [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics"] genetic material has been altered by genetic
engineering techniques generally known as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA_technology"] recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has
expanded the genes available to breeders to use in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased
durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes
bred into crops through genetic engineering.[150] For some, GMO crops cause [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety"] food safety and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_labeling_regulations"] food labeling
concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and
crops.[151] Currently a global treaty, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosafety_Protocol"] Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing
discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO
foods to be labeled, the US does not.[152]
Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to
herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with

herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers
worldwide.[153] With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of
glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides.[154][155]
Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality
concern, with potential economic and health implications.[156]
Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_thuringiensis"] Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which
produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects.[157] Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired
through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species. In
some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so
through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes.[158]
Environmental impact
Effects and costs 
Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_degradation"] environmental degradation, such as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss"] biodiversity loss, desertification,
[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_degradation"] soil degradation and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change_on_agriculture"] global warming, which cause decrease in crop yield.[159] Agriculture is one of the most
important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic
emissions. Agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment, including insecticides, especially
those used on cotton.[160][161] The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report stated that agricultural operations produced
some 13 per cent of anthropogenic global greenhouse gas emissions. This includes gases from the use of inorganic
fertilizers, agro-chemical pesticides, and herbicides, as well as fossil fuel-energy inputs.[162]
 Water pollution in a rural
 stream due to runoff from
farming activity in New
Zealand 
Agriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as pesticide damage to nature
(especially herbicides and insecticides), nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, and loss of natural environment. A
2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per
hectare.[163] A 2005 analysis of these costs in the US concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to $16
billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock production imposes $714 million.[164] Both studies, which focused
solely on the fiscal impacts, concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs. Neither included
subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society.[163][164]
Agriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs. Yield increases with inputs such as fertilisers and removal of
pathogens, predators, and competitors (such as weeds). Costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units, such as
making fields larger; this means removing hedges, ditches and other areas of habitat. Pesticides kill insects, plants and fungi. These and other
measures have cut biodiversity to very low levels on intensively farmed land.[165] Effective yields fall with on-farm losses, which may be caused by
poor production practices during harvesting, handling, and storage.[166]
Livestock issues
Page 9
A senior UN official, Henning Steinfeld, said that "Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to
today's most serious environmental problems".[167] Livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for
agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the planet. It is one of the largest sources of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas"] greenhouse gases,
responsible for 18% of the world's [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions"] greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO2 equivalents. By
comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO2. It produces 65% of human-related [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrous_oxide"] nitrous oxide
(which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO2) and 37% of all human-induced [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane"] methane (which
is 23 times as warming as CO2.) It also generates 64% of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia"] ammonia emission. Livestock expansion is cited
as a key factor driving deforestation; in the Amazon basin 70% of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_of_the_Amazon_Rainforest"] previously forested area is now occupied
by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops.[168] Through deforestation and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_degradation"] land degradation, livestock
is also driving reductions in biodiversity. Furthermore, the UNEP states that "[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_emissions"] methane emissions from global
livestock are projected to increase by 60 per cent by 2030 under current practices and consumption
patterns."[162] 
Farmyard [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_digester"] anaerobic digester
converts waste plant material and
manure from livestock into [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogas"] biogas
fuel.
Land and water issues 
Land transformation, the use of land to yield goods and services, is the most substantial way humans alter
the Earth's ecosystems, and is the driving force causing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss"] biodiversity loss. Estimates of the amount of land
transformed by humans vary from 39 to 50%.[169] Land degradation, the long-term decline in ecosystem
function and productivity, is estimated to be occurring on 24% of land worldwide, with cropland
overrepresented.[170] Land management is the driving factor behind degradation; 1.5 billion people rely
upon the degrading land. Degradation can be through deforestation, desertification, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_erosion"] soil erosion, mineral
depletion, acidification, or salinization.[121]
Eutrophication, excessive nutrient enrichment in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_ecosystem"] aquatic ecosystems resulting in [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algal_bloom"] algal blooms and anoxia,
leads to [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_kill"] fish kills, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_of_biodiversity"] loss of biodiversity, and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses.
Excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland, as well as high livestock stocking densities
cause nutrient (mainly [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen"] nitrogen and phosphorus) [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff"] runoff and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaching_(agriculture)"] leaching from agricultural land. These

of groundwater, with harmful effects on human populations.[171] Fertilisers also reduce terrestrial
biodiversity by increasing competition for light, favouring those species that are able to benefit from the
added nutrients.[172]Agriculture accounts for 70 percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources.[173][174]
Agriculture is a major draw on water from aquifers, and currently draws from those underground water
sources at an unsustainable rate. It is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern China, the
 Upper Ganges and the western US are being depleted, and new research extends these problems to
aquifers in Iran, Mexico and Saudi Arabia.[175] Increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by
industry and urban areas, meaning that [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_scarcity"] water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the world's
growing population with reduced water resources.[176] [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_water"] Agricultural water usage can also cause major environmental problems, including the
destruction of natural wetlands, the spread of water-borne diseases, and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging, when irrigation is
performed incorrectly.[177]
Pesticides
Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5 million short tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests
has remained relatively constant.[178] The World Health Organization estimated in 1992 that three million
pesticide poisonings occur annually, causing 220,000 deaths.[179] Pesticides select for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide_resistance"] pesticide resistance in
the pest population, leading to a condition termed the "pesticide treadmill" in which pest resistance warrants
the development of a new pesticide.[180]
An alternative argument is that the way to "save the environment" and prevent famine is by using pesticides
and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues
website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'.[181][182] However, critics argue that a trade-off
 between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable,[183] and that pesticides simply replace good 
Spraying a crop with a [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide"] pesticide
agronomic practices such as crop rotation.[180] The [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push%E2%80%93pull_agricultural_pest_management"] Push–pull agricultural pest management technique
involves intercropping, using plant aromas to repel pests from crops (push) and to lure them to a place from which they can then be removed
(pull).[184]
Contributions to climate change
Agriculture, and in particular animal husbandry, is responsible for [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions"] greenhouse gas emissions of CO2 and a percentage of the world's methane, and
future land infertility, and the displacement of wildlife. Agriculture contributes to climate change by anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases,
and by the conversion of non-agricultural land such as forest for agricultural use.[185] Agriculture, forestry and land-use change contributed around
20 to 25% to global annual emissions in 2010.[186] A range of policies can reduce the risk of negative climate change impacts on
agriculture,[187][188] and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions_from_agriculture"] greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture sector.[189][190][191]
Sustainability
Page 10
Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil
fertility. There is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and
 ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. A solution would be to give value to
ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and
interests.[192] Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed, such as the
reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland, or the
preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.[193]
Technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable.[194]
Technology permits innovations like [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_tillage"] conservation tillage, a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion,
 reduces water pollution, and enhances carbon sequestration.[195] Other potential practices include conservation
agriculture, agroforestry, improved grazing, avoided grassland conversion, and biochar.[196][197] Current mono-crop
farming practices in the United States preclude widespread adoption of sustainable practices, such as 2-3 crop
rotations that incorporate grass or hay with annual crops, unless negative emission goals such as soil carbon [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_tillage"] Terraces, conservation
sequestration become policy.[198]  tillage and conservation
buffers reduce [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_erosion"] soil erosion

food production if adopted in combination with each other; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies farm in Iowa.
could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, it found that the number of people at risk
from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.[138] The food
demand of Earth's projected population, with current climate change predictions, could be satisfied by improvement of agricultural methods,
expansion of agricultural areas, and a sustainability-oriented consumer mindset.[199]
Energy dependence 
Since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of
energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes from
 fossil fuel sources.[200] Between the 1960s and the 1980s, the Green Revolution transformed agriculture
around the globe, with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat
and 60% to 150% for rice, depending on geographic area)[201] as [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population"] world population doubled. Heavy reliance
on [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrochemical"] petrochemicals has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural
output.[202]

Indirect consumption includes the manufacture of Agriculture and food system share (%) of total energy
fertilizers, pesticides, and farm machinery.[202] In  consumption by three industrialized nations
particular, the production of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_fertilizer"] nitrogen fertilizer can account for over half of agricultural

Plastic pollution
Plastic products are used extensively in agriculture, for example to increase crop yield and improve the efficiency of water and agrichemical use.
“Agriplastic” products include films to cover [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse"] greenhouses and tunnels, mulch to cover soil (e.g. to suppress weeds, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_conservation"] conserve water, increase soil
temperature and aid fertilizer application), shade cloth, pesticide containers, seedling trays, protective mesh and irrigation tubing. The polymers most
commonly used in these products are low- density polyethylene (LPDE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), polypropylene (PP) and
polyvinyl chloride (PVC).[208]
The total amount of plastics used in agriculture is difficult to quantify. A 2012 study reported that almost 6.5 million tonnes per year were consumed
globally while a later study estimated that global demand in 2015 was between 7.3 million and 9 million tonnes. Widespread use of plastic mulch and
lack of systematic collection and management have led to the generation of large amounts of mulch residue.Weathering and degradation eventually
cause the mulch to fragment. These fragments and larger pieces of plastic accumulate in soil. Mulch residue has been measured at levels of 50 to 260
kg per hectare in topsoil in areas where the mulch has been used for more than 10 years, which confirms that mulching is a major source of both
microplastic and macroplastic contamination of soil.[208]
Agricultural plastics, especially plastic films, are not easy to recycle because of high contamination levels (up to 40- 50% by weight contamination by
pesticides, fertilizers, soil and debris, moist vegetation, silage juice water, and UV stabilizers) and collection difficulties . Therefore, they are often
buried or abandoned in fields and watercourses or burned. These disposal practices lead to soil degradation and can result in contamination of soils
and leakage of microplastics into the marine environment as a result of precipitation run-off and tidal washing. In addition, additives in residual plastic
film (such as UV and thermal stabilizers) may have deleterious effects on crop growth, soil structure,nutrient transport and salt levels. There is a risk
that plastic mulch will deteriorate soil quality, deplete soil organic matter stocks, increase soil water repellence and emit greenhouse gases.
Microplastics released through fragmentation of agricultural plastics can absorb and concentrate contaminants capable of being passed up the trophic
chain.[208]

Disciplines
Agricultural economics 
Agricultural economics is economics as it relates to the "production, distribution and consumption of
[agricultural] goods and services".[210] Combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing
and business as a discipline of study began in the late 1800s, and grew significantly through the 20th
century.[211] Although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent, major trends in agriculture
 have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history, ranging from tenant
farmers and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharecropping"] sharecropping in the post-[URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War"] American Civil War Southern United States[212] to the European
 feudal system of manorialism.[213] In the United States, and elsewhere, food costs attributed to food
processing, distribution, and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_marketing"] agricultural marketing, sometimes referred to as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_value_chain"] value chain, have risen while
the costs attributed to farming have declined. This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined

 as this 1846 meeting of the Anti-Corn
Law League.[209] 
concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_surplus"] economic surplus from producers
(farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.[214]
National government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products, in
the form of taxation, subsidies, tariffs and other measures.[215] Since at least the 1960s, a combination of
trade restrictions, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate_policy"] exchange rate policies and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and the developed world. In the 1980s, non-
subsidized farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm
products. Between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, several international agreements limited agricultural tariffs, subsidies and other trade
restrictions.[216]
However, as of 2009, there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural
products with the most trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the oilseeds, sesame had the most taxation, but
overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a
greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy.[215] Despite this progress, certain crops,
such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-
subsidized farmers.[217] Unprocessed commodities such as corn, soybeans, and cattle are generally graded to indicate quality, affecting the price the
producer receives. Commodities are generally reported by production quantities, such as volume, number or weight.[218]
Agricultural science
 Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology"] biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural,
economic and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science"] social sciences used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. It covers topics such as
agronomy, plant breeding and genetics, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_pathology"] plant pathology, crop modelling, soil science, entomology,
production techniques and improvement, study of pests and their management, and study of adverse
environmental effects such as soil degradation, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_management"] waste management, and bioremediation.[219][220]
The scientific study of agriculture began in the 18th century, when [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Friedrich_Mayer_(agriculturist)"] Johann Friedrich Mayer conducted
experiments on the use of [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gypsum"] gypsum (hydrated [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_sulphate"] calcium sulphate) as a fertilizer.[221] Research became more
systematic when in 1843, [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lawes"] John Lawes and Henry Gilbert began a set of long-term agronomy field
experiments at [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothamsted_Research_Station"] Rothamsted Research Station in England; some of them, such as the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Grass_Experiment"] Park Grass Experiment,
are still running.[222][223] In America, the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatch_Act_of_1887"] Hatch Act of 1887 provided funding for what it was the first to call
"agricultural science", driven by farmers' interest in fertilizers.[224] In agricultural entomology, the USDA
began to research biological control in 1881; it instituted its first large program in 1905, searching Europe and
Japan for natural enemies of the [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymantria_dispar_dispar"] gypsy moth and [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown-tail"] brown-tail moth, establishing [URL: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitoid"] parasitoids (such as solitary
wasps) and predators of both pests in the USA.[225][226][227]

Policy
 Agricultural policy is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign
agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome

 Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global
agricultural regulations and agreements. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large
corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of
conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the
number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.[232]
